Malvert pee red.
I'm glad to see others appreciating this movie as much as I do...",1074643200,3,107,4.4
1246914,5,B00001U0G5,"I just have to say how much my bestfriend and i love this freakin movie.  We each own our own copy and watch and talk about constantly.  There is not a day that goes by that we are not quoting lines from this movie.  That would be ""sbsurd!""  This movies has brought us utter joy!  We have been watching since 1994, and still appreciate even more everytime we watch it.  I am glad there are others out there whom love the humor in this great flick!!  I need to meet the breather.  Heres breather!
You like eggplant?? And my favorite, ""one paper clip, Harlow that's yours!""",1074470400,2,571,4.320754716981132
1246915,4,B00001U0G5,"Nowadays, I know a lot of people who are incapable of distinguishing between things that are stupid because of a failure on the part of the creator(s), such as 'Charlies Angels 2: Full Throttle' and deliberate stupidity, such as what Adam Sandler does, perhaps better described as 'absurdist' humor.  This flick is by far the latter.  Is it stupid?  Oh, yeah.  You can actually feel your brain cells corroding as you watch it.  Feels kinda like a soda in your skull.  But it's also funny, funny, funny.  The Breather is one of my favorite movie maniacs, and the two times the film stops to have a brief discussion with the audience on the killer's identity or the film's rating are brilliant.  In a stupid way.  If you thought the Scream movies were really clever, or if you want to know more about what somebody did last summer, then this isn't the movie for you.  If you liked 'Charlie's Angels 2', then not only is this movie not for you, but you need to have yourself put away before you pollute the gene pool.  If, however, you want to put your brain in neutral and take a tour of Wackyland without the use of banned substances, then this budgetless wonder is my recommendation to you.  The only dangers are that the pacing - which was fine at the time - may seem frustrating to modern eyes, and that unless you like seventies and eighties horror, you might miss a few of the jokes.  But believe me, by that point, you won't care.",1071964800,4,1435,4.452107279693487
1246916,5,B00001U0G5,"I just finished watching Student Bodies again, a parody of old slasher movies, starts on Halloween night, Friday the 13th, etc...  Although not by Abrams Zucker, and Zucker, it is of the same genre with many really bad sight gags, and on-screen messages, such as ""not-dead, just unconscious, an important plot complication..."" and so on.  If you have never seen this move and like parodies of Halloween or Jason movies, go find a copy.  Unfortunately it is not currently available on DVD, but you can find it on VHS or Laserdisc.

1246917,4,B00001U0G5,"You have to love one of the earliest parodies of 70s horror flicks.
Some highlights of the film that make it hilarious:
* Our killer (you never see his face, just heavy breathing, gloves, and galoshes) is looking over weapons and picks the deadliest one of them all...an unfolded paperclip!! * The ongoing ""body count"" that flashes on the screen everytime someone dies! * Our killer talking to the teacher:  Teacher (on phone):  ""Why does your voice sound funny?  Killer:  ""Because I'm disguising it, schmuck!""  ""How?""  ""I'm talking through a rubber chicken.""  ""It sounded like you're talking through a rubber chicken.""  ""'Click!'""  ""Did you just hang up?""  ""No, I just said 'click.'"" * One of my favorite quotes as the principal ""confesses"":  ""All these years I've been naked underneath these clothes."" * The killer as he chases a girl:  ""Why do they always run?  Maybe it's the galoshes!  They're a dead giveaway!  Why do I wear them?  It's not even raining!"" *You have to love a movie that uses an eggplant for a murder weapon.
Okay, so the humor is bad and dated...but in the right mood with a lot of friends, it's downright funny.
I'm amazed that it's still in print.  Enjoy.",990489600,37,1180,4.733990147783251
1246918,4,B00001U0G5,"This movie is one of the earliest slasher flick parodies.  Some of the humor is dated, but most of the well-worn jokes were done here first.
There is no nudity, no gore, no bad language (with one exception) and no real violence.
I won't spoil why the film has an ""R"" raiting, but it is one of the better jokes in the movie.  (And terribly tame by today's standards.)
The story is silly. There are plot holes hig enough to drive a truck through.  (With big blinking signs pointing to them in some places.) Teenagers die in silly ways for having unauthorized sex. The dysfunctional heroine tries to figure out who is doing it in order to clear her name.  (It always seems like she is in the wrong place at the wrong time.) And wait until you see who gets crowned prom queen.
Not a perfect film, but worth getting. Better than alot of the recient slasher flick parodies with larger budgets.",985392000,6,887,4.423312883435583

The kind of movie that tries too hard to be funny, and the effort is so obvious that it fails to do so. Sure, there are moments of funniness in it... but on the whole, it's just BAD. If you ever have occasion to see it (ONCE) for free or something, go ahead and waste some time with it... but under no circumstances should you pay for this.

1247059,3,B00001U0G5,"Most Hardcore horror fans have a list of movies that have never had a dvd release or that have been out of print for a long time and need a re-release. Legend Films has teamed with Paramount to help shorten that list a bit. The title that I was most happy to see being released on DVD for the first time is 1982 slasher comedy Student Bodies.

This comedy/horror flick is like a cross between CARRIE & AIRPLANE and predates the Scary Movie  franchise by 19 years.
STUDENT BODIES centers around the students and staff of Lamab High, as one by one they are picked off by The Breather.

The Breather is a galoshes wearing killer with a bizzare choice of weapons and apparently a bad case of asthma. The movie starts out on Friday the 13th and jumps right into the action as promiscuous teens are picked off with everything from paper clips to horse head bookends and including an eggplant.

There is an on screen death count just to help viewers keep track of the action and also a nifty arrow that helps viewers realize when a door is left unlocked or a window opened.

My favorite moment of the show though, hands down is the breakaway to a news desk where the movie s R rating is discussed and then earned. The cast is full of campy actors who specialize in cheese and do great in keeping the bad jokes and sight gags flowing throughout the movie.

There is one character named Malbert who is honestly a human cartoon. The guy is probably 7 foot tall and has to weigh less than 100 pounds. He contorts his limbs throughout the movie in ways that had me doing a double take as it didn t seem humanly possible. In the credits the actor is listed as The Stick so I have no idea of his real name.

If you like Scary Movie (Sydney!) then you will love this, the grandfather of horror comedies. If you are a child of the 80 s then go out and pick this one up, I guarantee you will have fun. This movie, much like the Zucker Brothers classic Airplane! is full of great quotes ""Did you just hang up on me?"" and there is definitely unlimited re-watch-ability.

The release is a bit bare of special features, although the original trailer is included and is fun to watch as well. The SRP of this movie is $14.99 and is worth every penny. I definitely recommend you go out and purchase this one, you will not regret it. --Friday Night Frights on SwitchPlanet.com

This killer comedy is the original teenage parody horror film taken to the extreme! The screams are as frequent as the laughs as a crazed, perverted heavy-breathing murderer terrorizes Lamab High with a series of mysterious deaths. Everyone is a suspect and no one is safe from the hilarious twists and turns as Breather terrorizes and kills sex-starved couples.

When the body count rises, one student attempts to solve the mystery and instead finds herself a suspect. Does she survive or become another victim? It s anyone s guess in this satirical romp of horror!",1387497600,,2919,4.449438202247191

As I and my wife watched this mater piece unfold, we were transported to the world of the director. The lighting, the acting, direction, and story line are on par with some of the greats in the movie world. Casablanca, Kramer VS Kramer, Star Wars, and A Mr Magoo Christmas.
 I truly believe that depth and touching subject matter of this film have touched me and effected my life in ways that will continue to be relieved to me as I age and continue to experience life through a lens that this film helped create.
 Without giving away the ending, it has a twist to it that you could never see coming. The ending shocked me, amused me, and brought tears to my eyes.

A talley of murders, strange murder weapons, and a twist ending!  Who could imagine being murdered by an eggplant?! Not to mention the main character in the film desperately tries to keep everyone from having sex (the virgin never gets killed ploy), winds up being the suspect. This movie is still hillarious 30 years later. If you like the horror/comedy spoof, this is the film for you. Strange, yet funny, this movie brings back so many childhood memories for me.

1247123,5,B00001U0G5,"I almost gave up hope this was ever going to DVD, but it's finally here.

This movie is funny beyond belief....a crazy comedy. I remember watching this film late one night because there was nothing else on. This is my favorite stupid horror spoof of all time.

When Student Bodies first came out in 1981 it was completely unique, no one had ever done a horror spoof before. Hense the original Movie poster proclaiming ""At last The world's first comedy horror movie"".

Student Bodies was written and directed by Mickey Rose, who collaborated with Woody Allen on the screenplays for Allen's early films.
The film had a completely unknown and still unknown cast *Kristen Riter* Toby Badger, *Matt Goldsby* Hardy, *Richard Brando* The Breather,
Student Bodies had a notoriously difficult production and producer Michael Ritchie, Ritchie opted to take his name off the picture, instead using the Director's Guild pseudonym.

This movie has become quite popular since it's release on video in the early eighties.

This comedy is every teenage horror film you've ever seen from the 70's and 80's and every horror movie cliche is taken to hilarous extremes of laughter. The screams are as frequent as the laughs as a crazy murderer or maybe murderess terrorizes Lamab High.

But the senior class is not going to take it lying down most of all Toby Badger...*KRISTEN RITER*. A mousy good girl you know like in all horror films Toby's the virgin. Toby's putting herslef and her beau in some silly positions so she can find out who's ""the breather"". A killer who is murdering her non-viriginal friends with a pair of rubber gloves and garbage bags and other unusal weapons of choice.

With help from her boyfriend Hardy...*MATT GOLDSBY*(Student Bodies,Frances) who's the town nerd of sorts who's always there by Toby's side if she needs him. Hardy's trying his best to protect and save Toby. But at the same time trying to protect and save himself.

Toby and Hardy are Ducking such lethal weapons such as paper clips, blackboard erasers and horse-head bookends, they set about trying to find the mysterious ""Breather"" and other things that go bump in the night.

No one is safe from the crazy twists and turns of the looney plot, and a madcap twist of an ending. No one is Safe least of all the student bodies themselves. Football games, pep rallies, parades and senior proms provide background for a movie that leaves no horror movie cliche unexplored.

This movie is Rated R which actually I think is a joke onto itself because there is only slight nudity, little Gore, there's only a few bad words said in the entire movie, some lewds jokes but that's the best parts.

This movie is actually quite tame considering all the raunchy teen movies of the 80's and 90's that will follow it. But it is by far the best in my opinion.

Student Bodies was the movie that started the whole horror movie spoofs. This is a great film. Great laughs, Sharp ,Witty and of course purposely stupidly wonderful. I mean hello it's a comedy not shakespheare.

I first saw this movie on HBO in the early 1980s and laughed until it hurt.  I hadn't seen it again until this DVD release.

Lest you think we're suffering through the heyday of moronic spoof films (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Scary Movie, Meet the Spartans), consider the early 1980s and the glut of fatuous flicks such as Alfred Sole's Pandemonium, Greydon Clark's Wacko, Howard R. Cohen's Saturday the 14th, or this one, Mickey Rose's Student Bodies.

By far the cheapest of the lot, Bodies was written and co-directed by Rose, the onetime writing partner of Woody Allen who helped pen What's Up Tiger Lily?, Bananas, and the classic Take the Money and Run. Any knack for subtlety or humor was sorely lacking by the time Rose wrote this spoof -- the comedy is as broad as a barn and strictly borscht belt.

Filled to the brim with bad puns, awkward sight gags, Dr. Pepper product placement, and parodies of then-recent horror films such as Halloween and Friday the 13th, Bodies stars Kristen Riter as Toby the good girl virgin and Matthew Goldsby as Hardy, the nerd with a heart of gold. The pair investigates a string of murders by The Breather (Richard Brando), an unseen killer who wears galoshes and disguises his voice with a rubber chicken. The Breather knocks off ""wild and crazy"" oversexed high school students with obtuse objects such as an eggplant, a chalkboard eraser, and a horse head bookend.

Always the mark of quality, Student Bodies was produced by Allen Smithee, this time around taken by Michael Ritchie, who also co-directed. That he disavowed the film while leaving his name on his next one, the misfiring Robin Williams/Walter Matthau ""comedy"" The Survivors, is a testament to just how bad this film truly is.",1214352000,3,1728,4.887372013651877

Full of some nice visual gags and even funnier dialogue, Student Bodies just comes off as way too tame considering the kind of films it is spoofing.  You won't find any nudity, gore, or barely any foul language in Student Bodies, which is disappointing in itself.  Not to mention that it loses steam by the time it begins to wind down, with some just plain unfunny moments as well.

1247140,5,B00001U0G5,"If you think the horror spoof comedy genre started with Scary Movie and Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth, think again.  Horror was all the rage in the early 1980s (as the introduction to this film points out, all 26 horror movies released during the previous year made a profit), so it comes as no surprise that some filmmaker would come along and try to exploit the genre for laughs (and money) - and so was born Student Bodies.  I know what you're thinking when you see the title - naked girls - but I'm going to have to disappoint you on that score.  Even though the film received an R rating, there's almost nothing R-rated about it - no actual nudity, very little profanity, and only the slightest amount of blood.  Sure, kids keep getting killed for having sex, but none of them actually live long enough to do it.  And the killer uses whatever he can find, so forget about machetes and knives and think eggplant, erasers, and paper clips.

A distinctly Halloween-esque opening scene introduces us to The Breather.  Actually, you could say The Breather introduces himself to us because, even though the camera shows us each scene from his perspective, he maintains a fairly constant monologue around all of his heavy breathing.  In this fashion, he gives us a number of the film's funniest lines, such as when he's struggling to climb stairs, stepping in chewing gum, questioning his choice of footwear, or calling in to announce when and where he is going to kill next (using  a rubber chicken to disguise his voice).  We don't know who the killer really is until the end, of course, but there's no shortage of suspects at the local high school.  Don't expect any yellow tape to appear around crime scenes, by the way, because the school conducts its own investigation.  Principal Peters (Joe Talarowski) isn't going to let the murder of several students ruin the biggest school day of the year (due to budget cuts, the school has to have all extracurricular activities such as the big game, the big parade, the prom, etc. on the same day, and today's the day) - not even when a second couple are murdered at the big funeral of the first dead couple.  Instead of cops, Principal Peters calls on a few teachers and a schizophrenic psychologist to name the killer.  Meanwhile, do-gooder Toby (Kristen Riter), who has the bad habit of discovering most of the victims, conducts a secret investigation of her own.  Who could the murderer be?  Principal Peters?  The horse head bookends-obsessed (and constantly scene-stealing) shop teacher Mr. Dumpkin (Joe Flood)?  The seriously addled contortionist of a janitor?  The girl who would do anything to make sure she gets elected prom queen?  Weirdoes abound on this campus, so just about anyone could be The Breather.

I should point out the fact that you don't have to be a horror fan to enjoy Student Bodies - you might not recognize the references to films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls, or Carrie, but that won't stop you from appreciating all of the comedy on display here.  Don't let the fact that producer Michael Ritchie went the Allen Smithee route in the credits worry you, either.  This movie is almost bursting at the seams with great one-liners.  Not only is Student Bodies a genuinely funny movie, it actually manages to stay consistently funny from start to finish - and all without resorting to the exceedingly raunchy level of similar films today.  It is possible that a few viewers might be offended by a few things here and there (such as the manner in which a blind student and a crippled student are portrayed), but I'd be lying if I said these weren't some of the movie's funniest moments.  If you have a sense of humor and don't adopt an elitist attitude toward dumb jokes, I'm willing to bet you'll find much more satisfaction in Student Bodies than all of the films in the Scary Movie franchise combined.

For the life of me I could remember the name of it....finally I stumbled onto it.  I'm so glad!  I can't wait to show it to my kids and everyone else who has looked at me like I was crazy when I try to tell them about it.  I love the ""notice"" statements and the gum on the steps.  Those are probably my favorite parts.  Great Movie!!!",1158364800,2,486,3.9895833333333335

I'd explain the parts that I could remember, like people being killed with horsehead bookends and a paper clip and the janitor that peed red. I knew I saw it in the eighties, but no one knew what I was talking about. After searching this site and viewing almost all of the slasher movies available, I have finally found the movie I watched so long ago and imagine how let down I felt when I couldn't even buy it on DVD :( I hope this is released soon. Just recently I have been collecting all the older horror movies I grew up watching. This is one of the funnier ones I hope to add to my collection.",1155772800,2,766,4.147651006711409

Some great jokes and gags making fun of every movie from FRIDAY THE 13TH to WHEN A STRANGER CALLS

This is perfection.. and the ending is just as confusing as any horro movie should be.

I just wish they'd hurry up and release this on DVD PLEASE!!!

I ordered my copy from amazon.com back when it was in print.. now I see there are only used versions.. but it's worth it.

I recently purchased the tape at a video shop. But i was disappointed to find out it is not available on dvd which really sucks. I think paramount should finally make this movie available on dvd.,1076630400,9,345,4.0144927536231885
1247156,5,B00001U0G5,"This movie is funny beyond belief....a killa crazy comedy.
Paramount Studios should absolutely finally release this movie on dvd.

When Student Bodies first came out in 1981 it was completely unique, no one had ever done a horror spoof before. Hense the original Movie poster proclaiming ""At last The world's first comedy horror movie"".
Student Bodies was written and directed by Mickey Rose, who collaborated with Woody Allen on the screenplays for Allen's early films.
The film had a completely unknown and still unknown cast *Kristen Riter* Toby Badger, *Matt Goldsby* Hardy, *Richard Brando* The Breather,
Student Bodies had a notoriously difficult production and producer Michael Ritchie, Ritchie opted to take his name off the picture, instead using the Director's Guild pseudonym.

This movie has become quite popular since it's release on video in the early eighties and is still available on VHS and can be seen sometimes on late night/early morning television becoming a CULT CLASSIC.....BUT WHEN IS THIS CULT CLASSIC GOING TO BE AVAILABLE ON DVD?

This killa Crazy comedy is every teenage horror film you've ever seen from the 70's and 80's and every horror movie cliche is taken to hilarous extremes of laughter. The screams are as frequent as the laughs as a crazy murderer or maybe murderess terrorizes Lamab High.

But the senior class is not going to take it lying down most of all Toby Badger...*KRISTEN RITER*. a mousy good girl you know like in all horror films Toby's the virgin. Toby's putting herslef and her beau in some silly positions so she can find out who's ""the breather"". a killer who is murdering her non-viriginal friends with a pair of rubber gloves and garbage bags and other unusal weapons of choice.

With help from her boyfriend Hardy...*MATT GOLDSBY*(Student Bodies,Frances) who's the town nerd of sorts who's always there by Toby's side if she needs him. Hardy's trying his best to protect and save Toby. But at the same time trying to protect and save himself.
Toby and Hardy are Ducking such lethal weapons such as paper clips, blackboard erasers and horse-head bookends, they set about trying to find the mysterious ""Breather"" and other things that go bump in the night.

No one is safe from the crazy twists and turns of the looney plot, and a madcap twist of an ending. No one is Safe least of all the student bodies themselves. Football games, pep rallies, parades and senior proms provide background for a movie that leaves no horror movie cliche unexplored.

This movie is Rated R which actually i think is a joke onto itself. cause there is only slight nudity, little Gore, there's only a few bad words said in the entire movie. some lewds jokes but that's the best parts.

This movie is actually quite tame considering all the raunchy teen movies of the 80's and 90's that will follow it. But It is by far the best in my opinion.

Student Bodies was the movie that started the whole horror movie spoofs. This is a great film that I hope will be available on dvd one day. Great laughs, Sharp ,Witty and of course purposely stupidly wonderful. I mean hello it's a comedy not shakespheare.

Since it was made in the slasher heyday the look and feel of the film are right on par with the films that it spoofs.
