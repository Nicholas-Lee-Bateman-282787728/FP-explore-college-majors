1356726,4,B00004UEDO,"A scared illegal immigrant witnesses a homicide and comes to a Texas sheriff played by Brad Johnson. But, the case is not easy, considering who  is the murderer. What complicates this story even further is that the  Sheriff falls passionately in love with the witness. It's that aspect that  we adore with 4 stars. *G*",967680000,4,318,4.745454545454545
1356727,3,B00004UEDO,"It was just ok.  I am surprised by so many 4-5 star ratings.  The movie isn't well acted by most of the cast.  The Hispanics are stereotypical at best and deliver their lines like wooden characters from some old spaghetti western.  The cliche fest never ends, with every possible turn.  Every line and plot story has been taken from other movies.  I watched and didn't hate it, but it wasn't very good really.  3 stars is generous.

Mostly I am bugged that Amazon forces us to now write reviews just to rate a movie.",1505347200,,516,4.414893617021277

1356729,3,B00004UEDO,"Spoiler alert: It's like a made-for-tv film that promotes illegal immigration. Please, do not confuse this with the ""honor"" of the original ""Texas lawman"". There is no honor in this film. The good cops and the bad cops break the law as a way of doing business. The bad cops use and deal cocaine over the border, and the good cops turn a blind eye to this and illegal immigration, until a rich couple are killed and the sheriff falls in love with a Mexican woman. Then, the drug running is bad, but illegal immigration is still okay. The bad cops turn a blind eye to human trafficking, although it is unclear why. It isn't connected to their drugs, but they mention it is a source of income for them? It isn't clear. The sheriff marries his illegal girlfriend, and her illegal friends are released from jail and get to stay. No mention is ever made of her family who she promised to bring over. The movie gives the impression that the entire town supports illegals, but the only thing we see is the diner. It is an old-time western without the values, or I should say upside down values. If you remember the old westerns, you probably won't like it, but if you are in your twenties, you might, although the quality will annoy you.",1505088000,,1229,4.442477876106195

Story highlights the desperation of immigrants trying to enter country illegally, but with a lot of bad patrolmen doing bad things.  It was decent acting but the storyline was pretty depressing.  Not fit for children/teens to watch (some nudity/sexual abuse, bad cops doing bad things, lots of killing to cover up bad deeds, etc.)  However, despite that assessment, I did watch the whole thing (although there was one point I almost turned it off).

CORNY! Predictable and implausible!  I'm not particularly informed on border security issues, but I've never heard of border patrol behaving this way in the US. Without knowing for fact this type thing goes on with our BP, I'm a bit uncomfortable with this murder premise.  Now if some points are illuminated by the message of how refugees can be treated (and are) I suppose that brings this from 2 to 3 stars.  Really bad acting, but still somewhat engaging characters.

I gave it 5 stars because that's what I tend to do when I enjoy a movie. I rarely write reviews when I don't enjoy a movie, but this movie made feel good, and it had a moral lesson.

In America, Every Dream, Has A Price - ""Across the Line"" movie poster tag line.

Three and a half DESPERATE Stars. Across the Line (aka Deadly Crossing) is a 2000 film where a small town sheriff is caught in a web of intrigue involving politics, foreign harassment, illegal border crossings, budding friendships, and heinous crimes. The plot also covers a strong, smart, desperate female. Brad Johnson, Sigal Erez, Marshall Teague, and Brian Bloom are excellent in their roles. There are also very good performances by Justin Urich, Julio Dolce Vita, Carlos Carrasco, Luis Contreras, Mark Adair-Rios, Stephen Spacek, Roger Velasco, Julia Vera, Steve Vinovich, Courtney Gebgart and John Vargas with a cameo by Adrienne Barbeau. Directed by Martin Spottl who co-wrote the script and co-produced the film with lead actress Sigal Erez. Very Definitely Recommended as a good border patrol, immigrant film with a wild plot.

1357081,3,B00004UEDO,"ACROSS THE LINE is an earnest, thoughtful film about the plight of illegal immigrants, but as an action or thriller, it's only borderline.  Director Martin Spottl keeps things moving at a good pace, but much of the action borders on the improbable and fills some of the roles too stereotypically.  Sigal Eraz who stars as Miranda co-wrote the script and she infuses a sense of wonder and awe in these Guatemalan natives who think everything in America will be wonderful.  The realistic fact that America has its share of no goodnicks hits home hard.  Brad Johnson is a sturdy, heroic figure as the sheriff who faces losing an election, until his crooked brother steps in.  The plot basically revolves around Eraz who witnesses the border patrol (led by a sinister Brian Bloom) off a bunch of drug dealers they were dealing with and also a vacationing couple (an underused Adrienne Barbeau as the wife) who happened to witness the crime.  The late character actor JC Quinn has a nice role as a restaurant proprietor, and Justin Urich does a good job as the naive rookie who ends up getting caught in the mechanisms of Bloom's nastiness.

1357085,4,B00004UEDO,"In the wonderfully scripted, and well Directed ""Across the  Line,"" writer, Sigal Eriz, and Director & Co-writer, Martin Spottl  have managed to make a movie, that I consider ""CROSSOVER"" - as in  C&W music crossing over into the mainstream.  It's not a Latino film,  it's not an American film.  It's Universal.  It's a ""Love Story.""  - It will appeal to all!  This script is a perfect example of a work which  shows a slice of life of a young, Latina ""illegal,"" immigrant.  I  don't want to give away any of the details of the story, this is not a  ""review"" -  This is my way of letting people know that there are  as many latino, Asian, (Fill in your ethnic group here), and other stories  out there to be lived, told, written, Produced, Directed, and released  Theatrically that could rake in piles of $  ------  If a smart Hollywood  Producer would just say to himself, ""Hmmm, in California alone the  Latin population is OVER 50% --------I should be able to get some of their  moolah by Producing some Latino scripts.""",968630400,2,1021,4.555555555555555

I wish to see those filmmakers again, maybe a TV series.
The director did a great job, the actress also wrote it. It shows both side of immigration.
Highly recommended !",1523145600,,212,4.461538461538462

Amazon, why would a pay to watch a movie when your selection of free movies indicates that you have no taste?  Oh, why put movies in multiple categories/genres?  Perhaps to mislead the Prime Members on what is actually available?  Get real!",1510963200,,387,4.617647058823529

On the other hand I did watch it start to finish, mostly because I was too lazy to cue up another. But I am also curious now about the entire movie production business and how something so menial could have been made. Obviously someone had to invest cash to make it happen, tho, so how does this all work?
I mean, while on the one hand it seems to be money wasted, on the other it is sort of nice to know that apparently anyone can make a movie and get it  distributed. So maybe this is good for moving making wanna bees?
