I can only think that this is an early effort of Mr. Stones because of the MASSIVE OVERUSE of uh's and um's during pauses in the dialogue.  I found it to be so distracting I couldn't focus on his lesson as I cringed at the expectation of the next uh or um.  My comments may seem trivial but you ARE going to notice it.  Part of any in person teaching, group presentation, or any communication intended for an audience must include the requisite polish to avoid the audience focusing on the communication style and not the content.  This DVD should be redone by Woodhall Music.",1392768000,,678,4.265625
