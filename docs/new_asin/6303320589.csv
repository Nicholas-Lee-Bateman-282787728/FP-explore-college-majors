629414,3,6303320589,"I recently got this movie, at just over $5. I mean usually this movie is listed at prices that range from no less than $40 and all the way up as high as $70,$80 or maybe even $100, if you can believe that. I will tell you that the movie is nowhere worth that! The first stoty about the car is like a Twilight Zone episode mixed with a little Lifetime original movie feel to it. In other words it's not good! The second about the vampire thing is really odd, until the end, when it comes clear what's really going on. It's an ok story, I guess. The third about the little boy is pretty good. It has some really creepy moments in it. If not for the third story it would not be worth watching ever again. I give the first story a 1 out 5, the second a 2 out 5, and the third a 4.5 out of 5. As a whole the movie gets a 3 out of 5, mainly because the last story saves what would have been a not so good movie .",1168646400,4,906,3.798941798941799
629415,4,6303320589,"""Dead Of Night"" was originally produced as a follow-up to the classic ""Trilogy Of Terror"" on ABC's ""Movie Of The WeeK"".
 It was written by Richard Matheson and directed by Dan Curtis(the same team who produced Trilogy), and while not as great as Trilogy Of Terror"" is a very good antholgy in its own right.
 ""Second Chance"" featured a young Ed Begley Jr. as a car restorer and is an interesting tale of the imagination.
 ""No Such Thing As Vampires"" is a nice tale of mystery about a couple in an eastern country who are being stalked by a vampire(or so it seems).
 The last story is (I think) the best. ""Bobby"" is about a mother whose grief over her lost son causes her to enlist some help she really shouldn't.
 I'm sorry if I'm being vague, but I think that this is a really good movie, and if you can find it, see it,you'll be happy you did.",1111536000,5,844,4.283018867924528
629416,3,6303320589,"I'd caught the last 15 minutes of this movie on television a few years ago, and spent some time and effort tracking it down. Being 41 myself, I well remember the wonderful old ""ABC Tuesday Movie of the Week"" telefilms of the 70's (and Wednesday MOW's and so on). This, I guess I'd missed the first time around.
Anyway, as ""horror anthology"" this isn't a success at all. I understand this was the pilot for a possible series of strange and unusual tales, so it isn't all horror. In fact, the first story is an interesting romantic time-travel tale, by noted writer Jack Finney. In that story, a man who restores a classic, antique car, is taken by that car back in time to before the car was wrecked. ...
The second story, is about a man using his village's fear of vampire legends to dispatch his own enemies - not much interest or tension there.
The third story - aha! PAYDIRT!!!
This is the story worth waiting for, the story you want to see, the story like no story you've ever seen before, and that will keep you jumping throughout. I'll tell you  nothing about it - you'll have to buy this video to see it yourself, and believe me - you'll be glad you did!",1036108800,10,1161,4.350230414746544

In 1975 Trilogy of Terror was a success so Dan Curtis directed this follow up although it is not as well known.  There are three stories about a trip into the past involving an antique car, a vampire and a woman who brings her drowned son back from the dead.

629478,3,6303320589,"A collection of 3 stories written by the great Richard Matheson and produced by Dan Curtis. The 1st story is totally forgettable, the 2nd story is ok and the 3rd story is the best. I think the dvd would have been much better had they eliminated the 1st story and expanded the 2nd and 3rd stories.
 The extras have the 1st of a proposed Dead of Night series. A dull story with dull characters! I like the gothic look that is a trademark of Curtis horror but he should have gotten Matheson to write this story as well.
 I am a huge Richard Matheson fan and his name is usually enough to get me to buy a dvd. But, due to time constraints, this is not his best. The 3 stars is mostly for the ""Bobby"" story.",1420502400,,702,4.116788321167883

629480,5,6303320589,"I bought this based on reading others' reviews and for once was not disappointed - watched ABC's Tue/Wed Movie of the Week faithfully back in 70s but didn't remember this one but thought, what the heck it's Dan Curtis, has to be good - first story is ok, kinda whimsical, second one is stupidly predictable, the third one - Bobby - is a total holy moly nerve jangling classic - absolutely knocks the socks off that Zuni doll ep w/Karen Black for sheer heart-pounding creepiness, why this isn't broadcast at Halloween (or Mother's Day) is beyond me - it's pure escalating terror - have watched it over a dozen times now and it's still makes me jump - one of the best deals I've ever found on Amazon - disc includes unsold Dan Curtis pilot w/Kerwin Mathews and Marj Dusay that's basically Dark Shadows for an 8pm viewing audience, interesting as a period piece - but Joan Hackett and Lee H Montgomery and a horrendous game of hide-and-seek are the reasons to buy this, you will not be disappointed!!!",1397088000,2,998,4.581005586592179
629481,4,6303320589,"Like many here, I saw ""Bobby"" when I was a kid myself, and it really frightened me. It is still frightening, maybe because we can all relate to being angry at overbearing mothers or to being little brats ourselves. It was actually on Trilogy of Terror II, which seems to be out of print, so it's great to find this here. (I bought Trilogy 2 on VHS and tranfered it myself, but this is better.) ""Bobby"" is worth the cost of the disc, and, as a bonus, 'Second Chance"" is a nicely-written little spooker that probably comes off better in print. The vampire movie is run-of-the-mill, and maybe best to skip over so you'll have time to see ""Bobby"" twice.",1394582400,,649,4.416666666666667
629482,4,6303320589,"This is a fine made-for-television movie done in three segments.  There was a possibility this was to become a TV show similar to the Twilight Zone, but unfortunately it never came to be.  The three stories deal with time travel, vampires and demons.  The disc is clear and has great sound.  There is very little defect in the print.  I highly recommend this movie.",1394323200,,365,4.640625

629484,5,6303320589,"After viewing this movie, I am convinced that Dan Curtis was and still is one of the greats in the horror genre, yes everything he did was not great, but he had more hits than misses.  Curtis was responsible for two sets of horror trilogy tv movies, Dead of Night and Trilogy of Terror, its really a split call as to which one is better, in my opinion Dead of Night wins hands down, and after viewing it I am surprised Curtis got away what he did in Dead of Night, as it was pushing the limits especially for a tv movie.

Two out of the three movies were very well put together, luckily the bad one is in the beginning, the two stand out stories are No such thing as a vampire and of course Bobby.  My only complaint about the vampire story, and I really did enjoy it, but I felt it ended abruptly, but the ending has one hell of a twist,  the story concerns, a mans wife being attacked by a vampire repeatedly during the night, causing a huge stir through the village, and the mans attempts to stop the vampire are futile, but I will say this all is not what it seems,  honestly I enjoyed Bobby as well, but I think this story was the stand out.

Then we come to Bobby, Bobby is a great story,  there is more to Bobby than what you will read in a lot of the other customer reviews, Bobby is a boy who drowned by accident, his mother grief stricken by the loss of Bobby gets involved in the black arts, bringing Bobby back from the dead, mother and son reunited end of story......  You'll have to see it for yourself.

This movie should be in any horror fans collection, it is criminal if it is not, I implore you, pick it up if you have not already.",1389398400,,1650,4.1152647975077885
629485,5,6303320589,"i recall seeing this movie on television many years ago and wanted a copy of it when i recently saw the title of it.  i remember the first and third stories but not the second story.  the first story starred ed begley, jr., as a college student who bought an old, run down classic car owned by a young man who, along with his girlfriend, tried to outrun a train and died.  after he fixed it up, he drove it to a nearby town and somehow ended up many years in the past.  a young couple drove off in his car even though he tried to stop them.  months later, he met a young woman who attended the same college he attended.  you'll have to watch the story to find out what happened next since i don't want to spoil the ending.  the second story stars patrick macnee as a married man whose wife thinks she's being attacked by a vampire.  the third story concerns a grieving wife whose son died a few months before who makes the mistake of using a spell to bring him back.  the dvd has some bonus items on it.  one shows some deleted scenes from the second story.  another is a story about a haunted house which stars two actors from the original dark shadows program.  i don't know if this was supposed to be a pilot for another series.",1384819200,,1231,4.169491525423729
629486,5,6303320589,"I cheated and skipped ahead to the last segment in this anthology video. And yes, all the positive reviews are accurate. Days later (and a number of other horror movies viewed since then...) the story still stands out. Refreshingly mean-spirited and just the right amount of supernatural. Recommended.",1371686400,,301,5.291666666666667
629487,3,6303320589,"I purchased this for ""Bobby"", the third story in this trilogy of terror.

It doesn't disappoint. It's tense, scary and a genuinely involving story where a mother uses dark forces to bring her son back from the dead. It works; but dear Bobby isn't the same as she remembered him. The episode is expertly directed, bringing more tension, atmosphere and genuine thrills than many feature films. It doesn't even shed a drop of blood; this is how to make a scary short story. Lee Montgomery and Joan Hackett are very good in their roles. Highly recommended.

The other two; ""Second Chance"" and ""No Such Thing as a Vampire"" frankly pale in comparison and only serve as a light warm up to ""Bobby"". The first one reminds you of those harmless ""Twilight Zone"" episodes that go by easily and the second one is a long buildup to a nifty twist but it's never very gripping or suspenseful to begin with.

As for disc quality; I was quite amazed at how good the episodes looked. Audio wise it's pretty basic but very serviceable and there are a few noteworthy extras included as well; best of which is a an episode from director Curtis ""A Darkness at Blaisedon"" from an anthology series in the late sixties to early seventies.",1361232000,,1212,4.601851851851852
629537,5,6303320589,I grew up in Brooksville. The doctors office in the movie was my wife's OB/GYN office! Can't think of anything else to write on this review. I should not have to come up with a certain amount of works to say something is great!,1353888000,,227,4.181818181818182
629538,5,6303320589,"If I remember correctly, this was a made for tv movie that I remember seeing off and on over the years and now I have it in my collection at last.

Everything was as described and the DVD arrived in a very timely manner. A very good seller and I'll use them again in the future",1338854400,,277,3.9464285714285716
629539,5,6303320589,"Many years ago I was channel surfing and caught the part of this movie on a UHF channel.

  Yes...for all of you that know what a UHF channel is, it was that long ago.

  Fortunately,  I was able to catch the tail end of one of the other stories and the last story, ""Bobby"".  As much as I love a good horror story I have to say this one really gave me a bad case of the creeps (in a good way).  So much so that over 15 years later, even though I never saw it on TV again I would tell other folks about ""Bobby"" and they would be on the edge of their seats just by me telling the story from what I could remember even though I don't consider myself a good story teller.  My biggest problem was I did not know the name of the anthology it came from, only some of the actors that was in it.  For a while I wondered if I really saw this story or was it just a very vivd nightmare.

  Well thanks to IMDB.com and Amazon.com I was finally able to locate this title after a very very long search (many years) and I have to say it still has it's scare appeal after all these years even without all the high tech effects of today.  (Keep in mind that this film came out in 1977)

  So if you like your 70`s nostalgia mixed with chill and thrills you gotta get this one along with ""Triolgy of Terror"" starring Karen Black and features the story about the Zuni warrior doll named ""He Who Kills"".  That's another story that folks still remember after all these years.",1329004800,3,1454,4.020979020979021

629541,5,6303320589,"Today people think horror has to be nothing but blood and gore
and sex with boys and girls running around with mad axe men in
mask or other ridiculous costumes with no story! Dead of Night
was made by the great Dan Curtis who could make a horror story
and not show ounce of blood and scare the pants off you! of course
you have to have an attention span and watch and listen to the
story! This trilogy of three stories are well written acted and
directed. I remember these as a kid and the last one scared me
I didn't want to turn the lights out! If you like Dan Curtis or
Night Stalker TV series with Darren McGavin [a must have] or
the best Dracula movie ever made with Jack Palance [a must have]
then you will like these classic horror stories. I bought these
as bootleg years ago so I can't comment on the disc set quality.",1309651200,,827,4.142857142857143
629542,5,6303320589,"While there's so much to love about TV-horror from the 1970s, such as Rod Serling's NIGHT GALLERY, Dan Curtis remains the king of made-for-TV terror! His NIGHT STALKER, NIGHT STRANGLER, and TRILOGY OF TERROR are all classics. Not to mention his original DARK SHADOWS! In DEAD OF NIGHT, Curtis uses the same basic formula that he utilized so effectively in TRILOGY OF TERROR. He starts us out w/ a tame, time-traveling ""what if?"" story in SECOND CHANCE (starring Ed Begley, jr.), dials the tension up a notch w/ the twisty Gothic, NO SUCH THING AS VAMPIRES (w/ Patrick MacNee and Elisha Cook), and delivers the shivery goods w/ the demonically frightening, BOBBY (w/ Joan Hackett and Lee Montgomery)! Though all three parts are quite watchable, it is BOBBY that has haunted me for these last 34 years! Highest recommendation...",1295913600,,826,4.9496402877697845
629543,5,6303320589,"I saw this trilogy when it first aired, probably on ABC, in 1977 when I was thirteen.  I can't review the first two stories because I simply don't remember them.  I think Mr. Curtis intentionally stuck the last story, ""Bobby"" at the end of the trilogy, and for good reason.  It scared the hell out of a generation!  I'm 45 now and cynical and jaded, but I just don't think I have the guts to purchase ""Dead of Night"" on Amazon.

629544,5,6303320589,"This film is all about Bobby, period. When I first saw this short story on TV, I was just a kid and I was haunted by it. While the rest of the movie is mediocre at best, Bobby is brilliant. I was very happy to find this classic restored on High Quality DVD9 with great menus and extras.",1240531200,8,286,3.9482758620689653
629545,5,6303320589,"Before ""Dead of Night"" Dan Curtis did a three story anthology show called ""Trilogy of Terror."" It starred Karen Black; the first two segments were so-so; the third was unforgettable. The story entitled ""Amelia"" featured the Zuni fetish doll called ""He Who Kills""; it was one of the greatest moments of horror, on tv or elsewhere.

And so it is with ""Dead of Night."" The first two stories are average. The third is a knockout. I remember seeing it when it first came on; I never forgot the final piece entitled ""Bobby."" Joan Hackett and Lee Montgomery are excellent. I won't reveal the story; it's best not to know what happens. All I'll say is that the segment is terrifying and features an ending that packs a wallop. Really, it was one of the most shocking, frightening things I've ever seen. And after it ends the credits roll over a background of total darkness, with the eerie sound of crickets making it seem even more foreboding.

This deserves five stars for ""Bobby"" alone. Dan Curtis at his best was a master of horror.",1237248000,22,1028,4.612021857923497
629546,3,6303320589,"Dead of Night is a anthology TV movie (3 short horror stories) by Dan Curtis who gave us Trilogy of Terror. I thought it was pretty good with the last story Bobby being the most memorable. This same story came back in Trilogy of Terror part 2. Bobby is a boy brought back to life by his mother through some witchcraft but it really isn't Bobby. What this creature looks like at the finale will scare the crap out of you. What a face..
The 2nd story No Such Thing as a Vampire has a woman thinking she is getting bit by a vampire - her husband gets a man who specializes in vampires to stop the horror. If I say any more it would ruin the twists and turns of what is going on. I will say Elisha Cook Jr is in this - for those that remember him from many classic Noir and mysteries like The Maltese Falcon
The first story with Ed Begley Jr. - he buys a car from 1926 and suddenly finds himself in that very year. Again, I don't like to spoil anything for those wanting to see this, but I will say this was the weakest of the 3, at least to me.
Dark Sky presents this DVD in its original full frame and the transfer is a nice sharp image for the most part. There are still some grainy or hazy parts here and there, the night scenes in Bobby - I think there was just a little too much black, still a little dark in some places.but nothing really bad...
If you like Trilogy of Terror you will most likely enjoy this as well, Bobby is the winner here, and is almost as good as the Zuni misfit doll from Trilogy of Terror.",1233273600,8,1515,4.0198675496688745

I'm a die-hard horror fan; I especially love older horror movies (70s, 80s, 90s) and trilogies are favorites too. I enjoyed this as a 70s trilogy but absolutely do not see why all the rave reviews about how ""creepy"" the Bobby story is.  Maybe for folks who saw it back then as kids, but being my first time seeing it at age 55, nah.  It was definitely worth it to find another Lee Montgomery movie, though, and I did enjoy it.

 I actually liked the first story the best.  The second one about the vampires was horribly acted and predictable.  The woman in the third story (Bobby) was annoying as hell.
