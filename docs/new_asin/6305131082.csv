973208,5,6305131082,"I just can't believe people can actually give this classic a 1 star. Probably still IS the most violent anime or even movie created. Amazing characters like Raoh, Jagi, Rey just to name a few. Action, romance,  uuh...action. The more I watch this movie the more I like it! It's still  amazing to me that this movie was done in 1986! Don't be fooled by the 1996  B-movie version.",953510400,,378,4.449275362318841
973209,3,6305131082,"Good movie, but I think a lot was lost in the dubbing. The dubbing makes the movie seem rather silly, whereas it was probably intended to be serious.  A must-see if you like animated violence.
I don't think it  takes the cake for worst dub ever. The new Dragonball Z episodes from  Funimation are much, much worse.",946857600,,314,4.473684210526316
973210,5,6305131082,"As you have probably seen, there are many reviews with completely different opinions on this movie. The reason that there are people who hate this and people who love it is simple: You'll love it if you appreciate  anime style in general. Everything is pulled off with style. The  translation may be messed up and some plotholes are left, but what are you  going to do? There is no subtitled version, but at least the English voices  aren't completely atrocious. The original soundtrack is left in, as well.  The graphics are starting to show its age, but that didn't bother me. The  overall execution of the movie is what drew me in.",945648000,,634,4.616071428571429
973211,1,6305131082,"Although Carl Macek often gets credited with a lot for this film, he was not the writer of this atrocious non-translation. He was so deluded about it that he told me and a friend of mine that it was a straight translation.  Not even the title is a translation. Hokuto no Ken means Fist of Ursa Major  (The Great Bear). ""Fist of the North Star"" was a translation  error from the initial article in the C/FO (the original international  anime fan club) magazine. I was never a huge fan of the television series  that preceded this film (and the Japanese, Hong Kong, and American live  action versions), but I respected the work. When I spoke with a  representative from Toei at the NATPE convention, I could tell it was one  of their flagship titles. They got an award for the television series for  doing an adaption that was very true to the original comic book series by  ""Bronson"" and Tetsuo Hara. The television series is now offered  in dubbed and subtitled form. This film version, however, is perhaps the  worst translation and one of the worst dubs of all time. They replaced  Ken's low, soft monotone with a revoltingly peppy American DJ-style voice.  None of the principles behind Hokutoo Shin Ken are retained. In a scene  where Ken growls the name ""Jagi"" and smashes a statue of him in  the original, the cheese dub has him saying, ""It's a good likeness,  but it's not The Fist of the North Star."" It was embarrassing to see  in the theatre. Crowds of college students got the cheeseball kung fu movie  they were looking for, apparently, and howled with laughter. In one scene  Ken tells Lynn ""This might hurt a little..."" leaving the audience  to think the worst. The film had to top the television series in Japan,  which was already way over the top when it comes to violence, so this film  already had super-powered scenes far beyond belief. The addition of  ridiculous dialog didn't help matters at all. This could indeed be the  worst dub of all time.",940032000,6,1968,4.6023054755043225
973314,1,6305131082,"FIST OF THE NORTH STAR: THE MOVIE is simply awful. The storyline is lacking in any coherency or nuance, the characters are all mono dimensional and uninteresting, and the presentation is turgid. Taking a 100-episode series and trying to squash it all into a two-hour movie (never a wise decision when adapting any such lengthy source material) may be part of the problem. But the major issue with FIST OF THE NORTH STAR is that it is, simply put, not at all interesting. It's basically scene after scene of blood-splattering violence, with few breaks in the action, and a virtually nonexistent plot. Characters come in and out at various times, over cluttering an already busy movie. We are never given a specific reason to care about anybody in one way or another because of that. The end result is a boring, and frankly, not very compelling train wreck that doesn't make any sense. Apparently there are two different endings to this movie, but because the movie provides very little reason to care one way or another, it's hard to know WHAT could have made it any better. The English dub, provided by Streamline Pictures, is even worse; a dreadfully wooden, robotic, stiff, and all around boring train wreck with disappointingly underwhelming turns from everyone involved, despite the presence of names like Michael McConnohie and Greg Snegoff. In fact, it gets my vote for being one of the worst dubs of all time. Carl Macek and company have done so much better. I've ripped into this movie long enough for you to get the idea. There are far superior animated movies to invest in than this joyless, unpleasant film.",1465084800,,1618,4.823741007194244

973316,5,6305131082,"I was blown away by this transfer. My rating is from the perspective of someone that already loves this film and has watched it numerous times since 1989. I saw this at the Neptune Theater in Seattle in 1989. I owned the VHS and initial DVD releases. This newer DVD looks and sounds better than any version I have seen. I'm watching it on a 50 inch plasma with 5.1 surround, and loving it. I appreciate that the Streamline dub is present, because that was my first exposure to Fist of the North Star, but I'm also very glad the literal subtitles are included too. Bottom line: if you love this movie, get this version. And if you don't love this movie, you just don't appreciate exploding heads.",1461715200,6,695,4.4375

973373,5,6305131082,"I remember seeing this movie on VHS courtesy of a friend of mine from work sometime in the early to mid '90s. To this day, the title "" Fist of the North Star"" is synonymous with being the most brutally wicked violent F'n badass animated movie ever made!!! Twenty + years later, and I still got shivers down my spine at just the mere thought of getting my own DVD copy of this classic anime! Now I'm not gonna lie to the readers of this review by saying that I am a diehard fan who knows all the dialogue by heart and can name all the characters & their respective powers and philosophies. The point I am attempting to make here is that even after over 20 years I still remember how incredible and how incredibly excited & impressed I was with this movie. Long story short, it stood and will continue to stand the test of time in the underappreciated genre known as anime. I'm tempted to say it is the best ever of its class, but I'm going to hold off on that until I see some of the other anime greats, such as Akira, Vampire Hunter D and Grappler Baki just to name a few. But if you're new to anime & want to start off with a sure-fire winner of a flick, Fist of the North Star is the perfect choice! It's the kind of movie that you talk about several days after seeing it. In closing, I love pretty much everything about the '80s including music & movies...this film certainly ranks as one of the best things about the 1980s, and is a genuine classic...Do yourself a big favor and watch it.

I believe this to be a shot for shot remake.  If you were to take screen shots of the exact same moment in the two versions, you would see that this dvd is much different.  I think realmccoy51 answered my question.  If the original reels of this film were lost in a fire then there probably wasn't anything to make dvds from.  Hence the shot for shot remake.

As far as the rest of the movie series go, even the Tales of the Dark King limited series, this one just didn't compare.  It wasn't a horrible movie, but after seeing the all out action in the first movie from years ago, and knowing what Raoh and Thouzer did, and how they went about their things, this one was just weak.  It didn't even cap off the run very well.  If it had been a stand alone movie, I would have enjoyed it better I think; the animation and artwork were well done, and the voice acting was good, it just seemed to lack a story.  Heck, New Fist of the North Star was better than this one.

973554,5,6305131082,"Fist of the North Star is one of the most revered and celebrated manga and anime series of all time. It's story is deep, with it's own unique and intriguing martial arts mythos, and the action is violent and satisfying.

The movie is basically a retelling of most of the mangas key scenes and battles, taking liberties when needed to make the story flow more smoothly. If you are not familiar with the series, the story follows Kenshiro, a martial artist of Hokuto Shinken, the Fist of the North Star. He goes on a quest for vengeance after his beloved Yulia is taken from him by Lord Shin. On his quest he meets friendly allies such as Bat, Lin, and Rei and faces off against his most deadly foes such as Jagi, Shin, and ultimately the Dark Lord Raoh. The action is intense and the gore excessive, but it's always what Fist of the North Star does best.

Let me clear up one thing about the movie that has caused a lot of confusion ever since its American release. The reason for the awful looking, some call them monochromatic, death scenes is because they were meant to be viewed with 3D glasses. On the VHS version of the movie, if you have the red/blue 3D glasses it looks fine, but it doesn't seem as effective on the DVD release. Why these scenes were not at least fixed or restored, or even given the option to switch on and off for the DVD release is beyond me. Also, the 3D aspect is never advertised on ANY home video release I have ever seen, making viewing these scenes the first time rather awkward. Still, it's a great movie if you can manage to locate a copy.",1331510400,,1574,4.350340136054422

With a grand total of three body types in play (child, inconceivably muscular and, in just one instance, morbidly obese) there's clearly a distinct appearance that's best suited for surviving an apocalypse, and on the surface it would appear that we're walking into a series of evenly-matched competitions. But that's when the Dragon Ball Z-styled aural superpowers kick in, and the mass of limbs begin their lazy, bloody, individual arcs through the sky. There's very little substance to this story - really, it's just a nonstop barrage of enemies against differing backdrops a'la the fighting games of the mid '90s - so it's good news that the battles are at least viscerally entertaining.

Why do a new transfer (assumbly uncensored) and then take parts from the old low quality analog masters and re-insert them? From what I can see the censorship was indeed delibrate.

My biggest concern with this version was: is it as violent as the releases I saw in the original release? I would say it's probably the closest one there is to an original.  @ This point the thing I am most happy about this copy besides the video clarity and REALLY great remastered sound is the original Japanese voiceover and score.  This with the English subtitles almost makes it another movie and can be appreciated as the Japanese would have proposed it.  If you are a fan of this movie I would suggest you pick up this copy..

973593,3,6305131082,"I was first introduced to the FOTNS universe by the Dark Kings anime and I liked it very much and wanted to see more. I did some research and saw that this movie covered the entire 1st FOTNS series before the time skip. I figured I could just buy this to save me from watching 100 episodes, because this was supposedly an abridged version.

First of all, this is an adaptation, pure and simple. Not an abridged retelling as done with the Gundam movies. The creators had to make some major changes to fit the story into 2 hrs. But I'll get to that later.

Watching this movie before the series was a decent experience. I got to see some bloody fights. Other than that it was very confusing. The story jumps around a lot and most things aren't explained well. I certainly wasn't blown away by it. A mediocre martial arts flick.

I felt after watching the mediocre movie that I should still give the series a chance. I thought it would be mindless, violent, bloody fun. Boy was I wrong. The series, while sporting dated animation, was amazing. The first arc does drag, and is repetitive, but stick with it. Trust me. There truly is no other show quite like it.

After watching the series, this movie was washed from my mind. Watching it a second time was very different. I was excited to see better artwork and animation of my now beloved characters. Also, there were some seriously awesome moments. For instance when Ken has a beard and is just walking as buildings fall on him and he doesn't even flinch...

The story however, was pretty jarring. Many big characters are nonexistant. People fight who never fought in the series. Many events happen out of order. While I appreciate the clever plot devices used to make this movie shorter and fresh, I feel it lost its soul. The movie loses the concept of pressure point fighting and the bonds between characters are almost non-existant. By the end credits I was like....ok...

This movie is the main reason that FOTNS is popular in the U.S. at all. In fact it helped pioneer anime in the us alongside classics like Akira. Unfortunately, people will probably judge it as a shallow fighter after watching this, or the repetitive 1st arc of the series. Watch the entire series. Like DBZ, only deep and for adults.",1295654400,3,2258,4.576732673267327

973597,5,6305131082,I have the older dvd and had the vhs they were the exact same.  Here is what i did however there have been many side stories and stuff.  You want to know the legend of Hoktino Ken [...]  There it is 4 box sets of the japanese cartoon and the movie.  I got the set and all the other movies on my own.  I would like to just check out this version but my thing is it seems exactly the same from what i read.  Kind of like when Akria got bought out and redid the script so it sucked.  I have the original Akira on vhs transfered to dvd. So whats the differance between this and the older dvd.  Well The first dvd was just like the vhs and this version is the same thing other then some scenes have more color to them like extra shades of some color or more vibrant aruas may have 2 colors now.  So not big deal and the other thing the sound was exactly the same i read another review that said it was better if have 5.1 and i didn't hear a differance but could be few reasons.  Yea so 14 bucks for extra color not really worth it.  But being the fan that i am i got it because i had to see for myself i heard they added extra to it.  But nobody could tell me what or how exactly.  So i just told everybody what it is not worth it if you have the original. Oh i think some japanese was added in the begining i am not sure it was there in the first one.,1281225600,,1347,3.802158273381295

I hate censored films, and I despise those who do the censorship. It angers me like none other, especially when this goddamn dvd is the only available print of this movie out there anymore!

973600,4,6305131082,"Probably one of the most bareknuckle post-apocalyptic movies ever was Hokuto No Ken, or as it was known in America, Fist Of The North Star. This retelling of the manga which at the same time was a 109-episode anime TV series achieved cult status in the States when it was first released on dub-only VHS(and very briefly on DVD)through Streamline Pictures, and then recently on bilingual DVD from Discotek Media. It even spawned off a horrendous American live-action movie that makes Dragonball: Evolution seem almost watchable.

After a nuclear war decimates most of the entire planet, the buff-as-Hell Kenshiro(or usually just ""Ken"")is the prize student of an elite martial arts dojo, each student of which is given a distinct titles. Ken is the Fist of the North Star, which his other brothers want to take away the role of. Shin, the South Star, nearly fataly wounds Ken and takes away his lover Yuria. Ken emerges a year later even stronger than before, and teams up with another martial artist to take on his other brother Jagi. Jagi is now masquerading as the new Fist of the North Star, so Ken blows his head up with his awesome wa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da attack(""You're already dead!). Ken finds out from Jagi just before his head a'splodes that Yuria is with Shin in his stronghold in the south. Meanwhile, Ken's stronger brother Raoh has been gathering an army of extraordianary magnitude, and conquering road warrior-wannabes left and right. Raoh sets his sights on Shin's little empire. After pounding the crap out of his fortress, Raoh makes off with Yuria to lure Ken out. Ken goes after them to Raoh's capital, and he and Roah thrown down in an epic fight the likes of which Dragonball or Street Fighter still haven't been able to match. Raoh leaves Ken after gaining some last minute bit of conscious from an orphen girl, and Ken then pursues Yuria who for no explained reason left on her own. The movie has a strange Waterworld-type ending where Ken thinks he's found an oasis that Yuria has sewn, but it turns out to be an illusion.

This movie has achieved a status with even non-otaku on the level of other anime movies like Akira and Ghost In The Shell. The film has that amazing but still gritty 80s brand of animation. There is some serious gore and violence in it, so fans of Quinten Tarantino will totally gush over it. Admittedly the dub is pretty stale, even for one directed by Carl Macek(history's greatest monster!), but if you developed enough of a resistance to his crap from watching Robotech then this shouldn't be too much of a stretch. It is more of an action film then anything else, so guys, just send your ladies to the mall and watch this sandwiched in between Die Hard and Commando!",1264809600,,2720,4.736286919831223

Some people are trying to bring it back to life and some mutant giant warriors hellbent on killing people, a martial artist named Ken has been murdered by a friend of his named Shin who takes his woman and leaves him to be dead, later on he becomes magically resurrected with magicial martial arts powers that can make bad people explode through fist-fights. He battles many vicious mutants including Shin and his two brothers Raoh and Jagi as he fights to get back his love and even save the world from being dead.

Bone-crunching and ultaviolent Japanese animated Sci-fi fantasy action flick is one of the best cult animated movies ever. Directed by Vampire Hunter D's Toyoo Ashida this is an all-out assault on the viewer's senses and kicks you in the gut. The film has an interesting eco-future story and about humanity, there's also loads of graphic gory violence including exploding heads and bodies galore. The battle and action sequences are nothing sort of outstanding including the animation which seems to be an improvement over Ashida's ""Vampire Hunter D"" whom the character does make a brief cameo. This one isn't for the weak stomached but for those that like action, Sci-fi and animation i recommend this movie.

In this release:
* The film is digitally restored. It actually looks a little better than the original release.
* The movie still goes into monochromatic mode during the most violent scenes - just like in all previous US releases.
* The original US dub (Streamline) is used. The original Japanese audio is also included.
* There are also two sets of subtitles, one for the US dub dialog and one that is a faithful translation of the Japanese dialog. Before reading the Japanese subtitles, I never realized how many liberties Streamline took with the script. It's almost like watching a different movie!
* The Japanese theatrical ending is used, which is the same ending all previous US releases had. (There is a Japanese home-video ending where Ken and Raoh's duel ends in a draw)
* We get the Japanese theatrical teasers & trailers.
* The 80's hair-metal song ""Heart of Madness"" is liberally applied in the menus.

Again, this is probably the best release of this film in the US. If you need to replace your decade-old copy of the VHS tape, this is your best choice.",1246147200,54,1276,4.6415929203539825
973675,3,6305131082,"First, let's get the good out of the way.  The picture quality on this disc is absolutely fantastic.  After watching VHS copies and fan-subbed digital versions for years, it's truly eye-opening to see Hokuto no Ken looking like this.  Everything looks incredibly clean.  Sound is also quite good, so the A/V package is right on.

But, let's get to the bad.  Extras are pretty much nil, except for some trailers (which are thankfully also up to the same quality as the feature), a bios section for the characters and a gallery.  There are quite a few spelling errors, mostly with the way things are romanized from the Japanese text, and mis-translations in the English subs for the Japanese track (there are also subs for the English voice track, too).  A lot of these are very irksome when you are used to translations that have been used for a long time and used by other folk that are a lot more fluent than I am.  And shame on Toei for not bothering to uncensor the more graphic kills in the movie.  Not only is it just lazy on their part, but it also throws off the movie by switching from the great picture quality of the rest of the film to the grainy, low-quality censored stuff.  This may have caused some PTA folks in Japan to blow their tops in '86, but it's now 23 years later.  Give us an uncut print.

It's nice to see this get a decent DVD release, but it's certainly not worth $30.  Pick it up if it falls under $20; that's what I'm waiting to do.",1245974400,13,1462,4.3468634686346865
973676,5,6305131082,"This is a must for any fan or collector of anime.  For years this was a gem that could only be found on VHS.  Now on DVD the quality is much better.  Much better than the series, this is the original story that led to a multi-episode series, a NES Game and an actual live-action movie.  A classic that stands in the same category as Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D, Grappler Baki (The movie is also better than the series) and Crying Freeman, this DVD release is the final piece to that collective of great anime.

Set in a post-apocalyptic setting where money is valueless and food and supplies are priceless, the story follows the hero Kenshiro and his journey of struggle and betrayal as he rises to reclaim his status of the true Fist of the North Star.  Shin, his former best friend and also Fist of the South Star, attacks Ken to seize his love Julia.  The plot thickens as it is revealed that Ken's own brother Jaggy is the spark that turned Shin's admiration of Julia to the fire and madness that is the cause of the assault.

At the same time Ken's oldest brother Raoh has decided that the title of the Fist of the North Star should be his because of his immense power and the fact that Ken's seems to have been destroyed by Shin.  Raoh unveils his feelings to their master Ryuken, who does not agree and tells him to leave and never return.  Though it is not shown, Raoh erupts and in fact kills Ryukens and begins his mission of total domination.

The movie definitly has an 80's vibe with both the effects and the music.  While most anime fans I know appreciate this movie for the gem that it is some view it as choppy and even corny.  I believe this is one of the few anime movies you can find that has a good story with intriguing characters and the old school, raw anime of that represented the time it was made.

This is and Ninja Scroll were what we automatically envisioned whenever the term ""Japanese Animation"" came about.  A true classic.",1245110400,18,1958,4.370165745856354

973678,4,6305131082,"Fist of the North Star is near and dear to the heart of my geekdom, I grew up watching this movie on VHS almost every day. For those of you that aren't familiar with this, this movie is a compressed version of the first Hokuto No Ken (Fist of the North Star) tv series. The movie is incredibly violent, Ninja Scroll is tame compared to this! The voice acting is great, those of you who have seen Vampire Hunter D (also directed by Toyoo Ashida) will recognize a few voices. The music is great, and SO 1986, rad. The animation is some of my favorite, it's not gorgeous like Ninja Scroll or Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust but this was 22 years ago. Toyoo Ashida has a certain way with gore, nobody makes exploding heads or loose body parts look as good as he did. The story is set in a ruined earth circa 199X (don't ask, it's from the show) after armageddon was brought on by mankind's own stupid hands. In this world money is meaningless, there is no government, no rules, no mercy. Only the strong survive, and many of those that do survive eventually meet their sticky end at the hands (fists) of our hero, Ken. The story leaves many things out to jam it all into a movie, but it doesn't really suffer for it. If you like action and violent anime, this is totally for you. Now, on to my only real gripe with this version. This is a 22 year old film and it hasn't been remastered at all, the colors are a bit off in places and everything is WAY too dark. It's not like it's unwatchable or anything, but it definitely makes me wish I still had my VHS copy. Anyone who has seen the DVD release of the original Vampire Hunter D should know what to expect. All in all, this is still one of the best Animes ever, seriously ground-breaking stuff when you compare this to what else was around in 86. Can't beat the price, I'm sure the insanely hard to find and ungodly expensive American release on DVD is better, but you'd have to be crazy to shell out $80 or more for a copy of this.",1230854400,2,1976,4.23015873015873

973736,5,6305131082,"This post apocalyptic story is amazing and like the reviewer above, was the first Anime I had ever seen and what got me into them in the first place.

First off, Kenshiro is an awesome character.  He is tough as nails, goes through the villains in the story like a knife through butter, but is full of wisdom while still managing to entertain with his tag line, ""You're already dead!"".

The story, in a shorthand, mankind uses nuclear power to destroy ourselves on our own planet.  The remaining people are in a constant struggle where money and such has no value, yet food and water are better than gold.  The world now is in a scarred and dying state, and the people who remain are in a constant state of ""The weak will die and the strong shall survive and take from the weak.""

Ken, who was betrayed by his best friend, left for dead and his love Julia taken from him, is thrown off a cliff and thought to be dead.

A girl who is a mute thanks to watching her family get burned alive, summons Ken through a link she has with him and he brings hell to his enemies.  That is just a shorthand of the plot not to spoil it for those who want to see it.  Plus, you can read above more about the story if you so desire.

It is VERY gory, lots of limbs getting ripped off, eyeballs flying, heads exploding, and blood that rains down all over the place.  But, even with the fairly familiar plot (ala Mad Max) and the violence, the film manages to capture not only human weaknesses and strengths, it also captures a believable new world where constant remains of the world are seen.  In one seen, a group of thugs kill a group of people who are traveling, and you see them stealing the food and water and throwing the money and jewelery aside, showing that they are no longer valuable unlike the world of today.  The extremely violent scenes are shown in a bright, blurry fashion, which a lot of people complain about, but you still know what happens and you can still see it.  I think the creators did this for two reasons, one because it's violent enough, and two because the deaths are supposed to be symbolic not a gore showcase.  Probably it's both!

The animation quality is pretty good, seen better and much worse.  The fight scenes can range from great, to short, to just plain hilarious.  But, Ken is an awesome character and you would not want to be one of those who are against him.  This is a must see, whether you are a fan of the comics, the original TV series, or the newer series.

The bad parts are some of the cheesy lines, and most importantly the end.  It's a big cliff hanger, it just shows Ken walking around trying to find Julia all over the world while he keeps imagining glimpses of her picking apples from a tree and such. The biggest problem is not everything makes sense, especially translated in English.  You miss a big part where Ken goes from being left for dead to where he comes back and is summoned by the little girl.

Could have ended much better but if you like action, gore, or just want to see a great Anime, look no further!",1189641600,6,3058,4.3169877408056045

The anime series (both of them) and the original movie remake can't possibly compare at all with the greatness of the ORION japanimation movie, the whole movie has a point and uses kung-fu and love to make an interesting story about doing what's right in a new dark age of man, eventually giving hope for the fate of a better future.",1139788800,6,963,4.485714285714286

This film is not entirely faithful to the 30 minute cartoons, it does capture the essence of the story line.

It melds together the fear of, and the reality of a nuclear holocaust, with the fantastic feats that were never possible with martial arts.

Fact is, the world would be a much better place if martial artists like Kenshiro actually existed.  Kenshiro represents something truly fictional; kindness towards good but weak people, and extreme cruelty towards strong and bad people.  In the world we live in, particularly in the typical american high school, its the other way around.  Sad thing is, if a martial artist like Kenshiro actually existed and executed his brand of justice on evil people, he would be demonized by the media because the more powerful, fortunate and cruel among us would be threatened by him.  I guess that, despite the fact that the voice acting is terrible, the animation horrible, and the effects downright cheezy, people love this move because Kenshiro represents an impossible ideal.",1074729600,,863,5.049295774647887

Those who disagree has no clue of the story behind this film.
When they see Kenshiro punch a guy in the head and it suddently explodes, they don't know that he actually hits at preassure point in the head,whitch causes this ""mysterious"" head explosion.
Kenshiro uses a deadly martial art named ""Hokuto Shinken"" or Fist Of the North Star whitch uses a person's 708 Keiraku Hikou preassure points. These preassure points destroys a person from the inside.

973799,2,6305131082,"Okay, I have to admit that Fist of the North Star was enternaining to watch, assuming you watch it with friends who can mock the movie with you. But it was really, really bad. First of all the movie was entirely too long, the plot was kind of untineresting and I lost track of who most of the characters were for a while. That didn't really matter though. After a point the movie breaks down... ... All it all this movie is terrible the plot is horrible, the violence is ridculous, and the ending will leave you ranting and screaming ""What the heck was that!"" for hours.",1019520000,,570,4.336448598130841

Of course soon after the speaker of these words, Ken and Raul's father, is murdered by Raul who goes on to gather an army and finish the job the nuclear war started.
Not a deep film in the traditional sense (although you know the anti-nuclear war sentiment was tried here), FOTNS is quite simply 'Road Warrior' on steroids. Everything is amped up to unbelieveable levels, from the violence - you haven't lived until you've seen a man sliced up like so many slices of deli meat - to the corny dialogue. Ken's girlfriend is apparently some sort of post-apocalypitic Johnny Appleseed and seems to be more concerned with the dying Earth than Ken, but that doesn't stop him from nearly giving his life for her twice. Figures.
Although not as understandable as the Japanese OAVs based on the manga of the same name, this film gives Westerners a pretty good idea of what passes for adult animated entertainment over there, and I for one want more on the screen, that is). 'Legend of the Overfiend' was a bit much, but this is no better or worse than some of our bloodfests. Plus it's got cool death scenes.",1006300800,,1136,4.600985221674877
973801,4,6305131082,"This is the only anime that I watch with the English dialogue on.  Why?  Because it's so bad, that it makes the movie a comedy.  I am dead serious.  There have been several occasions where I have had many friends over, and with or without chemical substances, we laugh so hard at this film that we have to pause while we gasp for breath.
I am a huge anime fan, but for me, FOTNS is the anime equivalent of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" or ""The Toxic Avenger"".  It's full of bloody gore, bad dialogue, and people who change their size every time the camera changes angle.  Ships stuck in the buildings are neat!
Serious anime fans (otaku) will hate this film, but if you like cheese you may really have a good time!  I know I keep coming back to FOTSN, like a car crash that I have to watch.",1005004800,2,792,4.2052980132450335
973802,4,6305131082,"This DVD movie is basically a compilation of the first Hokuto No Ken TV series that was aired in the mid 80s in Japan. First time viewers may not understand or know about how the characters came about and the histories these people had in the series. Yes, we are introduced to our protagonist Kenshiro, his ""brothers"" Jagi and Raoh, Nanto Rokuseiken practitioners Shin, Rei, and Julia (Yuria actually), Lynn (the girl), and Bat and some others. We don't get to meet Toki (another of Kenshiro's Hokuto Shinken practicing brothers), the other three Nanto Rokuseiken practitioners (Shu, Yuda, Souther), and some other minor supporting characters. Several of the reviews don't give this DVD a fair shake and I can see that considering the quality of animation and the dubbing that was done. I agree that the animation is not top notch compared to today's standards, but what stands out to me is the story itself. Kenshiro is a guy who dearly loves this girl, but is betrayed by a former friend and his own brothers. He then steps out into this post apocalyptic world to find her and to live in peace with her. In the meantime, his brothers who want to be known as the ""official"" Hokuto Shinken successor are trying to kill him and he also has to deal with his once good friend Shin. There are several human qualities that come out in this film: loyalty, honor, courage, forgiveness, integrity, and love. Kenshiro doesn't hurt or kill people just for the sake of killing them. Only those who deserve it. If you ever get a chance to watch the TV series, you'll be won over like I did and can perhaps watch this film with more appreciation than the casual anime viewer. You'll be wondering why the ending in this film is not like how it ended in the TV series!",981072000,9,1753,4.585987261146497

Next, ya gotta like serious people and real violence (none of that Dragon Half/Bugs  Bunny-like cartoony violence where no one dies and everyone's eyes turn  into swirling circles). You into serious anime? OK, now here's where Fist  of the North Star turns the corner - how graphic and gory do you like your  deaths? Fist of the North Star is a good anime in a post-apocalyptic world  where a person of super human strength escorts a mute girl in a war against  huge armies conqueoring huge nations (it's an epic).
But where's it  different from the others is that the main character's (the Fist of the  North Star) special attack is that, when he punches you, your innards try  to find ways to escape your body, causing you to explode in a pool of  intestines and livers and stuff. While all the other guys do standard anime  things like punching, kicking and so forth (well, the main bad guy actually  sticks his fingers in you, making big gory holes, but the rest of the  people are normal), the main guy causes really gross explosions. i don't  know what it is with Japanese people and biomass, but with the large  absorbing flesh monster at the end of Akira and the multi-body demon in  Devil Man and the explosions in Fist of the North Star, i think someone has  a real internal organs fetish.

Hailed as amazingly violent, the film centres on the man who can save humanity from the clutches of an evil  emperor. The pace of the film is good, as are the overall action sequences.  Like Vampire Hunter D the animation has suffered considering that it is  over 10 years old.  The music is fair and the dubbing is competent. The  best live action film to compare this to is a more violent Mad Max. The DVD  enhances the overall quality of the film. This still remains as one of the  best early animes. It is stylish and is not afraid to show scenes of  extreme violence. Thus it is highly recommended.",954374400,3,716,4.291044776119403

7883980,5,6305131082,"The first time I saw this movie I was absolutely blown away by it. I remember looking through the anime rack, and there this movie was. It had a sticker on it saying, ""not for kids."" That grabbed my attention quick. The cover says the most violent movie ever, sweet!! I bought it, and was hooked, on just the opening sequence of the apocalypse. However, mind you, that this movie is a brief overview of the first 3 volumes of the TV series, and even this movie is not true to the TV series in places, such as with the Fang Clan fighting Raou's Clan.

Ken wanders the land to bring peace to the violent world, as a chosen savior. In the beginning, Shin and Jagi (his best friend, and younger brother) betray Kenshiro, and leave him for dead. He is awoken from the depths of hell, and comes back stronger then ever, and not only brings peace to the lands he comes across, but brings honor back to his sacred martial arts style.

Visually this movie is very impressive with lots of fighting, blood, and gore. Do not watch if you are meek. It is extremely violent. The music also compliments this movie, and is done very well.

Unfortunately, the movie leaves you with more questions in the end, like what happened to Julia? If you want to know, you need to watch the complete TV series, and that includes Volume 4.
