8743271,4,B018WQBNCW,"I don't know if this is a weird thing to complain about, but we've already had one DVD dedicated to Rainbow Dash. (""A Dash Of Awesome"") And it looks like later this month we'll be getting another ""scary episode"" My Little Pony DVD, when we've already had one of those as well. (""Spooktacular Pony Tales""). We still have three members of the Mane Six that to date have never gotten a DVD dedicated to them. (Rarity, Fluttershy and Applejack.) There's also Spike, who it could be argued is as much a central character to the overall series as any of the six main ponies. You could also make a DVD of Discord episodes, or the new character Starlight Glimmer. So why is the Shout Factory recycling already-used themes?

Regardless, the selection of episodes should please most fans. We have the following:

GRIFFON THE BRUSH-OFF (from Season 1)
Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie are having lots of fun playing harmless, good-natured pranks on their friends, but then an old friend of Rainbow Dash's, a griffon named Gilda, comes to Ponyville, and she wants some alone time with Rainbow Dash. When Pinkie tries to hang out with them, Gilda gets angry and yells at Pinkie. Pinkie quickly becomes convinced that Gilda is rotten to the core, but can she convince everyone else?

HURRICANE FLUTTERSHY (Season 2)
The pegasai are getting ready to create their annual tornado to suck water up from a lake to bring it to Cloudsdale, but Fluttershy wants nothing to do with this, since she has self-confidence problems, especially when it comes to her flight abilities. Rainbow Dash insists she participate, since it's necessary for all the pegasai to work together to make a strong enough tornado, but Fluttershy still doesn't want to do it, especially since she was picked on for being a weak flyer as a child. Will Fluttershy be able to overcome her self-doubts and help her friends?

TESTING, TESTING, 1, 2, 3 (Season 4)
Rainbow Dash has to pass a test on the history of the Wonderbolts in order to join the Wonderbolts Reserve, but she doesn't know any of it. Twilight tries to tutor her, but none of it sinks in. Rainbow Dash's other friends try to help, but none of their different methods seem to work. Will Rainbow Dash find a studying method that works for her so she can pass the test and join the Reserve?

Then we have two episodes from Season 6, ""On Your Marks"" and ""Newbie Dash"". Sadly, I am unable to give descriptions of either of them, as I have not yet seen any of Season 6. In any event, these are the episodes featured here, so enjoy!",1470096000,3,2535,4.624444444444444

8743274,4,B018WQBNCW,"Thank you Shout Factory for sending us this DVD to review!

This one hour and ten minute DVD contains five episodes that focus on keeping and restoring friendships.  Heres a rundown of what each episode is about:

Make New Friends but Keep Discord  Fluttershy and Discord are unlikely friends since Discord is the ruler of chaos.  During one of their tea parties, Fluttershy mentions that shes been invited to the upcoming Grand Galloping Gala and that shes bringing Tree Hugger as her guest.  As the name suggests, Tree Hugger is very in-tune with nature and maintaining her chakra.  Discord is greatly offended and is jealous that some pony is getting between him and his Fluttershy.  Hell have to keep his feelings in check and communicate with Fluttershy before things get out of hand at the Gala.

Slice of Life (100th episode)  Cranky and Matilda are a couple of donkeys in love and planning to get married.  Their only problem is that their wedding invitations that were sent out to everyone had the wrong date on them!  While scrambling to reschedule everything, their village is attacked by a bugbear.  Steve, an effeminate dragon hair dresser gives Matilda advice by telling her that it's not the marriage that's important, but the ceremony.  What?!!!

Amending Fences  Twilight Sparkle has made many great friends since moving to Ponyville.  The problem is that she has forgotten about her previous friends in Canterlot.  To make matters worse, she left on bad terms with some of them too.  Twilight Sparkle returns to Canterlot to make amends with her friends and seek forgiveness for her previous wrong-doings.

Made in Manehatten  Twilight Sparkle is bored and if thats not bad enough, her friends, Rarity and Applejack are summoned to Manehatten without her.  Their assignment is a tough one as Cocoa is trying to pull off a Mid-Summer Theater Revival with no help from previous volunteers.  Everyone in town is too busy to dedicate some of their time to this wholesome event.  Can Rarity and Applejack pull it off despite the lack of help?

The Mane Attraction  Pinkie Pie booked the number one pop star Countess Coloratura for their music festival.  As it turns out, Applejack was childhood friends with her and nicknamed her Ra-ra.  Countess Coloratura has changed a lot since childhood and her manager puts diva demands on the ponies and threatens to cancel the show if they're not met.  Applejack tries to explain to the Countess Coloratura that shes being used but she doesnt believe her until she sees it with her own eyes.

As always the voice talent and animation is top notch in these shows.  While friendship is the overall theme, there are some elements like the New Age references in this DVD that don't sit well with me.  I have found more wholesome messages and characters in previous DVDs.",1459555200,4,2820,4.8715789473684215
