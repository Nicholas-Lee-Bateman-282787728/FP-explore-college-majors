7953324,5,B00005S6KL,If you love this one check out Eagles Claw & Shaolin Invincible Sticks. Basically most of the same actors but different plot. I love Chang Yu as the Evil Kung Fu master in every film. To me he is the coolest Kung Fu villain of all time! Don Wang had a good run with these series of movies.,1468454400,2,289,4.0

7953326,2,B00005S6KL,"Half of the movie the guy falls into a highly depressive state and doesnt want to fight. He gets beat up the other half. This movie was quite boring and the level of the fighting look mediocre. The fights aren't good and the story line is ok, but how it plays out is just too boring. I wouldnt recommend this one.",1237593600,,313,4.147540983606557
7953327,5,B00005S6KL,"Fatal Needles Fatal Fists is a fun movie that is of the Kung Fu Theater/Black Belt Theater/Shaw Brothers era.  This is one of my favorites of the genre.  Wang Tao is great is his role as Chin Chai/Meng Hu. Chang Yi is once again in his familiar role of evil master which he plays so well.  It is actually hard to recognize him in later films without the wig and sometimes moustache.  Tommy Lee who I believe is also the action director has a great supporting role as Chen Piao, Chang Yi's disciple.  His role is played with such charisma and is a great compliment to his two subbordinate henchman.  The action is great and serves the story.  I really like the movies of this genre that make the characters larger than life, and Fatal Needles Fatal Fists does just that.  It may not have the bodget and production of later Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies, but if you're into this genre, this is a great flick.  The english dubbing has so much character in the voices too.  It's comical sometimes, but not in a bad way.  One item of disappointment is that there used to be scene in the version that was originally broadcast that has Chang Yi's character, Chung Tung, entering the brothel where one of his henchmen says ""This is our master Chung Tung and he's from Mongolia.  he likes everything the Best!  The best food, and the best wine!""  The lady of the house, who was Wang Tao's character's boss for a short while immediately says ""You're welcome, welcome!""  I don't remember much else from this scene, or any other scene from the originally broadcasted version that is missing, but I know that many of these films were not stored, catalogued or archived like most major motion pictures for future release.  I miss this scene because I like how in most of these movies, rather than ordering a chicken or tofu and rice when they walk into a restaurant, most of the guys simply say bring me some food and some wine, or bring me your best food and best wine.  In short, brings back memories but also holds up today on its own too.  If you're expecgting Bruce Lee or a Matrix/Jet Li type of film, that it is not, but you can still like it for what it is and like the more polished films as well.",1183507200,2,2191,4.381188118811881
7953328,3,B00005S6KL,"Pretty okay movie - I must say! The plot was there and pretty easy to follow.  The fighting scenes - not bad at all. There's always a white haired villan in most Kung Fu movies you have to get rid off. Well, this is one of these movies. The last fighting scene could have been much longer though. Come on, you know the last fighting scene is the climax of it all and it has to summarize everything. Overall, I've seen a lot worst.  See my other reviews.  Perhaps you'll know which ones not to waste your time on.",1124928000,3,512,4.151515151515151
7953329,3,B00005S6KL,"FATAL NEEDLES VS. FATAL FISTS (1980) is a worthy effort that marks the fourth collaboration between star Wong Tao and Taiwan-based director Lee Tso Nam, who'd previously teamed for THE HOT, THE COOL AND THE VICIOUS, EAGLE'S CLAW and CHALLENGE OF DEATH. It has fewer fight scenes than usual, but compensates with a stronger storyline and a much more intense performance from Wong Tao.
The plotline may seem familiar to western fans since it takes the standard formula of the gunfighter hanging up his guns until he's inevitably provoked back into action and transposes it to the kung fu genre. Here Wong plays a constable who'd caused the death of his partner in a battle with the notorious Four Devils and, after wandering the countryside drunkenly, takes up a new identity and a new job in a faraway town. He is so committed to nonviolence that he allows himself to be beaten and stabbed and derided as a coward when he refuses to stand up to a group of bandits taking over the town to ensure the security of their opium route. Only one new friend sticks by him through thick and thin and when that friend is brutally beaten, only then does our hero intervene.
The chief villain is played by Chang Yi, also the villain in EAGLE'S CLAW and CHALLENGE OF DEATH, among many other kung fu films of the era. Chang uses the needles of the title in a clever acupuncture-style kung fu maneuver that hero Wong finds tough to beat. Chang's chief henchman is another great kung fu opponent, Tommy Lee (aka Kam Ming), who also directed the fights for this film. Overall, this may not be as consistently imaginative and exciting as the star-director team's earlier collaborations, but it still offers enough good scenes to please even the most jaded kung fu buffs.",1041292800,2,1751,4.688311688311688
