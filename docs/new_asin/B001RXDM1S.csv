3781814,5,B001RXDM1S,"My daughter loves Elmo so I bought her this set, and also Elmo's World One.  These are her favorite CDs to watch.  Well worth it if you want your toddler to disappear for an hour so you can do stuff around the house :o)",1275436800,5,219,3.9545454545454546

3781817,1,B001RXDM1S,I bought this dvd set for my 2 1/2 year old daughter who is obssed with elmo and when I got the 3 dvd box set I only revieved 2 of the 3 dvds. I would be very careful buying any products from 3x5 flag seller. She lied on her description of her product she was selling and then would not give me back my money. I just hope someone else does not have the same problems out of this seller as I did.,1264809600,3,395,3.7142857142857144
3781818,5,B001RXDM1S,"Elmo's World is easy and fun. A 30 months girl whose speaking Korean doesn't ask me what are they talking about. Even though she doesn't speak in English, somehow she understands what the Elmo says. And she can follow Elmo's songs such as sky, mail, family, jump, and school. Because they are all the same tune.",1258156800,,311,4.571428571428571
3781819,5,B001RXDM1S,Elmo is a favorite around here and this set is a big hit.  I usually have at least 5 preschoolers and toddlers running around and they are enjoying this as often as I will let them watch it.,1256256000,,190,4.0
3781820,4,B001RXDM1S,"I am very satisfied with this purchase. Great box set, with fun Elmo episodes to watch. I absolutely love the disc ""Families, Mail, and Bath Time"" very good entertainment, two thumbs up and highly recommended for viewing. Then there's the second disc ""Food, Water, and Exercise"" which is great too. The third disc ""Reach for the Sky"" emphasized on Jumping, Going to School and something else, didn't pay attention anymore because this whole disc is boring. 2 great discs out of 3 makes this box set worth buying. As of this moment I am searching Amazon for more Elmo's World discs to buy, just can't get enough of this cute furry little critter. Elmo, We Love You!",1243987200,15,664,4.683760683760684
3781821,1,B001RXDM1S,Debating whether it's worth the hassle to return. A couple of the DVDs have sound that goes in and out and they stop completely when you play the story and you get an error message that says mode not supported. To make them work you have to play it chapter by chapter. What a pain. Sad that they can't produce something decently enough to not disappoint a child.,1487721600,,362,4.338235294117647

3781824,2,B001RXDM1S,"I had the 1st set so bought this second set. It is similar 15 minute segments of Elmo's world but this set has more issues than first one.  Besides missing out the opening music for each segment which kills like (even if you play 1 movie episode instead of Play All), it comes with a long long and repetitive advertisement at the beginning which can't be skipped and I'm not sure which inconsiderate fool consider that to be a good idea on DVD for 2 year olds.

The good:
Elmo!

The bad:
No opening song except for 1st episode.  Kids love the Elmo opening songs.
Very Long un-skipable advertisement before you can watch the episodes.  Not compatible with 2 year old kids.

p.s.  the advertisement is about kids in 120 learning to count with Sesame Street and then goes on listing county after country in a sentence like ""Kids in Aruba are counting with Sesame Street"" for what seems like 120 countries.",1473811200,2,904,4.54320987654321

3781836,5,B001RXDM1S,"My 2yr old son LOVES Elmo and when we watch Sesame Street he only ever wants to watch the Elmo's World part. I was so excited when I found Elmo's World was sold in a set and had to buy this for Christmas. It's nice that there are 3 DVDs - this way we can have one in the player ready to go downstairs, one upstairs and one to put in rotation.

Each DVD has 3 episodes of Elmo's World. While the content of the shows really holds my son's attention, I was kind of disappointed they only do the theme song at the very beginning of the DVD (before the 1st episode) so there really isn't a smooth transition from one episode to the next. Like the show ends with the song like usual (no credits) and then goes straight to Elmo talking about the next topic. Half the fun is getting to sing the intro so to only get it once for 3 episodes was a little disappointing.

Also, not sure if there is just some weird glitch in the set (and likely an issue with my player) but only 1 of them we can't get the subtitles off. So for all 3 episodes on the 1 DVD, we have to have subtitles the whole time. It's just annoying so we tend not to play that one as much.

Before getting this, my son would just ask for Elmo but now he asks for Elmo's World. Ultimately a fantastic buy and something I know we will continue watching for some time.",1423008000,3,1323,4.022813688212928

3781838,5,B001RXDM1S,This product was perfect! The box was slightly and mean really sightly worn but the dvd boxes were brand new as well as the actual dvd.

3781841,5,B001RXDM1S,"It is a great set that I got for my Elmo loving infant.  With nine episodes of Elmo talking about mail, taking a bath, families, exercise, drinking water, what is in the sky, and more, it us educationally fun for those of all ages.",1402876800,,231,4.25
3781842,1,B001RXDM1S,"Pretty typical Elmo's World DVD.
Unfortunately, the description says 300 min long, but it's only 155 min (3 discs each 50 to 53 minutes). This is very disappointing, and the reason for the 1-star rating. Otherwise, I'd say 4 stars.

As for what it is, my main complaint is that, on a given disc, there's almost no transition between one ~15 min program and another, and you can't set it to play just one. I have the same problem with another Elmo's World dvd from a different series.

Apart from that, a very good DVD.",1398729600,11,518,4.442105263157894

3781850,5,B001RXDM1S,"My kids love Elmo's World. It is so nice to be able to just queue up some Elmo's World instead of fast-forwarding through each episode of Sesame Street just to get to it. Plus since they are DVDs it is easy to rip/convert it to a format that works on our phones, tablets, and Xbox. That way we have it anywhere we go, and we don't have to worry about the kids scratching the discs. I'll be buying some more Elmo DVDs after this one.",1375747200,2,432,4.094117647058823
