8212174,5,B000U61L4I,"Great DVD if you are somewhat technologically challenged but don't like the idea of paying a couple hundred bucks to do something as seemingly simple as hooking up your TV.  When my old TV quit, I decided that it was time to go high definition based on the fact that there isn't much choice in ""old type"" analog TVs.  I also decided to upgrade my old DVD player, too, as it had been acting up -- freezing, etc.  Most of the salesmen I talked to pushed ""HDMI"" connections saying it provided a better picture, but none of them could tell me why or, in most cases, even what it stands for (High Definition Multimedia Interface).  And all of them wanted me to pay to ""install"" the new TV and DVD player. Having had several TVs, VCRs, and a DVD player already, I have never had any of these ""installed"", and saw no reason to start now.  Seemed like a scam to me.  However, after the TV and DVD player were delivered, I was pretty much overwhelmed by all the connections and cable possibilities.  I bought ""Hook Me Up!"" to get a handle on this so I could do it myself, and, though somewhat longish, it was exactly what I needed and savd me at least $150 compared to a so-called installation, plus I know now what I am doing!  Highly recommend it to others who are in my situation.",1187049600,5,1274,4.301255230125523
