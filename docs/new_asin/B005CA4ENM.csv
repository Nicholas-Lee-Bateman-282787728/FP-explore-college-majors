8464991,5,B005CA4ENM,"My husband is an avid hiker.  He used map & compass until I bought him a Garmin Etrex 20 for Christmas.  He had it for a year without using it.  He bought this instructional DVD on Amazon and it made all of the difference as far as how to use the device.  It was very, very, helpful.",1382832000,,283,3.912280701754386
8464992,1,B005CA4ENM,"There is almost no ""How To"" on this DVD. This is pretty much a light pass over the Menu Functions which I had already done. Not much more usefull than the eTrex manual, which is also pretty sketchy & confusing. Definitly not worth the money.",1355270400,3,241,4.377777777777778
8464993,1,B005CA4ENM,"Five star transaction went smooth as silk and DVD was quickly received.  Unfortunately, after watching the DVD, we were extremely disappointed with its lack of content.  I would not recommend this DVD to anyone!  More or less, the video basically has someone narrate through the menu ""this product has a lot of features but we won't show you how to use any of them"".  There was zero technical how-to content.  For geocaching, there was one quick sentence mentioning it was possible.  Save your $$$.",1333324800,5,498,4.869047619047619
