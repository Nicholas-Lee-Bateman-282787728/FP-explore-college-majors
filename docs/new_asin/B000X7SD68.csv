8227162,3,B000X7SD68,"The Phantom Fiend, 1932 film

It begins with a police whistle. The newspapers tell of a murder, a 1,000 reward is offered. Telephone operators make connections. One reporter is told to concentrate on this case. A man asks about a room to let, he speaks with an accent. Michel Angeloff is a musician, he plays the piano. Another man arrives at this house, he tells about a woman murdered in a public call box. He calls his newspaper with the story about her being heard by a telephone operator. What should be done to this fiend? People speak their opinions. The new roomer objects to portraits of women in his room. Miss Benton talks to officials about what she heard on the phone.

One man identifies the murderer, he escaped from an institution, and is embittered against all women. [No pictures of him?] Mrs. Benton visits her rented room, Michel sees this. Mr. Benton switches bedrooms with his daughter, he doesnt want her talking to the roomer. Miss Benton would like to go away. Michel asks her to not look at him, and stay away from him. The lights go out, a blown fuse. Later at night a woman screams, there is a police whistle. A reporter calls it in, it was just around the corner. Daisy will go out with Michel. There is a description of the murder: tall, thin, foreign looking. Michel and Daisy talk after the play. Michel likes the fog and dark of night.

Joe finds them together and takes Daisy home. Go back to your own country says Joe. Jealousy? Then another body is found! At home Michel washes his hand from a dark substance. The newspapers tell of another Avenger murder! Benton calls the police, he saw the bloody handkerchief of Michel. The police arrive, Scotland Yard arrests Michel to take him in. But Michel breaks free and climbs out of a window. Where can he be? Michel goes to a dance hall, a scarf hides his hands. But he is recognized, and flees. Michel calls Daisy at work, she leaves to meet him. But its the wrong man! Michel shows up to rescue Daisy from Stefan. I had to do it! Michel explains the facts to Daisy.

This is an interesting story in spite of the poor condition of the film. Why would Michel go out in public with handcuffs? It adds drama to the story. The Lodger was inspired by Jack the Ripper and is Marie Belloc-Lowndes most famous novel. The English believed that Jack had to be a foreigner to commit such crimes; they knew serial murderers cant be English. This is a newer version of The Lodger, a 1926 silent movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock.",1473638400,,2501,4.49010989010989

8227167,5,B000X7SD68,"Based on THE LODGER, this is Director, Maurice Elvey's take on the original silent suspense thriller. As such, THE PHANTOM FIEND is a classic in its own right. The story is about a ""foreign"" tenant named Angeloff (Ivor Novello) in a London boarding house owned by the Bunting family. He comes to stay just as a murdering maniac is on the loose. Who is Angeloff? Could he be the odious killer of the title? He certainly acts and speaks in a peculiar manner, but is he a madman, or simply odd? His deepening relationship w/ Daisy Bunting (Elizabeth Allen) is the emotional heart of the film. Fear and suspicion of ""others"" and / or ""strangers"" is explored. Novello plays his eccentric role convincingly, mixing controlled menace w/ a strange vulnerability. He reminds me of young Bela Lugosi, being mysteriously sinister! Elvey uses some interesting lighting and camera techniques to give the sense of paranoia and growing fear. A wonderful movie, in spite of its muffled sound quality, and aggravating skips, pops, and jumps...",1384732800,8,1026,4.936416184971098
8227168,4,B000X7SD68,This early Hitchcock was great except for a very weak ending. I thought Hitch would be more clever than that. There was a prime opportunity missed here for greatness but I expect he was trying to make certain we never saw it coming. The print is fair-poor and the sound is bad so that you will need earphones to hear it well. Still I am glad I watched it especially after seeing the new movie of his life with his wife. This really lets one into seeing the learning process they both went through in evolving their style!,1362009600,2,521,4.326530612244898
8227169,5,B000X7SD68,"I did not get the video but viewed it off the DARK CRIMES 50 Pack.  First I will say the audio is not good.  It is so bad it is a challenge to listen to it.  I feel that it is such and old and obscure film that the copiers did the best they could with it.  As we know many films of this era are totally ruined and cannot even be salvaged.  If you are a stickler about this, I suggest you also get the 50 Pack where you would get more Fiend for your Buck, instead of buying the single DVD.  The photography is dazzling, however.  It is very high contrast, with bright whites, and dark blacks.  There are many, many Hitchcockian type angles.  The actors are quite right for 1920s-30s England and the Foreigner is dramatic and reminiscent of Bela Lugosi, the accent, expressions.  There are times that we are actually tense as we watch some of the mysterious scenes.  I, as an artist, loved the movie.",1353196800,4,898,4.223529411764706
8227170,3,B000X7SD68,"THE PHANTOM FIEND (UK-1932) - Ivor Novello, Elizabeth Allan, A.W. Baskcomb, Barbara Everest, Jack Hawkins

First talking version based on the Jack the Ripper case (and ""The Lodger"") has Ivor Novello as a foreign musician renting a room from a British family who becomes the main suspect in a series of murders. The film is hampered by terrible sound and stilted acting. Despite these drawbacks, the last reel or so is worth the price of admission.

Welsh-born Novello is most convincing as Michel Angelo, the Hungarian violinist/composer/suspect. This superstar of early British cinema demonstrates considerable pianistic skill in this film.

Elizabeth Allan plays here Daisy Bunting, the striking beauty that Angelo falls in love with. She's best remembered in America as Mrs. Copperfield in George Cukor's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-PERSONAL-HISTORY-ADVENTURES-EXPERIENCE-AND-OBSERVATION-OF-DAVID-COPPERFIELD-THE-YOUNGER/dp/B000GRUQK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE PERSONAL HISTORY, ADVENTURES, EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION OF DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER</a>&nbsp;(1935).

Archie Baskcomb (Mr. Bunting) was in the original 1904 stage production of J.M. Barrie's PETER PAN. He had a brief movie career: 4 pictures in one year or so.
