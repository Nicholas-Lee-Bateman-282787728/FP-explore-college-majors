7882527,5,630507898X,"You can never go wrong with the maestro, luciano pavarotti. I love pavarotti and could listen to him and his friends all the time. So I can only say good things.",1437177600,,161,4.225806451612903
7882528,5,630507898X,"I enjoyed the concert very much.  Any Pavarotti fan would.  I think the Barcelona performance as a whole was better simply because the audience was so engaged and enthralled.  Performing in a large stadium as opposed to a concert house has to be quite different for both performer and audience.  I find it interesting that even though Pavarotti did not sing Mozart at this concert, he did manage to slip in his Flute Concerto, so great was his love of Mozart.  I too, share with him that emotion.",1241222400,,496,4.590909090909091

7882531,3,630507898X,"This concert is pretty good, but it's not as good as perhaps Pavarotti's performaces alongside Domingo and Carreras. Perhaps I expected too much and so I was disappointed more than I should have been.
I felt very little emotion emanating from Pavorotti, I suppose after singing them for so many years its hard to give energy every single time, but still it wasn't really satisfying. However E Lucevan le stelle and the Vesti la giubba were the stand outs of this particular DVD. The other well known stuff like O sole mio, nessun dorma and torna surriento were enjoyable but not particularly moving.
Overall his voice seemed a little tired(which is to be expected at that age, and after 5 encores), but the fact that he stands there with he arms out-stretched soaking in the attention after EVERY-SINGLE-ARIA does get on my nerves.
It was good to watch anyway.",1105488000,4,860,4.778523489932886
7882532,5,630507898X,"An excellent selection of arias; Wonderfully performed by the great Pavarotti. This is a must-have for any Pavarotti fan, and any fan of opera and wonderful singing.",1036627200,7,165,5.148148148148148
7882533,5,630507898X,"This is a really good DVD.  It was taped during the 1990 World Cup, and in my view it is far superior to the Three Tenors Concert taped a couple of months later in Rome.  Those who have read my previous reviews will  probably realise that I am  a complete unashamedly Pavarotti addict - and  this will please all his millions of fans around the globe.
All his  standard repertoire pieces are here, including an excellent ""Pourquoi  me reveiller"" and a quite electrifying ""Vesti la guibba"".  The encores are outstanding, and the whole programme has been put together  thoughtfully.  It is a shame that he couldn't have been persauded to sing  ""Ch'ella mi creda"" or ""Che gelida manina"", or dare I  say, a little bit more Verdi?
Anyway, this is Big Lucy at his best - and  the audience love it, as will you if you invest in this DVD.  When it  arrived, we all settled down to watch it with a glass of wine after dinner  one Saturday night.  You know, my mother in law insisted that I order her a  copy from amazon.com immediately.  Which I duly did.  Is there a better  recommendation that that?",964224000,21,1092,4.441624365482234
