In ancient times, a curse is placed on an enormous black pearl; whereupon it is lost at sea.

In modern times a scientist is diving and discovers some treasure, among which is that accursed pearl. His partner, immediately feeling the effects of the curse, kills him and absconds with the treasure. The scientist's widow and little girl live in penury and the killer thrives. He marries and has three sons before his wife abandons them.

Our story naturally has one of his sons falling in love with that now grown daughter whose mother had been harpooned to death!

We have evil villainesses who plot against father and sons; the abandoning wife and mother turns up as a hopeless alcoholic, repentant and ill. The daughter takes a scientific exchange job between her university and one in Toronto, Canada, so we have a travelogue, as well. The editing for this one is rougher than usual, though...

8363885,1,B002CCDCCW,"I noticed numerous scenes missing on this telenovela. On CD #2 there was about 5 minutes of telenovela running WITHOUT audio. I purchased this as a gift to my mom and although she liked what she saw, I was left feeling unsatisfied because I did see the original telenovela.

My DVD set was 4 DVD's and approx 714 mins run time. It should have been longer and possibly more DVD's to have captured the full telenovela.",1262131200,2,416,4.473684210526316
