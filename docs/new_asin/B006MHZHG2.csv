5004871,5,B006MHZHG2,"The director and actors really did a good job on this movie. Sometimes straight to DVD movies can seem a little fake but this one is a must see! The ending was quite unexpected- a good thing. But I wish there was more to it. I would have loved to see what happened to the main actress's character, etc. It left me wanting for more.",1355616000,,331,4.107692307692307
5004872,1,B006MHZHG2,"I'm sure the movie was good, but I was too angry about the swimming. I swam for 18 years at a competitive level and I am wondering if the movie producer even researched what good swimming looks like or how one qualifies for the Olympic team. Ariel was not a good swimmer formwise and you don't get asked to ""try out"" for the Olympics. Other than that the movie was good but I couldn't get past the fact that the movie producer clearly had no idea what swimming actually is....if you're going to make a movie like this at least research the sport!!!",1355097600,,548,4.330097087378641
5004873,3,B006MHZHG2,I watched this movie twice in hopes of really hoping that I would enjoy it better the second time that I watched it. I did not. The plot was stiff and moved a bit too slow for my taste. I would however recommened it to an older viewing audience with perhaps time to enjoy on a calm Sunday afternoon after a church service. The acting was not poor in any way I must add for anyone interested however do not invest a large amount of financial obligation into the movie prior to making this purchase would be my advice.,1348531200,,516,4.222222222222222
5004874,5,B006MHZHG2,This was an excellent movie and actoring. Mahogany Monae braced the screen with graceful confidence. I enjoyed her very much.,1338854400,,125,5.3
5004875,4,B006MHZHG2,"While the writing was, at times, overwrought and preachy, the performances were solid.

I was particularly impressed with the Mahogany Monae and Lionel Gentle. Monae, while a bit old for her role and Gentle, a bit young for his, delivered nuanced performances, in spite of the heavy handedness of the script.

While the subject matter is tough to watch, I was impressed with the movie overall and would recommend it.",1334102400,4,416,4.928571428571429

8500884,3,B006MHZHG2,"The movie is like a story on showing what's around to know how to meet the people you might not see them as kind they turn to be even if they're bad or good. Just have to trust the people that really care about and never do anything to you, always try to be careful at anyone who would be good in & outside or the wrong people who could do wrong stuff to you.",1412035200,,359,3.8

8500889,4,B006MHZHG2,"Ariel was a 16 year old girl with a dream. After she made the United States swim team, she began training for the Olympics. Shortly after tragedy strikes. Ariel was raped by a young policeman. The police officer turned her life all the way around and made terrible threats towards her and family. Ariels dreams of becoming an Olympic swimmer was crushed.
 The movie Black Butterfly was directed by Mark Harris. A few of the star characters include Elizabeth Abraham, Sheree Bynum, and Ron Cooper. This movie came out on the 17th day of March 2010. The star rating of this movie is a 6.6 out of 10. Black Butterfly is simply about a 16 year old girl who has dreams of going to the Olympics for swimming. Ariel was brutally raped and this event changed her life.
 Ariel loved to swim, it was one of her favorite things to do. As I have stated before, she made the United States swim team and she began training for the Olympics. A couple of days later, Ariel was brutally raped by her fathers coworker. This event changed her life completely. Everything she believed in was torn. She was threatened that if she were to tell someone, he would kill her and her family. Ariel loved her family so much and she knew that if she told anyone, she would cause trouble. However, holding the pain inside didn't do anything but make the situation worse. She became very terrified and didn't know what else to do. Ariel began to become rude to her boyfriend and she started treating him badly. She tried her hardest to forget about the situation as a whole. Ariel even tried have sex with her boyfriend. Although trying to forget did not work.
 Ariel began to become so frustrated to the point where she could no longer bare the pain. Furthermore, her mood began to change toward everything. Not only did her mood change about swimming and her boyfriend, but they changed for her family as well. Ariel had nobody to talk to, to get this off her chest. Meanwhile she wrote in her diary because she felt as if that was the only thing she could talk to just to keep everyone safe. In essence with Ariel becoming so fed up, she decided to go practice swimming alone. As she began to swim, the thoughts of her being raped raced heavily through her head. With all of these thoughts on her mind, she drowned.
 I would recommend teenagers to watch this movie. I believe that more adults will like this movie a lot more than children would. However, I found this movie very interesting because this movie was just like a real life situation. Now a days, young girls are being raped by these strangers that can tend to be close to their families. Everything that happened in this movie, happens in our everyday life. Therefore, I think that parents should pay close attention to people they introduce to their kids because you cannot trust anyone. Anything can happen to anyone. These men are very sickening now a days and these women are as well.",1397174400,,2923,4.53030303030303
