5424576,4,B00AGKH44E,"Roy Barcroft steals the show! He dominates every scene he's in,which are many, and is the best actor in the movie. Lots of action,good photography and other actors kinda fill the void without arousing too much interest in their particular abilities.",1427760000,,249,5.097560975609756

5424579,5,B00AGKH44E,I have the VHS where the source for this DVD probably originated. So it has very good video and audio quality. The DVD format allows me to rewind without tape damage so I am quite pleased. Since I am a big Carole Forman fan it was nice to replay her scenes without suffering tape integrity.,1410998400,,290,4.290909090909091
5424580,4,B00AGKH44E,"Four stars out of five rating. Kirk Alyn (late from the first Superman serial) and Rosemary LaPlanche are good hero and heroine casting, and Carol Forman and Roy Barcroft superb villains. Typical Republic late in the forties and heavy on the stock footage.  Most of the action by the looks of the age of the cars is from ten years previous.  They use footage that is not grainy and nasty as much as Universal did at any time.  It is funny to see them reuse the collapsing bridge Chapter 1 cliffhanger from The Adventures of Captain Marvel, originally Louise Currie shouting ""Back up, Whitey, back up!"", used the same year in The Phantom Plainsmen with Bob Steele shouting ""Back up, Stony, back up!"", and now, Rosemary LaPlanche shouting, ""Back up, Dave, back up!""  This serial has the first of the late Republic script devices to get around the stock footage, where the hero says,basically,  It's too late to chase to them, let's go back to the office, and lets figure out where they are going to strike next.  (The second at the late Republic devices is, ""we are too well known by the good guys.  I am going to get my brother Jake and his mob to pull the latest crime."")",1385683200,3,1171,4.521327014218009
5424581,5,B00AGKH44E,"As a kid, I was a hugh fan of Kirk Alyn as the original ""SUPERMAN"" in the movies. I remember going to a neighborhood movie house to see ""Federal Agents vs. Underworld, Inc."" for (12) consecutive Saturday matinees. The week to week cliff-hangers kept us on the edge of our seats at the movie house, and we talked about it all week while at school. I was very excited when Federal Agents came out on DVD and had to have it as part of my childhood memories collections. The picture quality is wonderfully restored.  It is great, clean, fun!  P.S. It only cost 10 cents for a whole Saturday  afternoon at the movies. These cliff hangers were played before the scheduled pictures! That's right.....(2) pictures! Thanks for the memories!",1378684800,7,731,4.651162790697675

8551434,5,B00AGKH44E,"I give it 5 stars for historical value only. The plot and acting are worth about a half star. How can ANY 'secret' agents be so stupid as to keep getting beat at every turn ?? Pathetic, to say the least. The only bright spot - Carol Forman. Would have had a great career in 'stag' movies. She had a great little body.",1455235200,2,317,4.0476190476190474
