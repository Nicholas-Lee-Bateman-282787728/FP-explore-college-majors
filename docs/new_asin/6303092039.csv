559548,5,6303092039,"I agree with the review by Jose Lopez This is a funny movie that came way before the Nazi like Political Correctness movement I am not a P.C. person and will never be one. Those people are like swine happily going over a cliff. Busting could never be made today and neither could the Hilarious T.V. series ""All In The Family"". its going to be interesting hearing the P.C. explanations(I won't be here) that are spouted about after the Rapture occurs.",1424563200,4,450,4.567901234567901
559549,5,6303092039,Great example of early 70's nitty gritty shoot'em up urban cop movies that inspired Starsky and Hutch and Beasty Boys videos with Robert Blake essentially playing the character he would play on TV in Barretta.,1416873600,2,209,5.0
559550,3,6303092039,It was good to see these actors in their younger years. This movie was a good example of how far cinema has come to make movies more realistic and engaging.,1404777600,,156,4.233333333333333
559551,4,6303092039,"This is a film that I read about.
And decided to buy it on a whim.
I did enjoy the film.
And for why it is .
The quality is good.
However. I now mainly buy Blu-Rays/but I still think this MOD/DVD-R release was worth the investment.",1386374400,,231,3.9361702127659575
559552,5,6303092039,it was a good one he is funny and the movie was a  good comedy action always love watching Robert Blake,1359849600,,103,3.9047619047619047
559553,5,6303092039,"This movie and the times reflected in it are times we need again,When people were actually disgusted by obscene behavior and were not afraid to comment on it for fear of being labeled an bigot when in fact it's the truth and reality. An Film like this could not come out now without the so-called LGBTCommunity coming out to censor it and ban it just cause it does not jive with it's World Free of Controversy despite Such Bullying folks into their set of mind by namecalling there are still of those out there will never bend to no one's will. The Movie while drawn-out and long at times is hilarious as it is offensive,It is refreshing in an world then And Now Gone mad. Orlando Vargas and the ""Club"" is the best scene and the Dear Mom Line by Elliot Gould's Character. Although I am not an fan of Robert Blake(Except the movie Coast to Coast)I enjoyed this movie and it's stance whether intentional or not to offend I found it funny,Hollywood only makes movies now designed to Offend Christianity but it will not tote from it's line of ""Pc-Ness"" regarding so-called Equal Rights. I Love the Movie And will see it again,Thank God For living in an Free Country.",1351987200,6,1162,4.511848341232228
559554,4,6303092039,"This film was one of a series of very good late 60's and 70's pictures I saw in South America at a movie-club over the course of several years. I then resaw Busting on an independent tv channel in 1982. It says a lot about corruption at the public and private levels and ends with Gould's throwing away his badge in a gesture of disgust. This is a hard look at a country already with problems in the 70's and in deep trouble now in political and economic terms with the nation deeply divided and no clear consensus for remedial action. The scene at the gay bar where the two detectives decide to dance together elicited a curious reaction from the viewers in Uruguay-a mixture of disbelief and nervous amusement. I also laughed, perhaps too loudly, but at the end, I was ""not amused"". See this within the context of Welcome Home, Soldier Boys, Brewster McCloud, Hail, The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, The Gypsy Moths, The Great White Hope, Easy Rider and many more from a time when movies were not made for mental midgets.",1303689600,8,1021,4.524324324324325

7837417,4,6303092039,Good story. Not over the top other than the personalities going overboard as you might expect to keep your interest if you start to waver. Print and color not bad. I also enjoyed the soundtrack.,1456790400,,194,4.571428571428571
