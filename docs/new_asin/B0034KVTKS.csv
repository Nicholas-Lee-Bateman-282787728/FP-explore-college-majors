4068641,5,B0034KVTKS,"I really enjoyed this DVD from start to finish.  I have one of their previous DVDs and this is the best of the two.  It is worth the purchase.  Maysa, Joycelyn Brown and the other Incognito veterans put on a great performance.  Highly recommended!",1275782400,,247,4.545454545454546
4068642,5,B0034KVTKS,"I have always bought Incognito CD's over the years and have almost their full collection of music. However, I have never been able to see them in person or a live video until now. This video is truly amazing! It is awesome to finally see the musicians and singers perform and the sound and video quality is just incredible. If anyone is a true Incognito fan, then they need to get this video because it is worth every penny of it! It makes me even more happy that I have it on Blu Ray...there is no comparison. Unbelievable video!",1274832000,,530,4.363636363636363
4068643,4,B0034KVTKS,"I was glad to discover this DVD via a random search for something new by Incognito. Good thing I found this treasure. Maysa and Jocelyn Brown appear together! Both had big star turns fronting for ""Bluey"" 's acid jazz ensemble of talent. I love the E, W & F and Stevie Wonder influence that always flows from ""Bluey"" & Co. Strong harmonizing vocals, big horns and STRINGS abound throughout this five star live concert. I gave the DVD of this four stars because of the too dark stage lighting. Otherwise, nothing else can be said negatively of the show. I felt like I was there.
This is a great example of all that makes Incognito possibly the best Acid Jazz ensemble of all.",1273104000,5,673,4.479674796747967
4068644,4,B0034KVTKS,"I have been a fan of Incognito since I was a young girl. They have been around for 30 years, can you believe it? Sadly, they do not come to the United States to tour often so I bought this DVD. While the camera work is not as sharp as it could be, the performance itself is great. The sound is wonderful and I felt like I was actually at the concert.",1272931200,5,350,3.875

4068673,5,B0034KVTKS,"I live in Philadelphia but I went to London for the weekend just to see this concert. It was the best concert I have EVER been to.

4068689,1,B0034KVTKS,"Maysa is off key  and load.
 All of the singers seem and little uninspired. Also this probably shouldn't be said but I don't wanna spend this much money to watch a bunch of fat women.",1377043200,,183,4.2
4068690,5,B0034KVTKS,"I have always loved Incognito and when I saw that there was an available concert on Bluray, I just had to have it. Awesome audio and video quality...a must have for an Incognito fan.",1372204800,,182,4.382352941176471
4068691,5,B0034KVTKS,"Let me start by saying there is not another band on the planet who's music makes you want to just get up and move than Incognito's. This Blu-ray confirms that notion. After a long day at work and somewhat tired, I saw that this disc had arrived in the mail. Being a big fan of theirs, I was excited to watch it but felt it was late and should just watch it over the weekend when I had more time. So I ended up deciding to just sit back and listen to a few songs and call it a night.. Well that lasted about 30 secs.into the first song when I found myself up and about and turning up the volume. Needless to say I could not turn it off. The energy and passion Bluey puts into his music just takes over you. Every song, every performer is just plain awesome. This is some of the finest music you'll ever hear, period! The concert is long, almost 3 hrs. When it was finally over it was 2 am. I was exhausted by then but had a smile from ear to ear. I was so glad I did not wait as it was one of the most enjoyable concerts I have ever watched. The sound quality is good and the video is good, but my 5 stars goes to the music. Bluey is a genius. there is no one who composes, arranges and performs better than him and I mean no one. Even if you have all of their CD's, (and why wouldn't you?) this blu-ray is worth it if for no other reason than it's Incognito, simply the best band in the world. There is nothing more to say!",1362441600,3,1423,3.9273356401384083
4068692,5,B0034KVTKS,"My husband has been an Incognito fan since the 90s and has a lot of their music on CD, but not on DVD/Bluray. I bought this as a surprise gift for him and he has enjoyed every minute of it! Lots of great tracks and vision of the stage. I highly recommend it. :)",1362182400,,261,3.8518518518518516
4068693,4,B0034KVTKS,This was a first for me and I was impressed with the content of the concert. The clarity was great and the sound is magnificent a must for serious music lovers.,1361318400,,160,4.193548387096774
4068694,1,B0034KVTKS,"I have almost all of the albums of Incognito and I love their music.
This performance does not live up to the standards,and synchronization of their music.

Probably I cant understand it.

I suppose the recording is not that great and does it pick up the nuances of Bluey's compositions or maybe Incognito is not supposed to be doing Live performances.
Sorry, but didn't stick.",1360022400,,377,4.7846153846153845
4068705,3,B0034KVTKS,"Good concert, the the audio was a little flat.  Disappointing for a Blu Ray with a DTS HD Master Audio.  Video quality was good.",1352764800,,128,4.291666666666667
4068706,5,B0034KVTKS,"This show wrapped the 20 year history of Incognito in grand fashion . . . What a great sound, great singing and just an overall great show!! Love Bluey's reference to Banda Black Rio - Now I understand more about Incognito's sound. Loved it!",1336003200,,241,4.5
4068707,5,B0034KVTKS,"I don't want to start by saying that this is a most for all Incognito fans, because I ""know"" EVERYBODY will enjoy this.  I've had the pleasure of seeing them live, but this is truly the concert that I've always wanted to see.  I have to say that your ears will visit a buffet of music unlike any other, including the live strings being conducted by the wonderful Simon Hale.  Your eyes will be delighted because this was filmed in high definition.  The biggest surprise for me has to be Jocelyn Brown doing her rendition of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"".  I had tears in my eyes.  The entire concert was top notch.  It's the perfect tool to introduce everyone to the wonderful sounds of Incognito.  Simply AMAZING!!",1319846400,,717,4.546875
4068708,5,B0034KVTKS,"I have purchased a few of their DVD's (Live performances) and CD's for my husband as gifts, and all I can say is...I plan to buy every CD & DVD they ever made!! I am TOTALLY SERIOUS!! You will become addicted to Incognito! I can't wait to get in my car in the morning to listen to them - I can't wait to get in my car in the afternoon to listen to them - We (My husband, myself along with our 2 boys (15 and 11) can't wait for the weekend to just JAM with them all night long!! It's crazy!! Listen for yourself and you will truly understand!! INCOGNITO is REAL MUSIC!!",1316563200,2,568,3.991228070175439

4068710,2,B0034KVTKS,"This concert is lacking. I don't know exactly whats missing, but they don't spark listening enthusiasm. The audio is not as clear as I expected. The vocalists are not top notch. I love my Incognito CD's . I originally had this music on cassettes, then bought it again on CD.  This Blu Ray doesn't make it.",1297641600,,305,4.446428571428571
4068711,5,B0034KVTKS,"Just like everyone else that wrote reviews on this DVD, I have been a long time Incognito follower.  There is nothing special being done on the stage (i.e. stage decoration, lightings, etc.) - it's just simply great music, the way I like it.  To top it off, my fave singer from Indonesia, Dira Sugandi, got to sing with Maysa on ""Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing""",1282521600,,360,4.4393939393939394
4068712,2,B0034KVTKS,"Since it was a huge show celebrating Incognito's 30th Anniversary I was really hoping to see Incognito's LEAD singers such as Pamela Anderson(aka Anaya)Joy Malcolm,Chyna & Mark Anthoni. It did not happen!!!!Not even Kelli Sae was there!!!
I was also hoping to hear songs like JUMP TO MY LOVE,CHANGE,OUT OF THE STORM,GIVIN IT UP,GOOD LOVE,CRAZY FOR YOU....
none was sung... Very disappointed show. Not Incognito's best DVD.I do not recommend! Stick to the other DVD shows and don't waste your money on this one.",1280448000,3,510,5.083333333333333
4068713,5,B0034KVTKS,"This wonderful blu ray video captures the 30th anniversary celebration of the band and musical collective Incognito at indigO2 at the O2 in London.  This concert was a retrospective of 30 years of great, great music from Bluey and company.  Being a fan from Tribes, Vibes and Scribes all the way to Tales From the Beach, the concert captures many of my favorite songs of theirs and introduces me to new ones.

This was my first time hearing a wonderful new vocalist by the name of Vanessa Haynes who rocked the opening song ""Talkin Loud"" and one of my personal favorites, ""Everyday"".  Certainly a celebration like this could not happen without having Maysa, who was the key vocalist in their breakthrough to the US market.  She brings her usual stellar effort on ""Still a Friend of Mine"", ""Wild and Peaceful"" and ""Don't You Worry Bout a Thing"", just to name a few.  Joy Rose and Tony Momrelle show their vocal excellence on all of their featured numbers.  The surprise appearance of Jocelyn Brown was a special bonus to the evening.  Though I would have liked to hear more from Imaani that night, it was great to hear her set the place on fire with ""N. O. T"".  On all the vocal and instrumental numbers, Bluey and his fellow musicians show their skill and creativity in ways consistently exciting to the ears.  Having the live string players on some of the numbers really took things to the next level!

A first rate concert experience for anyone who appreciates great songs and great musicianship.  I recommend it highly!",1276214400,,1522,4.680451127819549
4068714,5,B0034KVTKS,This concert is AWESOME!!! This is music at it's finest. I bought this in HD but then found it came out in Bluray. While buying it in Bluray I found that there was also a CD. I Bought the Bluray and CD version at the same time. Video is a little dark at times but that proves to be insignificant. Everyone that comes to my house or gets in my car is treated to this OUTSTANDING show!!!,1275782400,9,385,4.012987012987013
8388407,4,B0034KVTKS,This is a great DVD/BluRay but I wish the performance they did in Jakarta Indonesia around the same time frame was available on a disc. It can be viewed on YouTube and is well worth checking out.  Imaani and Joy Rose are both such beautiful and talented singers and the band is tight and funky as hell.,1510358400,,302,4.298245614035087

8388415,5,B0034KVTKS,"The greatest band ever, I enjoyed this dvd more than live in Jakarta for one it was in widescreen comparedto 4:3. Two the band had its full string section and a rotating cast of musicians. This is the show Bluey would have dreamed of, having every musician they wanted to have. Live in Jakarta is a great show,  but the band seem more comfortable and relaxed at this very special event. Love Incognito!",1435968000,,402,4.506849315068493
