5725059,5,B00CL0MCN0,This is the final set for a great program and it is the culmination of a collection spanning the late 50s to the early 60s.  Yeah it is full of anachronisms like smoking and drinking but murder never gets old....and no matter what Perry always stood by his client.,1376352000,,264,4.387755102040816
5725060,5,B00CL0MCN0,"I am a Perry Mason.  I was a little too young to remember or understand it when it was aired in the 50s-60s.  My parents watched it religiously.  As I had gotten older, and saw some reruns, I soon got hooked on it, and began buying the series on DVD.  They don't make TV series like this anymore!",1376352000,4,296,4.051724137931035
5725061,5,B00CL0MCN0,"Many fans of Perry Mason have watched for the release of each season expectantly, hoping that the momentum stayed with us and the entire series made it to DVD. At last, that is now the case with the last half of Season Nine in release.

I watched Perry Mason as a kid, but I became an entrenched fan during the years that TBS ran the series in the 80s. I saw them round and round, until to this day many of them are like old friends when I view them again on DVD. However, these old friends bring continued surprises, as the DVD sets have the entire show, something that has likely never been true in any syndication of the series.

I never felt that the quality of the acting, mysteries, or production dropped throughout Perry Mason's long run. The final few shows were as entertaining as the first.

As others have mentioned, this set contains the very entertaining dual role episode, with Raymond Burr playing both Mason and the alcoholic merchant marine hired to get Mason into hot water.

Not only have I always been entertained by Perry Mason and his mysteries, but I learned a few things along the way too. Mason was a great role model with his firm stands against those without ethics. I admired that backbone and made sure to grow it myself, and it has served me well over the decades.

We can't thank most of them in person anymore, but regardless my thanks go out to Erle Stanley Gardner, Raymond Burr, Barbara Hale, William Hopper, William Tallman, Ray Collins and the dozens of judges, hundreds of guest stars, and the outstanding writers who brought us so much entertainment for so long, and made these characters our friends.

5725062,5,B00CL0MCN0,"After slowly the first eight seasons (and Volume 1 of the 9th season) I was happy to see the final DVD in this wonderful classic courtroom drama series be available..... I had pre-ordered it so I wouldn't miss the coming out party. Tho most of the shows are from the late 1950s through 1960s complete with over-sized cars and Jackie-0 dress styles in black and white -- the plots, court strategies and investigations are good classic clean drama ---- unlike the over-sexed, sometimes vulgar and exploitative shows of today.",1374796800,3,523,4.887640449438202
5725063,5,B00CL0MCN0,"I have the entire Perry Mason series you can never get too tired of watching the episodes over again you always seem to pick up something new and learn how our system works I just wish there were more. I just wish Perry Mason was alive today we also have a great cast which Perry Mason wouldn't survive without Della Street, Paul Drake and district attorney Hamilton Burger and lieutenant Tragg.

5725064,5,B00CL0MCN0,"As Perry himself might have known, Samuel Johnson wrote, ""Nothing focuses the mind like a hanging."" So when CBS announced the death of the nine year old Perry Mason series around Thanksgiving in 1965, the show's writers were set free.

What followed was a slew of quixotic scripts concluding with ""The Case of the Final Fadeout"" where the trial was presided over by Erle Stanley Gardner himself and all the backstage crew got speaking parts since the murder took place on the soundstage itself. Even better were some of the other scripts such as the one where Burr was the heavy in a body double episode.

This is not the Perry Mason you know and love. It stays true to the formula, but where the creative juices of the writers are set ever so slightly free, anything can happen, and often does.",1371254400,6,795,4.591549295774648
5725065,5,B00CL0MCN0,"The last half of the final season has not been delivered as yet, it's too bad a 10th season wasn't filmed, we might have finally gotten our top TV attorney in color. At any rate the ninth season does have one episode in color, The case of the Twice-Told Twist. I strongly recommend this volume to Perry Mason fans everywhere!",1371081600,4,325,4.433333333333334
5725066,5,B00CL0MCN0,"Perry Mason is one of my favorite TV programs along with The Adventures of Superman and the Lone Ranger (BTW the entire Lone Ranger series will be released on 6/4/13!). It was, for the most part, intelligently written, directed and acted.

HOWEVER, starting in season 7, the set-up is sometimes so long that the court-room part seems rushed. Some of the last 3 seasons or so would have benefited by being two parters. It's a shame that they NEVER did that just like it's shame they didn't film more of them in LIVING COLOR.

But even so it's like having an old friend visit and is still very enjoyable! It's just too bad that todays shows stink so much (the rare exception is NCIS and maybe Pawn Stars).

It was nice that after the show was canceled they finished the season out. Today if you're canc'd you're lucky if they even show the episodes tape let alone those written but not yet taped.

The only thing about this release that makes me sad is it's the last one.

Does anyone know if the TV movies will be available on DVD anytime soon?",1368403200,9,1043,4.411458333333333
5725067,5,B00CL0MCN0,"Perry Mason was notified that it would not be renewed for a tenth season, on November 15, 1965, about halfway through the 9th season's filming. But unlike, say, CBS's Rawhide, which was abruptly canceled that same fall, Perry Mason was allowed to complete the season and film a full 30 episodes. So, many of these episodes in season 9 volume two, have a nice touch, giving the writers, actors, and producers a chance to leave the viewer in good stead. There is some great comedy in this volume, like Victor Buono's broad manipulations as the mastermind of inept adolescent thieves, in color, in The Case Of The Twice Told Twist; his slow burns while pondering the fools around him is his best appearance in the series. Raymond Burr gets to play Perry Mason and a drunken sailor in The Case Of The Dead Ringer. While actors playing their evil doubles is often cited as the point when a series jumps the shark, Burr plays the two opposites with such relish that it is a treat to see. Perry Mason wraps up on a high note with the all-star, and many amateurs, Case Of The Final Fadeout, placing the finishing touch on a superb show",1367452800,109,1127,4.529411764705882

5725075,4,B00CL0MCN0,"Your honor... I do NOT object. Final season of Perry Mason on television. They all had aged, some of the plots were reused. but if you had made 271 episodes I think your plots would have run thin too. Earl Stanley Gardner was a masterful writer. His character was insightful, brilliant, and not too full of himself. Of course the original character in the movies was a little more arrogant , but also married Della  Street as I remember.
I think the thing I find most fun with the tv series is how they used the same actors  in like 4 or 5 episodes under different character names... sometimes guilty, sometimes character witnesses.. Sometimes the murder victim. but that ends up playing tricks with you the viewer... do I know this one???? wait... isn't that the  guy or girl who.... no, wait... I am not sure I remember this one... and you watch it again! clever!!
Anyway... loved the series... Thanks Gail Patrick Jackson for developing the tv series. She was a good actress in movies like My man Godfrey.. Pretty too...  So if you love the series and hate the heavy editing metv has done, buy these before they are gone. Court is in recess until 10 am.",1496793600,3,1156,4.516746411483253

5725103,3,B00CL0MCN0,"I've really liked watching the entirety of the Perry Mason show in chronological order. I think it may be one of the best series that TV has produced in its history.  It's wonderfully cast, and has a lot of memorable moments, even if Perry Mason is almost certain to win in court.  Unfortunately, I think that the later shows are not as good as the earlier ones.  I'm guessing that this is probably the fault of the producers and CBS.  It seems as if they were trying to make the later episodes of the show more relevant by bringing in a lot of pop culture references and having new original music composed by Richard Shores.  But, in my opinion, all of this made the show worse.  Shores' music is more gimmicky (and often goofy) than the stock music used in the earlier seasons, much of which was by Bernard Herrmann, and the pop culture references make the later episodes of the series more kitschy than the earlier programs.  The writing and dialog also seem to get worse with the later shows, and the focus often moves away from the mystery to the characters or the (then) contemporary state of politics or society.  I'm guessing that whoever was in charge thought moving away from what made the show work in the beginning was a good idea, but it was exactly the opposite.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend Perry Mason to fans of  mystery shows and earlier TV.",1469232000,3,1364,4.530612244897959

5725110,4,B00CL0MCN0,"Perry Mason Season 9 Volume 2

These fifteen TV shows from 1966 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the Court of Last Resort which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The cars tell of product placement. The titles begin with The Case of the .... Some stories were copied from the novels (but are of lower quality).

Thus far, we have seen the entire first series, mission logs for that one and the first two episodes of Series 2. All  discs seen up to this communication ran problem-free. My only complaint was the horrendous condition regarding the  packaging of the DVDs. The green plastic holders were chipped and cracked so badly, I had to go to Best Buy and purchase a 50 case box of replacement DVD cases in order to protect the DVDs in the set. I then made my own identification sticker labels for them to permit easy access for each disc.  I would like to be reimbursed for that purchase which came to around $27.00 with the tax.

Episode 21 - Twice-Told Twist is in colour - the only episode all those years that was. The colour is saturated but there.

Episode 30 - The Case of the Final Fadeout (last episode of the series) involved a murder that occurred on a film set. As part of the investigation, the film staff identified themselves to the authorities as potential witnesses.  The film staff were in fact the same tv film staff working on the Perry Mason set and they used their real names and occupations. This episode also included Erle Stanley Gardner himself acting as the judge in the courtroom scene.  It was the only one in which he appeared.

I can see why viewers tired of the series.  The final two years, some of the stories were just plain hokey.  The music is moody, the action was melodramatic, some stories were non-sequiter.  However, it's still Perry Mason and Raymond Burr (with his tremendous bulk, weighing close to 300 pounds) still carries it off.  I continue to watch this disk over and over.  It's better than ANYTHING on TV.

On a sidenote, I saw on old episode of Jack Benny and Raymond Burr was the guest.  He did some dancing and other skits.  It was amazing to see how light on his feet he was at his size and weight.

It was nice to see the color comment by Barbara Hale introducing the color episode, but it would have been helpful to know when she taped it, and it was far too short. A very lovely lady. All viewers would likely have welcomed a much longer ""visit"" with her than was provided.

The rest of the episodes (all in black and white) were up to the usual standards; and we are pleased to now have our set of Perry Masons complete.

5725232,3,B00CL0MCN0,"Who doesn't laugh when DA Hamilton Burger says: ""I hope Mr. Mason doesn't intend to waste the court's time by going on one of his fishing expeditions!""
I love pretty much every season of Perry Mason, but this one is a bit weird! As the show's stars aged gracefully, the producers
decided to focus on youth culture. So the episodes have teenagers, British pop-stars, Dick Clark, shyster talent managers, coffee houses replete with '60's dancing, motorcycles, fast cars, & surfing references. Raymond Burr is still the greatest, however he has gained considerable weight & his hair has been plastered down on his head. If anything, he looks like he's preparing for the infinitely-inferior ""Ironsides"" series.

While it's interesting to see the one episode shot in color, I feel it's perhaps the worst show of all 9 seasons.
Of course, pandering to a younger audience, it deals with juvenile delinquents & car theft. The whole thing feels strained & Perry & Della seem out of place in a pedestrian teen drama. The other episode people either love or despise is the one where Raymond Burr plays Perry Mason, & also a drunken, loud seaman, as a kind of doppleganger. I find this episode incredibly tiresome w/ hammy overacting, but it is amusing. Luckily, there are several episodes that involve the adult world (& better-quality, experienced actors). The golf club episode is a thing of malicious beauty. I guess if the show had gone another season, they would have had The Monkees & riots on the Sunset Strip. Though I love the late '60's, that world does not work in the more film noir B&W world of Perry Mason. Though unrealistic & with a repetitive formula involving last-minute courtroom confessions, PM is/was one of the best shows ever on television, due to the lead actors chemistry, guest character actors, the lighting, sets & locations. So glad to have 270 episodes to watch throughout my life.

If you get a sense of deja-vu watching this season, it's because about one third of the episodes are re-makes of episodes from the first two seasons.",1379635200,4,2052,4.86

It is a daily ritual with my husband and me to get hot coffee and dark chocolate every morning at 10:00 to watch Perry and crew!  As many times as we have watched, (I own all of the seasons), we rarely remember who did it!  Perry Mason---a real quality show!",1379462400,4,425,4.072289156626506

5725240,5,B00CL0MCN0,The last of the Perry Mason series and I own all nine seasons. Fun to watch the actors change in time. Sad at the lost of Ray Collins as Lt. Tragg.

End of a great series. But I still watch back to the first year and enjoy.,1379030400,2,412,3.9759036144578315

Included in this set is  ""The Case of the Dead Ringer"", with Raymond Burr in a duel role as a ""blimey"" seaman who poses as Perry himself to incriminate Mason for bribery before the court. Watch as Perry once again, aided by the faithful Della Street and Paul Drake, turns the tables on the guilty and win another case.

5725249,5,B00CL0MCN0,"As this series closes out, I fondly remember the entire cast and the wonderful lineup of guest stars who graced the screen during the run of this series. Some of the stories in Season 9 are better than others.  But that's usual for any series. Nevertheless it's always a pleasure to watch. Some of the most versatile character actors made multiple appearances throughout the series run. The guest stars who filled in for Raymond Burr (Bette Davis, Walter Pidgeon, Mike Connors, Michael Rennie, Hugh O'Brien, Barry Sullivan) were a treat. One of the special moments  in the series was when Della asked Perry ""How far would you go for a friend?""  And Perry replied, ""How long is forever?""  Nice. All in all, it's worth having the entire series in my collection.",1377302400,8,759,4.770992366412214
5725250,5,B00CL0MCN0,"September 12th 2013 will mark the 20th anniversary of the death of Raymond Burr, so it is entirely apposite that the last of the Perry Mason box sets will have been brought out to coincide with that date. Throughout the DVD release programme, one of the highlights has been the pristine quality of the prints (possibly accounting for the fairly high price of the sets). But in the final analysis we now have a superb complete record of one of the most successful of all American TV series, and people who 'grew up with' the show will surely not begrudge the fact that the project is now completed and can be sampled at leisure.

With regard to this final season, a special mention should be made of Richard Anderson, who joined the cast as Lieutenant Steve Drumm. This fine actor, such a familiar star and guest-star in TV series from the 1960s onwards, always offered a thoughtful, dignified and serious presence in all his appearances, yet has never really received full credit for his contribution to the success of post-war American TV, so it was entirely fitting that he should have been chosen to play a part in the concluding season of this most iconic of series, when he was in the prime of his distinguished career.

By now it should be clear that this is a 'must-have' recommendation. Enthusiasts of the show will, of course, waste no time in completing their collection, and, despite some quibbles about the pricing which have been registered over the years (noted earlier), Paramount should be commended for eventually giving us the complete 'official edition'.",1377302400,41,1573,4.800738007380073
