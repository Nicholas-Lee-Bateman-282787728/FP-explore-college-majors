I watch and love a lot of bad movies. If they were all as good as Deathstalker (found on this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roger-Corman-s-Cult-Classics-Sword-And-Sorcery-Collection-Deathstalker-Deathstalker-II-The-Warrior-And-The-Sorceress-Barbarian-Queen/dp/B004ZKKKXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roger Corman's Cult Classics Sword And Sorcery Collection (Deathstalker, Deathstalker II, The Warrior And The Sorceress & Barbarian Queen)</a>)... dreaming.",1446854400,,730,7.202247191011236

8157933,4,B000BSHV8A,"This movie is okay at best. It is fascinating to watch a young Del Zamora in this action ""B"" movie. Del is the only actor really worth watching, though the gang leader in the abandoned building was also good. The other lead actor, a hulking awkward Black man, is not that good. He is stiff. The music is mediocre. The photography is good. The actress who plays Del Zamora's wife is also good. Overall, this movie is okay. I like it, but I like most everything. I think most of you out there will consider it a ""C"" movie, at best.",1254960000,2,529,4.247524752475248
