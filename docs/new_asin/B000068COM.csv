7993428,5,B000068COM,"As mentioned in previous reviews, the ""3 peice head"" video is the same as the ""Nip and Tuck"" video, save for the different approaches to building the head. However, I would like to add that the ""3 Peice Head"" video does have a bit more information when it comes to covering your puppet with other materials, such as fur, felt, or fleece...where as the ""nip and tuck"" video doesn't go into this in detail (though they do talk about painting the foam, etc).

If you're just starting out (as I am, though I bought both videos and the book)...you may want the 3-peice head video first, because there's more of a formula to follow. Also, if you're looking to make Muppet-esque puppets, I think this video lends itself more to that style. Both videos are great, however, and I highly recommend them. The book is also nice to have when you need easy access to information, but don't want to spend the time fast-forwarding and rewinding the video.",1141344000,2,939,4.589285714285714
7993429,4,B000068COM,"This is a very helpful video. Great information to get you started building your own polyfoam puppets. Great tips for heads hands and bodies. I also have their three piece head method video. However, the two videos are EXACTLY the same except for the title, credits and head construction information being edited in. Which was dissapointing but, would allow either to be stand alone videos.

So buy both. But, be warned that if you've watched one of them, you've seen most of the other.

I wish it was on DVD with both head construction styles edited in with the other great information.",1128729600,2,587,4.745098039215686

7993431,5,B000068COM,"Thanks to Drew Allison for a wonderfully unique puppet building experience.  If you'd like to make a foam puppet of your own with lots of character,  ""Nip and Tuck"" is for you.  Clear step by step instructions demystify the process of creating imaginative and unusual puppet faces.  Several body construction styles are also shown that include torso, arms, legs, hands and feet. What a great way to play and experiment with the puppet building process.  The one Drew builds on the video is among the best of all he displays - and you get to watch the entire process, clearly explained and demonstrated.  You can't NOT want to build a puppet after this.",1059350400,6,652,4.725663716814159
7993432,5,B000068COM,"If you are longing to build your own foam puppet, this video will save you untold hours of frustration.  Drew Allison is not only an excellent puppet builder but a gifted teacher as well.  Begins with a complete display of materials needed and proceeds with clear step by step procedures from head to toe - literally. Don't forget to check out the ""Nip and Tuck"" video as well.  Both are fun to watch as well as instructive.  Would love to see these videos on DVD.",1059350400,3,464,4.423529411764706
7993433,5,B000068COM,The Foam Book Video: Three Piece Head Method is a great companion or stand alone to the printed version. It covers the three piece head section of the foam book itself. The material is presented in a clear and consise manner with tips and tricks thrown in to make your puppet creating life much easier. If I had one gripe it is that some of the more advanced features aren't quite as detailed as they could have been but it is still a great video with or without the printed version of the book.,1026345600,6,495,4.276595744680851
