8735564,5,B01648PAY2,I have written reviews of Word World before. This was one of the BEST early reading programs ever but sadly was discontinued several years ago. A big error in judgement!! Every episode is great and you will never regret purchasing them. I am a retired teacher and cannot recommend them more highly.,1487030400,,298,4.75
8735565,5,B01648PAY2,I saw a recommendation for Word World on a review from another parent on another N Circle children's dvd. So I decided to get a Word Wirld dvd for my 1.5 year old. He loves it and I feel like he may even be learning from the dvd. 4 episodes on the dvd. About an hour long dvd or close. Very entertaining and educational.  Only 1 episode is related to valentines day while the rest are normal episodes.,1476489600,,401,4.141025641025641

8735568,4,B01648PAY2,"This DVD features five episodes featuring word fun. The show is a great way for kids to learn letters and how to form words, I still think it is how both my boys learned their first words. The characters are adorable and letters form what they are called - seriously its an adorable show. We never catch Word World on television anymore but this gives my kids a chance to still enjoy these silly characters. One episode is Valentine's Day themed but the rest are for everyday.

Episodes include:

My Fuzzy Valentine
Love, Bug
Sh-Sh-Shark
Princess Sheep
There's an Ant in Every Giant

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1454716800,,656,4.637931034482759
