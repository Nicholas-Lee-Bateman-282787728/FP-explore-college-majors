7858806,4,6304005776,"When you consider that over the course of the 4 Highlander films and 2 live-action series, the Highlander continuity has been thrown into complete disarry, can it hurt to add another storyline? Not when its as well crafted as this! Although abandoning all connections to previous Highlander incarnations, this beautifully designed show, with its wonderfully developed characters, is as appealing to adults as to kids, (I used to watch it with my Nan!). Of course, the film's notion of beheading is removed from this family show, (its a cartoon, after all!), and replaced with the clever idea of passing on each Immortals' power through the taking of a special oath. Perfect for kids (and adults who are too laid-back to nit-pick).The 3-D effect used in certain episodes is amazing, as is the emotive music. The characters have depth and look great, and so long as you enjoy the show for what it is and don't try to compare it to (or connect it with) the films or other shows, this makes for great viewing. Highly recommended!",1002844800,9,1025,4.829545454545454
7858807,2,6304005776,"1st 4 episodes of the kids' cartoon edited into a feature length video that kids may enjoy but any real Highlander fan should have nothing to do with. Story hardly worth mentioning, just Quentin MacLeod, the last MacLeod  destined to be the one to rid the land of the tyranny of the evil Kortan.  Of course contradicts its predecessors (and eventually its succesors as  well) but who really cares this is just a silly kiddie show anyway. It  would've been a lot better to see a Highlander animated series more along  the lines of anime or the HBO Spawn series, or atleast the Batman animated  series, but this drivel? I mean there's more action in Teletubies (OK I'm  exaggerating a little--but only a little). Oh well what do you expect from  the movie that has a long history of horrible sequels. However the later  episodes in the series weren't nearly as bad, to say the least.",915148800,2,881,4.596153846153846
