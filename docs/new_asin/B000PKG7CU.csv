I decided to keep it, when I saw it was interesting as well. So, it has become a funny item in my collection, with ""They live by night / Side street"" on the cover, and ""Where danger lives / Tension"" in the interior.",1208131200,,382,4.2465753424657535

Co-written and directed by Nicholas Ray. An escapee falls in love with a young girl, marries her and tries to reach a place where he could start a new life. Nicholas Ray's first movie is a one of a kind film noir that should be in every movie lover's library. The director is more interested in the description of the relation between Cathy O'Donnell and Farley Granger than in the usual film noir clichs; for instance, note that none of the two bank heists are shown to us.

2824511,4,B000PKG7CU,"""They Live By Night"" and ""Side Street"" are film noirs in which ordinary, flawed men try to extricate themselves from a web of crime and deceit created by their own momentary foolishness. In both cases, the protagonist is pursued by both the law and the hoodlums. ""They Live By Night"" was shelved for 2 years before it could get a US release, but both films were made under the aegis of executive producer Dore Schary, first at RKO, then at MGM. They both pair actors Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell as sympathetic, if nave, young couples hurting for money. Curiously, both films establish the narrative's sympathy for its acutely imprudent protagonist from the outset, by means of a prologue or voiceover. I wonder if that is Schary's political activism at work.

""They Live By Night"" (RKO 1948) is based on Edward Anderson's novel ""Thieves Like Us"", adapted for the screen by director Nicholas Ray. Three ""lifers"" break out of a prison farm. The career criminals T-Dub (Jay C. Flippen) and Chickamaw (Howard Da Silva) bring Bowie (Farley Granger), an enthusiastic but nave young convict, with them, intending that he be their driver on bank heists. The threesome take temporary refuge with T-Dub's brother and niece Keechie (Cathy O'Donnell). Keechie barely hides her distaste for the thugs but is attracted to the sweet and handsome Bowie. Bowie hopes that they can live well and in peace with his share of a bank job, and the couple run away together. But the police and his partners in crime have other ideas.

Some of the first shots in this film are of a car on a country road photographed from a helicopter. There are more aerial shots later in the story, also of a car. These may have the first helicopter shots to follow a particular object in a commercial film. The storyline is a basic ""fugitive couple"" variety, on the run with brief interludes of bliss. It has a Depression-era feel, as that's when the novel was written. But ""They Live By Night"" is distinguished by the extraordinary authenticity of the everyday life scenes and its compassion for two young people on the fringes of society. Rural, poor, not very bright, and from strange, isolated backgrounds, Keechie and Bowie are the extreme of Southern white trash and perhaps too ignorant to realize it.

""Side Street"" (MGM 1950) gives the initial impression of a police procedural but is a thriller revolving around a genial mailman sucked into the world of thugs and floozies on account of one moral lapse. Joe Norson (Farley Granger) has recently lost his business and had to move his family in with his in-laws. Doing the rounds one day as a part-time mail carrier, Joe sees a man in a law office stash $200 in a filing cabinet. The next time he delivers mail to that office, he steals a file containing the money, hoping to save his pregnant wife (Cathy O'Donnell) the indignity of delivering their baby in a public clinic. But the file actually contains $30,000, the loot from a blackmail and murder scheme. Now the crooked lawyer's sociopathic henchman Georgie (James Craig) and the police are after him.

This film also opens with a helicopter shot, a breathtaking straight-down view of Manhattan. A car chase near the end of film is one of the few I've seen in New York City, also shot partly from a helicopter, and it is pretty spectacular. ""Side Street"" spends a lot of time on the streets of New York and is a wonderful document by cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg of how the city looked mid-century. The style is docudrama. The title may refer to the archetypal, inconspicuous working class family that lives down many a street and whose frustrations engender Joe's predicament and the audience's sympathy. Joe doesn't begin in the underworld, but flees to the noir world of betrayal, dark alleys, nightclubs, and chaos in order to track that money down.

The DVD (Warner 2007): There are no scene selection menus. Both films have an audio commentary and featurette. ""Side Street"" also has a theatrical trailer. ""They Live By Night: The Twisted Road"" (6 min) interviews film critics, film noir scholars, and Oliver Stone about the film and its themes. The audio commentary for ""They Live By Night"" is by film noir historian Eddie Muller and actor Farley Granger. They discuss how the film made it to the screen, its delayed release, Ray's direction, the camera work. Granger shares his memory of making the movie. ""Side Street: Where Temptation Lies"" (6 min) interviews critics and others about Anthony Mann, the cinematography, and themes. The audio commentary for Side Street"" is by Richard Schinkel, who discusses the photography, characters, actors, director, screenwriter, and story. Subtitles are available for both films in English SDH and French.",1197936000,17,4741,4.891791044776119
2824512,4,B000PKG7CU,"According to Silver and Ward's encyclopedic ""Film Noir"", MGM bought Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell together again in ""Side Street"" to capitalize on the success of ""They Live By Night"". The two films are distinctly dissimilar. TLN is dark and gloomy, shot in rural locations, often at night, with the ending predictable. SS is better lit, accents distinct New York City daytime locales and maintains suspense to the end.  While both feature the vulnerable young couple (Granger and O'Donnell), TLN is highly emotional.  SS is strangely detached, even including a police narration (!) with an air of a semi-documentary. In both O'Donnell and Granger are 2 good people in a distinctly hostile world where young folks get few breaks. Both releases feature tough criminals but the black hats in TLN are harder cases. In each film, Granger commits a foolish crime when the viewer ""knows"" he is not a hardcore bad guy.  Nicolas Ray maintains a more even pace over 95 minutes in TLN while Anthony Mann forces a frenetic atmosphere over just 83 minutes for SS. Mann also includes 68 (!) characters. Why? There are key scenes: TLN has that scene in the bus station diner that is pure genius. SS shines when a desperate Granger tries to return the stolen loot only to find he can't! One movie has a vastly happier resolution than the other, but a good review would never divulge! One complaint: How does Granger seem so clean in SS just after being beaten up?  Didn't his scars heal rather quickly?  This reviewer recommends both releases to noir fans but gives the nod to ""They Live By Night"". Mr. Ray simply maintains a more consistent motif. This reviewer believes that Mr. Mann could have let ""Side Street"" safely run 90 minutes, allowing the viewer to stay even with the action rather than racing to keep up with it. SS ends with a wheeling police chase through lower Manhattan, ending at the Stock Exchange. Natives will recognize that it was timed for an early Sunday or holiday morning when no one was in the streets. It would have been a trip for Mann to shoot that during a busy weekday!",1192060800,3,2090,4.730769230769231
2824513,4,B000PKG7CU,"Nicholas Ray's directoral debut,  ""THE LIVE BY NIGHT"" (1948) is a poignant, noirish love story not unlike the much later  ""BONNIE AND CLYDE.""

But the real gem in this double-feature DVD is Anthony Mann's ""SIDE STREET"" (1949), a gritty, compelling, crime drama that is a true film noir.

 It follows the downward spiral of sympathetic, naive and desperate Farley Granger -- a letter carrier with a pregnant wife -- after he steals some money from a pair of very bad guys.  Granger stashes the money with a ""friend"" and then decides to give it back -- but the friend has hit the road with the loot.  The bad guys Granger stole from aren't amused.  They are unrelenting in their pursuit of Granger.

The movie goes all the way with the premis. There's a terrific, extended, car chase that is strikingly photographed, perhaps a first of it's kind in a drama and clearly a model for the one in ""BULLET.""

This is a satisfying, taught film with beautifully composed, stark, BW location cinematography in lower Manhattan that perfectly matches the story.  Location as metaphor!  Highly recommended.",1185062400,18,1092,4.8432432432432435
2824534,4,B000PKG7CU,"The doomed lovers theme is an old one, especially common in film noir, but these two films cast them as young orphans, in a sense, that you can't help but sympathize with, even when Granger is ripping people off and being generally sociopathic. O'Donnel and Granger are a slightly odd couple with a palpable chemistry; O'Donnell's vulnerability is perfect for her part. And well, Farley Granger is about the sexiest male film noir lead this side of Robert Mitchum. (both are about the sexiest of all time, really) Get it!",1337299200,,521,4.8
2824535,4,B000PKG7CU,"Usually crime noir does not have an overriding social message, well, except the old chestnut that crime doesn't pay, although for the rich a little maybe. Otherwise the genre back in the days, especially in the 1940s be-bop heyday of the genre, was pretty much police procedural stuff, and get the handcuffs out. Or maybe, every once in a while a stray femme fatale came carrying her scent and her sway across the room and turned some otherwise rational guy a little screwy. And anyone, any guy anyway, except maybe that screwy guy, will tell you that is just par for the course. And then get the handcuffs out. A film like the one under review, They Live By Night (a little over the top title by the way, bringing out visions of weird aliens, the space kind, or all night sex and drug romps), however, perhaps a little more melodramatically than necessary, tries to break some moral ground as well. And that proposition as presented in the film was none too pretty, then or now. Basically that once one runs down the criminal road, alone or with help, young or old, maybe even guilty or not guilty, the doors to salvation (read: rehabilitation in penal lingo) are closed. Ouch!

And the plot line and unfolding characterizations as the story proceeds go a long way toward driving that hard, if perhaps questionable, premise home. Bowie (played with a studied unworldly naivet&eacute; and socially immature confusion by a young Farley Granger) is a young lifer, the details of his imprisonment, except that he came from a broken home and was on his own early in life, do not concern us except to form the underlying basis for his eternal damnation. Wrong step number one. He broke, and was consciously broken, out of the big house along with and by a couple of very nasty career criminals. Wrong step number two. In gratitude, and frankly because he had developed a certain criminal panache while in stir, he aided the pair as the driver of the getaway cars when they went, naturally since they were not going to work in some diner for dimes and doughnuts, on a robbery spree to keep them in clover. And he got his share of the take, no questions asked. Not much to be sympathetic about. So far.

Here is where things get dicey. During the getaway part of the great jail break-out the trio was helped by one the career banditos' brother (said bandito played by Howard DaSilva, a guy you do not want to cross, ever, especially if unarmed. Yes, especially if unarmed). And the brother, of course, had a daughter, Kee Kee (played just a little too naively and dreamily by Catherine O'Donnell), a young daughter a little unworldly in the world of fringe lumpen crime. Alone with a two-bit drunken father (and long gone mom) Naturally a young, good-looking and spirited criminal guy (who does those bank jobs just to get some dough to get himself straight with the law as he tells it to her later) and a young nave, kind of tomboyish girl (although through the magic of cinema she gets to be pretty fetching by the end of the film), both socially immature and both desperate to find their place, some place, some small happy place in a world that they did not make, are ""made"" for each other. And that is where the moral part of the story comes.

By a process of elimination by the middle of the film Bowie and Kee Kee are trying, trying fitfully but trying, to break out of the old crime wave pattern and have little white picket fence  existence, if not here maybe down Mexico way where the living is cheap, once Bowie gets straight with the law. But that fantasy was not to be. Bowie was forced (remember what I said about Howard DaSilva) to do that one hold-up job too many and the pair had to go on the lam. Wrong step number three. You already know what that means. They had dough, and each other, but the cards were stacked against them as no one will help them slip down Sonora way.

In the end, the lonely end, one of the banditos' kin (on the other bandito's side) ""dime's"" on him. There is more background to it like the kids getting off-handedly married, a no bells and whistles ceremony by the way, learning about sex enough in their wanderings to conceive a child, and desperately try to hang onto their cardboard dreams of a normal life. But the fate sisters were not kind, not this trip. Like I said, a little on the melodramatic pledging eternal love every other minute high side but a story that I could relate to having come within about two minutes of such a fate myself. Actually make that about one minute.",1331164800,,4523,4.5244498777506115
2824536,3,B000PKG7CU,"""They Live By Night"" (1948) and ""Side Street"" (1950) feature the twin pairings of Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnel  in early film noir. For those of you unfamiliar with the term, ""film noir"" refers to a film genre with certain stylistic (night shots, rain, shadow) and plot (femme fatale, ordinary person makes a bad choice, fatalistic ending) conventions. Film noir had its roots in German expressionism and films like ""The Blue Angel"" (1929) and ""M"" (1931) as well as American gangster films like ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1931) and ""Scarface"" (1932). Following WW 2, American films reached France where the audiences had a chance to watch several films together. When they saw ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""Laura"" (1944), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944) and ""Window in the Window"" (1944), they coined the term ""film noir"" to refer to films that highlighted the seamy side of life and carried a cynical message.

Farley Granger (1925 -) made his film debut in 1943 (""North Star"") and is best known for his work with Alfred Hitchcock in ""Rope"" (1948) and ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951). He made dozens of films before transitioning to TV where he continued to work until 2001. In his autobiography he said ""They Live By Night"" was his favorite film along with ""Strangers on a Train"".

Cathy O'Donnell (1923-70) is little remembered today, but in the 40s and 50s she was a busy actress in films like ""Detective Story"" (1951) and ""The Man From Laramie"" (1955). I remember her best as the wife of the double amputee in ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946) although she is celebrated for her 7 film noir roles.

""They Live By Night"" is the prototype of the ""couple on the run"" films of which ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967) and ""Badlands"" (1973) are the most famous. It is Nicholas Ray's (1911-79) first film as a director, and as such it probably has been reviewed more favorably than it deserves. Ray is best known for ""Rebel  Without a Cause"" (1956) for which he received an Oscar nomination. He also received a Cannes Film Festival nomination for ""The Savage Innocents"" (1960) and Venice Film Festival nominations for ""Bitter Victory"" (1957) and ""Bigger than Life"" (1956). My absolute favorite Ray film is the western ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954). But none of Ray's considerable skills are on view in this 1948 film, although as a first effort it is impressive.

Ray was consumed with the theme of love and especially young love, and equally enthralled by the role of the rebel. One can view ""They Live By Night"" as a darker version of ""Rebel  Without a Cause"".

""They Live By Night"" was inspired by a 1937 novel called ""Thieves Like Us"" (a re-make of this film by Robert Altman in 1974 used the original title). That novel, in turn, was inspired by the true life story of Bonnie and Clyde, which launched its own series of films.

The cast of characters includes Howard Da Silva and Jay C Flippen.

Howard DaSilva plays a one eyed psychopath. He appeared in more than 60 films, and gave memorable performances as Ben Franklin in ""1776"" (1972), FDR in ""Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover"" (1983), and Khruschev in ""The Missles of October"" (1974).

Jay C. Flippen appeared in nearly 100 films, often with James Stewart (""Winchester 73"", ""Strategic Air Command"", ""The Restless Breed"") and John Wayne (""Jet Pilot"", ""Hellfighters""). In the 60s he turned to TV where he appeared in dozens of westerns.

The sparse production can be credited to John Houseman who learned economy working with Orson Welles. Houseman had been heavily involved in several Orson Welles' productions and learned how to spend frugally. Following World War 2 Houseman turned his attention to production and made nearly 20 films, including ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1945), ""On Dangerous Ground"" (1952) also directed by Ray, ""Julius Caesar"" (1953) and ""Lust for Life"" (1956).

George Diskant is the cinematographer. Diskant worked with Houseman and Ray in 1952's ""On Dangerous Ground"". Diskant has several film noirs to his credit, including ""Port of New York"" (1949), ""The Racket"" (1951) and ""Beware my Lovely"" (1952). He turned to TV in the 50s and worked on Peckinpah's ""The Westerner"" as well as ""Rifleman.""

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther called it A commonplace little story... told with pictorial sincerity and uncommon emotional thrust."" He praised the ""good, realistic production and sharp direction by Nicholas Ray"" and said that Granger ""gives a genuine sense of nervous strain and is wistful and appealing.""

Although Farley Granger lists ""The Live By Night"" as one of his favorite films, and while it has been praised by Francois Truffaut as Ray's best movie, I'm at a loss to see what they see. The film skates the boundaries of film noir, but never really settles in. The cinematography is interesting, but never really challenges you. There is a motley cast of characters, but they are generally on screen for too short a time to make much of an impact. All things considered, this is a good film for a first time director, but beyond that, it has limited appeal.

""Side Street"" features Granger and O'Donnell in a film directed by Anthony Mann and produced by Sam Zimbalist.

Granger plays a gas station attendant who steals $200 from a lawyer's office to pay for the new expenses for his pregnant wife (O'Donnell), but it turns out he stole $30,000 which is part of a scheme involving extortion and a sex scandals. This sets in motion a series of events involving multiple murders, double crosses, femme fatales, and a relentless police investigator.

The cast includes Paul Kelly, King Donovan, and Harry Bellaver.

Grim Paul Kelly (1899-1956) plays the detective. He started in the silent film days and made more than 100 films between 1911 and 1957. He's best known for playing Warden Duffy in ""Duffy of San Quenton"" (1954) which is kind of curious since Kelly served 2 years for manslaughter (1927-9), but I remember him best as the determined man in ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954).

Harry Bellaver (1905-93) plays a cab driver, a role he also played in ""The House on 92nd Street"". Bellaver started in films in 1938 and made dozens of films. He's best remembered as Detective Frank Arcaro from ""Naked City"" (1958-63).

Square jawed James Craig (1912-85) plays an ex con. He appeared in more than 50 films and was most popular in the 40s when he appeared in ""Kitty Foyle"" (1940), ""The Human Comedy"" (1943), and""Kismet"" (1944).

Anthony Mann (1906-67) was nominated 3 times by the DGA (""El Cid"", ""Men in War"", ""The Glenn Miller Story""). He directed 44 films between 1939 and 1968 and is best remembered for his work in film noir and in western, especially the ones he made with Jimmy Stewart in the 50s. Many of Mann's film have a strong tendency toward sadism.

Joseph Ruttenberg (1889-1983) was nominated for an Oscar 10 times and won 4 times - ""The Great Waltz"" (1938), ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942), ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" (1952), and ""Gigi"" (1958). Personally I preferred ""Gaslight"" (1944).

The NY Times called it ""a fair enough crime picture"" and praised Granger ""who makes a vividly terrorized lad,"" but said ""it can only be fully recommended to those who have a deep and morbid interest in crime."" The film is notable for its on location shooting in New York and a chase scene that remains one of the screen's finest.

There are a plethora of film noir movies from the late 40s and early 50s. My personal favorites are ""DOA"" (1949) with Edmund O'Brien, ""The Killers"" (1946) with Burt Lancaster in his film debut, ""Sorry Wrong Number"" (1948) with Barbara Stanwyck, Nic Ray's ""In a Lonely Place"" (1950)  with Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame, ""Angel Face"" (1953) with Jean Simmons and Robert Mitchum.

The packaging of these two Granger/O'Donnell films may not be the best representatives of the film noir of this period, but it is interesting to see the two actors paired in the same genre so close to each other.",1309564800,8,7921,4.835181079083518

2824538,5,B000PKG7CU,"Warner Home Video presents ""THEY LIVE BY NIGHT & SIDE STREET"" (1948/1950) (177 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- This classic film noir collection contains a double feature pairing RKO's They Live By Night and MGM's Side Street, both starring Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell.

Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe Hollywood crime dramas that set their protagonists in a world perceived as inherently corrupt and unsympathetic -- Hollywood's classic film noir period is generally regarded as stretching from the early 1940s to the late 1950s -- Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography, while many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Depression -- the term film noir (French for ""black film""), first applied to Hollywood movies by French critic Nino Frank in 1946, was unknown to most of the American filmmakers and actors while they were creating the classic film noirs -- the canon of film noir was defined in retrospect by film historians and critics; many of those involved in the making of film noir later professed to be unaware at the time of having created a distinctive type of film.

First up we have ""THEY LIVE BY NIGHT"" (1948) (95 min. B/W) -- Starring Farley Granger, Cathy O'Donnell, Howard Da Silva, Jay C. Flippen & Helen Craig -- Directed by Nicholas Ray

In the '30s, three prisoners flee from a state prison farm in Mississippi. Among them is 23-years-young Bowie, who spent the last seven years in prison and now hopes to be able to prove his innocence or retire to a home in the mountains and live in peace together with his new love, Kitty. But his criminal companions persuade him to participate in several heists, and soon the police believe him to be their leader and go after ""Bowie the Kid"" harder than ever.

They Live by Night has since gained stature as one of the most sensitive and least-predictable entries in the film noir genre. The film was based on a novel by Edward Anderson, and was director Nicholas Ray's first feature.

2824539,5,B000PKG7CU,"THEY LIVE BY NIGHT is an impressive film, even moreso when one considers that it was Nicholas Ray's directorial debut.  It emphasizes romantic love, or perhaps the desperate, ill-fated attempt of romantic love to win out in a noirish universe.  There isn't too much in the noir canon like it; at least nothing that springs readily to mind, perhaps bits of Frank Borzage's MOONRISE (1948).  There was definitely no borrowing from MOONRISE though, as THEY LIVE BY NIGHT was actually completed in 1947, and left unreleased until 1949.  It was held up because Howard Hughes was in the process of buying the struggling RKO.

The first scene Ray ever shot professionally, involved the ground-breaking use of a helicopter to capture an action scene.  As the opening credits role, we see this scene.  It depicts the three convicts (Bowie (Farley Granger), Chickamaw (Howard Da Silva), and T-Dub (Jay C. Flippen)) fleeing in a stolen car.  And Ray was wise enough to insert a tender ethereal scene of the two young lovers (Bowie and Keechie (Cathy O'Donnell)), to begin the film.  It emphasizes both the serenity of the first moments, and the movement and vitality of what follows.

The story revolves around Bowie, who was imprisoned at 16 for his part in a robbery that also involved a murder.  He, and the much older Chickamaw and T-Dub have broken out of prison together.  Bowie has an extremely weak character, and he is rather naive.  Though he wants to clear his name, instead he gets into more trouble ... robbing banks, and being again involved with murder.  He attempts to run away with Keechie; to flee from both the police and Chickamaw and T-Dub. But he finds that it isn't so easy to do.

SIDE STREET was made in 1950 by MGM. Apparently, the leads were reunited due to the success of the 1949 release of THEY LIVE BY NIGHT.  Again, Granger's character (Joe Norson) gives in to weakness.  Norson is a part-time mail carrier who, in a moment of temptation, breaks into a filing cabinet with an axe.  He believes there are a few hundred dollars being stored there by a lawyer.  But what he gets is $30,000.  Unknown to Norson, it is a blackmail payment.  When he tries to pay the money back, and fails to do so, the criminal element comes calling.  By this time, the police also become aware of the situation, and it becomes a bit of a race to find Norson.  A chase ensues, which culminates in one of the most exciting, and well-filmed (all on location in New York City by cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg) finales captured on celluloid.  A triumph for director Anthony Mann.

The films are a bargain on this single DVD, which can be purchased as a single or in the Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 4.  My only complaint about the extras, which are plentiful, is that Farley Granger did not have more to say on the THEY LIVE BY NIGHT commentary.  The image and audio are fine; they could use a future restoration, but are not bad enough to complain about, in my opinion.",1283299200,4,2975,4.649425287356322
2824540,5,B000PKG7CU,"This is a review for the film noir double feature DVD of
the movies THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT and SIDE STREET.  Both films
star Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell in memorable performances.

THEY LIVE BY NIGHT is Nicholas Ray's film directing debut
and SIDE STREET is on of Anthony Mann's earlier lesser known films
but no less adroit than his famous film series with James Stewart.

THEY LIVE BY NIGHT is the more sensational of the two films, being
something of a Bonnie & Clyde-like movie but SIDE STREET certainly

THEY LIVE BY NIGHT. (1949) concerns  three convicted murders who escape from their rural prison
and go on a crime spree involving the no account brother of one of the cons along with his doe eyed daughter, played by Cathy O'Donnell,
who eventually gets romantically involved with the youngest of the convicts, played by Farley Granger.  Neither one has any actual social experience and young love blooms on the run while each of the older convicts meets his fate. From then on THEY LIVE BY NIGHT is all about the youngest con who realizes way too late that his hope for a pardon escaped with the jail break.
Both Farley Granger and especially Cathy O'Donnell bring a lot of pathos to their roles because both  their characters believe that what they are doing is their only chance to have a life for themselves.

Based on Edward Anderson's Depression era classic novel, ""Thieves Like Us."" A fine film, a fine book,
worth seeing and reading. With Farley Granger, Cathy O'Donnell, Jay C. Flippen, Howard daSilva, Will Wright, Helen Craig.

SIDE STREET (1950) Joe Norson, played by Farley Granger, is a part time letter carrier who wants more money to pay for his pregnant wife's medical bills .  When Joe comes across what he thinks is a file  folder with $200 he steals it only to find out a little later that he has a folder with $30,000 in it. He quickly wraps it up to look like a gift and gives it to a local bartender to hold for him for a week or so.
Upon return Joe discovers that the bar has been sold, and they only have a package that looks like the one with the $30, 000. so Joe plays detective and searches for the bartender, former owner and gets into
an even bigger mess with the original ""owners"" of the $30,000, blackmailers and murders,  climaxing in one spectacular shootout/ car chase
on the streets of New York City.

SIDE STREET is a really well done film, beautifully shot mostly on location in 1950 NYC with excellent performances by Farley Granger, Cathy O'Donnell, James Craig, Paul Harvey, and especially Jean Hagen.
SIDE STREET boasts top flight direction from Anthony Mann and fine work by cnematographer Joesph Ruttenberg.

I can't recommend either film highly enough and give the whole package five stars
without hesitation..",1282867200,5,2830,4.645290581162325
2824541,4,B000PKG7CU,"Here are two movies on one disc that both feature Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell.  They're pretty good, too!

THEY LIVE BY NIGHT  -  This was the first pairing of Granger and O'Donnell and it was successful enough so that the two worked together two years later in ""Side Street,"" the other movie on this DVD, which is part of a film noir set.

Granger and O'Donnell didn't really dominate the screen until after 40 minutes but after that, it was mostly them. Frankly, I enjoyed the first 40 minutes best when Howard da Silva and J.C. Flippen shared the screen time. They were great film noir characters in this movie (and they did come back in the second half, livening up the film again.) I liked their names in here: da Silva was ""Chicamaw."" and Flippen was ""T-Dub."" In most of the second half of this movie, it went from a noir to a romance. but that's not surprising knowing the director was Nicholas Ray.

O'Donnell is impressive here with a fine performance and a nice '40s look to her. She had a strange character name, too: ""Keechie.""  Granger (""Arthur Bowers"") does a nice job, too. For an uneducated thug, he sure comes across as a really nice guy. He reminded me of John Dall in ""Gun Crazy"" (1950). Some of the camera-work also reminded me of ""Gun Crazy.""

Like a lot of good film noirs, this also has some very good supporting actors who play weird people, and say weird things. Some of the dialogue in this movie is fascinating because it's so odd. One example is the guy who marries the couple for $20. Another is Keechie's father. This is a odd little ""B"" noir/melodrama and definitely one that film noir fans should check out. Romantics will like it, too.

SIDE STREET -  Although not as interesting as the above film, this recently-released film noir features one of the best noir directors: Anthony Mann, who always makes sure we get some great visuals. Good angles, shadows and light and a great big-city feel of New York help make this a visual treat.

Along the way, we get a not-untypical noirish tale of an basically-good guy who makes a dumb move and pays for his sins even after his conscience gets the best of him and he tries to atone. This winds up to be a story of a man chasing the real crooks, while the crooks and the police chase him! They still make films with these kind of plots and they are almost always interesting.

Granger does a fine job in the lead as the dupe, ""Joe Norson,"" who is too weak to pass up easy money and pays for it.  O'Donnell is his wife and gets second billing but she really doesn't have that big a role. A bunch of other actors really share ""supporting cast"" status as Granger rules the roost here, lines-wise.

The city of New York might be the real second star of this film. There are many shots of it and its skyscrapers, from above and street level looking up. I love those old cars, too!",1241568000,2,2858,4.419047619047619
2824542,5,B000PKG7CU,"This is an excellent package, combining a true classic of the genre with a rarer piece with which it shares a lot of common connections.

THEY LIVE BY NIGHT is the first screen telling of the novel, THIEVES LIKE US, remade in the 70s with great skill by Robert Altman, This one has a more conventional style from the late forties, but both are totally effective depictions of a pair of young lovers on the lam.

Very moving, tragic. Well performed, all around. The Altman version is one of the best 70s films and this one is every bit as impressive. A lot has been made of its connections to BONNIE AND CLYDE, but unlike those outlaws, these two kids are total innocents, and the two actors are completely believable.

The commentary is good, although not extraordinary. The film historian brings up good points, but Granger doesn't really have many meaningful things to add. Still, it's worthwhile; I'm very glad they chose to have a commentary track.

SIDE STREET is an MGM ""B"" that had the same two actors, filmed in 1950, two years past NIGHT. It's very nice;
again the leads are totally innocent-types who end up in a maelstrom of trouble due to one false step. It was totally new to me, so I found it to be a perfect bookend to the earlier film. Commentary here was fine, too.",1215993600,7,1282,4.512931034482759
2824543,4,B000PKG7CU,"I'm not a great fan of Nicholas Ray but he made in ""They Live by Night"" a truly classic film. The film has its lacks, or rather annoyances, but they don't take away from the overall feeling of watching Granger and the girl (sorry I forgot her name just now) playing the best ""Romeo & Juliet"" ever seen on film. Romeo/Juliet on its poor and Southern version, not the rich and glamorous. They just look so natural and the camera is right where the viewer wants to be.

The story is not that awesome, a typical story of an amateur gang of bank robbers, the young man who falls in love -while on the run- with a beautiful, gentle, and lovable country girl. His fate is sealed from the beginning, we sense it, but we follow their adventures and dreams of family happiness nevertheless. But the law is merciless and makes no distinction between the hard-hearted gangster and the harmless kid who makes bad choices. Sometimes character exaggeration becomes a little aggravating, like with the heartless policemen or the nosey bystanders and shop assistants.

But the intensity of the love relationship between the young married couple is mesmerizing.

The second feature is just a nice extra. Directed by Anthony Mann, who's better with Westerns, has some nice shots of the streets of naked NYC, with persecutions and some tension. But the story lack quality and interest. Granger plays another innocent and recently married guy who steals some big money from an office while delivering mail; his fate is sealed again, and we follow him the other 3 quarters of the film in his misadventures. One keeps thinking how foolish he was, and how well he deserved all his troubles. The girl here plays a less conspicuous role.",1208822400,,1711,4.754208754208754

8192080,5,B000PKG7CU,"I have only seen the film ""Side Street"".

A gripping film noir. This film picks up after a slow first couple minutes and then moves at a good pace.

A young man (Farley Granger) steals some petty cash for the first time to pay for his innocent wife's maternity care in the hospital. Unbeknownst to him; there is a much larger sum within the folder than he thought and he is unaware he has stolen from murderous criminals. Murder and extortion are linked to the money. Things go from bad to worse. We see his dilemma and share in his decisions; ""That is good."" ""Don't do that!"" What will happen as a result?",1387238400,,606,4.353982300884955
8192081,5,B000PKG7CU,"This is the most fantastic double bill of film-noir I have seen, ""They Live By Night,"" Nicholas Ray's directorial debut(incredible influence) and Anthony Mann's heat-packing, ""Side Street."" They both are story-driven, character-etched well-photographed mid-century studies of man caught in the undertow of crime featuring shared co-leads, Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell, young lovers on the run attempting to create their own world away from responsibility in rural midwest. But in ""Side Street"" Farley Granger's character makes a wrong choice that begins a hunt for the real criminals before the law catches up with him in the confining big city. ""They Live By Night"" will remind you of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" superficially, where violent gunplay was nearly co-star, whereas here the off-setting driving force is the growing genuine love of Granger for O'Donnell that plays in opposition to the violent, hardened ex-cons like the one-eyed leader.(Howard Da Silva,(of ""David and Lisa"")It is this innocent love bond that grows while the law envelops the two that ultimately breaks your heart at the climax with one of the most touching fade-outs in cinema, more touching than the closing words in ""The Grapes of Wrath."" In Mann's ""Side Street"" from the start the urban skyscraper habitat of New York appears to oppress Granger's scrounging, post-war character. With a master cameraman's work, every character has an edginess to them. Granger makes a weak choice and it costs him his anonymity and innocence. The chase begins, the hoods are after him and so is the law with his innocent bride in the hospital,(he does explain tenderly his predicament, making a couple desperate hospital visits) until the climax. The camera work moves the action swiftly. It contains more surprises than most Saturday afternoon movies. Granger must rise above his resources to prove his innocence, yet confront the hardened hoodlums (a corrupt attorney for one)time and again to regain his self-respect. You are certain he does that by the time he is forced at gunpoint to drive a thug away from the reaches of law through lower Manhattan at sunrise. Granger ends the chase of pursuing cop cars suddenly swerving his car to a crash and encircling pistol fire. Paul Kelly's(detective) closing narration explains the finish as easily as he opens the slice of life down ""The Side Street.""",1382227200,2,2366,5.21259842519685
