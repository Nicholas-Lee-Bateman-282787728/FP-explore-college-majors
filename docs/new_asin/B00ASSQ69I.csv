5508128,5,B00ASSQ69I,"Recommend all the Buck Denver DVDs to all ages.  You may think you know the Bible -but there is always something to learn
from these DVDs.  I buy them for my Grandkids as I did this Volume ten (for Easter).  I sneak a preview and have even shared
the tapes with my Bible Study ladies (our group has met for 27 years!)...and there is always some discussion.  Thanks for bringing
the Good News in a new form.",1366416000,,406,4.233766233766234
5508129,5,B00ASSQ69I,"We have all the What's in the Bible videos up to this point. I have a fifteen year old and a twelve year old. They get many a laugh from Phil Vicher's presentation of the Bible, but they (and I) have also learned a lot. If you want an engaging, easy to understand video about the Bible and in particular about Jesus, this is for you. You'll laugh and maybe cry with this one. Never would have thought it possible with puppets, but should have guessed seeing it was Phil Vicher's work.",1365811200,,484,4.271739130434782
5508130,5,B00ASSQ69I,"We have watched all of this series with our daughter (now 7), usually buying the new releases as soon as they come out. She has learned so much about the Old Testament by watching those first 9 videos, and so have my husband and I. We work with children in the church and find that we often use explanations from these videos to help us explain concepts to our students. I have to be honest here and admit that there are many things covered in this series which I have either never heard or understood, having grown up with no biblical training at all. This is a great resource!

Throughout the ENTIRE Old Testament videos (9 in all), every video has pointed to the problem of sin and the promise from God to send a Redeemer, a Savior, a Messiah... what they refer to as God's ""rescue plan"" to save us from sin. I have really appreciated this, as too often Christians skip over all of that and jump right to the good news.... but why is it ""good"" if we don't understand the bad news? I am so thankful for the thoroughness of this important aspect. The Old Testament is much more than a history of Israel, it shows us why we need a Savior and points us to Him. Phil Vischer has handled this beautifully in all of the Old Testament videos.

 But I was concerned about how the Gospels would be handled in video 10... I was worried that it would be ""too silly"" or irreverent about Jesus. Would Chester Whiggits tell the crucifixion account using his popsicle stick puppets? Surely not! But what if...

And I was concerned that there would be a ""prayer for salvation"" included in the video, which could lead many children to false conversion before they had been led by the Holy Spirit to do so. I do not see any biblical basis for having someone copy a prayer in order to be saved, but this is a tactic used by many children's videos. Surely Phil would not do this, after being so thorough in his explanations of salvation and redemption and why we need a Savior... but still I wondered and worried how it would be handled.

But we got this video, and watched it, and now I wonder what in the world I was worried about! The very issue of my concern with which character would tell about the death of Christ was actually made into a fun part of the show, with the end decision being that Phil (the human host) would tell the account... and he does so with great respect and love. This video was still funny without being ""too silly"" about such a profound subject. There is a quiet time after the depiction of the death of Christ in which the puppet characters reflect with great seriousness while a choir sings ""Were you there when they crucified my Lord?""

Jesus is clearly portrayed as the ONLY way to salvation, but there was no ""follow along with me"" prayer... Phil just gently guides the children to talk about these things more with a parent, church leader or other adult. So that fear of children being led to parrot a prayer was unjustified. I feel badly now for not having trusted Phil in what God has led him to do with these videos.

I love that there is a video series for children which does not dumb down the message (quite the opposite, as in this video there is even a good explanation of ""the fullness of time"" and reference to Jesus being like the Passover lamb, good stuff), but at the same time it is completely watchable and understandable.

This video has been just as full and rich as the others, and exceeded my expectations on content, while meeting none of my concerns. We're anxious to see the next one.",1365206400,45,3525,4.387442572741194

5508138,5,B00ASSQ69I,"This is a great series.  It really has really expanded bible knowledge for my children (age 6 and 8) both in detail and big picture.  As a commandment keeping Christian who observes the literal 4th commandment as written, I wondered if I would find some of the interperations unbearably contrary to what I am teaching my children.  Those things that were contrary to our beliefs were minimal and only provided opportunity for discussion.  The maker of this series, Phil Fischer,  is himself a theistic evolutionist.  However, I have not seen anything in the series that is not compatible with the literal creation week (I have not watched every detail of the series, but I have viewed much of it).  As a parent, you should watch these  for the first time with your kids (who knows you may learn a thing or two yourself ((I did))).  In this way, you can discuss things that come up.

These are silly.  Don't get me wrong.  At times they are terribly silly.  But the silliness mixed with real solid biblical content makes for the prefect balance of pertinent bible knowledge wrapped in just enough entertainment to keep your kids wanting to watch.  My kids do not make a fuss when I pop these in and sometime ask for them.  Buck Denver is a huge hit.  If nothing else they are memorizing the books of the bible even if the silliness comes in full measure.  You will find yourself laughing at the lyrics.  Compared with Veggie Tales, this offers way more content and theology.  I recommend them.",1478044800,,1492,4.625954198473282

5508169,5,B00ASSQ69I,"For nine volumes, Phil Vischer and his puppet friends have lead us through all the books of the Old Testament, showing us how sinful we are and how holy God is.  With volume 10 of Whats in the Bible?, were finally entering the New Testament, and Jesus is the Good News! is a strong way to do so.

As always, there is lots of information crammed into these two half hour shows.  The first one is really background.  It covers the 450 year period between the two parts of the Bible and the theories on why God waited until the Roman Empire was established to send the Messiah.  We also get a glimpse of the authors of the Gospels and the major Jewish groups on the scene at the time.

With all that established, the second show delves into the contents of the Gospels.  It spends roughly half the time on the life and ministry of John the Baptist and then Jesus.  As has always been the case with these videos, very few of the familiar stories are retold.  The assumption is that everyone knows these stories from Sunday School.  Instead, the focus is on what the stories show and how they fit Gods redemption plan.

To that end, the episode talks about not only Jesus paying the penalty for our sin on the cross but also why we need to study both the Old and New Testaments what the kingdom of God looks like today.  Maybe because so much of my Bible training has focused on the New Testament, but this is the first volume where I felt Phil was skimming over the surface and not really covering the topics he brought up completely.  Of course, to really cover all the theology here, hed have to spend hours, and he only had one.  I certainly don't remember getting any of the information presented here at all in the target elementary school age range, so my hat is off to him for what he does teach.  There is some good theology here and kids will enjoy it.

So far, this is sounding kind of dry.  And the second half is certainly more serious than the first.  But rest assured that the cast of puppets do insert their jokes and interruptions throughout the entire thing.  Every is more serious when discussing Jesus, but the show is still entertaining.  And when you remember that Phil does all the puppets himself, the voice work is pretty amazing.

The real weakness here is the songs.  Once again, they're okay, but nothing better.  Phil wrote them himself, and there are very few of them.  I could see kids enjoying them, and since thats the target audience, they are all that truly matter.

So Jesus is the Good News! is a great introduction to the New Testament.  With only three more volumes to go, Im looking forward to see how Whats in the Bible? wraps things up.",1429660800,,2673,4.393075356415479
5508170,5,B00ASSQ69I,"My children cannot get enough of this series. My older son who is now 5 has been watching it for about 8 months now, and What's in the Bible is pretty much the only thing he wants to watch. He has gained so much understanding of who God is and what is in the Bible. Plus I find myself referencing it so often when addressing some of the ""tough"" questions that people have. We finally got to watch this volume just before Easter, so it was perfect timing. There was someone who said that there was not enough story, too much talking. The first time my son watched it, he said he did not like it, but after he watched it again he was hooked. I have found this is true for many children at this age. It has so much good information I think it is worth trying again if the first time it doesn't take. It is also really important to start with Genesis because they really develop the characters and you get a lot of background. I also should tell you that my almost 2 year old constantly asks for this movie. We really try not to let him watch TV, but once in a while I will let him since big brother is watching. Genesis holds his attention for 30 minutes, the others anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. Bible was one of his first words because of this movie.

5508208,5,B00ASSQ69I,"In Volume 9, the highlight was the rap-style song with the two British brothers and the Sunday School Lady. In other volumes, highlights have been songs by the fabulous Bentley Brothers, or songs sung by a group of puppets in canoes, or on a riverboat.

In this DVD, Volume 10, the highlight is the smile on the cartoon Jesus face.

Now in the New Testament, Phil Vischer, who created the VeggieTales characters and episodes before doing this series, starts with a summary. This is something this series does really wellit keeps putting things in perspective.

So Episode 1 begins with a good but brief summary of the Old Testament. It also explains how the Old and New Testaments relate to each other. Vischer later explains this using an analogy about 2 paintings on glass. It also explains why there was a time gap between the two Testaments.

Episode 2 is a simple, fairly complete, touching explanation of the story of Jesus. It seamlessly weaves together the four Gospels, and keeps a perspective on both what happened, and why it happened, and also what it means to us.

It explains the story of the crucifixion in a way suitable for small children.

One helpful outcome of this series is we adults often focus attentions on one book at a time. This overview helps us see how the entire Old Testament points toward the need for a Messiah. The DVDs after us help us see how actions flow out from Gospels.

This DVD covers this central part of the Bible, what the Gospels are, and the second part gives the core basics of the story of Jesus. His puppets help Vischer tell it, and animation is used. Even the music for the credits is poignant.

One reason for this series is not just to gain knowledge, but to increase faith, and develop a love for learning about God, and a love for the Messiah, Jesus. The puppets reaction to Jesus story is be thought-provoking, and a way to open discussion of some fairly deep theology, even with small children.",1418342400,2,1953,4.60806916426513
5508209,5,B00ASSQ69I,"The Bible is filled with God's promises and because of Jesus all of God's promises will come true. This is just one of the many things your child will learn as he watches, What's In The Bible: Jesus Is the Good News DVD #10. Jesus singlehandedly can save the world! We learn even more about the order of the gospels and why the book of Matthew was first in the order of the Gospels. Each volume of the What's In The Bible series is an awesome teaching tool for my children. In our homeschool Bible is one of our subjects we need to study and these DVD's are entertaining and thought provoking as wel as providing a deeper knowledge into all things Bible related.

 As a parent, I like giving my children an outlet that provides learning but also hold their attention. When they walk away from watching one of these DVD's they always learn something new.

5508210,5,B00ASSQ69I,"Ive mentioned at least once or twice that I like VeggieTales. And while the jury is still out on the new Veggies in the House Netflix series, one thing I can count on is the quality of products put out by the creator of Bob and Larry - and the voice of many vegetables among other characters. Case in point: Whats in the Bible, Phil Vischers latest project.

Imagine if you will, a variety show of sorts that strives to discuss the Bible - book-by-book - in a way that engages and entertains children. This series is even better than that. (You need a better imagination - just kidding, calm down). Puppets, animation, songs, speaking, and more characters than you can shake a stick at make this a show thats quite fun to watch. Beyond that, its chock full of informative and interesting content that will actually enrich the lives of the viewer, be it a child or adult (for example, me).

Volume ten kicks off the New Testament and I simply love the general thought presented here that the Old Testament is a story without an ending and the New Testament is a story without a beginning, but when they're taken together, its a wonderful and amazingly complete picture. Such a nice thought.

Now, my kids still show interest in this series even though they are probably out of the target audience, so Id say its most appropriate for 10 and under, will hold the attention of maybe 14 and under, but will benefit all - even the barely paying attention overhearers. So, if you haven't checked this series out and you have anyone near the target audience, do check it out. It looks like a lot of them are on sale right now, too.",1417651200,,1623,4.476351351351352
5508211,4,B00ASSQ69I,"Gone are the flannel graphs we all remember from our Sunday School days. From the creators of VeggieTales comes a new series of children's DVDs explaining the Bible, featuring puppets and animation that will catch the attention of any child. I was impressed with the way they explained difficult concepts in such an easy to understand and entertaining way. Really, this DVD was a lot like a Sunday School lesson that is a lot more fun than coloring pages while the teacher reads the lesson. The puppets are cute, the animation has such vivid colors, and the songs are just plain cute. Plus, children will get an introduction to several hymns that pertain. Buck Denver Asks... What's In The Bible? Is a really neat idea to explain Biblical truths to children. Volume 10 Jesus Is The Good News! is a fun way to learn about the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the most important story of them all.

(I received a free copy of this DVD from Flyby. I was not required to give a positive review. All opinions are entirely my own.)",1417564800,,1050,4.585106382978723
5508212,5,B00ASSQ69I,"I have been given an opportunity to watch and review a DVD of Buck Denver asks... What's in the Bible? Jesus is the Good News! (Vol. 10) My children have all been big fans of Veggie Tales, and while I've never watched this volume of videos, I determined that it surely would be every bit as good as Veggie Tales. I was right.

What I love about these videos is that it's relevant for children but also fun for adults. There are little comical bits that made me chuckle, and the video was educational yet fun for children.

Episode 1 covers the 400 years between the Old Testament and the New, and is entitled ""God's Perfect Timing"". Episode 2 teaches about Jesus and is entitled ""The Messiah Has Come!"" I felt that each video was appropriately timed to hold children's interest and seemed to present the story completely and with an entertaining quality.

The use of puppets, an adult actor (Phil Vischer himself) answering questions, and music was all very well intertwined. The mesh of them didn't seem corny, which is a problem that I sometimes find with children's Bible videos.

I plan on using this in my home and will recommend it to my church youth ministries!",1417564800,4,1168,4.600961538461538
5508213,5,B00ASSQ69I,"I loved this DVD. Phil Vischer has a way to reach kids on a level they will understand, yet still provide entertainment for the adults who are watching. Even more than the entertainment, though, is the wonderful lessons learned. Actually, there was even one thing taught from an angle I had never considered. At least I had never given it much thought. There were also a few things that I did not realize until I was an adult, so it is refreshing to see kids learning about the Bible, the significance of events, and the authors of the books. I highly recommend this DVD, and have no doubt that the others are also top-notch. It is recommended for 1st-4th grade...but I enjoyed it immensely.

5508214,5,B00ASSQ69I,"Ever since I watched and reviewed Buck Denver asks...Why do we call it Christmas, the family has become fans of this series. I didn't know what to expect going in, but now, I'm so glad I went after the opportunity to review these videos.

In Vol. 10, Jesus is the good news, it focuses on the books of the Bible, Matthew, Mark, Luke, & John. There is so much that happens in these books that is so important. I was interested to see how Jesus' life, death on the cross, and then him rising from the grave would be handed. It can be a tough topic for adults. I was very happy to see how they explained it and the demonstrations used for kids to understand. My littles seems to grasp the idea of what Jesus did better then she ever has since then. It has also led to more questions and discussions, which has been nice to have.

The stories presented were very educational and they touched on so many things, and the best part is, they didn't lose the importance behind them. Each segment is fun with the cartoons, puppets, and live action. They mesh well and work in telling these stories at a level that a kid can understand, without dumbing it down.

This is definitely a series I would recommended to anyone with kids.

5508235,5,B00ASSQ69I,"This is the first of the Buck Denver movies we have owned.  It is VERY well written.  My children were all entertained by the music and fun extras in the show.  The main part of the show was geared to a bit older children.  My children are 2, 4, 6, and 8.  The 6 and 8 year old stayed glued to the tv and watched the entire DVD.  The 2 and 4 year old came and went to see the silly parts.  The part I liked the best, is that afterwards my children could tell me what was in the video, and it had deepened their understanding of Jesus and the Bible.

This could easily be used for a family worship time to include up to adults.  There are a lot of topics that you could discuss in depth to teach Bible knowledge to children of all ages.

My two and five year old could barely sit still for this one. Maybe the other videos have more animation or puppetry, but this one seemed like I was watching a lecture series. I can see why this is popular: it talks about the Bible, it has puppets, it was made by the creator of Veggies Tales. All these things are great, but children are not going to learn the saving grace of Jesus by osmosis. It would be like reading the Bible in Greek and Aramaic. It would be without understanding. This video is so garbled with information, my worry is that children will ""check out"" before any real understanding happens. Maybe older children are able to follow along with the history, and theology presented in this. Maybe it would be more effective watched in shorter sessions and discussed in small groups. I don't know. I'm trying to be open minded and I will watch it again just to make sure, but so far I wouldn't show this to anyone under the age of 12. Too long. Too borrow. Too wordy.
