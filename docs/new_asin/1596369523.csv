7799684,5,1596369523,"The Redeemed: Seeing the Messiah in the book of Ruth. This story of mercy and grace is brought alive through this study. The DVD package is very complete with many resources. I like the way the Leaders Guide noteworthy information on leading a Bible study with group guidelines,  goals, and helpful tips for before the session and opening  each session. Each of the six sessions has a memory verse as well as the key verse from Ruth.  The viewers guide is very helpful and will keep the participants engaged with the speaker, Dr. Sam Nadler a Jewish Believer and author of many noted books. The leader will enjoy using the questions for group discussion plus highlighting the principles gleaned from the session. The lessons bring out in-depth knowledge of the characters in the book of Ruth. Study questions to do on your own include a section called People, Places, and Things. This section explains Jewish words or customs and includes either a map or informative chart for an instant resource. Moabites and Ephrathites are explained as well as the term Hesed. Scripture prophecies relating  to the Messiah and the Levirate Marriage and the Canaf are explained. The last session has a complete genealogy of Jesus Christ. I received this pdf free from Rose Publishing Review Program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.",1469491200,3,1374,4.884120171673819
