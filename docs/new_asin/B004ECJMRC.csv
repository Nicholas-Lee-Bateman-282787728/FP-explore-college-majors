8426738,4,B004ECJMRC,"Lest you relegate Fred MacMurray to nothing but the role of the amicable gent in My Three Sons and Disney's The Absent-Minded Professor and The Shaggy Dog, take a peek at the classic film noir Double Indemnity or The Apartment or this one, Face of a Fugitive, and maybe that sparks a bout of reassessment. There are more colors to Fred MacMurray than a general state of affability. In Face of a Fugitive, he demonstrates his hard edge and, also, his ease at manifesting the shifts and flourishes and complexity of his role. He plays bank robber Jim Larsen, a loner who's never asked help from anyone, not even from his family. The story opens with Larsen in handcuffs, enroute to incarceration. Larsen escapes but not before the sheriff's deputy is bumped off (but not by Larsen). Cue the vigorous manhunt.

Face of a Fugitive chronicles two busy days in this outlaw's life, and, maybe, it'll be a busy AND transformative two days. On the lam, Larsen, wearing his father's old suit, connives a passage to a mining town what's awesomely named Tangle Blue. There, he passes himself off as ""Ray Kincaid,"" restless company man to the local mining operation. I appreciate the foresight and the lengths Larsen goes to, to establish his new identity. It surely helped in his landing a deputy gig with Tangle Blue's sheriff, what with folks he'd earlier met calling him ""Kincaid"" in familiar fashion in the sheriff's presence. I can't help but snicker that Kincaid is now a member of the posse what's hunting down that murderous fugitive, Jim Larsen.

Larsen is in a time crunch. Right now, no one knows what that fugitive looks like. That changes tomorrow early on, when the wanted posters come in with his mug plastered on it. So here's Larsen chafing in Tangle Blue, but maybe not chafing so much since making the acquaintance of the sheriff's widowed sister Ellen Bailey (Dorothy Green) and her six-and-three-quarters-year-old daughter Alice (Gina Gillespie).

Larsen is one of them hardline cynics. All he had to do was lay low and find opportunity to scamper out of Tangle Blue and into freedom. So why does he involve himself in the impending clash - over a fence! - between the do-right sheriff (Lin McCarthy) and the rancher (Alan Baxter)? The bone of contention has something to do with a portion of the rancher's land being deemed to be public property by the government, and how the sheriff insists that the rancher take that fence down to allow for public grazing and how the rancher maintains that it's his land as how he's held it for twenty years before the government stepped in. ""No man is important enough to walk wherever he wants,"" contends the sheriff. Frankly, I side with the rancher. If only he and his henchmen hadn't resorted to thuggery.

Maybe Larsen saw something admirable in the sheriff who never wanted to be sheriff but was talked into it. Maybe it's because of who his sister is. Maybe he badly needed the $5 a day in deputy's wages. Anyways, Larsen steps in, and his busy two days keep keeping on.

Since you ask, yes, Face of a Fugitive originally had the working title of Justice Ends with a Gun and is based on the short story ""Long Gone"" by Peter Dawson, the pen name of Jonathan H. Glidden, him what's the older brother of famous western writer Luke Short.

It's catalogued as a minor western, except there are several highlight moments here that would make proud any big-budget shoot-'em-up. I love when Fred MacMurray gets like this, when he's a hardcase. I particularly loved that one split second in which the camera cuts to MacMurray's face as his character contemplates simply opening fire on the two friendly deputies guarding the pass and denying him egress. And what about that badass scene in which he deliberately shoots the barb wire fence so that it coils around baddie James Coburn (in only his second feature film appearance)? If you dismiss MacMurray as this cordial, harmless guy, check out those scenes, and also when he grabs the bull by the horns and makes a move on the widow and, in the climax, when he takes on the rancher and his bully boys in that exciting ghost town showdown. Brusque and calculating and coldly practical, Larsen is the sort who shoots first if he reckons shooting is inevitable. He should've been able to easily light a shuck out of town. Instead, there we see him in the end, stricken by a widow's regard, moved to action by a lawman's integrity, betrayed by ambiguous morality what's undergone a sudden shift.

***By the way, I saw this movie on the TCM channel. I can't confirm or deny the poor quality of the DVD as mentioned by other folks.***",1456099200,,4625,4.709517923362175

Face of a Fugitive (1959) is a nice little Western with the more than reliable Fred MacMurray. I like him in Film-Noirs (Double Indemnity (1944), Pushover (1954) and Westerns (Quantez (1957), Good Day for a Hanging (1959).

Here he plays an outlaw, who isn't as bad as he seems. He makes an escape from a train with the unwanted aid of his brother, who gets shot and later dies. Also, the lawman was killed. So Fred MacMurray is on the run.

Jim Larsen, alias Ray Kincaid (Fred MacMurray) hops on a train to the next town, where he befriends the sheriff and his sister. He's drawn into their world and even stands up for the sheriff (Lin McCarthy), who's engaged with a dispute with a cattle man, Reed Williams (Alan Baxter). Look for a young James Coburn as one of his henchmen. He's in a ridiculous scene where Jim Larsen, alias Ray Kincaid (Fred MacMurray) shoots a barbwire fence and it wraps around him tightly.

Most of the action takes place in the small town, but still, it's a solid script and tight role for the likeable Fred MacMurray.",1452816000,2,1063,4.549738219895288

8426744,4,B004ECJMRC,"Fred MacMurray plays a bank robber in this 1959 film. He is captured and is being led off to jail when he overpowers the deputy that is taking him. His brother appears just after he frees himself, to rescue him. While the two are escaping, the deputy shoots and wounds the brother, who later dies of his wound, and the brother kills the deputy. MacMurray arrives at a town and identifies himself with a fictitious name.

The town sheriff is a young man who has no experience with guns; he never shot a man. He is threatened by a landowner who insists that a particular parcel his land belongs to him, while the sheriff contends that it is open land that can be used by anyone. The landowner says that he will shoot the sheriff tomorrow. One of the thugs working for the landowner is James Coburn, who plays a gunman. The sheriff has a sister who becomes emotionally interested in MacMurray, and he with her.

Two things will occur tomorrow. The landowner and his hired help will ride into town to shoot the sheriff, who will certainly be killed. A picture of the wanted bank robber, now sought for the murder of the deputy - MacMurray - will come to town. MacMurray should run while he has a chance, but decides to stay to help the sheriff. Will he be able to overcome the landowner and his gunfighters, one against many? Will the sheriff see that the picture is MacMurray and arrest him? What will happen to him? Is he able to have a relationship with the sheriff's sister?",1300320000,4,1474,4.455555555555556
