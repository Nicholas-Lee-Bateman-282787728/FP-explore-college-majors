5613455,5,B00BF4XJU8,"I loved the first half of Tiger & Bunny so I was really anticipating the second half. Once I got my copy I popped the fist disc in right away I was super excited! The second half takes place 10 months since the Heroes victory over Jake Martinez. Since then Tiger & Bunny have become the city's most popular hero team. They have rised in the hero rankings and everybody loves them. Now that Barnaby has complete trust in Kotetsu they have become a force to be reckoned with. Kotetsu's Hundred Power begins to increase but with that his power begins to fade. He can't hold his power for 5 minutes anymore and this begins to worry him. Barnaby learns that Jake wasn't the murderer of his parents. This revelation starts to get the better of him and causes his memories to shuffle images of who might the killer be, it also strains his relationship with Kotetsu. Once Barnaby gets closer to the truth, Mr. Maverick is revealed to be NEXT. He is able to manipulate people's memories and to protect himself he uses his powers to stop Barnaby from revealing him. He also wipes out the city's memory of Kotetsu as Wild Tiger. Everyone believes Kotetsu to be a killer and even the heroes don't remember him. To make matters worse an android is now the new Wild Tiger defusing any chance of hope Kotetsu had to prove his identity.

I really don't wanna spoil the ending or other details but I found the ending to be very satisfying and it lived up to the first half of the show. The quality was geat from start to finish. It also leaves room for a sequel and with the upcoming Tiger & Bunny The Rising movie maybe it'll give us one. I love this series so much it has become one of my favorite animes, one of the best that I've seen in a while. The storytelling is great it never got boring and always kept me in suspense. The animation is really nice combining 2D animation with CGI animation. The look of the show has that american influence which really looks nice. The voice acting is excellent as a fan of dubs this one is great. I love Wally Wingert's portrayal of Kotetsu he really nails his spirit and personality. The DVD set is a keepcase that holds 2 discs nothing fancy but does it's job. Not too many extra features I heard the Blu-rays have a few exclusives that the DVD lacks. Well I hope this is helpful to you guys. All I have left to say is please checkout Tiger & Bunny, even if your not a fan of anime I think you'll still enjoy it.",1369872000,,2441,4.318082788671024

If you love mechs, anime, and superheroes then you should totally look into this!! 5 stars!",1392854400,,246,4.25531914893617
5613464,4,B00BF4XJU8,Excellent series perfectly spoofing the superhero franchise. A Reality show with Corporate sponsored heroes? *Wink* it's as if the Avengers were corporate owned. Can you imagine the Hulk drinking Mountain Dew and smiling for the cameras? This series also goes beyond simple parody and manages to insert some drama/intrigue into the story line. It's worth buying.,1386806400,,362,5.482142857142857
5613465,5,B00BF4XJU8,"As good as Season 1 of T&B was, this season really raises the stakes and ups the game for this series as a whole. No spoilers here, but not all the secrets of Sternbild City have been revealed. We had been led to believe that Barnaby had brought his parents' killer to justice, but that turns out not to be the case. Dark secrets are revealed behind the origins of Hero TV and the history of Mr. Legend (Wild Tiger's guiding inspiration, who turns out to have a key connection to Lunatik's origin too). A covert NEXT is revealed to be the puppetmaster who has manipulated events in Sternbild City thus far. To top it off, it's now apparent that Wild Tiger's Hundred Power is fading and soon it will disappear, leading him to wrestle with the dilemma of whether he should try to continue as a hero or retire and devote his time to spending it with his daughter Kaede (who turns out to be a pivotal character in this season's story arc). In the midst of all this, Kotetsu is framed for a murder relating to the mystery of Barnaby's parents, and becomes a fugitive without the resources of the Hero network - and he is hunted down by his former associates, because none of the other heroes can even remember him! A new threat to the city rears its head in the form of a false Wild Tiger, who also has links to the history of Barnaby's parents. Deftly woven plot threads keep this season moving ahead so that you'll want to watch one episode after another without a break. Neat little character moments are sprinkled like nuggets throughout. One of the most satisfying anime series overall in a long, long time.",1386547200,,1607,4.450847457627119
5613466,4,B00BF4XJU8,I really enjoy the animation and the characters especially Kotetsu (Tiger).  It's also on the goofy side in my opinion but that's part of it's charm.  If nothing else they'll may make you laugh.,1380412800,,194,4.676470588235294
5613467,5,B00BF4XJU8,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
5613476,5,B00BF4XJU8,I was loving this story and was very surprised to see it come to a close. I did not expect that I was looking forward to seeing more. It was a great story and I heard they made two movies the first one a redo of the tv show and the second original content. I can't wait to see that second movie.,1378339200,,295,3.774193548387097
5613477,5,B00BF4XJU8,"I'm a huge fan of Tiger and Bunny, and I already had the part 1 DVD, but none of the stores near me carried part 2 even though it had already been out for a while, so I ordered online. I'm glad I ordered from here because it's reliable (I chose the 5 to 8 day delivery and it came in about 3) and it arrived in great condition.
As for the series, I highly recommend it! I think of it as Japan's take on Western superhero tropes; it maintains a fairly idealistic tone but that doesn't take away from the drama or tension in the show. The cast is very likeable and even if it plays all the typical superhero tropes straight, it doesn't feel like it's unoriginal or boring. If you're looking for a new show to try out, go out and get Tiger & Bunny!",1376265600,,745,4.04054054054054
5613478,5,B00BF4XJU8,I absolutely love this series.  Great story line and get a few laughs out of it. now just getting in the last words needed.,1374624000,,123,4.125
5613479,5,B00BF4XJU8,"A fantastic ending to a fantastic series!
From the characters to the plot-this is hands down one of the best anime productions I have ever watched.
The blue-ray edition makes for a fabulous experience with its crisp picture and vibrant colors.

5613480,5,B00BF4XJU8,"In the first half of ""Tiger & Bunny"", Kotetsu and Barnaby were able to overcome the power Jake Martinez, the person that is responsible for the murder of Barnaby's parents.

And now that both partners have been in sync, they have climbed on top of the ratings.  But suddenly, Kotetsu notices that his power has increased, but the minutes of having power has shortened.

He finds out from a good friend and a former boss, that Captain Legend, the hero that Kotetsu has idolized, also had that same problem and lost his power completely.  And this may be a sign that Kotetsu's power may disappear within weeks.

With his powers in decline, Kotetsu heads home and realizes how his daughter has had a tough life being left alone with her grandmother since her mother died.  And not knowing that her father is a hero, she thinks her father just doesn't want to be around her.

So, Kotetsu is contemplating spending more time and a family and retiring as a hero.  But just as he is about to tell Barnaby his plans, Barnaby finds out from one of Jake Martinez' followers that Jake was not responsible for the murder of Barnaby's parents.

This leads to Barnaby starting to have another mental breakdown and as for Kotetsu and his declining powers, can he quit now that his partner really needs him?

Find out in the second half of the popular anime series ""Tiger & Bunny""!

VIDEO:

""Tiger & Bunny"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio). ""Tiger & Bunny"" is probably one of the best, recent anime TV series that I have seen in awhile. From the detail of the futuristic structures, the costume design for the characters in superhero form, the mechanical design of vehicles and costumes and just the many location shots utilized for this anime series alone, these days, you don't see too many anime studios going all out for a TV series, but in this case, Sunrise went all out with ""Tiger & Bunny"".

Awesome character designs, background art is fantastic but just the character and mechanical designs featuring animation and CG is well-done. The character designs catches your attention with the colors and shading but the mechanical design and the superhero character designs look awesome. Even the art backgrounds as the futuristic city is well-painted, full of detail and adds to the overall look of the series.

""Tiger & Bunny"" looks magnificent in HD!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Tiger & Bunny"" is presented in lossless English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Both are similar when it comes to special effects. Dialogue is crisp and clear but voice acting is well-done on both the Japanese and English soundtrack. While it would have been nice to have a 5.1 lossless track, especially since this series has plenty of action, the series does sound crisp and clear through the front channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Tiger & Bunny: Blu-ray Set 2 comes with the following special features:

  Tamura & Katsura Exclusive Interview - (13:44) Interview with Kazuhiko Tamura (Sunrise) and original character designer, Masakazu Katsura and how he came up with the design for each hero.
  Production Art - Using your remote (or keyboard), you can look at the production art of ""Tiger & Bunny"".
  Illustration Gallery - Using your remote (or keyboard), you can look at the illustration gallery of ""Tiger & Bunny"".
  Japanese Trailers - (3:57) The Japanese trailers for ""Tiger & Bunny"".
  Clean Opening and Clean Ending

JUDGMENT CALL:

Fantastic!  It's the one word that I can describe the ""Tiger & Bunny"" series!

Earlier this year, a friend who attended Tokyo Anime Fair and Anime Contents Expo 2013, gave me a chance to see all the Tiger & Bunny cosplayers and some going so far to make the actual suits for Tiger and Bunny.  Even today, it's hard for me to imagine that Masakazu Katsura, a mangaka and designer who I followed since ""Video Girl Ai"" and ""DNA 2, was behind the character designs of these heroes.

An anime series that manages to capture humor, action, drama with wonderful character designs, mechanical designs and art backgrounds, one can say that ""Tiger & Bunny"" is an animated series that is a total package.

From the first half of the anime series which goes into introducing us to each characters, the second half focuses on Kotetsu and Barnaby as partners but the trouble both face when Kotetsu begins to lose his powers (permanently) and Barnaby finds out that the person they battled and defeated, was not the person who killed his parents.

Suffice to say, both men are at their highest point as heroes but their lowest point as individuals.  For Kotetsu, quitting his job as a hero and focusing on spending more time with his daughter is important, but also his honor as a hero to protect and also be their for his partner is equally important.

As a person who enjoys anime, we have seen the team dynamic in many forms.

From the sentai teams of yesteryear, may it be ""Gatchaman"", ""Voltron"" to super teams such as the Z-Warriors of ""Dragon Ball Z"", the ninjas of ""Naruto"" or the high school friends as seen on ""Bleach"" and ""Yu Yu Hakusho"".

But one thing that we often see in America through comic books, animated series and live action films are the superhero teams. May it be Marvel's X-Men, The Avengers or Fantastic Four or DC's Justice League of America, The Teen Titans or Legion of Super-Heroes and it has always been in the back of my mind, what if there was a caped superhero for an anime series?

We have seen a singular costumed heroes from anime series such as ""Moldiver"" and shows like the Kamen Rider or even Ranger series but what Sunrise was able to create with ""Tiger & Bunny"" is exciting, unique and different from anything ever featured in Japan.

Humans with special abilities known as NEXT who take on the bad guys, but in a twist, are featured on television and challenge other heroes of who can catch the most criminals and get the most points to increase their ranking, as each compete for the title ""King of Heroes"".

The characters are nothing like American superheroes in the fact that these are individuals that are flawed.  The main protagonist Kotetsu is an older superhero who knows he is not a great father. He speaks to her on intercom but is never there to see her face-to-face and his daughter pretty much gave up on seeing him. He knows he causes trouble for the station because he causes quite a bit of damage and now, to help put him on the right path, he is given a partner with Barnaby.

And while Barnaby has a cool demeanor, a strategist who thinks first before attacking, he also has a tragic past that drives him to become a superhero and that is to find the killer responsible for killing his parents.

The two are joined by heroes that are interesting. Blue Rose is popular because of her sexy outfit and cute demeanor when fighting criminals but deep inside, she is torn between pursuing her dream to become a singer or being a hero. Dragon Kid is a tomboy and doesn't like to wear cute things, but as she gets older, she is starting to discover her feminine side. Meanwhile, Fire Emblem is an effeminate hero who wants to be accepted by the girls, but yet is considered as a guy. Rock Bison is more interested in partying with Kotetsu and getting drunk than capturing criminals and now he is in danger of losing his job because he is in last place. And Origami Cyclone, a shy guy who has the power to shapeshift but feels it's a worthless power and is more of a cheerleader than a person who does the fighting to capture the criminals.

Suffice to say, each of these characters are unlikely heroes but yet as a team, they are starting to work well with each other. But it takes time, and also, as much as they are a team when facing difficult criminals, they are also rivals trying to get the most points and representing their sponsors with pride.

""Tiger & Bunny"" really is an anime series that is unlike anything I have seen before in my decades of watching anime.  And with this second half, the story becomes much more captivating, much better than the first half and I am definitely impressed with this series overall!

And as for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is vibrant and colorful. Sunrise is known for creating magnificent looking anime series but ""Tiger & Bunny"" features wonderful character and mechanical designs and a great balance between animation and CG. I was really impressed with how cool this series looks. And you get both Japanese and English soundtracks in lossless 2.0 and a few special features are included.

Overall, ""Tiger & Bunny"" was an awesome anime series when it first began and for its second half, it managed to become better and better with each episode!  I absolutely love this series and for anyone wanting a divergence from the banal anime series that they come across, and want something with a superhero angle but with humor, action and drama.

""Tiger & Bunny: Blu-ray Set 2 is highly recommended!",1372896000,2,8928,4.68545803971813
5613481,5,B00BF4XJU8,expensive but hot off the market. cds are brand new. The wrapping is on the box. No complaints at all.,1372464000,,102,4.15
5613482,5,B00BF4XJU8,"The story picks up 10 months after the events of the first half. Things are a little different now - Tiger and Barnaby are actually working well together, people love Heroes more than ever, and at last Tiger has both popularity and respect. Life is good, but it is too good to last. Kriem has been in a coma, but now she has woken up. And she has some unwelcome news for Barnaby that will destroy the tranquility he has been enjoying since he achieved his revenge....

The second half of Tiger & Bunny is where I really came to love this show. The first half is fun, but the second half is great. The storyline is much more exciting and smoother (no side stories to break it up).  Anyone who was annoyed by Tiger in the first season will appreciate his character growth in the second half.

The story wraps up nicely, though leaving a little wiggle room for a sequel (which I hope for, but haven't heard anything about). There are two Tiger & Bunny movies. The first one is a retelling of the series (probably the first half), and the second one comes out Fall 2013. The first movie will be available streaming on Neon Ally and will probably get a DVD release eventually.",1372377600,2,1171,4.387096774193548
5613483,5,B00BF4XJU8,The first half of tiger and bunny was fun and entertaining while getting serious towards the end. With part 2 you learn more about all the characters even the old legends. Goes out with a bang. Only complaint is how it ends very openly. Overall tiger and bunny is one of the better animes I have watched this year.,1372204800,,314,4.338983050847458
5613484,4,B00BF4XJU8,"Great animation and thrilling action as the mystery behind Bunny's parents finally gets wrapped up.  The conspiracy around Tiger also was thrilling, even if his attempts to escape it were lame but funny.",1371168000,,203,5.151515151515151
5613485,5,B00BF4XJU8,"""may contain spoilers""
the mysterious Lunatic rears his head again, we learn more of his past and what made him the way he is. tiger has developments with his life and powers, Barnaby has run into new leads with regards to his parents, their work and deaths. blue rose begins to have confliction within her heart.

in this set of the hit anime ""tiger & bunny"" we will see new nexts, and many plot twists that we thought solved in the set 1. In my opinion its just has good as the set 1, and i hope for set 3 soon. the overall happenings of this set are a series of plot twists revolving around our heros, that seem to slap the view in the face, who thought they had figured out and solved the plot. all i can say is pay attention to detail, many of the people save in set 1 appear in the background and don't show up in the plot(just thought you should know), be watchful and aware and don't disappear, stay tuned for the next in the series set 3

info on set
