6401904,5,B00K31RC0W,"Great in the early seasons-as ridiculously 80's as you can get-the silly plots, average acting-totally awesome!  And 2 seasons in one disc set-what a treat!! So much fun to watch again I might buy Season 3. :-)",1420329600,,210,4.675675675675675
6401905,5,B00K31RC0W,"For those who bought the original Sony release of season 1, you probably might recall the two hour-long episodes were included in edited, syndication versions (the episodes were split in two parts, and were around 22 minutes each). This new re-release by Mill Creek, however, includes those episodes in their original, uncut form (1 part, roughly around 48:30).

So, even if you have those original releases, you might want to get either this set, or Mill Creek's re-release of season 1 only. This way, you'll have the best of both worlds (better quality on the Sony sets, uncut versions of ""The Retrospective"" and ""The Trip"" on the Mill Creek set). If you don't have the Sony sets, this is a safe bet to buy. Quality still holds up well enough, despite 11 episodes per disc.",1418256000,5,775,4.7407407407407405

6401908,5,B00K31RC0W,"OMG, who didn't love diff'rent strokes???  my kids are getting a HUGE kick out of this season and we are enjoying watching it with the kids, brings back the good old days..love it!!!",1414454400,4,182,4.515151515151516
6401909,4,B00K31RC0W,I have loved this show all my life and  wanted this on DVD for a lint time but the price was too expensive. I was this 2 season set for around $10 so I ordered but Mill Creek needs to make their cases a little better so the discs aren't at risk in being damaged. I guess this is so you will have to buy another copy in the future,1412467200,,329,3.7
6401910,4,B00K31RC0W,"This is a cute DVD set.  I grew up watching this show.  One thing I forgot about was how much they bring up the issue of race in the episodes.  Just beware that for younger kids, it comes up a lot, and you may have some explaining to do.  I am raising my kids to respect everyone, look at the character, not the clothing or outward appearance.  In the episodes, the Jackson boys are often called ""black"" and the issue of them living with a white man and his daughter is mentioned time and again.
For it's time, this show was trying to break barriers.  It makes me uncomfortable how many episodes cover this ""problem"" over and over when this ""newly made family"" is happy together and we can all see that they are of different races.  Why must we go over it into the ground?  Still, it's a cute show and fun to re-live your childhood when watching.",1411948800,,846,4.276729559748428

6401912,1,B00K31RC0W,This is by far one of best shows to grace the television in its time. I see more shows coming out immediately to DVD and are not as good as DIFFERENT STROKES when will these shows be released for the diehards??????,1409097600,2,214,4.2439024390243905
6401913,2,B00K31RC0W,"I love the show, but why did Mill Creek bring the first two seasons out again at a cheaper price... It must be lame set at a cheap price... We need to bring out season 5... What's up with Sony?",1407888000,2,193,3.85

6401924,5,B00K31RC0W,"I love this show...simple as that. Gary Coleman is/was so adorable! I watched each of the episodes and did not feel they were too ""cheesy"" as some of the 70's/80's sitcoms were. There were real issues presented and they were handled realistically. I  enjoyed how the ""Mr. Drummond"" character interacted with his children...rarely raises his voice and helped his children work through their problems rather than putting them down for making wrong choices. Great family show.",1460160000,2,473,5.223684210526316

6401929,5,B00K31RC0W,My 10-year old start watching re-runs during Xmas break and was hooked. Good common sense lessons. Don't have to worry about the crazy language in current so-called children sitcoms. Touches on issues of race relations in a way that kids can understand.,1452211200,3,253,5.0476190476190474

6401931,4,B00K31RC0W,"How does this Mill Creek combo pack compare to Sony's earlier releases of this classic sitcom's first two seasons? First the good:

- A bargain price, perfect for those on a budget
- Unlike the previous releases, which used the edited-for-syndication, 2-part versions of ""Retrospective"" and ""The Trip"", both episodes are presented here in their original hour-long formats

Now the bad:

- The special features from the Sony releases are not included
- For some reason, Mill Creek chose to use a single-capacity spindle to hold all 4 discs, increasing the possibility of scratches or other accidental damage...couldn't they spring for more suitable packaging?

However, if you can get past these shortcomings, the set's still a great value for your money, so decide for yourself.",1451174400,2,778,5.2

I love that the dad in the series is portrayed as wise and caring and not foolish and dumb!
