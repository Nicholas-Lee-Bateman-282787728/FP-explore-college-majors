I especially loved the colorful characters such as the beekeeper who tickles his bees with his mustache and the women dances with thousands of bees on her body. The film had some humor too but it really dives deeply into the issues and helped me understand the problems and then solutions. I learned so much about this world of beekeeping and was relieved that it was uplifting and not doom and gloom. I recommend this film to everyone.",1328400000,13,484,4.6395348837209305

4910976,5,B005ZMBDJK,"Queen of the Sun is much more about the importance of our relationship to bees, and how integral they are to our food system.  Sure there is a bit of crazy in there, but its completely beautiful and fun.  There is also deep concern for the state of modern beekeeping and its part factory farming, pesticide use, and complete lack of sustainability; which is a real problem for those of us who enjoy eating.  In response to the negative review that stated european honey bees are not native to the Americas - neither are we.",1326672000,24,523,4.484210526315789
4910977,3,B005ZMBDJK,"A respectable quantity of good information appealingly presented but contaminated by interviewees who leap beyond evidence in making their proclamations and anthropomorphize bees and nature to a bizarre degree.

4910980,5,B005ZMBDJK,"Queen of the Sun tells an important story of the importance of bees to life as we know it on this fragile planet. As master pollinators, they are the enablers of agriculture, and account for the majority of the food that we consume. It was very enlightening to see that the majority of bees (80+% as I recall) required to pollinate the California almond crop are imported from across the U.S. This huge monoculture crop simply can't sustain the quantity of bees required to pollinate the trees each spring. Michael Pollan speaks only a few times in this documentary, but he makes a very strong statement about the disastrous consequences of monocultures in agriculture today. Frequent use of the phrase ""colony collapse"" helps to reiterate the seriousness of the worldwide bee crisis.

The filming in this documentary is quite stunning, and certainly drives home the important message. However, I think that the inclusion of just a few too many weird beekeepers actually detracts from the message. The Frenchman who parades around shirtless and tickles the bees with his mustache doesn't really help to communicate the importance of bees; he just makes it seem odd to be a beekeeper. The film does end with a segment about beekeeping in New York, which is apparently now legal, though it was still not permitted at the time of the filming. This segment helps to enforce the message that we can all play a small part in helping to ensure the survival of this most essential species.",1476403200,,1481,4.853754940711463

4910996,5,B005ZMBDJK,"I enjoyed this film more than any I have watched in a long time. I stand in awe after watching it, and the AMAZING nature of honeybees. If we as citizens of this world, could adapt our attitudes and our natures to be as selfless and serving as the bees-to realize it is all about community-looking after each other and giving our lives in service to promote the betterment of community, it would be nirvana. I don't know how much happier state we could achieve, than that. We have an enormous responsibility to create a world that the bees can ""do their thing"" in, free of pesticides and harmful circumstances to the hives. I was filled with joy, hearing the love and joy spoken by the beekeepers regarding their love for what they do. I picked up on the peace they all seemed to radiate, talking about the bees. This documentary was so worthwhile, and so informative, I enjoyed every minute of watching it. I loved hearing from beekeepers all over the world, seeing the beauty of their country, and the eternal hope of the last beekeeper from Floyd, VA say, "" People ask how I can have hope with the state of the world today? Why do I hold on to hope? Well,  I hope to say I will hold on to hope until the very end.""

4911011,4,B005ZMBDJK,"The photography is fantastic, but the premise of the conclusion falls short. The film mentions CCD and its catastrophic effect on the bees, but gives it only a cursory swish of information. I, and others, believe that CCD is the single most catastrophic event to affect beekeeping, with the potential to eradicate honeybees and all pollinators from certain areas of the planet, with dire consequences to human beings, livestock and wildlife in those areas. There are many ""possible"" answers for CCD, but most of them are not scientifically plausible, as most if not all of those conditions presented existed prior to 2005/2006 and the onset of WORLD WIDE CCD. Many of the ""possible"" causes are not pandemic to an area as it would be if it were disease, sunspots, global warming, cell phones, excessive use of aerosols, excessive misspelled words in newspaper articles, mites, viruses, general malaise of bees, early onset of male pattern baldness in men that live in New Jersey, etc, but occur only under specific conditions. When those conditions are removed, CCD ceases to be a factor in that area. There is a correlative event that occurred at that time, and was a WORLD WIDE event, that is highly suggestive of the cause of CCD. I present this for your consideration...While there is no ""smoking gun"" (no body, no discernible cause of death), the circumstantial evidence is enough to send a human to the gallows in a capital felony case. In full disclosure, I must mention that my point of conclusion is not accepted by all beekeepers, and probably not by a majority of scientists, but even if there was full consensus, that does not mean the information is correct or my theory incorrect. I refer you to Galileo and his rejection of geocentrism, which was the ""consensus"" of his time, or to Aristotle, teacher of Alexander the Great, that all matter is composed of five elements, a theory that held for 1000 years because no one dared question the authority of Aristotle. While I dare not compare myself to either of this men of great stature, it does show that consensus and authority can be incorrect. In this specific case of the possible causes of CCD, I refer the world wide release of neonicotinoid systemic pesticides, a synthetic nicotine derivative, in 2005/2006, followed within a year by world wide cases of CCD. In areas that did not use these systemic pesticides, there was no CCD. In areas that have since banned these systemic pesticides, the cases of CCD have been nearly nil. I am not a scientist, just a hobbyist beekeeper of many years. And, to be fair, most of the evidence is not empirical, but circumstantial, as there is no ""body"" to examine for the cause of death. I do not work for any chemical company nor do I have any knowledge of any relatives that work for any chemical companies. I have no vested interest, except for my love of bees and beekeeping. Beekeeping is a very LOGICAL pursuit, and therefore logic should be the first approach to finding the cause of CCD. Post hoc ergo proctor hoc, while not applicable in ALL cases of logic, should still be considered. In the case of CCD, we have the occurrence of the condition, due to an unknown outside influence, then, when that outside influence is removed, the condition ceases to exist. This would seem to be the text book case of the scientific method. Conduct the experiment under controlled conditions, change the experiment one variable at a time to determine the causative variable. Rinse and repeat. If a bird quacks like a duck, and walks like a duck, and looks like a duck, the chances are extremely high that it is a DUCK. If you remove the vested interests of the research organizations (and their funding sources), and the vested interest of the chemical manufacturers, it would seem that the answer is obvious if one looks at it in a LOGICAL manner. Maybe I am wrong, I have no scientific proof, and nothing but logic to offer in my presentation. I am not a scientist nor researcher, nor do I portray one on T.V. Signed... A probable quack and a hobbyist beekeeper.",1438819200,5,4066,4.752475247524752

One reviewer said it was ""preaching to the choir"" and I would second that, except that if ""choir"" is meant to denote beekeepers in general the world over, then no, I doubt that that ""choir"" is singing ""Amen.""  But if ""choir"" means anyone who shares the view that there's something mystical-magical about bees, then yes, this presentation of the plight of the honeybee definitely preaches to them folks.  But for the rest of us who just want to keep bees, or enjoy the fruits of their labors, or who want to learn anything we can about what's happening to them, this doesn't help at all.  Don't waste your time.  Join a local beekeepers club, take some classes, set up a couple colonies on your property, find an experienced mentor, and your education in the honeybee will take on - not mystical proportions as portrayed here - but real meaning.",1431043200,,898,4.622641509433962

4911054,3,B005ZMBDJK,"This movie is very much about creating a sense of awe of honey and bees, and it is pretty. The awe of bees is deserved. But the movie takes a lot of time with very little real contents - I just didn't need to watch quite that many views of bees on honeycombs, and while the image of a guy rubbing his moustache on the bee frames will stick with me, it's well outside any normal range of beekeeping practice. It spent a lot of time in a sort of mysticism and anthopomorphization of bees.

I've kept bees organically for about 8 years...they are amazing (I don't treat them with chemicals, but we do wear suits and don't try to pet them - we respect the bees). But while the movie mentions native bees in between emphasizing the urgency of the honeybee, it doesn't seem to consider them in its message.  The movie doesn't say if native bees are in decline or doing fine. I keep hearing (elsewhere) that mason bees are much better pollinators (at least in the PNW), since unlike the recently-arrived European honeybees, they evolved to pollinate under local conditions.

A friend who knew nothing about bees or beekeeping watched this with us, and she was disappointed since she didn't understand much of it - she wanted a little more basic information about bees and beehives.",1361145600,10,1274,4.554585152838428

4911061,5,B005ZMBDJK,"I found this documentary, like the others I've seen on the subject of bees, to be very affirmative, informative and cautionary. Besides being a fascinating presentation on all the man-made dangers facing the honeybee, this film leaves the viewer with a distinct point of view: it is our heavy reliance on factory farming and monoculture (one crop intensive agriculture) that poses the greatest threat to this critically important domestic insect and the ultimate survival of our food chain. Here are some of the important facts discussed in this testimonial to what bees do for us as cross-pollinators of crops, producers of honey and wax, and a harbinger of all that is fragile in our natural environment:
1. Swarming is a natural way in which hives and colonies are extended;
2. Millions of bees die annually from colony collapse;
3. The sweetness in honey can last for centuries;
4. The honey bee is responsible for maintaining up to 40% of the food chain;
5. Over 30 million bees are imported to the southeastern US every year to keep the orchards blossoming;
6. Australia is one of the world's largest exporters of bees;
7. Pesticides are a major toxic threat to the survival of the bee habitat.
8. Antibiotics used to treat bee populations can their way into humans through the consumption of honey;
9. It takes about 80-100 bee stings to kill a person;
10. Bees are one of a few species of insects where its males(drones)are programmed to devote themselves to propagating the line of the vrgin Queen in the hive or nest",1351814400,,1526,4.806083650190114

4911073,2,B005ZMBDJK,biodynamics have been used for thousands of years in agriculture. The people in the movie act as if they have invented something new. Getting poisoned is no fun whether you are an insect or human. A bit to groovy for my taste. The message will get lost on middle American types.  So the movie ends up preaching to the choir.  Why not interview an American beekeeper from lets say Tennessee where the basswood honey flows so prolific beekeepers pull of 80-100 lbs of honey per colony? They may not read or write well. They do not worship the Steiner approach because they have been living it for generations on there own. There was some good interviews and scenes but plenty of hot air by the Steiner proteges. Bee stings were the first acupunture. In the movie they are compared to rattlesnake bites. Not good. The chemical companies are powerful.  Usage of GMO's should never have been let out of bag without independent study. Wish movie would have tried to reach the average white bread American. It would have been more effective. I have kept bee's for over twenty years. The last seven without any chemicals or anti-biotics. Knowledge is power. Read up. The movie left out plenty though extremly well intended and beautiful.,1330387200,14,1229,4.76056338028169
4911074,5,B005ZMBDJK,"""Queen of the Sun:  What are the bees telling us?"" is the best documentary I have ever seen.  It literally changed my life.

So what are the bees telling us?  They are telling us not to use pesticides, artificial breeding, GMO's, and other industrial beekeeping practices such as transporting hives hundreds of miles and feeding bees corn syrup.  A combination of these practices are what is causing Colony Collapse Disorder and is killing the bees.  The things that are killing the bees are also killing the planet.  So the short answer is that the bees are telling us to support organic farmers and to boycott industrial agriculture.

I was a vegan for ethical reasons and ""Queen of the Sun"" showed me that organic beekeeping is not only ethical, it is beneficial to the species and the individual hives; so now I will support my local organic beekeepers by buying organic raw honey.

Before I saw ""Queen of the Sun,"" I had never had organic raw honey before.  I imagine most people have not had it either.  It is completely different from the clear syrup that you get at the grocery store.  It has a completely different look, texture, and taste.  Apparently it has a whole bunch of health benefits also.

I strongly urge you to see ""Queen of the Sun:  What are the bees telling us?""  Most of the film consists of interviews with organic beekeepers and it gives insight into these amazing creatures.

Even if you don't see ""Queen of the Sun:  What are the bees telling us?"" I urge you to pay a little extra for organic food and try some organic raw honey from your local beekeepers.  Bees are a ""keystone species.""  If they disappear, we will lose about a fourth of our crops.  We need to save the bees to ensure our own long term survival.",1330214400,9,1743,4.558064516129032
4911075,5,B005ZMBDJK,"We are very reactionary to bee's because they have been known for their painful sting. But do most of us understand just how reliant our ecosystem is on the pollinators we fear? This film starts at the beginning; exploring the roots and origin of beekeeping, and explaining their roll in creating the food that sustains us. The film draws on the expertise of entomologist, filed researchers, farmers, beekeepers, and political justices scholars to illustrate just how important and irreplaceable these stunning insects are. Unlike many very philosophically dense and heavy documentaries, 'Queen of the Sun: What are the Bees Telling Us?' leaves you feeling warm, uplifted, and likely interested in learning more about keeping bees.

8489807,5,B005ZMBDJK,"Yes, what you see on the cover is a woman dancing with bees all over her. How they got the bees to swarm like this is a mystery. ""Queen of the Sun"" is an intriguing journey into bee culture. We learn that bees are in danger and if we don't save the bees, we might likely not be able to save ourselves.

Bees are needed to pollinate crops and without them we'd be eating very few foods. In this documentary they show acres and acres of almond trees that need to be pollinated by transporting bees to California. If only they would plant some flowers and other plants there too this would not be necessary and bees could survive there.

The first few scenes of flowers in this documentary are gorgeous and there are plenty of scenes of beehives, honey and beekeepers working on the hives. Scientists, beekeepers and philosophers from around the world speak about the plight of bees. It is serious stuff and it seems hardly anyone is paying attention to the coming doom of humanity if bees all die. Apparently 50% of bees died in 2006!

This is really an emotional journey. I felt love, anger, sadness and joy while watching. You may literally cry at the beauty of bees. After watching you will know a little about colony collapse disorder that is threatening life on earth. After watching this movie I ate some honey with a new sense of reverence and respect.

I find the buzzing of bees very calming and keep lavender plants for them to visit during the summer. Even my cats enjoy watching them from the safety of the office window. I sometimes will just go outside and watch the bees buzzing around. Just being with bees is relaxing so I can see why so many people are beekeepers. You really do fall in love with bees if you observe them at work in the garden.

Hoping and praying for the best for bees,

The ideas presented here are based in part on the writings of Rudolph Steiner ( search 'Lectures on Bees' here on Amazon) who in the 1929's correctly predicted the state of our modern Bees as a result of agricultural changes taking place. I highly recommend reading those first.
