8416149,4,B0044LYRIC,"The box says 154 minutes. it's actually about only 45 minutes.(did I miss something?...I saw all the features mentioned on the box...? I see someone else made the same observation too. )  I had a horrific time loading this movie. the first time it took about 8 tries to get it to load, the second about 30 tries. The music for the feature film is all over the place...just anything that they can use, all sorts of jingles and tunes... but never really distracting.
The first movie has pretty good quality example and all in sepia tone. The anachronism is the hero and heroin meet on the Oregon trail in the late 19th century. then they meet again with 1920's cars in the picture and 1920's farm machinery, not aged a minute!..and the girl still single? The movie is a bit interesting in seeing farm work and machinery in use, even though only for a short bit. There were some illogical sequences... but the story was OK. but with the typical coincidental meetings of people that happen... just in time.
  The second ""movie"" (about 9 1/2 minutes) was a bit of a shock and a real hoot. The shock was it looked about 1930-35 with narration, but it's 1925! I mean They made a record to be played simultaneously with the movie! Isn't that what they did with Al Jolson and ""Mammy""?...considered to be the first talkie?, But this movie is a year or more older! It was an ok story, but the sound effects I thought were funny. Ok there weren't many ..maybe just the horse hoofs, but I thought they were a scream. There are no talking cards, just narration, a real different sort of ""silent"" era movie.",1397692800,,1592,4.482758620689655

8416151,4,B0044LYRIC,"I would have given this DVD a five star rating except that the running time is wrong on the box, and the ""bonus"" movie (""Revenge on the Range"") is really just a 10 minute featurette.

But the real hidden treasure here is ""The Old Oregon Trail"" from 1928 starring the wild and wooly Victor ""Art Mix"" Adamson. This independent, low budget film is his creation all the way. He wrote it, directed it, financed it, and starred in it. And it's wacky enough to actually be good. This film has a pretty good picture, okay backgound music, and a running time of 60 minutes.

Art Mix looks like a young Keith Carradine in a huge cowboy hat. His two saddle pals round out the heroic trio who come to the rescue of pretty, curly-topped Delores Booth and her father several times in the movie. Delores was Art's wife in real life.

The scenery in this film is breathtaking at times, and the action is always non-stop. This film makes a good introduction to the genre of low budget silent Westerns. And it's fun to ""listen"" to Art and his pals croon a song all the way through this silent movie without actually hearing it! So, saddle up, pards, and have some fun with ""The Old Oregon Trail.""",1314230400,3,1178,4.419354838709677
