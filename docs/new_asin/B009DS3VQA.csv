5321057,5,B009DS3VQA,"""George Gently"" Series 5 is another solid collection of period crime drama featuring Martin Shaw as aging crusader for justice DCI George Gently and Lee Ingleby as the slightly more tarnished and material DS John Bacchus. The year is 1968 in Northumberland and County Durham in Northern England. The Sixties are fully upon them, social change or a hunger for it- is evident all around, and Bacchus' sideburns seem to have grown. As usual, the cases revolve around social issues of the time: racism, music, the plight of unwed mothers, relationships between classes. In the last episode, Bacchus' loyalty is tested when old enemies at the Met try to destroy Gently's reputation and career. Bacchus has become an unpredictable character, as he still wears his prejudices on this sleeve and favors quick, pat conclusions, but he has also learned from his experiences. He wants to be on the side of the good guys but has trouble submitting himself to procedure.

The DVDs (Acorn 2013): Disc four includes a brief ""Behind the Scenes"" (3 min) bonus feature in which the cast is interviewed on the day of the cathedral scene. Optional English subtitles are available for all of the films, as are scene menus.

The episodes are:

In Newcastle, the body of a young black woman is found bludgeoned along the roadside in ""Gently Northern Soul."" DS Bacchus assumes that she was a prostitute, but Gently isn't so sure. The dead woman was Delores Kenny (Pippa Bennett-Warner) whose parents immigrated from Trinidad and Tobago. She had been out dancing at The Carlton hotel with best friend Carol Morford (Lenora Crichlow) the evening before, where a room is rented out to spin Northern Soul records all night. The dances were organized by the Gary Watts (Craig Conway), son of organized criminal Bernie (John Bowler) whose younger son Charlie (Philip Correia) was dating Delores. Delores' proud father Ambrose (Eamonn Walker) opposed the relationship, but not nearly as much as did Bernie Watts, who was the local leader of the anti-immigration movement. Racism casts a pall on the investigation, while Bacchus surprised himself with a romantic interest in Carol.

The body of charismatic young folk singer Ellen Mallam (Ebony Buckle) is found trapped underwater in a car in the river, her foot wedged so she could not escape, in ""Gently with Class."" The car is an Austin registered to local aristocrat Hector Blackstone (Roger Lloyd Pack), who has a collection of cars that are left with keys in the ignition. Bacchus immediately suspects Hector's son James (James Norton), whom he has arrested before for DUI, to be responsible and sees the opportunity to finally nail the troubled young man for something. Hector's wife, Countess Alethea (Geraldine Sommerville), is very class-conscious and openly contemptuous of the police investigation to the point of being obstructive. Bacchus returns the sentiment, and Gently suspects him of tampering with evidence to incriminate James. Ellen's gruff father Billy (Christopher Fairbank) works on the estate, and her bandmate Anthony (Nick Hendrix) also had access to the car.

Two month-old Faith is snatched from her crib on an idyllic Saturday afternoon in ""The Lost Child."" Frances (Helen Baxendale) and Stephen Groves (Mark Gatiss) are a middle-aged couple unable to have children who  adopted Faith from the Dunwoody home for unwed mothers. Suspicion initially falls on the child's biological mother, Susan Faulkner (Holly Lucas), who fled the home with her other twin infant Thomas. When DCI Gently and DS Bacchus question the home's proprietress Mrs. Esther Dunwoody (Alison Steadman), they find her a fastidious woman who likes to classify the babies and their mothers for prospective parents and who might not always adhere strictly to the law. When the Groves receive a ransom demand, attention turns to the couple's relationship. We meet Bacchus' father in this episode and learn that he shows little respect for his son's white-collar accomplishments.

A young patrol officer, Constable Gavin Henderson (Lee Armstrong), stumbles upon trouble when he investigates a couple of cars parked by the side of the road in ""Gently in the Cathedral."" Henderson is shot dead, and Gently promises his pregnant wife (Angelica Penn) that he won't give up on the case, even though authorities in London want to rule the death a suicide and accuse Henderson of taking bribes. An organized criminal whom Gently put behind bars, Melvyn Rattigan (Ralph Brown), is released pending a new trial after he claims that DCI Gently was on his payroll. Gently finds himself under investigation for corruption by the Serious Crime Squad, which lure Bacchus into helping with promise of a job interview. Gently visits his old acquaintance Gitta Bronson (Diana Quick), Ratigan's defense attorney seven years ago, to find out what she might know. Meanwhile, Bacchus struggles to figure out which officers are ""bent"", which are trustworthy, and who killed Henderson.",1497744000,,4976,5.173913043478261

  The most compelling elements are the conflict, character development, and (at times reluctant) companionship between the lead detectives, superbly acted by Martin Shaw and Lee Ingleby.  The plots raise cutting social / political / racial questions that were reaching the North of England in the 1960s.

Music has become more of a factor in these later Gentry films, this one with an evocative use of Motown-style music setting a tone for the era in the portrayal of an investigation of the murder of a young black woman.

We are now up to 1968, and this film includes a number of true historic moments along the way, setting the dates pretty specifically, from the assassination of Martin Luther King to Britain's Race Relations Act.

Showdowns occur with gunshots ripping the air and bullets rending flesh. Nowhere is safe. A bucolic farmyard is ripe for killing! Death may come at a huge cathedral where silenced gunshots are not heard by the choir singing hymnals while death stalks the holy space.

5321234,5,B009DS3VQA,"It is cause for rejoicing when another set of GEORGE GENTLY is released in North America by Acorn Media. And when the set contains fourcount em, fourfeature length mysteries, the anticipation is heightened even further.

This is one of those shows that is so good, everything comes to a stop so you can watch it.

The four feature-length episodes that comprise Series 5 are:

Gently Northern Soul
Gently With Class
The Lost Child
Gently In The Cathedral

One of the strengths of this superior series is the way relevant social issues of the 1960s are woven into the plots. Gently Northern Soul is a perfect example of this. Watching the always-wonderful Lee Ingleby go from having a typical (for the time) racist attitude towards black people to becoming more open-minded is another staple of this series. In other words, the characters grow. Bacchus (Ingleby) is initially skeptical about going undercover to investigate the murder of a young black woman. His attitude is subtly mocked when he is caught by Gently and a colleague practicing his dancing before setting out on his task (in an after hours club where many people of colour mix with whites). Ingleby looks ridiculous bopping about, a sort of penance for his limited view of people, initially. Like all the episodes, Gently Northern Soul is beautifully plotted and comfortably fills its 90 minute running time, leaving the viewer wanting more.

More 60s angst is explored in the second episode, Gently With Class, in which Gently and Bacchus investigate the tragic death of a beatiful and talented young lady from the lower class who has an uncomfortable relationship with an upper class family. The sparks really fly between Gently and Bacchus in this one and their respective positions on class prove central to the story. The class system is difficult for some North Americans to understand. Its basically the haves and have nots and it was in the 1960s that the unfairness of it all really came to a head in a significant way. This is another example of why GEORGE GENTLY is so outstanding: it really has its finger on the pulse of the times it is portraying.

Episode three is given a boost by the always wonderful Helen Baxendale playing the mother of an abducted baby. The plot twists in this episode are truly surprising and the outcome bittersweet. In each of these episodes Bacchus develops more and more into a character of real complexity. Gently remains rock solid (though never boringMartin Shaw is too good for that to happen) and the relationship between the two leads continues to be the backbone of the series.

Nothing gone before will prepare you for the whirlwind fourth episode which has a cliffhanger so tantalizing it will have you shouting at your TV/computer screen, demanding the immediate release of Series 6. Patience may well be a virtue but this excellent show has never been better. So, Acorn Media, if you're listening, we DEMAND Series 6 IMMEDIATELY, if you please!

GEORGE GENTLY is a classic series that stands above virtually every other police show currently on the air. More, please!",1397433600,,3084,4.90595009596929
5321235,5,B009DS3VQA,"This fifth season of George Gently -- which thankfully consists of four episodes rather than two -- maintains the high level of production values and acting that have characterized it from the start. We're now in the late 1960s, and Gently and his younger Sergeant Bacchus tackle cases involving everything from racism to aristocratic decline. The two leads and their supporting cast give magnificent performances, and as I watch the episodes, it's hard not to believe they were actually filmed during the period in question, the design and attention to detail are so good. I admit that this time around, a couple of the plots were confusing to me -- I felt some elements were left unexplained or raised more questions than they answered. Still, I couldn't keep my eyes from the screen. Highly, highly recommended.",1397088000,,814,4.992647058823529

5321237,5,B009DS3VQA,"Yes, there will be a Series Six George Gently - it began filming February 2014.  Now that we have that out of the way, how is Season Five?  Superb enough to live on for another year.  This series kicks off with a racial incident, capturing some of the tensions of the 1960's.  Another episode highlights the tension between the classes.  Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) plays the perfect ridiculous foil to the wise, patient and yes, gentle, Detective Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw).  John manages to be effective in spite of his antics, and George is his anchor and gives him a long leash.  Too long, some of us would say.  It's amazing John hasn't been fired, but he provides so much entertainment, George would probably hate to lose him.

This series has four episodes, and so does upcoming Series Six.  Fans of British mysteries should enjoy the realistic acting, fine scripts, British scenery and leisurely pace.  If you enjoyed previous seasons, the same quality is alive and doing well here.",1394841600,,1019,4.866279069767442

5321242,5,B009DS3VQA,"We hear a lot about the brilliance of current American TV series, especially on cable (some of it deserved, some of it the triumph of hype over substance), but you have to think the critics in the US watch only American TV when all you hear about, when talk turns to series from across the pond, is the predictable and boring Downtown Abbey. This crime series is more than the equal of anything on US TV. The understated camerawork and direction, the writing, the care over setting and period detail: all fantastic. And it gets better and better over time. Martin Shaw may not be up for an Emmy any time soon, but his performance as Gently is as good as any you'll see on the small screen right now, and a whole lot better than most you'll see on the big screen. Watch this as the best of British ""telly,"" and forget Downtown, and Game of Thrones, and all that crap. And the very best of Brit television is still on PBS (thank God for it), not on the increasingly American-geared, slick, and flashy BBCAmerica. Luther was also fabulous (BBCAmerica), but a lot of the rest loses all of qualities that makes Brit TV, at its best, so good, and gets right little of what American TV, at its best, equally as good.",1388966400,4,1209,4.401785714285714
5321243,5,B009DS3VQA,Great program that documents the 60s. Great acting and the plots are easy to follow. If you are a fan of British mysteries you need these.,1388707200,,138,4.346153846153846
5321264,5,B009DS3VQA,Another excellent installment on the series - gets darker and stronger with each season - plots deeper with Bacchus more and more torn between a moralist and a hypocrite.,1388620800,,170,4.896551724137931
5321265,5,B009DS3VQA,"George Gently manages to be different. On the surface, it is similar: set in the 1960s, with a younger, more foolish detective assisting him.

How is it different?

Brilliantly written, but not dwelling on witty one-liners, the characters are believable. Neither is perfect, but clearly, Inspector George Gently holds a higher moral and ethical standard than Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.

The cases themselves are ordinary enough -- usually murder with some interesting nuances. As it is set in the 1960s, the writers draw from the era for issues, police procedures and cultural milieu. While they aren't in the thick of protests and court cases, they are impacted from a distance just as anyone was then.

As is typical of British TV that makes it to the States, production values are high. Each episode is much like a movie, not rushing through plot points. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus develops show by show, never beyond the reality of each character. The viewer is always left satisfied by the show's end, waiting impatiently for the next one to be released.

I fully recommend George Gently.

It's great, although sadly it's not filmed in Durham or England, but in Ireland, it still has all the atmosphere and definately the accent of the area.  Set in the 60s it's very authentic too.

Poor Sgt. Bacchus (Lee Ingleby, brilliant) is the prat pretty often: if it's about race, he's the bigot (who learns better), for example. It seems as though his main job is to highlight Gently's general wonderfulness, but over the 5 seasons I have watched, the Sergeant has become a pretty good investigator, and Gently recognizes this, which makes the series even better, and indicates that somebody is working hard to make this series as good as it is.",1384992000,,624,4.841121495327103

5321315,4,B009DS3VQA,"I have long followed George Gently from his time at The Scotland Yard through his wife's death and onto his relocation to Northumberland. His DS, Jonathan Bacchus, played by Lee Ingleby, is immature, prejudiced and thinks he knows it all. Just when you want to shake him, he changes his behavior and starts to make sense. It must be that his mentor, George Gently, played by the inimitable Matin Shaw, has finally knocked some sense into him!

In the fifth series, we find them in the late 1960's, and  racism and changes that the 60's brought to the US, are seen in spades in the UK. In this fifth season, we have four episodes all about 75 minutes a piece. I have seen the first two episodes, and they are terrific.

Episode 1
A young black woman is found murdered. Northumberland is full of racism, and Gently is hopeful that new immigration laws will be passed. This is one area where Jonathan Bacchus shows he can have mature behavior.

Episode 2
A  beautiful young woman is found dead in the passenger seat of a car, apparently she died while struggling to get free. The detectives follow the trail to the home of local aristocrats. DS Bacchus has arrested the younger son several times and shows a great deal of resentment about the wealthy. Another episode where DS Bacchus thinks he knows it all.

I love the writing and top notch acting, and Martin Shaw can do no wrong. He is missing his wife dreadfully, and it may be time for someone new to enter the picture.

Taking place in the UK in the late 1960s, this season features topically appropriate themes (e.g., race relations, the British aristocracy system) built around, of course, a murder mystery.  This is a brilliantly written, acted, directed and produced series.

But nothing prepared me for year 5 of Inspector George Gently.  The entire series is magnificent, but these films, made in 2012, are totally superb.  Disc 2, ""Gently With Class,"" is the finest single performance I've ever seen in this genre.  Martin Shaw and Lee Ingleby are portraits in acting brilliance.  The direction and photography are uniformly excellent.  (See Durham, especially in the final selection.)  And don't forget the modern giant of television writing, Peter Flannery.

It's rather shocking and delightful to see this sort of creative genius at work in a Western culture that is dreadfully sick and no doubt dying.  George Gently isn't about explosions, car crashes, massacres, or simulated sex.  Imagine that: a truly adult, intelligent, and sensitive series of television dramas.

5321452,5,B009DS3VQA,"Dramatic HD cinematography. Packed suspense & cop action. 4 [cinema feature length] exciting episodes have different themes. Aristocrat family prejudice, racial conflict, revenge & greed each take a turn. Great adaptations of Alan Hunter crime novels, filmed in HD [great for Blu-ray fans.] All episodes show rural Durham England set in the year 1968. Fun period background music. I love all aspects of this copper series.

George Gently (Martin Shaw) is a fine copper, yet grieving widower of 4 years. His assistant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) displays a bit of a learning curve when it comes to correct police procedure. Together they get the job done, one way or another. This due has thrilled UK crime show fans since 2007 and a 2013 series is in production. Each season seems to get even better.
My favorite episode of all time is 2-Gently with Class, due to the music (see why below).

SDH SUBTITLES for this 2012 5th series of 4 episodes, each near 1  hours.
1...Gently Northern Soul--Black teen's death sends Gently and Bacchus seeking her murderer among a community rife with prejudice & anti-immigrant feelings. The UK locale is not unlike America in the racial restless `60s. The victim's dad played by Eamonn Walker (OZ).
2...Gently with Class--Young singer Ellen (Ebony Buckle) drowns in river accident, sending Gently & Bacchus to the aristocratic Blackstone family. Bacchus is prejudice in his investigation techniques. 1969 Chappaquiddick inspired? Ellen's pa played by Christopher Fairbank (Scarlet Pimpernel). The real star is the singing/fiddle playing of Ebony Buckle. A golden missed opportunity to add a bonus of her `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silver-Dagger/dp/B00BEL1A26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silver Dagger</a>' and `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matty-Groves/dp/B00BEQTK00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matty Groves</a>' songs. Click the names to link to MP3s. She does fantastic pub performances and as the dialogue says ""She made the angels weep.""
3...The Lost Child--Adopted baby is crib-napped from Stephen (Mark Gatiss- ""Sherlock"") and Frances Groves (Helen Baxendale- ""Friends""). Was it the birth mom, an act connected to past secrets, or crime by chance? A psychological probe.
4...Gently in the Cathedral--Bailed criminal Rattigan (Ralph Brown- ""Life on Mars"") is set on revenge. Will young Bacchus support or deny claims that Gently is a murderer? Diana Quick (Brideshead Revisited) is a lawyer, Kevin Whately (Inspector Lewis) a retired copper, and Nigel Lindsay (Clatterford) is a Serious Crimes cop credited playing DCS Trevor Statham, but in the episode he introduces himself to Bacchus as DI Reese Statham. A tiny error lost among all of the action of this episode, even a desperate fight inside beautiful Durham Cathedral. The final scene leaves suspense hanging till the season 6 broadcasts.

George Gently series began well in 2007 and has raised the bar ever since. Competes in quality to Midsomer Murder, especially with the two-generational leading characters. Of course there is crime violence and blood, it is murder investigations, but suitable for older teens through adults.

His young sidekick, John Bacchus, is sometimes a little irritating and not always totally convincing as a hard-nosed cop, but well-played by Lee Ingleby.

Thankfully, Series Five actually provides FOUR episodes, not the measly two as in Series 3 & 4! Series Five ends on a disturbing note, cliffhanger, where the fate of our main characters is unsure. But rest assured, another four episodes are being filmed in 2013. There are English subtitles, for those of us who do not want to miss one word. The run time is 354 minutes, plus a 3 minute bonus ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette; for a three-dimensional taste experience, you may want to indulge in some Northumberland style bangers & mash, with classic Newcastle Nut Brown Ale (a favorite of Bacchus') to top it off. Enjoy!

Episode 1, ""Gently Northern Soul""
Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4th, 1968. Later that month, in Northumberland, 1968, the shadow of racist tension lurks, although young people are keen to get into a dance club where they can thrill to imported soul music. When a beautiful young black girl, Dolores Kenny (Pippa Bennett-Warner), is murdered after a night out, DCI George Gently (Martin Shaw) and Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) discover not only ""racialism"" within the police force, but strong anti-immigrant feelings. Bacchus winds up falling for Delores' friend Carol Morford (the wonderful Lenora Crichlow,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Human/dp/B005GP7ELM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Human</a>). Delores' father, Ambrose Kenny (Eamon Walker), is a WWII vet, now bus-driver, who has valiantly fought racism all his life, his son Joseph (Gary Carr) is less patient than his father. Yet beneath these tensions, other motivations may have been responsible for the murder. Gently and Bacchus fight to untangle a web of violence, while in one scene, a telly broadcasts the notorious ""Rivers of Blood"" speech. Weaving history and mystery, the Race Relations Act 1968, immanent in 1968, this is a topical, courageous story, with classic soul music.

Episode 2, ""Gently with Class""
British drama and mystery series often delve into frank discussions about ""class."" In this story, also set in Northumberland, 1968, a blue Austin A40 Farina, registered to local aristocrat, Hector Blackstone (the wonderful Richard Lloyd Pack, in ""Doc Martin"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vicar-of-Dibley/dp/B004M244OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vicar of Dibley</a>), turns up crashed in a river. In the passenger seat is a drowned, beautiful young woman, and no driver is found. It seems that a local girl was abandoned to drown in the river alone, with no help from her date. It turns out that the victim was gifted musician and free-spirit Ellen Mallam (Ebony Buckle). Against the will of Hector's second wife, Countess Alethea Blackstone, Ellen had been involved with the Countess' son and heir-apparent, Lord James Blackstone. Ellen's father (wonderfully played by Christopher Fairbank), dying of throat cancer, is suspected when James is in hospital. Gently is furious when he discovers that Bacchus crossed a line due to his dislike for the Blackstone's snobbery and obstruction. Meanwhile, Gently, like Hector Blackstone, is haunted by the loss of his wife, plagued by dreams of drowning.

Episode 3, ""The Lost Child""
Camera gently panning a street in Durham, 1968, postwar families enjoy a ""lovely life."" Children play on sidewalks, mothers walk baby-filled prams, front yards are meticulously maintained, and nary a rose is out of place. This bucolic setting is suddenly disturbed when baby Faith is snatched from her crib, from her ""perfect"" home. She had been adopted three weeks ago by respectable, middle-class Stephen Groves and his wife Frances (pitch-perfectly played by Helen Baxendale). Suspicion initially falls on the birth mother, Susan Faulkner (luminous with Holly Lucas), whose heart is breaking for her lost daughter whilst she and her other baby, Faith's twin brother Thomas, find refuge by the sea with her friend Hazel Joyce (another gem, Faye Castelow). George Gently and John Bacchus discover that Susan had misgivings about putting her child up for adoption in the first place, and that both Susan and Hazel have reason to dislike the adoption agency's Mrs. Dunwoody (the always excellent Alison Steadman). Further investigation rolls across gorgeous Northumbrian moors, and our George (ex-boxer) makes a delightful threat against a suspect who'd better not try to abscond; a ransom note turns out to be blackmail. The Groves, Faith's well-off adoptive parents, come under suspicion. A mysterious young fellow named Gareth (Jordan Dawes) turns up, to tragic consequences. Meanwhile, George Gently expresses compassion to John Bacchus, who is trying to resolve old tension with his hyper-critical father Peter (the wonderful Tony Haygarth) and balance his relationship with his daughter Leigh Ann (young Katie Anderson is delightful, and Lee Ingleby works beautifully with her). Another fine episode, and clearly, the set designers, from clothes to props, had a ball.

Episode 4, ""Gently in the Cathedral""
In Durham, 1968, the forces of evil that tragically disrupted George Gently's life in 1964 re-emerge in this dark season closure. A young, newly married police officer, Gavin Henderson (Lee Armstrong), is murdered, leaving his pregnant wife Bernie (beautifully played by Angelica Penn) in dire straits. The force believes the death was suicide, so she can't rely on a pension or insurance for support. George Gently stands by her and tries to help, whist she moves to Rothbury. Meanwhile, Melvin Rattigan (Ralph Brown), a violent, notorious career criminal, is released from Durham Gaol early, after years of planning his revenge upon DCI Gently. Another criminal is found dead, but was he who he appeared to be, a bad bloke named Rivers? Our George made a number of enemies in his relentless pursuit of truth; he unearthed a myriad of police corruption during his career at the Met in London (and beyond). Foes have now cleared Rattigan on the grounds that any evidence against him was falsely concocted by Gently. Another detective is found murdered, D.S. Bill Denmore, turns out he was working undercover. In Durham, an old colleague, Donald McGhee (Kevin Whately, of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Lewis/dp/B00C12ZISE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Lewis</a>) arrives, and soon after, George is accused of money fraud and murder, his world begins to crumble around him as the Fraud Squad entices DS John Bacchus (the great Lee Ingleby, also in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Street/dp/B005N8KP3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Street</a>)to provide evidence against his boss. A job at the Met is used to entice his ambition, and Bacchus' loyalty is tested to the limit. At least the tea and biscuit proffering DC Taylor (Simon Hubbard) defies the bullying, as does Bachuss' ex-wife Lisa (played with perfect-pitch by Melanie Clark Pullen). Gently is suspended, left in vulnerable position while he must face the past and fight for his reputation and his life. Ironically, one sanctuary is with Rattigan's defense lawyer, Gitta Bronson (the great Diana Quick, also in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Case-Histories-Series-2/dp/B00A27OJ94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Case Histories - Series 2</a>), and her delightful, eccentric butler Tim (Philip Fox). Gently must fight for his life against deep-seated corruption in a classic cliff-hanger episode. Martin Shaw as DCI George Gently delivers some of the most masterful acting you'll ever see. Even the cinematography (by Ulf Brantas) is superb, note the scene towards the denouement, with Gently contemplating the crisis before entering Durham Cathedral.

5321476,5,B009DS3VQA,"I was not familiar with the Inspector George Gently series until PBS started running the Series - 1 thru 4  - this year.  Each episode is better than the last because as one gets a taste of the quality of the man played spectacularly by Martin Shaw, the era and times of the 60's authentically represented along with his quirky, yet perfectly cast, side-kick, Inspector Bacchus, the programs become of great viewing value along with being very entertaining at times.  As the stories unfold, we learn about the  dignity of Inspector Gently, his unwillingness to accept corruption along with his attempt to create a safe sane and sound world.  I think the Inspector George Gently episodes should be made required watching for teenagers - for I've not seen a better role model, ever.  You won't be disappointed with Inspector George Gently.",1359763200,,837,4.900709219858156

5321481,5,B009DS3VQA,I could watch George Gently over and over again.  The characters are very well done and I would watch Martin Shaw in anything.  The only thing I would change about this series is that it is way past time for his partner to grow up.  I'm getting tired of his whining.  The crime stories are unique and I appreciate that they are not too graphic.  Love this series!,1356652800,27,363,4.279411764705882
5321482,5,B009DS3VQA,"in uk television, you simply cannot lose with martin shaw in the lead role.  this is his fifth season as chief inspector george gently, who now solves murders out in the sticks in 1960s england.  he was formerly of london.  his sidekick out in the sticks is a young man whose heart is in the right place but who needs some maturing and seasoning, all of which george provides, five season&iacute;s in, the episodes are every bit as good.

note: the novels are very different from the tv show,  i bought one in the kindle store and the only similarity is that they are mystery novels about a uk police inspector who solves murders.

i highly recommend all five seasons of this series.
