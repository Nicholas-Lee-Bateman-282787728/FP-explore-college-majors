8188243,4,B000P1KRO8,"This is an interesting DVD about a Outlaw MC from California that Sonny Barger mentioned in his book "" Hell's Angel."" The DVD is a documentary about the Hessians and the history of the club is given through the memories of its members who are all middle aged to senior citizens now. Some of the members are personable and there stories are humorous. They don't seem like outlaws now but they had a feared reputation in their day. The club is on its way to oblivion now that its members are dying off. There are not many young people joining the club and the members are still very selective of who they will admit as prospects. It is nice to see that some people still have pride and high standards in today's world and would rather their club become extinct than accept members who can't meet the original criteria one had to meet to become a Hessian.",1287878400,9,852,4.43312101910828
8188244,5,B000P1KRO8,"It is worth the price of this DVD just to hear one of the Hessians tell of the time he had to get another club member to finish his city bus route because he was too wasted on dope to figure out where he was supposed to go next!

These guys might be old, and the club might be on the downward slope, but they sure as hell ain't H.O.G. members! They ride, and probably still kick ass if need be.....",1261267200,8,398,3.9135802469135803
8188245,3,B000P1KRO8,"This DVD, although cheaply made, is somewhat entertaining. If you are just dying to watch a DVD about an outlaw motorcycle club, this is ok. The Hessian club itself is dying, both literally and figuratively. All the members and, subsequently, the interviewees are in their 60s now and are no longer hell raisers. They still wear the leathers, patches and ride around, which is cool and I hope they never stop. It was fairly sad to see the club in such pitiful state. On the bright side, the guys are funny and have thousands of entertining stories to share. The DVD does have a lot of really cool pictures and images from all through the years and gives you a nice sense of their history. The producer also included a lot of newspaper clippings and interviews from government agencies that present a rounded depiction of the club, that is, you hear both sides. It was not what I expected, but I did enjoy it.",1242172800,14,908,4.5426829268292686
