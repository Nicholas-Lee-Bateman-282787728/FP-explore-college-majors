3986976,5,B002U1PAT8,"I have been a bluegrass music fan all my life. I had heard of the Kruger Brothers through publications like Bluegrass Unlimited, but never paid much attention to them. Then I heard them, and everything changed.

It was at a bluegrass festival in New York State about three years ago where I first heard their amazing music -- not always bluegrass, but always amazing music. I was stunned at the musicality, inventiveness and breadth of their music, and have been a ""fanatical fan"" ever since. I've seen them anytime they play in the Northeast, and even flew halfway across the country last summer to see them perform in Branson Missouri.

I have had a banjo for most of my life, and have tried off and on to learn to play it with little success. I've tried several different books, video lessons, and even live teachers, but always felt that I was meant to be a listener, not a player.

Then I got the Jens Kruger Banjo Method for Beginners DVD, and everything changed, in a matter of days. Jens, and his brother Uwe are musical geniuses, so it shouldn't be a surprise that they know how to teach. But they way Jens goes about it is unmatched by anyone else: The difference is that he teaches you how to play the MUSIC. Others concentrate on teaching how to play the notes. And there is a huge difference between the two.

Jens, always with a smile on his face and a self-deprecating manner, helps you figure out how to find the melody (any melody, not just bluegrass) and pick it out on one string. He teaches you how to hear and play the scales, and shows you how those notes on the scales are the building blocks for the songs. It works, folks. It really works. If you have an ear for music, you can learn the basics of the banjo from Jens [with backup from Uwe and Joel].

I could go on and on about this, but hopefully you get the drift. I've never written a review of any product before, but feel so strongly about this DVD that I thought I'd share my enthusiasm with others.

8380874,5,B002U1PAT8,"You may already know how to play banjo like Earl Scruggs or you may not, but this DVD will introduce you to a whole new philosophy for playing the banjo.  Jens Kruger can coax some of the most beautiful music out of a five string banjo that I've ever heard, and yet he makes it seem so easy.  He gives you the greatest pointer I've heard yet for playing, and that is to have fun doing it. You may or may not incorporate Jen's banjo style into your own, but even so, it was just pure pleasure to sit, watch and listen as Jen Kruger taught his style and philosophy for playing and for living.",1464134400,,590,4.121739130434783
