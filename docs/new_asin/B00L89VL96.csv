6473963,4,B00L89VL96,"Very happy that these are on DVD now. The nostalgia factor is definitely present. The picture quality pales in comparison with modern shows, but that shouldn't take away from enjoying the actual episodes. I'd love to see some special features in future seasons!",1404518400,13,261,5.093023255813954
6473964,5,B00L89VL96,The quality of the episodes is really surprising! It's at least as good if not better than how they looked back in the day. Thank you Amazon for finally giving us a release of this show stateside! It still holds up after all these years with some genuinely spooky thrills 'n chills. Bring on the rest of the seasons! I need them all!,1404259200,26,333,4.301587301587301
6473965,5,B00L89VL96,"I hope this will be followed by all of the other seasons. This show was always fun to watch back when I was a kid in the '90s. It is great to see it released as a full season, and not just a volume with a few episodes. Thanks Amazon!",1403740800,24,233,3.68
6473966,5,B00L89VL96,This is a show I loved as a child and Im happy I found it here!,1527120000,,63,3.0
6473967,5,B00L89VL96,"I was a fan of this series as a kid, so I loved this set. If you are not already a fan (and are over the age of 12) you may find it cheesy. Mild horror with slapstick camera shots - good Friday-night fun! The discs and packaging are high quality and arrived quickly.",1527033600,,266,3.9444444444444446
6473968,4,B00L89VL96,"I don't think all these episodes are going to all be awesome for some. Here's my opinion guys.

Disc. 1

""The Tale Of The Phantom Cab"" - Great story, opens strong. Spooky, cool, suspenseful. 5/5
""The Tale Of Laughing In The Dark"" - Classic one, scary, Zeebo the clown is badass, spooky. 5/5
""The Tale Of The Lonely Ghost"" - It's mostly boring, nothing really happens. The ending is really good though. 3/5
""The Tale Of The Twisted Claw"" - Very cool one, suspenseful, interesting. 5/5
""The Tale Of The Hungry Hounds"" - Boring, weak, weird, forgettable. 1/5
""The Tale Of The Super Specs"" - I don't love it, I don't hate it either. 3/5
""The Tale Of The Captured Souls"" - It's ok, watch it once and that's it. 2/5

Disc. 2

""The Tale Of The Nightly Neighbors"" - I thought this one was going to be really good, boring one. 2/5
""The Tale Of The Dark Music"" - Awesome one, I really like this one a lot. 5/5
""The Tale Of Jake and the Leprechaun"" - It's ok, I wish the Horror movie Leprechaun was in it instead. 2/5
""The Tale Of The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" - The creepy snake cane was cool, everything else sucked. 1/5
""The Tale Of The Prom Queen"" - A really good one, it's more of a peaceful ghost story. 5/5
""The Tale Of The Pinball Wizard"" - I liked the creepy men in black guys but, after that it became lame and cheesy. 2/5",1524528000,2,1318,4.239043824701195

6473979,1,B00L89VL96,"This is what happens when one person is the director, writer and producer.  I never saw this show before ordering, but it looked promising when I checked it out on Amazon Video.  Even though it is more suitable for kids, the stories were terrible.  I have other shows suitable for kids that are better than this like ""The Haunting Hour.""  This gives new meaning to terrible and boring.  I can't believe children would want to watch this.",1514246400,,437,4.623376623376624

6473984,4,B00L89VL96,"Absolutely cheesy 90's Nickelodeon fun that... shockingly... ends up unsettling, haunting and sometimes outright terrifying.

6473994,3,B00L89VL96,"I'm pleased to be able to rewatch one of my favorite shows from my childhood, but I think Nickelodeon really could have done more in these releases. For one, they are DVD-R's, not true DVD's (some media players may not play DVD-R's). This is just a way for Nick to maximize profits, but devalues Nick's adult fan base.

The media quality is pretty much as basic as it gets. The menu screen is bare bones-- there isn't even any music in the background. There are no bonus extras, commentary, etc. And why haven't they made the 6th and 7th seasons? Again, I'm happy to see the show and now be able to watch it whenever I please, but these DVD's could have been so much better.",1497052800,4,674,4.349206349206349

6474002,4,B00L89VL96,"I loooooooove this show. And with this package, you're getting the entire first season. So, is it worth it?

The Good:
Season one had some great episodes. The stories are still gripping, and it looks exactly like it did in the 90s. These are much better versions than the bootleg sets you can sometimes find online or at conventions that are just copies from someone's vcr recordings. The season boxes loom great, and very cool sitting on a dvd rack next to the other seasons.

The bad: These episodes would greatly benefit from some color polishing. The episodes are dark, and not always easy on the eye. I'd pony up for a bluray color treatment version if they would make one. The episode selection screen is very generic, and there are no extras.

I'm giving these 4 stars. The episodes on this disc are very good, and it had a few of my favorite episodes in the entire series run. It was definitely worth the price, and makes it very clear that it's worthwhile to pick up the remaining seasons. I would give it 5 stars, but the show does look dated and really could have used a little visual polishing.",1487894400,4,1106,4.492537313432836

6474024,4,B00L89VL96,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the quality isn't great. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it just doesn't seem to be DVD quality. The quality of the picture didn't bother me as much as the quality of the sound. I had to turn the volume up almost all the way on my TV to be able to hear the dialogue which made the background music too loud at times. This is a brand new TV and I tried it on a different one as well so I know the TV isn't the issue. The case is just a standard DVD case, not leathery like it appears in the picture but that didn't bother me. Other than that I'm completely happy with my purchase.

The stories are great and while the child actors are child actors (terrible) it really was as good as when I saw it as a kid. Actually probably more enjoyable now that I am an adult.  If you love camp fire stories or interesting 90's shows give it a watch.  It aged well and is actually kind of impressive to see how creative, campy and sometimes downright creepy the show was.... it would be perfect if the child actors could believably scream with terror!",1460592000,3,697,4.257575757575758

The first season, hands down, is the best and features some of the creepiest episodes of the entire season, including the iconic episode The Tale of the Laughing in the Dark. The only clunker of these thirteen episodes is The Tale of Jake and the Leprechaun. The DVD itself is very no frills but I did like the cover and there is a way to play all the episodes on a disc without having to choose each time.

On top of this, theres no music to the Menu, no real menu now, and the picture they put up in its place is really lame.  Probably the biggest drawback is the worthless insert/case/cover for each season that looks like it cost 20 cents to make.- not anything even close to the awesome three way fold out sets of the Original Retail Seasons!

6474089,5,B00L89VL96,"Update: It looks like most users are still receiving burned discs, so maybe I just got lucky. The rest of my review still applies, but I wouldn't bet on getting a pressed disc when you order.

I ordered this a month or so ago, and finally got to try it out. I imported the Canadian re-release of season 1 and 2 about a year ago, so my review will mostly be comparing the two home video releases themselves.

First, I would like to say that despite what Amazon implies in the listing, this was NOT a DVD-R release. The item I received came with a pressed disc, which was a big plus for such an inexpensive set. I think I paid just over $20 USD for the Canadian release which made it almost twice the $12 I paid for this one.

The video from both releases looks great, and I didn't really see either release as being stronger than the other. Both are surprisingly sharp and have good color, considering the original footage. Each picture is a bit noisy, but that's kind of to be expected. I don't have an adequate system to compare the audio of each release, but the Canadian release does have the benefit of being bilingual.

Both releases have the episodes out of order on the disc, making it a bit awkward to watch the set as a series. This release, however, does feature the episode titles in the menu, whereas the Canadian release does not.

So, taking all of these things into consideration, unless you need a bilingual or french language release, the Amazon release is a steal at the current price. This release is as good, and in some cases better than the Canadian release.

Judging from other reviews, it seems that not all discs come pressed as mine did, so there is perhaps a bit of a gamble. I would assume that Amazon is transitioning to pressed discs for at least the 1st season of this series, but there may still be some old copies lying around that get shipped out first. I also can't speak for whether the other seasons are pressed, or merely burned. So, buy this release with that in mind.

Also, it has this lame Nickelodeon intro or outro that is on every episode.  This could have been played when the disc was inserted rather than attached to every episode.

6474139,3,B00L89VL96,"Please note: The rating is only impacted by the design of the DVD Packaging, not the quality of the show.

I purchased this from a collector's standpoint. I'm in hopes that I will be able to find all of the seasons with similar cases. *****PLEASE BE AWARE***** The image you see represents a DVD case. The case itself is not leathery as it appears. It's a standard DVD case. I thought I'd be getting a nice packaged, well thought out DVD to add some spark to my entertainment collection, but I was deceived.

It's alright though as the show is still amazing.
Going back and watching episodes now compared to my childhood, I realize just how ""ahead of it's time"" the production was. There are some cheesy moments, well... a lot of them, but there are some special effects in this show that surpass what is being done with modern technology.

It's amazing to see how creative things can be when you're on a limited budget. I think that's what keeps this raw, and true to the story telling.
All in all there are still a few episodes that will creep you out.

This is a great item to use when prepping for the mood of halloween, or JUST ALL YEAR LONG!
You can't go wrong with the shows from the 90's.

Good times.
Good morals.
Excellent story telling.

MUST BUY for entertainment!
