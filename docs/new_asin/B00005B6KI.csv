1421482,2,B00005B6KI,"5 DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON is said to be Mario Bava's worst film & I couldn't agree more. It looked like Bava didn't care about this movie at all. Sure, it had style to spare cause it's by Bava, but for the most part, this movie is just plain boring. The only saving graces of this film is the colorful direction, beautiful women, & some sleek & stylish visuals.
Unless you're a serious Bava fan, this movie may not be for you.",1027987200,3,427,4.156626506024097
1421483,5,B00005B6KI,"It is surely no coincidence that the two greatest adaptations of Agatha Christie (Rene Clair's 'And then there were none' and this) have been by directors who might be loosely called Surrealist, and have been based on the same book, 'Ten Little Indians', in which the traditional emblem of consciousness in the crime novel, the detective, is removed, allowing the unconscious free rein.  'Five Dolls for an August Moon' is not often rated as highly as Bava's horror films, but I think it might be his masterpiece, the murder mystery as Bunuellian bad dream.  a number of couples are invited by magnate George Stark to his island retreat, as cover for his attempts to force a brilliant scientist to sell some secret formula that is worth millions but potentially dangerous.  the increasingly tense atmosphere soon becomes the backdrop for a series of grotesque murders.
There is something of 'the Tempest' about 'Five dolls', with its enchanted island (seemingly pivoted around the title moon), a presiding power manipulating everyone's movements and an Ariel-like figure flitting freely and decisively on the margins.  but it is Bunuel who is the true guiding spirit - like the party-goers in 'The Exterminating Angel', Bava's bourgeoisie can't leave their opulent surroundings, and their elegant facade is soon stripped away to reveal sexual neurosis, financial greed and violence (lingering traces of fascism in the bright new democratic, industrial Italy, and all prominent in the brutal George); while, like 'Belle de Jour', the mystery narrative is subverted by a complex pattern mixing dream, subjective point-of-view and reality - one amazing sequence sees the survivors magically disappearing when potential rescuers arrive on the island.
As ever, the house is central to Bava's vision, in this case a gorgeously gleaming, futuristic, spacious white interior, reworked into kaleidoscopic shapes by Bava's prowling camera, his quickswitch, wide-angle tilts and his use of deep deep-focus.  the Hammond-dominated soundtrack is one of those infectious masterpieces seemingly de rigeur in the Euro-B-movies of the time, and so badly lacking in these gloopy, over-orchestrated times.  the missing formula is more than a McGuffin: a powerful symbol for the absence (emotional, moral etc.) debilitating these awful characters.  Surveillance is another prominent Bava theme, the all-seeing, unseen eye watching our every move in modern society - in this case the act of spying/looking/viewing and the act of killing are explicitly linked in a moment of Hitchcockian frisson.",1004918400,13,2574,5.43609022556391
1421484,4,B00005B6KI,"Although Bava said this was his worst film, ""Five Dolls..."" is now enjoying a much deserved re-appraisal. When I saw a washed-out 35mm print some years ago, I was inclined to agree with the director's opinion, but the DVD release has laid any doubts I may have had to rest. The unusually framed compositions, frenetic zip-panning, intrusive zooms and gaudy colours give the film a psychedelic Eurotrash ambience that is difficult to resist. The unconvincing characterizations and hackneyed plot are lost in a welter of striking incidental details: hundreds of glass baubles rolling down a staircase and into the bloody water of a suicide victim's bathtub, being a particularly impressive example. The kitschy easy-listening soundtrack compliments the visuals perfectly, humorously underscoring the hanging of the corpses in the freezer with childishly sinister fairground music. The English dubbed track seems suffers from occasional irritating crackles, so I suggest you enjoy this garish ""10 Little Indians"" variant in Italian with English subs. Riddled with loose ends, it's not one of Bava's most substantial movies, but it's by no means devoid of the classic, unusual touches that are associated with his name.",996969600,16,1215,5.4338624338624335
1421485,4,B00005B6KI,"Mario Bava has taken a step back to his horror genre and created a psychadelic, mysterious, sexy, black comedy.  The film is TERRIBLY dated to the late 60s/early 70s. (The girls look like they just walked out from the 'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls' set).  But DON'T let that stop you from viewing this VERY original piece of film !
The plot is simple:  A group of married friends are on a 'getaway' weekend and they find themselves being killed off one by one.  THATS IT !  Sounds like a ""Ten Little Indians"" clone, right ????  Wrong !  You have the brutality of ""Fargo"" in some spots and the wickedly DARK comedic moments as in ""Pulp Fiction"".  If you liked both of those films, you will enjoy this little seen Bava masterpiece.  The music is TOTALLY 60s, the outfits are right out of the Jimi Hendrix thrift store, and the stage sets look like a 'hippie' Brady Bunch dwelling.  Its a FUN movie !
Without a doubt:  This was WAY before its time.  Very enjoyable !  Even though its not HORROR, (its more of a  mystery), this is a MUST for Bava fans !",992304000,19,1051,4.323076923076923

The editing and camerawork is fabulous, the story line is very original and the art direction is simply quite the best of all his films. Not bad for a movie shot in only three weeks with virtually no budget!",1490745600,,362,4.185714285714286

Not the world's most sophisticated or intricate murder mystery, but pure eye candy from start to finish. Proves Bava was a total master of cinematography. I can watch and pause scenes for days in this movie.",1484956800,,296,4.94
7937097,1,B00005B6KI,"5 Bambole per la Luna d'Agosto (Five Dolls for an August Moon) (Mario Bava, 1970)

Every few years, I sit down with another Mario Bava movie to see if I can finally get a glimpse of what so many of my friends see in this guy's movies. Every time, I fail. I've seen a few Bava films I'd call watchable, none I'd call great, and a bunch about which the kindest thing I can say is that they're awful. Five Dolls for an August Moon falls into the last category.

The basic idea (I'm not sure I would go so far as to call it a plot): George Stark (The Blonde Connection's Teodoro Corr&aacute;), a wealthy industrialist, invites some friends and their lovely wives (I could run down a list of names here, but the only one you really need to know is Algerian ultra-hottie Edwige Fenech) out to his private island for a weekend of fun, games, drinking, dancing, that sort of thing. All well and good until they discover there is a serial killer in their midst. Cue amateur detection, people losing their clothes on a fairly regular basis, and a couple of folks who deal with the stress of their imminent demise by...playing chess. (Why that struck me as the most ridiculous thing about this movie is beyond me, but it did.)

When I ask people what it is about Mario Bava's movies that excites them so, the general answer I get has something to do with his style of filmmaking. I've never heard anyone actually define it, however, and I'm sure if I were to attempt such a thing I'd be branded a heretic and burned at the stake by a legion of Barbara Steele aficionados, so I'll avoid it. I can tell you that it doesn't have the sort of stylistic excess that Argento, Fulci, and their giallo contemporaries had already started dabbling in (1970 was the year Argento released The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, probably his first true venture into giallo; Fulci, the same year, was in the process of filming the movie that would make him, too, a giallo superstar, A Lizard in a Woman's Skin, released in 1971); if anything, it plays like a straightforward murder mystery with a few half-hearted attempts at humor thrown in for (good? not really) measure. Usually when I see Bava films, they're dubbed, and I am usually willing to throw in some benefit of the doubt that less-than-stellar dubbing could be part of my problem with the movie in question, but this one was subtitled, so I can't even pull out that excuse.

This would seem to be a minor film in the Bava canon (it has just over a thousand IMDB votes as I write this in November 2013, while, for example, Black Sunday has about 7,000), and after watching it I can understand why. I'd recommend this one only for hardcore fans of the director or, of course, Edwige Fenech, who as usual gets appealingly bare on occasion. Others can safely avoid, and in fact will be better off for doing so. *",1385596800,,2841,4.457692307692308
7937098,3,B00005B6KI,"Italian director Mario Bava (1914-1980) delved into several genres, including horror, suspense, and westerns.  His film Five Dolls For An August Moon (1970) falls more in the mystery and suspense category, as a group of friends and business associates, are on an island when a series of strange murders takes place.  There are five prominent female characters, but like many Italian horror films and giallos, the film's title is still rather cryptic.  This movie also goes by the more appropriate title of ""Island of Terror"".  Whatever you call it, not a lot makes sense, but the surreal atmosphere, weird happenings, and exotic women, makes for some interesting viewing.

Wealthy George Stark (Teodoro Corra) invites some of his friends and their wives to his island, to meet Professor Gerry Farrell (William Berger) who has invented a revolutionary kind of synthetic resin, worth a fortune.  Three men are interested in financially backing the Professor, and write checks for a million dollars apiece.  But the man of science says he needs a vacation more than money, and declines to sell his secret formula.

The murder of a houseboy begins a string of garish deaths.  When the group finds that they are unable to summon the authorities, they wrap in the body in plastic sheeting, and store it in a refrigerated meat locker.  Farrell is the next to go, but his body mysteriously vanishes.  Not a lot of progress is made in narrowing down who the killer may be, and the meat locker soon begins to fill up with bodies, to the tune of some eerie carousel music.

The various attractive women, their wardrobe, and sexual forays are a point of interest, but there is nothing graphic, and only brief nudity.  Still behaving as if they are on a holiday, the characters don't do much except make love, before suddenly turning up dead, usually killed off screen in mostly sterile ways.  Only when the herd is thinned down, do things get really serious, bringing the island adventure to a close.  Exactly what happens isn't completely clear, as there are some blanks that aren't quite filled in, but the film does have a bright upbeat ending.

With little or no creative control, Mario Bava reported regarded Five Dolls For An August Moon as one of his least favorite efforts, and it wasn't released in the USA until 2001, over twenty years after his death.  Bava may not have been enamored with the film, but it is well shot and still worth viewing for its style, 70's fashions, soundtrack, pretty women, surreal atmosphere, and a few tense moments.

The 2001 version is in Italian with English subtitles.  The 2007 version of the film, features an English dub, and is included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bava-Box-Set-Vol-2/dp/B000UVV23S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bava Box Set, Vol. 2</a>, where the film is on the flipside with Four Times That Night (1972) another offbeat Bava effort.  Watching the English dub with the English subtitles makes for some interesting viewing, as they often are quite divergent.",1311206400,,3064,5.102204408817635
7937099,3,B00005B6KI,"Most of the reviews I've seen for this film (on Amazon.com and other sites) are written by Bava fans. I purchased the movie because I am a fan of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians/And Then there Were None. 5 Dolls For an August Moon is often compared to Christie's story and in many respects this is an accurate comparison. The plot closely mimics Christie's story and serves as a fairly well executed murder mystery. But the characters seem to respond oddly to the actual crimes. This is not an overly gory movie, in fact none of the murders are actually shown and the resultant corpses are, by in large, not shocking in appearance. However, it is acreepy/eerie film. For example the bodies in the freezer is a just a bit unnerving.

While I enjoyed the movie, I had the sense that this is a film in search of an identity. It doesn't seem to ""know"" what it wants to be. On the one hand it is a very well shot, scenic movie. The island location is quite beautiful. The scenery is just really very, very pretty, almost tranquil. In many respects 5 Dolls comes across with an art film feel to it.

The reason I say 5 Dolls is disjointed is because you don't get the sense that Bava really knew what he wanted to do with this movie. On the one hand it is a serviceable mystery with somewhat stilted acting (and this may be because I don't speak Italian so I might be missing something in translation). On the other hand it has an art film, almost a travelogue feel about it and the plot takes a back seat to the lush scenery. Not being a Bava aficionado, I'm not sure how this stacks up against his other films. It certainly wasn't (to his credit) as gory or graphic as I expected.

Overall, this was an interesting movie. If you're a Bava or Christie fan I'd suggest watching it but knowing it is an acquired taste. I think you only ""get it"" after two or more viewings.",1278979200,,1870,4.35243553008596
7937100,3,B00005B6KI,"While this film has it's moments, and probably should be viewed by all Bava enthusiasts, I wouldn't recommend this as your Bava intro if you're a newcomer.  It's got alot of the Bava trademarks and such, but most reviewers are correct when they say this is one of Bava's lesser films.  Of course a lesser Bava film is infinitely better than a ""good"" Michael bay film anyday.  This movie plays out like Bava's version of Clue.  It's a bunch of folks holed up in a snazzy house on an island.  One of these guests has developed a very important formula for industrial purposes(it's never clearly explained just what it is).  A trio of high falootin rich guys are persistent in trying to get the inventor to sell it to them.  He don't wanna sell!  He wants to do it for the benefit of humanity and not personal profit.  How noble.  Soon, the guests start dropping off like flies and the question is, who's doing it?  Is it because of this formula?  Marital infidelity?  Detroit?  Is the professor as noble as he seems?  Ya know, honestly you really don't care all that much.  While the movie's never exactly boring, it's never that interesting either.  Only a handful of characters stand out, and unless you've seen it many times, alot of the female characters seem interchangeable, and it's sometimes difficult to determine who was who and what their part in the whole thing was.  On the positive side, it's got some groovy music, some succulent women and of course, those Bava visuals.  Hardcore bava fans-see it for sure, everyone else-optional.",1183939200,,1544,4.6940298507462686
7937101,2,B00005B6KI,"This early giallo from Italian master Mario Bava concerns a party of rich sophisticates who are gathered on holiday at a luxury island home. One of them is a scientist who has invented some highly useful scientific thing that could earn him a fortune. It turns out that the other men in the group want to offer this character large sums of money to cut them in on the discovery, but the scientist refuses, and soon afterwards the guests start turning up as corpses. With large money sums at stake and nobody trusting anyone, the holiday becomes a cat and mouse game as all the guests try and stay one step ahead of the murderer among them.

What we have here is really quite a mundane thriller in which we watch 8 or so unlikeable people argue and fight with each other, while trying to avoid becoming the next corpse, in the style of the old ""Ten Little Indians"" chestnut. As is the norm for an Italian thriller from this era (1970), the women are all impossibly gorgeous and the men are all kind of ugly and brutish, plus there's also a lot of great 1970's detail (I loved the revolving bed which really enlivened a couple of scenes!). Much screen time is allotted to filming the female cast members in various glamorous outfits and locations, and it has to be said that this pays off with some very lovely women filling the screen, including cult favourite Edwige Fenech. However, apart from the beautiful actresses and a certain amount of expectation youi may have for finding out who the killer is, there isn't really a lot else worth watching this for. The pace of the film seems devoid of any tension or excitment. The plot twists are more confusing than entertaining (you'll know what I mean when you reach the part where all the cast pass out on the sofa, then disappear, and then reappear again!), and you won't find any of the characters likeable or interesting enough to care whether they make it to the end alive or dead.

As a giallo or thriller, the film fails to engage. The murders are all off screen and only a freezer full of corpses provides any sense of chills. As a Bava film, it has to be considered a poor effort, but due to his considerable talents, this still means it's a better film than a lot of others out there. Still, after my introduction to Bava was via such masterpieces as ""Blood and Black Lace"",  ""Lisa and the Devil"" and ""A Bay of Blood"", I was expecting something a bit more interesting than this. I would only recommend this if you have to see everything that this director has produced. Otherwise, stick with his other, more successful releases",1168905600,2,2585,4.519230769230769

High-powered businessmen, beautiful women wearing 60s fashions, and 60s lounge music on the soundtrack all add up to an enjoyable black comedy in the Bava style. Just when you think you have it all figured out, something unexpected happens. Highly recommended - one of my favorite Bavas.",1162944000,,412,5.257575757575758
