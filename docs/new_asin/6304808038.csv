An amazing garden full of statues is were the  movie begin. Inside the cottage there is a world of fantasy with puppets moving everywhere, that seem watch impassive the duel between the two only  characters of the film. I do not miss any other actor in the movie, they  both are enough. Only great actors as them can get it. John Addison's score is as elegant and playful as the film requires.",950918400,3,568,4.549019607843137

926574,1,6304808038,"We so looked forward to this highly rated original version, but quit midway through.  The incessant chatter between two men is over-the-top improbable.  Straight men never talk like this.  Olivier is good, but Caine for me is just an annoyance in this (the accent, the babbling in the dialogue - everything).  Your mileage may vary.  I do think Caine in the Olivier role in the remake with Jude Law is better, but I also don't like Jude Law.  LOL",1506816000,,446,4.582278481012659

926576,4,6304808038,"This is a good movie, fun mystery, well acted. One needs to keep in mind the time at which this film was made - 1972. Social upheavals were rocking the West and this film reflects those upheavals. Laurence Olivier plays Andrew Wyke a species of man - an English country squire - that was in the crosshairs of angry socialists in the early 1970's, so in this film he is a target.  Michael Caine plays Milo Tindle, a hairdresser embracing the casual social norms of his young, new, generation, and he pays a price for his nonchalance. In short you can't just watch the film for the mystery aspects; to understand it you have to have some understanding of what was going on in Western Civilization in 1972 - free love, long hair, bell bottoms, getting high, etc.",1503360000,,759,4.5

The house where this is filmed, along with all the quirky stuff in it, is pretty darn cool. That story is not bad either, though it has been told countless times.

People go on and on about sir Laurence Olivier's acting chops. I don't think they translate well to modern cinema.. and this movie being modern in the context of Olivier's place in cinematic history. Michael Caine is a vastly superior big screen actor.",1497744000,,493,4.406593406593407

926839,5,6304808038,"An amazing movie that I remember from way back when. This movie is over two hours long and riveting all the way, except for the end, which was a letdown for me.

Michael Caine and Olivier are well suited for this movie. I am not a fan of Olivier but he plays the type of bigoted Brit that likes to humiliate people. Caine plays the lower class type well.

Spoiler alert for the following: I thought the automatons were overdone. I realize that the Olivier character is uncomfortable with real people and might prefer machines he can turn on and off, but there was too much of it for my taste. The laughing, circus-like macabre is overdone. It was great the first time I saw it, in Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, but it has been done to death since then.

Getting Caine to dress up as a clown seemed far-fetched to me. I couldn't see him jumping through all the hoops Olivier demands. I did like Inspector Dopple, or whatever. I did like the revenge a bit. The third part was less convincing, thae part where Olivier's girlfriend Tea (Tey-ah, right) is supposed to be dead.

Like I said, I thought the final scene unsatisfying and lacking credibility. Nevertheless, this is worth the watch to watch the two, and only two, actors work.",1465171200,,1236,4.504464285714286

This version has an additional 40 minutes (!) that weren't in the original DVD.  Those 40 minutes include a nice built-in intermission (showing stage mock-ups with background music of Cole Porter tunes) to help re-create the original theatrical experience.

926975,4,6304808038,"A Caine/Olivier tour de force, a duo of impeccable delight - but what is it all about?

Olivier plays a well-to-do middle-aged author living in a mansion to which he invites the younger man, Caine, ostensibly to discuss the latters involvement with Oliviers wife. The mansion is full of tricks, too numerous to mention here, all of which serve to portray Olivier as a gentleman of pranks and high drama.

The thing turns into a battle of wits between two men from different social backgrounds, the wit soon turning to murderous intent.

At 2 hours 18 minutes playing time one could find it a little drawn out in places. Good for a one-off piece of entertainment, but the riddle, once solved, may be all that is needed so that the thing can be put back on the shelf to be re-played to a friend or after a duration in which the memory forgets the detail.

Interesting to note that Caine sat himself down at a Bechstein grand piano.

Something of a smoke and mirrors farce that you may find challenging in its intent right up to the final curtain call.",1456704000,,1049,4.5

927051,2,6304808038,"Which is how I felt about several other movies I reviewed, because I felt they were the types that required seeing them on stage with live actors for them to work. On the stage, you see the whole setting and all the characters in a scene simultaneously, and you can see actions and hear intonations that cannot be transmitted on any recording. On video, there are various cuts and scene changes, you see one person talking while not the other's simultaneous reaction to the dialog, etc.

So how is the movie itself? The story is about an elder, wealthy, eccentric British man who is the author of a very successful detective character series and a mansion full of antiques and toys, and he invites a man of Italian descent who has risen from poverty to become a moderately successful hairdresser. But this isn't a social visit; the hairdresser is the author's wife's lover, and the author says at the beginning that he knows about it. Not that the author could be morally outraged; he himself has a Finnish porn star lover of his own. So what is the author's intention? The hairdresser is supposed to fake a robbery of breaking into the mansion and stealing jewels from a safe, the idea being that the hairdresser could fence the jewels for money, while the author collects the insurance. The hairdresser follows the other's instructions, but is clearly annoyed by the author's way of doing things, such as being forced to wear a clown suit.

In the process, though, the author suddenly pulls a pistol on the hairdresser to reveal his true plan-to kill the hairdresser because he caught him breaking into and robbing his mansion. Not merely for the affair, but for the fact that the author despises a jumped-up poor person of Italian extraction. The hairdresser weeps with terror, and we hear the gunshot.

Several days later, a policeman arrives about the disappearance of the hairdresser. He points to several bits of evidence that suggest that the author had killed him and tried to hide the body. The author gets unnerved, and finally the policeman takes off a rubber mask-he was the hairdresser is disguise. The author is initially amused, but the hairdresser wasn't-he endured the trauma of thinking he would actually be killed (the author used a blank, the hairdresser had fainted, and after awakening had wandered away). The hairdresser then humiliates the author by mocking his fictional detective, and saying that his Finnish lover told him that the author was sexually impotent. He then makes the author look for clues that could incriminate him again before the real police arrive-except they don't. The hairdresser has truly provoked the author-what will be the reaction?

The big problem with the whole story is that everything is pretty predictable. We knew the ""policeman"" was really the hairdresser a mile away, for example. Also, the ending was unconvincing. Surely the hairdresser wasn't going to destroy himself just to get back at the author?",1421452800,2,2963,4.908183632734531

The late Laurence Olivier is justly considered the finest actor of the 20th century, and Michael Caine still easily dominates any screen he steps into. The match between them is classic, perfect, never to be imitated. Olivier sculpts each line with elegance, panache, and cunning. Caine's character on some occasions tries to mimic or conversely ridicule the Lord of the Manor, but in the middle of the film becomes trapped like a child in the illusion. He sinks to the depths of terror, humiliation, and despair. When he returns, he knows his enemy and takes control of the situation with ruthless wit and brilliance. The range involved in all these transformations is huge. Caine manages it perfectly.

Anthony Shaffer adapts his original hit Broadway play into a screenplay that is so twisty even pretzels want no part of it. Here's an interesting tidbit: Albert Finney was originally tapped to play the Michael Caine role but he was either unable to commit or was later viewed as unsuitable for the part (whispers abound that he was too overweight). Obviously, the narrative would've rolled out an entirely different sub-text, absent Caine's marvelously distinctive Cockney stylings.

The plot's basic bones: Snobbish mystery writer Andrew Wyke (Olivier) invites his wife's hairdresser and lover Milo Tindle (Caine) to his sprawling country estate and stages an elaborate ruse. Andrew Wyke, it's quickly revealed, revels in playing mean-spirited pranks and games. And there's something about being cuckolded that makes one step his game up to savage heights. Poor Milo Tindle, victim of a cruel joke. What's a street-savvy hairdresser to do?

In a neat bit of sleight-of-hand, the film's opening credits, with its irrelevant roll call of actors, disguise the fact that this movie is essentially a two-man show, broken up only by the presence of veteran actor Alec Cawthorne who has a nice extended bit as ""Inspector Doppler,"" a pleasant old policeman. A wry smile may have crossed director Joseph Mankiewicz's face when actress Eve Channing's name surfaces on the credits. She plays the role of ""Marguerite Wyke,"" the mystery writer's unfaithful wife. Coincidentally, ""Eve Channing"" is an amalgamation of the names of two characters in one of his earlier films, ALL ABOUT EVE. SLEUTH is peppered with neat inside jokes like that.

It's such a compelling character study. Both Olivier and Caine are superb in their tricky, very demanding roles, so good that they were both nominated for an Academy Award (only to lose out to Brando who failed to suck in THE GODFATHER). The film was also nominated for Best Director, Best Music, and Original Dramatic Score. How often is it that the entire cast gets nominated for an award? It's mesmerizing, watching Olivier and Caine engage in sadistic gamesmanship, and at first I wasn't sure who to root for. But you sense something in the wind when the crafty writer convinces the hairdresser to stage a robbery of the writer's family jewels. One could then collect on the insurance money; the other would have the massive funds required to provide for an expensive woman.

I have to mention the stately Tudor country manor. It is the film's centerpiece as the story confines itself to within that space. Olivier's expansive parlor generates a creepy personality of its own. It is a dizzying sight, that room, opulent yet crammed with all sorts of weird toys and knick-knacks. The room goes a ways in establishing a disquieting atmosphere.

But the central fascination lies with the sublime performances of the two leads. Olivier presents the demeanor of a British lord of the old guard, brimming with haughtiness and entitlement and exuding just a touch of menace and a slight dose of dementia. Michael Caine turns out to be Olivier's perfect foil, but we don't conclude that until very deep into the film. In 1972, Caine was very much the upstart newcomer. Rumor has it that he was very nervous at sharing the camera with the great Olivier, although Olivier, gentleman that he was, very quickly put him at his ease. Caine plays up to his strengths; he plays up his working man sensibilities, and while he initially seems to float in the Great Man's shadow, by the end of the film, he's very much Olivier's ferocious equal. I could watch and listen all day as Olivier playfully messed around with different accents and cadences. Caine's ability to elicit empathy is never more evinced that in the sequence in which he's dressed in a clumsy clown outfit, dutifully carrying out the break-in and theft, even as Olivier scornfully egged him on. You feel quite sorry for Caine's character. SLEUTH grabs you with its its wicked sense of irony and its wonderful theatricality and flair for dialogue. When Olivier, voice dripping with contempt, taunts Caine, ""You're just a jumped-up pantry boy who doesn't know his place,"" well, I grinned with delight (even as I felt bad for Caine). I appreciate words, and a series of them strung together with such elegance and bite can't fail to make me smile. SLEUTH is full of such clever, telling words.",1369094400,2,4594,4.9765625
927242,5,6304808038,"The original 1972 movie of ""Sleuth"", with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, was a wonder on many levels:  great acting, good setting, amazing plot switches, sudden transitions between humor and suspense, great play back and forth across the line of belief, reality, and surprise.  I've been hoping for years that it would come out on DVD; our VHS tape deteriorated over time, loss of color and focus. I have not purchased this VHS version now available from Amazon because of concern that it may be similarly deteriorated.  I'd rather have it on DVD (but over $100?  too much!); may yet buy this VHS to give it a try.

I just watched the 2008 re-make, with Caine in the Olivier role and Jude Law in the Caine role; perhaps it would work better if I'd never seen the earlier version, but I'd say it just didn't measure up.  Something, hard to define, too deeply cold and cynical behind the characters (and the setting matched that, though at first it seemed an ingenious update of the quirky playful mechanisms of the original).  Perhaps it comes down to this:  in the 1972 version, Caine as the younger character was likeable in spite of all his faults; Olivier less so.  In this version Caine in the other role was still likeable in spite of all his faults; and Law less so --- and in that case the ending couldn't achieve the same sad justice and tragedy.",1363737600,,1359,4.582644628099174
927243,3,6304808038,"""Sleuth"" (1972) starring Lord Laurence Olivier (1907 - 1989) and Sir Michael Caine (1933 - ), directed by Joseph Mankiewicz (1909 - 1993) is a 2 man ""tour de force"" stage play presented on film, shot mostly at a famous English restored 15th century manor house mansion called ""Athelhampton Hall,"" owned in 1972 by Joseph Cooke, then a member of the UK Parliament.

Here are details about Athelhampton Hall in England (comments about the ""Sleuth"" movie follow).............

---------------------

The hall is a Grade I listed 15th-century privately owned country house on 160 acres (65 ha) of parkland. It is now open for public visits.

An internet ""virtual tour"" is possible by visiting WWW.Athelhampton. Co. Uk/

Sir William Martyn had the current Great Hall built in about 1493. A West Wing and Gatehouse were added in 1550, but in 1862 the Gatehouse was demolished.

Sir Robert Long bought Athelhampton House in 1665 from Sir Ralph Bankes. In 1684 an attempt was made by the court to sequester the estate from the then owner, James Long Esquire (son of Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet), to recover a debt, but this seems to have been unsuccessful. The estate passed down through the Long family to William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley (Viscount Wellesley, later 5th Earl of Mornington), who sold it in 1848 to George Wood.

In 1891, the house was acquired by the antiquarian Alfred de Lafontaine, who carried out restoration to the interior and added the North Wing in 1920-21.

At the same time de Lafontaine engaged Inigo Thomas to create one of England's great gardens as a series of ""outdoor rooms"" inspired by the Renaissance. 20 acres (8.1 ha) of formal gardens are encircled by the River Piddle, and consist of eight walled gardens with numerous fountains and pavilions, plus a balustraded terrace, statues, obelisks and vistas through gate piers. Great Court contains 12 giant yew pyramids set around the pool by the great terrace.

The lawn to the west has an early 16th-century circular dovecote, and the south terrace features a vast Magnolia grandiflora and a Banksian rose. Pear trees cover the old walls and support roses and Clematis.

Athelhampton has been owned by three generations of the Cooke family, the present owners.  It was the setting for the 1972 film ""Sleuth"".

---------------------------

The movie lasts almost 2 1/2 hours and is hard to watch and get enthusiastic about in spite of the very good actor work of the two movie stars who are the only actors seen in the movie.

The lovely ""Athelhampton Hall"" setting is sort of the ""third actor"" in the show, and is one of the reasons the movie's pacing is slowed down (a small part of the movie was shot in London movie studios, but I would guess less than 10% was).

Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine are always worth seeing....they are two of England's best movie actors, and the problem parts of the movie are greatly forgiveable simply because of the good work the two stars provide.

That said, there are indeed many ""problem parts"" of ""Sleuth"" (1972), and the characters presented by the writer are not interesting or sufficiently endearing to justify the long time the viewer is asked to spend with them.

It is important to like the stars of any movie, and that includes villains, and people who engage in villainy.

Neither of the 2 main (only) characters in ""Sleuth"" (1972) is sufficiently likeable to keep viewers interested, regardless of the superb job Olivier and Caine do with what they are given.

Laurence Olivier probably owned a large percentage of the movie....Michael Caine was just beginning to act in movies he also owned (""Get Carter"" [1971] was the first movie Caine produced and owned, partly).

""Sleuth"" (1972) shows off Olivier's actor talent, which Olivier was no doubt happy with....and since he was the boss of the production, questions about the movie being a big ""ego trip"" for Olivier were probably not raised, neither, likely, were objections to the movie's shortcomings....too long, too slow, too obvious, not well written in many ways.

What the viewer and movie historian are left with is the fact that ""Sleuth"" (1972) is a very important and famous movie starring two of the most important movie actors of the 20th century, and at the same time, it is a mediocre movie in many ways.

It is technically and historically interesting, and not more.

For people (I am one) interested in ""stage plays made into movies which remain interesting historical examples of well done stage plays,"" this movie is worth knowing about and seeing at least once.

BTW, stage plays like ""Sleuth"" (1972)....a play made into a movie..is arguably an art form which many people agree probably died around 1980....see the excellent documentary titled ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" [2004] which presents this view.

Any movie which stars Laurence Olivier is important (also true of any movie starring Michael Caine), and therefore, ""Sleuth"" (1972) is important......but this doesn't mean it's a good movie.

""Sleuth"" (1972) is a bad movie with good qualities and excellent actors.....not the same thing as a good movie, sadly.

927377,5,6304808038,"To see two great actors face off in a film like this is a joy to behold. 'Sleuth' provides this golden opportunity, especially when both actors are at the top of their game. You would think that Lawrence Olivier's grand theatrical acting style and Michael Caine's more straightforward acting style would clash, but in 'Sleuth' they blend wonderfully. It helps that Anthony Shaffer's outstanding screenplay (based on his popular stage play) gives these two actors a delicious cat and mouse game to engage in.
  Olivier is a famous mystery novelist who invites Caine, his wife's hairdresser, to his estate to offer him an intriguing proposal. You see, Caine is sleeping with Olivier's wife and Olivier wants Caine to, as he says, ""take her off my hands"". To reveal anymore would spoil all the fun. Just enjoy the twists and turns of this delightful story.
  Translating a stage play like this to the big screen can be a tricky proposition, but director Joseph L. Mankiewicz pulls this off splendidly. Ken Adam (who worked on many of the James Bond films) does a brilliant job designing the sets, especially the incredible variety of games that are featured which vividly illustrates the obsession with games playing that Olivier's character has. I don't know if Ken Adam found them in shops or invented them himself, but they certainly are ingenious. You try solving a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle that's completely blank!

927379,5,6304808038,"Saw this film so many years ago and was entranced by it then coming as it does from a remarkably well crafted stage play,by one of our best playwrights,Anthony Shaffer. What really draws you in is the battle of wits between the older,more erudite,class conscious gentleman Andrew Wyke(Olivier),whose games-playing hides his snobbery against those like Milo Tyndale(Michael Caine),from poorer back grounds,who betray their non-Englishness,and lack of ability to match Wyke in gamesmanship. Tyndale is perceived as a social-climbing, wop hairdresser,who steals other men's wives. Olivier plays a famous author of detective stories who plans to out wit his wife's lover by inviting him to his country house where he emulates his own fictional hero. He appeals to his vanity by roping him into a plausible scheme of a robbery from his house safe to enrich them both. He really wants to humiliate him.

What really had me watching was the contrast in acting styles between Olivier and Caine. Olivier coming from a great tradition of stage acting, playing Henry V,Othello,Richard III,Hamlet and Lear,transferring them to film and then going on to do parts in cinema like Heathcliffe,act in Marathon Man as a Nazi or a detective in Bunny Lake is Missing. Caine,the young new talent in British cinema with Zulu,Alfie,Harry Palmer ,The Italian Job and Get Carter. His acting was hard-boiled,down-to-earth,suave,well tailored to an inarticulate,yet good-looking modernity. Caine's acting was basically playing himself,a form of non-acting. A contrast then between the verbose,athletic and animated Olivier,with all his capacity for nuance,subtlety,emotion,and Caine's taciturnity,playing shallow, aggressive,hedonists. Caine was put on his guard straight away,pitting his acting chops against the man most ennobled in his professionalism. The film lives up to this with Olivier playing with all the animus and bile of Richard III,condescending to Caine's apprentice learner,whose previous greatest lines-""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!""-do not prepare for him turning the tables on the Master,especially his Inspector Doppler.

I loved the energetic use of the stage set,the moving puppets, the swirling toys,the laughing man who seems to make his victim laugh on the wrong side of their face. That these two hold one's attention for the best part of 2.5 hours is remarkable. The directing extraordinary by Mankeiwitz and the screenplay by Shaffer. These two actors were made to play opposite each other in a way never done before and never seen since. Brilliant fun in a stage house full of props,costumes,eccentric toys and stuffed animals,not forgetting the maze.

Be sure you are clear on the fact the front and back of the DVD box is all in Russian text (only the square insert shown above here is partially in English in the middle of the front), the DVD menu is all in Russian. You will need to select the third Russian word down to get into audio. Next select the word that starts with an A. Then the word below the default P word unless you want Russian subtitles. If you don't speak Russian it is very difficult to negotiate the menu to select Audio English. I was overly anxoius to get this out of print US Region 1 movie so I bought this PAL version.

If you don't mind negotiating a Russian menu, it is a fair price compared to what the greedy people are charging for the English Region 1 version. I suggest unless you are a huge fan of the movie like me you may want to wait for a reprint in English. The movie itself is a delicious game of cat and mouse. When an author played by Sir Laurence Olivier finds out a man of no means, played by Michael Caine, wants to marry his wife he sets out to do the perfect murder. These two great actors do an excellent job of trying to outwit and kill each other. Based on a hugely successful play, the whole movie mostly takes part in the confines of the authors house.

927479,5,6304808038,"One of the most imaginatively scripted films ever made, Sleuth pits the wickedly clever Laurence Olivier against the seemingly vengeful Michael Caine in a game of murder, mystery, intrigue, deception and good old-fashioned sleuthing. Outstanding acting from its two main players, each earning an Academy Award nomination for their efforts, the film is careful to build an intricate story that unfolds in a uniquely unpredictable manner.

Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) is invited to Andrew Wyke's (Laurence Olivier) secluded mansion to discuss Milo's desire to marry Andrew's wife Marguerite. Andrew is a detective fiction novelist who prides himself on solving dastardly crimes with his main character Sinjon Lord Merrydew, while Tindle owns a local salon. Well aware of his wife's frivolous activities and her infatuation with riches and exquisite possessions, Andrew offers Milo an opportunity to burglarize some expensive jewels (170,000 pounds worth) so that Milo can live happily with Marguerite, and Andrew can collect the insurance money and live happily with his mistress Teia. But not everything is as it seems, especially when the game-obsessed Andrew convinces Milo to use a clown costume and dynamite to stage the robbery; and add to that a tumultuous recreation of a downstairs fight with a fireplace poker and a pistol. A riveting contest of deadly one-upmanship ensues with unforgettable twists and an unparalleled conclusion.

Expertly directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and based on the play by Anthony Schaffer, the film opens with delightfully circus-tinged music that lends itself throughout the entire film to mix up the tone as each of the characters transition from serious to comical. Tindle starts with a serious demeanor and is instantly weary of Andrew's proposition, but with his whimsical and carefree manner, Milo soon dons a surprising mask of laughable lightheartedness, joining in with dancing about and playful mockery. The interactions between the two constantly change from the serious tone of adultery to the nonchalant air of jocose buddies.

The film is essentially only two people in a single location, and yet it never slows and never misses a beat, staying relentlessly engrossing. The mansion is filled with toys, odd dcor and games - games being the focal point of the film. The design of the rooms is fantastic, with creepy dolls, mystifying puzzles, and electronic puppets, including Jolly Jack Tar the sailor, a particularly eerie life-size monstrosity that laughs and claps his hands at the touch of a button. These complex games emphasize the seriousness of the game played by Andrew, one easily crossing the line of a harmless practical joke. But even when the initial game concludes, another is started and the film is careful to never let you know when a game is over and who is about to win. Initially, more than winning and losing, it is the excitement of playing the game that thrills Andrew, and the audience is spellbound watching it unfold.

With flawless performances by both Caine and Olivier and unbelievably intelligently scripted Shakespearean dialogue, Sleuth redefines audience immersion into a film in which the plot keeps thickening. Perhaps the most astoundingly coincidental moment of the film is early on when Olivier mentions that in years to come their roles might be reversed, and Milo will be the one fending off admirers of his trophy wife. 2007 marks the release of the remake of this 1972 classic, and Michael Caine ironically returns to play the role Olivier unquestionably perfected.

Anthony Shaffer is a guy who knows how to think things through. He creates labyrinthine plots, and then throws interesting characters into them. While I'd argue with anyone who contests that the finest adaptation of a Shaffer work to the screen is Robin Hardy's immortal The Wicker Man, Sleuth is certainly not far behind.

Andrew Wyke (Sir Laurence Olivier) is a man who is, perhaps, overly fond of games. He invites Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) to his estate one evening for a bit of game-playing. You see, Wyke is fully aware that Tindle is the lover of his wife Marguerite (Eve Channing, who bears a striking resemblance to Joanne Woodward). He sets forth a rather interesting proposition: he wants Marguerite off his hands, and Milo's in need of a bit of cash, so why not have Milo rob the house? After all, Wyke can claim the theft on insurance. It's a win-win situation. Milo, however, becomes increasingly aware as time goes on that not all is what it seems...

The movie was nominated for four Oscars (Best Actor for both Caine and Olivier, Best Score, and Best Director) and four BAFTAs (Best Actor for Olivier, Screenplay, Art Direction, and Cinematography for Oswal Morris, who'd won the Oscar the year previous for A Fiddler on the Roof). It managed to get through both awards presentations with a complete snubbing, but that's in no small part because it ran into a roomful of chainsaws that year (The Godfather, Truffaut's Day for Night, La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie, and Cabaret, all entries on many, many 100-best lists over the years, were some of the films that snatched awards away from Sleuth). That it managed to snatch such defeat from the jaws of victory is more than anything a measure of how strong the film community was at the time; when was the last time you saw Oscars and BAFTAs with that kind of a roster competing for awards? Sleuth may have managed to finish second, but Sham finished second to Secretariat, too. Sham still ran the second-fastest Kentucky Derby ever recorded.

Sleuth is a wonderful movie.

Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) has arrived at the estate of Mr. Andrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier).  Not only did he have a difficult time trying to find the mansion, even with a map, now he has to find Mr. Wyke through a massive maze of well-cropped bushes.
  Mr. Wyke is enlisting the service of Mr. Milo Tindle to commit a murder.  A little mayhem for entertainment, Mr. Wyke has a lot of mechanical dummies and things around the house.
  The victim is going to be, as Mr. Wyke explains, his wife Marguerite who Mr. Tindle has been having a close association with.

Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier and Director Joseph Mankiewicz were nominated for an Academy Award.

I have seen this film several times, and although knowing the twist, it is the great performances of Caine and Olivier that makes this movie worth watching.  The script is as good as a script can get, with Olivier lapping up every delicious line with gusto, and a young Caine having no problem standing on his own brilliant performance next to the master.

This is no 'ceuf pourri' by any means.  And although not a new movie, one must return to 'the place they are familiar with' and ..... relish the enjoyment of this film.

Although 'Milo' (Caine's character) is in a 'sticky' situation, the back and fourth of betrayl from beginning to end is worth keeping within a 'photo album' of deciet.  Seek the truth, and while doing so, lap up this brilliant film.",1159142400,,855,4.704697986577181

927578,5,6304808038,"Well, wouldn't you know it? I finally get around to changing over to DVD from my VHS library, and sure enough I find one classic film after another short-shrifted in one way or another by the suits.

Where to begin.

This film is so good in all possible ways it hardly admits expression. Michael Caine, who does have a modicum of talent, but nothing more, actually doesn't come off too bad alongside the master, none other than Laurence Olivier himself, and pretty much at his best at that given the screenplay par excellence by Anthony Shaffer wedded to the inspired direction of Joseph Manckiewicz, working on what turned out to be his last film. I wouldn't know how to fault this collective effort. Even the musical score by John Addison is topnotch. All in all, the film never misses a beat--not one single beat.

Of course, it won't be for everyone. For instance, the viewer is expected to pay close attention throughout. This is not a film for potty breaks and popcorn runs. Also, there are no car crashes with accompanying LFE and all that, or new-age music to hum along to. And the more educated the viewer then the more the movie's riveting humor and dialog must tellingly strike home.

I don't know what else to say. Without a doubt it's Caine's best performance (in my judgment his next best would be his screen debut in Zulu), and for my money Olivier, who had more talent in his little finger than most so-called movie stars even dream of, never seemed more at ease with a role.

As for the plot: this movie is all about its plot, which is so tightly and expertly interwoven that to mention much at all would be to give something important away, and what would be the fun in that? So I think it's best for anyone who has not yet seen this picture to snare a copy somehow (it appears to be long out of print--maybe one day someone in corporate will throw us a bone and restore and present this film properly--yeah, I know, I'm dreaming), take the phone off the hook, and sit down for a scintillating session of rare and accomplished entertainment.",1134432000,3,2059,4.524193548387097

Having bought the DVD recently, the black copy, I can see why I, as a 12 year old, had trouble sitting through the entire movie.  It's over 2 hours of suspense, intrigue, double crosses, witty and funny dialogue, and really challenges the viewer to pay attention and follow it very closely.  Now I watch it every few weeks, always finding something new, and always finding something else to analyze or laugh about.  Moreover, there are a lot of one liners that are as funny (and witty) now as they were then.  Everyone should own this movie, for if no other reason then to have proof that great filmmaking doesn't need a lot of violence and nudity to keep you glued to the screen.",1111881600,3,856,4.455128205128205
927581,5,6304808038,"The title of this movie has always seemed to compleatly fail to capture the spirit of this film. I've always thought the movie should be called 'Only A Game'. Sleuth sounds like some standard detectives fair and this is not standard. The movie is a game and it is about games and Anthony Shaffer is playing a game with the audiance.

It is hard to describe the film without giving away a twist or turn but the begining is fairly safe. Milo Tindel (Michael Caine) is invited to the country manner of Alaxander Wake (Laurance Olivier). Wake is a rather bizarre eccentric obsessed with games, the gentry, and his own unaturaly large ego. Tindel is almost his poler opposite. Tindel came from a poor background and was the son of an impoverished Itlalian watch maker. Wake who seems to have had the world handed to him on a aristocratic plate were as Tindel is a struggling self made bussness man.

Wake announces to Tindel three things: he knows Tindel is having an affair with his wife, he doesn't care, and he's willing to help Tindel commit insurance fraud if he'll just take Margarite off his hand. The film then decends into a series of twits and turns which I will not metion.

The back bone of this film is the actors. Both Caine and Olivier were nomanated for the oscar that year and they both deserved the nomination. They make all the fantastical games playing seem real and add energy to the story (which play adaptations usualy are lacking). Their perfect for their roles in this intricate game of class war fare.

This is one of the best",1110240000,2,1547,4.553956834532374
927582,5,6304808038,"Sleuth is a difficult film to review without hindering the pleasure it offers the newcomer, since watching the film's twists and reversals reveal themselves is a big part of the fun.  Lawrence Olivier is mystery author Andrew Wyke, a cuckold who invites his wife's lover, Michael Caine's Milo Tindle, to hear a proposal.  Wyke keeps up appearances as a blase Englishman who's just relieved to be rid of his profligate wife, and wishes to help the more earthy Tindle to support her financially, though a staged burglary of his insured jewels.  Yet there is more to Wyke's scheme, we soon see, just as there is more to his attitude toward Tindle, the son of an immigrant watchmaker who would dare step out of his place to take the wife of a well-placed Englishman.

Olivier and Caine are both fantastic in this film, and their performances alone make the film come alive.  But the fantastic script is just as compelling.  Sparklingly witty and droll dialogue with a sinister undertone building as the plot twists just keep coming, impeccably paced all contribute to a film that is a thrill to watch the first time, in a state of ignorance, and almost as fun to watch when you know what's coming, admiring just how masterfully it all unfolds.",1099180800,3,1239,4.73953488372093
927583,5,6304808038,"As an earlier reviewers has pointed out, Anchor Bay has released TWO different prints of Sleuth, so you'll want to be careful which release you purchase.  The older release had an unsatisfactory transfer that looked very bad.  That version was a flipper disc and was packaged with a WHITE cover, and Anchor Bay has wisely let it go out of print.  Avoid it!  (Unless you collect OOP DVDs....)

The newer release has a BLACK cover and boasts a much improved transfer.  (Just compare the vibrancy of the colors in the film to the muted colors in the unrestored trailers to see what I mean.)  In addition to putting the whole film on one side of the disc, Anchor Bay also included an extensive and fairly interesting interview with writer Anthony Shaffer.  This version is probably definitive -- and certainly the one to buy.

Apparently, however, Anchor Bay is going to let this release go out of print, too.  (It has disappeared from their online catalogue.)  So buy this quickly if you have any interest in it at all.  I can't imagine any other company giving this film a better overall treatment.",1097193600,11,1096,4.680628272251309
927584,5,6304808038,"The idea of a movie with only two actors in it may not sound overly exciting, but when you watch ""Sleuth"" for the first time, you realize that it couldn't have worked any other way. For many years, ""Sleuth"" has been one of my favorite movies, and remains so to this day. It is cleverly written and superbly acted by both Michael Caine (my all time favorite actor) and Sir Laurence Olivier.
The tag line ""Think of the perfect crime...then go one step further"" describes exactly what the movie is all about. Olivier plays Andrew Wyke, an eccentric and revered mystery writer invites Milo Tindle (Caine) over to his mansion over a weekend in order to discuss the terms of his affair with his wife. Wyke is known as a lover of toys, games, and deviously cunning games of trickery that he plays on people. Wyke has known for some time that Tindle has been having an affair with his wife, and that he intends to marry her. Wyke sees an opportunity to unload his wife, without the possibility of her coming back and getting deeper into his pocketbook. Knowing him to be broke, Wyke proposes to Tindle a robbery scheme that will solve both of their problems. Things got a bit awry. What happens next would be criminal to give away, but it is one of the most brilliantly crafted farces I have ever seen in a movie.
""Sleuth"" was adapted from the stage play by Anthony Shaffer, and it plays out very much like the play itself. There is one setting, two actors, and lots of dialogue. It works very well, because it wasn't overdone in production. I cannot see how this could have worked with a more elaborate setting or cast. What carries the movie are the performances by Caine and Olivier, which ranks among their personal best (and picking ones from such distinguished careers is hard). Their interaction between each other is riveting, since their characters are so cunning. ""Sleuth"" was made in 1971, and 30 years on, every aspect of the movie has aged well. It is one of those movies that makes time stand still, and you are unaware that 2 hours has gone by at the end of it. That is the token of a great movie.
The Anchor Bay DVD boasts the best transfer and sound quality of ""Sleuth"" so far, though the previous versions were also very good (including the VHS, which is rare for older movies). The main supplement is the 20 minute featurette ""A Sleuthian Journey with Anthony Shaffer"", in which the famous playwright is interviewed on his experiences with the play, the making of the movie, and his interactions with the filmmakers. He is jovial and gives plenty of fun anecdotes throughout the interview. Aside from that, there are talent bios and the usual trailers and TV spots. Considering the age and modest budget, not much in the way of extras should be expected.
""Sleuth"" is a rare movie that I can watch over and over again, and I am pleased to see that Anchor Bay did justice to the movie with this excellent (and modestly priced) DVD. An easy purchase for any movie fan.",1074556800,11,2976,4.543761638733706
927585,5,6304808038,"Sleuth is Anthony Schaffer's play of mystery and murder brought to the screen. If you are an Oxford scholar you will have no problem with this film. Others may require a dictionary as this is a very erudite work. You also cannot blink, cough, or let your mind wander for a moment or you will lose your place as to what is happening. I say these things because they are true and because it is one of the most intelligent scripts ever brought to the screen. I can only compare the ""Brideshead Revisited"" script that was done by John Mortimer to match this production from 1972. Michael Caine was at his best, and although Oliver's performance on screen seems top notch, if you have read anything on the making of this film it was reported that he had trouble learning his lines among other distractions. The SETS on this film are memorable! VERY EXPENSIVE and CUSTOM games are everywhere. The music is VERY atmospheric, from the harpsichord improvs to the old Cole Porter tunes. Unusual in that it features only two men without the mandatory love interest that pervades every American picture but their duels do concern a love relationship with women of mutual acquaintance. Oliver is a mystery writer who has a character, St. John Lord Merridew solve all the plots ala' Hercule Poirot. The play and film are tributes to the classic detective fiction of the golden age of the 1930's. ""Where every cabinet minister had a thriller by his beside and all detectives were titled."" He uses his talent in mystery to entice and trap Michael Caine (his wife's current lover) in a series of games of death within the mansion meant to scorn and ridicule by upper class methods and put a trumped up pantry boy in his place!

It's a pleasure to watch these two actors at work (or is it ""play""?).  I've never enjoyed Mr. Caine more.

It's quite unusual to see a movie with the entire cast comprising just two people! (Well, for the most part we see just the two leads at any rate.)  And each of these standout ""leads"" does a bloody good job of holding our interest till the end.

I would certainly recommend this top-notch tongue-in-cheek murder mystery.",1035072000,,621,4.820754716981132
927666,5,6304808038,"Simply put, Sleuth leaves me in awe after every viewing. To watch Olivier and Michael Caine, who reportedly was a little nervous squaring off agaist the master, is like watching an excerise in Acting 101.
The plot is convoluted, in a good way, and uses dialogue to push the story. Very much like a play, the joy in watching the movie is the two actors squaring off, always trying to one up each other, both in character and most likely as themselves. Michael Caine might have been reported being nervous, but it doesn't show. This might be one of his greatest performances, and this was before his indy boom of the late nineties. This was Caine in his prime, and Olivier winding down his career in a performance only Marlon Brando could have beaten, a la ""The Godfather"" released the same year.
Joseph L. Mankiewicz's certainly surprises as a director. The legendary director of ""All About Eve"" shows a bit of flash and art to go with the solid substance of his profession. The segues using the many prop pieces in the main setting is ingenious, and quite honestly, a little unsettling. Watching a horde of puppets seemingly moving on their own, banging and laughing, certainly adds a uniqueness to the picture that stands up with the two major performances.
DVD-wise, it's not Criterion, but the sound is average and the picture is better than it's probably ever been on home video. Not that that has any influence over my decision to purchase this DVD. Nope, this is simply one of my favorite films, a gem that a lot of people don't even know exists.

927670,5,6304808038,"Okay, this is the serious stuff here. Movies like Sleuth are the reason I love movies -- the reason anybody should love movies, now that I think of it. Why, you ask? Well, the reasons are numerous. First off, I'm a sucker for a well-adapted film version of a stage play -- Oleanna springs immediately to mind, as do Look Back In Anger (the Richard Burton version), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (again because of Burton, and what a shame he didn't get the Oscar he so richly deserved), and Branagh's stunning Henry V (the promise of which K. B. has been trying, and mostly failing, to live up to ever since), as well as about a dozen others I haven't the space to mention. Sleuth, adapted by Anthony Shaffer from his own play, stands right up there with those films. It helps that Shaffer has an idea of what a good screenplay should be -- he has a fine visual sense, as witness the first meeting between Olivier and Caine, shifted from the house's interior to the wonderful topiary maze, which sets the mood, provides moments of both humor and suspense, and establishes character, all in a span of a few minutes. Of course, I've no doubt that director Mankiewicz had a hand in this fine sequence as well, but in any event I've rarely seen such a nicely-handled piece of visual foreshadowing in any film.
I will not spoil the plot for you -- that would be unfair, even cruel. It's far better, where this film is concerned, to allow the viewer to watch the events unfold on his/her own, and to be completely dazzled by them. I will say that Sleuth is about games, games of every type and stripe, from the subtlety of chess to the pretend (or is it pretend?) brutality of cops and robbers. There are several games being played in Sleuth, sometimes more than one at the same time, and just when you think you've learned the rules of one, you find that not only have the rules changed, you're not even playing the same game any longer. All this is a roundabout way of saying that Sleuth is as delightful as the best sleight-of-hand magic trick, as intellectually rigorous as Arthur Conan Doyle's most dexterous Sherlock Holmes stories, and more wantonly, gleefully devious with its audience than the great Hitchcock ever dreamed of being (with the exception of Psycho, of course, but that's a review for another time!). Sleuth pulls the wool over your eyes so many times, and in so many ways, that even when you think you know what's going on, you don't. Behind each mask is another mask, behind each truth is the lie from which it grows...and each new surprise is delivered with Macchiavellian subtlety and nitroglycerine force. Ah, but I wax rhapsodic; excuse me. Onward:
As to the performances of the actors -- what can I say except, BRAVO! There is nothing on God's green earth like watching two supremely talented actors ""going at it,"" so to speak -- playing roles to the hilt, with such verve and energy that you lose yourself totally in the delight of it. Such is the joy of watching Michael Caine and Sir Laurence perform in Sleuth. Two moments in particular stand out in my mind, for very different reasons. First is the sequence where the two literally play ""dress-up"", trying on costumes in Olivier's basement, camping it up to beat the band and having a high old time doing it. (I love Caine with the slap shoes: ""I always wanted a pair of these!"") The whole thing is so deliciously silly it puts me in tears of laughter, no matter how many times I see it. The second moment is the scene on the staircase (near the end of what would be Act One in the play), which pulls the rug out from under you, and sets you up for more of the same later on. Caine and Olivier here achieve something so incredible, so intensely-felt and riveting, that words fail me (for once). Caine has gone on record as saying that he was petrified by the idea of having to hold his own with Sir Laurence -- his fear must have served him admirably in this scene.
Two final notes: the most underrated aspect of this film is Mankiewicz's able, artful direction -- simply because it's also so unobtrusive. One might think, given the rich script and fine actors, all he had to do was just point the camera and shoot. Not so. Any director who can do what Mankiewicz did here is not just brilliant but a genius. Second, I would also be remiss if I didn't single out the wonderful performance of Alec Cawthorne, who takes a minor role and makes it the equal of the two leads. And those of you who know Cawthorne's other work will agree with me that this is his finest moment. (You there in the back, stop laughing.) Of course, fans of this movie will get the joke right away -- please don't spoil it for those who haven't! Cawthorne is the best surprise in Sleuth, a movie with no small store of surprises to begin with. It will fool you completely, and you will love every second of it.",985910400,6,4862,4.470191226096738
927671,5,6304808038,"The 1972 release, SLEUTH, is one of those movies that one watches, and then exclaims, ""Wow!""
Michael Caine plays Milo Tindle, a lowborn, cheeky hairdresser called down from London to visit Andrew Wyke on his rambling country estate. Andrew, played by Sir Laurence Olivier, is a class conscious, game-addicted, petty snob who writes award-winning detective stories. Milo also happens to be having an affair with Andrew's wife, Marguerite. On the other hand, Andrew is currently dallying with a local masseuse, Ta. Both men have cash flow problems. Milo hasn't enough to keep Marguerite in the lifestyle to which she's become accustomed, and Andrew has been beggared by ruinous British taxes. So, Andrew, being a self-proclaimed expert on crime whose literary detective creation, Lord Merrydew, always manages to make the official constabulary look like fools, invites Milo to join him in a mutually lucrative scam. The Plan: a suitably costumed Milo will ""burgle"" jewelry from Andrew's safe, fence it for an enormous sum, and be free to marry Marguerite, while Andrew happily collects the insurance money and enjoys his Siren of the moment. Andrew is not completely happy about his wife's adultery, but, after all, true gentleman can come to some convenient arrangement. Quite right!
Thus begins an intricate series of role-within-role-playing games played magnificently by these two phenomenal English actors. From the viewers' perspective, the challenge is to determine when the make-believe ends and real life reasserts itself. Thus, not only is SLEUTH an absorbing mystery story, but the roles within roles also create a resounding paean to the profession of acting. After SLEUTH, I don't think it was quite so cleverly done until 1997's FACE-OFF.
Both Caine and Olivier were nominated for Best Actor Oscars for their performances in this film. Sadly, neither won. In despite of that appalling injustice, this is one of those films that I can watch over and over again, and never fail to be delighted.",979776000,20,2004,5.246105919003115

Mankiewicz, SLEUTH is the perfect movie for you if you like excellent actors, Laurence Olivier and Michal Caine for instance, a subtle plot with unexpected twists and a superior cinematography.
I was amazed by the admirable production design of the movie. Laurence Olivier's mansion is a dream come true, every objects appearing on the screen seem to have a priceless value and the rooms, including the cellar, are little museums. Joseph L. Mankiewicz had to nail the audience in some way because SLEUTH is not a play with a lot of characters and could have discouraged the viewer if the director hadn't been such a talent. Another (innocent) trick of Mankiewicz is to film the puppets or the masks as if they were alive, you always have the feeling that the characters are not alone in the mansion.
One can regret that the Anchor Bay DVD presents only a scene access and no english subtitles. The image quality was, in my opinion, rather good, without black or white spots. Sound, on the contrary, could have been better.

7877405,3,6304808038,"Review of Sleuth
Hot Toasty Rag, December 5, 2017

Its really best if you know absolutely nothing about the plot before watching Sleuth. Its also really best if you watch the original before the remake, if you do decide to torture yourself with the remake. And most of all, its best if you see Anthony Shaffers play onstage before either of the films. My mom saw the play in San Francisco, and Ill never forget her story of how exciting it was. Seeing Sleuth onstage was an experience, she always said. The film just isn't the same.

Both Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine were nominated for Best Actor at the 1973 Oscars, and while both are tour-de-force parts, they were beaten out by Marlon Brando in The Godfather, which was pretty ridiculous. I had a Sleuth marathon and watched both versions on back-to-back evenings, and it wasn't until I watched the 2007 version that I truly appreciated Laurence Oliviers performance. You really don't have to watch the remake, though; you can just appreciate all Larry does the first time around. He truly embodies the role as Anthony Shaffer wrote it. You can actually see the wheels turning in his head as he and others play out his games, and the more the games are played, the more he feels alive and virile. Hes excited, and always in control, and more than perhaps any other of his performances Ive seen, you can imagine that he actually lives in the mental state of his character even when the cameras are turned off. Without revealing any more of the plot, Ill move on to the other main performance.

Michael Caine is the dumb to Larrys smarts, the youth to his age, and the emotion to his cunning. He does a very good job, and I guarantee there will be certain scenes of his that will stick with you decades after you watch them. I happen to like Michael Caine more than Laurence Olivier, but in my reviews I try not to let personal feelings interfere with objective talent. However, Michael Caine is the infinitely more likable character in the story, and if you're as partial to him as I am, youll probably be very rattled by this version. As anxious as youll be to watch the remake and see him in the larger role, once you do, youll realize his place was best in the 1972 version. Hes much more convincing as the low-class Alfie type than as the blue-blood who thinks quicker than he breathes.

Joe Mankiewiczs direction was very odd, splicing in close-ups of objects around the house in the middle of long shots that were meant to immerse audiences in the tense dialogue. It was jarring and added nothing to the story. John Addison obviously got his wires crossed and believed he was scoring music for Murder by Death, Without a Clue, or some other spoof. His music had no place in an intense drama, and if Im being kind, Ill say it was distracting.

Fans of either of the main leads will probably want to rent this classic, and since you didn't grow up hearing my moms story, you won't be nearly as disappointed in it as I was. At the very least youll get to watch some good acting, but be forewarned: I had nightmares after I watched it!

Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence and some frightening images, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1512432000,,3250,4.537542662116041
7877406,4,6304808038,"At last, SLEUTH comes to DVD.  Unfortunately, it's not a new scan of the film.  The format is letterboxed for 4:3 televisions, which means on today's 16:9 displays, there is a black bar on all four sides of the picture (windowboxed).  Many displays will let you expand the image to fill the screen, with an accompanying loss of resolution (sharpness).  There are no extras on the disc, and no subtitles.  It's better than nothing, but barely.",1509753600,,442,4.7631578947368425
