Paiste Cymbals!",1420761600,,92,5.642857142857143
8516674,5,B0050ODYYU,"I'm a huge fan of the Drumbassadors. They are so entertaining that you don't even need to be a drummer to get something out of their performance. If you ARE a drummer, these guys and this DVD offer plenty of material to spin your head and inspire you to raise your level of play. They have very deep technique and combine jazz, African, and funk (mostly) in a way unlike any other percussionist I can name. Treat yourself to this one!",1374537600,2,434,4.37037037037037
