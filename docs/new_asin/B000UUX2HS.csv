8214927,1,B000UUX2HS,"This video had a promising beginning, featuring inventions such as the light bulb and telephone which clearly changed the lives of many.  I had intended to show the video to a class of middle school students, but found that the video began to highlight odd and unusual inventions rather than those that truly had an impact on society.  I stopped watching the video when it showed a musical condom.  The video's contents are inappropriate for school-aged children, and lose their relevance after about half-way through the video.",1254700800,17,528,5.045977011494253
