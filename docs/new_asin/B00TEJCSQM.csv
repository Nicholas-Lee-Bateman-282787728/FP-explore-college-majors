It's like a modern indie film done in a classic Hitchcock style. There's a review online: http://www.gofreakmedia.com/news/2015/01/11/house-behind-wall/

7005779,5,B00TEJCSQM,"I had the opportunity to see the premier of The House Behind the Wall.  Being filmed at historic Ft. Monroe, Va., the setting adds credibility to the ghosts of Ft. Monroe, and this one in particular.  Camera work is outstanding, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat.  One of the better YA films I have seen in a long time.",1423699200,2,331,4.140625

7005789,1,B00TEJCSQM,"I watch a fair amount of independent horror films, and you can definitely make a decent movie that way if your writing is good and you've got at least passable equipment and sound.

Unfortunately, this movie doesn't really have either.  Does it have some good-looking young coeds?  Sure.  But just because that's all you ever see in scary movies doesn't mean that's ALL you need.

To be fair, the actresses did not do a terrible job, they just weren't given much to work with. And to be frank the most egregious sin in this movie was the sound mix.  So bad!  Half the time you can hardly hear the dialogue because the ""scary music"" is so, so loud.  Similarly, there's a lot of slow walking up and down the stairs or hallways in this movie, and the footsteps are incredibly loud.  Ridiculously loud.  I can't believe the filmmaker didn't watch this and cringe (and then immediately fix it).

Unfortunately, it lends the whole film a very amateurish feel.

I think the good reviews are friends, family, and people who live in the area who are excited to see their local legend ""on the big screen"", as it were.",1430265600,3,1107,4.5353535353535355
7005790,4,B00TEJCSQM,"The people who are really criticizing this movie obviously are not part of the target audience. The House Behind the Wall is an independently produced horror film about a real lie apparition done up in the traditional style of ghost telling from the 70s and 80s. The cast members are fantastic, the story is filled with drama and suspense building elements. Is this Paranormal Activity? No. Is this going to scare you senseless? No. But if you like old school ghost stories (let's say Amityville Horror, for reference in story progression not for comparison) then this could be the movie for you. give it a shot.",1429660800,8,612,4.783018867924528
7005791,2,B00TEJCSQM,"I was anxious to watch this movie as it is filmed in Tidewater, Virginia - at Fort Monroe.  I read a lot about it in our local newspaper.
It was neat to have two local young men create a movie !  And exciting.

However, the acting was SO bad I had a hard time finishing it.  The actor's were horrible - and that ruined the plot and story for me completely.",1429488000,,356,3.971830985915493
7005792,1,B00TEJCSQM,"About as witless and not-horrifying as you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other"" but it was just wine. Then I kept saying, ""Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!"" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued ""college students"" I've ever seen in a movie.
Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart.",1429488000,,1791,4.780645161290322
7005793,1,B00TEJCSQM,"Just a bunch of people having inane conversations.  And, since they can't act, it is really really painful to watch.  I am happy to watch low production movies if they are interesting, off kilter,  or amusing (intentionally or otherwise).  This one was simply flat out terrible.",1429401600,2,278,4.978260869565218
7005794,5,B00TEJCSQM,"This isn't a fake review, haters. I don't need to prove to anyone I purchased it to leave a review, I just watched it at my local theater in Hampton, VA. I grew up next to Fort Monroe,  it's a real historical place with real local legends. This movie is a campy horror movie.  Anyone would know that's what they were watching.  For its genre it was fun and not badly done. Beautiful filming of local landmarks. Don't be so closed minded and boring.",1429142400,3,448,4.309523809523809
7005795,4,B00TEJCSQM,"This was a pretty good movie for not having Hollywood backing. It was slightly rough around the edges in some areas but it all it was decent and Def watchable. Brings you back to the college days of renting a huge house, drinking beers and having crazy things going on. The other reviews are probably old bags that couldn't make it through a scary people and didn't have fun when they were younger",1429142400,3,397,4.4520547945205475
7005796,1,B00TEJCSQM,Bad just watched it because I worked on Ft Monroe.  Bad script and horrible acting.,1429142400,4,83,4.533333333333333
7005797,1,B00TEJCSQM,"A good example of a filmmaking team who asked family and friends to post fake reviews. As you can see by all the downvotes of the 5-star reviews, the folks who paid money to watch this thing are pretty pissed off. I was even more angry in that I lived in Hampton Roads, and I've visited the forts, so I wanted very much to like this one. But, nope. I can see that the filmmakers did develop a local following via screenings in the Hampton Roads area (and in local news outlets) and - whether they asked people to or not - there are a ton of fake 5-star reviews.

All the fake 5-star reviews suckered me into it, though, I admit it, as I didn't bother to read the reviews in detail. Hopefully, this will save you the time and money.

Ugh. Another lame c-horror movie. Bad acting, dull plot, really bad CGI (in the few places it was used)... one of those videos you regret taking a chance on.

Plot: Haunted house, ghost of a jilted Civil War husband... No real blood or gore or even nudity (in fact, in the one scene two of the charcters were apparently having sex, I didn't even know it until they mentioned it later in the video - it's that bad). Just another bad microbudget weekend shoot, which was disappointing, as Im a huge fan of indie horror.

I thought the title was a bit intriguing, and the DVD artwork seemed cool... oh well. My bad.",1429142400,4,1345,4.262745098039216

Atmospheric shots of Fort Monroe in Hampton, VA, make it worth seeing for locals, and there's enough story to hold the rest.

As I struggle in the world it irks me to see something so bad that someone who knew someone was probably able to make a fortune with despite their lack of talent , intellect and even effort.

7005815,3,B00TEJCSQM,"It was interesting as far as the quick story is concerned, the make up of the ""zombie"" and it's ""acting"" was a little corny, but I don't mind that .. this had the feel of an old school low budget b movie and that part is great.

What I don't care for is the fact I just spent money for a 16 minute experience..  if they could have panned this out to at least 30 minutes I'd feel more satisfied.. not like $2.00 is that much but that was just to rent it ..

All that aside.. I would totally pay to watch a full length version of it .. corny or not :) the scientist character was fun and there were at least two known actors in it  that I actually like .. so MAKE MORE! :) just not 16 minute snippets at a time ..",1426809600,2,711,3.816326530612245

1) Cinematography was excellent with breath taking B role footage.
2) Sound was clear but choice of music allowed little suspense.
3) Really no suspense or jump scares for a horror movie, it kind of dragged on.
4) Characters were weak, unlikeable and cookie cutter.
5) Acting was above average, best actor was the Sheriff who had a minor role.
6) Screenplay was extremely weak.
7) Not scary at all, found the ""white lady"" or ""lady in white"" laughable.
