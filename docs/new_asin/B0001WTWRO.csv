8157852,5,B0001WTWRO,I stumbled upon this series at the local library and became so involved with the charecters that I wanted more. This is a wonderful series and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries of the British stripe. The contrast between Havers (sharon small) and Lynley (Nathanial Parker) is electric! They play off on another very effectively and the series is entertaining. Stop reading and start viewing!,1244073600,,403,5.029850746268656
