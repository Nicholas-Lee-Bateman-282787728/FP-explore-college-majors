8201287,4,B000RL21RM,"I rather enjoyed this 2  hour retrospective on the decade of Tony Blair as PM. There were many many interviews with co workers, as well as political aids and enemies. I felt the storytelling was even handed and without an agenda which allows the viewer to enjoy the information without being overly manipulated. If  you are also curious the movie ""the Deal"" starring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair I recently viewed and found an almost perfect opening film for this. I'm looking forward to reading  Mr Blairs substantial autobiography after viewing this  program. I purchased it for considerably less than the list price from a marketplace seller and am happy..as I don't believe its worth the high list price...its not something one would revisit often ...if ever.",1284595200,2,762,4.9763779527559056
8201288,3,B000RL21RM,"I'm guessing that many Americans are like me: they don't pay much attention to other nation's leaders.  This documentary was useful in spelling out how Blair rose to power and why he ended his prime ministership.  This may be highly useful for political science majors to see.
Thatcher was very similar politically to Reagan and Blair seems like a British Clinton.  In that way, it's surprising that he got along with Bush, Jr. and actively sought the friendship.  Then again, you could also say it caused his downfall.  I know who Gordon Brown is now, but this work also spells out  why it is not surprising that he is Britain's leader post-Blair.  The work interviews many former politicians and lists their years in office.  This tacitly spells out that no interviewee was in his position for ten years as Blair had been prime minister for so long.
This work glosses over Blair's childhood.  It mentions Oxford, but within a snap, they mention his service in Parliament.  They show a clip of his wife accidentally opening the door in her nightgown that was just hilarious.  One sees his children, but they never give their number, names, or ages.
Blair certainly does not belong in the Simpsons' ""Big Book of British Smiles.""  However, he has a chipped front tooth and few American politicians would allow the public to see their teeth so crooked.  I'm always curious whether famous men have hairy or smooth chests.  It's easy to find that out with actors, but much harder with politicians.  Blair once had the buttons on his golf shirt undone and it reveals that he does have chest hair.  Condie Rice sits for an interview here and her famous teeth gap seems like it's been closed.
It would be easy to feel sorry for Blair, but Churchill and Thatcher too were booted from their gigs.  Perhaps British leaders don't end on a high note as many American presidents do.",1200441600,4,1869,4.719135802469136
