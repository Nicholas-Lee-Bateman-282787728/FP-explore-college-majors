8052010,1,B0007UVWZA,"I just received a copy of this purchased from the Amazon LLC group - it was not an authentic item.  The copy I received was a DVD-R reproduction made with adhesive DVD labels.  By all practicality appears to be a bootleg/amateur copy.  Usually Amazon is good about disclosing if their items are rips and burns but this time it was not disclosed.  I haven't even tried the DVD yet to see if it plays all the way through but wanted to make the public aware - take your time and look around.

- UPDATE -
The DVD plays for 4 minutes and 12 seconds into the program before starting to show glitches, distortion, and obvious production errors in the recording.  At 6:33 in it fails completely and fast forwarding or skipping to the next scene does not do any good. From what I can tell this appears to be a home camcorder recording of public lectures/presentations on behalf of Mr. Mehler.  Changed the rating from 3 to 1 stars.  Unfortunately this is entirely because of the production problems as I cannot even view the program to write a more valuable review on it's content.",1419120000,,1072,4.489690721649485
8052011,1,B0007UVWZA,"How can anyone take this guy repeating hearsay from a local resident seriously? If you go anywhere in the world local tourist guides will con you with false tales about the past so as to enthrall you all the better.

For perspective, this guy also gives astrology readings if you're interested.",1413158400,,294,4.764705882352941
8052012,3,B0007UVWZA,It was ok I guess Stephen look so giddy to be making a presentation it was almost humorous. My question is what is the point to this presentation? That we Misunderstand Egyptian culture? Hell I could of told you that.,1384387200,,217,4.45
8052013,5,B0007UVWZA,"Stephen Mahler is very clear and has had a unique opportunity to study Egyptian spirituality thru an authentic master!
Fascinating material !",1372291200,,141,5.454545454545454
8052014,3,B0007UVWZA,"This is a video made at a lecture in Egypt many years ago. It is not the best quality video. It is a little bit grainy. That being said, it is worth your time, but for no more than $15.00 tops, because of its age and quality. It starts out very slow, but then picks up as the speaker tries hard to cover all of his content in his remaining time. I will probably watch it again, as there is much information covered. If you are looking for a more ""entertaining"" DVD, I would highly recommend ""The Pyramid Code"". Both DVD sets cover the same ideas, but with different information presented. They compliment each other nicely. The Pyramid Code however is a much newer professional production.",1319760000,7,689,4.476190476190476
8052015,5,B0007UVWZA,"Having met Stephen at the Awyan family home on my last trip to Egypt I was interested to hear him speak on this DVD--its a very relaxed but informative experience--I definitely had 2 big AH HA !!!moments-especially concerning Ptah and the colour blue and the use of Harmonics in the pyramids-especially at the Red Pyramid! Some pieces of the puzzle fell into place!---and of course I now cant wait to return to Egypt! Thank you Stephen-until we meet again,love ,light and peace.",1303516800,15,478,4.841463414634147
