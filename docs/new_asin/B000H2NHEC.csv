8136095,3,B000H2NHEC,"Purchased this video because I had seen Bob Hope when I was over seas stationed on the USS John F Kennedy CVA-67. I was kind of disappointed as this video seemed like it was too many, too short clips. Would be better if they could put together videos of each individual stop he made. That sad, Bob Hope and troupe were wonderful, I had seen some of his tours on TV years before I was in service, but never thought I'd see him in person. Even got to shake his hand and say a few words. He's gone but not forgotten. Thanks for the memories.",1325203200,,538,4.133333333333334
8136096,5,B000H2NHEC,"I watched this show as a child and now again as an adult, and it was as excellent then as it is now.  I loved Bob's grace and jibes with the audience.  His bit with my favorite Bond girl of all time, Ursula Andress, was the first place I ever saw the re-inserted foot in mouth punch line.  Also, I didn't know old Bob Hope was so light-footed; his dance bit was quite impressive.  All in all this was a great watch, it was very telling of its time, another instant classic from Bob Hope.",1164931200,,487,4.094736842105263
