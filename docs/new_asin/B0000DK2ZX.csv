8042563,5,B0000DK2ZX,"My kids loved exercising to Kids Exercise with Arfy DVD. They exercise regularly to the DVD. Arfy,a standing upright dog, is entertaining and amusing with his antics. Arfy makes exercise fun! The DVD is educational. The DVD instructs how the exercises use certain muscles for certain sports and activities. I got this DVD to get my kids stronger. The kids do weightlifting exercises, aerobic dance and flexibility exercises.

I can really see the difference in my kids health, I am a nurse.",1180137600,3,490,4.975609756097561
8042564,2,B0000DK2ZX,"We purchased this for use in a first-grade classroom.  After reading the reviews and descriptions we ordered this tape.  On receiving it we found that every participant needs a set of dumbbells and ankle weights.  Nowhere did we see indications that additional additional equipment was needed.  We are now deciding whether to return this tape unopened.  Please be aware that this tape is of dubious benefit unless you have access to dumbbells (the bar-bell type, not the student type) and ankle weights.",1158969600,,503,5.085365853658536
