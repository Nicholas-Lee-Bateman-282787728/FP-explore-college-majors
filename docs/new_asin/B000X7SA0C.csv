The Dick Tracy comic strip was very popular in its era (1930s to 1970s) with both young and old. These serials were shown each week in movie theaters to encourage weekly attendance. Many novels were serialized in magazines to encourage ongoing purchase. Some said the Dick Tracy character was inspired by Eliot Ness, a Prohibition Agent in 1920s Chicago. Chester Gould wrote these for the Chicago Tribune. Later Ness was the Director of Public Safety in Cleveland Ohio during the 1930s. He attacked organized crime and began reforms that were copied elsewhere. These serials were called cliffhangers as their activities enticed the audience to return. How do these stories compare to todays dramas on TV and in the movies?

Note the many things that are no longer around. Steam locomotives, vertical windshields on cars, revolvers (not automatics), an Autogyro, fabric roofed automobiles, dirt roads, cars with running boards, open cockpit biplanes, owner-operated stores, etc. The revolvers seem to have an unlimited amount of ammunition, no reloading required. Do villains still have foreign names?
