8659605,3,B00KKUSFWA,"Antboy is about a young boy who yearns  to be something special and transforms into a mighty superhero. Ordinary, overlooked 12-year-old Pelle (Oscar Dietz) becomes extraordinary after he is bitten by a super-ant and inherits its abilities.

Overnight, the boy no one noticed becomes a local hero and is dubbed Antboy. With the help of new friend and sidekick Wilhelm (Samuel Ting Graf), climbing walls and flipping cars, stopping robbers and saving babies all become part of his new dream life. All this changes, however, when super-villain The Flea kidnaps a young girl, the subject of Pelles affection, and terrorizes the citizens of Middelund. Antboy, Wilhelm, and their friend Ida (Amalie Kruse Jensen) must fight this treacherous evil, rescue the damsel in distress, and save the town.

This Danish film, based on a popular Danish comic book series, owes a lot to the Spider-Man and Batman sagas. The workable gimmick is that Antboy stars middle-school kids. Its a serious film, not a campy spoof, though it has its share of humor. The frequent Pow and Zap that appear in frame suggest the old Batman TV series, but the special effects are far from state-of-the-art, which sort of adds to the charm of the film.

There are no bonus extras on the DVD release.",1407974400,,1264,4.92018779342723
