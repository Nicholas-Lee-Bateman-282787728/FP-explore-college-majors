Now I'm letting everyone know there's a downside to buying this way, I've received more thy I can count of damaged, broken, shattered, shot with bb or pellet guns and the list continues of the shocking things that go on with the product before we receive it, meaning theres no quality control with amazon and you read its new but half of what ive bought or more are damaged in one way or another and my opinion should be read because ive bought hundreds if not into the thousand mark of movies most bluray. Pay more through someone else.",1432080000,,604,4.401785714285714
