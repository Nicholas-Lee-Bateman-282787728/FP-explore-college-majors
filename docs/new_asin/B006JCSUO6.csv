It begins by showing modern data processing equipment being used in Sherlock Holmes office to record his cases. Punched cards are used for input, a typebar printer produces reports. Then it shows people around a campfire, there is a mansion in the background. In the night we hear a womans scream! She comes out of a room and falls. Another woman arrives to help her. Its too late. There is an inquest. How did Violet meet her death? Dr. Watson meets her sister Helen. Dr. Rylott greets Dr. Watson. Part of the mansion is closed off. We see old office equipment used to transmit messages; it has a problem. Watson tells Holmes what happened. (Dr. Rylott beat one of his servants to death in India; a temper or a mental condition?) No motive for murder? Who benefitted? Holmes has a modern recording device to record speech. Will Helen become engaged to marry? Dr. Rylott tells his housekeeper to be patient for a while. Jack will be away on business for a year. Helen is frightened, she doesnt want to wait for a year.

Dr. Rylott explains the economic hardship that would result from Helens marriage. Rylott orders changes to Helens room. Work overtime if needed. Helen recalls Violets dying words: the speckled band. Is this a reference to that gypsy encampment? Helens bedroom will be changed to use Violets room. There are flashbacks. Can Helen go back to that room? Is it nerves? Helen visits Dr. Watson and meets Sherlock Holmes. What has happened to you? Rylotts demeanor changed when Helen told of the engagement. Those gypsies who were there a year ago have returned. Helen heard music at night. Then she heard something in the night and stayed as far from her bed as possible. Rylott barges in and tells Holmes to keep out of his affairs.

Later Watson visits Helens home. Holmes makes a surprise appearance. Rylott has a safe in his room and a dog whip with a loop. Holmes inspects Helens room. A bell rope that doesnt ring, a chair fastened to the floor? There is a hidden opening in the wall. Holmes makes a plan for the night. Rylott returns and questions the butler; Helen sent a message. That night Holmes and Watson return through a window. Rylott takes a snake from his safe and puts it in that opening. Holmes acts, there is a shout from Rylotts room. What is the deadliest snake in India? Later Watson attended a wedding. Holmes dictates into the machine about filing this case.

This is a good story. The version that I viewed had poor audio and may have had some scenes edited out. There was no final scene to tie up any loose ends (the housekeeper, the servant). You should have read the short story first to understand any omitted details. I think this hour-long movie had missing scenes. Murders are caused by love and money, to get it or to keep it said one book.",1402704000,,2819,4.587301587301587
