8135952,4,6302503329,"Pedro (David Silva) and Lupe (Esther Fernandez) tell their story, with flashbacks, through the hardship they had endured all of their lives... Most of that sadness has been caused by ""Zopilote"" (Rodolfo Acosta), who was rejected by Lupe and now is just making their lives miserable.
Unknown to Lupe, Pedro has a little son, but now this is no big deal.
""Zopilote"" moves to the city and Pedro after him, when he finds him, they fight and Pedro loses his memory and goes to jail. Doing time gets better and when he is set free goes back to his hometown, but Lupe is not there anymore, she went to the city looking for him!!
The city is big, and they never meet. Time passes and now the the kid is a teenager, nicknamed ""Chiquilin"" (Raphael Sevilla Jr.), who is selling lotto tickets. He befriends Pedro and Lupe without knowing that he is his father and that she is Pedro's wife. Anyway, meanwhile ""zopilote"" is still at large and one day when they meet again, fight for a lotto ticket that has a prize only to lose it when it blows through the window!

*Let's review the ticket's trip, starting when it blew out of the window, then went down to chiquilin's feet, he picks it up but slips out of his pocket, the janitor throws it in the trash inadvertently but the ticket falls to the ground again, and is only after chiquiln goes to church and prays, that he finds the ticket close to the ball of yarn a woman is using while knitting. Isn't wonderful the power of prayer?

Raphael J. Sevilla (La mujer del puerto) adapted the script and directed. His son, who played chiquiln here, made only three pictures and all three with his father.",1316822400,,1636,4.468227424749164
