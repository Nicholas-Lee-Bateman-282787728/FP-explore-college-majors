7030699,5,B00U7XR5T4,"While I haven't seen the entire film, several websites have featured clips from both the new first-time DVD and Blu-ray release of this classic film (MUCH more than a simple, ""older man"" meets young girl"") creation from director Alberto Lattuada AND I understand that they went back to an original print for the mastering.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that soundtrack master Ennio Morricone handled the music for this film and that his complete music score is included as part of the bonus features!

The Cult Epics studio is known for their attention to detail, so I've got both a DVD and Blu-ray ordered and am looking forward to watching!",1429488000,4,649,4.837837837837838
7030700,3,B00U7XR5T4,"FIRST, my original revue of the movie NOT talking about the Blu-ray.....

I just saw a small snippet of this film on a DVD called ""Celebrity Nude Revue: The Saucy Seventies: Volume Two"". As a kid, I loved Nastassja Kinski almost right away. First I saw ""Tess"", and then she blew me away in ""Cat People"". She is so gorgeous! And in this foreign film, she appears nude in several scenes.

When I wrote down the title of this film, I went to Amazon right away to look for it. But, unfortunately, it is only available as a PAL region DVD. And even that with no English subtitles.

Well, I found this film available somehow on eBay. Someone who has the Italian import of this film and he burns Region-free versions of this film for sale on DVR. I bought this movie from him through eBay. It's not the greatest mastering of the film, plus it has no English subtitles (only Japanese), but I still wanted it anyway.*

I don't understand the story thoroughly because there is so much obvious dialogue in German or Italian. But, to me, it doesn't matter too much. Nastassja Kinski was just about 18 or 19 years old then, and was so frisky and free-spirited in the movie, that I just enjoy seeing her on film.

Who knows? Someday, it might just surprise us that there will be a remastered Blu-Ray release of this film someday, and with English subtitles. I'm telling you right now, that I would gladly pay over fifty bucks for this movie in High Definition Blu-Ray because Nastassja Kinski is just so beautiful.

UPDATE: Even though an English subtitled release of this film was never released on DVD, they will be releasing this on Blu-Ray.

NOW! NEW UPDATE!  The quality of this Blu-Ray is AWFUL! This totally un-mastered (VHS quality) video has no right being put on Blu-ray.  The picture quality of the art on the packaging is so deceiving, like you expect to see a High Definition picture quality! Even the sound crackles like a filthy old VHS tape.

If I knew that it was going to be THIS BAD, I would have never bought it. Oh man, this breaks my heart.

I'll give it three stars although I really mean maybe two and a half because I do love the fact that Nastassja Kinski is in this mild piece of Italian fluff. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't own this movie at all.

*To be honest, the DVR that I bought from somebody on EBay looks better on that DVR, than this Blu-Ray does. But, I'll keep this because it does have an English voice overdub, and English subtitles if I choose to hear the original Italian dub.",1426291200,8,2508,4.428260869565217

Friends put the seed in his head that she may be his daughter, which he can't prove one way or the other. He's torn by the guilt of this possibility; he's also concerned about her youth - a completely different generation: do they have anything in common? But at the end he goes off with her anyway. The acting leaves much to be desired, but it's an interesting idea. WARNING: The dubbing is terrible.",1131321600,8,501,4.516483516483516
7030702,4,B00U7XR5T4,"They edited and dubbed in english an Italian masterpiece. I saw this picture in Italian.
The difference is profound. Taking out  Marcello  and Nastajia's voices in Italian just guts the
throbbing heart of beauty and emotion out of an age Old human dilemma of sex, love and
mortality. Imagine Mel Gibson's the Passion of Christ in English and you get my drift.
I loved Claudia Cardinale, because she could deck anybody in French, German, English and Italian.
See her Fitzcaraldo with Klaus Kinski in German, and the Leopard in Italian with Burt Lancaster.
Nastasjia Kinski is that good in Italian as a teenager. 4 stars is generous in English.",1470528000,,642,4.8807339449541285
7030703,5,B00U7XR5T4,"Nasstasja Kinski, at this point in her life, was one of the most beautiful women in the world.  Her beauty and her sensuality made this movie very special.  She plays Franscesca, a young college student who falls in love with a middle-aged architect played by Marcello Mastroianni.  The story takes place in Rome.  Julio (Mastroianni) leads a complicated life.  We learn later on that he had dated Francesca's mother twenty years ago.  Julio lost contact with her shortly after the break up.

If you are a fan of Ms. Kinski, you simply must have this movie.  I bought it on Amazon and watch it on my PS4.  Highly recommended.",1460851200,4,625,4.660550458715596

7030719,2,B00U7XR5T4,"This is pretty much a throwaway movie, an Italian titillation flick that isn't particularly sexy, even though it has Nastassja Kinski and Ania Perroni playing a pair of promiscuous beauties that are college roommates.

Marcello Mastroiannni, in his mid-fifties at the time of this movie, was still far too handsome to be playing a futzy character like ""Giulio"" a bored architect having a crisis in his confidence.  Likewise, Nastassja Kinski was one of the great screen beauties, comparable to Sophia Loren and Ingrid Bergman, but she's reduced here to playing well below her natural intelligence level.  Kinski has publicly stated that she regrets the nudity in some of her films, and this must be among the movies she was referencing.

In reality, she's the only reason to watch the movie, because she is absolutely gorgeous.  That is a quality which can be appreciated even with the sound off, and that might be the best way to view the film... because as many have noted here, the dubbing is absolutely awful.  Since Kinski appears to be speaking her lines in English, and Mastroianni's voice was well known to filmgoers, it makes absolutely no sense that the makers of this movie would have used substitute voices for both Mastroianni and Kinski.

The dialogue is pretty terrible, and the plot is based on an unbelievable conceit... that jaded twenty year old beauties are hankering after worn-out, middle-aged Lotharios.  It couldn't have been a good experience for either Marcello or Nastassja, given that they were both good actors when they were given good material to work with.

The best that can be said is that maybe this flick was a factor in Roman Polanski's decision to cast Kinski in her next movie, the unforgettable ""Tess"".",1432944000,5,1742,4.958762886597938

7030721,4,B00U7XR5T4,Let me start by saying that I'm happy to finally have this film in my collection after having seen it more than thirty years ago when I was a teenager. It's the story of an unhappily married man (Marcello Mastrianni) who begins an affair with a young woman (Nastassja Kinski) and then shortly after learns she just may be the daughter he never knew about. Of course this revelation complicates his relationship with this young woman and forces him to make a decision. Will he remain in a friendship with this radiant beauty or give into his desires? Mastrianni gives a fine performance as a torn man. And Kinski is absolutely stunning in this film. My only complaint is that I was expecting this Blu-ray edition of the film to be re-mastered in high definition but the quality is that of a DVD.,1431388800,16,794,4.559440559440559

8704633,4,B00U7XR5T4,"The ever-charming Marcello Mastroianni as a nice, dirty old man and the exquisite Nastassja Kinski star, along with a bevy of other beauties. This was the Europe I remember from forty-odd years ago, even though I didn't live the carefree student life pictured here. I became a huge fan of Ms. Kinski in Roman Polanski's Tess, which came out about 2 years later. This film was also made during an era when it was permissible for adolescents to perform nude scenes (cf. Pretty Baby with Brooke Shields). I read that she wished she hadn't consented to doing those scenes at age 17. Still, I wanted to see this film for reasons other than just her, but she was certainly a selling point. I wanted to mention a scene where Mastroianni's character is carrying around a copy of Homo Faber by Max Frisch. This was adapted as the movie Voyager in 1991 by Vlker Schlondorff and starred Sam Sheppard and Julie Delpy. The plot hinges upon a man falling for a much younger woman, only to discover belatedly a tragic connection between them. As the plot of Stay As You Are explores a similar theme (not only is she young enough to be his daughter, might she actually be his daughter?), I just thought I'd mention it. Otherwise, a nice romance film for the pre-Viagra era, when older men liked to think younger women liked them, in spite of diminished virility.",1528070400,,1346,4.6125

Instead many inhabit this untenably painful nether region, unable to commit in either direction. It is bittersweet to watch and beautifully told: Mastroianni's performance in perfectly understated reflecting his frozen indecision and that makes this film worth watching.
""What have you got in that little head of yours?"" Mastroianni asks son objet d'amour: Kinski may be the one of the most devastatingly beautiful women of the 20th C but I am not a fan of her acting and the ditzy sex kitten cliche is so annoying and a huge turn off. But by far the biggest weakness is the horrendous dubbing, its timed well to match the lip movements but the voices are unrealistic and utterly devoid of nuance.

8704640,1,B00U7XR5T4,"I love Mastroianni, but this was truly one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The direction and acting are somewhere between 70s softcore porn flick and a daytime soap opera. The plot is completely contrived and its two main pillars-the love story and the question of Francesca's origins- seem to exist only because each lacked the substance to carry the film on its own. Yes, Kinski is beautiful and previous cinematic experiences will invest Marcello with a dynamism that his actual performance is lacking, but there is nothing of substance to be had here. The film imparts no insight on the tension between erotic infatuation and potential incest. It has nothing beyond the banal to communicate about intergenerational romance. When compared to films that explore similar themes like Eric Rohmer's Le Genou de Claire, Stay As You Are feels like a parody of an art film...and perhaps even that is too much praise.",1470960000,,918,4.922580645161291
