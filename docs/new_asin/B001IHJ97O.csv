There are others that I would NOT purchase as a set because I either have one or more of the DVD's or am just not interested in the rest of the collection. I have made repeated requests to Amazon to release these DVD's as individual DVD's, as well as a set, so we have a choice. So far to NO avail. If others reading this agree with me then contact Amazon and express your support. I would gladly buy ""Cash McCall"" & ""Sex & The Single Girl"" which are both very good movies.

3648590,3,B001IHJ97O,"Two of the movies, SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS and GYPSY are well known great movies and have been available for a long time, So?
INSIDE DAISY CLOVER was a critical success in the UK from 1965 on.
It is a conceited movie, full of its own importance. The actors are uniformly bad, a real triumph for Rober Mulligan! The novel was a dud too.
BOMBERS B52 should have been a nice commercial movie helmed by a really good director GORDON DOUGLAS (going back to OUR GANG), later responsible for an unsung masterpiece SYLVIA, and known for the four SINATRA movies and superior westerns.
It is sunk by a stupid subject and the wooden ZIMBALIST. Even the great KARL MALDEN is boring.
CASH MC CALL is a minor triumph (in its original 1,33 ratio). The CAMERON HAWLEY novel was good. JOSEPH PEVNEY had been an actor, then an U-I director from 1950 to 1957. and runs a tight ship. That was the kind of commercial picture which had the French movie buffs celebrating the Hollywood films, rather than the mediocre so called (European) ""classics"".
It has a dream cast: DEAN JAGGER (outstanding as usual). WOOD looking very very nice, GARNER ideal as the tycoon (not destructive, it was 1959),
plus HENRY JONES, NINA FOCH and a good cinematography. Who can ask for anything more? For our American friends, the French title was: ""THAT MAN IS A SHARK"" (RIO BRAVO French title was: RIO BRAVO. You can't be creative
all of the time. It is the true outsider of the lot.
SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL is a perfect modern comedy that you can watch again and again. Everythings works together: the music (great title song), the cinematography, all the actors. WOOD was never more beautiful.
RICHARD QUINE had directed wonderful pictures: MY SISTER EILEEN/OPERATION MAD BALL/BELL BOOK AND CANDLE/IT HAPPENED TO JANE and STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET (not a comedy, from the Evan Hunter novel)
He and BLAKE EDWARDS had been friends and written together, in the late forties I think. EDWARDS was to direct the following year THE GREAT RACE, a comic masterpiece who sunk at the box office. CURTIS and WOOD co-starred again. WOOD playing the same type of character who is not as worldly as she thinks.
The three stars are for the strange collection. GYPSY/SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS/SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL would rate five stars, CASH MC CALL four stars, BOMBERS B52 two stars and INSIDE DAISYCLOVER huge boos.",1228089600,5,2356,4.707021791767555
3648591,5,B001IHJ97O,"Even though this is called a Signature Collection, the artwork I have seen doesn't indicate the same classic style that is present on the other Warner signature collections. The last one to be released was the Burt Lancaster Signature collection late in 2007. This set shall contain six films.

SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS (1961) - Directed by Elia Kazan stars Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty as young lovers during the 1920's who can't be together due to society's external pressures and the internal pressures of the girl's fragile mental state.

SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL (1964)Directed by Richard Quine. Natalie Wood stars as Helen Gurley Brown. A writer at a tabloid magazine (Tony Curtis) wants to interview Miss Brown, but the only way he can do so is to masquerade as a patient.

INSIDE DAISY CLOVER (1965) Directed by Robert Mulligan. Set in the 1930's Daisy is a teenager who becomes a star against the odds. She has to find a way to deal with her newfound fame. Christopher Plummer plays the studio executive that controls Daisy's every move.

GYPSY (Deluxe Edition) (1962) Directed by Mervyn LeRoy. Story of the burlesque queen includes a great performance by Rosalind Russell as her stage mother and Karl Malden as the agent/family friend. Gypsy is not the center of attention of the act or of the family until her sister - the real star up to that point - elopes at the ripe old age of 13. That younger sister is played by Ann Jillian.

BOMBERS B-52 (1957) - Directed by Gordon Douglas. Stars Karl Malden as Master Sergeant Chuck V. Brennan who has a strong dislike for hot-shot  Colonel Jim Herlihy, the commanding officer of the 329th Bomber Squadron. When Herlihy takes a liking to Brennan's daughter (Natalie Wood) the dislike grows even more. Usually these kind of films have the enlisted man liking the officer's daughter. This reverses things a bit.

CASH MCCALL (1960)directed by Joseph Pevney. James Garner plays the title character - an entepreneur who has already had an affair with Natalie Wood's character. When they meet again it is when McCall is trying to buy her father's company.

Brainstorm, Natalie Wood's final film, shall be released separately. There is no word on extra features yet.",1225324800,38,2212,4.848806366047746

Gypsy was the reason I got this set and the other films to me seem like ""filler"". There are MANY other great and talented actresses that deserve a box set from Warner Brothers (Myrna Loy comes to mind) over this particular one. Maybe she is an aquired taste, not sure. Everyone else reviewing this set seems to like it (or her), but I am somewhat disappointed. Would prefer to see other actresses being showcased instead.

3648670,3,B001IHJ97O,"One of the biggest marketing successes of the last few years was the creation of these DVD ""collections"" of borderline movies that probably would realize small sales if they were offered independently.  Just place a sexy picture of the star on the case and you're in business.

None of the movies in this package are outstanding, and yet none of them are real clunkers either.  They're just average.  Even ""Splendor in the Grass,"" which is the most acclaimed of the lot, is slow and somewhat talky.

Unless you are a die-hard Natalie Wood fan, you're probably going to be less than pleased purchasing this bundle.",1254528000,,613,4.8
3648671,4,B001IHJ97O,"Gorgeous Natalie Wood was a huge star in the late 50s and early 60s, and she became a lightning rod for issues of sex and marriage at a time when the sexual revolution was just starting and these issues were coming out of the shadows.

Without a doubt, the most important movie in the set is ""Splendor in the Grass"", a top drawer classic directed by Elia Kazan. Not only is this Natalie Wood's finest role, period, but Warren Beatty premiered in this movie and he hit the ground running. This is a bittersweet Romeo and Juliet story about family and peer relationships that remains relevant for all time, and it moves so quickly and passionately to tell it's ironic and poignant story. Kazan's economy of storytelling is most unusual and quite literary, especially by today's standards. The story structure and editing are as tight as any film ever made, and nothing ever, ever gets bogged down.

Pat Hingle as Bud's overbearing father is unforgettable. There are so many great character actors from the period, but an often overlooked one is Kermit Murdock as Dean Pollard (at Yale), who finds himself sandwiched in between the father's desires and those of Bud. As the story moves forward, Bud's father becomes increasingly desperate to maintain control of Bud, but instead loses control of his own life. That confrontation between Ace Stamper and Dean Pollard in the Dean's office very nicely juxtaposes the 1929 stock crash with the clash over academic goals. ""What's the matter with people?"" Ace says, even as his own irrationality is quite apparent.

Cash McCall is another movie in the set, with James Garner as a millionaire industrialist. The whole movie is about mergers and takeovers in the television manufacturing business. Natalie plays Cash McCall's love interest, and once again the sexual mores of the early 60's bring on shades of shame, embarassment and conscience which you will seldom find today.

Aside from the beautiful Natalie Wood, and James Garner in the prime of his career, the full bevy of character actors in Cash McCall are almost more fun to watch than the lead actors.

Roland Winters as General Danvers specializes in avuncular mischief and rank indignation. Edward Platt (George Kaplan's attorney from North by Northwest) is fascinating to watch, even with a toupee on his head. And Parley Baer, E. G. Marshall, Olan Soule, and Dean Jagger are also terrific to see in this fresh and vital look at American industry in it's heyday. What I'd like to know is what the heck happened to American manufacturing of domestic products like televisions? And why did all the money and man power end up going into government and military technologies?

You might find part of the answer in the third movie in the set, Bombers B-52, a post-Korean War epic, brought to you through the courtesy of the Military-Industrial Complex, starring Natalie, Karl Malden, and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. It is the earliest release of the movies in the set, with a gorgeous, elegiac score by Leonard Rosenman.

The story of a father and a suitor who battle for Natalie's love dovetails somewhat awkwardly with the B-52, the massive aircraft which is an icon-like technology presence in the movie. While Efrem Zimbalist falls in love with Natalie, the audience is supposed to fall in love with the B-52.

The footage of the enormous B-52 is impressive and ideally suited to the massively wide Cinemascope format, and obviously Warner Bros and the Air Force worked hand in hand to bring us this ode to military technology and Cold War supremacy.

Efrem and Natalie are really good, but Karl Malden as Master Mechanic Sergeant Chuck V. Brennan, the righteous man with all the tools, truth, and integrity, is generally annoying and more or less weighs the movie down.

Yet for all it's flaws and a campy story that plods along, I like this movie because it evokes the 50's and the Cold War so well. It recalls a time, almost forgotten, when fighting the Commies was just about what everybody drew their next breath for. And when, after ten years of the Great Depression and almost as many years of war and scary conflict, luxurious material things were a real novelty and something to appreciate and even discuss.

Inside Daisy Clover is a well-produced but peculiar tale of stardom, with a most unsatisfying ending. A miscreant, disobedient ""flower-child"" of the 30's, Clover (Natalie) is adopted by a Hollywood movie mogul, played wonderfully by Christopher Plummer in his usual smug and self-confident mold, but the movie somehow lobotomizes Miss Clover's transformation into a star. That most important part of her metamorphosis is neatly left out of the story! She is pulled off the street, and the next thing we know, she appears at her movie premiere in a full length gown, with thousands of fans, yet not quite sure why she is there.

Natalie, Plummer, and Robert Redford are cool to watch, but the story is really weird. Nevertheless, this is an entertaining, if bizarre, film. Some parts of it are pretty good.

The 5th movie in the set, ""Gypsy"", I found unwatchable because I can't tolerate most musicals -- mostly because I find in musicals formalized obsessive-compulsive behavior. But when an actor starts singing -- forget it, I just completely lose my suspension of disbelief.

On to the final movie in the set, ""Sex and The Single Girl"", a comedy starring Natalie and Tony Curtis. Natalie runs a sex and love research institute and Tony is a reporter from a tabloid magazine trying to discredit her methods, ostensibly by pretending to seek help from her with his own love life. The Neil Hefti score, the costumes, the locations, and the generally silly mood date this movie to exactly 1964.

Henry Fonda and Lauren Bacall are embarassingly bad as a disharmonious middle-aged couple, but I guess they're SUPPOSED to be bad. Now Tony and Natalie -- they're something else.

Tony Curtis is kind of a sleazy stand-in for Cary Grant, but on the other hand, he's perfect for this role, and very handsome fodder for Natalie, who is at her luscious best.

But the madcap craziness will get excessive at times, especially the big ""car chase"" sequence at the end of the movie, with it's nutty dual-floating-cars-in-front-of-a-rear-projection-screen-with-dialogue shots. If you don't mind the excessive and vapid zaniness, Sex and The Single Girl is a very entertaining bit of silly fluff that takes itself pretty seriously.",1251158400,,6430,4.927911275415896

3648674,3,B001IHJ97O,"Natalie Wood definitely deserves a tribute. This DVD box set, comprised of movies she made for Warner Brothers studio, is definitely a mixed bag. No one will argue that ""Bombers B-52"" or ""Cash McCall"" are especially memorable, or among Natalie's best work. That leaves us with two classics (""Splendor In The Grass"" and ""Gypsy""), one silly farce (""Sex And The Single Girl"") and one oddity that is interesting and worthwhile (""Inside Daisy Clover"").
  ""Splendor In The Grass"" (1961) is easily the best film in this box set, and probably the quintessential Natalie Wood film. Deanie and Bud (Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty) are in love, but her mother (Audrey Christie) tells her that ""nice girls don't enjoy sex."" Deanie is confused, especially with the example of Bud's promiscuous and free-spirited sister Jenny (Barbara Loden) before her. Bud wants to stay on the family farm and marry Deanie, but his overbearing father (Pat Hingle) wants him to go to Harvard. Deanie's sexual repression leads to a dangerous suicide attempt at a waterfall (Natalie did the  frightening swimming scene herself) and mental breakdown. Natalie, who received an Oscar nomination, is an appealing mixture of poignancy and strength, and Warren Beatty is quite impressive in his film debut. ""Splendor"" holds up extremely well. If you don't believe me, just watch the terrible TV remake from the 1980's  with Melissa Gilbert, mis-cast and totally out of her depth, in Natalie's role. The original, with Natalie, is a classic. (5 Stars). 1961 was an excellent year, professionally, for Natalie. Following ""Splendor,"" she gave another beautiful performance, as Maria in the Oscar winning smash mega-hit ""West Side Story.""

  ""Gypsy"" (1962): After having her vocals dubbed by Marni Nixon in ""West Side Story"", Natalie's singing is all her own in this film version of the Broadway classic. Natalie is perfect as Louise Hovac, whether  as a tomboy, dressed in baggy clothes with a page-boy haircut, or later, all woman, sexily stripping off as sophisticated Gypsy Rose Lee. Rosalind Russell is just fine (with vocal help from Lisa Kirk) as her ambitious, driven, and delusional, Mama Rose. I certainly did not miss the hideous Broadway hag known as Ethel Merman. (4 Stars out of 5).

""Sex And The Single Girl"" (1964) Tony Curtis, working for a smutty tabloid magazine, is determined to prove that Natalie Wood, as ""sexpert"" Dr. Helen Brown, is actually (Gasp!) a virgin! Whether she is or not is never anwered.
This ridiculous sex farce soon runs out of steam and becomes a slapstick farce, with a wildly prolonged car chase on the freeway. (3 Stars Out of 5).

  ""Inside Daisy Clover"" (1965) By age 26, Natalie Wood is too adult to be entirely convincing as a 15 year old ""child singing star"", but she does have the Hollywood credentials. The page boy haircut that worked so well in ""Gypsy"" does not work so well for ""Daisy Clover."" Daisy is supposed to be a singing sensation, in the mode of  a teenage Judy Garland. Natalie's vocals are dubbed by another lady again. Marni Nixon's dubbing for Natalie in ""West Side Story"" was well-done. The dubbing for Natalie in ""Daisy"" (not Marni Nixon) is bad...well, honestly, awful!
Everything else about the film seems a bit off, too. Gavin Lambert's script veers wildly between macabre black comedy, satire, and melodrama. The best performances are given by Robert Redford as Wade Lewis, the ""closeted"" gay matinee idol who encourages Daisy's rebellious nature, marries her, and promptly abandons her; and an especially effective and creepy Christopher Plummer as ""Prince Of Darkness"" movie mogul Raymond Swan. In Natalie's best scene, she has an altogether too convincing and frightening nervous breakdown inside a recording booth. The overall film is uneven, but worthwhile and interesting, nevertheless.

2--splendor in the grass - a must have film even if you are not a wood fan, if you liked a streetcar named desire and this proprty is condemend this is a film for you.

3--SEX & THE SINGLE GIRL - this for me was the main reason i wanted the box set. its a comedy staring strong leads and a strong supporting cast. this is one of the most requested films of natalie wich leads to the question ""why didn't they release it sooner?""

4--inside daisy clover - this is a great film from the acomplished drama star. robert redford also gives a great performance with wood. the breakdown scene (in sound and in silence) is some of her best work.

5&6--cash mccall/bombers b-52 - these are pretty good films, wood as always is beautiful. these 2 films are good but i would much rather have liked to have ""love with the proper strainger"" & Penelope"" instead.

3648679,4,B001IHJ97O,"A generation of moviegoers identify Natalie Wood with Maria, the character she portrayed in the Academy Award-winning ""West Side Story"" (1961).  Her film career dates back to the 1940's, when she appeared as a child star in several films, the most famous, ""The Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947), when she was only nine.

""The Natalie Wood Collection"" continues the admirable policy by Warner Home Video of assembling movies featuring popular stars into box sets.  The six feature films in this new collection are a mixed bag.  ""Bombers B-52"" (1957) is a routine love story costarring Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., as Wood's love interest and Karl Malden as her career military father who objects to their romance.  Unfortunately, Wood is overshadowed here by CinemaScope photography of jet planes doing intricate aerial maneuvers.

""Cash McCall"" (1960), heavy on soap opera, costars James Garner in the title role of a business tycoon who thrives on buying and selling companies for profit.  McCall's acquisition plan for Grant Austen's (Dean Jagger) company is complicated when he learns that Austen's daughter (Wood) is the same girl with whom he once had a summer romance.

""Sex and the Single Girl"" (1964) pairs Wood with Tony Curtis in a romantic comedy with supporting roles by Henry Fonda and Lauren Bacall.
 Two show business films, ""Gypsy"" (1962) and ""Inside Daisy Clover"" (1965), go behind the scenes of vaudeville and motion pictures, respectively.  In both, Wood starts out as an average girl who, because of looks and drive, blossoms into a star while learning that stardom has its dark downside.

The best film in the set is ""Splendor in the Grass"" (1961).  Written by William Inge (""Picnic"") and directed by Elia Kazan (""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""On the Waterfront""), it marked the screen debut of Warren Beatty.  He and Wood portray teenage lovers filled with lust who are ripped apart by the repressive small-town mentality of 1920's Kansas.  The chemistry between the two leads is excellent, and Wood turns in one of her best performances in a Romeo-and-Juliet tale where social class forms the barrier.  The characters are all well faceted, and the supporting cast exceptional (Pat Hingle, Sandy Dennis, Barbara Loden).  No film of the era illustrated better the conflict between sexual desire and repression.  Its theme of rebellion against parental authority would find its way into films increasingly throughout the 1960's.",1233446400,16,2436,5.173469387755102
