8113562,3,B000ERHFV6,"I was rather disappointed with this purchase. This was a documentary type DVD that skipped around a lot and did not give much information about life on the trail.  If your doing research to plan your own hike then look elsewhere, this will not be any help at all.",1486512000,,263,4.36734693877551
8113563,5,B000ERHFV6,"I really enjoyed Scott's first documentary on the PCT (""Walk"") and, surprisingly, liked this one even better. It's a nice follow-up to the first film, but it also stands alone as an excellent piece of outdoors film making. I especially enjoyed the tighter pace of this film, that he hiked a longer chunk this time and that there are even more people this time telling their unusual, humorous and moving stories.  Highly recommended to anyone who is thinking about hiking or is merely fascinated by the Pacific Crest Trail, is curious about the type of folks who set out on a thru-hike, and for those who especially like wry humor with their docs. :) Beware of salt-crazed deer!",1141344000,2,677,4.737288135593221
8113564,5,B000ERHFV6,"Scott Herriott's ""Still Walking"" was a thrill to watch, not only because I was one of the hikers who participated in walking along the Pacific Crest Trail in 2005, but mostly importantly because the filmmaker obtains ""inside information"" from the hikers themselves about their adventures on and off of the trail.  Scott's film not only depicts the tales of hikers on-trail and during town stops, but it also focuses on what a ""through-hike"" entails through his use of humor and sarcastic wit.  Thus, combined with a few serious moments and the filmmaker's own on-trail experience, the film is a great story that will keep the viewer entertained throughout.  Therefore, I highly recommend obtaining a copy of ""Still Walking"" and Scott's intitial production, ""Walk"" to anyone who is interested to learn about the community of through-hikers, to those of you who are hiking veterans, and to anyone who has a passion for the Pacific Crest Trail.",1141257600,3,941,5.058064516129032
