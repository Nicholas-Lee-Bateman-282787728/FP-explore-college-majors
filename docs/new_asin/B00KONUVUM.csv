6437169,5,B00KONUVUM,"Although the sound was not excellent quality, I did enjoy this. I realize that it is an outdoor theater, some things were very low and some were very loud.",1440633600,,155,4.379310344827586
6437170,5,B00KONUVUM,Absolutely impeccable performance by Globe...Colin Morgan (of Merlin fame) was great as were all the performances....if Shakespere fan.......Highly recommend.....The DVD was in perfect working order and arrived earlier than expected,1440374400,2,232,6.766666666666667
6437171,4,B00KONUVUM,Enjoyable production but not the best I've ever seen,1440374400,,52,4.888888888888889
6437172,4,B00KONUVUM,"It is refreshing to see a comedy/drama without intensive use of high tech special effects.  It was up to to the actors/actresses to carry the show.
That is to say the show was preformer driven as opposed to special effects driven.  Shakespeare's Globe Theater delivers as authenic as possible the experience of the performance Shakespearean play as it may have been done in Skakespeare's day.",1440374400,11,392,5.015384615384615
6437173,5,B00KONUVUM,"Finally, a production of Shakespeare's Tempest on video that understands that for all of the things that make this play significant as a late Shakespeare work (and likely his official farewell to the theater), at its heart this play is a comedy from the beginning to the end.  The Tempest deals with serious issues resulting from Great Britain's early attempts at colonization in the New World, but even the victimization of the aboriginal character Caliban is lost if we do not see through the comedy Prospero's foolishness and cruelty in how he lords over this island of his banishment.",1438041600,15,588,4.9393939393939394
6437174,5,B00KONUVUM,"Although I did not purchase this dvd through Amazon, I DID get to see this actual production live when this was done at the Globe, and I happened to be visiting London with my husband at the time; it was my first visit to the Globe Theater, which was amazing in itself, but this production of ""The Tempest"" was THE best production, live or otherwise, that we'd ever seen of this play (certainly much better than the horrifically dull and humorless film verision with a miscast Helen Mirren as the pointlessly gender-swapped ""Prospera""-- actually, EVERYONE in that movie was dull, miscast and humorless!  Pass on that one if you haven't seen it yet!).  The very talented and funny Brit actor Roger Allum (whom we already knew as one of the cast members of the very funny and scathing Brit political parody tv series ""The Thick of It"", which also had the Scottish powerhouse actor Peter Capaldi-- the newest Doctor Who-- in his breakout role as a scathingly funny and foul-mouthed political spin doctor) was excellent as Prospero, giving that character moments of humanity and humor that I'd never noticed in previous versions.  Even though I've seen a ""fancier"" stage version done by the RSC on dvd since then, with the great Christopher Plummer in the role of Prospero (and how could he NOT be good in that role?), Plummer's supporting cast was far weaker then Allum's at the Globe, and the RSC's production itself was far too over-reliant on overproduced and noisy special-effects, whereas this Globe version acheives so much more with a much simpler and special-effects-free production-- except of course, for the very real-- and very appropriate-- rainstorm which just happened to come down while we were watching the play (luckily, my husband and I weren't in the ""groundlings"" open-to-the-sky section in front of the stage, but chose to sit in one of the covered balcony sections instead, so we could still enjoy the play without getting drenched by God's own ""tempest"" special-effect! :D) that afternoon, and apparently it also rained a little during the show that they filmed for the dvd, which might've been later on the same day/evening that we saw it for all I know (I don't remember them having mentioned filming the exact showing that we were at, and the audience looked slightly different than I remembered it-- ours had school groups in it since it was a matinee, and by the end of this filmed production, it was getting dark already)- but that certainly didn't seem to dampen the audiences' spirits or enthusiasm for the play-- this was so well-acted, and so much fun to watch, especially with the addition of a couple of extra dance numbers (giving Allum a chance, as I mentioned earlier, to inject a bit of humor into Prospero's normally serious and intimidating character by joining in with the silly dance moves-- trust me, it works), that I would recommend it for parents wanting to introduce Shakespeare to their kids-- the school groups that I saw sitting across from us in the audience certainly seemed to be genuinely engaged in the action and really enjoying it, which made me wish that I had been able to see more live productions like that when I was a school kid-- I might've become more interested in Shakespeare's works at a much earlier age, as most American children probably would-- if more of us had had the opportunities to be exposed to excellently staged live productions like that-- as Shakespeare was MEANT to be seen-- rather than only seeing it in the classroom as dry and lifeless text on the page, so it's much harder to understand what's really going on without the benefit of seeing it within the context of the emotions and action of the characters being acted out on stage!  No wonder the Brits have so many good stage (and screen) actors-- these lucky Brit kids get the chance to be immersed and well-educated in the theater arts from a very young age by getting to see so much good Shakespeare in their own backyard!  (Meanwhile, we've SO many Shakespeare plays so BADLY done in L.A., by actors who clearly don't even understand what they're really saying or trying too hard to ""hip"" it up for modern audiences.... yeesh!).  I've also just recently received the Globe's productions of ""Henry V"" and ""Twelfth Night"" (starring the very funny and talent bon vivant Brit actor/comedian Stephen Fry as Malvolio) on dvd also from my husband as birthday gifts, both of which look excellent and I'll follow up with reviews on them as well as soon as I've had a chance to watch them both!  In the meantime, I highly recommend this one for a start!  Also bear in mind while you're watching it that ""The Tempest"" was supposedly Shakespeare's last solo play that he wrote, so it's particularly moving to listen to Prospero's farewell monologue at the end.",1433289600,26,4792,4.792978208232445
6437175,5,B00KONUVUM,"Best Production of The Tempest out there (and we've seen about 8). True to the script. Has an air of light and humor like Shakespeare meant it to be! Also shows the serious undertones (plotting nobles, enslaved characters, revenge, ...). Well staged. Well done.",1478476800,4,261,4.954545454545454
6437176,5,B00KONUVUM,"While I would not consider myself an avid follower of Shakespeare, as I find his work confusing in parts, I enjoyed this video immensely. Roger Allam was perfect in his role, and Colin Morgan is the absolute best. The entire show was so captivating, with just the right amount of drama and comedy, that I found myself totally into this video. If all of Shakespeare's work is this entertaining, I need to watch more of them. I would recommend this video to all.",1478044800,4,460,4.554216867469879
6437177,5,B00KONUVUM,Excellent performances! Colin Morgan's Ariel is unique! No wonder why he won Best Featured Actor in a New Production of a Play in the 2013 Broadway World West End Awards.,1477612800,,170,4.7
6437178,5,B00KONUVUM,The play was very well done it was funny and very entertaining. I would highly recommend the tempest !,1473206400,,102,4.421052631578948
6437179,5,B00KONUVUM,Great production of The Tempest!,1471478400,,32,5.6
6437180,5,B00KONUVUM,Highly recommend! I couldn't figure out how to get the subtitles to work but nonetheless the production is wonderful. During the first half it was raining so it was interesting to see the audience getting wet as they watched a live production at the Globe facsimile. Real devotees! You won't regret watching this version.,1469059200,,321,4.962962962962963
6437181,2,B00KONUVUM,"The performances at Shakespeare's Globe are usually good. Not this one. Roger Allam reads his lines jerkily, with way too many pauses in strange places. Did he learn his part sufficiently?? The only actor I can unreservedly praise is James Garnon as Caliban. Not only does he have a good sense of balance (he sits on his heels a lot) but he also reads his lines with sensitivity, not the ogre Caliban is in some productions. Also good are Ariel and Ferdinand.",1467504000,2,459,4.609756097560975
6437182,5,B00KONUVUM,"Spectacular,all actors are amazing",1466899200,,34,7.75
6437183,5,B00KONUVUM,The best comedic version of The Tempest!,1466812800,,40,4.857142857142857
6437184,3,B00KONUVUM,"I'd give this lively production  five stars if it were not for the lack of subtitles, which are important to me with Shakespeare films.",1461888000,6,135,4.625
8660419,4,B00KONUVUM,"After years of having only the BBC's lackluster production and Derek Jarman's very odd version, we are now have three excellent productions to choose. My personal favorite of the new entries is the CBC Stratford Shakespeare Festival version, partly because I was lucky enough to see it live. Not only is the cast headed by the incomparable Christopher Plummer as Prospero but Julyana Soelistyo is so lithe and graceful as Ariel that I was ready to believe that she actually could fly.
That said, this new Globe Theatre production -- which is also a filmed stage production recorded in front of a live audience -- is a VERY close second. Roger Allan also heads a strong cast and he is excellent as Prospero (and I suppose more appropriate in that role in the sense that Prospero is really just middle-aged rather than old). As true with all the Globe Theatre videos, this version offers the chance to see how the original might have been staged in a playhouse from Shakespeare's era. I think this version would also prove more accessible to students in the classroom as it plays up more of the comic aspects of the action.
Just for completeness, I should add that the third verison of THE TEMPEST is Julie Taymor's film version with Helen Mirren as Prospera. While  changing the lead role to a female does create some interesting new aspects, Taymor's attempt to create a cinematic counterpart to Shakespeare's play does not work for me. I can recommend it only as a curiousity.",1521158400,,1477,4.747081712062257
8660420,5,B00KONUVUM,"Roger Allam and Colin Morgan are outstanding performers.  Not to mention Colin Morgan fans, Colin sings!, quite well I might add.  There is great humor with each talented actor/characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed this performance of  Shakespeare's Tempest.  There are morals here that effect everyone in human compassion, forgiveness, and love.  Their characters were in harmonious sync with each other and were all believable, and moving to the point I didn't want the Play to end. Very enjoyable cast!  Well done! I look forward to seeing more from Globe Theatre.",1518048000,,563,5.258426966292135
8660421,5,B00KONUVUM,"This version (very spare set and true to the Globe) is astounding and sucks you right in! Very funny,watch and listen carefully to get all the physical humor and snappy word play! 'Calaban' is wonderful, rude, silly and endearing.",1513814400,,230,4.923076923076923
8660422,2,B00KONUVUM,"This is regarding the condition of the DVD, not the content of the play. The package arrived with one of the CDs detached from the case, so you can imagine the amount of scratches on it. Thankfully it could play, but still it's not nice to have the CDs in that condition.",1507593600,,271,4.230769230769231
8660423,5,B00KONUVUM,Colin Morgan is the best,1506902400,,24,4.0
8660424,4,B00KONUVUM,"Another lovely Globe production. Roger Allam makes a fine Prospero, and Colin Morgan is terrific as Ariel.  A very enjoyable Tempest.",1500508800,,133,5.333333333333333
8660425,5,B00KONUVUM,"I saw a recorded live performance broadcast of this production, that's now offered on DVD, in a movie theater several months back, and I couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD.  My copy is due to be delivered on Friday (7/14/17).  I'm also not a huge fan of Shakespeare's plays (somewhat too intellectual for my tastes), but I found this performance captivating and riveting from beginning to end.  That said, if one likes this performance, absolutely check out Julie Taymor's staging of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" broadcast into theaters nearly two years back, and now available on DVD.  It is simply beyond magical!!!",1499817600,,625,4.923809523809524
8660426,5,B00KONUVUM,"This play is actually quite serious as it deals with the importance of learning the meaning of charity and compassion.  I do not purchase this particular play sight unseen; it is my favorite play and if the production gets it wrong, I can't bear it.  (The stars are for the play, not this production which I cannot rate.) Thus the character of Ariel is of paramount importance because it is he who, even in his own innocence to humanity, guides his master in that process.  Productions that demean the play in this purpose (by making it political, either in the context of Shakespear's time or ours) are doing him no service.  It is the most timeless play he ever wrote, the capstone of his career and...well, life.  FY I, I have not seen this version but I wish there were a way to preview it.  It is very, very difficult to find a really good version of it that captures its importance as a statement of our humanity.",1483660800,,919,4.440476190476191
8660427,4,B00KONUVUM,"The production is perfect and wonderful. Seeing the crowd appreciate Shakespeare's reconstructed Globe adds extra enjoyment, too.

The only drawback, for my use in the classroom, was the max volume on the DVD wasn't very loud. There were times that my students and I actually had to strain to hear the dialogue from specific characters, and that took a bit of the enjoyment away.",1482105600,3,379,4.921875
8660428,5,B00KONUVUM,Wonderful production of the Tempest. The Globe never disappoints!,1478822400,,65,6.333333333333333
