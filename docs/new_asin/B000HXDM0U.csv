2648356,5,B000HXDM0U,"Lot of great humour, interesting stories and it's resolutions. The only bad thing: there is a grain of truth in every joke.",1402963200,,123,4.636363636363637
2648357,5,B000HXDM0U,"Very Very funny.  Also, timely and timeless.  Nothing has changed in bureaucracy, civil service or politics.
This arrived on a rainy weekend, and I watched the entire set.  I've had this a couple months and watched the whole set three times now.",1396051200,,245,4.785714285714286
2648358,5,B000HXDM0U,"If you want to think, laugh out loud, and get angry all at the same time this is the series for you.  The situations are as fresh and as real as this morning's news story; the politics are both universal and timely.  The characters are like people you know or know of.  And the lies they tell are ones you've heard before and will hear over and over again.  You will laugh, laugh, and laugh some more no matter how many times you watch it.",1393027200,,439,4.129411764705883
2648359,5,B000HXDM0U,"Just loved it so far, remember it from years ago, and even today it is so typical of governments in UK and over here in Ausie Land.
A big thank you to the writers. they were very good.",1386720000,,184,3.8684210526315788
2648360,5,B000HXDM0U,These are the BBC TV series and I love these series for more than 30 years. Many episodes are politically so real and contain intelligent black humors. I reccomend you to watch these DVDs in addition to the books.,1385078400,,213,4.487179487179487
2648361,5,B000HXDM0U,"Very interesting from GB politic's ways of beeing, doing, deciding, and so on.
Extremely funny and sarcastic. The script writers have atually been employed afterwards as speech writers for real politicians.
It reminds you of how small we are, and how unsignificant, but also clever sometimes.",1379548800,,292,5.369565217391305
2648362,5,B000HXDM0U,British humor at its best. Fantastic actors. Smartest screenplay. Sometimes it seems that these stories might be quite real after all! Absolutely must have and must watch.,1371081600,,171,5.37037037037037
2648363,5,B000HXDM0U,"Lost of sense of humor, very mucha what si critized about politics today is in the series. You laugh a lot. Really amusing",1367971200,,122,4.3478260869565215
8142340,5,B000HXDM0U,"Here in the US...we call the government AND OUR PRESS (especially CNN and the Washington Post)...The Swamp...

These two great series happened before The Swamp got it's name...  This is a good example of a brave man...as both a cabinet minister AND Prime Minister...trying to drain the swamp only to find the swamp trying to drown him at every turn...and having it backfire almost every time...

I just wished out Public Blackmail System here didn't cut these two from their program lists...",1519430400,,491,4.963414634146342

8142343,1,B000HXDM0U,Fabulous series but this DVD package is for Europe not US,1438905600,2,57,4.2727272727272725
8142344,1,B000HXDM0U,"This video package did not play on my Blu-Ray.  I kept getting a notice saying it was ""INVALID"".  Since I'm a big fan of the ""Yes Minister"" and ""Yes Prime Minister"" series, this was a great disappointment.  One star should be no stars.",1438646400,2,235,4.4186046511627906
8142345,3,B000HXDM0U,"Kind of disappointed in this. First, if you buy it in the US, you have to change your media systems settings so it can play the DVD. Also, one of the episodes listed on one of the disk containers isn't even on the disk at all. Episodes are still good, but why even bother listing it on the case if certain episodes aren't even on the disk?",1434326400,2,339,4.074626865671642
8142346,5,B000HXDM0U,Hilarious.  A must if one is interested in the process of government.,1421798400,,69,4.75
