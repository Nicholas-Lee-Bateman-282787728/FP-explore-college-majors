2434770,1,B000BPK2KC,"This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made.  I have never read the book by Alice Hoffman, but judging by her credentials, she cannot be happy with the storytelling of this atrocity.  I know it is hard to effectively condense a novel in a screenplay, but this effort was extremely hollow at best.  Direct to DVD was the just reward for this pile of (...).",1139788800,,360,4.424242424242424
2434771,3,B000BPK2KC,"THE RIVER KING is a high profile film that went directly to DVD without the benefit of a theater run.  It is anyone's guess why a film of this quality should not make it commercially while there are so many less well-made movies that linger on the screens for weeks or months.  The film is well acted, well directed, beautifully photographed and well scored.

The possible reason for its lack of attention may have been due to some test screenings where the audience was asked to evaluate.  Despite all of the fine points of the film the problem lies in the screen adaptation by David Kane of the haunting novel by Alice Hoffman.  Too many loose ends do not a story make and in the final analysis it is difficult to converse with someone who has not seen the film just what it is about.

Ostensibly, THE RIVER KING is about a private prep school out in the snowy fields of somewhere, a place where secret societies still haze, faculty are still under the control of the school's funders, and appearances are far more important than truths.  Abel (Edward Burns) is called in to investigate the found drowned body of a student, and with his partner (John Kapelos) the two detectives suspect foul play - suicide, murder, hazing.  Their investigation includes questioning the victim's only friend Carlin (Rachelle Lefevre) and one photography and English Lit teacher Betsy (Jennifer Ehle).  But as the investigation proceeds, Abel has flashbacks to his childhood memories of his own older brother's suicide, dark secrets that have haunted him, and it is this psychic matrix which serves as the canvas for him to resolve the case as well as to relate to the various characters within the confines of the prep school.

Many of the questions raised by the narrative remain unanswered by this frustrating script, but the actors bring as much involvement and credibility as they are able to create a film of mystery and self-realization in the snow and ice of the fields around the school.  For those who wish more, reading Hoffman's novel will be more satisfying.  Grady Harp, February 06",1139702400,5,2080,4.779329608938547
2434772,2,B000BPK2KC,"The River King is a rather peculiar movie. It starts off as a standard police murder mystery and ultimately reveals itself to be something far more complex- and that is when it fails.

The film's failure in its later parts could be in the miscasting of Ed Burns. It is not Mr. Burns' fault however. He is excellent at first as a heroic small town policeman bucking the system to prove a murder. Very few young leading men have the rugged masculinity and down to earth qualities he brings to a role.( He may yet become his generation's Steve McQueen)

However, when the film turns into a more complex pyschological study, Mr. Burn's performance suffers. He projects total confidence on screen, and that is the problem. He is just not believable as the tormented man that his character is slowly revealed to be as the film progresses.

In the beginning, I thought he was the perfect choice for the part, but at the end I believe an actor who could more successfully convey mental torment would have been better. (joaquim phoenix would have been ideal).

The river king is still an ok film despite this- it just could have been a great one if it had starred a more appropriate actor in the lead.",1139443200,3,1192,4.55607476635514
2434773,4,B000BPK2KC,"Based on the novel by Alice Hoffman, THE RIVER KING is a little known film that is quite haunting and involving.  Edward Burns is wonderful as Abel Grey, a small town policeman investigating the apparent suicide of a young student at the local prep school.  John Kapelos effectively plays his not so honest partner.  As Burns investigates, evidence suggests that the victim did not kill himself, that he was perhaps murdered.

The movie is methodically paced and features beautiful Nova Scotia scenery; Burns becomes romantically involved with one of the teachers (a delightful Jennifer Ehle), who is engaged to another stuffy teacher.  Rachelle Lefevre as Carla, the victim's best friend, is also very good.  THE RIVER KING takes some subtle plot twists, one involving the suicide of his older brother when Abel was a child and this event plays a key part in Burns' investigation.  Alternately moody and grim, the movie is nonetheless a very good one, and benefits largely from Burns' strong presence, and a lovely score by Simon Boswell.",1138233600,7,1039,5.04093567251462
2434774,5,B000BPK2KC,"The River King, based from Alice Hoffman's novel is a haunting mystery story. The characters have lept from the pages of a novel and onto the big screen. Starring Jennifer Ehle (BBC Pride and Prejudice)

This moving drama begins with small town police finding a young boy's body in the river, frozen under the ice. From the moment the movie begins, the images, characters and scenery are straight from the novel it was based on.

As the story unfolds, we begin to learn about the boy who was found in the river, and the life he lead before he died. The audience becomes haunted by the mysterious and exclusive private college and its equally strange and elite students. The audience discovers each part of the story through flashbacks and through the memories and thoughts of the characters.

I personally attended a small, private and rather elite college on the East Coast. Throughout the novel I was getting feelings of Deja vu; convinced I was back at Benningon. Not only is the story totally engrossing and haunting, the film starts to become reality and capture the emotions of the audience, without the usual hollywood tricks.

This film blew away my expectations. I was a huge fan of the novel; I read it over and over again. I anticipated the movie being a dissapointment, but found myself captured and surprized, even though I knew what was going to happen next.

If you liked this movie, I would reccomend:

The River King written by Alice Hoffman, and any of her other novels.

Donna Tart's novel: The Secret History (similar plot and setting)

The movies: Practical Magic (by the same author), The Red Violin, Silence of the Lambs, What Lies Beneath, The Village.",1133222400,73,1676,4.775086505190312

The River King was one of those suggestions. I would give this movie a two thumbs up rating. It is entertaining and I liked the story.

2434880,4,B000BPK2KC,"I spotted this 2005 release on Amazon Prime and streamed the film.  It's an interesting thriller.  With ""Under the Dome"" on CBS and the Twilight series behind her, Rachelle Lefevre is given ""Introducing"" billing, although she certainly had built a strong television background.  As the only one who was a friend to the dead student Gus Pierce, her remembrance of him is critical to our investment in the story.  She delivers a strong performance.  Ed Burns as detective Abel Grey who has a problem with authority is an interesting character who works out his own personal demons about the death of his brother as he focuses on the current case.  Jennifer Ehle plays Betsy Chase, a teacher at the private school where Gus went.  She also serves as the love interest for Ed Burns' character, despite her engagement to another.  My daughter who watched with me thought the pace was a bit slow, but for a relatively low-budget film, I thought the screenplay, direction and acting worked well to tell this story.  Worth watching!

(2 stars is due to the cinematography or it would have been 1). I am so sick of the lame bullying/hazing storyline and obnoxious, entitled teenagers (some of whom look about 40) are simply not fun to watch, pretty sure I saw some characters from Happy Days in there too. Slow-burn as a genre is great; this is just a dumb movie - had it stayed American small town, with all the attendant characters it could have been great - Hogwarts up on the hill there just made it laughable, and the small town characters, caricatures of themselves: small minded, idiot father; fat, balding, corrupt police chief, the latter turned the movie into Serpico briefly (why didn't Burns call the FBI, that's what they're there for?), then all that just... ""went away"" and then the the murder mystery just ""went away""... all to the soundtrack of Deadwood (pretty sure it was). I think this drivel was once a book, I imagine reading that was even more painful than watching this - the only mystery I saw was why so many people liked it - but then people like reality TV, so I guess that explains it.",1397779200,,1207,4.5159817351598175

Likewise although it was certainly a slow and subtle story, I cant say I felt remotely bored or driven to fall asleep watching it as some  of the more negative reviews here state. Perhaps its all a matter of opinion in the end but as a fairly critical viewer of films I cant truly find any glaring faults in this one.

This movie imo once more, did a solid job of giving us glimpses into the events that lead up to the tragic end of a young man whose remains being found in the half frozen river open the movie.

I found the actors to all have given a fair performance with the lead actor bringing much of that charisma a lead actor needs to captivate you and make you want to be in their shoes.

Id personally say while there might be more compelling mystery movies out there that earn a 5 star, this movie left me satisfied at the end that the end was not some left field out of nowhere BS creating plot holes you could lose a planet in. It was an ending both calm yet intense and left one feeling some real measure of closure had been achieved for the main characters.

The hints of supernatural in it also pleased me as although I don't think this rates as a ghost story it does make you wonder just a tad here and there.

All in all if you enjoy a good mystery, and like to see a good man do whats right even when all around him seem willing to compromise morals in the name of the greater good for the whole and show wisdom when to let some things go when the truth can only cause greater pain then it can heal then surely give this one a go.",1390521600,2,1790,4.126436781609195

2434942,4,B000BPK2KC,I've seen better but I've also seen worse movies. Edward Burns is quite good as the cop who has doubts about the so called suicide. He is realistic in that he doesn't take things at face value; he questions everything. Watching the unfolding of the dead students life is interesting as you learn the layers of his life and relationships with others. The cinematography is striking and the story is good but the film is slow moving; definitely not an action film. I would recommend it and I will probably watch it again at a later date.

I think the movie gets to the essence of the book without going back into the historical background of ""The River King"". I like the mystical feel of the movie and the sexual tension between the forbidden lovers. The movie begins slowly and never really hits breakneck speed, and for many, I think that's a turn off. You just have to stick with it. It's like a comfort food movie I return to over and over --- a little sad and never really happy but very human and somehow other-worldly at the same time.",1383696000,3,663,4.442622950819672
2434946,5,B000BPK2KC,This movie is a great psychological drama. I love Alice Hoffman and this was one of my favorite of her books. The movie did not disappoint!,1382400000,,139,4.384615384615385
2434947,5,B000BPK2KC,"I understand that this movie is based on a novel of the same name, which may account for one of the few flaws I can think of as I evaluate this otherwise wonderful film. The flaw lies in the title. Nothing in the film suggests a king, much less one of a river. In spite of this, the story is captivating and the imagery is beautiful. Edward Burns is great and plays a very sensitive and human individual who battles ghosts of his past that emerge when he, as a policeman, is confronted with a death of a young man. I have watched this film many times and highly recommend it. Unable to decipher the title, I think I'll read the novel.",1380758400,2,634,4.204918032786885
2434948,3,B000BPK2KC,"I think the movie has its strong points. The cold, snowy, beautiful landscape is almost a character unto itself, imbuing the audience with a sense of isolation, as Gus so painfully endures isolation. The music sets the mystical tone. The actors: Edward Burns does a great job portraying Abel, the skeptical deputy who refuses to accept Gus's death as a suicide.  Rachelle Lafevre as Carlin, Gus's friend, is likable and believable in her role. Jennifer Ehle as Betsy (Abel's would-be love interest) is on a short list of ""name"" actors in this film, but I thought she totally over-acted her part. It just seemed to me that she worked too hard at it--you decide for yourself. Unlike another reviewer, I think they successfully tied up all the loose ends and gave the viewers a satisfactory if not happy ending. Abel learns something about his past which has haunted him, and he kindly spares Carlin from details of Gus's death that would devastate her. NOW, all that said, if you are a reader, please read the book first. It's probably my favorite of all of Alice Hoffman's books, and I've read most of them. Her craft is storytelling and there is such rich detail in the book that cannot possibly be played out in 90 minutes. After you read the book you can still enjoy the movie.

Edward Burns is great as Abel Gray, leading a young, unknown cast, with his emotionless persona. He makes the perfect cop, because of this stiff, focused personality. The story was strong, often throwing you off the track you are on, and using flashbacks to tell the background story. The music, montages, and flashbacks throughout the movie help to tell the story of the school, people, and town, almost as much the dialogue does. A pictures says 1000 words, in The River King, many obscure actions and random things have their own words and that helps make it unique.",1361577600,3,706,4.566929133858268

Is the police captain hiding something? Abel's partner is accepting gifts from the school and admits that the school has the police on a string. What do the students know about the boy's death? The question is whether Abel is letting his own personal history affect his judgement, or is he the only one who is willing to dig deeper into the mystery? The least satisfying part of the movie is the relationship between the teacher and Abel, which is melodramatic and not entirely believable, but the performances are solid, and beautiful -often haunting- scenery as a bonus.",1330819200,2,819,4.857142857142857
2434958,3,B000BPK2KC,"This is a film with beautiful photography. The stark winter with mounds of snow against the bleak dark forests make a startling contrast. I remember that kind of snow from my youth- snow piled so high that it seemed to reach the top of the electric poles. This was filmed in Nova Scotia and has the look of an old New England town.

Abel Grey, played by Edward Burns, is a policeman sent to investigate the death of a boy from a local prep school. The boy was found floating in a river.  One apparent fact at the beginning of the film is that Abel is fairly new at his job, but he has good instinct. His colleague, is a bumbling fool who only wants to have a job, and will do anything to keep their boss happy. He has no ideas how to run an investigation, and makes snap judgements that never pan out. Abel, finds his boss is listening to the school, who suddenly gave the town money for the Police Benevolent Fund. How convenient is that? Abel realizes that he won't get anywhere with this kind of philosophy, and he quits his job. Abel has done his job and has found the boy's girlfriend, Carlin. She tells Abel that the boy was being bullied, and she is certain he would never commit suicide. Abel finds a teacher, played by Jennifer Ehle, who also realizes something is not right, and she lends some expertise and comfort to Abel.

At the same time, Abel Grey is confronting his own issues about the suicide of his brother. This case brings all of the misery and doubt to the fore. Is this case therapeutic for him, many thing not. This is a complex and long film. Some editing could have made this a much better film. Most of us could guess what was going to occur, although there were some surprises. Good acting, of course, by Edward Burns, and this was the first film that recognized the beautiful Jennifer Ehle.

2434959,3,B000BPK2KC,"Please ignore the hateful reviewers. This was an entertaining film. The lead actor was great - and very handsome. The lead actress (high school student) was also quite good.

I didn't give the movie a four because of a few things. 1. The ending seemed to lack direction. 2. The adults and kids at the school were very one-dimensional. 3. Sane characters made rash decisions (don't want to give things away -- but this involves employment and engagement issues). 4. When the main mystery was revealed, it's unclear who exactly was having the flashback! That's the biggest goof.

Nonetheless, this is an entertaining film.",1322870400,,620,4.951923076923077
2434960,3,B000BPK2KC,"I must start by saying I did not read the book on which this film is based so I had no expectation.  The movie is described as a haunting mystery story and I am aware that Hoffman is an excellent writer.  But I must admit I got little that was haunting, mysterious or suspenseful from this film.  A student is discovered dead at an elite school.  Signs point to possible homicide but the school gets the police department to rush things through and rule it as a suicide.  These things do occur in life but the srcript was very poorly written.  All the depth there was came thru the performance of Ed Burns.  He became his character fully and all emotion, atmosphere and message here came thru his perfomance be it his body language or way of speaking.  His performance was the only one of any depth here.  The actions of everyone else at the police department closing the case so abruptly and their comments bordered on inance and ridiculous.  Even with a crime being covered up it would never be done so obviously.

And then we have the casting of Jennifer Ehle who was superb in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  I would honestly like to know why she chose to play the role of the teacher.  The character's actions bordered on ridiculous.  I can go on but this is just a very bad movie.  But if you are a fan of Edward Burns it is worth a look for his superb performance.  I would give this film 1 star if not for his presence.  Often when books are made into movies the adaption comes across poorly.  Seems that was what happened here.  At the end I did get what the purpose of it all was but was just stunned at how poorly it was all executed.",1315180800,,1635,4.284313725490196
2434961,4,B000BPK2KC,"Intensely moving and genuinely profound without the sappiness typical of the Lifetime movie machine and Oxygen Channel retreads.

Explores the truth behind the death, and possible suicide, of a young prep school student. Edward Burns' character is a deputy sheriff who confronts an entrenched establishment, including his own partner, that seems intent on erasing the entire death from local history. No one wants to talk about it - no one, save a single girl who may be experiencing spiritual visitations from the boy she spurned.

Convinced that the victim may have died as part of a secret society's initiation rite, twists and turns abound as the deputy continues to pursue the truth at the cost of everything - job, reputation, friendships, and even his own sense of self.

And this leads him to one of the prep school's instructors, Ms. Betsy Chase, played by Jennifer Ehle. Their growing secret romance plays against the backdrop of institutional denial and supernatural events, culminating in a surprise twist.

On a personal side note I was amazed, intrigued and a bit freaked out by Jennifer Ehle who looks like Meryl Streep's clone in this production. Having seen other images of the actress - this was not an accident. In real life Ms. Ehle does not look like a Streep doppelganger, so clearly someone decided to coax the resemblance for full effect.

Additionally, quite possibly one of the best modern soundtracks I've heard in the last 10 years. I would suggest any filmmaker listen to this film to see how a proper score can and should be applied to their project; how deeply it can affect the sensibility of the audience.

Not necessarily a film I would recommend to those in a deeply emotional situation, as this movie can be easily misunderstood by a person in a vulnerable state.",1299628800,,1799,4.901315789473684
2434962,3,B000BPK2KC,"Alice Hoffman's book was wonderful.  Her skillful blend of the real and the supernatural in this otherwise mundane tale of love, loss and guilt took it out of the realm of the ordinary and made it unforgettable.  Alas, it did not translate well to the screen.  Unlike the movie of Practical Magic, which I thought was better than the book, The River King left me with a sense of a story only hinted at.

Edward Burns was excellent as the detective investigating the apparent suicide of a student at an exclusive boarding school.  The lovely Jennifer Ehle was grossly underused as the teacher who is attracted to Burns' character, but has issues of her own.  Her story was only alluded to, with scenes of her fiance sawing away at his cello while life and death struggles were taking place around him.  The movie might have been more interesting if the primary focus had been on this story.

The cast of this made for TV movie was superb, and the production values excellent.  It's just that the whole thing was well, empty.  While the behavior and suffering of the students was handled and acted very well, the movie left me uneasy, and not in the way a Bergman movie does.  This one just felt unfinished and lacking.

When I finally found the supposed shattering explanations for the deaths ( of Abel's brother and Gus) a two second clip of events, I was so aggravated that I kept interrupting my sleep for NOTHING. I couldn't even think of an ending that boring or stupid if I had a gun to me head. The ending made the disjointed unbelievable never explained annoying story and one dimensional characters actually look good. Even the title makes no sense and has nothing to do with the movie. The whole film is nothing but boring loose ends that never get tied and makes you feel like two hours ( that feels like 12) was robbed from your life. I bought for a dollar and want my money back.

2434964,5,B000BPK2KC,"This was a really good story and it's remained in the back of my mind since I watched it! Edward Burns, in the starring role, gives an outstanding performance as Detective Abel Grey.

The setting is a small New England town where a private prep school seems to be the dominating influcence in the area. When Gus Pierce, a young student is found dead, the questions start!  Did he commit suicide, have an accident or was he murdered? The school officials, the police chief, the boy's best friend, and the boy's father all have their own theories and personal reasons to believe them.  Detective Grey becomes very involved in solving the mystery. His older brother had also died mysteriously when he was a teenager. Grey, a small boy at the time, had never really resolved his personal loss.

A little romance is added to the film when Detective Grey and a teacher at the school meet and seem to have an instant connection. Their relationship provides a little lightness to the film.

I felt that The River King was well done and the filming and music lent a haunting beauty to the scenery. It was a perfect fit!",1213920000,5,1110,4.585858585858586
2434965,4,B000BPK2KC,"For over a century, the small New England town of Haddon has maintained an uneasy relationship with its prestigious prep school. Some of the coldness has been remedied by a huge donation made by the academy for a local health center. So when one of the scholarship students is found face up under the ice of the river, the police and town council are reluctant to investigate when it looks like an accident or suicide. But one cop, Abel Grey, cannot bring himself to sweep ant evidence under the Persian rugs, even when it appears likely that a group of the more elite boys may be behind the death.

Although the movie plot suffers from the absence of detail that illuminated the novel, it conveys an aura of secrecy and menace that is hard to resist. The performances by a relatively little known cast are understated, but what this film lacks in terms of excitement is provided by its visuals, atmosphere, and sometimes its silence. The snowy, icy northeastern winter and the dark, formal buildings are the perfect setting for this story, which is full of symbolism and strongly reminiscent of another movie in this genre, The Dead Poets Society. Schools will always have their misunderstood misfits and their cocky leaders with their followers, and the River King is yet another version of what may happen when they are all required to coexist.",1212969600,4,1347,4.781115879828326

Not living in Canada or the woods of New England it was a beautiful image I don't get to see very often and it got my attention.  The camera then pans over to Ed Burns as he is walking through the woods.  This scene caught my interest but what is more impressive is that the movie was able to keep it throughout even though I had turned on my TV to watch something else.  As other reviewers have said the movie is atmospheric and moody...things I'm usually not that big a fan of unless I'm in that mood myself.  But this movie does it right and does it without being overbearing. Combined with the beautiful cinematography and subtle, nuanced acting this is a very enjoyable movie that will leave you thinking.

Sadly, Hollywood can't seem to make many films that take their time to develop the characters without resorting to violence and special effects.

Edward Burns carries the film and, and finds that he must first resolve troublesome feelings regarding his older brother's death beforee he can know how to resolve the mysterious death of a student at a private school.

2434969,3,B000BPK2KC,"The River King is a passable evening's entertainment that merits a repeat viewing, provided your expectations are limited to one or more of the following: a ""New England-y"" movie with lots of New England-type (in reality, Halifax) snow scenes; remote, elite prep school movies and/or hazing films; murder mystery with vague sense of unease/discord.

Good acting will, however, be in short supply (that's right, I'm here speaking of...well, everyone except the British guy aka Julian Rhind-Hutt). Ditto on contiguous, well-integrated narrative lines and quality sound production (maybe it was the mics, but everyone sounds like they were recorded with a ten-dollar Radio Shack tape recorder).

I've not read The River King, but I have read two or three other Hoffman novels. She is not, for me, the best of contemporary writers, but she comes up with interesting stories with strong senses of place/setting (usually New England) and her polished style is rich in metaphor
and a northern (Anglo) version of magical-realism. Having read other of her works (and seen the very silly but fairly entertaining Practical Magic), I can say that her work appears difficult to translate to film. Here, for example, the tadpoles trope (which screams ""Hoffman magical realism alert"") was quite foolishly played with an emphasis on the realism rather than the magic.

Yet despite the expected pitfalls of Hoffman adaptation, the filmmakers could have done a better job with this project, perhaps by excising the face-in-the-photographs theme, which misleadingly promises a supernatural storyline. The only ghosts in this movie are psychological.

Ed Burns looks too much like Sean Hayes (""Will & Grace"")for me to take him seriously as a self-contained, troubled cop. Plus, his reading of some of his lines causes me to seriously question how he ever made it big in movies. British actor Jamie King plays bad boyfriend Harry, and his lousy American accent mirrors his acting skills. Quebec-born Rachelle LeFevre is passable as the grieving best friend Carlin, and her lovely mane of red-gold curls distracts us enough that we don't really notice any faltering steps.

Half British-half American Jennifer Ehle pulls out the rusty American accent of her youth (it has been asserted she can slip in and out of equally perfect Yank and Brit accents at will), although Yank is in fact a misnomer; she ""cayn't"" help but speak in an odd corruption of her native North Carolinian twang.

The score is solid and offers and appropriate feeling of discord, with the best work--on what sounds like a mandolin or dulcimer--over the credits.

If you are interested primarily in ""atmosphere"" of the sort that suggests everyone is hiding a secret, and if you can tolerate uneven acting and a few poor accents, by all means, pick up the River King. Mostly, you will enjoy this provided your expectations are not high, especially due to the big-name actors.

I've watched it twice now and will likely pop it in again on a rainy Sunday when I am avoiding housework. Here's hoping you can find an equally good use for it.",1168732800,5,3085,5.071005917159764
2434970,2,B000BPK2KC,"A murder mystery at an elite school, wrapped in the silent chill of a snowy winter. Why not? Well, ""The River King"" shows that a movie needs a coherent plot as well as a unique style, but it belly flops painfully with its uninspiring acting, meandering storyline, and an ending that completely bombs.

Student Gus Pierce (Thomas Gibson) is found frozen in the river. Cop Abel Grey (Edward Burns) investigates the elite prep school that Gus attended, trying to find out if it was an accident, suicide, or murder -- any of them is possible, since Gus was quite angry. Abel also finds time to romance a teacher at the school (Jennifer Ehle).

But the mystery of Gus's death is that no one seems to care -- his classmates despised him, and the police drop the case without warning, despite signs of foul play. But with his personal demons emerging, Abel continues investigating the case, suspecting it of being a hazing gone wrong -- and discovers that he may have been wrong all along.

But if you must adjust a book's plot for a movie, then at least it should make sense. And for seventy-five percent of ""River King,"" the plot seems like a straightforward murder mystery, framed in beautiful New England houses, snow, icy rivers and sleeping trees. Okay, the actual investigations could be covered in fifteen minutes rather than an hour, but it's all right.

Then... it all comes apart. Burns and Ehle's relationship feels thrown in (does obsession let you have breaks for romance?). Director Nick Willing and writer David Kane try to make this a jack-of-all-trades film, with the token romance, ghost stories, murder mystery, and a creepy philosophical high school club. Most of these subplots are touched on just long enough to make them seem bizarre, but not enough to make them a part of the movie.

And the finale makes no sense -- after dozens of clues, sinister coverups, and glaringly obvious murder, Willing and Kane decide to throw a ""shocking twist"" into the finale. Except it's not a twist -- suddenly the whole lone-wolf murder mystery becomes a catalyst for Abel's family problems. It's a MASSIVE anticlimax that feels like a sandbag whack in the face. Viewers are left with nothing. At all.

Burns does what he can with his role, even though Abel is somnolent at best. The only scenes where he gets to show what he can do is when Abel is angry. And he has zero chemistry with Jennifer Ehle, who does a nice job despite a paper-thin character and bad wig. Rachelle Lefevre is the only actress who gets to play a character of any dimensions -- the slightly off galpal of Gus'.

""The River King"" had so much promise, but it bogs down in its glacial plot and absurdist ending. Even Ehle and Burns can't save this soggy, cold little mess.",1168732800,7,2746,4.6728778467908905
2434971,5,B000BPK2KC,"Gorgeously brooding cinematography, brilliant and perfectly chosen cast and a deeply emotive score characterize this melancholy reflection on the death of a young man and the ripples it has on the lives of a cop, a teacher and a close friend.  Easily one of the best films of 2005 that sadly fell under the radar.  This is one of those rare gems that real film lovers will discover in the years to come and hold up as an example of what a great movie can really be.

Sadly now you're stuck with reviews on Amazon.com from 3 camps:

1) The book purists who decry any derivation from the original source material and refuse to look at the film apart from the novel (a complaint that's understood but unjustified and unfair when judging a film on its own merits);

2) Moronic, tasteless idiots (usually younger viewers but not necessarily) who lack a brain, a heart and any measure of patience for anything that doesn't involve slick antiheroes, fast-paced violence and debasing sex;

3) Fans of the material who like what they've seen but struggle to properly synopsize or understand it due to the film's subtleties and metaphoric nature.  I'll put myself in this latter category as I think the film is best experienced than read about, but as there are so many dim-witted responses to this film, I might as well try my own dim-witted attempt to explain what is so incredible about this picture.

I won't go into the plot, save to say that it begins with the discovery of a body in a river and the investigation by an honest police officer (played by Burns) who starts to see evidence that more is involved than an accident.

The three leads are very real, tragic characters that belong to the town's icy wasteland which has become infused with the mysterious death that in each of their lives takes on almost mythological proportions.

Burns is absolutely perfect in the role of a cop whose grief for his long dead brother is triggered by the investigation and possible cover-up.  Unspoken and stoic, the grief is all in his achingly haunted eyes; like the small town blanketed in winter the character is frozen by sorrow, unable to move forward in his life.

Burns is joined by the ever wonderful Jennifer Ehle (Pride & Prejudice), a teacher in the school where the boy attended, who in her own way becomes obsessed by the tragedy of the case.  Unlike Burns, Ehle is frozen not by the past, but by the future -- engaged to a man that is utterly void and cold -- yet unable to see a way out for herself.

Lastly there is the dead boy's friend played by Rachelle Lefevre, a young woman traumatized by the possibility that her friend may have committed suicide due to a fight she had with him shortly prior to his death.  Unable to cope with the part she may have played, she becomes a stark figure of grief stuck in the icy landscape of a terrible moment.

Part of what makes this film so powerful and refreshing is it's deft use of music, camera and subtle metaphoric elements to create a deeply moody palette that approaches myth, yet remains utterly real and hauntingly reflective without falling into the cliched supernatural thriller mold.  Likewise, while utilizing some of the trappings of mystery and cop films, it never descends into the cliche of the violent police film, nor the mystery movie that presents twists just for the sake of fooling the audience.

This film works at a much higher level than all of that.  Yet despite its metaphysical elements, it's never pretentious or ungrounded in real life, even if at times that reality is heightened.  There is a rare emotive quality here that weaves a spell akin to what great literature is able to achieve, creating genuine mystery and keeping the reality of the plot from ever feeling altogether depressing (which some feel while reading a newspaper for example.)  It's aptly named The River King as there are layers of depth that will have you returning to the film and even picking up the original novel by Alice Hoffman.  Sadly, the only thing lacking is any kind of extras on the DVD (save the trailer which is terribly cut to make the film look like something else.)  A future release with director's and actors' commentary, an interview with Alice Hoffman, deleted scenes and other added bonuses would be great!  That said, the 16x9 transfer is incredibly life-like and detailed.  The 5.1 sound makes good use of the surrounds where appropriate to create and sustain the film's stark atmosphere.

Without revealing anything, I think where some people find themselves disappointed in the film (apart from the simpleminded buffoons who demand Hollywood cliches and can't handle something different) is that the River King takes the viewer on a journey that shows us glimpses of an elusive heightened sense of reality, but brings us back to the surface of the real world.  And it is a grievous world.  And yet as in the image of spring and the flowing water, lives become unthawed, and the story is redeemed from being too unremittingly grim.  Not every mystery is solved, and not everything is perfectly tied up.  Nor should it be.  That's not how life is.  And the river keeps its own secrets.

If nothing else I've said makes any sense, trust me when I say this: If you appreciate a movie that actually makes you feel something, and doesn't have to provide pat answers and false thrills, pick up The River King.",1167868800,60,5379,4.688297872340425
2434972,3,B000BPK2KC,"This is a thoughtful, well-made film but its problem is that the ending leaves the viewer disappointed and let-down. It poses a number of interesting, possible answers to the death of a young man, yet the ""truth"" of that death leaves both the viewer and the hero of the story feeling that we have wasted our time in trying to make sense of it. This film has the saving grace of Jennifer Ehle, whose beauty and grace shine far beyond her role. There is something magical about this actress and the film is worth seeing if only to watch her. Another of her films, ""Possession,"" is similarly lit by her performance.",1156377600,4,612,4.5225225225225225
2434973,3,B000BPK2KC,"This movie has a lot going for it: good actors (Jennifer Ehle is fantastic), good cinematography, and good music.  So why was I dissatisfied when the movie ended.  Let me count the ways while trying not to reveal the (surprise?) ending: plot lines never resolved, e.g. smudged photos; silly scenes such as the girlfriend shearing off her beautiful long hair and swimming down a river (usually she uses the much cleaner school pool) to no purpose except somehow to bond with her dead non-lover who drowned in that very same river; trite scene in which good cop (Edward Burns) turns in his badge and gun (don't all good movie cops do this sooner or later?); previously secret lovers openly smooching with muted reckless abandon at a very public school gathering; mood music growing toward a climax that seems only to be signaled by the credits.
After watching the movie I discovered that it was based a book by Alice Hoffman, author of the execrable ""Here on Earth""  (see my review ""Morbid, Depressing & Pointless."")  Since Ms. Hoffman doesn't burden herself with such niceties as character development and motivation, this movie is right in synch with her style.  The secret to enjoying The River King is to allow yourself to drift along with the moods and enjoy the wintry cinematography without thinking or expecting too much.",1155859200,2,1327,4.88
2434974,3,B000BPK2KC,"This $16 million adaptation of Alice Hoffman's haunting suspense novel The River King isn't nearly as good as some reviews here indicate - or nearly as bad either, for that matter - instead, falling somewhere squarely in the middle.

The story begins quickly enough, with the discovery of a body, drowned and frozen in the Haddan River. The body is that of a student named August ""Gus"" Pierce: a misfit attending The Haddan School, a prestigious, New England prep school founded in 1858. A pair of the local-yokel police pull the body out of the water, and when a strange red rash spreads across the blue-white flesh of the corpse, officer Abel Grey (Edward Burns) intuitively decides the death might not be just a simple suicide; and despite the reprimands of his partner and police chief, begins an obsessive investigation into a possible student hazing gone deadly wrong.

The strength in this title comes from the suitably moody direction by Nick Willing (1997's Photographing Fairies), and heightened by the haunting score by composer Simon Boswell and some amazing cinematography by Paul Sarossy.

The film meanders though, as director Willing takes plenty of time to work his way through the screenplay, strenuously adapted from Hoffman's wordy novel by writer David Kane. The film has a 99 minute running time, but feels like it runs twice that long. The slow pace is the film's fatal mistake, faltering because of a mediocre, mostly unknown cast. Led by the bland Burns as officer Grey (and who hasn't had a hit in years, but is - unfortunately - the most compelling character here), the cast grapples with the mystic nature of the story, but mostly comes across sounding ridiculously pretentious.

This is one of those oddities that feels like it should've been a bigger, hyped studio release, a-la Clint Eastwood's over-rated Mystic River (also adapted from a much better novel); as if it got the green light by some suit at First Look Pictures, but fell somewhat short of the exec's lofty expectations. Or, considering the size of the studio backing the project, maybe the end result is as good as could be expected.",1154822400,,2128,4.919220055710307
2434975,1,B000BPK2KC,"I was pleasantly surprised when I found that The River King, one of my favorite Alice Hoffman books, had been made into a movie.  Honestly, I did not have my hopes up though.  It just came out in 2005 & I'd heard nothing about it.  I bought it anyway.  Big mistake!  It was terrible.  The basic plot follows the book, but that's the only recognizable element of the extraordinary novel.  Hoffman's writing is elegant & descriptive.  The natural world intrudes on the man-made one.  There are legends of the past that come to play on current events.  None of this was included.  More than once, I felt that simple voice-over could have helped to enhance the film and include all of the internal activites.  And I'm not generally a fan of voice overs.  I generally like Ed Burns, but he was miscast in this role.  In fact, all of the major roles were miscast.  If you're as curious as I was and are a fan of Hoffman, rent the movie before you buy.",1148947200,2,945,4.381502890173411
2434976,5,B000BPK2KC,"Intrigued by the title and its mythical associations, I rented this film on impulse.  Although I have never warmed to Alice Hoffman's novels, after watching ""The River King,"" twice, I was tempted to try reading one again.

  Given the slow pace, the bleak winter setting and the flat affect of the character played by Ed Burns, I sat back expecting a competently acted, routine murder mystery. But ""The River King"" is anything but typical or ordinary.

  As with any mystery, there is the suspicious death, secrets and lies, plot twists and the resulting revelations. However, side by side with the visible and palpable world we call reality is another world, symbolized by the ubiquitous river, that intersects with the lives and fates of the characters. The story provides a satisfying end; but just as the river seems to flow unendingly, so the viewer will continue thinking about the River King.

  In ""The River King,"" Ed Burns conveys an understated intensity and passion, as does Jennifer Ehle, which requires few words.  The silences between them express far more than any words they do exchange. The supporting cast is strong and convincing in their roles.  Then there's the music, which beguiles and captivates, leaving the listener longing for more.

2434979,3,B000BPK2KC,"I was pleasantly surprised by this flick.  What seemed like a clear-cut police flick/detective story, turned out to be a tad more.  In some movies that go out of their way to give you a plot twist here and there, and everywhere...this one stayed low key. Or even worse, some movies take a situation and make it a ""supernatural"" event to solve a plot problem... I won't say what happened in 'The River King', but my words will make more sense after you have seen it.  This is not a hollywood block-buster.  No huge special effects, no gonzo explosions, car chases or driving war scenes.  A very small piece set in a small town, with lots of snow.  I felt the overall movie dragged a little longer than necessary... you could chop off about 20 minutes of this and still get the same feel and result.  That said, If you aren't patient, or have the attention span of a gnat, rent or watch something else.  Overall the acting and performances were fair, execution was fair as well... Nothing Oscar winning. 3 stars.  Overachieving small film, decent story, long on execution.",1145145600,3,1070,4.589473684210526

I agree with the reveiwer who lamented the waste of Ed Burns's talents; otherwise, the movie is dreadfully predictable, stonily acted and unsatisfying. It's a shame, in a way, because a better film seems to be hiding behind this narrow execution. The actress playing Carlin is simply too old for her role, and her character, who seems so pivotal, is given short shrift (perhaps she ended up on the cutting room floor).  The scenes between Burns's character, Grey, and his father are just too much psychobabble for words, and the stunted ""romance"" between Grey and the Lit teacher (a wooden performance at best) is lacking in sparks.  No wonder I never herad of this film when it was released (or not, as one reviewer here indicates). Very disappointing.",1145059200,3,812,4.792857142857143

This is not a fast paced in your face shootem up as perhaps some people need a fix for action. However, it is a good movie that although occasionally convaluted still delivers a good story. Good acting, sets, and music make this a worthy rental and I even intend to buy it as I think it is very rewatchable. Burns does a fine job and the rest the cast are more than competant. The camera work is excellent and the director does a great job of making us feel haunted. Many will in fact feel deja vu as one reviewer mentioned. Perhaps from your university days, perhaps from somewhere else. Fans of mysteries should enjoy it. Especially those that enjoy the ""Stone Cold"" style and not just ""Die Hard"".

To be short and to the point, this movie absolutely sucks.  The storytelling is horrid and there's no way the book can be any worse.  The acting throughout the movie is pretty subpar and the director does a horrid job at tying everything together.  The ending was very anticlimactic and certainly unsatisfying.  I'd go into greater depth, but this movie was just so bad that I can't even find the words to describe it.
