8523421,3,B00486UTCQ,"Just FYI, this film is made by and stars unpaid volunteers. The producer Doug Phillips usually writes and stars in his movies also.

This film follows a police plain clothes detective as he investigates a crib death after the mother had discovered the dead baby and called nine-one-one in her surprised state. The case is almost dropped, when the autopsy  ends up showing suspicious evidence, a natural crib death was ruled out, and the mystery begins.

This wasn't a bad film. Interesting story too. I would hve liked to see the end of the mystery stretched out more.
I personally would have ended it after the mystery is solved, but a happy ending is always a nice way to end a movie. Could have used a bit more relationship developing though. It seemed added in at the last moment.

Who I would recommend this film to:
This film is wonderful for beginning film artists and actors. Great research material for what angles work and don't work, how to get scenes to flow, and for actors to learn what the camera ""likes"" so as to not rely on editing in their acting (as many do). It is pretty well done for being 100% volunteer work, and I am told most of the Doug Phillips films are made, start to finish, in only one weekend!
