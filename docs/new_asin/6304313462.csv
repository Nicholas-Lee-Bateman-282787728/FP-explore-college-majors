Which is not surprising because many of the actual artists interviewed come  from the localities near the Songhai Kingdon of Mali. However the focus of  the documentary is on pre Islamic and pre Christian artifacts made for  ritualistic purposes in animistic religious ceremonies.  The documentary  attempts to cover a lot of ground both by discussing the use of the very  word ""art"" to describe objects in  cultures in which the term  does not exist. As well as the absence of the maxim ""art for art  sake"" in which many western  artist produce art for the sole purpose  of self expression.  Thus suggesting that in Africa there is only  ""functional art"" rather than decorative art.  This we are  informed is due to the fact that West African art adheres to rigid artistic  traditions that alter only in their reflection of what historically has  changed not in the manner in which they are made. If you believe that  Africans never produce decorative art for themselves and only for the  tourist industry then this will sit well with you.
There are also a  number of interviews with African-American and British anthropologists and  ethnographers regarding the legacy of colonial interpretations by western  artists like Picasso. The documentary discuses the 19th Century emphasis on  seeking the ""noble savage"" and the so called unchanging  primitivism inherent in African artifacts. This is said to have created a  barrier to westerners seeing African art how Africans see it and ultimately  why the object was made in the first place. This again could be considered  a contentious and presumptuous comment but it is also obvious that for many  centuries African art has been considered inferior to western art and this  has been enormously damaging to African culture as whole. Not enough actual  art is shown from other countries in Africa , no women artists are  interviewed and there are no close ups of the masks used in ceremonial  dances. However an animist observent is shown at his shrine making an  offering and the sound and visual quality of the film are superb and the  people interviewed obviously passionate about art in general. This is a  good introduction for people already fascinated by African art but is too  intellectual for children.",949104000,24,2411,5.0
