Though the instructor moves along quick it is easy to go back and see what exactly he did. His lessons are valuable on camera angles, camera positioning, and how to evoke certain emotions in your shots. I fully recommend this dvd!",1260230400,,389,4.571428571428571
8295837,2,B001E0O8DU,"This software loaded then froze up on my laptop, was unusable beyond opening greeting video. Got it to run on desktop PC. I find this DVD to be not very useful, very little pedagogy-- this is nothing more than about six short videos progressively showing the author rapidly (so fast you barely have time to see what he is doing with Adobe Photoshop) sketching a sequence of sketches about an 'eggsucker' toadlike creature sneaking up on an egg (dinner). This software DVD should be selling for more like $14.95 if that. Seems to be more of a promo for the author's services and website, very very little actual tutorial pedagogy / instruction. I am going to see if I can return this.

Also, annoying, is when the software loads, it takes up the screen in such a way that there is NO titlebar and thus NO way to minimize the program, NO way to move it around the desktop/screen-- annoying.

But also note I tried to run it on a powerful Toshiba laptop, 4GB, MS Vista, and it froze up and would not play anything beyond the greeting video. This software seems to have very heavy anti-piracy encryption and such and I suspect that might be part of the reason for the buggyness. Because I explored the DVD figuring I would just look for the individual Quicktime videos and they are not visible, thus I had to rely on the program's interface which as I said is very buggy and freezes up on my laptop, and Ctrl+Alt+Del on MS Windows did not even allow me to 'End Program'.

But in summary, VERY LITTLE instruction. I paid way too much just to watch the author do his sketches rather than talk me through illustration principles and storyboarding techniques that I have WAY BETTER instruction on in several BOOKS about storyboarding that I own.",1259971200,3,1737,4.560897435897436
