8226497,5,B000X1L8NE,"I accidentally found this dvd on amazon, while I was searching for an old  Southern Rock band, with the name of Sea Level. When I got this, I did a ""Wickapedia"", look-up of Fred Eaglesmith. They described him as being Alternative Country, and that Fred is a Canadian. After watching this dvd, it seemed to me, that this band was from the South. They played kind of like Southern Rock Bands, and Fred seemed to have a ""southern accent"". Anyway, I would describe the music as a cross between Southern Rock & Alternative Country, even though they are Canadians. I was really pleased with the concert. I found it to be a fun & enjoyable concert.

13. The Dad Song

At Spijkerboor:
