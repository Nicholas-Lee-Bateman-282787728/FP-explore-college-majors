Some casual, some cozy, some charged with tension and for sure exotic. Shu Qi makes the movie worth a watch indeed. She is quite good in this one. The other performers do a splendid job too. I've long been interested in Taiwan so I'm given to favoring such movies. Having watched many Asian movies I can connect to the story. I rented this video. I may decide to buy a copy for myself. Mabey I'll buy a second copy to send to a friend. Best enjoyed while eating instant noodles with chopsticks! Smile!",1111881600,3,654,4.413223140495868
2078921,3,B0002DB5MC,"I gave it 3 stars because the cinematography is beautiful as photography.

Also if you suffer from insomnia, get this.  I tried to watch it 3 times 3 evenings in a row and had to go to bed before I finally finished it the 4th afternoon.

The slowest paced movie I have EVER seen.

It makes ""Lost in Translation"" seem Action-Packed.

The score is similar to ""Lost in Translation.""  Could switch them and not tell the difference.  But ""Lost in Translation"" has a lot more going on.

I don't know exactly what happened in this movie.  The girl, Vicki, is very beautiful.  She has a boyfriend who is mean to her.  She leaves him and Jack, a Yakuza type, takes care of her.  What happens, I'm just not sure.

I watched the extended scene that was availabe in the Special Features and that didn't help clarify much.

Everybody is beautiful to look at and nothing shocking happens.  The snow landscapes are lovely.",1107302400,11,907,4.512345679012346
2078922,1,B0002DB5MC,"The movie is described as a beautiful and honest look at young people living in Taipei around the year 2000. Well, with that said, I was expecting an interesting movie about young people living in Taipei around the year 2000. I guess I was expecting too much. The movie actually started out pretty well. The first few scenes I thought were fascinating, but after that the movie really just falls apart. Seriously. This really is the worst movie ever. It has to be. Was this movie even taking place in Taipei? The entire film takes place in something like three clubs and three apartments. No one was ever outside or in the streets. This film could easily have been taking place in Irvine or even Idaho! We can't tell!

The pace of the movie is excruciatingly slow. The fact that the story progresses in fragments doesn't help much either. The story is flat and the characters are empty. They are just drug abusers you really don't care about. What I hated most was when the narrator would tell us what happened in the past, and then the film does a flashback to show us exactly what the narrator just told us. If you are going to tell us what happens, why do you have to show us? Skip it and move on to the next scene, please! And what is with everyone saying this movie is beautiful? This movie was so extremely difficult to watch I couldn't even finish it! It wasn't going anywhere. The girl, Shu Qi has a boyfriend who does drugs and abuses her but she can't leave him. That's it. That's the whole movie. Oh no! Did I spoil it for you?

Along with being extremely dull and slow, the camera work was a ridiculously pathetic attempt at who knows what! The girl and her boyfriend would be in their apartment and the ONE camera would just stay in place. If they were in another room, well the audience wouldn't be with them because the camera would be stuck staring at the kitchen counter. The camera would move sometimes, but when it did, it looks like the director woke up and said, ""hey everybody, we're filming! wake up!"" I think the director should have rented Hitchcock's ""The Rope"" for technical reference. Heck, even Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"" would have helped. I don't know how much money this movie cost to make, but it is pretty clear that everyone involved got robbed-- Especially me. Stay clear of this horrible mess.",1104364800,7,2326,4.509478672985782

2078925,3,B0002DB5MC,"This movie was going nowhere, movie was like a mute, the characters sat around alot at home smoking and drinking alcohol. Vicky is always smoking or lighting up a cigerette. It was dreadful to see them do the same thing over and over again.",1092873600,5,240,4.4772727272727275
2078946,3,B0002DB5MC,"In the neon-saturated city of Taipei lives a young woman named Vicky. She is living with her boyfriend Hao, but he isn't working now and moreover, is a very jealous guy. Vicky is also attracted to Jack, a man living in underworld and running a night club.

Acclaimed Taiwanese director Hsiao-hsien Hou's film is all about Vicky played by Qi Shu, but ""Millennium Mambo"" is nothing like eventful ""Transporter."" In short, nothing ""big"" happens here. So if you happen to read Vicky's story and expect something dramatic and romantic in ""Millennium Mambo,"" probably you will be disappointed.

Not that the film is total failure. On the contrary, this quiet film, which employs such techniques as long, continuous shots or non-linear timeline, is what exactly we should expect from the director of ""A City of Sadness."" The difference is ""Millennium Mambo"" does not deal with Taiwanese history, but modern life of young people of the land represented by Vicky. Whereas in ""A City of Sadness"" one historical incident plays a key role, in ""Mambo"" the life of Vicky has nothing to say, or suggest, except ... Vicky, who is not particularly interesting presence per se as she embodies what the young generation of Taiwan is all about, according to the director.

Some would think naturally that the film is tedious and boring. After all, the director is not interested in Vicky's story itself. Curiously Vicky herself tells the story of herself, looking back from ten years after the events described in the film. The strange voiceover makes Vicky all the more detached from us, making herself part of the scenes of everyday life in Taipei.

And probably this is what Hsiao-hsien Hou intended. He is always good at capturing the atmosphere, or air of the places where the characters are living, and in this he does not disappoint. He also successfully makes a great contrast between the stifling rooms in Taipei and the chilling, snowy landscapes in Yubari, Japan, where Vicky looks most cheerful and lively. (This film was really shot during the film festival in Yubari City, in February, 2001, and the old lady working at the Japanese bar was really running the place.)

For all these merits, I couldn't bring myself to like this film because, in spite of the visually stunning cinematography, it is hard to keep watching the life of someone depicted in an emotionally detached fashion. Hsiao-hsien Hou's touch is not cold, rather compassionate in his own way when showing Vicky and Hao, but once we realize what he is trying to, we are to keep watching him making the same point over and over again for the rest of film.",1181952000,2,2612,4.860674157303371
2078947,4,B0002DB5MC,"""Millennium Mambo"", directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien, is not a movie for everyone. The reason why I say that is pretty simple, as not much happens, and the story is somehow slow, unless you get caught up in what is happening to the main character. I did, and that is the reason why I enjoyed this dvd...

The main character of this film is Vicky (Shu Qi), and ""Millennium Mambo"" is just a way to allow her to tell her story, in her words, from a very subjective point of view. Vicky is an extremely beautiful young woman that lives in Taiwan and doesn't have a clue regarding what to do with her life. But is that her fault, or is that loss of direction something that has to do with the spirit of our time? And why does she make us care?

I should point out that this movie doesn't end neatly, so those who only like that kind of ending won't find it here. ""Millennium Mambo"" is open-ended, in more or less the same way that Vicky's own story is in the process of changing and doesn't have real fixed limits. I find that fitting, at least for this movie, and I think that you will deem it appropriate too. Recommended!

PS: I give this movie 3.5 stars out of 5 :)",1181001600,4,1187,4.170305676855895
2078948,3,B0002DB5MC,"Shu Qi looks dear and is fortunately in nearly every scene. I would say that this character must have been written for her.  There are many girls attractive and desirable but with no power in the economic tiger that is Taiwan.  I sense no culture where girls carry a sense of their innate worth.  Anywhere else, she would have developed into a chic but colder type but on Taiwan island, she is sweet and somehow dowdy in cheapened trendy attire despite her gamine skeleton.  It's not that women in Taiwan are weak but they seem to be undervalued.  That's the only reason I can see for the posturing and presumptuousness of her immature BF.  Her tolerance and accommodation have  nothing to do with any superiority of the male or the benefits of his chivalry and protection.  I found myself boggled by the behavior of the deadweight in this movie and the defeated corrupted version of machismo of his competitor.  Kick them to the curb and get a job at a Club Med.

This world seems shallow in a cultural way that predates consumerism.  It's like something got erased perhaps by choice and this creeping disaster is  the result.  These small problems created for themselves ufortunately equal heart break but there's no way these people can explain that about themselves because they don't believe in their own honesty.  They don't have the ability to communicate sincerity to themselves nevermind seek help outside of their situation.  These people are in trouble but they can't say so. It's not just the Taiwanese accent but the Taiwanese phrasing and vocabulary choices that seems to be about affectation but also denial of any meaning.  There's no truth telling in the words used for injury.  All these arguments and struggles that aren't really expressing the problem.  I think this is big trouble if this is not uncommon.

This movie gave me the shivers several times.",1172793600,,1873,4.815047021943574
2078949,3,B0002DB5MC,"Interesting come to mind.  Beautiful comes to mind.  Great acting comes to mind.  Artful comes to mind.  Great plot does not come to mind, nor does meaningful.  That is the major problem with this film about a girl who basically does nothing but smoke and drink.  I would say Shu Qi is a truly great actress and amazing beauty.  Too bad her talent is wasted on a film with literally no plot.  This film, like many other films of its kind, tries to fool you with pretty packaging and serious problems to devert your attenchion away from the fact that their is zero meaning in the movie.  no lession, no feelings, no reflection.  Nothing.  Its a little like a painting i suppose.  its beautiful, but it stands still and motionless.  You can only stare at a beautful painting for so long before you want to stare at something else, and you can only watch this movie for so long before you want to watch something just as pretty but emotional.",1150934400,4,939,4.452941176470588
2078950,2,B0002DB5MC,"It's hard to review Millennium Mambo and explain the disappointment it gave you. It truly feels like your watching a surveillance tape of some girl and her troubles that don't appear to be that bad due to the lack emotion and feeling that the story is full of . It's so slow and like another reviewer said it does takes you days to force yourself to watch it. The first ten minutes of partying and pacing from the characters make you want to find something else to do. There's no real plot or conflict in the film to make it a story and by the end of it you just wasted your time. There literally is no excitement or any emotion to make you feel it so all that stuff on the DVD case like the words Deeply Moving is a lie. I don't think it was the acting but more the directing and story were too dry, trust me when say it's not worth watching even once.",1145664000,2,853,4.083333333333333
2078951,4,B0002DB5MC,"Directed by Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsien, Millenium Mambo is a compelling portrait of anomie in modern day Taiwan. The lead female, Vicky, played by actress Shu Qi, is seen endlessly lighting cigarettes which quickly comes to represent her lack of direction, her uncertainty about her life. She basically does not know what to do so to substitute something halfway ""concrete"" for this lack of direction, she lights a cigarette.

In addition, as is true for Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Barren Illusion (not available domestically on VHS or DVD), the director peppers the film with references to Western culture that have pervaded the culture of Taiwan; the implication is that this counts in large part for Vicky's alienation and, by extension, that of her friends who are also bar girls and also that of her boyfriend, Hao Hao.

Hsien uses time splicing to tell his story and this is a subtle use indeed. We see a back and forth of events, some of which Vicky narrates in voiceover, some of which she does not. She goes to Japan to find her new boyfriend Jack after she breaks up with Hao Hao; Jack is a gangster, another oblique reference to Western culture that has corrupted, or at least changed Taiwanese culture. But she also goes there to find two brothers, whose names escape me at the moment, who are half Japanese and half Taiwanese. While there, the camera languidly passes by a long series of posters illlustrating movies both Western and Asian alike. This is Hsien's way, no doubt, of indicating the context of this film itself; it is, after all, only a movie. Or maybe it is, more than anything else, a movie. Who can tell?

Hsien is known for his seemingly ambling, plotless style, and this film is no exception. But here he subtly manages to get Vicky's psyche to burrow under our skins, and the effect is, as many have said, hypnotic. This is as well underscored by the ceaseless techno music, an aspect of the film about which Hsien comments in the interesting interview that comprises one of the special features on the disk.

Hsien's style lends itself, more than anything else, to an intensely subjective view of what he is trying to accomplish with his film(s). For me, this was far more compelling than Goodbye South, Goodbye, a film in which the actor who plays Jack in Millenium Mambo, Jack Kao, also plays a gangster. But here in Millenium Mambo, Hsien wisely focuses instead on a young woman whose emotional isolation, whose anomie, resonates far more fully and deeply throughout the film than was true in Goodbye, South, Goodbye.

There is a gradual momentum that build in Millenium Mambo and it is, I feel, truly intriguing.

Highly recommended.",1137888000,23,2665,4.79520697167756

And then one day, unexpectedly, a movie like Millennium Mambo appears. And it restores your faith in movies.

2078954,2,B0002DB5MC,"This movie got some rave reviews from film critics when it was first shown here in New York. As a result, I began watching the DVD with high expectations, and, boy, what a letdown!

I found the film hard to follow.  There isn't much dialogue and it is often hard to tell what's really going on.  The film is about a young woman named Vicki who smokes cigarettes, smokes cigarettes, and then smokes more cigarettes.  Besides smoking cigarettes, she lives with a real loser who is unemployed, smokes dope, and abuses her. (He looks a bit like an Oriental Christopher Walken.) But, you see, every time she leaves him, he finds her and begs her to come back, and, instead of telling him to take a flying you know what, she...goes back to him! In between her live ins with the loser boyfriend, the film almost becomes interesting for a brief moment when she ends up dating a member of a Triad who perhaps (it is unclear but implied) kills someone and flees to Japan.

Because of the lack of dialogue, there is no character development and so it is difficult to care about the characters in the film.  Vicki ends up seeming to be quite a pathetic creature - albeit a fairly sexy pathetic creature.

I thought there at least might be some interesting sex scenes, since Vicki is played by former soft core porn star Shu Qi, but you can forget about that.

All in all, the film is a real snore.  I'm giving it two stars instead of one, however, because of the artful cinematography, and because Shu Qi looks really sexy with all those cigarettes hanging out of her pouting lips.  As another reviewer noted, the film has style but almost no substance.  This film artfully states nothing in particular.",1115856000,6,1691,4.529605263157895
2078955,1,B0002DB5MC,"The plot has the potential of a great movie-whereas Vicki (main character) lives an aimless life filled with superficial pleasures of booze, sex and sounds/sights of the night club. She sticks with her boyfriend who uses and abuses her only because he is familar with him (imprisons herself); later meets a middle aged, seemingly stable guy, but treats her as something platonic rather than passionate. Ironically he invites her to Japan--but only to find he is not there-and she once again goes around the city aimlessly. I GUESS the point is you can't depend on anybody for fulfillment and stability except yourself. But the movie is sooo incredibly slowwww and boring it made me fall asleep several times. I had a very hard time staying awake because of the terrible boring script and non-imaginative manner the plot is handled. A great plot, but a terrible BORING movie-it was a very boring script.

Once again the professional critics RAVED about this movie, which makes me highly suspicious of what those professional critics say. Once again a supposedly ""great"" movie having won prizes--has been for me an endlessly DREARLY experience. I'm glad I rented this movie.

8026594,5,B0002DB5MC,"A girl is advancing graciously along a walkaway, giving sometimes the impression of floating; she's talking presumably about herself, but at the third person. Or is it about another girl? She's saying that the story has happened ten years ago, in 2001. It's about an abusive boyfriend and about her dependence on him, but her tone is detached, and she's smiling. Are we really in 2011 in this scene? Or the girl from 2001 is imagining her future (Millennium Mambo was made actually in 2001)? As she is advancing, the walkaway becomes a tunnel going down: is it a metaphor for the road that life follows toward the end? The whole scene seems surreal, sending subtle signals: maybe the story in the movie is just symbolic, like in a medieval morality.

Actually the walkaway exists in reality. It is in Keelung, a city on the border of the ocean. The girl exists also in reality, and she is from that city, too. One evening, in a bar in Taipei, she told Hou Hsiao-Hsien her story, talking about herself at the third person, and with the same detachment as the personage from the movie.

Why did she tell her story to the filmmaker? I think because Hou Hsiao-Hsien is a good listener, and people feel confidence and sympathy in good listeners. The movies of Hou Hsiao-Hsien show a particular respect and empathy for people like Vicky, and Hao-Hao, and Jack: young people floating freely over the borders of promiscuity, guys good of nothing, bar girls, small thieves, petty gangsters.

The plot could be told in just a couple of sentences: a teenage girl (Vicky) is trying to break with her abusive boyfriend (Hao-Hao), only she always comes back to him; it's like a spell; she needs a job as he doesn't work; she becomes a stripper in a bar where a small gangster (Jack) offers her protection; will the new relation evolve beyond camaraderie? will she rather come back once more to Hao-Hao?

There are three great masters here: Hou Hsiao-Hsien, the filmmaker, Chu Tien-Wen, the author of the screenplay, and Lee Ping-Bing, the cinematographer. Each scene of Millennium Mambo carries some kind of magic and seems unreal: it comes in a halo of blue tones; people and objects are taking shape, to repeat the same basic action; he is abusive, she is submissive, again and again. Taipei: a city of young people, populating the night bars, living the rhythms of techno music, sleeping during the day.

As the movie is developing slowly on the screen, you are looking for a sense in all that. The action is not linear and some scenes are even repeated. As it happens with all movies of Hou Hsiao-Hsien, the effect is not immediate. It is like depot medication: the feeling about the movie is penetrating you slowly, long after it has ended. Sometimes it can take years. The art of Hou is of a special kind: words like wizardry or slow poison are not out of context.

To get the sense of the movie, you should watch carefully the ending scene, taking place in Japan during winter. The fact that a story from Taiwan moves suddenly to Japan is not important: the reason there is the snow! It snowed in Tokyo that winter, remembers Vicky (the sentence sounds so great! the author of the screenplay, Chu Tien-Wen, is one of the most important names in Taiwanese literature).

The movie is about our dreams: they are pure, our dreams, we build them in immaculate snow, we live our lives in the country of snowmen. We dream about eternity: they will live, our dreams, only as long as snowmen live.",1421971200,,3481,4.659609120521172

A ravishing film of urban youth set adrift in the bars and clubs of an ethereally beautiful contemporary Taipei.

Oh yeah, they play in the snow on one occasion. There is no story. There is no development. A waste of one hour and forty five minutes of your life. That the Cannes Film Festival voted this self-indulgent dreck a winner simply boggles the mind.

The real mystery is where pretentious film critics get their adoration for this movie. ""Deeply moving"" says Christian Science Monitor. Yes, moving me to tears. ""An amazing film."" says the New York Post. Amazing that anyone actually went through with this project.

I could point a camera at a wall for six hours and some candypants film critic would no doubt write a profound essay about it. ""Transcendently beautiful. Deeply symbolic of our entire human condition.  A watershed in cinema history.""

Is it that the critics are afraid to look stupid if they say a famous director's movie is a dud? Maybe film school students should reread the The Emperor's New Clothes?

I figured same director same actor it would be a knock out. But I was waiting for something to happen to make all of the hype true but it never came. Which is sad. Anyway, the attempt at filming in a club went horribly wrong, the scenes were difficult to decipher the images because it was all unfocused in one color.. I was hoping they would go more indepth with the relationships that Shu Qi had but it barely touched on them. It was just odd scenes strung together (which is okay) but if they don't have a basis to them, there's no point. Plus her second relationship just comes out of nowhere. This small idea of a man who takes care of her; but there is hardly any scenes with him to make it believable.  Honestly, the best part of the film is the ending (not because its the end)but, because it  basically left Shu Qi to her own vices and when that happens she can pull a viewer in and never let them go.

Personally, there wasn't enough in this film to make it a smash hit. If you are going to buy this film I highly recommend you do your research and make sure the actual plot is enough to tempt you. I bought it because of Shu Qi, if that's your reasoning for buying this film I'd opt for something else.",1236556800,,1356,4.14828897338403
8026600,2,B0002DB5MC,"Millennium Mambo (Hsiao-Hsien Hou, 2001)

I've been trying to write this review for a month, forcing myself to mull this movie over in my head, because everyone and their mothers raves about the films of Hsiao-Hsien Hou. Now, I'm more than willing to admit that I'm just thick most of the time, but I'm not entirely sure that's the case here. Maybe I don't get it because there's just nothing to get.

Millennium Mambo is a slice-of-life film about a bunch of youth. Sex, drugs, and what in slightly earlier days would be rock and roll (but instead, is the pale imitation known as techno). The cast is ensemble, though Vicky (Qi Shu of Sex and Zen II and The Transporter, among many others) is as close to a central character as we've got. She's got a boyfriend who DJs and a pretty nasty drug habit, and much of the film is spent following her around to various clubs and the like. She eventually meets gangster Jack (Jack Gao), who promises her a way out of the endless wheel in which she's trapped, but does she have the courage to take it? And even if she does, is it truly a way to a better life?

There is some good acting to be had here, and there's no doubt Hou is a gifted director. I read a comment on IMDB's message board for the movie that rings true (and reminds me of comments I've read about a number of other movies of this stripe I just didn't get, most recently Spun): ""If you have lived the 'clubbing life' anywhere in the world, you would maybe better understand the movie."" I've never seen the appeal of the clubbing life, even as a casual clubgoer. Millennium Mambo hasn't changed my mind, either to give it more substance or to give it less (which would certainly be another valid interpretation; I might find it more attractive were is sufficiently soul-destroying). Another comment in that same thread: ""You either watch the film and ""live"" it and relate to it, or it is a distant sequence of images flashing on the screen. As the latter the film fails miserably. As the former, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen."" Obviously, for the person being quoted, the film was the former. As I found no way to relate to it, I found it the latter, and his succinct, clear analysis is spot on. * ",1203379200,2,2222,4.385922330097087
