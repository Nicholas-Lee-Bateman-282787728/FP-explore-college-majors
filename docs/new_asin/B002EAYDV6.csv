3916630,4,B002EAYDV6,"OK, so it's not a great film. It's low budget but filmed on location in Europe, and for me cool to watch as it's Montgomery Clift's last role. He died before it was released. It's only one of two movies of his in color, and he really looks like hell in some shots, but that adds to the fascination. Has that other reviewer seen all of Monty's films? He was a great understated actor and even Brando knew he was the only real competition he had as an actor. He would be better remembered today if he played in all the (now) classic films that he turned down because he was so picky. Kudos to Warner for releasing this!",1312416000,4,617,4.19327731092437
3916631,3,B002EAYDV6,"Saw ""The Defector"" (1966), spy thriller by Raoul Lvy, starring Montgomery Clift (in his last role), Hardy Krger, and innumerous others. The director obviously went out of his way to produce a decent contemporary spy movie, containing an intricate plot, suspenseful action, beautiful scenery (lots of nice German locations - both city and countryside - and characteristic locals), tin loads of extras and an unexpected ending. Up to a point, he succeeded in his mission. The movie is certainly enjoyable enough to watch. Unfortunately there are also some drawbacks causing it not to exceed the level of decent mediocrity. I suppose the problem is in the direction, for the leading actors are top-quality performers and the plot and scene setting are lifelike enough. In my experience, the dialogues are very clear - so clear, in fact, that they tend to lose the sort of grim realism and shadiness that might have added to the overall mood expected from this movie genre. The scenes are framed in such a way the viewer is in no doubt what is going on, but is not sucked in at the same time. From what we see, we understand it's all very serious business, but it just doesn't feel that way. The mental torture session in the specially prepared hotel room is gruesome, but it does not send shivers up our spines. The same thing goes for some other scenes in which Bower (Clift) is grilled by the Stasi. The slight caricature qualities of some of the additional characters (uniformed guards, labourers, Frieda Hoffman's (Macha Mril) flat mates) plus the occasionally corny traditional music are not helpful in this respect (the alienating sci-fi music in the torture scene is different - I suppose this was composed by Serge Gainsbourg - the rest seems miles away from his style). I do appreciate the ending of ""The Defector"", which leaves room for speculation (= did this happen by accident or on purpose?), but again, I was not as much in awe as I felt I should have been. In short, ""The Defector"" meets the mark, but could have done without a certain degree of directional awkwardness.",1276992000,2,2083,4.805013927576602
3916632,4,B002EAYDV6,"Anyone who has seen Mongomery Clift's movie stealing turn in ""Judgement At Nuremberg"" knows he was in the midst of a transition from leading man to, what could have been, a marvelous character actor. A lot of that quirkiness shines through in this, Clift's final performance.

This was a low budget movie done by Clift to prove his reliabilty on the set. He had become notorious for drug and alcohol abuse and had caused his prior film to go overbudget by being chronically absent and late. Clift would die of a heart attack shortly after this film was completed.

The film itself is a nice example of the gritty cold-war thrillers in fashion around this time. The script could have used some tightening as could the editing but all in all it works. It remindedd me in some ways of ""The Odessa File"" starring Jon Voigt which would come some years later.

Speaking for myself I was most interested in viewing latter day Montgomery Clift, the actor who inspired both James Dean and Marlon Brando, and was not let down by his off beat performance in this film. One can't help but wish there were more to see from this period of his career. The Misfits and his portrayal of Freud are next for me.",1245888000,21,1192,4.534883720930233

8367344,4,B002EAYDV6,"This movie involves a somewhat complicated spy plot involving an American scientist (Montgomery Clift) who is asked to meet with a Russian scientist when he is on a trip to Leipzig in the DDR in order to deliver some microfilm to the CIA. However, the scientist turns up dead, the microfilm is worthless and it turns out that the secret police are already on to the scientist. Although low-budget, the background and ""texture' of the film rings true. An excellent cold war spy film!",1414540800,2,482,4.75
8367345,5,B002EAYDV6,"I loved it.  At first I was nervous because I'm a huge Clift fan and I knew it was his last film and I've read his bio. and knew why he picked the script.  However, some people are just amazing actors NO MATTER THE MATERIAL, and this one actually had me sitting  on my seat biting my nails until the end.  Very suspenseful, loved it, highly recommend it for all Montgomery Clift fans and anyone that enjoys a good spy thriller!!!",1389139200,3,429,4.2592592592592595
8367346,3,B002EAYDV6,"Passable Cold War intrigue elevated by Montgomery Clift's compelling performance. Reliable support from Hardy Kr&uuml;ger and Roddy McDowall, but Raoul Levy's erratic direction lacks urgency. Cinematographer Raoul Coutard utilizes the German locales to striking effect. ""The Defector"" (1966) is recommended for the unique presence of Clift, who displays remarkable stillness and poignant frailty in his last film.",1381017600,4,413,6.2631578947368425
8367347,5,B002EAYDV6,"Far from a great movie but it's okay. The important thing for Clift fans is seeing the RED RIVER and THE HEIRESS star's last movie, of course, and it's interesting and worth seeing for that reason. Not really recommended for anybody except Montgomery Clift fans.  --Phillip Logan",1374278400,3,279,4.9361702127659575
8367348,2,B002EAYDV6,"How disappointing that a lackluster and dreary cold war spy film should be the final performance of Montgomery Clift. In a brief career of less than 20 films, Clift (1920-66) was nominated for an Oscar 4 times (""Judgment at Nuremberg"", ""From Here to Eternity"", ""A Place in the Sun"", ""The Search"") and his performance in ""Judgment"" received nominations for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe. Personally I liked him best in ""Freud"" (1962) and ""Red River"" (1948), but the truth is that almost all his film roles were great.

FWIW - Clift's health problems, exacerbated by drug and alcohol addiction, resulted in an early death only a few months after finishing this film. He died in July and the film was released in November.

In addition to Clift the cast includes Hardy Kruger, Hannes Messemer, David Opatshu, and Roddy McDowell

German born Hardy Kruger (1928) appeared in 50+ films, usually as a German (""A Bridge too Far"", ""War and Remembrance"").

Roddy McDowell (1928-98) was nominated for a Golden Globe for ""Cleopatra"" (1963) and was nominated twice for an  Emmy, winning for ""Sunday Showcase"" (1959). He appeared in more than 200 films, usually as a second male lead, and is probably best known for his role as Cornelius/Caesar in ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968, 1972, 1973, 1974). He was a good friend of Clift.

Hannes Messemer (1924-91) has a brief role as a physician spy. He's best known as the Commandant from ""The Great Escape"" (1963).

The direction from Raoul Levy is so poor it might be used to instruct film students. Precious screen time is wasted watching Clift walk down hallways and across grass, and most of the film is shot with a static camera and medium to long shots. Such an approach creates a distance with the film and the characters which serves to undermine the film.

FWIW - Levy died shortly after the film premiered.

In addition, about 30 minutes into the film there is a ""nightmare"" scene (if that's what it is) that is completely out of sync with the rest of the film. It looks like it came from Clift's previous film, ""Freud"".

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther praised the production values - ""strong and striking scenic detail""... ""excellent color camera work"" - but criticized the script  - ""uneven and sometimes vapid"" ... ""slapdash, loose and mechanical"".

There is really no reason to recommend this film apart from a ghoulish need to see Clift in his final performance. But try to resist the temptation because you're better off remembering him for all of his other many excellent performances.",1313971200,4,2525,4.819444444444445
