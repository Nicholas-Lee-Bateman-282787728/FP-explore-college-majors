NEXT TIME SOMEONE TRIES TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT URBAN PUERTO RICANS HOPEFULLY THEY WILL MAKE IT A COMEDY",1183766400,,311,4.571428571428571
2412576,2,B000BCE922,"Not Boricua, but Cubana born in Miami. Grew up in Hialiah nearly my whole life.  Hopeful that all the Boricuas out there who hate this movie allow me to include my point of view.  First of all, easy on our girl Marisol.  At least someone, a few people out there are making movies about Latino/a people and at least TRYING to tell our stories while employing Latino/a actors.  Do any of you remember the 'Brown-Out' back in 1999 when Latinos held a high profile boycott of network TV due to no Latino actors? Google that please.  In this movie I would say one of the major problems is that the characters are too one-dimensional.  They JUST deal drugs and hang out or just suck

d-ck or just take advantage or get taken advantage of.  The plot could have been developed better.  There could have been more explanation of and exposure to what is beautiful about Boricua culture, the musicos, the artists, the island.  Yet the topics it covered are certainly worth thinking about.  1. How the pressure to assimilate in either a negative way(Herman come-mierda) or positive way (Lola) can and will cut us off from our community in disasterous ways and/or in more subtle ways that give way to awkwardness when we interact with our gente.  2. How our Latino culture, in this case Boricua, is beautiful and there have ALWAYS been people from the dominant culture, i.e. white, TRYIN TO BE US, but as much as they might love us or think they do, can we trust the wanna bes among us? (TATA).  3. How in business we MUST stick together if we're going to make it instead of cutting our brothers/sister's throat.  Why didn't Herman comemierda start his own business and work with his gente instead of against them? 4. Drugs.  It's an issue in all communities yes, but why worry about the other communities until we get our own house in order first. Let's remind ourselves to keep the drugs out of our neighborhoods! 5. Women. Thinking how nearly all of the hermanas got treated in this movie, it can be a reality yes, and serves as a reminder to respect our beautiful Latina sisters and always treat them with reverence. Entendiste? The flick is a bit rough around the edges and perhaps undercooked in some areas, but I support Marisol's effort. Worth taking a look at.",1154217600,,2256,4.5910224438902745
2412577,1,B000BCE922,"The white people were not portrayed well in this movie either. As a gringo who has always liked hispanics, I found it disturbing to see Puerto Rican characters always regarding white people as rude, calculating, ruthless, and prejudiced. German/Herman's conversion into that kind of person is not so much about the difference between hispanics and whites but rather the difference between, say, a small, family-owned business and impersonal corporate culture.

If you want to see some really good movies about Hispanic Americans, try Raising Victor Vargas, Wassup Rockers, Manito, and La Ciudad. (I've heard that Washington Heights is also good, but I haven't seen that one yet.)",1149292800,3,679,5.345794392523365
2412578,5,B000BCE922,"It is about time someone writes about the realities that Puerto Ricans are faced with in the inner city. Although this movie was not intended to be the ""be all and end all"" of any Puerto Rican community, it touches on real issues and obstacles that many of us face on a daily bases.

The movie touches on issues of Identity, Sexuality, Substance Abuse and Gentrification. I give Marisol Torres and the cast 2 thumbs up for addressing issues that most people would not dare go near beacuse they are not ""Politicaly Correct.""",1137456000,7,523,4.623655913978495
2412579,1,B000BCE922,"I am in agreement with all the ricans who have written reviews.

I just rented this movie called Chicago Boricua. I was

excited coz the back of the box says it's in Humbolt Park. The only

place in chicago that I am familiar with. I am orginally from NY. So I watched it and man was i

disappointed! not only  me but my whole family. My mother was appalled to say the least. There aren't a lot of movies out there about puertoricans . And this one has nothing positive to say about Puerto Rican culture. Which is a beautiful and giving culture rich with hertiage. This movie would make anybody that saw it not want to come to Humbolt park. Which from what I have learned is a proud and old neighborhood in Chicago. I have been there every year for the parade and off and on during the year at different times of the day and have found it safe.

 Overall If I could get my money back for this piece of garbage I would. I honestly rate this a Negative 5.",1137456000,4,953,4.146739130434782
2412580,1,B000BCE922,"I am a Puerto Rican male that lived most of my life in the Chicago Area where the film was shot.

( I attended Roberto Clemente High School - where the main character of the movie attended)

Hence , I was very in this film.

I hated this movie. It makes my skin craw when I think of other people watching it. All of the Puerto Rican charaters are presented in a very negative way.

Everyone involved in this movie should be ashame !!

Trash...

Thanks Alot !!!

8085039,2,B000BCE922,"Unfortunately the DVD release of Boricua by Screen Media is 1.85:1 within a 4:3 frame with the result that in order to watch it in the correct ratio you need black bars on all sides of the screen.  Not uncommon in the time of 4:3 analogue TVs but annoying for owners of modern TVs.
The transfer is OK but not great quality. Also beware that the disc may not have any subtitles.  The DVD sleeve says spanish subtitles but in fine print below is ""subject to change"". That's a new one to me, So it's basically lucky dip whether the DVD you purchase has subtitles or not. In my case, it did not.

Overall a lackluster release but since there are no other releases it's this or nothing (legal that is)..",1407715200,,698,4.312977099236641

8085041,1,B000BCE922,"I really hate to give any more publicity to an incredibly offensive movie, but on netflix I saw Chicago Boricua because I thought it would be interesting to see something about Puerto Ricans for a change. After enduring 15 minutes, I had to turn it off because I thought it did nothing more than just perpetuated stereotypes. I grew up in Chicago and have Puerto Ricans friends, so I know they are better than that. For people who will believe what they see in film, I hope they never see this film.",1332460800,,499,4.434782608695652
8085042,5,B000BCE922,"I agree there should be more Positive films about Puerto Rican life. This film was in a mix bag, I enjoyed some of the film and scenes also music. True many white people do treat Puerto Ricans and latinos in general different and a lot of times in prejudice ways without saying it, I am glad that was in the film. I did not like the Ghetto Puerto Rican with afro or any Ghetto negative stereotypes of the mom smoking in kitchen area etc..But why did I give it a lot of stars?Maybe because I seen an effort of trying to capture something about Puerto Ricans on screen, I can see the effort with the director and its actors,the storyline might not be great or negativity but still it has its moments and deserves more than one star..This is Not a Ghetto cheap Mexican gangser film or Boricuas Bond poorly everything, it is just an ok and deserves a little more love. If you want great Quality/Interesting story telling..there is ""Blue Diner"" starring Miriam Colon,""Cayo"" starring Roselyn Sanchez,""Yellow"" starring Roselyn Sanchez,""El Cantante"" starring Jennifer Lopez,""West Side Story"" with Rita Moreno,""I Like It Like That"" starring Lauren Velez and ""Yo Soy Boricua"" with Rosie Perez..all interesting,well acted and heart of Puerto Rican people.",1322956800,,1244,4.872641509433962
8085043,4,B000BCE922,"This movie was very entertaining.  It wasn't meant to be a social statement.  Most movies or shows aren't meant to be.  I don't believe all Puerto Ricans, or Caucasians, are like those depicted in this movie, as I don't believe all Italians are like those portrayed in The Sopranos or The Godfather.

Having said that, there were some positive images.  Maribel's father so loved her, that at her request (wrong that it was), he sold his beloved home and store to please her.  And certain images of family solidarity, though convoluted, were demonstrated.

Anyway, I liked the drama, and some of the humor.

Oh, and German got what he deserved.",1216512000,,643,4.781818181818182
8085044,1,B000BCE922,I am Puerto Rican. This a complete embarrassment to all Puerto Ricans. I had to forward through most of the movie to avoid the completely ridiculous scenes.,1193529600,,156,4.814814814814815
8085045,1,B000BCE922,"I am a Puerto Rican also, who grew up, knowing about all the different branches of our heritage... Yes, there are Puerto Rican, who hate other races... like everyone else... but, you know what? Not all of us are that way... I am proud to be called a ""Boricua"", which apparently, the writer of this low rated movie, does not know where that nickname came from...
I have to agree with these people, who have written their comments... this movie is an insult to our loving culture, that has whites, blacks, even asian descendants, coming to full circle, in our daily lives. We live in the same neighborhood, and still, we get along.

So, when you pick this video... make sure you know, that this is not the real Boricuas here.",1190419200,,723,4.519083969465649
