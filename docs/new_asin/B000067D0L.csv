I have noticed some mixed reviews about this product with most of the negative ones being ghost written by our competition so i wanted to tell everyone the real truth about this product since we are the people who produced it. I am using my wifes Amazon account to post this.

 We have taken some of the greatest classic cartoons ever produced, from some of the greatest animators in history, and meticulously added hundreds of hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars of detailed restoration to both the sound and images in order to make them look as good as they did the day they were first released. Each cartoon is digitally processed first through photo shop frame by frame, and then using both the Davinci and the new Pogo systems to remove every scratch, line, dropout and artifact possible. We then we do a full color restoration at Technicolor using the original color palates to match the colors, tones and shades. We then digitally clean up the sound track to remove all the hiss and scratches and carefully add new foley sound effects, ambience and digitally remix them back onto the cartoons.

The result is our animated DVD series which is currently distributed in both the United States and Canada by Goodtimes Entertainment. These fully restored, full motion, color animations have not been seen in this condition since their original theatrical release. Sit back and be amazed and enjoy some of the finest and funniest animation ever made.

thats why were to only studio doing these that have the blessing and participation of Fleischer Studios and the only one to receive the prestigious Gold Medal from the Classic Animation Preservation Society.

I highly recomend this product to any lovers of classic animation.",1112054400,,1775,4.9
7962653,5,B000067D0L,"This DVD features female cartoon characters from the 1930s and 1940s - most notably Betty Boop. Most of the story lines are clever and entertaining. My kids thoroughly enjoy them, as do I. The cartoons are reasonably well restored, which, in view of the exceptional price, was a wonderful surprise. The two Little Lulu cartoons did not restore very well, though, and look a little washed out. Two of the very best and most elaborate Betty Boop cartoons are found here (Poor Cinderella and Betty in Blunderland). The Grampy cartoons are also great. The best non-Boop cartoon here is Tarts and Flowers. Poor Cinderella is on the new Max Fleischer Cartoon Classics DVD, but the quality of it here is a little better. From a PC standpoint, Betty Boop is in respectable attire in all of the cartoons except Blunderland. New sound effects are added, which are obtrusive when the sound is run through my stereo, but effective enough when played through my cheap TV speakers. There is no audio feature allowing viewers to forego the sound effects tracks. GoodTimes apparently provided no product detail to Amazon about this DVD. The disk contains no special features and the ten cartoons, totaling 71 minutes, are as follows:
(1) Poor Cinderella (Betty Boop, Color Classic - two color)
(2) The Scared Crows (Betty Boop, B&W)
(3) The Seapreme Court (Little Audrey, color)
(4) A Scout with the Gout (Little Lulu, color)
(5) Betty in Blunderland (Betty Boop, B&W)
(6) Tarts and Flowers (Little Audrey, color)
(7) Toonerville Trolley (Van Beuren cartoon, featuring a large house frau, color)
(8) Bargain Counter Attack (Little Lulu, color)
(9) House cleaning Blues (Betty Boop, Grampy, B&W)
(10) Grampy's Indoor Outing (Betty Boop, Grampy, B&W)",1037059200,26,1732,5.017361111111111
