8297393,3,B001EASNTA,More a demo of each star playing instead of an actual how to play DVD. Fine if you just want to see them noodle for a bit. For an actual lesson check out Kiss Forever or one of George Lynchs actual instruction DVDs.,1299542400,,215,4.023255813953488
8297394,5,B001EASNTA,"Really Good DVD. I would call it more inspirational than a standard ""How To"". Each artist really delves into what goes on in their head when they are coming up with their solos and song structures. I highly doubt I will ever reach the playing ability of Jennifer Batten, but it is cool to see her play with an actual explanation behind it. What hasn't already been said about George Lynch? The guy is a legend. Bruce Kulick of KISS shows how to play complete songs from one of his solo records and they have Darrell Roberts from Five finger Death Punch show some of his tips and techniques. Darrell is more ""new school"" low tuning metal so they give you a little bit of everything in here. If ""fast riff groove metal"" is your thing. I would suggest picking up Five Finger Death Punch, they are a great band.

The 2nd DVD also has bonus segments featuring some very young kids that can blow doors of a lot off a lot of more ""seasoned players"". That being said, the best thing about these DVD's is that you become really motivated to buckle down and work on your craft.",1252368000,2,1067,4.36180904522613
