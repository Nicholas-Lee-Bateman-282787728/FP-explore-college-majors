2255855,5,B00080ZG3I,I loved watching this on OPB! It was after I traveled there so I was excited to see where exactally I was and what it looked like from above. I personally loved the soundtrack to this. The soft classical music was great. I also loved the narrator. She had a lovely soothing accent. I looked online a long time ago to see if I could purchase it and the only way was to donate $90 to the Oregon Public Broadcasting network. But now I can!!,1130889600,10,437,4.152941176470589
2255856,1,B00080ZG3I,"This video video beautiful to look at.

And boy is it terrible to listen to.  I was actually so irritated by the obnoxious narration I had to hit the mute button.

First off, the sound quality of the narration is horrible.  It sounds like they recorded it with a cheap karaoke microphone, it is distorted in places and has a very muddy and boomy quality to it.  The female narrator seems to be trying to sound so ""British"" while reading her script that she ends up sounding like an American drama student doing a poor British accent.  And worst of all, the actual script is full of inane and slightly offensive comments like ""We can take an auto to London, but we'll have to remember to stay on the left side!""  and ""Newmarket is home to the world's greatest thoroughbreds.  Though a Yank from Lexington, Kentucky may have something to say about that!""  and ""Covent Garden Market is where Henry Higgins discovered Eliza Doolittle, but the market buildings have been turned into shops and boutiques for tourists.  Wouldn't it be loverly if they could return?""  Seriously, I found it much more enjoyable with the sound off.  Perhaps the producers could have added a music-only audio track to the DVD.

The movie was made with a camera attached to a helicopter, and every shot is spectacular.  However, the helicopter seems to circle nearly every landmark in a counter-clockwise direction and it made me dizzy after a while.

This production is obviously intended for an American audience, specifically one that has no understanding of England other than what they know from Hollywood.  Embarassing.  One star for breathtaking pictures, serious negatives for annoying narration and excessive counter-clockwise rotation.",1124409600,16,1716,4.964912280701754
2255857,5,B00080ZG3I,Wonderful! Watching this video brings back memories of my travels to England.,1121817600,5,77,5.5
2255858,5,B00080ZG3I,"Quite amazing footage. You feel like you are flying over england. I watched this on PBS about a year ago, I am very excited for its public release.",1114560000,7,147,4.285714285714286
2255859,2,B00080ZG3I,"I was born, brought up and educated in England but moved to the USA thirty years ago, so I was looking forward to viewing this DVD when it was released. Unfortunately I was as disappointed in the product as I suspect other British ex-pats will be. Why on earth did the directors opt for a narrator who is obviously not British? The affected upper class English accent delivered by someone who appears to be Italian (the same narrator as employed in Visions of Italy??) is simultaneously laughable and cringe-inducing. Furthermore, I have to say that although the video images are for the most part enjoyable to watch, I don't understand why they were edited to bounce geographically around the country rather than following some form of logical route.
This product could have been so much better.",1380499200,,796,4.860294117647059
2255860,4,B00080ZG3I,"Nicely dine video to show views of England that caanot be found from a tour bus.

The narration is a bit hard to understand as the womans voice is somewhat soft and quite British.

Worth the investment to get it",1374537600,,211,4.25
2255861,5,B00080ZG3I,"I love Visions series that PBS has done.  This one of England has shown me so much more of the country than I was aware of, and done to beautiful music and non-intrusive narration.  The historical sights, especially the castles are wonderful seen from the air.  This is another country on my ""bucket list"".  I recommend this dvd, it is great for armchair travel.",1371859200,2,362,4.609375
2255862,5,B00080ZG3I,Anyone who can not afford to take a real vacation should buy these videos. Very educational. Great  views of places you might go to.  I recommend to Anyone and Everyone,1365465600,,168,4.566666666666666
2255863,5,B00080ZG3I,"Even though it was over 70 minutes in length, it left me wanting for more! Wonderfully done and captioned and the Bonus Footage is always a treat! Much like the Visions of Ireland and Scotland that I already own! Probably could have been a two dvd set of England, as there is so much there to see that wasn't mentioned!",1339459200,2,319,4.333333333333333
2255864,4,B00080ZG3I,"This Visions series video provides nice coverage of many highlights of England (although I wish we could have seen an aerial of Hampton Court)--cathedrals, palaces, ruins, pastures, gardens, colleges, city scenes (with thorough views of London), etc. I also think the music matched up nicely with the scenes (unlike Visions of Ireland, which seemed mismatched in places).

The narration isn't overly enlightening, but I found it lightheartedly charming. However, I do somewhat worry that after repeated viewings the narration will become tiresome. Interestingly, the 19 minutes of extra footage only has music and the labels of each locale (no narration), which is very relaxing to watch and unobtrusive. (Too bad there isn't an option to turn off narration for the main video.)

Overall, I was really satisfied with this video and plan to watch it many times! It brings back fond memories of my travels to England, and the cinematography is so crisp and beautifully detailed (especially on a high-def screen) that I can imagine being there.",1321488000,3,1041,5.227544910179641
2255865,1,B00080ZG3I,"Why on earth wasn't someone from England selected to provide the commentary to this video? It is extremely distracting to listen to the narrator's laughable attempt at an upper-class British accent while mispronouncing words as the scenery rolls by. And couldn't the video have been edited so that it traced a journey around the country rather than leaping from one part of the country to a distant part? As an English expatriot, I was very disappointed by this product.",1290643200,,470,4.962025316455696
2255866,3,B00080ZG3I,"A good insight into the landscape of England but for me several area's were missed off. ie - The coastline and fishing villages of Devon and Cornwall. Derbyshire, which has some fantastic scenery and Northumberland were not mentioned. The lake district? The music was average and not always to the taste of the viewer so much better in my opinion to see without music but to include natural sounds. However I bought this to show my foreign students and much can be gleaned from the contents.",1278460800,,491,4.72093023255814
2255867,3,B00080ZG3I,"I enjoyed seeing targeted sites from a bird's eye view, but the narrator's script wasn't of the same quality as the spectacular visuals.  As she bounced from place to place, it would have been helpful to see a map of England to know where a location was compared to the last one shown.  My wife and daughter became bored with the narrator and left the room before the DVD finished.  I agree with other reviewers' comments about the desirability of street level shots and scenes showing the changing seasons.  I would add the following to that:  Besides showing historical places, the DVD should have lived up to its name by capturing something of the English culture.  England is more than buildings, waterways and fields.",1278460800,,722,4.782258064516129
2255868,5,B00080ZG3I,A beautiful fly over of England.  It is a must for those preparing to visit England or those who have and want to relive their experience.,1277078400,,138,4.3076923076923075
2255873,3,B00080ZG3I,"While ""Visions Of England"" shows some wonderful, beautiful scenery, I can't see why the West Country and the Midlands were omitted. Now strictly speaking, I can understand why Wales was omitted, but Dorset & Cornwall? Birmingham & Manchester? Norwich & Norfolk? Is Somerset and Avon only the bishopric of Bath & Wells(both of which I love)? Where's Yorkshire, except York and Flamborough Head? There's a shot of the Solent, and Southampton, but where's Portsmouth? While I don't need to see the ferry cross the Mersey, Liverpool was only on the Extra.
 Speaking of Southampton, the narrator blathers a bit about ocean liners and cruise ships, while the screen shows the former Royal yacht Britannia.
 ""Visions Of England"" is tailor-made for PBS, but unfortunately not the PBS I grew up watching, but the PBS that shoved ""Lord Of The Dance"" down our throats, and now stuffs ""Doctor(of Education)"" Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra, Andre Rieu, Suze Orman, & The Irish Women over our gums & towards our tums.
 Also, the narrator, Franca Barchiesi, became terribly aggravating after just a couple of minutes, and tosses in some cutesy lines, like ""...you know, 1066 and all that.."" and something stupid about Eliza Doolittle and Professor Henry Higgins, and how Covent Garden is now ""shops and boutiques for tourists"". Fortunately, the ""additional footage"" omits Ms Barchiesi. Evidently she's quite an accomplished actress, and while her voice is pleasant, her accent didn't seem true, & sure enough, think ""Bridget Jones"", an American trying to sound British. I'd have loved audio options for ""music only"", or a different voiceover. All her voice needs is backmusic by Enya.
 Evidently there's a new edition of Visions Of England"" that includes Wales and Scotland. Hopefully it doesn't include Barchiesi, or at least does include some audio options......",1262476800,2,1844,5.198653198653199

2255876,5,B00080ZG3I,"I was trying to find something similar to Epcott's video VISIONS OF FRANCE, which was absolutely breathtaking.  This does it.  Filmed form a helicopter with a panoramic view, this series will take your breath away.  As a Professor, I use the series to get students excited about study abroad in Europe.  Mission accomplished.

2255878,5,B00080ZG3I,"Much like most of you out there I first became acquainted with the `Vision Series' of aerial travelogue features on PBS television. Whenever I came upon one while channel surfing I'd immediately put the remote down and sit back and relax. It wasn't long before I decided these programs were something I'd never tire of watching and needed to be added to my private DVD collection.

Released in '05, `Visions of England' is the third production in the series. As with the previous two (Greece and Italy) immediately the audience is whisked away high above the maddening crowd to view an England, both urban and rural, in breathtaking fashion. The music is beautifully in sync with the visuals as is the narration. A treat to be enjoyed by the traveler in all of us.",1208131200,6,764,4.701492537313433

2255880,5,B00080ZG3I,"I can only echo what the other reviewers have written about ""Visions of
England"" the only complaints I have with it are the music is quite different from what I heard on PBS, There is no listing of the music pieces in the booklet, which would have been a nice addition to the booklet. As some of the reivewers wrote there is so much more scenery that could have been put on the disc. Though as it is a nice time can be spent watching this DVD which can be said about any of the ""Visions"" series.",1203206400,,495,4.11340206185567

2255882,1,B00080ZG3I,"Avid Samantha Brown and Rick Steves' fans, our family thought we'd branch out and try other travel DVD's.  We invested in VISIONS OF ENGLAND as well as several others from that series.  After watching VISIONS OF ENGLAND three times, we almost returned to Amazon the others in the series without opening, so disheartening was the one on England.  While the aerial shots are breathtaking and the music is lovely, the lack of narration meant our children and we learned almost nothing from the experience.  The narration gave very little information on where the shots were taken and what we were viewing.  If we could, we'd send it back for a refund.  Invest instead in VISIONS OF ITALY (yes, we did go ahead and try another despite our disappointment in VISIONS OF ENGLAND).",1198800000,6,773,4.818181818181818
2255893,5,B00080ZG3I,"'Flyovers' can be thrilling experiences and  ""Visions of England"" does not disappoint with its 'visits' to places we have enjoyed in past years ... even Longleat, and tiny Glossop & Cheddar Gorge.  This DVD is filled with memories for us and happily a few magical views of places to include on the 'next' itinerary are also shown.  For my taste the Bronte country and Beatrix Potter's (& Wordsworth's) Lake District deserve more attention.

The photography from a helicopter is superb.  It reminds this traveler of flying into Heathrow, always glimpsing at least one recognizable landmark, be it bridge, castle, the Thames or Big Ben.  Obviously, the DVD was produced with more than our pleasure in mind.  Yes, I found the narration a bit ""over the top"" and might relegate the cutesy comments to a bus tour for 'seniors' ... but I tell myself  ""to each his own.""  My preference would be a more literary approach with quotations from literary figures, straight from their roots.

Bonus flights accompanied by appropriate music (without narration) treat viewers to ""the even playing fields"" of Britain, sumptuous gardens and a motor launch on Lake Windermere among other sights.

A valued 'extra' would be a booklet including an overall map with 'gps' insets and a few shots of interiors to further whet our appetites.  Reviewer mcHaiku recommends watching ""Visions of England"" (and similar DVDs) for escapism in the truest sense but also for sensible aids to planning your future travels.

2255896,4,B00080ZG3I,"I bought this dvd as a treat for myself - I absolutely love England.  It's hard to go wrong with the natural beauty of England. The dvd is quite relaxing and enjoyable.  The voiceover can be a bit tiresome  - she's a bit overly grandiose in her delivery.  The visuals - mostly by airplane - aren't quite as stirring as the ""Visions of Germany -  Along the Rhine"" was - that one really was enchanting and the voiceover was more informative.  This is still a very nice hour spent enjoying the natural beauty and history uniquely shown by helicopter and airplane along with lovely background music.

Only weakness in this series of DVDs is that they never show you a map, so you can see where in the country you are.  But due to the overall quality of the DVD, I give it a top grade.  I only wish the company producing this series would hurry up and publish more discs on more places.",1153699200,9,414,4.269230769230769

I had the great privilege to stay in England for five weeks one summer, so I love to look back on my trip and reminisce through pictures, books, movies, etc.. I bought this movie, Visions of England,"" as part of a set (Visions of Great Britain and Ireland). Of the 4 countries it features, this is my second to least favorite (Wales being last). I do enjoy looking at all the sights of places I had seen while on my trip, and also experience viewing places I unfortunately was not able to see while in England, but the quality of this movie was greatly lacking. First off, I hate, hate, HATE the narrator. Her voice is so dull and quiet and you just want to fall asleep or shut off the TV listening to her. I am not sure what PBS was thinking when they hired her. And second, the music was not very enjoyable. I absolutely loved the music in the Visions of Ireland and Visions of Scotland; they almost made you feel like you were in a fairy tale when watching the movies. Visions of England's music is rather boring and not very catchy. I also was felt like they left out some gorgeous sights that I had seen while in England, but I suppose they aren't as well known as other places. Overall, I was a bit disappointed watching this movie. I think I will keep it just to be able to look back on my memories of England, but I think I will try to find something else in the meantime.",1467763200,,1481,4.25531914893617

Music is at a pleasant level at 10 in comparision to th e20 necessary to hear the narration..  This reviewer would have preferred a music only opion.

The video is shot from helicopter so the view is from above.  While sections of the video are excellent there also periods that really don't provide a ' vision of England'. - for example showing a cruise ship out at seal
