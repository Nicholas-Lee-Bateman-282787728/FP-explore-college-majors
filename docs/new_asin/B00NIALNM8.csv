8678407,1,B00NIALNM8,"Stravinsky was a Jew?  A Bolshevik?? Hindemith wrote his opera _Mathis der Maler_ to oppose the Nazis?  Oh?  Says who?  Its the Shostakovich wars redux, with sensationalized talk of lurking secret messages in Hindemiths music and words.

No, this isn't a biography, rather it is a factually incorrect hagiography.  The notes claim that part one is a brief historical lecture.  (Well, it _is_ short.)  After this opening Hindemith completely disappears from the film (aside from his Mathis der Maler Symphony being used as the soundtrack).  Gr&uuml;newald, and especially Bunyans Pilgrims Progress_ take over.  But wait, it is all so slickly done here, with spiffily garbed actors depicting the Last Supper, etc., juxtaposing frightening footage of Hitler et al; and the narrators words are uttered with such conviction (nay solemnity) that the entire package must be true, right?  Sorry, but I don't think this attempt to portray Hindemith as a Nazi dissident will cut the mustard.  Check the facts for yourself, please.  For heavens sake don't believe me or this alluring bottle of snake oil.  (BTW, I am being sarcastic about the spiffily garbed actors.  Trick or Treat! '  (Confession: I will use the last two minutes showing the Isenheim Altarpiece in all its splendor and glory capped by the climax of MdM in my 20th Century music history classes.)",1466553600,2,1353,5.109589041095891
8678408,1,B00NIALNM8,"Relatively little of this short film is about Hindemith. Most of it consists of readings from Bunyan's A Pilgrim's Progress by John Gielgud accompanied musically by Mathis der Maler and visually by assorted film and images... Hitler, Nazi rallies, the Isenheim Altarpiece as well as some images of Hindemith. Only the narration for the first ten minutes deals with Hindemith and that part is stunningly amateurish, containing glaring errors....strangely this film was made just a few years after Palmer's documentary on Stravinsky (Once At A Border) yet this film claims that Stravinsky was a Jewish Bolshevik.... ironic since Stravinsky was an anti communist known to have had an antisemitic streak.  This film is that bad.",1451088000,4,724,5.2956521739130435
