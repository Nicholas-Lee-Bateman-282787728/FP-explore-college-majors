I love Egyptian art and always pleased with mostly everything, however I was very upset that I lost my money and will not watch this DVD again.
The DVD should specify that is a conference with little regard for the filming quality of it.

8378941,4,B002RWK996,"Good lecture about this mystery Orion constelation and Egyptian pyramids.
Nevertheless there are some other films or documentaries about this subject.
I did not watch this product in my DVD player only in my computer (this maybe is a CD-R or DVD-R like a CD-ROM)",1265673600,,262,4.844444444444444
