8264204,4,B0016ST4YI,"Set in the 1600s, Rouben Mamoulian's QUEEN CHRISTINA is considered by many to be Greta Garbo's best film. It is if one accepts this as a total work of fiction, perhaps.

The real Christina was mistaken for a boy at birth, and when this error was discovered was still raised as a son and called ""prince."" She had her father's homely looks and was proficient in such manly activities as horseback riding, fencing and shooting. Crowned ""king"" at age six, Christina's education was tailored for a male royal, with tutoring in religion, philosophy, Greek and Latin. Her teachers said she had a male temperament.

Christina's autobiography reveals she never wished to marry and that the usual concerns of women were foreign to her. Contemporaries believed her to be gay-- more likely Christina was transgendered. She courted beautiful women, wore a mixture of male and female attire, moved, spoke and behaved as a man, having many male comrades (not lovers).

After abdicating the throne at age 28 in favor of her cousin Charles, Christina traveled extensively for many years in France and Italy.

The movie version of this unusual royal gives only a couple of hints as to her gender identity and sexuality. The script instead chooses to center around a fictional love affair with a Spanish ambassador. It's well done but historically VERY unsatisfying. The real Christina was far more interesting than Garbo's. A great opportunity to tell her fascinating story was squandered in this pre-Code motion picture.

As for Greta Garbo, she was a fine actress with a hard, angular face that's especially noticeable in her portrayal of the manly Christina.

John Gilbert was often paired with Garbo in silent photoplays and he's with her here for the last time. Gilbert's acting career was not (as is claimed) destroyed by his voice --which was fine-- but from a severe case of alcoholism, plus quarrels with MGM directors and their bosses who then actively sabotaged him. He made one more movie after ""Christina"" and died in 1936 of an alcohol-induced heart attack. John Gilbert was 36 years old at time of death.
