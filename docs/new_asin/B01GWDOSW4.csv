Verger-When the board finds out their church verger of 17 years can neither read nor write, they fire him. He marries and opens a shop. A cute twist at the end makes this story endearing.
Mr. Know-All-Obnoxious know-it-all annoys everyone. A pleasant comedy.
Sanatorium-Stories of the various personalities, conflicts, and love in a TB in a sanatorium.
Very good filmed versions of Maughams stories. The plot twists are similar to the O. Henry stories. Well worth watching.",1468972800,,585,5.104166666666667
