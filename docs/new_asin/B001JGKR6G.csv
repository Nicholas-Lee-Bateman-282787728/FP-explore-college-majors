I purchased this video, and it comes with tablature. It is exactly what I've been looking for. Orrin doesn't waste your time teaching you how to tune, read tab, or learning the basics. He explains the syncopated rhythms and arranging. Not only that, he teaches you some KILLER arrangements of Old Joe Clark, Whiskey Before Breakfast, Cherokee Shuffle, and more.  How many Mel Bay or Hal Leonard books start at the beginning and then end when you're just out of the gate? You're left sounding like a child. This DVD gives you the tools to take a simple tune, arrange it, and sound like a pro...with practice of course. This was a great investment. For the price of less than one lesson, I got an intensive two hour education. How many opportunities do you get to study under a National Champion Flatpicker? Check out his site at OrrinStar-dotcom.
Thanks Orrin!",1395014400,,868,4.7105263157894735
