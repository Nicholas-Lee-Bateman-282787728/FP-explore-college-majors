8386008,5,B0030TXXL6,"I highly recommend this DVD! It is very imformative and helpful in learning yoga techniques you can do right at your desk. Sitting all day long in your cubicle can compromise your posture, contributing to muscle and head aches that interfere with your work. Using this DVD will help keep your body and mind going strong. This in turn will help with your job performance. I have found this to be true for myself. I am a mother of two very small children who doesn't have time to make it to a yoga class. Having the ability to do yoga at my desk not only refreshes me, it improves my work attitude. Feeling good about myself and work carries over into my ""mom role"". The energy and inner peice I feel allows me to be a better Mom and ready to take care of my children and household tasks. I hope you will enjoy this DVD and find it as helpful as I have!
