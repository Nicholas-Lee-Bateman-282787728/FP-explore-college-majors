8042451,5,B0006Q944G,"Great learning DVD! I have a son with autism and he absolutely loves the Hard Hat Harry series. He would watch them on a continuous loop. I will caution you, however, if you watch this video over and over with your child, you will start to drem about Hard Hat Harry coming to sweep you off of your feet and whisk you away from your mundane life and into a whirlwind of *gasp* police cars and fire trucks!",1440115200,,404,4.1923076923076925
8042452,5,B0006Q944G,My kids are 7 and 5 and love watching all the Hard Hat Harry DVDs!,1437609600,,66,3.466666666666667
8042453,5,B0006Q944G,"This is for the really young 4 to 5 year olds, but it's fun watching for any age group really.  Grandson loved this and the other HHH's adventures.  He's fun and informative.

Seller:  Great service and highly recommend",1389225600,,219,4.684210526315789
8042454,5,B0006Q944G,"This is a ""corny"" series but I have yet to meet a toddler boy that didn't love it.  Our son asks for HARD HAT HARRY everytime he sees a dump truck.  The videos are also informative and talk about the basics of each topic or vehicle highlighted.",1353456000,,244,4.170212765957447
8042455,5,B0006Q944G,"We got several of these videos, and although I think they were made in the late 80's/early 90's, it doesn't matter to a little boy. All the titles are fun and interesting. Hope you enjoy. Highly recommend!",1338940800,,205,4.5675675675675675
8042456,3,B0006Q944G,"I thought it was going to have more ""adventures""! It is ok! My boys lose interest quickly with this dvd.",1311897600,,104,4.25
8042457,5,B0006Q944G,"I would highly recommend this video to anyone who has children who love rescue vehicles!! My 3 year old son is fascinated by rescue vehicles, especially fire trucks.  He absolutely loves watching this video over and over.",1285891200,,221,4.972972972972973
8042458,5,B0006Q944G,"This is such a wonderful series.  My son, who is almost 4, has several of the videos and absolutely loves watching them.  Harry is very engaging as a character and even I have learned a thing or two from the videos.",1168473600,2,215,4.219512195121951
