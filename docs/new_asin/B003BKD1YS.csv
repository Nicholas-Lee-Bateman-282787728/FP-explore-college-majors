4106693,5,B003BKD1YS,"Obviously, the extreme brevity of the film should be noted.  Ford apparently put this together simply to provide it to the next of kin of the squadron, not for commercial use.  It's ghostly, knowing the fate awaiting almost all of the crews in the ensuing Battle of Midway (an Ens. Gay was the sole survivor of this squadron).

Note the close-ups of the squadron's aircraft: the TBD-1 Devastator.  There is comparatively little film of these.  This obsolete plane type was withdrawn from combat shortly after the Battle of Midway, 4 June 1941 (as was one of the fighter types used by the U.S.: the F2A-3 Buffalo).  Of 41 Devastators lauched, only 6 returned to the carriers (of 20 Buffalos sent up from Eastern Island, only 7 returned).",1325116800,2,736,4.755905511811024
4106694,5,B003BKD1YS,"This is actually a picture that was made to honor the men of Torpedo Squadron 8.  This film is unusual in the fact that one of Ford's film units filmed all of the men before they took off for a mission from which they would not return.  It stands as a testimony to the courage and determination of these young men.  Torpedo Squadron 8 was lost at the Battle of Midway.  It stand as a moving memorial to these brave aircrews that sacrificed their lives to help change the course of the war in the Pacific.  It's not your typical ""war movie documentary"".",1320105600,5,552,4.320388349514563
4106695,1,B003BKD1YS,"I recieved this movie in the mail and to my surprise, its just about 14minutes long.
-Positive point(s);
1. Its a memorial to the specific aircrews that lost their lives in this battle. The film, transfered from 8/16mm to video, shows plaques of the names of each aircrew that perished, to include one that survived.
2. It shows (barely) any real film that we are used to today, of in-depth footage of these veterans. Perhaps we are spoiled with todays media involvement, but again, its short.....I mean, I found myself saying, ""Holy %^^&&* thats it"" short!

--Negative point(s);
1. Im still not sure if the original movie by John Ford was supposed to be barely 4 segments on the DvD? The time on this product is anywhere from 12-16 minutes long, Tops! I didn't time it, but Id be surpised if it was longer.

2. I found my self disappointed in that, especially since, with all the other opportunities during and after the battle, John Ford did not add anything to this piece, historically. No added flight training footage of other pilots going through their paces, etc. You got nothing.

3. I did not converse with the company that I purchased it from, to verify if someone goofed on the video transfer to the DVD, and made a mistake with cutting it short, when infact, the transfer to my disc, hit a bump and failed to complete its loading?

--Bottom line?
-If you are looking to keep your library full, for short or long pieces of footage, and feel you need this, then go for it; You can find the names of the lost aircrews of Squadron-8 from other sources. For you to see 1+ minutes each of their plaques, is pointless.
-If you are believing you are going to have at real full-time movie, or at least a good half-hour's worth, you will be fooled.
- I find myself at the personal point of questioniny myself if I should begin re-formatting this disc and using the memory ability of the DVD for other usefull purposes; Thats the level of my disappointment.",1274054400,2,1958,4.5539772727272725

I'm certain that the families of these men were extremely grateful that their government sponsored the making of this memoriam.

8393726,2,B003BKD1YS,"Some thing you might see in family album but hardly a film that gives any understanding to the tragedy. Quality Publishing got hold of the film I would guess and is milking it for all it is worth. I find it to be of little value and rather a insult. I would never buy again from this publisher, hey but that's just me.  There could be people that think its good, I am not one of them.",1418169600,,384,3.987012987012987

It is sad to see these men and know the fate that awaited them, but this very short film is not worth the money",1408838400,2,231,4.155555555555556
8393728,3,B003BKD1YS,Interesting 'sing of the times'.  Only 7 minutes long so I wish it had been longer with more about them and their role in the battle.  Done by John Ford as a tribute for the families.,1408752000,,183,4.055555555555555
