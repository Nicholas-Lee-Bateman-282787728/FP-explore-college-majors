2442472,5,B000BVJ9RI,"Typical early Hee Haw episodes with pretty girls, corny jokes, and lots of picking and grinning. Guests are Hank Williams Jr (Cajun Baby, and I'd Rather Be Gone), Dottie West (Clinging To My Baby's Hand, and Silver Threads And Golden Needles), Merle Haggard ( I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am, and Today I Started Loving You Again), and Loretta Lynn (Fist City, and Dear Uncle Sam).  Buck Owens (Gonna Let The Good Times Roll, Charlie Brown, We Were Made For Each Other, and Love Is Strange with Susan Raye), and Roy Clark (Yesterday When I Was Young, and Meet Mister Callaghan) fill out the musical numbers along with the Hagers (Lodi, and Six Days On The Road) and a Grandpa Jones novelty number.  I wish whoever holds the rights to these shows would release more of them on DVD.  More laughs per hour than what passes for comedy on CBS today.",1408665600,3,847,4.451612903225806

Hee Haw ranked in the top 20 Nationwide. Every Episode is about 50 Minutes Long in Full Color. I never get tired of watching Hee Haw and the Old Style of Country Music with the Original Instruments nothing like today most Artist don't even use the Steel Guitar any more which by the way it goes back to 1922 and earlier. The Hee Haw Collection Episodes are Part of American Musical History and I love to be able to watch them and Collect Them! ..Thank You D.D.",1355788800,2,2709,4.823275862068965
