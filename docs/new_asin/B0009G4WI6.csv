8060192,4,B0009G4WI6,"Not too many Guess Who DVDs out there, so with that being said, this is a pretty good example of their work.  A nice collection of tunes.",1431216000,,137,4.074074074074074
8060193,3,B0009G4WI6,"I'm updating my original comment (below) What was I thinking the first time?
After re-watching this tape I am disappointed in its brevity. And the box states: 118 minutes (2 minutes shy of two hours)! This is misleading as the concert actually runs about One Hour and 18 minutes, what a cheap-shot!
Considering their wealth of material, there are too many definitive songs that were left out. And Burton playing My Own Way to Rock from his solo album - well, it just doesnt belong here. And although Running Back to Saskatoon is a great song it was not recorded during their heyday.
Also, the box states, and six songs never before released, written especially for the reunion. Where are they? And who wants to hear them anyway?
I cant help thinking that the concert was possibly edited for its video release (which makes no sense) But what else is one to think?
Their 2000 CD release, Running Back Thru Canada, was much more inclusive and quite impressive, especially when compared to the video release. It contained 22 songs and ran just short of two hours.
Also lacking on the video - the cameramen didn't give equal time to all the performers. And Gary Petersons drums were (for most of the concert) buried in the background. And no drum solo - this is highway robbery!
I wonder how many bootleg videos are floating around that tell the whole history of this great Canadian band?

My Original Review:
Oh wow! This is great if you're a fan of the original Guess Who. Better than being at their concert! My most favorite band - ever!",1411689600,,1535,4.622710622710622
8060194,5,B0009G4WI6,"I cannot believe that this concert, after all these years, has not be released on DVD???? If this was redone
in HD with great audio it would be a real treat for all Guess Who fans. For those that never saw this concert
it would be well worth even checking out the VHS tape, I guarantee that if you saw it you would be on the list
to try and have this released on DVD. I wish I had the rights to it, I would do it myself. One of their best concerts
in there prime when they were rocking and on fire. Sad that no has the the guts to release a good DVD version
of this concert.",1392422400,3,574,3.831932773109244
8060195,5,B0009G4WI6,"Hi, I just watched this concert ( on a DVD,tranferred from tape or maybe from Laser Disk ?) and this concert is extraordinary !!! I can not understand this concert is not on official dvd yet. Sound and picture is very very very good.
Fans of Guess Who, try to find this concert, you will be very happy to watch it. Dartagnan from Montral.",1287878400,,338,4.296875
8060196,5,B0009G4WI6,"It astounds me that this great concert tape has not been re-issued on DVD. Apparently, someone does not need to make any money.",1269129600,,127,4.565217391304348
8060197,4,B0009G4WI6,"This is a GREAT concert... I saw the tape 20 years ago and lost it somewhere... I really really want to see this come out in DVD.

Why wouldn't they do that?

8060198,5,B0009G4WI6,"First of all, this Concert ""The Guess Who Together Again"" should be released on DVD.  Taped in 1983 before a large live audience in Toronto, this reunion concert features the original band member Burton Cummings, Randy Bachman, Jim Kale and Gary Peterson.  The best way to understand and appreciate the importance of this video is to compare it with the only DVD concert of the Guess Who, ""Running back thru Canada"".  Although Running back thru Canada is an excellent DVD concert, this concert has many more virtues.  1. The band members were all original.  2. They were all very young and in their prime.  3. The audio mix was terrific.  The vocals were well heard and skillfully delivered unlike the first part of the DVD concert.  4. Randy Bachman looked good and performed the BTO songs well. 5. I liked the video editing of the concert.  The Cameras and video systems used were good for the time this concert was taped. The stage lighting was complimentary of the performance and not overbearing like many video concerts. The interviews should have been placed at the end of the tape instead of between the concert footage (my only complaint). The sound on the videotape is linear 2 track Dolby, not HiFi Stereo.  However, the tapes audio sounded good in mono on my VHS player, (a bit noisy). I was fortunate to obtain a good used tape with no flaws.  This performance is a MUST HAVE for any ardent Guess Who fan and is worth the high cost for a used tape.  If any one of influence is out there reading this, PLEASE release this concert on DVD.",1200096000,6,1549,4.592727272727273
