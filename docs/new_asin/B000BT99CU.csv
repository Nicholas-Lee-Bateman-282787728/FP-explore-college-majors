2440137,2,B000BT99CU,"Having watched many telenovelas since 1995, I feel like an expert on them. When i originally watched Huracan when it aired on Univision network, it was shown in the afternoon and it was on for 2 hours a day 5 days a week. I enjoyed it very much so the 2 star rating that i am giving it is not because it is a bad novela because it is actually a good one. I am giving it 2 stars because watching it on dvd, it has been edited so much and the editing has taken away from so much of the story. So much is missing, the music that was originally used has been changed completely. The company that is putting these novelas on dvd, is not doing a good job of actually showing the novelas as gthey were presented originally on tv. I believe that they are being mass produced and the quality is not good. Since Huracan was the first novela that i brought on dvd, and since i was disappointed with it, i will not be buying anymore of these novelas on dvd. I don't think that they should be edited  and that they should be shown on dvd the way that were shown on tv. The novelas are just like our tv shows that they put on dvd except that our tv shows are put out and shown completely on dvd where as the novelas they are putting on dvd are not. They edit them way too much and people are really missing out on alot. So maybe the distribution and production company that puts these novelas on dvd need to be told that they should show each novela unedited and in its entirety.",1157760000,13,1465,4.086805555555555

8092071,3,B000BT99CU,"Huracan (Hurricane  570 minutes)

This one features the prettiest lead actress in a long time! Oceanographer Elena (Anglica Rivera) is a lovely blonde with wide-set brown eyes. Her love interest Ulises (Eduardo Palomo, an actor who died of a heart attack at age 43) looks like a young Don Johnson with a mop of unruly, straggly hair. At least he is (sorta) clean shaven!

The good guys have this disconcerting way of telling the truth. What a concept!

The villainess looks like American actress Ellen Barkin, complete with pushed-in nose and a great body. Make no mistake, she is evil!

The three main issues are gambling addictions, Alzheimer's and environmental problems, the first is a family trait, the next is a tragic accompaniment to aging and the last is due to avaricious businessmen. Our heroine is determined to clean up the local bay; her lover is a sailor who shares her love of the sea; their opponent is a polluting industrialist will do anything to stop them.

Of course we have several rounds of Who's Your Daddy? but eventually things turn out okay. I liked it.",1426464000,,1080,4.779569892473118

I have to amit it's better than most, but still come on.....I also had to have the TV sound turn up so high just to hear it.",1203292800,,300,3.9344262295081966
8092077,5,B000BT99CU,"I am a big novela fan, and just like the others, I felt that I was cheated when I buy the novelas on DVD. So i was surfing the net one day and came upon this website ""Novelas R Us"" which contains complete novelas randing from like 15 to 40 DVD's.  I just bought Corazon Salvaje and am going to wait a little while to buy this one. I can't wait!! It was only like 65 bucks too (although some shorter ones cost less and the longer ones a little more).",1175817600,5,449,3.934065934065934
