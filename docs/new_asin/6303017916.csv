7834155,3,6303017916,"The previous reviewer appears to have watched Peter Brook's version of the Mahabharata, which was an excellent, multinational production - theatrical, epic, spare, poetic, rendered in quiet, nearly monochromatic hues and with often silent backgrounds, interspersed with periods of hauntingly beautiful music. This is totally unlike the Chopra & Chopra directed Hindi version.
If your American or European, stick with Peter Brook's version first (now available on DVD), then try the other versions -- or read William Buck's translation/rendition.",1035849600,23,545,5.9113924050632916
