8017650,3,B0001XANX0,"Capulina Speedy Gonzalez(1970) isn't high art, but it wins points just for being fun. Nowadays, Mexico's film industry isn't as active as it used to be. By the way, Warner Brothers' cartoon character Speedy Gonzalez doesn't appear in one frame of this film. Capulina(Gaspar Henaine) is framed for robbing a bank; he must help the Sheriff find the real thieves. When Capulina eats bread with hot peppers, he runs around Benny Hill-style! Lovely, Mexican comic actress Leonorilda Ochoa(La Alegria De Vivir) plays Capulina's love interest. There's no extras on this DVD and it abruptly ends as soon as ""Fin"" appears on the screen. This western-comedy was made in the same vein as Blazing Saddles(1974), but it's nowhere as vulgar. This film is in Mexican Spanish with no subtitles. The music score is quite good. Capulina Speedy Gonzalez is a fun way to kill 90 minutes if you're a Mexican Film Buff.",1315699200,,897,4.947019867549669
