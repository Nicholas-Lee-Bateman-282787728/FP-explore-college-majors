6208582,5,B00HUAGXY0,"Not your ordinary nature film. Extraordinary footage of one of Ireland's prized assets. The beauty of it, is in the effort to keep this amazing river IN its wild and pristine state.  It makes you wonder, if this was what our mighty Columbia would look today had it
not been compromised by our Corp of Engineers in the early twentieth century.  It is an awesome documentary  worthy of a gift to
my pilot son who landed there in a private jet and first drew my attention to the beauty and importance of this Irish jewell.  This awesome film aired just a week after he'd been there to my huge benefit.",1406592000,4,598,4.409090909090909

6208584,5,B00HUAGXY0,"The Shannon is Ireland's greatest geographical landmark, a wild flower meadows, the longest river, 200 miles long that divides Ireland in two, with the wider west and gentler east trough a huge palette of rural landscapes where on little-known backwaters, Ireland's wild animals and plants thrive as almost nowhere else with such a great sense of history and signs of Ireland's past all over this great water system with many castle ruins and natural beauty unmatched anywhere.

John Murray, the director has done a superb job of presenting the beauty of Shannon in a format that feels different. It is more like still photography. Each frame is done so beautifully with so many colorful plants, animals and natural background that I had to freeze many frames and playback time after time. It was difficult not to compare or at least be aware of John Stafford-Johnson's superb presentation as a single soul who journeyed through the Shannon in a canoe while stopping and facing the camera many times with my favorite wildlife presenter David Attenborough. This documentary was produced with the participation of Irish Government tax incentives for PBS Nature program and hope to see more documentaries from these talented individuals. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1404086400,7,1255,5.182266009852217
6208585,5,B00HUAGXY0,"I agree with the review above, just beautiful and soothing, insightful narration.. The photography stunning, I plan to order it",1394755200,2,127,5.4
6208586,5,B00HUAGXY0,"Without a doubt, this is among the most beautiful and breathtaking nature documentaries I've ever seen. The photography, including underwater and close-up, was stunning. The show's host, who spent a year living on the river, is vastly knowledgeable about the flora and fauna of the area, and listening to his calm and kindly commentary is a balm to the soul. His love for the river and its denizens is evident, and you feel transported to his side as he quietly paddles along in his canoe pointing out the treasures of the river.

Although the disc has not yet been released, I am absolutely going to order it now to be first in line to acquire this gem.",1393459200,18,654,4.589743589743589

6208619,5,B00HUAGXY0,"Love this mellow, introspective, beautiful show on the Shannon. The host is informative and entertaining. He added a strong element of history of the area to the show and appears to be a pleasant fellow and a perfect river guide. I appreciated the information about how the Shannon has changed in recent years, and the disappearance of wildlife is of great concern. An excellent show that can appeal to anyone regardless knowledge or interest in Ireland.",1444521600,3,454,4.9868421052631575

6208624,5,B00HUAGXY0,"The program Nature on public TV seldom disappoints.  It almost uniformly delivers beautiful photography, and an intimate look into the life of what it explores.  That said, this program is spectacular.  I don't often purchase nature documentaries but made the decision to buy the DVD halfway through the program.  The narrator, John Stafford-Johnson, is Irish and spent a year on Ireland's Shannon River to get to know her and present her beauty to us.  His voice is soothing and the pace of the narration is soft and slow as he paddles down the river pointing out different features and creatures.  John was accompanied by a gifted photographer(s) that managed to show us just how beautiful the river is.  The Shannon is truly unspoiled and I hope this program inspires the Irish to continue to preserve her that way.  What a treasure. This piece is like a love poem to Ireland, a meditation on beauty.",1438732800,6,903,4.818181818181818

6208642,5,B00HUAGXY0,An account of a canoe trip down Ireland's Shannon River from Spring to Winter. What makes it extra enjoyable is the narration delivered by an Irish naturist who describes the comings and goings of the fauner and flaura with such tenderness.
