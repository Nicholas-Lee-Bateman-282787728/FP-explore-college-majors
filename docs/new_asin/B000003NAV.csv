7903158,5,B000003NAV,"This is a wonderful, enchanting video, complete with a great narration and music. The pace is relaxed, and the characters are so charming that kids and adults are gently drawn into the story.
This video has a European feeling to it, in part because the narrator, Peter Ustinov, has such a wonderful accent.
My 3 year old son thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I highly recommend it to parents who are eager to get away from the stereotypical Disney characters and the fast paced cartoon videos that are so prevalent today.",992908800,14,522,4.747252747252747
