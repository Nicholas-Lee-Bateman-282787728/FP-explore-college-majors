6268294,3,B00IKM5MIA,"This film has dramatic music and dark shadows associated with the prospect of coming into contact with ones doppelganger, like, it's supposed to be forbidden, but couldn't it be fun too?  An interesting study about how easily subliminal images can be snuck into media and then forgotten (is this supposed to be a drama or War of the Worlds?, oh it's a drama, no, it's sci fi), so it could be thought of as being genre bending.  Isabella Rosellini's character added dramatic convincingness to the film, which collapses into, like, what did I just see?, with an uncomfortable giggle, in the end.  I wonder what she must have been thinking while she was reading her lines?  Extra credit for, a month later I am still thinking about this film!

6268296,3,B00IKM5MIA,"Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal ) is an insecure boring History Professor who lectures on ways governments control us. His world lacks color and the backgrounds are symbolically drab. He has a hot girlfriend (Mlanie Laurent) that he can't seem to satisfy. Upon watching a locally made film he sees his double. He seeks him out only to freak out upon meeting. Why? I don't know, but they both did. Mom (Isabella Rossellini) seems to know something but pretends she doesn't. Adam is her only child.

There is also the symbolism of the weird opening scene involving a number of men looking at a nude masturbating woman and a big spider. There is also a large spider looming over the city where wires and broken windshields look like a web which turns a mystery thriller into a sci-fi film.i.e This is either an odd art film filled with symbolism or science fiction...or both.

Or it could be that the guy is simply bonkers living a double life which makes the whole film stupid and a waste of time.

6268297,5,B00IKM5MIA,"There are very few actors that can continue to surprise me in every role they take on, reinventing themselves each time they're on screen, and Jake Gyllenhaal is nearing the top of that list. The name alone may not be something you recognize, but you've probably seen him as the exhilarating lead in ""Source Code"" and several other films like ""End of Watch"" and last year's ""Prisoners"". He's one of the most underrated people in Hollywood, and almost always provides an impeccable performance that won't let you forget his face. His latest part in the mind-bending mystery `Enemy' does just the same, and he proves once again how spectacular he can be.

This slow burning thriller follows a depressed history professor named Adam (Gyllenhaal) who unexpectedly, while watching a movie, discovers an actor who could be his twin. On a mission to meet this man, he stalks, and eventually finds him. We see their lives quickly become intertwined, even if it may not be in the greatest of ways. Intriguing and ultimately fascinating, this is one of the most interesting and odd movies of the year.

It certainly isn't for everyone, with a `love it or hate it' type of response, but I was totally engaged and couldn't take my eyes off of it. It may not be universally loved, but I found it to be a daring movie that needs to be watched more than once to completely grasp.

This film was made for patient people who prefer eerie and surreal over explosions. Think Hitchcock meets David Lynch or Cronenberg, while perhaps dipping a toe in Bergman's Persona. Virtually every second oozes menace and tension. Gyllenhall is terrific in the dual roles.

I defy anyone not to jump at the final shot--one of the most startling and enigmatic I've ever seen. When I saw it in the theater, the entire audiece gasped. What does it mean? Debate it with those you see it with.",1396051200,17,765,4.617647058823529

Now my review: Have you ever been told you have a doppelgnger (someone who looks exactly like you)? I have.... But I have never been motivated to investigate, unlike our hero in this chaotic Mystery/Thriller, where we see a glum history professor become fixated on meeting his dynamic double after he spots him in a movie.

Based on the novel by the late Jos Saramago and directed by Canadian Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners""), our R-rated story has nudity, sweaty bodies and a car crash, but no gunshots, blowie uppie stuff or much profanity.

Here are some of the cast members:
  * Jake Gyllenhaal (""Prisoners"") is both the professor and the actor. Give this guy some points: his physical bearing is very different, based on which character he is playing. I was impressed.
  * Mlanie Lauren (""Inglorious Basterds"") is the professor's girlfriend, far more patient with his moods than I would expect.
  * Sarah Gadon (Lots of TV) is the actor's porcelain-skinned, very pregnant wife. She seems uncommonly smart.
  * Isabella Rossellini (""Infamous"") may or may not be the professor's real mother.

Shot back-to-back with the filming of ""Prisoners"" this pretentious work of ""Art"" was off-putting to me from the beginning. It had gloomy lighting and mystifying relationships, plus unexplained weeping. These were compounded by two unlikable characters, each with an identical scar on his torso...which is never explained.

The music, photography and production design all send portentous signals that all is not as it seems, particularly when the spider theme keeps showing up. The abrupt ending felt to me like a Shaggy Dog joke, you know, no punch line...",1395187200,5,1921,5.2182410423452765

6268303,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Most people disliked this film. It is based on a 336-page novel by the 1998 Nobel Prize Winner for Literature Jose Saramago. The novel is called The Double. Saramago's books cause readers to think, frequently, as in this film version of the novel, there is much that is not really clear, especially the ending, so it is not surprising that most viewers disliked it. The Boston Globe called the novel ""a wonderful twisted meditation on identity and individuality."" I did not yet read the book, but this characterization could apply to the film. I ordered the book.
The film is about a college history professor who is bored with life, with the repetitions of his same lectures to different classes, with marking papers, with same sex with a girlfriend, and more. We see him brooding often. Then he happens to see a movie video in which there is a bit player who looks exactly like him. He becomes obsessed thinking about the actor. He imagines movie scenes, including one with a giant spider. He decides to visit him. He finds that he is married to a pregnant wife. The two decide to switch roles for a night. Each joining the others woman.
My interpretation of the film is based on the following: (1) The two men are identical in every way, including a large scar along their backs inflicted after birth. This is impossible. (2) Both like blueberries a lot. (3) The actor tells his wife that someone told him about the value of organic blueberries, and we see in another scene the professors mother speaking to him about blueberries. (4) The history professors mother tells him that he is her only son. (5) The professor is so board that he needs to get out of himself. (6) The bit players wife complains that he is seeing another woman. (7) The bit players wife tells asks him how teaching is and, at another time, tells him his mother called and wants to speak to him. (8) In the movies final scene, he sees the giant spider he thought about before he visited the actor.
In view of these facts, I think the two men are the one man living two lives.(9) The film also hints at the two lives when we see the history professor giving the same lecture twice and saying that the philosopher Hegel said that everyone has a repetition of their experiences and Karl Marx commented that the first time is good but the second time is a farce.",1522108800,2,2333,4.530805687203792

This isn't a movie you can just watch. You have to care enough about art in general that you want to understand it. Like Eternal Sunshine, it's confusing and the viewer is left with loose ends they need to tie up themselves.

6268321,4,B00IKM5MIA,"This movie is based on the surrealist novel ""The Double"" by Jose Saramago.

The movie is largely minimal and mundane in its presentation, but it intensely focuses on Jake Gyllenhaal's unraveling. The film is sprinkled with dream sequences that jar one's complacency with the underlying horror which is punctuated abruptly at the end.

And despite the bizarre, dreamlike quality there are actual concrete and tangible clues to the mystery if you catch them. I got the central mystery but some of the symbolism I didn't understand at first. And I had no idea what that insane but awesome ending meant but I got the story and the themes they were presenting. Then I watched the bonus features and that enlightened things even further, then read some more stuff online and needless to say I feel like I have a pretty good handle on everything Enemy by now.

I love movies that make me want to do that. That make me want to dig in and learn everything I can about them. And this mystery can be proven with one true answer. I love those mysteries. I don't cotton to that David Lynch bs where nothing makes any sense and even he doesn't know what the real answer is. (Although Raymond Chandler famously had no idea when asked who killed the chauffeur in The Big Sleep even though he wrote it.)

This is a great movie and I have no idea how so many people could give it bad reviews. They must have terrible taste. The performances were great, the cinematography, the music all helped to convey that building tension and feeling of dread.",1501977600,3,1320,4.423868312757202

6268329,5,B00IKM5MIA,"There are some movies you can't imagine someone not liking and certainly couldn't dream it would generate dislike in mass. I feel that is the case with ""Enemy."" A superb film from top to bottom. Paced perfectly, top notch acting, incredibly told story, what's not to love? I think people really prefer to be able to predict to a large degree what will happen. They don't want to be uncomfortable. Ever watch a movie with someone that asks questions to what is going on and you don't know either nor possibly could know? That's what I mean. This movie is not for those folks. It is for those with patience. It is for those who want to be taken on a ride and get enough out of it simply from that and not necessarily from a great twist ending or moral to the story (as important as that is and it is often important). Hats off to Villeneuve and his actors! Truly excellent work.
As a side: ""Enemy"" gave me an insight into the nature of many and an insight into life. Some are not just impatient, they don't just want answers, they want a full grasp of a story at all times. They don't want to lose control over their grasp of a narrative. I think these people (not all people that didn't like ""Enemy"") are ultimately impatient and have a false sense of control over many elements of their own lives. There have been stories about people on sinking ships that can't take action. They have to be led or they will sit there and drown in shock. I wonder if that is the type of person that would dislike this kind of movie; that they have to be led by the nose with full clarity. I want to reiterate that I don't believe that's all people that didn't like this movie. I think taking the time to think through a film like this, to let go and just allow yourself to experience something out of your cerebral grasp and control could help generally in life. We sometimes should take actions that the end result of which may be uncertain. Are we patient enough to take risks like this? To trust that while we may not know every step of the way is the clear, right choice?",1497744000,2,2059,4.295629820051414

DV has directed another film in a closet full of them at this point, and quite honestly I really hope his Blade Runner sequel succeeds because he has the talent to make it happen.

What does not surprise me at all I guess are the tepid and inane reviews by Amazon reviewers, who absolutely need most things spoon fed to them. Look, the whole point of this film was not to give you a history lesson, to outright make you believe in any one thing, or to control your emotions and wrap things up in a tidy soap opera ending. It's symbolism. The film leaves things open-ended for a reason. If you were given reasons and crucial points of exposition that explained everything it would totally ruin the entire film.

I think it speaks more to this generation of ""kids"" than anything else.... in that people cannot be bothered to think beyond the first line of sight anymore. Ironically, the whole film has flashes of the theme of dictatorships and control that seem to explain what is going on if only people would, you know, control their attention spans for a quick moment or stop and think about what is actually going on before just giving up and in to their tendencies to be displeased on first sight of a problem. But no, a one star review and waste of time it is. Back to Hunger Games and comic book films!

Enemy is open ended in that you can put your own thoughts and ideas onto its symbolism, though, there are distinct lines of understanding that beckon you to peruse their depths. There are ideas about spiders, women, sex, twins, mythology, government, et cetera. You are never too sure what exactly is going on, but the film encourages you to think a little bit, take in its source material, and then with the absurdly gorgeous direction and score you have something to ponder for a couple hours.

Enemy probably doesn't quite live up to its ambitions in that it leaves a few too many things left unsaid, and that missing exposition or even symbolism does leave a bit of a hole in the film's complex, but it still is a great little indie that is way too underrated on this site. There are many themes about control in this film, and one only has to go so far to see those concepts played out in intelligent and creative ways within the short running time here. I never once looked at the time in a hurry while watching this. It's 90 minutes for god's sake, and the director is easily one of the most talented guys in the film business.

As I said this is a quality film. I have no idea whatsoever why it is sitting below three stars. People in general have poor taste when it comes to difficult films. The Bluray looks very good for an indie and is shot in wondrously minimalist yet artful way typical of the director's other films. Totally recommended.",1497398400,,2931,4.471028037383178
6268334,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Enemy's ending blew my mind. I haven't been this rocked by a conclusion since the Prestige, one of my fave films of all time. That being said, Enemy is not a perfect movie like The Prestige. But it is one heck of a thinking person's film, especially after the film is over. Be warned: if you're not interested in metaphorical storytelling and puzzles, this isn't the film for you. I nearly hated it until I researched the ending and read some of the many theories about the story.

Is it about clones, twins, or multiple personalities? There's evidence to support any of such theories, but the spiders are the main thing that you need to focus on. Jake Gyllenhaal has been a role with his choice of roles, and this is perhaps his best yet. I chose this film because of my appreciation for  Dennis Villenauve's work. This is his most challenging film, but it's well worth the effort of viewing and wrestling with the meaning of the film, which doesn't give you any direct answers. You have to put the puzzle together and come out with your own understanding. (The internet helps, lol)

Denis Villeneuve layers his film with meaning.

A film where the emphasis, is pretty much, of neurosis and fear. This is the adaptation of Jos Saramagos 2002 novel O Homem Duplicado: The Duplicated Man. This is a striking inquiry into the human condition. A thematically opulent psychosomatic thriller, which examines identity, accountability, longing and sets out to befuddle and puzzle.

Jake Gyllenhaal gives the film, a dual performance as both Adam and Anthony: Adam a disheartened history lecturer in Toronto. Who is a rather, crumpled history lecturer Adam, he happens upon and spots his exact double in a film. Thus his attention shifts to seeking out this physical doppelgnger, and he pushes aside his commitments and relationship troubles. Jake Gyllenhaal also stars as Anthony - a confident actor who is expecting his first child. Mlanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon play the women in their lives.

Adam and Anthonys initial encounter gives rise to antagonism, fear, a kind of reciprocally agreed form of nervous breakdown, but also an electrifying sense of opportunity, to escape from ones individuality. Somewhat reminiscent of David Cronenbergs Dead Ringers here. There maybe even a touch of Roal'd Dahls narratives from his novel Switch Bitch and one of the short stories called ""The Great Switcheroo"". For the audience, this is a dreamlike voyage, into the psyche of a man who is cracking under the pressure of his reality. For it appears that he fears for his future. Adam lives a lonely, yellow-tinged existence in a smoggy Toronto, his fractured disposition pushing him closer to the abyss as he finds himself unable to control his compulsions.

Throughout the played out the narrative - a spider appears, in one form or another, copious times and proves a problematic keynote open to explanation, however, on one level represents a fear of fatherhood. There are coolly effective moments when Villeneuve declines to make it clear which double we are watching and whose memories and fears we are experiencing. He scrutinizes the modern world and the increasing disconnect brought about by new technology. This then communicates these ideas, via an array of gloomy framed visuals and music. With the overbearing high rises of Toronto combined with the sedate, if not mournful score conveys such forceful disorder and dread that it is enough to leave it resonating in your head post-viewing.

The final shot is bizarre and maybe an allegory, but for what.",1486252800,,2488,5.158808933002481

6268366,3,B00IKM5MIA,"If you are someone who likes to talk about a movie with a companion after youve watched itand who doesntthis ones for you.  One of todays best directors, Denis Villeneuve managed to squeeze this movie in between the acclaimed Prisoners and Sicario. It was one of those films that hit theaters and on demand at the same time.  I remember trailers suggesting some kind of thriller involving Jake Gyllenhaal playing 2 characters.

We first see him as Adam, a rumpled history professor.  Theres something unsavory about him but we cant put our finger on it.  He lives in a bare apartment and when hes not working, hes bonking a beautiful girl named Mary (Melanie Laurent).  That is after hes attended one of those sleazy private clubs where an assortment of perverted men watch naked women walk around impaling tarantulas with their spike heels.  Adam spends much of his time at work in a seeming daze.  While eating his lunch one day, an associate suggests a film he might want to watch.

Although Adam doesnt usual watch movies he stops at a DVD rental store and finds the movie, takes it home and watches.  Hes more into watching the movie than Mary, who is urging him to come to bed.  But Mary doesnt live with him so she bolts.  Although Adam doesnt seem particularly interested in the movie, he pauses on a scene where a bit actor playing a bellhop, billed as Anthony St. Claire (also Gyllenhaal), looks exactly like him.  Intrigued, Adam tracks him down, calling him only to have the phone answered by his 6-month pregnant wife, Helen (Sarah Gadon).  She thinks it is Adam playing a trick on her.  Isabella Rossellini plays the mother and through her Villeneuve and screenwriter, Javier Gullon drop little tidbits that you might want to park in your brain somewhere.

This is one of those movies that is more of a mystery than anything else, offering up more than one possibility.  And while I think I caught on fairly early, Im still uncertain as to what it all adds up to, or if I care.  Im not even sure the filmmakers know.  The actors in a supplement, suggest they didn't either.  So I feel a little better not having tied it all up in a nice package.  Id like to think I could figure it all out with another viewing but once was enough.",1480723200,,2245,4.548628428927681

The DVD has a short in which the director and actors talk about the making of the film, and it's abundantly clear why the film is so bad. They had no idea what they were doing. They were trying to create the story while they were shooting. As a result the movie wanders from scene to scene without rhyme or reason, with story ideas only loosely connected. Nothing is revealed or explained. The doppelganger idea can be compelling in the right hands. Look at Malle's version of Poe's William Wilson. Or Cronenberg's Dead Ringers.

I admit, I had no idea what was going on until I watched that video. But that's because the movie itself isn't supposed to flat out explain what's going on. That's not the point.
This is a film that demands your attention and provokes actual thought and discussion. If you would rather just watch a movie to turn your brain off and pass the time, this is not for you, but that doesn't make this a bad film, and you shouldn't mark it as such.",1472860800,26,733,4.437037037037037

6268383,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Enemy is an enigma of a film in the best of ways. Films like this are the reasons I love watching movies. I adore films that make you think and form theories about the plot. Speaking of the plot, this movie has such an intriguing and baffling narrative that warrants multiple viewing's to understand the metaphorical imagery and symbolic meanings and themes. Regardless the basic plot is that Jake Gyllenhall's character sees a duplicate copy of himself in a movie he rents from the local movie store. Then, what follows is a tale of duplicity and identity crisis and romantic dilemmas (watch the film and you will understand why). Jake Gyllenhall's portrayal is absolutely transformative in this film that before Nightcrawler stole the show for me deserved an Oscar nom. His mannerisms from his oneself to his other self is very subtle and fascinating in terms of acting prowess. Now let's talk about the cinematography, well it is a interesting color pallette that sets the tone for this movie that feels almost dreamlike in a sense. Then there's the visionary of this film: Dennis Villenauve. His directing style is so unconventional and unique that really propels this film to a higher standard of quality. Now the only con I can say is that there were aspects of the film that were a bit slow for me and it took a while for the film to hook me. But once I saw the double of Jake then i was sold and transfixed to the screen. Now this film is not for your average moviegoer. This will confuse and baffle you to the point of frustration. Cretain scene's that happen will give you a WTF question circling your head. Regardless, this film is worth watching if you like films that challenge you and give you questions while subtly laying answers through imagery and meticulous filmmaking.

The cast signed a confidentiality agreement that keeps them from talking about/explaining the purpose of the spiders throughout the film, but I am convinced that the spiders have no purpose and that the directors, writers, etc. simply wanted something random in the movie to troll audiences with. I think they simply wanted a place on the list of films that leave the audience wondering ""what did the ending mean?!"" However, unlike most of the other films on said list, the ending of this film likely had no relevant meaning at all. I am a Jake Gyllenhaal fan, but I certainly won't be watching this movie again.

6268646,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Great acting by Gyllenhaal(as always). Very few characters in this movie so you really get to see him shine through every minute. This movie is a puzzle. Things at the movies start are actually at the end in a linear timeline and things at the end are really the start. You have to piece it together. You can do that by reading explanation articles like googling ""Enemy Gyllenhall explained"" or just watch the movie multiple times(twice in a row helps)

I understand that is more of a commitment than some would want but, really I felt its worth it. POS movies with B acting like ""Gods not Dead"" get 5* and require you to read a 1000 page book and suspend reality to even have a chance at enjoying. So really this isn't so bad and the payoff is there at the end. This movie will make you think and I enjoyed pondering on it after watching.",1466812800,,839,4.343949044585988

It is very eerie because the character developments start to play off psychology, and I don't know if it is because I am a writer or because I have had many experiences but I got a very creepy feeling watching this.

SPOILER:
FOR THOSE OF YOU CONFUSED BY THE MOVIE (BELIEVE ME I WAS CONFUSED TOO):  I looked it up and according to Denis Villeneuve, the director, the movie is about Adam/Anthony facing his decisions through the eyes of his subconscious.

Unfortunately it was a slow going movie that never built up to anything other than a strange ending that made ZERO sense. The whole movie was a waste of my time and a big disappointment.

I typically really love movies that require thought. I didn't mind that it was slow going until the end happened. I actually fully understand what the movie was trying to do, but it could have been done in almost any other way with a different ending that would have left me with leaving this with 4 stars instead of 2.

I read the reviews without spoilers prior to watching this. What I can tell you is even if you are the type to like movies that require thought this still may be a complete waste of your time. A different ending could have changed my rating by 2 stars.

What got the two stars was the acting and the plot idea only.",1464566400,,915,4.1875

The ludicrous plot that worked on the page in the novel, doesn't amount to much on screen beyond its inherent gimmickry. It may have worked better as a short film.",1459641600,,464,5.118421052631579

6270044,5,B00IKM5MIA,"This is a pretty interesting movie. Jake Gykllenhaal was great as usual and I don't even have to discuss about it bacause he is already great before so many times.
It is Melanie Laurent I want to talk a little about. I first saw her from French film <Don't Worry, I'm Fine>(2006) When I saw that film, I thought that I found out the next Sophie Marceau or Isabelle Adjani. But after that movie she shot two more in France then she went to hollywood right away which is sad. She has so many things to show in her country, why? She could have been a great actress in France! Then she started all over again. Small rolls, small rolls. The thing is Even after the success of the movie <Now you see Me> she decided to be in this small roll from the film <ENEMY>
The thing that I even can't understand is, although I know that European actresses don't care about nudity at all, she decided to be naked in the bed scene. The more sad thing was the roll she was in was something that any actress can do. It's not a complicated roll. It was such a simple roll.

Anyway, back to the film. The film is about a professor who found out that during watching a film, he saw this unknown actor who is totally identical with himself and begins to search him. He happens to call his house and he talks to his wife. The wife thought that the one who is calling is her husbad. Meaning the professor even has the same voice with the actor. The professor finally talks with the actor.
The identical guy wanted to meet him and they finally meet.
But when they meet, the professor freaks out and ran away.
Now the actor guy searches the professor from the website and calls him again. He blakcmails him that you might have raped my pregnant wife which is kind of absurd. Then they decided to exchange their home. Now this part is also very odd and not understandable too.
The professor who went to the house where the pregnant wife is living, he creies and be nice to the lady.
But it is the actor who is in trouble who went to the hotel with the girlfriend of the professor. During the intercourse, the girfriend found out the ring mark from his finger and freaks out that he is not his boyfriend.
The story ends with the giant spider appears in the pregnant wife's house. Which is kind of metaphor of some kind of mental breakdown or something.
The story is kind of interesting and it follows a story Doppelgenger I think.
Gykenhaal was very interesting in his both rolls and I admit that very well.
I am very sad as I told you before that Melanie Laurent was wasted for nothing.
She should have been more careful choosing the roll in new movies in Hollywood.",1455753600,,2637,4.305835010060362

I read reviews prior to watching that spoke of the director's vision, depth of concept, imagery, blah, blah, blah.  I found it to be incredibly slow to establish anything, uninteligible as to what the plot even was for most, if not all of the film, and an absolute bizarre ending that explained nothing (or did it, who the hell knows).

6270550,3,B00IKM5MIA,"Jake Gyllenhaal does not disappoint, but the film itself is as bleak and impenetrable as the colorless haze that surrounds most scenes. Gyllenhaal aptly delivers two identical, yet clearly distinguishable characters -- each with his own walk, talk, posture and wardrobe. But is he two men or two facets of the same man? If you stick through this movie for answers, you won't find any definitive ones. Having gone to the Internet to make some sense of this strange story, some (but not all) of the answers seem to be there -- still open to interpretation. This is one of the rare movies that I would have rather watched having read the spoilers first. Some fans recommended a second viewing to better appreciate the subtle clues sprinkled throughout, with the possible knowledge of what is real or fantasy, or what the heck might be going on -- but for me, it was just too depressing to experience twice. Some called this a masterpiece, which must be what drew Gyllanhall to the project. To each his own.",1453593600,2,1003,4.704545454545454

6270711,5,B00IKM5MIA,"I found ""Enemy"", fascinating, it reminded me of a lot of Roman Polanski's work, filmed in an almost hyper-realistic style, but at the same time including many disturbing  surreal images.  To film watchers who have grown accustom to and expect the meaning of a film spoon fed to them, it probably won't appeal to them, because the film requires an active interpretation by the film watcher.  To anyone that has had a kind of identity crisis, those people will probably relate to it right away.  If you look at the film literally you will try to see the film in terms of clones, , or identical twins, it  probably won't appeal to you.  But if you look at it in terms of what makes a person a person, is it personality, achievement, physical appearance etc.? Or people who have wondered about their own personalities, for example, ever wonder about having an alter ego?  The film reminded me of Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"", and ""The Tenant"" 1976, or even 2010's ""Black Swan"", not directed by  Polanski. If you have everbeen told by someone, ""I swear you have a double"", might have experienced some disturbing moments thinking about it.  The film requires one to puzzle out what is happening, in order to arrive at a meaning, and this to me , is far more satisfying  then when one is  told that meaning.  The performances in the film are all superb.  I highly recommend this fascinating, if disturbing thriller.",1451692800,,1408,4.697959183673469

Because I nodded off, I didn't get to see how the story played out and what the outcome was.  The only great scene I remember was the car crash towards the end of the movie.  It looked very real and totally destroyed the car and the people in it.  Seriously, one of the best car crashes I've seen.

The only thing I really liked was the use of a color lens filter that gave the movie great atmosphere and mood.  A great low budget way to enhance the look of the film.

The best part of this film for me is actually the conversations that take place to analyze it after you've watched it. It brings the film to life in so many different ways because so many different people will have their unique perspective to bring to the table to interpret its events and you can't really deny most people's interpretations. The most interesting follow up activity I found was to try to reconstruct the actual linear timeline of the film. I think the Director put a lot of deliberate holes in the plot so that there could be many different possibilities of how the timeline might have actually played out but it keeps you questioning how many of the events actually took place in reality versus the main character's imagination. Was Adam the primary character and Anthony the split personality? Or was Adam the split personality? Or was Adam or Anthony just a complete figment of imagination? This is a film that I'll guess is easily overlooked because the depth of the narrative passes you by so quickly on a first viewing. However, if you read and like film or took a college film class that you liked, you really should check this out. The overall message may not be so uplifting but it's an amazing film to analyze.",1446854400,,1399,4.622489959839357

WOWmy life explained.

On a more serious noteat minute 6:00 there's a great diatribe about ""control"" and its recurrence in civilisation. This meme is aptly expressed throughout the film in the sterile concrete images that envelop the human protagonists.

Enemy has that in spades.  But, as evidenced by the preponderance of 1-star reviews here, I agree that it goes too far in this respect. Theres a difference between lacing a story with double meaning and thoroughly confusing and confounding the viewer, especially with an overly abrupt, Kafka-esque ending that doesnt do justice to what up until then has been a decent movie.

Bright spots are the acting, pacing and cinematography. Filmed in yellow, grainy light, the city of Toronto comes across as an otherworldly, dystopian void. But these couple of things aren't enough to rescue this absurdity of a movie.",1444867200,,754,5.016

Unlike most of his other films, this one is not mainstream narrative cinema. If you're expecting anything like Prisoners, the movie he released just before this one, it's not. It is surreal and abstract. One of the critic's reviews I read called it Kafka-esque. I would call it Cronenberg-esque or perhaps Lynch-esque. If you don't like David Cronenberg's or David Lynch's films you probably won't like this one.

6271893,5,B00IKM5MIA,"This is not a traditional film. Those words right there dismantle pretty much every negative review on here. This film was great, allow me to give you a few reason why I loved this film.

I'll spare you the description, as you're most likely reading the comments as the movies desription sounded interesting to you. But Jake Gyllenhaal plays two characters, BRILLIANTLY. He has been one of my favorite actors for a while now, and his performance in this only confirms my views.

However you can't have a good character without good writing, and the writing in this is absolutely top teir. The dialogue all contain clues to what's going on, the characters are beautifully imagined and the world is magnificent, once again, littered with clues to help explain the plot.

Camera work was great, each angle told a story that further explains what direction the story is headed. The lighting was excellent as well, with the color they made the film, everything blended so well and took on a vibe of its own.

Music was well paced, adding a feeling of dread to many of the scenes

This director is in a league of his own, all of the respect goes to this man and his vision.

Now please, if you haven't seen this film, avoid all spoilers, as the most important scene of the movie may be spoiled, and if it's taken from you, there is no getting it back.

I highly recommend checking this out, just keep in mind, the story won't present itself to you, you have some thinking to do, but that's half the fun!",1443657600,,1497,4.522222222222222

It definitely was trying to show that we are many different people, and we show different ""faces"" depending on who we are dealing with throughout our lives. I found the music to be somewhat annoying. I didn't might the drums so much but the creepy sexual undertones in an Ingmar Bergman style along with the 40's esc dramatic - and I might add ""irritating"" music. The switching to creepy black, and white; as well as the image of spiders also reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's style of cinematography. The scenes in which the characters didn't ""turn the damn lights on"" kind of bugged me. Again, the Director may have intentionally done this to show that sometimes we ourselves are not even aware of these different layers within our personality's.

And there were plenty of red herrings in the beginning to throw you off. There's no big reveal either, so you have to go look up explanations on the internet for everything to click at the end if you miss things.

Jake Gyllenhaal held the movie up where the direction failed. He was believable as two different persons, whether past/present self, present/past self (wink*) or aware/institutionalized self and vice versa. Do you like the blueberries or is it just that they told you that you should like it? Unfortunately the way in which the two main personas were supposed to be viewed wasn't just through his performance but also through his supporting cast members and I'm not sure if I didn't like their acting or if I didn't like the way they were directed to act but it was lacking, and morose. Did the atmosphere change with viewpoints? Hard to say since most of the movie seems dully brushed in greyed skylines and colourless ambiance with an occasional splash of darkened shots where you have to try to figure out what's happening because the lighting is terrible. I really liked the tension (will the doppelgangers actually meet?) and the constant questioning that happens throughout the movie which kept me interested (why is he so scared of meeting himself after being excited? why isn't he scared of meeting himself after being angry?). But I could have done without the prolonged shots (do we really need to see someone walk down a parking ramp, turn on the ramp, walk down some more?) and didn't need to be exposed to the pitiable psyche that required the addition of spiders (the larger web of control spanning the city,the localized control from your wife/mother/girlfriend or because the director has a problem regarding women-""Am I a man?"" I don't know, but you won't get the answer you want by screaming at someone).Per amazon 3 stars is okay, 5 stars I loved it. Meh, I liked it, so 4 stars it is.",1439424000,,1923,4.809667673716012

The direction is ridiculous, over-the-top, overdramatic. The music is inappropriately suspenseful through the WHOLE film, when nothing remotely suspenseful is happening (they can be walking down the street or eating or getting dressed). The dread and terror of the characters when they first become aware of each other is ridiculous. No one acts like this.

6273186,1,B00IKM5MIA,"On occasion an ambiguous ending serves the narrative and offers a conclusion that to go all film school, satisfies both sides of the dialectic. It's a reason why people endlessly debate the Usual Suspects or Inception, or several other films well into 5 star territory. Suffice it to say that this is not one of those films. In film, the establishing shot of the movie is often mirrored by the closing short, but because the characters have undergone a transformation, the final shot has a different meaning. While not venturing into spoiler land, suppose this film begins with a shot of a ""turnip"" and closes with a shot of a giant ""turnip.""

6273410,1,B00IKM5MIA,"Wow, I can't believe some people like this movie. Worst writing EVAR!!!!!

I'm serious.

1) Why is the guy freaked out? No real person would freak out. They'd be like ""OMG. That guy looks just like me. I've got to go say hi!"" and they'd strike up a conversation.  Maybe they just look alike. Maybe they'd were separated at birth with some deep family secret. But regardless no one would be freaked out

2) Why is the wife freaked out? Again zero reason, zero believability.  I once saw a girl who looked, at a glance, exactly like my girl friend. I took a picture. She showed it to her family. They all thought it was her. We laughed.

3) No one would ever meet a stranger at a hotel room. WTF? They'd just meet for coffee or something.

I don't know if I'm going to finish. The movie might have some amazing twist at the end. There might be some interesting reason for them to both be clones or whatever. But up to this point regardless of the final reason points 1, 2, and 3 above still stand. They have no reason to act the way they're acting yet.

6273455,4,B00IKM5MIA,"This film was loosely based on the novel, ""The Double"", by the Portuguese author Jose Saramago who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998.  Yeah--probably like me, you haven't read many of his novels since they were Portuguese...
The cast had questions about the meaning of the script and the director said any of them could ask the author what he had in mind and the author said he'd be glad to respond.  Then the author died.  I suspect had he lived and the cast asked him questions, he would have told them he didn't have answers anyway, as he wanted the reader to be an active participant in the meaning of the story.  Therefore some things are left ambiguous.
His death also freed up the director and script writing, to depart a little more from the novel without having to worry about the author feeling offended.

I got this in Blu-Ray mainly on the strength of the cast and what sounded like an intriguing plot line: a man finds that he has a double in the world.  Now I'd like to switch to what it's like to watch the film, and emphasize a few points:

The film presents three statements (in print or vocally--there are some other statements that are visual, that I'll come back to) which should be seen as related to each other and to the story as a whole.  The first one appears in print on the black screen before the movie proper begins: Chaos is order yet unrecognized.  The second and third come from the history-teacher Gyllenhaal's mouth: ""That totalitarian states all have one overarching goal: control of power.  How they achieve it varies somewhat from case to case, but it usually involves controlling education, controlling media, or freedom of speech and financial controls, and may go as far as control over life or death <but this means the prior controls aren't working>.  AND THIS IS A THEME IN HISTORY.  It occurs over and over again.""  Statement three <getting closer to the plot-line> ""That Hegel said all really important events occur twice.  To that Karl Marx added: The first time is a tragedy, and the second time is a farce.""

This is like watching the least horrifying horror film you've ever seen.  That is, there's no blood, no exorcist, no clear supernatural powers, no murders etc. --yet the overall effect is rather like watching a stylish horror movie.

Or it may be compared to watching a dream--a somewhat disturbing dream--on your TV.  Things start up midway through for no apparent reason, and the story ends without quite ending, like you woke from a dream without knowing exactly what the ending was supposed to be.

The history-teacher version of Gyllenhaal starts the story off.  He has a live-in girlfriend and seems as interested in philosophy as in history, but he also looks profoundly depressed--like he feels there must be some greater meaning to life and it hasn't been revealed to him yet.  Then in a seemingly casual conversation someone recommends a film to him.  He rents the movie, and partway through, in a small role, he sees: HIMSELF.  Fascinated he has to back it up, study the face, find the actor's name in the credits--then try to find out how to contact the actor who looks like he could be an identical twin <of course, both history teacher and actor are played by Gyllenhaal, who alters nothing except his clothing to depict the differences>.

But this isn't actually where the movie begins either.  It actually begins with a scene that looks as if it could have been culled from ""Eyes Wide Shut"", or way before that from the writings of the Marquis de Sade.  This opening vignette plays out without a word being spoken.  And in fact, that's the way quite a bit of the movie plays out.

Much of the ""story"" is told visually--whether depicting the environment, or simply the expressions on faces.  Dialog is kept to the minimum needed to keep the story going forward.  There are long sections of silence, in which often it's history-teacher Gyllenhaal simply sits thinking, looking troubled.  The audience is left to fill in the blanks as to what exactly he's thinking.

There are several visual motifs which predominate.  Very early you'll see the spider/spider-web motif.  Then, there is the color-tone: almost all of it soft, glowing gold on dark brown or black.  Simultaneously looking both luxurious and dangerous.  Finally, there's the ""space-goat"" motif <just to throw in a totally obscure reference.>  Images that aren't explained, leaving the audience again to reach its own ideas on whether they are meant to actually depict some hidden reality, or whether Gyllenhaal is hallucinating, or whether they are just images he sees in his mind's eye as metaphors for reality.  Some look like they could have been plucked out of ""War of the Worlds"", and some connect vaguely to ""The Matrix"" and the idea that what you see about you isn't the real world.

I don't want to give away any more plot, I'll just say that the principle actors include Gyllenhaal x 2 and his two significant others <who also look superficially alike>, both beautiful blondes with blue eyes and very fair skin: Melanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon.  Oh of course: the cinematography makes very little use of CG or such tricks, but is nicely done and beautiful in places.  The soundtrack: one wouldn't necessarily want to call it ""music"" or certainly not songs.  The soundtrack, when it's layered on, always contributes to the sense of ominous suspense.

I hope you enjoy the film, as I did--it helps if you aren't expecting it to tell a straightforward story but to be more like, as I said, watching a long dream on the screen.  You're eyes are feeling heavy now...",1434585600,7,5612,4.747162022703819

Everything that has been written about its non-linearity and deliberately enigmatic elements is true, and there's nothing essential for me to add in terms of describing the components of the movie.  But what I do want to say is that if you're looking for unease and dread instead of horror, this movie _works_.  I was reminded constantly of the stories of the great British author of ""strange stories"" Robert Aickman.  At their best, Aickman's stories provide a real sense of a narrative arc, but though you know something mysterious and disturbing has happened, you're not sure what it was.  One of Aickman's collections of stories begins with an epigraph from Sacheverell Sitwell: ""In the end, it is the mystery that remains and not the explanation.""  That's what this movie delivers.  My only complaint (and thus the 4 stars) is that its motif of repetition does lead to a certain sameness: music, palette, symbolism.  A little more variation might have deepened the strangeness without diluting the artistic vision.  Nevertheless the film is a highly effective aesthetic mood piece that lingers in the mind long after it's over.",1434240000,,1247,4.9855072463768115

6273958,1,B00IKM5MIA,"Yes, I am one of those people who hated this movie. If you make a movie that has to be explained later on in reviews and Youtube videos, then I think as a filmmaker and story teller you have failed. Unlike Donny Darko, ironically also staring Jake Gyllenhaal, that movie was also deep but it did make sense. Perhaps through multiple viewings, but, there was a logic to it. Enemy, however, just doesn't make sense. Are the spiders real or metaphors? The giant spiders walking around the city? WHAT?! I get symbolism, yes, but when you actually show it instead of just hinting at it, it can be confusing as hell. Imagine watching a movie with a REAL pink elephant in every scene. None of the characters see the elephant but, we the viewer do. I get it, symbolism, but doing it this way is like bashing us over the head. I feel that subtle symbolism could be much more effective. Paintings of the pink elephant in the room, elephant figurines, etc. Look at the movie Wolf staring Jack Nicholson. His character feels caged, trapped. And in almost every scene there are bars or cages or some form of fencing shown. This is very subtle and only really subconsciously noticed, but it pack a bigger punch. Enemy shouldn't have made the spiders so literal. And really, I still don't understand the ending.",1433462400,,1296,4.5905172413793105

To reveal more of the story, which, as far as I can figure out, is not told in linear fashion, almost gives too much away. This is a dark film, with quirky touches, that some may find too confusing or just boring, but I couldn't get it out of my head. I did some reading about it and watched it a second time, which helped me understand it better (I think), but I'm sure I'm still far from grasping the whole thing.

Without divulging which, I felt there was a strong leaning towards whether or not this was one split-personality or two distinct individuals, but it still left room for contemplating the other scenario. I loved the score and the pacing. The acting was brilliant all around. I liked where they chose to cut scenes to leave mystery and how seemingly direct conversation left plenty of room for interpretation. But honestly, that last scene... For me, it didn't make me re-examine everything I had just seen, or make me need to see it again for any missed nuances. In fact it very nearly made me regret having seen any of it in the first place. I find no value on any level in it. However, I enjoyed the movie up until the last scene enough to try to rewrite it in my mind that the credits rolled ten seconds earlier.

Jake Gyllenhaal has easily become one of my favorite actors. He seems to nail different personality phenotypes down to a T (the first thing that comes to my mind is Nightcrawler where he portrays a prototypical sociopath). In this movie, he flip flops between 2 seemingly opposite characters that in a weird way are reunited in the end.
The supporting actresses do an absolutely fantastic job. There are subtleties in this movie that go beyond a simple story line. The beauty of the movie is that it is up to you to make your own interpretation. So do yourself a favor and watch it if you DO fit at least 2 of the qualities listed above.",1431907200,,1150,4.642156862745098

Gorgeously shot and strange, it is bare bones horror, taking very obvious cues from Hitchcock while telling a story with an arch tone of alien-ness. It's a film more fun when you don't have the film's abstract metaphorical message explained to you after the fact, I was perfectly content with not understanding the now infamous ending, too swept up in the emotional pull of this creepy nasty film. This is a film that understands fear, not as the base rush of adrenaline you get when your animal instinct is toyed with, but rather that sinking sensation when faced with something as undeniably real as it is completely impossible.

The key lies in what he says at the beginning as a teacher:
A) Totalitarian regimes are: 1) All about control  2) Suppression of Self Expression
B) Major events happen in 2s: The first a tragedy. The Second a Farse.

And to him WOMEN are that totalitarian regime, represented by SPIDERS - in which web he feels trapped in.

First Life - The Tragedy
His life is the first tragedy - repetitive, no passion. His mom (spider in the city) keeps encouraging him to continue as, and the bored husband of a pregnant wife (last spider) who does not encourage his acting career (which he blocks mentally).

Second Life - The Farse
An imaginary alter ego, who has it going, is an actor, drives a motorcycle... He has secret apartment, receives private mail at his manager's office and a subscription to a creepy sex club. The farse is who he would like to be.

The problem is that they are presented to us intertwined. He goes as professor to the apartment initially so we assume that's his real life, but real life happens in his apartment which was probably bought by his wealthy mom (implied by her lavish accommodations), with preggo blonde, who hates his lame extra ""acting career"".

6274901,4,B00IKM5MIA,"This movie was such a mind bending experience.  It is hard to write a review for this film because it would be so easy to spoil it for those who have not yet seen it.  I watched this twice and then went to a number of different sites to find out what the heck I had just watched! I watched the whole movie the first time and most likely had that ""What the...?"" look on my face, when the last scene hit my brain. I love Jake Gyllenhaal and as yet have never been disappointed by his film choices.  This one made my brain hurt, but that is usually a sign that the film moved me in some way.  I watched it a second time and things started to make sense, or so I thought. I kept thinking about it and finally decided my little brain needed help. If you do watch this movie, I recommend you do only that, just watch it.  You will definitely think about it for days. If it starts to drive you a bit nuts and you want to know what it was all about, there are all kinds of sites that have explanations. I googled a number of sites and wanted one that would give me the director and writers view. My favorite choice was Chris Stuckmans explanation of the movie, which I found on YouTube. I think this was a brave movie to make and one of the most thought provoking films I've watched.  Gyllenhaal has my respect for choosing movies that are thought provoking and make you feel. You don't always feel good, but you usually learn something about another way of looking at things.  So I loved this film and I know a lot of people will absolutely hate it.  If you have read my other ""movie"" reviews, you will notice I tend to search out films that are a bit outside the box. All art is individual choice, so all I can do is tell you what I thought about the film. For those of you who do choose to watch this one, good luck and eventually you will come to your own conclusion. (or cheat and google it!)",1429488000,,1889,4.100271002710027

Every other review has given a brief synopsis of the movie so I  will skip that, I  will explain more so why I hated the movie.

There really is no plot to the entire movie, I  kept waiting for the movie to go somewhere  but it never moved.  I  will say the movie kept us guessing and every time we were wrong. People, the movie just never moved,  it was just bad. The worst part of the movie was the ending.  Words can not express how weird the end of this movie is.

Still it is interesting to consider, and not to be damning of others with this thought because I know the medium is principally for entertainment, but if we are to consider the message of this film, then the negative reviews are to be expected from a culture that is caught in the very web the piece suggests we are all trapped.  And this constraining influence on our imaginative and intellectual freedom will, according to the film, be indecipherable because the success of any totalitarian regime--or predatorial insect--depends upon not being recognized as such.  I know for many these thoughts can hardly support my 5 star rating, but for those who care, for those who wish to fight the ""technopoly"", those who lament the collapse of public discourse in an age of images that have buried the impact of the written word--here is a work of visual art that creatively echoes the prophetic warnings of Aldous Huxley and Neil Postman.  I love the thinking of these men and with their views in mind, I loved this movie.  The ending brought it all together: wherever you find spider webs, there must be a spider somewhere near.

I will be honest though, the film requires you to really think and it does not spoon feed anything to you. I can see why some would be put off by the film, as it can seem as though it is moving along very slowly and if viewed in a literal sense, things may not make sense at all. But if you enjoy films that make you think and actually have something to say, Enemy is the film for you. From the small things, like the way the director films each shot to ratchet up the tension or the way the music builds when something seemingly innocuous is happening, to the bigger things, like Jake Gyllenhaal's incredible acting as both characters, the film is incredible.

Most of the reviewers who are rating the film lowly because it's ""boring"" or ""confusing"", don't seem to have seen the symbolism embedded in the movie. It's a film that grabs your attention from the get go and demands that you pay full attention lest you miss a detail or quick event that could clue you into seemingly bizarre sequences later on. I highly recommend this film and I implore you to pay no heed to the low reviews as this is a film that deserves to be watched and appreciated. (Also, don't take the ending literally.)",1427328000,,1679,4.326984126984127

I pity the people who watched this hoping for an interesting action-heavy story from ""that Jarhead guy"" or from those who thought ""Donnie Darko was, like, super weird, man."" The art on the TIFF poster for Enemy gives a much stronger clue about what kind of movie it is (yes, you sometimes can judge a DVD by its cover).

All that to say: this is functionally an arthouse film. If you hate films that are evenly slightly avant garde, just don't bother watching and stop flooding the reviews with one stars. You can't fault a cat for not being a very good tree, and you can't fault Enemy for not being a very good Hollywood blockbuster.

So, for everyone else who has even a semi-serious interest in films: you absolutely have to see Enemy. It's a true masterpiece that will absolutely hold up 50 years from now. You don't need to be a Cannes groupie or find David Lynch ""too accessible"" to love Enemy.

6276578,5,B00IKM5MIA,"Denis Villeneuve is the French-Canadian genius who gave us the Academy Award nominee ""Incendies"" in 2010 and the brilliant thriller ""Prisoners"" in 2013. Actually filmed before ""Prisoners"" but released after it, ""Enemy"" -- an adaptation of Portuguese Nobel prize-winning author Jose Saramago's novel, ""The Double"" -- is a great and beautiful work of cinematic surrealism requiring the viewer to constantly discern its reality from its allegorical images and sounds.

This haunting and seductive film adds to the long respected explorations of the doppelgnger theme (taken up by artists like Poe, Conrad, Dostoyevsky, Borges, Harlan Ellison and countless more), and tells of a history teacher named Adam Bell who rents a film from a local video store and discovers in it a film extra named Anthony who looks exactly like himself to the point he decides to find and confront him face-to-face. The film develops into both an erotic thriller utilizing Freudian spider symbolism, and a parable of a totalitarian state.

Jake Gyllenhaal gives us what seems to me the most versatile performance of his career playing both roles, each requiring subtle differences of character behavior. The director has called it a ""one way trip to the subconscious of a man struggling with issues regarding intimacy,"" but each viewer may have drastically different interpretations, especially after the film's last shot which has been called one of the most shocking in all cinema. I've seen ""Enemy"" four times already, and its images are unshakeable. One of the year's best.",1424390400,,1551,5.275303643724697

6276585,5,B00IKM5MIA,"As I dive deeper into this whole Amazon Instant Video thing, it becomes more and more obvious that this is a service for the ""masses."" By that, I mean it's for anyone, and you will get people on here browsing for and watching things that would never, ever have been on their radar before sites like Netflix and Amazon Instant. This is a good thing, as it gives smaller, less traditional films more exposure. It can also be a challenging thing because, whether we want to admit it not, not every film is tailored for every audience. Some things are specific, require patience, are strange or challenging, etc. Some filmmakers aren't INTERESTED in having EVERYONE like their film. They understand the realities of their audience.

As all the 1 star reviews would indicate, Enemy is just such a film. To me, it's brilliant. But the reviews are awash with simple ""it's terrible"" or ""it's boring and slow"" or ""it's the worst movie ever"" mentalities. Without sounding too condescending or making too general of a statement, may I say that for the most part, Dear One Star Reviewer, this movie was not for you. And just because you CAN leave a review doesn't mean you should. It's certainly hard to discern and self-evaluate, but do your best. And at the very least, temper your impulse to leave a 1 star review, unless you actually have something critical to say about the film, beyond ""it sucks and is slow."" The film, from a filmmaking and narrative standpoint, is top-notch; the problems mostly lie with the audience, not the film.

So if you're reading this and you're a fan of non-linear narrative, amazing acting, and cinematography that is as gorgeous as any piece of fine art hanging in a museum, you need to watch Enemy. If you are on the fence about it, just know that you'll be watching not a ""slow"" film, but a slow-burn film, one taut with tension but one very cerebral. If you aren't interested in those things, look somewhere else, for this film is probably not something you will enjoy. And if you do take a chance on it, that's awesome! But if you end up not liking it for reasons that can't be summed up better than ""it sucks"" or ""it's slow"", then don't bother leaving a review. Just my two cents on the matter. I hate seeing a film of this caliber having nearly 1,000 1-star reviews. It's not a fair representation of the film.",1423785600,4,2340,4.5823389021479715

This is something that can be well done in literature but may not transfer to the big screen so well.  If you ask me the book may be worth a read but this movie did not do anything for me at all.  I wish I had been warned in advance that the movie was just symbolic because the last scene was so ridiculous that I really felt like someone had played a practical joke on me.  I guess this is one of those movies where you love it or hate it.  If it were me, I would go watch Nightcrawler instead again.  That is Jake Gyllenhall at his best.

6276624,4,B00IKM5MIA,"I watched this a while back, and felt lukewarm about it, but the idea was interesting and the treatment felt a lot like Kafka (that's a good thing for me), so I did some homework. Read a different book by the same author (Death with Interruptions), then the source for this one (The Double), and I will read another as soon as I get it (All the Names). The guy is a fascinating writer/storyteller, but he is not an easy read, not by any stretch. 300+ pages feel like 500+ because there is virtually no white space, and idiosyncratic punctuation. Comparable to Faulkner, who is my absolute favorite, but not easy. Anyway. I finished The Double, then watched this again. All the actors are every bit as good as the other high-star reviews say they are, and the screenplay is faithful to the book's plot and mood, EXCEPT....

The director says he was using spiders as some sort of symbolic shorthand, to achieve with a few images what Saramago takes pages and pages to accomplish. I will buy that for the first one, give him a maybe for the second (giant) one, because it puts you square in Kafka-land, but the last one? I am dying to spoil the book for you all, but will leave it at more-in-keeping-with-everything-else-so-far. Some will howl that I am too linear and only like Hollywood endings and such, and they are as wrong as they usually are. The book leaves the future indeterminate, but at least has three-dimensional, human characters dealing with Death and Life After It. Those who only watch the movie get a big spider.

I actually turned to my wife and said, ""This is a cool idea but they'll write themselves into a hole they won't have any clue how to get out of"" which was correct.

A cool idea with no exit strategy, so they tried to be artsy and failed. The spider crap is apparently not in the book, so who knows what they were thinking. WTH.

I understood that it was one man with 2 conflicting desires and needs.  But the symbolism and expression of women didn't work for me.  The mother was superfluous.  Yes, she left the message on the machine, and assures him he is one man with one mother but not sure why the mother needed to be in th film.  The masturbation and symbol of women as a spider?  I guess that could have meant women don't need men, bite their heads (both) off after we mate?  Then the death of the girlfriend while he is both in the car and with his pregnant wife?

There are many positives to the film.  The acting was excellent.  Every character is played masterfully.  The wife in particular in the college commons laid the movie bare and was the hinge where the story turned.",1422230400,,890,4.41358024691358

In response, I'd like to say that not every movie is good, and the people that don't like a movie aren't necessarily stupid.  Art is subjective, and subjectively, I'll say that there is very little dialogue, and it's mostly Jake Gyllenhaal wandering around depressed and some random spiders.  Putting spiders in a movie with no explanation doesn't make it artsy and compelling,  it's just slow and pointless.

6276672,3,B00IKM5MIA,"This movie is peculiar. Foremost, the performances are quite good, and the visual styling and audio are great. As the director himself describes it, the movie is intended to be a ""spiral,"" but I don't think that accurate enough. The next part of this review has some (very) light spoilers, but I think it's necessary to put the film in context.

Ultimately, this is a movie that is *not* intended to really make sense. There's no logical definition to this movie regarding the relationship of the two characters, nor to the timeline of events that occur. The line is frequently blurred about whether they're the same person, but it seems to just kind of be misdirection. And while there's some aspect of a ""circular timeline,"" even that doesn't fit.

For me, this makes the movie unsatisfying. I like ""cerebral"" movies with layers that have to be deconstructed (for example, Primer and Timecrimes), or that are deeply symbolic; with Enemy, it's not that the ending is unresolved and leaves you with multiple interpretations, it's that there really are *no* valid interpretations, and the film is intended to make you ""reflect on duality"" and blah blah blah.

Maybe I'll read the novel and see if that offers more insight.",1421798400,2,1221,4.888888888888889

Is it a fantasy? A dream? Clones? And, what was the purpose of the gigantic spiders that appeared a couple of times.  The entire movie centers around 3 characters, 4 if you count Jake twice, and they deliver 98% of the dialogue. Isabella Rossellini appears on screen for about 60 seconds which is a huge waste of her talent. For me there was no resolution of any of the story when the movie ended.

I spent alot of the movie trying to decipher their personalities, wondering if they were the same person, attempting to make connections between the visual cues and the storyline.

6276704,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Surely NOT a film for the somewhat under-educated as I'm reading the reviews.
Just because you may not UNDERSTAND the movie,DOES NOT necessarilly mean it's bad. In fact,this is EXACTLY the sort of film I long for,as one really has to THINK hard about it to understand it,and I ASSURE you,ALL OF IT DOES makes sense. That is if your willing to actually take the time to THINK about it.(which IMO,is the best way a story is told).For its a challenge and EXERCISE  for your brain muscle.

If one is able to look BEYOND the litteral,(ie:the dialogue,and and the sometimes confusing creepy visual images),one needs to consider thier OWN human behaviors within as well.
I LOVE to think,to think and speculate the often hidden allegory & deeper meanings in films like ""Enemy"" (rather than yet AGAIN,being ""spoon fed"" an obvious plot/storyline from the typical Hollywood film,that insults it's audience by SPELLING EVERYTHING OUT,rather than a film that makes our increasingly lazy brains not having to think about anything of substance or of vague ambiguity.
Most of the themes being presented in this film, via extisential questions,and metaphorical representations being presented,(such as the SPIDER,which obviously means women),it's also about ALL OF OUR common loves,fears,desires,infidelites & addictions that we face,as human beings,just trying to survivive,in a increasingly chaotic world.

In a nutshell,This movie is like a horrible dream,that's slowly becoming true.

So,fellow hard thinkers/off-beat movie goers...see it. Love it,or leave it alone.

6276896,4,B00IKM5MIA,"I was compelled to write a review when I saw the current average rating at 2/5 stars. I have to assume the hundreds of people who rated it 1 star are just not smart enough to understand the movie. Although I wouldn't say it's particularly amazing, it's definitely at least an 8/10 movie for the cinematography, excellent casting, and directing. This is a very subtle movie, so if you're not paying attention, then you will probably get lost. You could say these reviewers are a microcosm of what's wrong with America. The masses have been dumbed down with the fluoride in the water, BPA in the plastic, genetically altered food, and a pop culture that caters to the lowest denominator. I consider myself fairly intelligent and even I didn't completely understand the movie. Look for an explanation of it on youtube and re-watch it. You'll discover that this movie is extremely coherent in its theme; it's just masked by subtle metaphors that require an open and active mind. Gyllenhaal does an admirable job playing two completely different characters, each with their own distinct personalities, who - SPOILER - are actually the same person. This movie explores the subconscious of a man afraid to commit to a wife and a family. It's nowhere near my top 10 or even top 20, but it's definitely worth a watch and a re-watch, and will get your mind working. A Michael Bay explosion-orgy this is not.",1420243200,,1397,4.776859504132231

I didn't have trouble following it, and I don't mind slow movies if they get me to think or realize something new. I like sci-fi, but this movie had absolutely no ""wow"" moments for me--just several cringes.

I also didn't think Gyllenhaal did anything spectacular in his portrayal of the two characters. I didn't find them to be that dramatically different. One had a stutter. Whoop-dee-doo.

However, as in Blindness, Saramago is a master who can stretch a metaphor so far to the point of breaking into meaninglessness and harness more power from it that way.  But Villeneuve doesn't come close to carrying the writing of a Nobel prize writer.  His version pops the balloon into triviality falling vacuously flat on the floor.

The director meant to put some power into it, but piling up some metaphors and mixing them with obscurantism isn't what does it.  It's art's job to get through and make a difference, even if we don't understand what that was.  I like atmospheric movies, like Tarkovskiy films...he makes the most ""boring"" movies ever, but they add up to something which resonates at some level.  This movie is just a one note song.

Slow  - took way too long to set the plot.  The first half hour could have been cut down to 5 minutes.  Looks like it was filmed in Sepia which was unnecessary for the plot and made it hard to watch. The script was poor and left you uncaring about any of the characters.  The only thing worse than the story was the end,  except I was so thrilled it was over.

It never got any better than the bad start, just kept getting worse.  The interviews after words indicate they want the viewer to decide what the movie was about. It was about 1:45 long that is all I knew for sure. Plenty of symbolism in the movie but it was just not interesting enough to make me think about it.

6277233,5,B00IKM5MIA,"There's the surface level story as given in the movie's premise (a man seeking out his doppelganger, and getting more than he bargained for), and the movie can be enjoyed purely on that level as a creepy thriller.  The movie can also be enjoyed on another level entirely, and there's no twists or tricks here, despite what you may have heard.  If you're waiting for ""the truth"" to be revealed at the end like it's a Saw movie, you will be disappointed.  All the pieces are there for you to put together, if you have the patience...the movie is only 90 minutes long.  Millions of people sit through 150-minute long Transformers movies every few years, so do give this movie a try.

Light spoilers/hints:

Don't assume everything you're seeing in regards to Adam and Anthony is the literal truth.  But pay close attention to how every other character reacts to them.  Everything the other characters do is true and reveals what's really happening.

MAJOR SPOILERS (If you just want to know already):

It's pretty clearly telegraphed throughout the movie that they are the same person.  Anthony is Adam's past.  Adam confronting Anthony is actually Adam facing up to the fact that he used to be a total jerk, and was reverting to that persona to his pregnant wife (which explains her distress with Anthony, and her happiness/acceptance when Adam takes Anthony's place).  It wasn't a coincidence that Adam's coworker suggested that particular movie to watch...he had seen it, and recognized Adam/Anthony in it from his acting days.  Mary freaking out at Anthony's wedding ring tan wasn't panic over realizing Anthony was a fake, the whole scene was a memory from the past when Mary discovered that her boyfriend was actually married to someone else, and was cheating with her.  The theme of the movie is that we become different people over the course of our lives, and confronting our past can be like meeting a doppelganger.  As for the spiders?  I consider that extra flavor, adding to the creepy atmosphere, but people are welcome to go crazy trying to over-interpret it.  Maybe it says something about how Adam/Anthony sees women, or about his fear of impending fatherhood, but I really do believe the focus of the movie is simply Adam coming to grips with who he used to be.",1419638400,66,2276,4.80719794344473

In that hour, there was little character development and no discernible plot, beyond a man discovering his doppelganger living in the same city.

6277266,3,B00IKM5MIA,"Two words for this film: original but pretentious. In terms of cinematography, ""Enemy"" is a very well made film. The entire film leaves you in suspense and uncertainty from the moment it begings until it ends. The scarce and minimalistic score helps build the tension throughout the film. ""Enemy"" is a film that requires the viewer to be active and analyze its symbolism, and in this, Villeneuve proves to be a skillful director.

However, and this is why I am giving it 3 stars, this is a film that tries too hard at being original, and, for me, this is what makes it disappointing. It's so clear that Villeneuve thought while making it: ""only a few people will understand it"". I did understand the film and, like I said above, it's in fact, one of a kind, but the movie is original as it is also pretentious.

If you want to watch a film that it's both original and thought-provoking, ""Enemy"" is not to be missed. For me, however, effortless is more enjoyable than pretentious, and this movie tries too hard at being unique.",1419552000,,1026,4.570652173913044

Gyllenhaal does a great job at playing two distinct characters that happen to look identical. The subtle nuances between the two are very well done.

However, the movie is so heavy with symbolic meanings that it bogs down the flow of the movie. Many times, scenes just seem to drag under the weight of all the symbolism. The visual tone of the film seemed really bleak, too.

The acting is better than the story line - yet an hour into the movie neither has reached any level of building interest or intrigue.

6277761,5,B00IKM5MIA,"This movie makes you think too much... I just want to be told a story with a clear beginning, a middle and a happy ending..

That's my paraphrasing of some of the negative reviews I read.

For me, this is not a story. It is an immersion into the character(s) played by Gyllenhaal. It's like you just stepped into the life of someone else, and have to try to sort out the back story. Some movies are just like that. Some movies just work at captivating you by this immersion, and you just have to ride it out and see if you can make sense of it.

But that is how it would be for anyone,right? I mean we all lead somewhat complicated lives with somewhat complicated pasts. Stepping into anyone's mind and riding out the next few days or weeks, does not mean you know the back story, or the reasons why you do things. Now, imagine stepping into someone's mind, where things are... disjointed.. and now you have to make sense of it.. That's what this movie is.

It is interesting and captivating, for those who want that sort of experience, like me. Obviously not so interesting for those who want to be told a story..",1417046400,,1114,4.341346153846154

As a plot and story in itself, I didn't find much here, but nevertheless, I found it completely compelling and I'd watch it again to see what else I can pull out of it.  If you like 'Art' films, you'll like this one, if you don't, you'll give it a 1-star review at best.  As is reflected in the reviews, this movie appeals to a small audience.

6277793,5,B00IKM5MIA,"Admittedly, this film is not for everyone. It's artsy, it's ambiguous to the the point of answering pretty much nothing, it relies heavily on symbolism. It counts on its audience to pay attention to every little tiny detail to even understand the movie in the slightest. It's a slow-burn thriller. It's not a typical movie that follows typical moves that we see daily. It's a movie made to be picked apart piece-by-piece by the audience. I've seen it compared to Lynch's Mulholland Dr. in terms of surrealism and mind-bending storytelling.

I totally understand why this movie has so many negative reviews, but with that said, I loved it. I certainly didn't understand it at first, I had to put some research into figuring out how to just interpret this movie to my liking. I say to my liking, because there are so many different theories and interpretations, it's up to you, the viewer, to take what you want from it.

Also, it has Jake Gyllenhaal in dual roles in which I think contains his best acting to date. He's playing two different characters (Adam/Anthony) that look exactly the same, but it's still so easy to tell the two apart due to Jake's little mannerisms that he gives each character. In this, I forgot that I was watching Gyllenhaal and was totally immersed with his two characters. That, to me, is a testament of how well he acted. Mlanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon, the two female leads, were beautiful and did fantastic as well.

I just loved this movie.",1416873600,,1472,4.6976744186046515

His posture and motions and facial expressions are totally different bringing each character to life differently.  There are some hints that let you know what is going on with the movie and the characters but you really need to be watching the body language and facial expressions of the characters.

The movie must be far too symbolic for me though as it just did not make sense. The spider images supposedly represent femininity, for anyone who is watching and hasn't seen the interview with the director and Jake at the end. It certainly leaves you wondering at the end about what the main character is going to do.

6277859,5,B00IKM5MIA,"Nine Things About the Movie Enemy

1. This is one of the only films in my life that actually gave me nightmares. And it's technically not even a horror movie.

2. It's about a neurotic, semi-depressed college professor, stuck in a routine life. When he sees a movie with an actor that looks just like him, he becomes obsessed with meeting his double.

3. From there the movie veers off into very surreal territory, and begins to fold over itself in unexpected and confusing ways.

4. Jake Gyllenhaal plays both the teacher and the actor. While they look identical, you can technically tell them apart because one of them wears a wedding ring. However, Gyllenhaal's two performances are so strong that he actually seems to be two actors. The two characters are so well delineated that you can tell just from Gyllenhall's body language and speech patterns which person he is.

5. There is a real, masterful sense of creeping dread and menace that builds relentlessly to the final scene.

6. Oh, and about that final scene. I don't care how good you are at predicting movies - you will not see this ending coming. And then either your soul will jump in frustrated horror, or you will start the movie over again. Or both.

7. There are a lot of really short scenes that last only a few seconds - or short segments of longer scenes - that provide some clues as to what's really going on. You won't realize their significance the first time you watch the movie.

8. The opening epigraph of the film is a quote from the novel on which the movie is based: ""Chaos is order yet undefined"". It not only sets the tone for the film, but provides the key for at least one of the film's possible meanings.

9. Part thriller, part allegory, part existential nightmare, this is perhaps the most brilliant and inscrutable movie of 2014.",1416614400,,1818,4.569230769230769

6277867,2,B00IKM5MIA,"An academic has a humdrum, dead-end life. Get up, go to class, come home, repeat. One day out of the blue, someone who hardly ever speaks to him recommends a movie. He gets it, watches it, watches it again and see a bit player who looks exactly like himself, does some research and finds the actor. They meet.  Up to this point, good, as far as building a certain intensity, but from that point on, the story goes riding madly off in all directions.

I was sucked into ordering this DVD from netflix because of the blurb. It offered so many possibilities...a psychological thriller...a mystery... What I got was...???  This film was confusing, bizarre, but first and foremost just plain weird.  The pacing was painfully slow, plenty of lingering close-ups with long stretches of silence. Dream sequences...I think that's what they were. The soundtrack was completely wasted. Most of the scenes didn't mesh; they appeared to be from different movies.  Just when it looked as if the plot had found a direction to go, it would simply stop. It was also a little difficult to keep track of which character was doing what since the actor and the teacher looked exactly alike and no delineation was made from a scene with one to a scene with the otherr.

I'm accustomed to symbolism in movies and can generally recognize hidden meanings and how they relate to what going on. I've redeemed many a ""dull"" film this way, but this one...? I felt as if this were the result of one of those improv drama assignments where students draw incidents out of a hat and then embellish them and act them out. Each student added his assignment to the mix and this film was the result. What was with all the spiders anyway? I know they were symbols but of what? And that ""secret club"" at the beginning? As for the ending?  I was left with, ""What the...?"" as were the others watching it with me.

I wish I could've been in the first commercial audience to see this movie. It would've been interesting to see how many demanded their money back. I'm giving it a 2-star rating because the actors managed to keep straight faces throughout and I consider that good acting. I notice there's a featurette which goes into the making of the film, etc.  It's interesting to read the reviews for it. However... If you shouldn't have to explain something to make it understood. Movies, the visual media should make whatever obvious.

(Now that I've written all this, I'm wondering if a second look would give me any more insight.  Nah...I don't think so.)",1416441600,,2519,4.638202247191011

Thats the opportunity Adam Bell has handed to him in Enemy, a psychological thriller based on the novel The Double by Jose Saramago.

Bell is a history professor living in Quebec whose day-to-day existence could not be more humdrum and mundane. Hes as bored by the rote lectures he delivers to his benumbed students as he is by the woman hes currently dating. Then one day he espies what appears to be his doppelganger acting in a bit part in a movie hes rented. Bell suddenly becomes obsessed with meeting his double, a feeling that becomes strangely mutual after Bell makes contact with the initially suspicious actor, Anthony Clare, who eventually becomes as intrigued by their uncanny similarity as Bell is.

With its tale of two strangers whose lives become inextricably entwined due to an incredible fluke of nature, Enemy draws upon such diverse sources as Kafka, Pirandello, Hitchcock, De Palma and Cronenberg for its inspiration and style - and throws in  some subtle little homages to Through a Glass Darkly (in the penultimate shot) and Blow-Up( in the intense rustling of the trees), for added flavor. And writer Javier Gullon and director Denis Villenueve do full justice to those sources.

Its an existential thriller that delves into such issues as alternate universes, schizophrenia, and the possibility of personality and identity transference. The last is a theme that has been explored in such movies as Ingmar Bergmans Persona, as well as Robert Altmans Images and Three Women, to name just a few. Enemy never allows us to accept anything we see at face value. Were never entirely sure that what is taking place on screen is really happening or whether its all just the result of an elaborate form of mental illness, a possibility made all the more plausible by the shocking and perplexing final moment of the movie. And can two identical objects occupy space in the same universe, or does one have to eliminate the other in order to survive? And who will be the victor in the end?

Jake Gyllenhaal gives a nervy performance in the dual role of the professor and the actor, with the distaff side represented by Melanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon as the women in the mens lives and Isabella Rossellini as Bells mother in what amounts to little more than a cameo appearance in the movie.

With its stark surrealism and air of off-kilter creepiness, Enemy has a way of insinuating itself into your subconscious and leaving you a bit rattled after its over. It sure makes you look at the world in a different way. And what more could you ask from a movie?",1414800000,,2670,4.75377969762419

This film is a vanity flick, made by amateurs with some crazy idea that they are motion picture auteurs.  Instead it is burdened with psychobabble on the highest scale and produced simply because the Canadian government and the city of Toronto threw a ton of Canadian loonies (""dollars"" in the USA) at those involved in its production i.e, everyone involved got a paycheck and a great vacation to boot.  This reviewer purposely took the time to watch the film director and star attempt to explain the why's and wherefores of the film and the concept behind it.  One has never witnessed such a convoluted and inane conversation.  Talk about psychobabble!

Jake Gyllenhaal did a good job acting the parts but the director must have been on crack when doing this film. It had potential to be a good thriller but it just never took off and then it ended with the most ridiculous ending ever! After the movie there was an interview with Jake and the director and it only confirmed my feeling that the director was on crack!! STUPID! STUPID! STUPID!!!

6278278,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Now first off, I can understand why this movie is not well received. This is about as cerebral as they can come, and it is a film that is only going to be liked by a small niche. I found this movie to be very interesting and disturbing, the movie has absolutely eerie atmosphere, and leaves you many times from beginning to end saying audibly ""WTF!?"".
Now this is a movie that is essentially about the same man, well not even essentially it is about one person, but it is basically an artistic look at the psychological facets of varying personality that we all have. And its done in a very symbolic, as well as atmospheric way. Now this movie is confusing, I think most need to stop at the end and really think about what just took place to really figure it out.
My suggestion is to flip back and forth through the movie watching some of the scenes after you have finished it, because if you have followed the movie well enough and don't outright hate it, doing this is what finally tied what the heck was going on for me.
After you have done this, watch the discussion with Gyllenhaal and the director at the end of the film, and this will also help to give you a clearer picture of the film.
I really enjoyed it, the only reason I knocked it down one star, is yes it is a very compelling and interesting tale, and done in a very cool and eerie way. And I personally plan on watching it again, I just wasn't blown out of the water by it, but in any case I Still really enjoyed it.
If you have enjoyed movies like, Donnie Darko, Mulholland Drive, Jacobs Ladder, or similar very cerebral eerie films, than chances are you will at least be entertained by the movie, but it is fair to say, you will have to watch it to find out what you think in the end.",1413849600,,1752,4.217261904761905

I wish I had followed my instinct at the 30 minute mark when I realized that it was never going to be any better than boring.  From there it got worse.

It seemed the French Director was simply trying to please himself with game playing on interpretations thinking we'd all want to watch it over and over to figure it out, but the symbolism about how he sees women is grotesque.

Did you see the interview afterward where the director talks about how things are circular and web-like?  The example was so lame and contrived!  This is just a failed attempt to make a thought provoking movie.  The supposedly ""deep"" stuff was actually executed in ways that leave you flat and uninterested.  This movie is a waste of time.

The primary points of confusion were at the beginning and end of the movie, and in the middle a mystery that never gets solved. And somehow, it all strings together.

6278418,4,B00IKM5MIA,"The movie has to be watched from beginning to end to fathom the intent what's actually occurring. Jake Gyllenhaal is a superb multidimensional actor in Enemy--split personas. You have one character, so convincing that the differences when he's with the wife and when he's with the girlfriend are detectable only to each woman, during the sexual scenes. A woman always knows the difference, and the actor is That good in demonstrating this. Nothing can change the fact that hes one man. I get that, from following closely. Symbolism is not needed in this movie to make it believable and suspenseful. Symbolism takes away instead of contributing to the intensity, which was probably the aim. Didn't work, and in some respects symbolism drags the movie down and defeats. Remove the symbolism and you have a more intense thriller.
As the actor, St. Claire, the character is heartless and cheats on his wife. As a history teacher, he is tired all the time, with the girlfriend, and with good reason, since he's living a double life. But...I have to say that the endingand I won't spoil itwas unnecessary--I just did not get that kind of symbolic scene.  Totally wasted the movie and left me wanting more, and not being left to make up my own ending and understanding. Indeed, suspenseful throughout, yet that last symbol was unnecessary. I applaud all three actors, but the movie needs a remake, because it leaves the viewer thinking he or she wasted an investment of time.

One negative review even argued that this was not a good ""action"" movie, as if that is the genre standard by which all films should now be judged.

I suppose that this is the result of a society in which the arts have been dumbed-down to Michael Bay levels and deemed superfluous as part of a welll-rounded education.

Each of us exposes different personalities with different people: sibling, parent, child, lover, peer, etc. With Jake portraying both Adam and Anthony this video provides us with another opportunity for alternate perspectives upon who we are, were, and will be.

I found all the main characters interesting and enjoyed the video's flow. I was surprised by the ending: Anthony, as Adam, and Adam's girl friend may be gone. Adam, as Anthony, had a surrealistic moment when he thought he was going to see Anthony's wife in the bedroom.

For those who remain under the spell of Saramago's strange and seductively intelligent writing this film will satisfy. For those who prefer linear story lines of everyday possibilities the film will likely not find an appreciative audience. This is a film that demands the full attention of the viewer and the acceptance of alternative ways of viewing reality and alternative reality.

Living in Toronto, Adam Bell Jake Gyllenhaal) is a college history professor, a loner, routiner, whose contact with the world outside the classroom is limited to life with his live in girlfriend Mary (M&eacute;lanie Laurent). A fellow teacher (Joshua Peace), apparently attempting to open Adam's vistas, recommends he watch films and recommends a particular film to Adam. When Adam watches the film he notes an actor playing a bellhop who looks like Adam. He becomes obsessed with finding out about this double of his. He learns that the actor's stage name is Daniel Saint Claire, whose legal name is Anthony Claire (again Jake Gyllenhaal). Claire is a Toronto based actor with only a few on-screen credits, and is married to a woman named Helen (Sarah Gadon) who is six months pregnant. Adam becomes obsessed with meeting Claire, who he learns upon first sighting that they look exactly the same, from the facial hair to a scar each has, but Claire who seemingly better adjusted than Adam. Their lives become intertwined as Claire himself ends up becoming obsessed with Adam, but in a slightly different way. Is Adam viewing his alternate real self (a married man with a child on the way) and escaping his reality with an affair with Mary? It is left for the viewer to decide.

The atmosphere created by the actors (Gyllenhaal is excellent as are Laurent, Gadon, and Isabella Rossellini who plays Claire's - or Adam's? - mother), the cinematography by Nicolas Bolduc and the music score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans are stunning. The introduction of a tarantula motif adds further mystery to this vivid film. A film for adventuresome thinkers who enjoy being challenged.

This movie left me thinking too. Thinking why didn't I read the reviews before I watched the movie. The only redeeming moments were accomplished by the supporting cast.

The viewer will note how Gyllenhaal's changes are so subtle, yet so convincing: his posture is perhaps the most noticeable, and the most convincing.  This is not a film for the casual viewer, for it is rich with symbolism and can be confusing.  Students of film will find the piece engaging and demonstrative of the director's philosophy and perspective.  I found it shocking, engaging, and perplexing.

But this film is nothing short of creative and thought provoking. Even if you watched it and didn't understand it, there's some great analysis theories on youtube that explain a lot. Also, the score for this film fits it perfectly.

You have a choice of going to a nice theater with stadium seating and seeing the newest release that is supported by a heavy marketing campaign or you can go to the little independent theater with the old-style seating, the uncomfortable chairs, the sticky floor from all the spilt soda that hasn't been cleaned up and watching something that you really don't know much about but hey, art theaters usually show interesting things. If you chose the first option, skip this, you will think it is horrible and boring. If you chose the second option, then watch this, it's your type of movie.

I never read the novel but I sure hope it made a little more sense than the movie. There are hidden messages through out the movie about giant spiders, doppelgangers and Ancient Rome and New World Totalitarianism.

I guess there is a book you need to read before watching the movie so you have some idea of what's going on. ""Catch 22"" was like that. If I hadn't read that book I would have been really confused by the film. Maybe some movies start out with scenes that explain the story line, then get lost in the final cut. All I could figure out was it seemed to have something to do with spiders. At the beginning it looks like a dancer at a private club is about to step on a spider. Then at the end the actor's wife seems to turn into a spider. Something that might have been interesting to know is why were the two men identical even down to a scar? But an explanation was never given. It was a waste of time. There may have been a time in my life that I might have been fascinated and drawn into the movie.

I almost turned it off after 15 minutes; then something happened that sucked me in.  Even after that part, you are going to think you can do something else while you watch, because it is so slow, but if you do, you will be lost and have to slide it back a few minutes and watch it over again.  You must watch every minute.  So it is not as slow as you think.

This movie is for people who use their brain.  Even after you ""get it"" there will be these weird parts; but just relate them to the weird start of this movie and file it away.  Then the movie ends, and you still don't get it; or kind of you do. Perhaps they leave it for you to figure out.  I have my idea of what the point is.  I don't want to give anything away, but some of the obscure scenes give it some light.

The scenes in the dark are so dark you can't see them, and in the light, it may as well be black and white, because all you will see is black and white, with shades of green, and a bit of red thrown in every now and then.  It lasts under 90 minutes, so it can't be that slow. . . .

I gave it three stars; I am not sure it is worth that many; perhaps it is worth 4 stars.  Maybe if I go back and watch it twice. . . .

A little hint, without spoiling it; the professor's lectures at the beginning;  you should take note of what he says.  Plus pay attention to the parts when the red color dominates.  Look in the background as well as the foreground.

 If you are into syfy, you will love this movie; if not, you most likely you won't.

The movie has some good acting by Gyllenhaal, but definitely drags quite a bit. One could come up with their own interpretation and maybe make the movie more interesting, but the director's vision (according to the commentary after the movie) just seems a bit delusional to me. The main character seems to border on schizophrenia in the way the director portrays him. I get the guy is torn between what he has and what he wants, but some of the scenes just leave me wondering just what the director was really thinking.

I think there are flaws in this film but  film-makers may want to see this film in order to see where concepts become overdrawn. The film is one of allegory and metaphor. What I gathered from the movie is how it is to live under a dictatorship where the citizens are unaware of the power that lies above them. The literal doubling of Gyllenhaal is an interesting concept but the characters seem too alike in the way they are acted out. Another issue I found is that the pacing of the dialogue seemed off. But maybe that is the point. I thought the lighting was too dark at points but that could be the streaming. All and in all this film interested me in the book by Saramengo. Mostly, due to the amount of plot holes and its over elliptical nature I think the story itself may be quite intriguing.

6279465,5,B00IKM5MIA,"SPOILER ALERT

This movie is for thinkers. As a thinker, admittedly a lazy one, I still found myself pulled into the story of Adam Bell. It wasn't boring at all. I agree with other reviews that state that audiences are now used to explosions, cgi effects and scripts that can be easily fit into much used templates. Movies now usually are escape from thinking, not a call to it.

With that said, I wasn't able to understand Enemy on my own. Though I was pulled in, and after reading interpretations of it had clearly missed key giveaways about the film, I couldn't piece it all together myself.  I did kind of get at the end, when his wife turned into a huge spider, that it was connected to the spider about to be destroyed by the women's foot in the beginning. I didn't understand why she was afraid - I was more caught off guard by the last scene that had everyone scared. It didn't scare me, just threw me off.

I'll admit that I didn't realize they were the same person until the end. I mean, how would Adam know what Anthony's key was for? That was like a ""duh"" moment for me. I thought that Adam was going to steal Anthony's life, stay with his wife at first - until he fingered the key right at the end and said he was going out later.

There's so much to say about this movie. Whether you'll like it or not depends on what you expect when you watch movies: mindless entertainment or challenging entertainment. I found Gyllenhaal's acting to be wonderfully and surprisingly advanced. I found the scenes jarring, and confusing, yet attractive. I found myself waiting to see what would happen next.

This movie makes me feel lazy and slow. I want to be sharp and fast. Especially when it comes to thinking, making connections, understanding symbolisms and visual imagery. Whether or not you understand it is one thing. If you end up not liking it, I would suggest that you've become a lazy thinker, if you're one at all.

A depressed college professor knocks up his new girlfriend and has to untangle the double-life that he apparently doesnt know hes living because hes got split-personality disorder.

The main character is portrayed in the film as two different (but identical) people.  He is a college professor with a girlfriend.  He has developed a split personality due to depression with his mundane life.  His new persona is a bit-part film actor with a fast motorcycle and a 6-months pregnant lover.  Now hes got to figure out how to dump his old girlfriend.  This movie is how his old self discovers his new self, how the new self confronts the old life and the physical fight for which persona (and which girlfriend) will survive.

Its an artsy-psychological tale with sparse dialog and lots of confused hints of an actual plot.  The unsatisfying surprise-ending seemed like a lame attempt to explain all of the ""tangled web"".

This bonus feature will help you piece things together and help you to come to your own conclusion of what happened.

If you want to be immersed in a eerie world with some great imagery, and a narrative that'll have you thinking about it long afterwards, this is a must see, especially if you enjoy films like ""Mulholland Dr."" I'm not going to go into my interpretations of the film, but I will say this film gripped me the whole way through and I was never bored.

The less you know going in, the better. That being said, despite what some viewers claim, this movie has a complex, (and in my opinion) flawlessly-executed story. It all culminates in one of the most shocking and memorable endings I've ever seen.

There are only a handful of actors in the entire film and they all do outstanding work. In my opinion, this is one of the best performances of Jake Gyllenhaal's career. Much like Denis Villeneuve previously-released film ""Prisoners"", Enemy features beautiful cinematography and lighting. The sepia-tinted Toronto skyline is beautiful and foreboding. There are shots in this movie that made me jealous because they are so good. It also features a great score that perfectly accompanies the dark and creeping atmosphere.

I am a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, he much like PHILIP Seymour Hoffman has a body of work that has been worthy of the few hours I donate to this pastime. ENEMY is an interesting film; I think I wanted or maybe expected something different, Gyllenhaal's performance was superb, his geminian performance was mesmerizing, but; the ending left me in the middle of the film wondering how I got there.",1408579200,,698,4.816666666666666

6279713,5,B00IKM5MIA,"""Enemy"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and directed by Denis Villeneuve is a film made up of a complex, very unique storyline that does not give you the usual ""beginning, middle, and end,"" found in most movies being produced today.  This film is not ""linear"" as Villeneuve states in the interview with him and Gyllenhaal, which is tagged on to the end of the film shown on Amazon Prime.  Those of you who rated this as a ""one star"" movie need to watch this post-movie interview, and then re-watch the film with the most open mind you can conjure up and with none of your usual film watching expectations you take along to view movies.  Those of you who did not like this film, but usually like  Gyllenhaal's performances, need to realize (in my opinion) that he is maturing as an actor and seems to be venturing into projects that may not prove to be your usual cup of tea! You're going to tell me that you somehow missed in this film his boyish great looks, accompanied by a beautiful woman co-star, his not-so-obvious unscripted ""aside comments"" which are very entertaining, his romps, and humping and pumping in bed with lots of butt showing, and great acting.  ""Enemy"" gives you a ""two-fer"" of these Gyllenhaal-in-film characteristics and antics, where he plays a dual role, from my perspective, of one in the same character depicting two separate lives yet in a parallel universe. I found this well produced film quite entertaining ranging from a few ""creepy"" scenes to the painting and re-stitching of the main character's two lives coming together, causing an open-minded movie viewer to elevate themselves to heightened anticipation levels. I don't want to give away too much more, so I will not go into greater detail but suffice it to say don't pass up an opportunity to view this film. As authors we struggle with creating various storylines containing plots uniquely presented to maintain readers' attention. I'm finishing a book, for example, with three parallel streams of consciousness, each resuming with every third chapter. I wouldn't hesitate to hire someone like Gyllenhaal to star and/or direct this piece. (Yes, writers are always great dreamers!)

Couldn't get through the entire movie in one sitting.  It just didn't hold enough interest.

Jake GyllenHaal did a great job acting, but acting alone doesn't make a movie.  The story line needs to be interesting.

It reminded me of a Hitchcock film, only not nearly as good, not nearly as original.  The director seems to have tried to make it European-esque by mixing in loose ends and unresolved plot lines.  These just made the whole thing more disjoint.

The ending:  In 5 seconds, the film went from bad because it was boring and predictable to really bad because it was boring, predictable, and then suddenly stupid.

6279763,5,B00IKM5MIA,"A masterpiece of cinema, really. I can't remember ever encountering a film whose amazon reviewers were so off the mark, and I've spent my share of hours reading reviews to determine what to watch or buy.

The profundity of this film lies in the nuance of the dynamics between the four main characters: our two Jake Gyllenhaals and each of their partners. Upon first watch, the plot's unfolding held my attention consistently and yet I watched this film twice, in fact, and was struck the second time by how masterfully the Gyllenhaal portrays two opposing identities. If one zooms into any given conversation, practically 90% of them is teeming with intensity and energy. The actors and actresses exude precisely the tone and expression to make each seem completely genuine. Given the fact that the dynamic each character is encountering (talking to an exact copy of one's self, talking to an exact copy of one's partner, talking to one's partner about a copy of him) is strange and not necessarily intuitive or laced with cliche from which to draw, the nearly flawless execution of each is truly stunning.

Generally speaking, one can tell an artful film quite easily by the following signature: the metascore (i.e. the combined rating of professional film reviewers) of the film is in the 70+/100 and yet the lay viewer's average review is under 3 stars. This film is no exception--the fact that folks watch it and are so perplexed that their only reaction is to call it a ""one-star"" film reveals the impatience and lack of taste of most viewers. The truth is that the nuance and the tension that makes great films like Enema simply don't emerge in the pacing and cliche plot structures that appeal to our constant stimulation obsessed movie watching public. Enemy falls into this category--so I echo the other 5-star reviewers: it's worth a watch or two.",1408147200,7,1857,4.8734177215189876

That night, the other female turns into giant tarantula in the last moment of the film--presumably to eat the depressed teacher.  Now that's depressing.  I guess we're all enemies of ourselves, and our wives want to kill us.

6279863,5,B00IKM5MIA,"Enemy is like the Picasso of film. Most people are going to hate it, and those that are artistically inclined will love it. In other words, this movie is not for everyone, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. The low score ratings are all saying ""too slow"" or ""I didn't get it"". While I agree that the movie is slow moving, that is actually a benefit for this film because there are so many hidden clues that you need to really think through everything. If it went too fast it would be difficult to piece everything together.

 Jake Gyllenhaals performance is spectacular for both the main character and his doppleganger. One being a shy, jittery, insecure professor, and the other a confident actor. The small details he put into each role was masterful. The movie has an eerie feel to it, with the music being primarily unsettling the entire time, but I think that helped set the tone that nothing is quite right with this situation. The director did a fine job bringing everything together at the end and also at hiding the bread crumbs along the way. I wasn't a huge fan of the ""yellow"" tone of the film, and wonder if there is a subtext for it, like cowardice. If you look for it, you can find the clues to piece everything together to understand the meaning behind the story, and that I think is where most people will say ""This movie sucks"" because they don't want to piece it together. Unfortunately, there is no long monologue explaining all the mystery. You have to use your brain. When you do figure it out, you'll finally understand why this film is one of the best films of our generation.

In closing, if you're a fan of film that is cerebral, intelligent, artsy, and puzzling, then this movie is very much for you. If you're looking for a scary movie or a thriller, or a horror movie that requires little thought, then you've come to the wrong place.",1408060800,,1868,4.488235294117647

6280145,5,B00IKM5MIA,"The duality of our desires and our outward actions is always a struggle.  Law, morality, values and our ego all pressure our actions and make us who we are.  Gyllenhaal portrays these two characters who are trapped in their own lives yet the women they are with are more tuned to their doubles.  I had trouble deciding exactly what the dream sequences meant, whether they were dreams, nightmares or fantasy was uncertain, but the message communicated and the feeling they inspired within me made me want to know more.  The movie is not really about finding out who this double is, it is about finding the darkness that lives within each of us, the, ""what would I do in this circumstance.""  That is where  the complimentary nature of these characters is harnessed.
The camerawork was brilliant.  The crossing of paths of Gyllenhaal and Laurent while the camera swoops around the two creates a sense of invasion.  The hunter has his mark and the unsuspecting prey is completely oblivious.
The movie was slow paced, it was suspenseful, and I remember the feeling in my gut when the movie became less about the mystery of how this came to be and became about the darker human emotions.",1407801600,2,1181,4.726829268292683

This is not for those seeking to be bottle fed with cheap thrills, noise, sex and violence.

6280148,3,B00IKM5MIA,"First, let me say that most people would probably not like this movieespecially the typical Jake Gyllenhaal fan. The story is slow and the direction is very artistic. Once the movie finally gets going and starts getting interesting, it abruptly ends and with a ""HUGE"" twist that will leave most people screaming temporarily and then scratching their heads to make sense of it. Second, let me say that I, personally, thought the movie was the most unique movie I saw in a while. While totally surprised by the ending and I think it would've made more sense if the story ended differently, but I think the director/story definitely probably gets the reaction it was going for. I initially was annoyed by the ending, but then after thinking about it, I ended up thinking it was pretty funny/cool how it all came about. The only drawback for me was that there were parts of the movie/story that didn't add up with how it ended. Lastly, the movie/story doesn't seem like it should be taken literally, but seen as more of an extreme analogy of how figuratively blind people can be (even experts) to what's actually going on around them, especially in a totalitarian statewhich might be too much for the average movie goer.",1407801600,,1216,4.740566037735849

The only really interesting thing here was that there were two identical guys who never knew each other, one of them a kind of listless professor without much of anything going for him; his twin is a part time actor who is more aggressive and outgoing.  The professor is the one pushing the meeting, after discovering his twin self, but that's all he pushes.  He's too pathetic and lethargic as a human being to get too attached to him.  There's some goofy love affairs going on that reflect the same sort of female interests, as well as some sloppy swapping as revenge at the end of the movie, that somehow ties it together.

You have to put your cell phone down and get cerebral.  Brilliantly acted and directed.  Incredible sets and costumes.  The cinematography creates the mood and the bleakness of the main character's obsession and lack thereof.

But even when the lighting guy came back to work the rest of the film doesn't get any better.  You only keep watching in the hope that there will be some sort of payoff for the time you've already wasted so far.

This may explain the one star reviews. It is a strange culture where we don't want to think, but I myself find myself skimming over news articles when I should be reading and analyzing them. If you ever watched twilight zone or outer limits on Amazon or Netflix you would probably like this movie but I think this hits a deeper level. It is about totalitarian government, which nobody realizes they are dwelling in ( in this case the spider infested kind), which the main character referred to in the beginning of the movie without knowing anything about spiders. I think though there is something subtler going on. If you give you mind time to dwell on it you would find there can be a dictatorship and totalitarian government within ourselves  which to me is brought out in the opening scenes and alluded to in the talk with the elevator operator.

Well perhaps we should remain asleep while the spiders at the NSA spread their web so tightly that we never realize our freedoms have been taken away or perhaps the spider within has spun its web so totally that we do not have a mind left to enjoy a well made movie that is too hard for us to understand so we give it a one star review.

6280471,2,B00IKM5MIA,"A Spanish-Canadian production Enemy is not just a psychological thriller. Watching this weird tale is like watching someone elses nightmare  a nightmare that, weird as it is, looks forced and artificial. Film critics would have a field day trying to decode the film and find some meanings, however. Perhaps discussing these things would be much more interesting than the film itself.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) and based on a novel by Jos Saramago, Enemy follows the story of an ordinary history teacher Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal), who finds (in a movie he rented) a man who looks exactly like him. He contacts the man  Anthony Claire is the mans name  and meets him in a hotel room.

While the film shows how this curious incident changes the lives of the two identical males drastically (or are they two?), it also shows us some bizarre images, some related to spider. Like Edgar Allan Poe's famous short tale, the story of Enemy works on an allegorical level. What does this spider mean? What are they (all males) doing in the secret club? Why the female characters look so cold and detached?

You may interpret them in whatever way you want. The problem is that the film itself is too slow, caught up in its allegorical detail. Also, like in Blindness, another film based on Saramagos book, main characters reaction to this strange life-changing event is too unnatural.

Like I said, some would like to talk about the film for hours, discussing its details. Obviously Enemy is a kind of film that we have to see more than once to fully understand. Thats fine, but my question is, is it worth that? After all, you can do the same thing with anything you want.",1407369600,6,1678,4.726027397260274

However as much as I wanted to like it, the movie was a combination of perverse cultism, mysogyny and superficial sexist views towards women, and however much potential the end result is philosophical naval-gazing with a twist of sadomasochism. The idea of the doppelganger has long been around in European literature and is a fascinating topic to explore, but sadly this film almost took you there and then left the viewer with little but superficial gloss.combined with a Kafka-esque appearance of humans transitioning to insects( but unlike Kafka there is no backstory). and strangey ?  modern sleazy peepshows--.It had potential, but ultimately this film had poor direction and screenplay and was superficial pseudo-philosophizing and sorely lacking in any deeper meaning.

6280636,5,B00IKM5MIA,"AFTER TO WATCH IT , I WOULD LIKE TO READ THE BOOK .

Movie based in the book called ; The Double (Portuguese: O Homem Duplicado) is a 2002 novel by Portuguese author Jos Saramago, who won the Nobel Prize for literature. In Portuguese, the title is literally ""The Duplicated Man."" It was translated into English and published as The Double in 2004.

The Guardian said Saramago did not push the concept of the double far enough, noting that every culture plays with this idea. He wrote, ""Old as our fears, the familiar figure of the double haunts the literatures of every country.""[1] He says,

""Since the immutable laws of nature insist that something cannot exist in two places at the same time, a man and his double cannot both remain alive: one of the two must vanish for the order of the universe to be respected. It is no unfair disclosure to say that a death is the novel's conclusion.""[1]

John Banville in the New York Times wrote of The Double: ""His take on the theme is clever, alarming and blackly funny...""[2] Banville continues about Saramago's work: ""He has Kafka's petrified detachment, Celine's merry ferocity and the headlong, unstoppable style of the Beckett of Malone Dies and The Unnamable.""[2]

Jonathan Carroll of the Washington Post criticized Saramago, saying that he displays

""an obvious archness, an authorial sneer at the fantastical subject matter that quickly distances the reader from any emotional involvement with either the character or his situation. As a result, we don't care what happens to Afonso or how he ends up.""[3]",1407196800,3,1557,4.878787878787879

But it still was trying to be something it wasn't. It leads you down winding roads that make no sense but I hung in there..... Waiting for the tiniest bit of an ""answer"" or ""resolution ""..... Nothing came. At the end, I honestly felt like the point of the movie was to make a joke at the viewers expense. If you watch it from beginning to end, you just may agree. I'm just so disappointed in this movie.",1407110400,2,579,4.178571428571429
6280640,2,B00IKM5MIA,"There are plot reveals in this review.
Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Mlanie Laurent are favorites of mine, but I don't have anything good to say about the film (watched it all), but I gave it 2 stars because the acting is good, for the most part...the exception being the character of the prof that Jake plays. Bad direction.
The script, soundtrack, and direction are crap.
This is a film made by someone who regards himself as a maker of art films: atmospheric, puzzling, indecipherable... a very French flavor, and it includes French film's questionable, achingly slow plot development...mostly because they don't have much plot. This film has even less than normal. The pace is excruciatingly slow...but that's on purpose. The soundtrack is bad modern classical music. The choices made by the director, who also made a highly rated film--Prisoners, which I also disliked--are just NOT good.
And then there's the plot. This is like reading an amateurish, incomplete, short story. The ""doppleganger"" theme s a very, very old plot device which comes from German literature, and has been used in part or in full many times.
Finally, the last scene when Jake--playing his double--goes into the bedroom at the double's apartment and, for some reason God only knows, there is a massive, room filling spider facing him. Seriously?
This is a spin the dial film with random ideas and events chosen by spinning the arrow...one of which stops on a spider as big as a bedroom...side to side and floor to ceiling. ..which might be grinning. Sounds like at that point the film may have reached a classical absurdist moment, but no, it's not even that good.

6280654,3,B00IKM5MIA,"The one stars are a little harsh, but understandable. The pacing is so slow. The movie spends to  much time cryptically communicating to small section of people that it ignores the average viewer.  Okay so this is an art film? Is that what they call it?  So if you are folding laundry or something it's okay to watch while you look for the mate to your kids missing blue sock. There's a lot of quite time, watching Jake think, being depressed, pacing and stalking.  The movie varies slightly from the book...there's no hint to Eyes Wide Shut Sex cult in the book. You know this stuff really happens even amongst intellectuals. Anyway, the main characters in book and movie contact their doubles and the High Jinks ensues...very, very, slowly. This is a killing time kind of movie, so you won't be too annoyed by the end when you find the other blue sock, so not a total waste of time.

SPIDER SYMBOLISM:
There is lots of occultic symbolism. I'll address two main ones Spiders and Women.  Spider symbolism is associated with feminie wisdom. Spider and snake have similar negative symbolism as Spider is associated with having given humanity wisdom/alphabet i.e. Lucifer in the Garden of Eden. Per Spider represents creator, death, those caught in her web are those caught in the illusion of reality, her web can also symbolize tying up loose ends (not in this movie), The spider person has two speeds: motionless and lightning strike. The spider person can have a stinging bite when angered. Deceit is the negative side of spider personality. A web of rumors, gossip and lies can easily be woven. The person with spider energy may be ruthless and once incited to attack, the punishment is decisive and lethal. The doubles represent the above  mentioned dualities.  The above was sourced from (http://pure-spirit.com/more-animal-symbolism/664-spider-symbolism)

On the whole there may be some references unique to global or Hollywood occult beliefs of many people in Hollywood with sex cult, transhumanism?,  cloning of celebrities and people in general (if you've heard that rumor). But this is where the movie is not communicating to the rest of us...really.",1407110400,,2158,5.0027932960893855
6280655,2,B00IKM5MIA,"Big Jake Gyllenhaal fan here.  Love him.  Thought twice the Jake would make for a great movie.  Not so.  Even Jake couldn't save this one.  Neat premise, poorly executed.  I spent the whole movie confused.

I watched the director and Jake interview afterward, and I get that they wanted to make a different type of movie.  That's fine, as long as you don't want an audience to enjoy it.  Even they seemed confused.  I love twisty, turning thrillers that keep you guessing.  This wasn't that - I was guessing alright.  Guessing what the heck they were thinking.

And don't even get me started on the spiders.....",1407110400,6,611,4.650943396226415
6280656,4,B00IKM5MIA,"This movie isn't for those in search of a linear story line. It's complexity leaves you with either a satisfying desire to deduce your own interpretation through research and imagination, or it leaves you with a headache due to an inability to see past the curveball symbolisms. It's odd, there's no doubt about it; but, that doesn't warrant a one star review. Jake Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job as 2 interestingly unique characters that have a lot in common.",1407110400,,462,4.860759493670886
6280657,5,B00IKM5MIA,"As I write this, there are 160 1-star ratings for Enemy and it is clear these votes did not give the movie its due respect. Jake Gyllenhaal is a terrific actor and both Melanie Laurent and especially Sarah Gadon pull performances that are so methodical and well paced, perhaps the disappointment too many are feeling are due to generational gaps. I am 40, but I can distinctly remember music going from an album to the 8-track, to a cassette tape to CD's and with the invention of the iPod, music has gone digital. Digital downloads are fast and easy, but I appreciate digital more because I recall buying a CD for$18. Yeah. Each creation is great, but if you are not old enough to recall each invention, the appreciation of where music is is lost to you, always. If you did not climax immediately does not make the moment worthless, so how is this how Enemy is being judged? Particular elements are used profusely in movies that mainly speak to your mid and not your mind. Because many movies do not make it to the big screen, too many really good movies are often missed, but not because of poor performances and Enemy is no different. Think about this. For a man working to gain the affection of a woman, those encounters, if successful, bring similarities but different women can bring particular aspects of a man to the surface, some good and others, maybe not. This occurs with women hoping to gain the attention and affection of a man, as well. This movie could be viewed as one man or two, or as one man dealing with 2 aspects of himself, determining which of the split will win. When you meet someone, you want to show that winning side, and if it is considered good enough, the person will stick around, but the hidden parts will always surface, no matter how hard you try. In other words, you are your own worst Enemy. The actresses here, with Gadon's character being firmly aware of the '2',' pulls you in and makes the moments of this witness very believable. Laurent realizes something is amiss near the end, but the ending, it is sci-fi, it is shocking and it is scary. Hmmm. This does not seem to be so much a movie about having a clone, nothing close to that. But it is like having a dream and awakening from it to wonder why, why did you dream something that had you in it, doing things you have never done, probably have not thought about doing. I have heard it said that twins experience things, sense things about each other, even when very, very far apart. But that idea is squashed in one part of the movie so what is it? Some movies are very deserving of a 1-star rating, but Enemy does not belong in that category. Understand this, though: the prominent names in this movie chose to help make this movie for a reason, so please consider this and take the time to see what Enemy has to offer, to offer you. And what if there is another walking around who looks just like you, whose life would you prefer? Whose life is better? Do these opposites make him or her your Enemy?",1407110400,8,2997,4.431159420289855

But then it's just other things that don't make sense as well, in the middle of some hardcore love making you're gonna notice a ring around my finger? I'm sure they meant for some deeper thrilling message to be conveyed, but if you don't capture you're audience then you will never spread that message. A lot of people gave it 30 mins max but that's plenty of time and if they jumped ship it's because the film makers didn't do their job.

Sorry I left this in my queue for so long.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays Adam Bell, a mild-mannered History professor as well as his alter-ego, Anthony Claire, a third-rate movie star in the adapted from Jose Saramagos The Double screenplay. This has a similar dark and mysterious theme as Prisoners also directed by Denis Villeneuve and staring Gyllenhaal although Jakes varied and excellent acting ability is much more appreciated here.

The entire film has a yellow tint to it, helping to convey the desperation of not only the 2 male characters who are at a is that all there is part of their life, but of their lack of satisfying sexual lives with their female partners (excellently portrayed by Sarah Gadon and Melanie Laurent. The haunting soundtrack throughout by Saunder Jurriaans and Danny Bensi was exceptional at keeping my mind focused.

The opening sequence displays Chaos is merely order waiting to be deciphered and I loved being able to spot clues throughout the film in my attempt to decipher what turned out to be a bizarre ending. It took a few minutes for me to figure out the look on Bells face at the end until I flashed back to the opening sequence with Claire. Bells internalized sexual nightmare all made perfect sense but it sure was creepy from the Stanley Kubrick Eyes Wide Shut type-beginning to Bells creepy revelation at the end. I thought it ended too abruptly because I was totally immersed into the characters minds so I had kind of a is that all there is moment.

I happened to like to this one...and recently Jake has been choosing some great movie roles for himself.
These days there are three young actors from Hollywood who are standing-out from the rest of the crowd with
the movie roles they choose for themselves, and they are: Jake Gyhhenhaal, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ryan Gosling.

Enemy, is based on a book ""The Double"" (2002) written by a Portuguese author Jose Saramago.  I heard that the book is even
better then the movie.  But let me cut to the chase, the movie is about a young history professor (Adam) living in Toronto, Canada.
He leads a steady and boring life.  One day one of his co-workers recommends a movie for him. Adam then rents the film and watches it, he is quickly drawn to a scene where one of the actors playing a bellboy in hotel looks exactly like him. For the next days or so, Adam has problems sleeping and concentrating on his daily life routines, he finally decides to find out who the mysterious actor is...",1406332800,4,1079,4.546391752577319

It's the kind of movie that makes you ask a lot of questions and will really mess with your mind if you can get into it. Be prepared to switch your brain on for this one.

People can hate on this movie all they want. If they don't want to try and understand all of the film's nuances, then they won't understand the movie and will write it off as pretentious garbage. I've seen it twice now and I can't honestly saw I totally understand it, but that's part of the fun of watching these movies to me. I get to participate in figuring things out instead of having everything spelled out for me. Don't get me wrong, I love my straight-forward action movies too.

The characters' actions and the themes they raise are let's say, not for the faint of heart.

I enjoyed the film ""Donnie Darko"" even though that film itself has hidden meanings and can be confusing at times.  The weaving between scenes is annoying.  At the beginning of the film, they show him teaching his students  and the scene is almost repeated a few minutes later.  But the repeated scene is dull and makes you think it was thrown in as a filler.  His relationship with his girlfriend is strange.  The two never seem to connect emotionally only physically.

I think it is a European concept to tell a story with no ending and therefore pretend that it is deep and we need to debate the possible meanings and deep esoteric philosophic message, and really what it is is a story with no ending and I feel deceived and ripped off.  At least in Donnie Darko there is a debate between two or maybe three possibilities, but this story goes to such an abstract  abrupt conclusion that you think maybe you're just not smart enough to understand it. But in truth if you are smart enough, you will realize you didn't miss anything, it was just a cheap trick that robs us of a legitimate conclusion to what could have been a great story.

6280884,4,B00IKM5MIA,"I really liked this movie. Wish I knew what it was about.

Here's the scoop. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Adam, a history professor who is pretty much sleepwalking through life and has a relationship with his wife(?) that seems less than romantic. He watches a movie and recognizes that one of the bit actors looks way too much like him. He sets out to track the actor down and what he finds turns the creep scale on its ear.

I like these kinds of movies and this style seems to be on the rise with films such as ""Under the Skin,"" ""Upstream Color"" et al. This is really eerie. It's set in Toronto with a sickly green mist everywhere. Most of the architecture shows little style so the viewer feels they're in a lifeless, grey world. The really creepy stuff starts when Adam meets his lookalike Anthony.. Things go way beyond just looking alike. Then there is the similarities in their wives and past girlfriends/ spouses. There are a thousand subtle touches and strong use of leit motif, particularly that of spiders, that keep teasing the viewer's mind. The music score added to the creep factor as well. This is all just very unsettling, and when you get to the final shot, you're about ready to throw it all out the window and jump after it.

Gyllenhaal does a great job in both roles. The perspective wives are also good. Isabella Rossellini might have been good given a few more lines to chew. The cinematography, color palette, lighting and editing were all of professional grade. It all puts a heavy, ominous weight on the viewer's shoulders.

6280961,5,B00IKM5MIA,"Thought-provoking movie.

I am sure the author from which this movie was made, Saramago, doesn't even realize what he wrote. The movie is a confusion of several elements. First of all, the 'spider' motif plays throughout the whole movie. From the beginning sex-scene a spider is presented, then you see a giant spider hovering over the city and a cobweb around the city. Then the movie confuses us with the history teacher lecturing about what is control....the Spider is the metaphor for control. The 2 men are the flies in film. The spider is the woman, the city, the apartment and all the environmental accoutrement, from clothing they wear, the car they drive and the place they live.

Then the movie follows the lives of 2 men, who might be really the same person, one is a dark alter-ego with strange sexual tastes and the other is a mild-mannered and repressed history professor. As the movie goes on the complexity of the movie explodes, into a intricate psychological web, and reality of the 2 men become blurred as different realities merge into one. Are these 2 men identical men or the same person? Isabella Rossini, who plays the mother gives us a clue when she says ""You have a respectable job and a nice apartment, why don't you give up your 3rd rate acting job?"" This poses a conundrum now.  Are they 2 separate flies trying to switch places or the same one?  What is the answer? You decide....

I can see why a lot of people here criticize this ending as the worst they have every seen, because the movie was set in a realistic manner and suddenly it becomes a Kafka-esque ending. Saramago presents a masterpiece work of fiction from his unconscious mind....the problem is no one wants to use their brains to figure out what has happened.

6280993,5,B00IKM5MIA,"Wow, looking at the other reviews, people are all over the place on this film. From the lovers to the haters, there are some seriously different perspectives and explanations for the surreal events of this cerebral and suspenseful thriller.

So this film is definitely NOT for people who want an easy, straight-foward movie. I'd say offhand it's closest to something like a Lynch film. But while I generally detest Lynch's work as taking far too many liberties with curveball nonsense to pad the strangeness of the experience with weird for the sake of weird, I find this film to be almost the opposite - It is still a strange and haunting film, yet possesses a much more serious and singular tone while being driven by a very precise logic. But even the most minute details have been designed to provoke fierce discussion and examination.

The score is astounding one of the best I've ever heard, with restless strings and horns filling the silence, where even the most mundane scenes have a palpable sense of mystery and fear.

Once you get into things, there's just so much to love:
- Nonlinear storytelling
- Intense, ubiquitous symbolism
- Every line of dialog hides bits of code that support the major themes of identity, fidelity, oppression and morality.
- One of the wildest endings in all of film
- Flawless cinematography and production design
- Great acting
- The strange blend of its insane plot makes for a very unique experience from the usual Hollywood fare.

In the tradition of other mind-bending masterpieces like ""2001,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" and ""Jacob's Ladder,"" the viewer may not immediately know exactly what happened and why, but the right kind of audience who is game for artistic and head-scratching puzzles will enjoy piecing everything together.

My personal SPOILER explanation of the film:

There are 3 different tricks that are possibly happening throughout the film:
1) The chronology is out of order. Say, the car accident is really at the beginning, the club sequence is at the end, all feeding into the idea of the inevitable doom of history repeating itself a loop.
2) There is only one protagonist torn into 2 schizophrenic identities. One is weak and tender, the other aggressive and brutal. Both try to reconcile themselves over the duality of faithfulness versus infidelity. Example: how both men have the same photo in their possession.
3) The alien spider-women have imprisoned men in a fake reality. Sure, the spiders may all be metaphors for trapping him. Or maybe they are actually real too. For example, there's one shot of a giant spider-creature looming over the city, which doesn't seem like it should be his psychotic imagination but an objective shot of the landscape. If you want to explain the insane ending, this is the craziest yet most obvious way to do so.

So while most movies settle for just one trick, this movie actual has several. While I understand how this kind of narrative overload might offend some, I believe it is majestic and ambitious to try and do so many things at once.",1404345600,10,3040,4.868471953578337

6281054,5,B00IKM5MIA,"I just finished reading all 17 pages of reviews currently available for this film here on Amazon, and it just further cements my opinion that this a fantastic movie. To see the vitriol spit in either direction from the 1-star review yokels to the 5-star review brainiacs just fills me with joy. And they all say the same thing! The one-star reviewers accuse the movie and anyone who enjoys it of being pretentious and just trying to sound smart, while the five-star reviewers accuse the one-star folks of being stupid and lowest common denominators. Both sides are probably right to a certain extent.

But just seeing how huge the gap is between those that love this film and those that hate it proves to me that this a quality piece of filmmaking. It is challenging stuff, no doubt, and not easy entertainment. But not all entertainment has to be spoon fed drivel with obvious plot points you've seen a million times before. A lot of people can find entertainment value in this kind of esoteric mind-puzzle for the exact reason that it engages your brain and makes you draw your own conclusions. I know I personally enjoy this type of film because it is so uncommon this day and age. You gotta seek it out, as no major studio is gonna release it in 4000 theaters. But boy oh boy is it worth it. Kept me thinking about it long after it was over, and i immediately bought the book to help decipher all the implications (doesn't help btw, they're their own beasts).

So yes, many people will continue to hate this movie.

The actors move wordlessly through the vaguely futuristic suburbs of Toronto, estranged from their landscape and from each other. I kept wanting to yell at them, ""Say something! Don't Act! Interact!"" But it doesn't happen.

In the bonus ""Making of"" feature on this DVD, the movie's director said that, like all good directors, he completely disregarded the book that this material was based on. He made it anew. In a way, I understand what he meant. Material has to be completely re-imagined to work in another medium. But although I haven't read the award-winning book this film was based on, I believe it has to be better than what got translated onto the screen.

I also objected to the roles played by the three women here. Again in that ""Making of"" bonus feature, the actresses playing these roles praised their characters as being strong, determined women. I couldn't see that at all. Each of these women was given only a handful of words to say. Other than that, they were generally just left to themselves float in worried, estranged silence through their scenes. Most of the time, they were mannequins in service to whatever was the tacit need of the men in their lives.

There is some puzzlement here that challenges the viewer, as all surrealistic images tend to do. But I would have liked more of the artful, less of the artsy. Unless you are a fan of art-house film, you might not want to gamble on this. You might not want to double-down - but simply fold.",1403913600,,1554,4.705882352941177

I enjoyed ENEMY but understand the negative reviews. Those who want a really solid storyline that makes complete sense will definitely NOT enjoy it. Still, I'm a little surprised that the overall rating is this low. The overall rating on IMDb, btw, is quite high: 6.9 as of today.

ENEMY is a strange, solipsistic, rather Kafkaesque Canadian production based on a novel by Portuguese author Jos Saramago. Introverted history professor Adam Bell, well-played by Jake Gyllenhaal, discovers his apparent doppelganger in B-movie actor Anthony ""Daniel"" St. Claire. Bell's girlfriend and St. Claire's pregnant wife--similarly well-played by Mlanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon respectively--also bear a more-than-passing ""incidental"" resemblance to each other. After a brief stalking by Bell, the two men meet and discover that they are indeed perfect facsimiles of each other. They both try to keep things congenial and then go their own ways, but that, of course, simply cannot happen. The first hour of this dark, humorless film is pretty draggy, but some weird and unexpected stuff happens in the last 30-40 minutes. A lot's open to interpretation, but ENEMY's whole conflict, it seems, has two basic possibilities that I won't give away.

Would we like each other? (And how much do we like ourselves?) Would we want to trade places?""

While definitely not for all tastes, ENEMY is nothing if not different. Though the budget was obviously low and the scope is limited, it's generally well-produced. One final thing: I can't make up my mind about the constant synthesized drum-rolls and ""mm-MMMMB!"" sounds. Though they add suspense to this simple but intriguing film, sometimes it seems that less would be more here.",1403740800,,2098,5.546875

6281078,5,B00IKM5MIA,"I blind bought this because I liked Prisoners and the trailer very much appealed to my style of film. It is a very deep and thought provoking film. There is a lot to take in, much to view and even times to pause and think about what is happening. In the end, I let the credits roll and just sat and thought. Then I understood what the film was all about. Very cool style and brilliantly filmed and acted by all involved.

The PQ is decent, but a little inconsistent at times. There are some extremely sharp shots, however some of the darker scenes seem cloudy or not as dark as they should be. There were a lot of filtered shots, hazing and other film techniques used, so much of that could have been intentional. The audio is decent, however even when blasting there were a few lines which seemed muffled or too low. Again, maybe intentional.

The extras are short and simple, which I am fine with for a movie like this. There is simply a behind the scenes documentary.

This movie is very odd and probably not like anything you've seen before. again, it can be taken many ways. Some may not be able to get through half of it because it's just too weird, however I loved it an couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I feel this movie is geared more toward men, and I can relate to both Jake Gyllenhaal characters. Women, which have been with men who have been in these situation may also be able to relate. There are two strong female characters in this as well as a wonderful performance by Isabella Rossellini as the mother.

Rated R for nudity/sex and some language. The dislike for this film is by those who never took the time to understand it. I understood it and it touched me and I related to it. It's not all about spiders. Watch it and you will discover what the spider is to the character(s). Think about it before you hate it. Hating something usually means you don't understand it.

As usual, NEVER watch the behind the scenes or making of before the movie, only after!!!

The only thing this movie said was two guys look exactly alike and sound alike. One is a perverted creep, the other is a withdrawn, anal teacher.  That is it.  When the wreck happened, the scene goes to the apartment where the teacher has spent the night with his look-alike's wife, the actor has twisted it to where he takes the teacher's girlfriend on a one-night motel stay...she sees the tan line where his ring was, she freaks out screaming ""who are you, don't touch me"".  They die in a car crash, at the actor's home, the teacher walks into the bedroom asking the wife a question and there is a huge spider that fills the room....goes to black.

This is a complete waist of time and I was po'd that I had wasted valuable time on it.  Kale Gyllenhaal is becoming a washed up actor.  Continue these kinds of movies and his name will disappear.",1403568000,4,1039,4.369791666666667

6281119,2,B00IKM5MIA,"""Enemy"" is a collison of an art house film and thriller which means that, while it does have suspense, it is of the slow cooking variety. Nevertheless, ""Enemy"" fails to be a cohesive film in my opinion and while there are parts of it I enjoyed, the over all impact is less than the sum of its parts.

The arty elements aren't a problem with the film but it's the execution and lack of strong character development/pacing that undoes the film. The turgid pacing and heavy handed symbolism of the film does it no favors and, without a strong, compelling narrative ""Enemy"" just isn't all that involving.

SPOILERS:

Jake Gyllenhaal stars plays two parts in ""Enemey""; He plays a professor named Adam teaching political science at a University and plays his double a small time actor named Anthony. When the Adam sees the Anthony in a film, he becomes obsessed with finding out who this person is and if they are anything like him. They have parallel but differing lives and are very different in terms of personality. Once they finally meet Adam decides he can't handle it and breaks off any further discussion but Anthony now becomes obsessed with Adam and his life. He insists that Adam switch lives with him briefly.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Enemy"" is largely sustained by a terrific pair of performances from Gyllenhaal and while the director Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners"") stages his scenes well, the film doesn't built with any sense of momentum to its unusual (but not unexpected) conclusion. The idea of doubles has been done before on TV, films (""The Man Who Haunted Himself"" most notably) and less literarily in ""Strangers on a Train"" among others. Villenuve uses heavy handed symbolism (particularly the recurring motif of the spiders) and fails to develop his secondary characters which works to the disadvantage of the film--if you don't care about either of the main characters or the premise, you'll find yourself bored.

While ""Enemy"" has its moments mostly due to Gyllenhaal's performance, it fails to gel as an effective thriller.

Not something you can watch over and over, but something you'll be glad you watched, and may later watch again at least once.

I get the impression that all of the characters know bits and pieces about what's going on but, unlike most movies where everyone thinks out loud 100% of the time, they are tight-lipped about them because they're trying to figure things out themselves.  I also got the feeling that the story isn't really linear, so much as circular.  If you need to always know what's going on (or at least find out definitively what WAS going on by the end of a film), this movie is not for you.  Also, I imagine most people would consider this movie slow and/or boring.

6281134,1,B00IKM5MIA,"Usually I give movies the benefit of the doubt. But there isn't much good to say about this movie. Unfortunately, the movie came off as trying to be too smart and cool for its own good. This wasn't helped much by seeing the star and director declare that the movie was about the ""subconcious"". Oh my goodness, aren't they just tooooo smart for us. Except for the fact that anyone who knows much about psychology knows that the ""subconcious"" isn't even accepted as a valid term. I am a PhD and study cognitive processes, we refer to the term ""unconcious"" or ""automatic thinking process"" as a way to capture that not everything we do is done with a tremendous amount of forethought. But the idea that anyone can conceptualize (let alone create a movie about) unconcious thought processes is at best New Age BS or psuedo-intellectualism. And the fact that it includes large arachnids is laughable and absurd.

Now normally I would even give an absurd movie a decent review. But not one that takes itself so seriously and has so many other shortcomings. Beyond the obvious absurdity of the movie, the acting was wooden and the cinematography was horrible (there is a difference between gray - the other movie with Villenueve and Gyllenhaal, ""Prisoners"", gets it right - and simply out of focus and fuzzy). This was definitely a one-star effort. Don't waste your time on this.",1402963200,3,1371,4.760504201680672

The most entertaining points were the occasional intertwining of a spider theme on things like the windshield of the crushed car.  But if a movie is so bad you spend most your time wondering how the actor could put up with such a long beard in LA there is a problem with the premise.

6281202,5,B00IKM5MIA,"I can honestly say that Ive never seen a film quite like Enemy.  Ive been sitting on this review for the better part of a week (or two) trying to mull over in my head all the things that could possibly be said about it without looking at anything that anyone else has said about it, because at the end of the day (or at least for a reviews purpose) Id like these ideas and these thoughts to be my own.

What is weird is that what I take away from a film like Enemy almost seems too simple.

Sitting down to watch Enemy, I had a lot of conflicting feelings.  First, I was fresh off of a very disappointing experience with Prisoners, which was one of my least favorite films from 2013.  I had zero faith in Denis Villeneuve as a director, and yet the many, MANY faults with Prisoners lied more in the script than anything else.  And in that regard, this film was an adaptation of a novel by Jose Saramago, and while I have NOT read this particular novel, I have read Blindness and that novel was exceptional.  The film version was not, but there was at least hope here.  So, I was torn, but all the favorable responses to the film made me really anxious to see how it all came together.

Im still not sure how it came together, but it came together and I kind of loved it!

The premise is simple.  Adam, a teacher, stumbles across his doppelganger in a movie and becomes obsessed with tracking him down.  Turns out, his other self is an actor with a pregnant wife and a penchant for infidelity and soon after meeting this double, named Anthony, becomes consumed with taking advantage of Adam any way he can.  What isn't simple is the way that the visual coexists with the subliminal to create a story that feels so layered and so deep and so profound and yet so hard to put your finger on.

For me, Enemy is the struggle for self-identity.  I never once saw this as the story of two men but as the story of one man trying desperately to come to terms with who he was, and exploring every facet of his personality to the point where they splinter and take on their own lives, threatening to derail his very existence.  The way that the two mens worlds start to blend together in ways that almost place them inside these worlds, even when they don't belong (I think the scene with the mother is very telling) helps formulate this idea in my mind, for it establishes an inconsistency that feels purposeful.

But I understand that this is just one mans opinion.

The great thing about Enemy is that it honestly feels like a deep pool of discussion.  The only other film this year that felt this polarizing, but in a good way, was Noah.  Both films share the ability to deliver ambiguity in a way that feels meaningful.  Noah was far more straightforward than Enemy, and the basic themes are pretty clear, but both film really rely on personal audience interpretation to make the needed impact.  Enemy delivers strongly here, for it feels like an open-ended discussion, which helps make a personal connection to the audience.  Many will walk away dumbfounded, especially because of that final frame, but that dumbfounded feeling should turn into a yearning for answers, answers that only you can provide.

The film is propelled by Villeneuves dialed in direction, coaxing so much atmosphere out of every frame and creating a feeling that overwhelms in all the right places.  Couple that with a very strong ensemble, and an especially strong performance by Jake Gyllenhaal (his career best?) that shows so many shades not just to the characters but to the story itself, and you have a really vibrant film that will stay with you and continue to haunt and prod at your mind.",1401408000,2,3665,4.483433734939759

I also thought that the cinematography and the score added a lot to the overall atmosphere, with a dingy yellow tint on most of the scenes and moments punctuated with dissonant strings. It all contributed to an aura of mystery and disorientation, which I loved. Since the movie is quite ambiguous, it seems that the viewer will be rewarded with multiple viewings.

The not so good: plods along too slowly and could really use more humor, or even just more energy.  Though mostly on purpose the gloomy murky mood and pace gets to much at some points.

6281283,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Enemy is a weird movie that uses a typically non-threatening theme (doubles) and turns it into a taut, psychological showdown between two men defending their identities. This is director Denis Villeneuve's 2nd outing with actor Jake Gyllenhaal after last year's Prisoners, also starring Jake. Make no mistake, Enemy's budget is tiny in comparison and is completely different in story and style.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays a dual role, as both bumbling history prof Adam Bell and 3rd-rate actor Anthony Claire. They are, for all intents and purposes, identical in every single way. Adam's naive curiosity leads him to discover this doppelganger, who pops up as an extra in a random movie recommended by a friend. When the two meet in person, Anthony seizes the opportunity to demolish Adam's life.

The plodding soundtrack and hazy-yellow color palette reek of equal parts confusion, dread, and fear. Adam's struggle with his double is reminiscent of Fight Club, where narrator Ed Norton projects his split personality onto a non-existent character played by Brad Pitt. In this way, Anthony Claire is Enemy's outspoken response to Adam Bell's inherent sheepishness. By the time the two characters collide to bring an end to each other's unique existence, the film screeches to a roaring halt in one bizarre final scene.

This is a difficult movie to grasp for non-movie goers, and many reviews will tell you this. Watch close to spot how the director interweaves spider life into the various scenes; the symbolism is best left open to interpretation by Denis Villeneuve himself. If you enjoy slow-building psychological flicks, give this one a shot. It's an insightful look into the paranoid mind.",1400198400,,1692,5.190476190476191

6281289,3,B00IKM5MIA,"the last scene of this film is completely inexplicable to me. since it unravels everything that went before it, i have to keep to the basics.

gyllenhaal plays dual roles: an apparently affluent but underemployed actor living in a luxury toronto apartment with his sexy and pregnant wife, and a reclusive college professor living alone in a dumpy apartment except for occasional recreational visits by his sexy girlfriend. the actor and professor are physically exactly alike. when the professor notices his doppelgnger while watching a movie at home, he systematically tracks him down, arranges a meeting, and then thinks better of the whole thing. the actor is at first pretty wary of this stalker but then, meeting the professor and discovering that his girlfriend is quite tasty, decides the situation has potential. one thing leads to another, as discovering your identical twin often does ... and i don't care how smart you think you are, right up to the end you will never guess the last scene of this movie, even if you can explain it after you've seen it.

everything is bathed in dim yellow light, up there in toronto, and boy do things move slowly from one plot point to the next; you might even think the dreamlike pace was intentional. the most watchable aspect is not the two attractive female leads but the clever way gyllenhaal embodies the twins by subtle but distinct differences in posture, gait, voice, glance and affect. it's a virtuoso performance.

despite that, the plot has several inexplicable holes, such as why this bit actor can afford fine clothes, a racing motorcycle and that luxury apartment, or why he has a special chrome key that lets him attend dark private clubs where naked models crush obese spiders with their high heeled shoes. unless it has something to do with that last scene.",1399248000,15,1821,4.88673139158576

I laughed at one customer review...something about how he/she expected more from Jake Gyllenhaal, who ""is usually good in his movies"" or something like that.  As if he wasn't brilliant in this one, too!  Hilarious!  I purchased this from vudu this morning and was blown away by the creativity!  Obviously this film isn't for everyone, but cerebral types will certainly enjoy the look and feel.  The movie is an experience.  It makes you ask questions.  It doesn't lay everything out there for the unintelligent.  I imagine that's why some are saying it's a waste of time.",1399161600,2,616,4.79047619047619

6281354,5,B00IKM5MIA,"This is an open-ended (described as a ""spiral"") story that can be interpreted in several ways and will leave you with more questions than answers. If you are looking for something linear, look elsewhere.

This work has a cult classic feel to it. That doesn't mean it will become a cult classic, but if you like slightly dark, mysterious, medium-paced, ""think pieces"", then give this one a try.

I especially liked the audio. It's overboard, but really adds to the edgy feel of this movie.",1398556800,106,488,4.729411764705882
6281355,5,B00IKM5MIA,"Dark and twisty, Enemy will mess with your mind and if you like this type of movie, it will have you re-watching for all the subtle clues and hints that help to explain the story. I say ""help to explain"" because ultimately, there is no simple, straight-line narrative to follow as you think about what you watched. Filmed in a hazy, brownish-yellow tint, it feels as sinister and creepy as a nightmare as you follow history teacher Adam Bell on a frightening journey that even he cannot explain. Jake Gyllenhaal in the dual roles of Adam and his exact double Anthony (an actor) is incredible. How can two identical men - who have never met each other - be so different in every aspect of their personalities? Something is going on in all this murkiness that Anthony's wife finds deeply disturbing, much more so than her husband's usual casual infidelities. The final shocking, eerie scene may leave an indelible image burned into your brain - and send you back for another viewing when you try to put all the pieces together. The best approach to this movie may be to experience it on an emotional, psychological level rather than as just another, albeit superior, thriller.",1398556800,104,1174,4.7317073170731705
6281356,4,B00IKM5MIA,"Ok, so I was annoyed for a while by the moody, slow pace, the minimalist dialog, the yellow/green monochromatic world, and the confounding weirdness and uncertainty. The ending came quick and shocking like a guillotine. But after it was over we found ourselves talking about it and I woke up today still pondering it even more - and so right there fits my primary criteria of a good movie, or good art.

In comparison to the fast-paced, heavily-plotted, and crystal-clear, unambiguous messages of most other movies we've all been numbed into expecting, ""Enemy"" is really refreshing. God forbid I'm not handed the moral of the story all wrapped up in a neat bow and, gasp, I'm forced to think for myself. Having to ask, ""what was THAT all about?"" does a soul good once in a while.

And so perhaps the meaning of the movie is the style of the movie itself: There is no real answer, and so the viewer can never fall under the control of the totalitarian state the professor character warns about. We are free and in control of our own thoughts and beliefs about the movie.

Ok, maybe that all sounds insufferably heady and not your cup of tea tonight - no problem. I'm just saying I actually appreciated a little ambiguity and provocation in my entertainment.",1398470400,,1256,4.648648648648648
6281357,1,B00IKM5MIA,"With any thriller the most exciting part of the film is to see how it comes together at the end.  Enemy instead chooses to raise many questions, with the goal of never answering them.  After watching the film for an hour, I felt I had been tricked into watching Gyllenhaal stare at a mirror for an hour.  The film gave me the same gut reaction as watching a horrible scary movie.  You keep asking yourself why the characters are choosing to act the way they do, even though no regular human would.  The only slightly redeeming factor of the film is it's cinematography .  Besides for that its garbage.  I wish I could give zero stars.  Do yourself a favor, and choose any other movie on movie night.",1398297600,8,699,4.40625

It is the kind of film that makes you want to go on forums and online chats and discuss your theories and interpretations with others. The acting is fantastic with Jake Gyllenhaal giving two incredibly nuanced performances. The directing also deserves some serious praise here. Denis Villeneuve once again proves himself to be a masterful director with a great eye for shot composition, color pallet, great use of zooms and rack focusing, and overall fantastic control of the story. With a less competent director, this movie could have easily been an incoherent art-house mess, but with Villeneuve at the helm was a stellar thriller. I also feel that the score for this film is a bit underrated. The music never feels overbearing or out of place, and it adds a lot to the intensity or the creepiness of certain scenes which I will not spoil here. With the parking sounds of string instruments, it feels like a mix of classic film scores from the 60's and 70's and modern horror films.
