8150611,5,B000JJ4WF6,"FMP TSR is the 3rd season of FMP. It follows FMP, and FMP Fumoffu. The animation quality is way better in this season than in the previous 2. All of the characters return and so do the Arm Slaves. The AS's are even more awesome in TSR. The voice actors are all the same and the music is still great. My only complaint is that the ending leaves you hanging really bad. It pretty much ends with all sorts of bad guys ready to pounce and the team of the TDD ready to take them on. I loved this series but was very disappointed by the ending. Ive been waiting for them to end it for years, but no luck. I still have hope though. Even though it's not resolved this anime is incredible. You should definitely give it a look see.",1353888000,,722,4.091549295774648

8150613,5,B000JJ4WF6,"No, I am not saying that this was a horrible disc and you shouldn't buy it. I am saying this because all three episodes on this disc are very gloomy. I will give a quick summary of each episode.

Episode 8:

After Sousuke is giving orders to stop protecting Kaname Chidori and return back to the Tuatha de Danaan (or TDD-1), he is in for a rude awakening. First, he stops by to see the submarine commander Teletha Testarossa (Tessa for short) who pretty much tells him that she gave the green light for Sousuke to return to the submarine-which means stop guarding Chidori-and start piloting the Arbalest full-time. Sousuke in his usual way disagrees, but doesn't come right out and say it. This causes Tessa for an outburst (tears included) and Sousuke just clamps up. From there, Sousuke meets his new Lieutenant and fails horribly at the test the new Lieutenant gave him.

Episode 9:

Switch back to Kaname and see how she's doing. Well, she starts to suspect that someone is following her and decides to man up (or girl up in her case) and confront them. After getting a hotel room with a complete and total stranger, she gets to meet Mithril Intelligence Agent ""Wraith""(F.Y.I. this ""guy"" is actually a girl). Wraith then tells her yes, she has been following her, but so as someone else. Enter Xia Yu Lan, the younger twin, who shoots Wraith and goes after Kaname. She attempts to kill Kaname, but fails after falling for an old trick in the book. Then enter Leonard Testarossa, Tessa's brother and a fellow Whispered. He orders his bodyguard (mini-AS) to kill Xia Yu Lan. And finally, he does the stupidest thing any guy could ever do-kiss Kaname on the lips...which leads to him getting slapped. And Kaname having a breakdown because Sousuke wasn't there to comfort her...like usual

Episode 10:

Mitrhril is sent to Hong Kong to stop a rogue AS unit. (You get background on Melissa Mao) After reviewing possible scenarios, Mithril orders Melissa and her comrades on a very simple-yet tedious-mission: Search for the AS...not fun. Anyway, Melissa teams up with Sousuke, as they are passing through various checkpoints, Sousuke screws up royally by not focusing on the road (rather on his situation) and causes a traffic accident. Luckily, the AS shows up, kills a few guys and runs. Melissa and Sousuke get back in the van, with Melissa telling Sousuke that she doesn't wanna be responsible for his death and needs to man up. But instead of the usual Sousuke accepting the situation for what it is, he says okay and gets out of the van. Leaving the viewer (you) with a very simple question: What is Sousuke going to do?

Overall, I think I would have to say that this DVD is very dark compared to the other two. But it is a must buy because you get to see Tessa reveal how she feels about the ""love triangle"", Kaname finally revealing how she feels about Sousuke, and Sousuke finally realizing that though being a solider is great,its nice to have someone in your life who cares about you for WHO you are, not WHAT you are...",1173744000,4,3031,4.643656716417911
8150614,5,B000JJ4WF6,"To begin with, I will try to give a detailed and overall plot summary of the entire series -as much as it is possible- without giving to many spoilers away but SPOILERS WILL BE INCLUDED! Therefore, if you don't want to be given anything away to you, than do not read further.

First of all, as I described the first season this series have something for everyone and I do recommend them to anyone!

To the story:

First of all, the story starts where the first season ended (with a few `modifications' made). The anime begins with Mithril being involved in military attacks in the Baltic region while its leader has acquired advanced weaponry technology anti-ECS missile (missile able to detect systems with ECS invisibility). In order to protect hellicopters filled with refuges Sousuke must use the the Arbalest's Lambda Driver, which he still tries to learn how to control. Later on, the viewer will be introduced to the main villain of the series, Gates, who is a member of an organization called Amalgam and basically opposes Mithril and was the one which provided the leader of the Baltic nation with the advanced weaponry. We are also introduced to Xia Yu Fan and Xia Yu Lan, twin sisters who we later learn were raised by Gauron.

After a school side-story, the next mission takes us to Nanjiing, so that Mithri can safe hostages. There, Mao wil hide between the hostages by pretending she is one of them, will have to fight against Xia Yu Lan; Kurz Weber (who is piloting the only Zy-98 Shadow-type Arm Slave in the battle) will have to fight against Xia Yu Fan and Sousuke (who asked to take a M9 instead of Arbalest was denied because he is the only one who can operate the Arbalest and the Lambda Driver) will be left alone with the unreliable Lambda driver to deal with Gates, who is operating a Venom-type Arm Slave. During this battles we will also witness some betray going on (sorry guys, if I say more I will take the suspense away).

Yet, we should also not forget that a love-story between the two main protagonists is going on which will become apparent during Sousuke's constant absences from school and that Kaname becomes worried about him in many aspects; while Mao will start to worry about him as well. Sousuke, starts to reflect upon his own feelings about Kaname and would prefer to remain a student by her side instead of being a soldier etc. Furthermore, and going through various `misinterpretations' that Sousuke Sagara usually does, Kaname and him get closer and he realizes how much Kaname is depending on him. The specific episode ends when Sousuke (who is beginning to realize his feelings for Kaname) is ordered to withdraw from guarding Kaname immediately, with all guard duties being entrusted to another agent, codenamed ""Wraith.""

After being called back, Sousuke falls into a slight depression, not wanting to pilot the Arbalest and wishing he were back at Jindai High. We are introduced to the new Uruz-1, Lieutenant Belfangan Groseaux. He tests Sousuke's ability with the Arbalest, a test Sousuke fails miserably. Meanwhile Kaname is becoming increasingly suspicious that someone is following her. She discovers that Sousuke has left for good and realizes she is now completely alone. She decides to find out who is following her, and through a series of events discovers Wraith, who informs her that aside from himself, someone else seems to be following her. We discover this person is Xia Yu Lan, the younger twin. She shoots Wraith and then attacks Kaname. Kaname escapes, but is pursued and manages to surprise Yu Lan and shoot her with a Taser. After this she is met by Leonard Testarossa, Tessa's brother and a fellow Whispered. He is an agent of Amalgam and has orders to kill Yu Lan. He orders one of his bodyguards (a miniature AS unit) to kill her. When this is done he expresses that he seems to have fallen in love with Kaname and steals her first kiss, which infuriates her. In exchange for her forgiveness, Leonard allows her to take back Wraith who seems to still be alive.

To make the long story short the viewer will follow the Mithril team to another mission, this time in Hong Kong, in which power games and betrays will go on and someone is piloting an AS unit eqiuped with a Lamda Driver as well. In terms of `performance' Sousuke will hit rock bottom and fails completely because he cannot concentrate due to reoccurring thoughts of Kaname. These distraction eventually cause him to crash the vehicle he is driving. Mao tells him she won't work with him unless he can focus. Sousuke realizes he can't and abandons the mission. Meanwhile tensions between North and South China force Mithril to order an assault on the enemy AS before it is found. While they battle the AS, Sousuke wanders through Hong Kong, eventually meeting a Chinese Woman who resembles Chidori. He goes with her to her apartment, most likely to have sex, but due to her appearance thoughts of Chidori constantly fill his mind; (don't worry, He decides to leave) ending up wandering in the streets and meets an old enemy who amongst other things tells him that Kaname died. Sousuke kills him, this time for good. Meanwhile, Mithril is in great need of Sousuke and Tessa orders that Sousuke is been send the Arbalest so that he can rejoin the team and defeat the enemy; but, his will to fight is gone. Without Kaname he is lost.

As Sousuke tries to leave he is confronted with Kaname, who used Wraith to find Sousuke. After beating him up she tells him he needs to pilot the Arbalest and save everyone. Feeling renewed confidence at seeing Kaname alive Souske finally realizes that he is the only one who can pilot the Arbalest and works together with the Al to fully make use of the Lambda Driver.

The final episode, is basically the climax of the show and when the main villain is about to kill everyone Sousuke arrives just in time, makes full use of the Lamda Drive and saves everyone.

The Second Raid ends with Sousuke finally understanding what he wants to do with his life: Pilot the Arbalest for Mithril and attend school with Kaname. He works out a deal with Mithril that allows him to do just that. We are left with both Kaname and Sousuke having realized their feelings for each other, but neither of them being able to admit it.

Now, a few details about the series besides the story:

- It is 13 episodes long but fully pacted with action, the viewer will go through an emotional rolercoaster, has many twists, solid story and is by far the strongest season of all three.

- The animation is even upgraded when comparing it with the first season

- Music and dub are perfectly orchestrated

- As for the price, a logical concern to everyone, well, it is the typical as the usuall price of anime (the price spectrum usually varies between 23 - 29 dollars.)

To sum up, if you liked the first and second season, than this one is defenitely highly recommended for you.

I hope that I could help ^_^",1170720000,7,6948,4.663398692810458
