6160924,5,B00HF95PKO,"The creme de la creme of anime.  This is what it's all about.  Hand-drawn, exquisitely detailed backgrounds and interesting characters.  Non-stop action, hot babes, cosmic battles, and a good dose of humor all mixed into the perfect blend.  The best short-run OVA's are MD Geist, Mad Bull, Violence Jack, and 80s Guyver.  The best long-running anime shows are Fist of the North Star and Space Cobra.  Do yourself - and your imagination - a big favor and pick this up if you like classic, hand-drawn anime that isn't ruined with computer effects and depressing events that are all build-up and no pay-off (ie, Attack on Titan).",1420156800,10,626,4.8584905660377355

6160926,5,B00HF95PKO,Classic Anime that is not for everyone. Think the original Flash Gordon movie in anime form. If that is your dream come true than order it. The animation is old but has the style of the comic and these are classic characters that influenced decades of anime.,1404691200,3,258,4.51063829787234
6160927,5,B00HF95PKO,"It's about time that this series was released over here.
Although the American episode is rather crummy, the voice
actor who does Cobra's voice (MICHAEL BELL) is a fantastic
voice actor, who has done decades of great characters.

Other than that, this set is phenomenal. My only quibble is I wish
they would have had voice overs for the days I don't want
to read English subtitles.",1398816000,2,381,4.686567164179104
6160928,5,B00HF95PKO,"I can't believe it is over 20 plus years since I first saw this in Japan. I can understand Japanese-- which means I like all my amine in original japanese language version. The other reviews are correct there is no English dubbed version on this set. Just has subtitles. If you can enjoy movies with subtitles--then you can definitely enjoy this one. It's like when I watch a French movie with subtitles--i still enjoy it. I have no real interest in the new anime that is out there. I watched some of them but ""something"" is lacking. My opinion---Nothing beats Lupin the 3rd, City Hunter, Future Boy Conan, City Hunter, Fist of North Star, Original Gundam, etc. I guess I like the classic anime. I waited so long for Space Cobra TV series to come out on dvd.",1396224000,4,758,4.5
6160929,5,B00HF95PKO,"Cobra is a character that lost some of his original charm when translated to English, so I don't mind there's no English dub. I love the show for Cobra being a womanizing prick that will take on anyone, and still remain likeable. There's plenty of classic action that will bring you back more than just your initial viewing of the episodes.
They transferred the episodes well, all are displayed and nice color and definition. Sure they split the 30 episodes between two collections which is expensive, but I've seen worse pricing with anime. Like when Gundam 8th MS Team was $20 for just four episodes.
Get it while you can, because I'm sure these won't be in print for a long time. You won't be disappointed unless you are a child that can't read fast enough, or you don't like good classic animation.",1395792000,3,802,4.615384615384615
6160930,5,B00HF95PKO,"The DVD is subbed, as promised, seeing that if anyone actually researched it, they would know that there never any plans to dub it. The subs are far more accurate than anything that could be torrented, and the picture quality looks fantastic for DVD. The picture comes in 4:3, looking crystal clear on my 21 inch. The extras come with a really neat interview from the creator of the series, and the... awful English pilot.

Considering this came out in 1982, it transcends most contemporary anime in detail and color, literally jumping off the screen. There are genuine moments of sadness and emotion as you become attached to characters with a less than happy fate. Get this before it goes out of print. This is a must see for newcomers and experienced fans. Every person deserves to see Space Cobra at least once in their life.",1394841600,15,829,4.678082191780822
6160931,3,B00HF95PKO,"I was so excited to see this was getting an American release. It looks awesome, sounds good, but it is not English dubbed as was advertised. Boo on you, Amazon for that. This was one of the biggest reasons I decided to pay the extra bills for an overnight delivery...",1394236800,5,267,4.36
6160932,3,B00HF95PKO,I Got this the second I saw English dubbed I was very disappointed the second I saw the case where it said eng sub not dubbed. The discription is misleading because the only part that is dubbed is the English Pilot in the extras and nothing else. I am bummed it wasn't what I expected but this is still a great series to have in your collection. I guess I still have to wait for the someone to gain some sense and dub this amazing anime.,1394150400,6,437,4.093023255813954

8632226,5,B00HF95PKO,a very underrated anime. probably one of the greatest of all time highly recomend it. even thought it was created in the early 80s it.s still ahead of this time,1496880000,,160,4.366666666666666
8632227,5,B00HF95PKO,"I got into this anime series by accident. I'm not really into anime that much just because I've never really invested time into it. The only anime I watched was Sailor Moon when I was a kid and I still am a fan of it today as a 26 year old. I would say this series is the first adult anime series I have watched as I've never seen any others and I've also never seen anime movies like Akira or Ghost in the Shell. I'll look into all of those eventually. I had already been listening to most of the Space Adventure Cobra soundtrack that I had come across back in 2012 when it was available on YouTube and was hooked by Yuji Ohno and Kentaro Haneda's production of jazzy, smooth music. I was already a Yuji Ohno fan because of his Lupin the Third soundtracks from the late '70s and early '80s. Well, this anime series was made available on YouTube by Nozomi Entertainment in 2014 but I found out about it just last month. I loved it and decided to buy both DVD sets. The animation is still supreme for its time and I love Osamu Dezaki's pastel freeze frames aka postcard memories; it just highlights the beauty of the animation. The only things I don't like is that most of the characters don't really have too much information about their background besides Cobra of course. We know about the Royal sisters and their tattoos but we don't really know more about their background.  Also each storyline for the episodes doesn't go too much in depth but each one is only about 25 minutes long so there isn't too much time. Either way it's an enjoyable series and I would say it does follow the manga pretty well. The movie didn't, though.  While watching this series I did get a late '70s, early '80s vibe from the animation, music, and just the looks of the characters (hairstyles, clothing, etc) which makes sense since the manga was published in 1978 and lasted until 1984. The series was from 1982-1983 so the early '80s still had some of that late '70s vibe just by once again looking at the clothing , hairstyles, and music.",1483315200,,2025,4.397333333333333
8632228,5,B00HF95PKO,"A fantastic mix of crazy action, stylish cinematic flair, and the occasional moment of reflection. I saw a review below stating that it ""needs better plot"", but I have to disagree. For what the series was trying to accomplish, the plot was always spot on. Whether Cobra was planning a heist, fighting the Pirate Guild, helping old friends, or even trying to take a vacation, the action was always varied enough to keep things interesting, and quite solid and satisfying. You were never really sure what kind of strange situations Cobra would find himself in, and the rogue gallery was chock full of memorable villains with fun designs and insane powers, each defeated by Cobra in very fun and creative ways. Sure, you could argue that the plot wasn't exactly high art, but why does it have to be? Why can't a series simply promise a fun adventure, and deliver on that promise in spades?

One final thing I'd like to mention is that I found Space Adventure Cobra to be refreshingly brave. Most anime (and television shows in general) have a hard time killing off characters. You know how it goes, the hero defeats the villain, and the villain scampers away only to pop up again endlessly in later episodes. However, Space Adventure Cobra has no problem with killing  off both heroes and villains. This creates quite a bit of suspense, since you're seriously never sure who will make it through the episode alive. It's a nice change of pace.",1473724800,,1439,4.729083665338646
