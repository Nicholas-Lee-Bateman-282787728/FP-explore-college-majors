5063093,5,B0077T5SWC,"The Route 66 drama series 1960-1964) beautifully captures the spirit of American in the 1960's.  The episodes are well written, great acting, and thought provoking.  It is the only series I know that was totally filmed on location throughout the country. There is no way that such a series could be produced today...just to darn expensive. Route 66 series, in my opinion, was best drama series in television history.  I am happy to see that Amazon is offering  the complete series....what a gift to those of us who originally saw the series many years ago.  It is a timeless treasure...and it will transform you to a time when America was at the height of its power, and posperity.  It was a great artistic achievement at time.  The series is still popular in Europe.  A great bargain in all ways.",1332028800,6,797,4.683453237410072
5063094,5,B0077T5SWC,"Many of us have been waiting a long time for season 4 of the classic TV series ROUTE 66, which can be described as ""two young men in a Corvette convertible traveling across the country in search of America and themselves."" Stirling Silliphant's great scripts for the series set me on the road to being a writer (FIRST BLOOD, Rambo). As a teenager, I wrote Stirling a letter about how he inspired me. He encouraged me, and years later he and I worked together on the NBC miniseries of my novel THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE. The stories are an intriguing combination of action and ideas. LSD, mercy killing, the hunt for Nazi war criminals, miscegenation, right-wing hate groups, the VIetnam War (in 1963!): these and similar topics were almost never dramatized on other series. But ROUTE 66 loved controversy. In fact, for the hate group episode, TO WALK WITH A SERPENT, the sponsors pulled out, but CBS alliowed the show to run without breaks (and with a lot of previews for upcoming ROUTE 66 episodes). Another episode GOOD NIGHT, SWEET BLUES featured Black actors, except for the two stars. The great jazz singer Ethel Waters received an Emmy nomination (at a time when no series had a continuing Black actor). Each episode was filmed entirely on location across the country (no studio shots). Nelson Riddle composed an original score for almost every episode. Well known directors such as Arthur Hiller, Sam Peckinpah, and Robert Altman worked on the series. The who's who list of guest stars includes Robert Redford, Suzanne Pleshette, Anne Francis, Joan Crawford, Buster Keaton, Lee Marvin, Michael Rennie, Dorothy Malone, and Robert Duvall. I'm not as enthusiastic about the Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, and Lon Chaney Jr. comedy Halloween episode LIZARD'S LEG AND OWLET'S WING as another reviewer expressed, but it is definitely a conversation piece, and its feminist sub theme is typical of the topics that Stirling Silliphant found interesting. I was glad to have Infinity's earlier release of the first 3 seasons, even with the problems of season one (the first attempt to release those episodes cropped the 4:3 image into 1.79) Some of those transfers were dark, also. For later seasons, there wasn't a list of which episodes were on which discs. But the episodes themselves are such treasures (a Smiithsonian-like depiction of the American landscape from 1960-64) that I forgave those problems. Let's hope that the Shout Factory gets it right, and no matter what, finally having season 4 with TWO STRANGERS AND AN OLD ENEMY, THE STONE GUEST (Silliphant's favorite script for the series), and LIKE THIS IT MEANS FATHER, is cause for celebration.",1329436800,114,2654,4.993227990970655
5063095,4,B0077T5SWC,"I was a so-so fan of ROUTE 66 until Season #3.  In my opinion, the best episode occurred on October 26th when Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney guest-starred on: ""Lizards Leg & Owlet's Wing!"" Talk about a perfect Halloween Treat!  Who would have expected Frankenstein, The Wolfman, Dracula, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame to appear in the same episode? This tongue-in-cheek hour gave Martin Milner a chance to take the lead over George Maharis...who was busy wooing 40 secretaries attending a convention. It also was filled with character actors--including Jeannine Riley, who became 1 of the original 3 sisters on the CBS TV Show: ""Petticoat Junction!""  A side note: this story was one of the earliest episodes which pointed out the unfair balance between men and women in the workplace.  I'm not suggesting that anybody purchase the entire series strictly for this, but if you don't have a problem with good acting, writing and direction...as well as black & white episodes...order the series NOW while the price is low.",1329436800,26,1031,4.976744186046512
5063096,3,B0077T5SWC,"I am so thankful to Shout Factory for giving me Season 4 of Route 66. I am hoping they can remaster Season 1 from the Infinity releases because some episodes were in bad condition. Although I already have seasons 1 to 3, I will fork out the money for this remastered set to get the 4th season.

As you can see, my hopes for a remastered season 1 are gone....So I give 3 stars because you gave me season 4, but oh how I wish you had of remastered season 1 properly.",1328918400,21,464,4.043478260869565
5063097,5,B0077T5SWC,"""Route 66"" has gone down in television history as being one of the most critically-acclaimed and beloved series of the 1960's. The show featured two men who travelled the United States in a Corvette convertible enountering various people with their problems that the duo helped solve. Starring Martin Milner as Tod and superhunk George Maharis as Buz, the one-hour drama was similar in theme to ""The Fugitive"" with the series' leads taking a back seat to that week's guest-stars who carried the bulk of the story.

 The show is also known for its beautiful cinematography (the show was filmed in at least 8 different states and two episodes were filmed in Canada), it's lush and memorable theme song and the fancy car the guys drove around in.

 George Maharis unfortunately left the series in early 1963 due to health problems and was replaced by Glenn Corbett (a future soap opera actor in ""The Doctors"") as Linc.

 The guest-stars was a who's who of Hollywood actors including Joan Crawford, Boris Karloff, Jack Lord, Susan Oliver, James Caan and even featured a young Burt Reynolds in a small supporting role.

 A total of 116 episodes of ""Route 66"" were filmed in its short four season run and are included here in this deluxe box set edition that will feature bonuses which will soon be announced. There are 24 discs.

5063098,5,B0077T5SWC,"I have decided to repeat my recent response to one of the negative reviews for my own acclaim for this product:

Wow, Todd, to say you are inordinately harsh would be an understatement.  What were you expecting here?  Transfers equivalent to Criterion's ""Dr. Strangelove"" blu ray or Arrow's ""Back Sunday"" (Bava)?  The sad thing about this scandalous take-down -and as a person I respect you for your good nature and desire to lead other buyers in the right direction- but I bought the set, received it a few days ago and have spent hours scanning every episode.  I am not a one time buyer, but a fanatical lifetime collector who graduated from Beta to VHS to laser-disc to DVD and to blu ray, and presently hold over 6,000 pieces in the latter two modes.  Whether or not Shout stayed the course with the Infinity masters or not is hardly the point methinks.  The overriding concern to all perspective buyers is that Shout has given fans of the show handsome transfers and the full run of the series to every last episode!  Where are these awful looking episodes?  Unless I am going blind I do NOT see them.  What I see are solid, detailed black and white presentations that are probably better than they were seen on television in those long ago days.  So very sad that your over the top burst of disappointment has cost the company some sales. Any true lover of this seminal series needs to ignore this misleading post and avail themselves of this great buy that will happily allow them to bring back the memories in pictorial splendor.  Unbelievable!  And no before I am accuse of it I do NOT work for Shout, I am a veteran 62 year old Jr. high school English teacher, who believes in justice.",1500854400,12,1695,4.554455445544554
5063099,5,B0077T5SWC,"This series is hauntingly good, even if it's a bit hokey at times. It isn't part of the commonly acknowledged classic TV, but it should be.",1499990400,,139,4.384615384615385
5063100,5,B0077T5SWC,"Great old series. If you've never seen it, you should give it a try.  Many big stars just starting out. And the Vette is nice as well.",1498521600,,134,3.962962962962963
5063101,2,B0077T5SWC,"Unfortunately the producers did not do any video quality improvements. I purchased the Alfred Hitchcock series and the video quality is so detailed you can see the fivers in the clothing. In this series (Route 66) it looks more like someone used a video camera to record the video from a television the quality is so poor. I am very disappointed in the video quality because the producers went the ""cheap route""",1498176000,,411,4.722222222222222
5063102,5,B0077T5SWC,"Tod and Buzz, for the first two-thirds of the series, and Tod and Linc for the third, search for the meaning of life in this philosophical, psychological, comedic, and at times tragic, road trip.  Typically the two men would roll into a town, find work and find themselves educationally and very often heroically involved in the story at hand.  Like a short story from literature, each episode offers an interesting insight, or reflection, on who we are, how we live our lives, and how we deal with our feelings.  Regardless of how the first half of our lives went, as noted in episode, Ever Ride the Waves in Oklahoma? ""It's the second half that counts.""  One doesn't need to be in the second half of their life to enjoy this thoughtful black and white show from the 60s.  The show's backdrop includes, but not limited to:

Learning about berrlyium, logging, mining, oil rigging, lobsters, date harvesting, luxury resort living, small towns, dust cropping, car racing, surfing, livestock auctioning, raspberries, downhill skiing, water skiing, boxing, gravel processing, jazz music, steel mills, chicken farming, rodeos, a kangaroo court, chorus dancing, speedboats, the old pacific ocean park, pro wrestling, marine life, sharks, cotton gins and the metaphorical meaning of mermaids.

Several of the quotes from the series are inspirational and life affirming.  Five of them as follows:

""... the reason we look for hate, is to protect yourself from love ... she's so hooked on getting back at people that she's lost herself somewhere. She's fallen out of the amour like the hermit crab and got lost - the armor that keeps marching and the sword that keeps swinging.  That's the trouble with fighting a war that you get so wrapped up fighting that you forget how to make peace ... Tomorrow she's going to ... maybe they deserve it or maybe they don't, but that's okay too just so she's not kidding herself, just so she doesn't blame them for whatever it was that made her come back here wearing that mask.  She's got no alibi, that's all, no reasons why, or things to blame: environment, heredity, all that trauma jazz, and lousy education and lousy luck and parents that don't dig; all excuses, excuses ... maybe nobody ever told her that, when the doctor slaps you and you scream, you're on the scene, we're free. From that moment on, the choice is ours."" (ep:  Love is a Skinny Kid)

""Look.  We're all in a war, the same war.  We're vets. I mean somebody cuts the cord and holds you up by the heels and slaps you on the fanny and says 'Go Man.'  That's the whole action, trying  to regain your self respect after a start like that."" (ep:  Don't Count Stars)

""At first I asked myself, 'Where can I go for healing?  Where can I find a tourniquet to stop the bleeding?'  So I told myself, 'Let grief ride outside on a motorcycle of its own.  Let it try and catch me.  Let it cast shadows of its own.  You know Dr Bell, I left a trail of buried albatross from coast to coast.' 'How much is a pound albatross Vicky?' ''Nobody can afford it.  So everyday I grew lighter, and greedier for life.' (ep:  How Much is a Pound of Albatross?)

""Whoever fights the future has a mortal enemy, a faceless enemy.  Because the future has no being of its own. It steals its being from each man, and once it has tricked him of his secrets, it appears outside him: a predator he must meet; but it can be met, and it can be vanquished, if only you'll reach out for it with open arms, and a hungry heart."" (ep:  Go Read the River)

""Whenever you reach an impasse, look at the third side of the coin. ... The third side is the edge, the place the two sides come together, the meeting place of heads and tails. Dad used to say that was the best side because it welds opposites together, and it's a circle, a continuing circle closed and perfect, as endless as understanding itself."" (ep:  Three Faces)

I think these five quotes offer a flavor of the spirit of this humanitarian show.  Love is also a major theme throughout the series:
.'
People don't fall in love anymore.  They form a mutually compulsive complementary interrelationship of egos.

I don't want to end up doing the same thing to you that, that he did to me - bringing along a past that no future could ever overcome.

To refuse love is the same as turning one's back on life.

At the party, everywhere I looked I saw masks, masks on everybody, and in their mannered poses, I saw my own self deceit. ... Don't you think I want to find someone for whom I can say 'I love you '.

A quote on lies and one on truth:

Lies always have a certain weight for those who wish to believe them.

The truth is always coming back at me from a time that doesn't exist anymore.

The series also introduces the viewer to critical thinking and logical fallacies when it talks about parataxic distortion.  The episode Trap at Cordova offers encouragement for school teachers.  The defense mechanism of projection is very clearly presented in the episode Shadow of an Afternoon.  Another episode covers splitting. The episode Narcissus on a Red Fire Engine discusses the myth of Narcissus and the pain of not being able to love and be loved.  Many of the episodes feature guest stars from the Who's Who of Hollywood from that time.

Two other tv series that were made back then, that I also liked a lot, are The Fugitive and The Naked City.

5063126,3,B0077T5SWC,"I bought this series because I kept reading that the writer-producer of the series (Stirling Silliphant) was exceptional...and he was. Many of the individual episodes are very interesting and novel for a television series. Also many of the directors went on to great careers (Sam Peckinpah,  Arthur Hiller and Robert Altman) and the roster of stars is extraordinary...from youngsters like Robert Duval and Robert Redford to Hollywood legends like Miriam Hopkins, Rod Steiger and Boris Karloff. The inherent weakness of the series was the show's leading actor, Martin Milner. I'm sure he was a fine fellow, but he was an extremely limited actor, the kind you might find plying his trade in a College or a Community Theater. It is genuinely painful at times seeing him so hopelessly overparted with first-rate actresses like Ruth Roman and Vera Miles. George Maharis (his partner) was much better, but Maharis left the series during the 3rd season because of illness and he was replaced by a walking mannequin. All in all, a disappointing investment of time and money. [But I should add that it was almost worth the investment of both to see the legendary Ethel Waters in what must have been one of her final roles!]",1454284800,5,1214,4.950980392156863

5063149,5,B0077T5SWC,"Featuring adult and literate scripts, on-location filming and an incredible roster of actors and actresses in their guest casts, the four seasons of ""Route 66"" just might comprise one of the most impressive and adult entertainments in all of 1960s television. The story of Tod Stiles (Martin Milner) and Buz Murdoch (George Maharis)--and later, Vietnam vet Linc Case (Glenn Corbett)--jumping into a Corvette and basically wandering around America, the show operates as a time machine/road trip examination of the country as it was 50+ years ago. Those wanting to read a superlative article on the subject are advised to seek out Paul Mavis' comments on the DVD Talk website. For myself, having just watched all 116 episodes for the first time, courtesy of the recent Shout Factory box set, I would like to limit myself to commenting on some of my favorite episodes and performances; not an easy selection process, I assure you!
  In his book on ""Route 66,"" author James Rosin lists his top 25 episodes, but I decided that that would be kind of silly for me to do, as that would have represented almost 1/4 of the entire series run. Instead, I have limited myself to a baker's dozen here (it was almost impossible to restrict myself to a Top 10 list). I tried to be completely objective in my choices, and base my picks on the show's artistic merit--its writing, its emotional impact, its entertainment value, its performances--rather than the inclusion of several of my favorite actors and actresses; otherwise, the episodes with Anne Francis, Tuesday Weld, Buster Keaton, Boris Karloff et al. would have automatically been included, irrespective of the show's other qualities. Thus, here are my favorite episodes, based on a single viewing, and with the full knowledge that this list very well might change after later, repeat viewings. The episodes are listed in chronological order:

1) SHEBA--The one with Lee Marvin as the ranch owner. I loved the surprise ending of this one, but the biggest surprise in this episode for me, and one that almost made me fall off my couch, was when Carol Ohmart appeared on screen. Ohmart is an actress who I have long been enamored (and a little scared) of, by dint of her performance in the classic horror film ""House on Haunted Hill."" In the many decades since I first saw the film as a kid, I have only seen her in two other films, ""Spider Baby"" and ""The Scavengers."" It is not exactly easy to see Carol Ohmart in anything, and her appearance here really put this ep over the top for me.
2) AN ABSENCE OF TEARS--I am a big fan of the genre of movies known as film noir, and this episode--the one featuring Martha Hyer as the blind woman who goes after her husband's killers--is just about as close as ""Route 66"" ever got to a genuine film noir.
3) MOST VANQUISHED, MOST VICTORIOUS--The one in which Tod and Buz do a favor for Tod's aunt (Beatrice Straight), and endeavor to find a cousin of his. I have never seen Buz do anything tougher than burn that punk kid's leather jacket in the street, and the fight against the gang at the end was just too cool for words.
4) A SKILL FOR HUNTING--I'm not gonna lie...I have a preference for the ""action episodes"" and the ""horror episodes"" of this series (as opposed to the comedy episodes, or the tearjerkers, or the over-the-top dramas), and this one, with Gene Evans gunning for the boys in the mountains at the end, is one of the best. The finale, with that bear trap, is wonderfully tense stuff.
5) A MONTH OF SUNDAYS--The one with the dying Anne Francis. Putting aside my lifelong love of all things Anne (the woman who jump-started my puberty, by dint of her performance in 1965's ""Honey West,"" and who was kind enough to send me TWO handwritten letters years later, following my request for an autograph), we have a beautiful love story here, wonderfully photographed in Montana, with a killer-diller of an emotional finale. Perhaps my very favorite episode of the 116.
6) THE THIN WHITE LINE--Tod takes some kind of psycho-inducing drug and goes bonkers all over Philadelphia. I love this episode for Milner's remarkable performance, for Al Lewis' priceless reaction shots, and for that incredible ending on the bridge. We know that Tod will not kill himself here (not with 2 1/2 seasons to go!) but such is the power of this ep that the viewer is worried about his fate anyway. Similar to the drug that Tod unwittingly ingests, this episode itself is very strong stuff. To quote Tod: ""Deee-licious!""
7) TO WALK WITH THE SERPENT--I was amazed at how timely this episode was, depicting a group of terrorists who plot to blow up a bomb in the crowded streets of Boston, 50 years before the terrible actuality. The scene in which the FBI agent (Simon Oakland) shows Tod and Buz the film of the group's meeting is absolutely chilling, as well reflected on the boys' shocked faces.
8) AREN'T YOU SURPRISED TO SEE ME?--The one in which the religious nut (David Wayne) kidnaps Buz and threatens to kill him, unless the world straightens up and starts obeying the 10 Commandments. Tense, suspenseful, and capped by one remarkable speech from Buz at the end.
9) EVEN STONES HAVE EYES--One of Maharis' favorite episodes, and one of mine, too. A nicely believable reaction to his blindness from Buz, a realistic feeling of helplessness from Tod, a sweet romance between Buz and the Barbara Barrie character, a sad yet honest ending, all add up to a genuine winner.
10) THERE I AM...THERE I ALWAYS AM--The one in which playgirl Joanne Moore is caught in the rocks with the tide coming in, and Buz attempts to get her out. It was about this time that I realized that on this show, anything COULD happen to any character. Maybe Joanna Moore WILL drown in this episode. She would naturally be saved on any other program, but perhaps not on THIS one! Another tense and suspenseful episode, with beautiful scenery and the pleasing sight of George Maharis doing a LOT of physically demanding running around.
11) BETWEEN HELLO AND GOODBYE--I love the ""horror episodes"" of ""Route 66,"" as I have said, and this one surely qualifies, with gorgeous Susan Oliver, here in her second of three appearances in the series, playing ""twin sisters."" A surprise ending (that I actually saw coming from the get-go) and a fantastic double performance from Susan really put this one over for me. (By the way, the new documentary on Susan Oliver, ""The Green Girl,"" is just terrific, and can be purchased at thegreengirlmovie.com.)
12) WELCOME TO THE WEDDING--Buz had been kidnapped in ""Aren't You Surprised to See Me?,"" and in this ep, it was Tod's turn to be taken by a psycho bad guy; namely, Rod Steiger, here contributing one of the most intense performances of all the 116 episodes.
13) IN THE CLOSING OF A TRUNK--Another terrific horror episode, with Ruth Roman as the woman who had killed her father with a fishing tool and is now feeling a bit edgy again. There is one scene in this episode that is just striking. Ruth looks out of a window and sees a couple strolling on the beach. The shot is filmed from behind her head, and the look of the image is like something out of a European art film; almost as if Ingmar Bergman were shooting the scene on Faro Island or something. This one shot is like nothing that was being done on television at the time. It really surprised me.

As for my favorite performances, choosing my favorite 13 episodes out of the 116 was hard enough, but since each of those eps contained at least one or two noteworthy performances, and some of them three or four, you can see that I had a LOT to consider here. Thus, I decided to simplify matters for myself a bit, and eliminate from consideration any performances that had featured in my favorite episodes. This seemed like common sense, almost, as the reason that many of those episodes were my favorites to begin with was largely due to the performances therein, and I do not wish to repeat myself here. But this also meant eliminating such powerful performances as that of Martha Hyer in ""An Absence of Tears,"" Gene Evans in ""A Skill for Hunting,"" Anne Francis in ""A Month of Sundays,"" Al Lewis in ""The Thin White Line,"" Dan O'Herlihy in ""To Walk With the Serpent,"" David Wayne in ""Aren't You Surprised to See Me?,"" Barbara Barrie in ""Even Stones Have Eyes,"" Susan Oliver in ""Between Hello and Goodbye,"" Rod Steiger in ""Welcome to the Wedding"" (an amazingly focused and intense performance) and Ruth Roman in ""In the Closing of a Trunk."" Still, there were hundreds of remarkable acting jobs left to consider; indeed, I don't believe a single episode of ""Route 66"" EVER featured a lousy performance from anyone, a testament to the directors and actors who worked on the show. After some thought, I have come up with a list, not of the best performances--I despair of ever doing that--but of some of my favorite standout performances; a baker's dozen that perforce could not include such amazing work by luminaries such as Michael Rennie, Sylvia Sidney, Walter Matthau, Darren McGavin, Ethel Waters, Inger Stevens, Pat Hingle, Albert Salmi, Steven Hill, David Janssen, Luther Adler, Sorrell Booke, (yummy) Madlyn Rhue, Joanne Linville, Richard Basehart, (scrumptious) Diane Baker, Dick York, Rip Torn, Miriam Hopkins, William Shatner, Jo van Fleet and Michael Parks. Has any show in TV history boasted such incredible guest casts? Anyway, as to my highly personal picks, which of course might change the next time I take this road trip, here they are, again presented in chronological order:

1) DAN DURYEA as Mike McKay, in ""Don't Count Stars""--Really, I could just as easily have chosen Duryea's performance in ""A Cage In Search of a Bird,"" but found this one to be a bit more highly emotionally charged. His work here as the alcoholic uncle--in actuality, the father--of a young girl was just tremendous, and his scene with Maharis toward the end one of great emotional weight. No surprise here, really; Duryea has long been one of my favorite character actors from the `40s and onward, whose presence always improved any film that he appeared in.
2) SUSAN OLIVER as Joan Maslow, in ""Welcome to Amity""--Not perhaps as impressive as her double performance in ""Between Hello and Goodbye,"" but really, some very fine work, still, playing the steely and determined young woman who comes back to her hometown to move her pariah mother's burial plot.
3) NEHEMIAH PERSOFF as Dvorovoi, in ""Incident on a Bridge""--This pitiful character, an almost deformed Neanderthal brute, turns quite touching by the episode's end, when he offers money to the Lois Smith character so that she might be able to go to speech school. Persoff makes the brute almost akin to a Quasimodo, and the viewer actually believes that pretty Smith would want to run away with him. I was tempted to give the nod to Persoff's performance in the later episode ""First Class Mouliak,"" but found this one even more affecting.
4) ROBERT DUVALL as Arnie, in ""Birdcage on My Foot""--Not since Frank Sinatra's turn in ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" had we been presented with such a grueling depiction of a junkie going through withdrawal, and Duvall is frighteningly convincing here, especially in his wonderful scene with Maharis toward the end. Very powerful stuff!
5) JULIE NEWMAR as Vicki Russell, in both ""How Much a Pound Is Albatross?"" AND ""Give an Old Cat a Tender Mouse""--The only character to be brought back for a sequel in ""Route 66,"" and for good reason. Newmar is simply wonderful as the personification of the ""free spirit,"" and indeed, I can't decide which episode she is more touching in.
6) TUESDAY WELD as Miriam Moore, in ""Love Is a Skinny Kid""--First seen wearing a fright mask as she enters her hometown in Texas, Tuesday soon reveals herself for the broken beauty that she is. Weld, at this point in time, was not generally regarded as a quality actress, despite her excellent work on the ""Dobie Gillis"" show as Thalia Menninger, but her fans knew that she was much more than a (remarkably) pretty face, and that would be proved later in the `60s and `70s, when she demonstrated what a fine dramatic actress she could be. Her work in this episode is assuredly evidence of her early promise.
7) NINA FOCH as Autumn, in ""Across Walnuts and Wine""--I was torn between giving her the nod for her work here or in the earlier episode, ""A Bridge Across Five Days."" In that earlier ep, she was extremely moving as a woman trying to adjust to life after being released from a mental hospital. Here, though, I think she is even more devastating, playing a lonely schoolteacher returning to her sister's home in Oregon. Her speech at the end is very touching; almost an ode to loneliness. Brilliant work.
8) VERA MILES as Ellen Barnes, in ""Where Is Chick Lorimer? Where Has She Gone?""--Another damaged woman who returns to her old hometown, but here, we have an ex-stripper who is trying to cover up her past. Miles brings both pathos and grit to the character, who turns out to be more of a free spirit than even Tod Stiles!
9) LOIS NETTLETON as Isabel (and a bunch of other names!), in ""Suppose I Said I Was the Queen of Spain""--Her character in this episode, who steals $9K using Tod's credit card, is surely not one to engender the viewer's sympathy, and yet, by the episode's end, which features a remarkable and lengthy speech from the woman, that sympathy is somehow attained. Tod applauds this speech, and, for different reasons, so did I!
10) J. CARROLL NAISH as Mike Donato, in ""And Make Thunder His Tribute""--Naish had previously impressed me dozens of times via his character work in God knows how many films of the `30s and onward; he is one of the finest character actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood, usually known for playing villains. Thus, how nice to see him here playing a decent but old-fashioned Minnesota raspberry farmer, who is at odds with his modern-era son! Naish gives a colorful and moving performance, especially when he lays on what must be assumed to be his deathbed at the end.
11) PARKER FENNELLY as Arthur Perham, in ""I Wouldn't Start From Here""--I have no idea who this Parker Fennelly is; I don't think I have ever seen him in anything before, in film or on television. Still, what a wonderful, naturalistic performance he gives here as the hard-put Vermont farmer trying to hold on to his ancestral land. He makes acting look simple and natural, the way it ought to appear.
12) GEOFFREY HORNE as Simon Devereaux, in ""Is it True There Are Poxies at the Bottom of Landfair Lake?""--Playing a returned vet in Savannah, Horne gives us a very unlikable character;a troublemaker and borderline nut case. Ultimately, though, in one of the longest speeches in all of ""Route 66""--one that gets more and more dramatic until the screen fairly explodes--his character reveals why he is the way he is, and it is a fairly shocking moment. Surely, one of the most over-the-top performances of this series' four seasons.
13) LOIS SMITH as Lucy Brown, in ""Who In His Right Mind Needs a Nice Girl?""--Smith's fourth appearance on ""Route 66,"" and my favorite. She had been pretty brilliant in the episode ""Only By Cunning Glimpses,"" playing a spooky clairvoyant, but here gives us a character who, like Nina Foch's, was almost heartbreaking in her loneliness and misery. Her decision to give a conning murderer her life savings on the off chance of happiness is just pitiful, and Smith plays the part wonderfully.

  Anyway, those are my 13 cents' worth of thoughts on great ""Route 66"" performances. Oh, crap...I didn't even mention Joan Crawford, or Boris Karloff, or Buster Keaton, or Joe E. Brown....",1431993600,15,15634,4.755801104972376

Wish it would have contained comentary tracks and more features, but just having this landmark series finally available as a complete boxed set in any form is great. Sterling Silliphant's poetic scripts and the ""all-location"" production technique puts this show in a class by itself.

a preposterously nonsensical sequence of overly dramatic situations that could never have
occurred to a couple of drifters (or anyone else)  in any era. Aside from the impossibiity of
their occurrance, the events tended to be preachy and endowed what many would view as
dull-witted souls with wisdom possessed by no one, at least not of this world. It's too
bad Silliphant had such a confounded view of life- this could have been a really great series
if he had adhered to its basic attraction - free spirits travelling the highways in a great car,
instead of attempting to perfect what he saw as a very imperfect human nature, ending up
with a sort of non-ecumenical morality play. So Silliphant gets real old, real fast. And Martin
Milner was completely miscast - Adam 12 was his proper balliwick. Glenn Corbett should
have been Maharis' counterweight.  What a shame.",1390003200,2,968,4.896341463414634

5063185,5,B0077T5SWC,"EDIT 12/28/2013: After receiving this set for Christmas this year I can see that the quality of the product in my opinion is far superior then anything I've seen yet. Below is my original review it's entirety. I've changed my original 2 star to 5 star. Trust me from one who has had complete sets first in VHS, then bootlegged DVD and now this.

First I want to say this. My 2 stars is only for my disappointment. 5 stars for the series itself.

I'm a child of the 50-60's but only became a loving fan when the show was on Nick at Night. I made my first purchase of a VHS (Columbia House) tape set off of eBay after many off and on searches. I made my purchase again of another set when they were available in DVD. As it turned out they were bootlegged off the VHS's I had.

I'll always remember after I won that VHS auction set, from out of the blue I received an email not 10 minutes later from one of the other bidders. He stated that as a boy he lived in El Paso TX at the time when an episode was shot there. He had no idea what the name of the episode was. There was a very good friend of his family who had managed to to get a bit part in it with his horse. He even had a few lines. All he could remember was that it had Lee Marvin in it and that there was one scene in a cow corral. He asked that if the set contained that particular episode then to please make him a copy. He wanted that just as a memento to his good friend since his friend had past. That episode was in the set ""Sheba"" and even though he said he would happy to pay for the cost of a copy, I would hear none of that and I was more then happy to oblige him. After he received it he wrote me back again thanking me, saying how nice it was to get one last glimpse of his friend and seeing parts of El Paso from his youth as he remembers it.

The DVD set that I do have does have some pretty raunchy episodes in quality. Many episodes have a darkish green tint to them. Recently I was at a big name, big box outlet and noticed this box set was available. I was about to pull the trigger and buy it a 3rd time but I'm glad I waited till read these reviews. I would love to see this series re-mastered by someone who actually loves the series. I feel it deserves no less. But sadly I guess that's not to be. However, I want to say this...I can't put into words how much I admire and love this series. The concept, the writing and the production values. Seeing all of the would be future stars etc... All of it.

Yes, I know the later episodes story lines seemed to be a little lost but it still beats the fair that's put out today. The one single thing I always loved about this series is that in every episode there seemed to have a little jewel of dialog (usually coming out of Buzz's mouth)that I could put in my pocket and keep. I guess what I want to say is that IF you don't already have the series and have never seen it, THEN BUY THIS AND ENJOY IT for what it is! It's storytelling at its very, very best",1387324800,8,2983,3.956738768718802

decay of American values today.  You can see the moral decay beginning in a few of the episodes and our society is like garbage now
compared to the 60's.  The views of towns visited are great and the guest stars make this one of my favorite Amazon purchases.

I remember watching this series when it was on in the early sixties and have really enjoyed seeing the episodes once again.  Three of my favorite episodes are ""The Thin White Line"" and the ""Cruelest Sea of All"" featuring Martin Milner also ""Even Stones Have Eyes"" featuring George Maharis, from the second & third seasons.  I especially liked Martin Milner's noteworthy performance in ""The Thin White Line"" in which he as Tod Stiles, without knowing, consumes a drug-laced glass of beer. He shows an enormous acting range and should have been nominated for an Emmy Award.  Most of the story lines are very good and feature many well known actors who were just starting out. It's a shame that George Maharis came down ill and had to leave the series in it's third season. I enjoyed the Milner-Maharis chemisry.",1379721600,4,984,4.670520231213873

Of coures; don't want to spend much time on why I feel this way ; since if you are going to purchase the set ; you already know how great Route 66 is.  I plan on watching 1 episode each week; just like as it was broadcast on CBS; except no commercials. The first 3 episodes have no lose in quality at all.

I can't understand the bad comments on picture ratio, Grainy, bad sound...Of course as the weeks go by with later episodes the original production quality certinly will appear better and better.  I am so releived to see how great the quality of the first three episodes are; after seeing so many negative comments. I hopes this clears up any confusion the potential purchasers may have...I purchase the set Mid August 2103..

5063192,5,B0077T5SWC,"I grew up watching some episodes of Route 66 during its' initial run, but mostly in reruns. The tale of two young men traveled across America in a Corvette is the stuff of legend. This classic American anthology series initially starred Martin Milner and George Maharis and later Glenn Corbett. A Kerouac inspired on the road style series, the guest stars over the years were enormous: Joan Crawford, Tuesday Weld, Robert Redford, Rod Steiger, Julie Newmar, William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, Robert Duvall, Burt Reynolds,  Walter Matthau, Lee Marvin and so many more, Best of all for me was seeing Kent McCord, who would later co-star with Milner in Adam 12. The quality of the transfers are average and the pilot episode is almost too dark to watch. But this appears to be the only way to watch this unless you plan on catching reruns on MeTV",1377907200,2,843,4.773972602739726
5063193,4,B0077T5SWC,"My wide and I spent the last six months watching each of the 116 episodes in the Route 66 arc. There are compelling stories. There are funny stories. There are silly stories. There are stories that are just plain bad. However, each of the 116 stories in this set dishes up a small slice of what some piece of America (or Canada in one episode) was like during the early 1960s. There's lots of music, mostly jazz. There's racial segregation, xenophobia, drug addiction, gnawing loneliness, dysfunctional families, juvenile delinquency, fear of nuclear attack. There are also unlikely stories of love, of loss, and of adventure. There are lots of fistfights. An amazing number of fistfights--almost in every episode. A sign of the times?

The series is best in the first three seasons when George Maharis plays Buz. Maharis is an actor who stepped onto the ""Route 66"" set the very first day just oozing with visible acting ability. Martin Milner grew into his role as Tod by the fourth season. Glenn Corbett came to the series very late as Linc and his role as a burned-out Vietnam vet was not written very well until the end. He has a lot of scenes where his profile is featured in the camera. He doesn't speak. He doesn't flinch. He doesn't blink. He's stiff as a board. Perhaps there's deep meaning there but as TV, it's boring. As the writers discovered what Corbett could do, they wrote better material for him. Much better. Unfortunately, it's only better for Corbett in the last few episodes of the series.

However, it's not really the stories or the acting that kept us watching ""Route 66"" through all 116 episodes. It was that look through 116 lenses at the state of the union way, way back in the 1960s when we'd ""just won the war,"" when American manufacturing prowess was unchallenged, and when the boomers were just coming into their own. Cities that showed up frequently included Cleveland, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis (?). Florida gets its unfair share of exposure, especially in season 4. We really enjoyed seeing these bits and pieces of Americana that we're both old enough to remember. That's what kept us coming back for more.

5063194,4,B0077T5SWC,"There seems to be a great deal of controversy over the quality of these film prints, several of which are clearly described as the ""best available materials."" As far as I'm concerned, there are so many astonishingly great episodes to relish in this set, the handful of slightly less than stellar prints is of little consequence. I absolutely will not buy TV show collections that have music replaced (i.e., Northern Exposure or WKRP in Cinncinnati), but no such problem exists here. If you refuse to buy this set because it isn't perfect, you will be depriving yourself of some of the best scripts and performances of the early 1960s. The guest stars alone represent a virtual ""who's who"" of top talent from the period. I especially loved seeing Elizabeth Seal (who was starring in Irma La Douce on Broadway and earning herself a Tony for Best Actress) in a heartbreakingly dramatic performance as a theatrical has-been trying to make a comeback in the chorus of a TV variety show.

5063200,5,B0077T5SWC,"Follow Todd and Buzz on their manifold adventures through late-Eisenhower/early JFK America, in glorious b&w.  Each episode is separate and distinct.  Watch Robert Duvall steal an episode as a heroin addict and blow the socks off Maharis and Martin Milner with his acting.  Watch Rod Steiger play a creepy gangster.  The best part of the series: The contrast between the two acting styles of the main characters: Maharis is the East coast Method Actor; Martin Milner is the West coast USC-trained actor.  A favorite is when Todd and Buzz become school teachers in a small New Mexico town.  See Susan Oliver play a platinum blond Polish woman who wants to bury her dead alcoholic mother in a ""proper"" cemetery.  See Tuesday Weld wearing a weird mask as she re-visits her childhood Texas home and ignites a fight between Buzz Murdoch (our anti-hero) and a young Burt Reynolds.  Most of the episodes are ""good"" to ""excellent.""  But there are a few ""dogs"" in the mix.  Boring: Buster Keaton episode; episode with Texas woman wanting to become a nun.  The best part of the series is the repartee/chemistry between Maharis and Milner.  They work good off each other.  Rated on one list as one of the top 75 tv shows of all time.  Show yanked--I believe--on Friday November 22, 1963 because of the JFK assassination.  It came on on Fridays at 8:00 or 8:30 pm on CBS, sponsored by Chevrolet.  Right before The Twilight Zone.  See Robert Redford play a Polish man who accidentally kills his girlfriend in Cleveland.  See Keir Dullea help save Buzz and Todd before they're lynched by creepy, southern bigots.  A lot of fisticuffs and fighting and bare knuckle brawling between both Buzz and Todd and their various adversaries--including a near psychotic David Janssen, as a near-demented fisherman.  You also get to see TV actors and actresses who appeared on Route 66, but who later snagged starring roles on TV shows later in the decade: Ed Asner, Suzanne Pleschette, Marion Ross, etc.  A strange but good episode is when Buzz goes temporarily blind and falls in love with Barbara Barrie, who plays a blind woman.  Actress Lois Smiith pops up a few times.  So does Lee Marvin.  The late Inger Stevens visits a chicken farm in Boiling Springs, PA only to encounter an ogerish Pat Hingle. White ""Tea Party"" conservatives with an ultra-right wing agenda nearly blow up the public square in Boston  (this episode is remarkably prescient).  This series is so unique that I highly recommend it to anyone interested in early TV.",1371254400,4,2513,4.84037558685446
5063201,5,B0077T5SWC,"Sure, the plots are corny, the dialogue of bit staged, but since all of these episodes were filmed on location, if one pays attention to the backgrounds, a true American historian can get a view of the past, albeit a black and white past.  One item that is included in this set is a panel discussion with George Maharis, Herb Leonard, et al, that lends some background into the filming of the program.  I actually found this very insightful.  Some of these shows I remember watching as a teenager, others are new to me.  I find the ones that I had seen as a kid the most intrigueing since it proves to me how the mind remembers things and how one perceives things some 45 years later.  I would highly recommend this series for the real ""Route 66"" fans as well as those new to Route 66.  I did an NPR commentary about this show in 2003, so I had more than a casual interest in acquiring this set.  Comments welcomed!!!  Thanks!

I also don't have Season 4 on DVD (except for a poor quality bootleg). To me that justifies getting the full series.

Aside from that, Shout Factory did at least as good a job as Roxbury/Infinity did with handling this series. They did not put any time in to remastering the episodes, and they don't claim to. Now I finally have Season 4, and it is available seperately, for those who don't want to get the full series set. If my Robury/Infinity version of Season 3 was in good shape, I would have bought Season 4 alone, with the rest of people who had collected the bits and pieces put out over the years. Remember Season 1 Vol. 2 - released in artificial widescreen? Yuck. This is the final dollar I will spend on this series, too bad Martin, George and Glenn (RIP) aren't getting any royalites from these DVDs.

As for the show itself. Route 66 will always be one of my top favorites. The writing, acting and cinematography were top notch, and the location shooting always added an element of realness to the story that shooting in a studio could never aproach. The local people were always included as were the industries in the cities and towns that were prevalent at the time, and usually were worked into the story for that episode. That sense of realism and culture will never be duplicated in today's homogenized society with outsourced everything. In a sense this show is a snapshot of America in its glory days before the assasination of President Kennedy (mostly anyway), a tribute to the land of Camelot. That's why I'm giving it five stars. It has not had the representation it deserves, and I can only hope that Shout Factory does a better job than its predesessor. Now, can we get Route 66 on Antenna TV, since my cable company does not get MeTv.",1367884800,6,2046,4.542005420054201

Discs would vibrate in the machine or freeze right in the middle of an episode.  (What I went through trying to get a working set of season 3 was ridiculous.)  Needless to say, when Shout Factory announced that they were putting this out, I had no qualms about parting with the Infinity discs.

Was it worth it?  I'd say yes.  Granted, this set is not without flaws.  There are a few less-than-complete length episodes and the picture quality is less-than-great on a few shows.  But overall, I think Shout Factory did a good job putting this together.",1364169600,12,649,4.582608695652174

5063208,5,B0077T5SWC,"I had been renting the series, but getting a lot of delay in receiving the disks.  When I saw the sale at Amazon for the whole series----well I jumped on it!!  It was my favorite show as a teen and I appreciate the strong dramas presented in this show.  I grew up in Grants Pass, OR and two episodes from the first season were filmed in that area, though the lumber mill and the hop farm used in those episodes no longer exist.

I've seen some comments that complained about the audio and/or video quality in the recordings of the last two seasons. I appreciate the advisements posted at the beginning of some episodes that do state there might be problems but the recordings were made from the best copies available.  I just keep the remote handy to increase volume if needed and know that the materials and equipment used in the 60s were not the easily modified digital recordings now used.  I did recordings and pictures then and they don't even measure up to the digital, but we accept what we have and appreciate it's availability.

I have a few friends who were thrilled when they heard of my purchase so there will be some ""girl nights"" enjoying the shows again.  It's great to see shows that do not have to contain profanity, sex and violence to make them marketable.  These are worth seeing repeatedly due to the excellent photography, fine stories and great acting!

5063214,1,B0077T5SWC,"Route 66 is a great series.  My only complaint is that Shout Factory did very little actual work on this set.  All four seasons had already been put on digital masters by Infinity which had released the first 3 seasons.  SF merely bought these digital copies and made dvds from them.  SF did not run one inch of actual film thru a projector.  They just printed more dvd copies from the Infinity masters which had wild variations in picture quality.

I wouldn't complain if SF had at least made some effort to put out a better product.  It seems to me they could have at least found a better film copy of the first episode, Black November, and transferred it to digital.  That alone would have made their dvd set better than Infinity's.

Shout Factory should not be rewarded for repackaging the Infinity dvds.

I give this show 5 stars because it deserves it. Route 66 was an awesome series with great writing, great camera work and great acting. This Shout Factory release however only deserves 1 star for the rush release with no-remastering whatsoever.

5063234,1,B0077T5SWC,"I really wish that I could give this release a glowing five-star review, extolling the virtues of this remarkable series. The fact of the matter is that Route 66's legacy has passed from the hands of one cheap, lazy, unethical company into the hands of another cheap, lazy, unethical company.

When it was announced several months ago that Shout Factory and that the entire series would be released in one big affordable box set, that news seemed promising. ""YES! Shout Factory has acquired the rights to Route 66! Now it will finally get the treatment it deserves!"" wrote one fan of the series on the Shout discussion forums. The implication we were given, and that SF seemed to encourage, was that Shout Factory was going to redo the series from the beginning, taking the time and care to transfer the highest quality prints available to produce the best possible release for the fans. This optimism turned out to be, to put it mildly, premature.

Now that the set is out, it is clear that absolutely NOTHING was done in terms of improving on the quality of Infinity's product, and that the first three seasons appears to be EXACTLY the same prints used in the original Infinity release of the show, which include the sub-bootleg quality of the early first season that company put out on the market. In regard to this earlier release, Infinity spokesman Kirk Hallum later admitted that the company issued a substandard product in an effort to meet a street date in depraved indifference to the desire and best interest of the show's fans.

So fans had every reason to expect an improvement with Shout's, acquisition of the series, and that was bolstered by regular posts to the forum by the set producer, a man named Brian Ward. Ward regularly posted glowing updates of how he and his staff were working with loving care on the release, using ""the best sources availible"" from ""multiple sources"" and that ""the footage looks good."" A few posters to the forum directly addressed the issue of the poor quality of the Infinity releases, specifically the case of the episode ""A Fury Slinging Flame"" for which a poor-quality print edited for syndication was used. These posters made clear to Mr. Ward that this was a major point of contention with them, and that they did not want a syndicated print used in this new version. Ward assured the forum that ""we are doing everything we can to make sure we have the complete episodes,"" and then vanished from the forum.

Several weeks later, the first editions of this set arrived in the hands of consumers. Eager hands popped discs into DVD players and were horrified to find the exact same shoddy Infinity episodes, including the chopped-up ""Flame"". The Shout Factory forums exploded with outrage. When the news broke on the Route 66 discussion boards, fans began cancelling their pre-orders left and right.

This re-release is particularly egregious when one considers that the episodes for the first three seasons are the same ones that fans who faithfully bought the Infinity sets already own. This means that Shout is now asking consumers to fork over 100 clams for a product that many of them already own three-quarters of, just to get a set of the fourth and final season's episodes. This after strongly giving the impression since acquiring ownership of the show that their box set was going to be a new and improved product.

It turns out that Brian Ward has an EXTENSIVE history of lying to Shout's consumers. concerning various TV show releases, telling them anything they want to hear before a set is released; upon which it is discovered that what he said just ain't so.

On the positive side, the packaging is simply gorgeous, with magnificent artwork and nifty individual color-coded case boxes for each of the four individual seasons. Unfortunately, the product within is uneven, making this just essentially just another bootleg in a pretty box.

Of course I must reiterate that this series, one of the greatest of the 1960s, is a five-star classic and my one-star rating for this fiasco should not be confused with that.",1336003200,415,4080,4.82689556509299
5063235,2,B0077T5SWC,"Having bought the complete series directly from Shout! Factory I've received the full season set and had a chance to sample the seasons.

For those that were hoping for remastering and better quality for the 1st season you will be disappointed. I see little change in the season 1 episodes from the Roxbury set (all episodes are in the correct 1:33 format, however). For those hoping for a complete version of ""A Fury Slinging Flame"", sorry to say it's still the shortened syndication version, which is noted prior to the episode playing. The only upside is that a film copy was used as master rather than the really poor video dub version Roxbury used. The pilot episode, ""Black November"" actually looks a little worse, seems darker and muddier than the one on the Roxbury set. That may be because Roxbury brightened their version to offset the darkness of the master they used.

Regardless, if people were hoping for a better quality set than what had been released by Roxbury it didn't happen.  So, buying this set to get the 4th season is going to likely be seen as a waste of money for those that have previously purchased the 3 seasons from Roxbury.  I quit buying the Roxbury sets after season one because it was such a disaster.  So, for me it wasn't as much of a disappoint as it could have been.  But I'm not impressed especially in light of the fact that better copies of many of the 1st season episodes do exist.

Yes, Martin Milner had limitations as an actor. Yes, the series headed south after George Maharis left it. Yes, some of the episodes are clunkers. (Show me the series without them.) Yes, the set is expensive. These are valid points. As far as the visual and audio elements go, I'm prepared to believe that Shout!, a company that believes in quality, did the best with what was available to them.

On the other hand this series had a lot going for it. It still does. The actors hired as featured and supporting players were exceptionally talented in their time: many deservedly went on to stardom. (Why some others didn't but should have is a mystery for another day.) Because the show was at heart an anthology, with the leads typically setting the table for different slices of life brought to us by guest stars, one can be forgiving of Milner and (later) Glenn Corbett. The guest stars play characters you would recognize from Rod Serling's humanistic scripts for ""The Twilight Zone"": everyday people running headlong into crisis or the own frailties. Nelson Riddle usually managed to compose a different theme for each week's episode, orchestrated by Gil Grau, which was sometimes repetitive but certainly held the episode together as though it were a miniature movie. Riddle's signature theme for the series, played over all the end titles, needs no apology whatever: it remains a '60s classic, jazzy emblem of that sleek Corvette skimming the road with the top down, headed who-knows-where-but-there'll-be-something-surprising-when-we-get-there. The scripts, especially those by series co-creator Sterling Silliphant and story editor Howard Rodman, were well paced, articulate, unusually poetic, and utterly distinctive. No series' dialogue in its era sounded like what you heard on ""Route 66."" (Consider episode titles like ""Play It Glissando,"" ""How Much a Pound Is Albatross?"" ""Hell is Empty, All the Devils Are Here."") There's a visual reality to the series, resembling ""Naked City,"" the contemporary sister series by the same producer, Herbert B. Leonard: we were shown the unglamorous day-labor jobs that supported the protagonists until they could afford to move on. Perhaps the most absorbing and still enduring quality of the series is that all the exteriors were shot, not on a studio backlot in L.A., but on actual locations where the main characters, Todd and Buzz, visited: Maine, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and more. This had to have been an expensive production nightmare: to haul all that equipment, crew, and actors, every week, to God-knows-where. It makes of the show a mobile time-capsule of what America, from coast to coast, looked and sounded like almost 60 years agoand it is fascinating.",1506729600,6,3193,5.068441064638783
