1503969,4,B00005JM23,"I can see why Spun is getting comparisons to Requiem for a Dream.  Both are drug movie with unapologetic drug abuse rampant throughout.  Both deal with both the perspective of the users while influenced as well as the gritty viscereal physical problems that the lifestyle brings.
Where they depart is in both respect for their characters (there's ALOT more going on with the characters in Spun than there was in Requiem)and the depth of the story.
In Spun, we meet Spider Mike (Leguizamo), his uglied-up girlfriend (Mena Suvari), his customers (Schwarzman), the Cook who makes the dope (Rourke in an amazing part, guy was scary as hell) and his sweetheart tweaking girlfriend (Murphy.)  All of them have seperate and distinct stories.
This was a good movie. My wife actually made the decision to go to sleep because she said she was mad at the characters for their lifestyle.  That's how much you get into their world.
I only gave this 4 stars because it is a difficult movie to watch, but it is worthwhile.  I won't watch it again anytime soon (possibly ever) but I'm glad I got to see it.",1059436800,2,1090,4.68586387434555
1503970,5,B00005JM23,"SEE THIS MOVIE. IF YOU APPRECIATE GREAT FILMMAKING, GREAT ACTING AND INCREDIBLE ART DIRECTION THIS FILM IS A MUST SEE. THE ENSEMBLE CAST DOES SOME OF THE BEST WORK OF THEIR CAREERS. ESPECIALLY MICKEY ROURKE.
AND WHY OH WHY IS THE SOUNDTRACK NOT AVAILABLE? THE MUSIC IN THIS FILM IS ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!",1059350400,,305,4.884615384615385
1503971,5,B00005JM23,"Requiem is good, GO is good, PulpFiction also is good, but I think this one is the best.  The acting is funny and true-life.  Alot of drug movies try be too serious, when this movie looks at the silly aspect of it, just people getting messed up.  For weirdness, I think this movies has Happiness beat also.",1059350400,,306,4.333333333333333
1503972,3,B00005JM23,"Spun is a frenetic, sometimes harrowing, sometimes funny and sometimes over-stylized account of speed freaks. The characters is this film --Ross (Jason Schwartzman), Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), Cookie (Mena Suvari), Nikki (Brittany Murphy) and the leader of this legion of lost souls, The Cook (Mickey Rourke) don't merely use meth, they live and breathe it night and day. Director Jonas Akerlund uses all kinds of visual tricks to emphasize the state of mind this induces --speeding up the action, animated hallucinations and a close-up of an eyeball as the drug rushes to the brain (or what's left of it). Several critics have complained that the style was taken from Requiem For A Dream; perhaps, but the overall mood of the two films is quite different (Requiem is much darker). In some ways Spun reminded me of Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas (a better  and more original film in my view) --both follow the antics of people who are perpetually in a drugged-out state. Spun does a good job conveying the alternate universe of these addicts. They are always wired, on the verge of paranoia and desperate for their next fix. The drug has complete dominion over their lives. Of course, this is not the first film to portray addiction and watching the aimless, mindless and self-destructive behavior of such characters can get tiresome. What makes Spun watchable and interesting are some good performances, especially by Schwartzmann, Rourke and Leguizamo. There are a pair of cops on their trail, who are also meth freaks. While the characters' lives are pathetic and absurd, the film sometimes overemphasizes this a little, as when Ross chains a woman to his bed and forgets about her for days. Although Spun hardly seems like a movie with a message, it does a better job than any TV movie- of-the-week or moralistic anti-drug commercial in portraying the dangers of prolonged drug use.",1059264000,,1889,4.977848101265823
1503973,1,B00005JM23,"Why would anyone want to see a movie that is a horrible imitation of ""Requiem for a dream""? ( In case you didn't see that movie,it was an anti-drug movie with quality starring Academy Award Winner Jennifer Connelly,Ellen Burstyn & Jared Leto & was so much more than this crap ! )This movie is supposed to be unusual but the only thing unusual about it is the punishment one gets from experiencing it ! It's cast is 100% wasted. They keep showing a gagged naked woman struggling to get out as she's handcuffed to a bed against her will with her eyes & mouth covered with silver electrical tape while the 'boyfriend' goes out with another girl to get drugs over & over while she may be laying there dying in the motel room. Everyone is filthy in this- for example: Mena Suvari ( the beauty of ""American Beauty"" movie )has brown teeth,the main character has grease for hair,Brittany Murphy's dressed like a low-paid hooker,Patrick Fugit ( star of ""Almost Famous"" ) has more pimples on his face than a pepperoni pizza & eats food that appears to be actual crap as his 500 lb. mother asks for food & he ignores her,Mickey Rourke looks like he's been on hard drugs in real life for a long,long time, Eric Roberts plays a gay Elvis Presley impersonator & he looks like his sister: Julia Roberts ! in his 2 minute role in this ! & worst of all they have a scraggly dyed green dog they overdose on drugs ! I am 100% no feminist or animal rights activist but this movie was completely disgusting ! It didn't even try to hide that it was using the same special camera angles,special sound effects to show drug use as was done in ""Requiem for a Dream"". However prepared for a drug movie one is- this is no druggies movie- this is just a sorry celluoid reason to avoid buying movies without renting first ! It is obviously made by someone who hates women & animals & loves drugs. ""Spun"" is lacking of any meaning whatsoever. If you want to see a despicable depiction of drug snorting women-haters who kill their pets with the fumes of the drugs they're making-watch this 100 minutes of excrement. Whatever it was trying to be- it was an upsetting terrible waste of time. ""Spun"" makes one wonder ""How low can Hollywood sink ?!"" At this point,one learns to RENT movies instead of buying to avoid getting stuck with garbage like this trash.",1059091200,8,2324,4.470588235294118
1503974,5,B00005JM23,"it was a great film, showing how it really is and how bad it is and how fun it is, all at the same time. best ""drug"" film i've seen in years. if you liked this one check out The Salton Sea. it's about tweekers too, but a bit more on the serious side. anyway, spun is a damn fine film and should be watched by anyone who knows a tweeker and can laugh at how true to life it is.",1059091200,3,376,3.654320987654321
1503975,3,B00005JM23,"Spun is an attempt to be like Requiem For A Dream but just came up short.  The characters aren't very interesting and the whole movie just kind of wanders.  I suggest passing this movie up and seeing Requiem For A Dream instead.  Requiem/Dream has a much better and interesting cast including Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans.  Plus, the score for Requiem/Dream is way more intense.  I give Spun only 3 stars for being just ""okay.""",1059091200,,462,4.7974683544303796

1504462,4,B00005JM23,"This film was recommended to me by an ex-meth cooker. He said it showed what meth was like. I did  not find any humor in the girl handcuffed to the bed running gag, so for that I don't give it five stars. Neither was I quite so interested in the girl problems of the young star. But overall the movie was very entertaining and amusing and I would like to see it again. (Only sorry I rented it instead of buying a used copy.) Another quibble, I don't know, but it seemed to me the Eric Roberts character, show stealer that he was, was some kind of false flag as to who is ""Mr. Big"" in the world of organized meth production, which I had read had to do with huge ""hidden"" laboratories, the Mexican mafia, and bikers and illegal alien factory workers. (See Methland book.) But, as entertainment, a good movie.",1474416000,,806,4.302631578947368

1504967,2,B00005JM23,"This is a movie about meth and the people who use it.  It seems pretty accurate; people on meth do act that way.  It stars Brittany Murphy as a stripper meth addict and Mickey Rourke in a relatively small role as her boyfriend the ""cook"" who manufacturers it.  There's not really much of a story.  You never really care much about the characters.  On the positive side, it doesn't make you want to try the drug.  It also does not make you want to rewatch the movie.  It's a mediocre movie, worth watching if you like drug movies I guess, probably not if you're like most people.  This is one DVD your collection can do without.",1431388800,,627,4.344827586206897

The first friend I made when I moved into my current town moved themselves while I was in middle school, and another family had moved in for a few years.  During that whole time the father managed to turn the basement into a meth lab, and the house had to be condemned before it could go back on the market.

The accuracy of how this movie depicts what it is like when meth addiction rules your world or cooking meth pays your bills is just as palpable today, Very underrated movie considering how so many people have creamed their jeans over ""Breaking Bad"", waxing poetic about the performances and gushing about it around the water cooler every week at work.  Some people must live in a bubble when it comes to hardcore drug use because that's the only explanation I can come up with on why  it ever became so popular to gush about a TV show that centers around a drug that is more addictive and harder to kick than heroin.

THIS movie gives you the best possible view of what it would be like if your brain is on meth and what it looks like to be on a binge that lasts for days.  It's UGLY, from beginning to end.  There is no plot to this movie, there is no fairy tale ending because there is no rhyme or reason or excuses for addiction.  Addiction is either in your life or it isn't, whether your the addict, an enabler, a family member, friend or significant other who had to cut you out of their life, a person who works for child protective services, an ER doctor or nurse, etc.

The difference between when this movie came out and now, is that addiction is a part of mainstream culture.",1415318400,11,1612,4.325581395348837

1505188,4,B00005JM23,"First of all, be sure you buy the UNRATED cut of the film.  The R rated version is censored and ridiculous.  This is one of the instant classics of trash cinema.  Its a fantastic movie and at times flirts with conveying an anti drug message (really its implicit because you don't want to be one of these people), but really the film isn't interested in judging the characters or meth.  It presents the trash culture surrounding the modern junkie culture, especially as its exists around the lower class where it perhaps festers the most, and sort of lets it stand on its own.  The crazy and cartoonish scenes are maybe embellished but in a sense gets the junkie experience more dead on than almost any other film Ive seen (this movie and Drugstore Cowboy would be great companion pieces).  Ive never tried meth and Ive never knowingly been around people who are hooked on it or make it.  But Ive been around people addicted to oxycotin.  Again, it wasn't quite as far out as whats in this film, but the film isn't all that heightened from what I saw.  Especially the undercurrent of nihilistic homelessness that permeates.  The film gets a little too nuts for me with the cops portion.  However, drug police do tend to be a little like those guys, haha.  Again, my experience is limited.  I got pulled over because of a friend of mine and the drug police were grilling me about my street name and pointing at my shirt saying something fell out of my nose (in hopes I would melt and confess to snorting? I guess) and were all like tell us whats up, man.""  I won't lie, I was scared, haha.  But they were talking to the wrong guy. I wouldnt let them search me or my car because screw them.  In the end they wouldnt let me go until I confessed to a bogus story about having smoked weed and not being sure if I had some ashes in my car and that being why I wouldnt allow a search.  Wasnt true at all -- Ive never smoked because I have asthma.  I was clean.  Reluctantly I agreed to that story out of fear theyd charge me (I didn't know it was illegal to leave an expired license in my wallet and the guy saw it when I showed them my current one and I hear felony!"") and they did let me go.  They were after meth and oxy people.  Anyway, the police have struck me as a little ridiculous since then.",1412467200,,2293,4.286046511627907

Regarding the movie, actors: Jason Schwartzman, Brittany Murphy, John Leguizamo and Mena Suvari.

""Spun is a 2003 American crime comedy-drama dark-comedy directed by Jonas kerlund from an original screenplay by William De Los Santos,based on 3 days of his life in the Eugene, Oregon drug subculture and stars Jason Schwartzman, Brittany Murphy, Mickey Rourke, Mena Suvari, John Leguizamo, Patrick Fugit, Eric Roberts, Chloe Hunter and Debbie Harry. It is kerlund's dbut as a feature-film director, having already become known for his work in music videos. The film was shot in 22 days, and centers on various people involved in a methamphetamine drug ring. The film blends elements of dark comedy and drama in its storytelling. Its title is a reference to the slang term for the way users feel after going multiple days without sleep while on a methamphetamine binge.""

I think this is probably a good description of how people get when they're high on speed and keep it going for a few days & I don't think it glamorized meth like other drug movies might do so hopefully this movie might deter some people who may have the wrong idea about uppers. The movie shows how time is totally wasted & these people think they are acting normal even though it's obvious they're pretty far gone. Obviously I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who gets offended at movies that show unethical behavior, drug use, a lot of nudity, & sex because that's all this movie is!

The plotless film follows a bunch of meth heads as they snort drugs and act stupid. That is really the entire film. 90 minutes of the filmmaker showing us what we could already guess; that people who do meth are not only dumb, but become increasingly ugly and unbearable to be around.

1505549,4,B00005JM23,"""Spun"" is a great portrayal of what life can be like while consuming massive amounts of methamphetamine.  The movie takes place in several grungy and grimy sets, mainly people's homes.  The movie not only glorifies the fun aspects of speed, but it also shows the downside (which most addicts will tell you there are plenty of).  The main character, Ross, is an addict getting progressively worse off on the drugs by meeting and driving around a ""cook"", played masterfully by Mickey Rourke.  The film is stylishly directed, the acting is good, and the story is the closest representation to meth life I've ever seen, despite the fact that the entire story is fictional and comic fantasy. ""Spun"" also features awesome new music by Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan.  The music really fits in well with the film. I recommend this film for anyone who is familiar with meth use, otherwise, the movie may sort of go over a non-user's head.  The Unrated Version is the ONLY way to go.  DO NOT BUY THE R-Rated version.  There are many crucial scenes either missing or censored.  In the end, ""Spun"" is a great movie with good emotional ups and downs.

BANG!) at the door.

Most drug movies take the stereotypical way out.  Pot joke here.  Lame message or lesson there.  With Spun, however, and the brilliant cast led by Mickey Rourke and Brittany Murphy, there is a bit more grease on the wheel, and the previous paragraph is the best I can do to truly represent the bizarre trip that Spun represents.

The movie follows Ross (Jason Schwartzman) - a borderline psychotic meth-head - over the course of three or four days, as he meanders his way throughout the drug world for each successively needed hit.  Starting off at the house of a frantic small-time dealer named Spider Mike (John Lequizamo), whose paranoia and persona are a mix of battered ping-pong ball and horny schizophrenic, Ross meets Spider Mike's junkie girlfriend Cookie (Mena Suvari, who was obviously affected by the Gateway drug in American Beauty), and a fellow addict named Frisbee.  When Spider Mike loses his stash - drugs'll do that to ya' - Ross moves up to the big leagues through Nikki (Murphy) - who personifies the drug-addicted stripper in nearly every role she plays; so, she nails the character - to The Cook (Rourke).  The Cook is the coolest burnout ever, spewing out prophecy and poetry, both wise and ignorant, while convincing Ross to be his personal chauffer, paying him in small bags of drugs, like a dog being rewarded for playing fetch.

The rest is all about burning the candle at both ends, following addicts as day and night blends together in a hallucinatory cartoon of never-ending cravings.  For the most part, the acting is superb.  As mentioned, Rourke and Murphy are great, but Suvari is unconvincing, and a bit role from Eric Roberts is simply horrible.  How far he has fallen from Best of the Best (and I am dead serious).

Ingeniously filmed, the blending of every imaginable artistic expression is there, but that's the strength as well as the weakness.  At times the trip is quite distracting from the message.  When it comes down to it, however, maybe that's the point?  Maybe the skittish delivery is meant to be a pure depiction of the rambling affects of addiction.  I enjoyed it for what it's worth, but not enough to become addicted; I just needed a taste.",1240790400,2,2607,4.997685185185185

1505616,4,B00005JM23,"If it doesn't bother you when a director blatantly rips off another movie, take this one for a spin. It's Requiem for a Dream for the methamphetamine crowd. Not as good, of course, but it's a fun ride. Lots of quick edits, lots of Oliver Stone weird, sweaty, extreme close-ups, and absolutely no substance. It's just a week, or so, in the life of a bunch of speed freaks. Nothing more.

Billy Corgan contributes some good stuff, via Djali Zwan to the soundtrack and gets in a quick cameo. There are lots of cameos alongside the ensemble cast. Leguizamo's a little over the top, and Mena Suvari seemed a little stretched, but all in all not too bad. This is a much better role for Brittany Murphy than Love and Other Disasters. It's a fine line between over-acting and acting like you're freakin' on speed, so I'm not going to complain.

Spun is also surprisingly explicit in a number of ways: Leguizamo's masturbation scene wearing nothing but a sock; the shot of a little turd splashing in the toilet while Sorvino takes a dump; a girl tied to a bed for pretty much the length of the movie, naked and spread eagle with gaffer's tape over her mouth and eyes forced to listen to a skipping CD the whole time.

There is no moral to the story. Heck, there really isn't any story. It's just one big buzz with events. I don't mind that it's a Requiem for a Dream clone in style, not substance. I would imagine this kind of physical film making via power-edits would be difficult to do, and I think this first time director did a credible job.",1218758400,,1537,4.443262411347518

1505670,2,B00005JM23,"Spun (Jonas Akerlund, 2002)

The DVD box for Spun has a blurb on it calling it ""a classic of drug cinema"". Which strikes me as saying ""the cutest hemorrhagic fever imaginable"" or something like that. When you're in a genre containing such deathless film classics as Half Baked and How High?, it doesn't strike me that you really have to reach all that high to grab the bar, now, do you?

The story revolves around Ross (Rushmore's Jason Schwartzman, whose career has been downhill ever since). Ross is the guy with the car, which makes him very important-- none of the other major characters has one. Ross and his friends (and the series of oddballs he meets on the way), you see, are tweakers-- crystal meth addicts. Most of them, aside from being too stoned to drive, don't have cars because, presumably, they've hocked them to get money to fuel their addictions. But someone's gotta do the driving, and that someone is Ross. As it opens, we meet Ross, his paranoid dealer Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), and Spider Mike's two houseguests, Nikki (Brittany Murphy) and Cookie (Mena Suvari). As things progress, Ross is introduced to Cookie's boyfriend, The Cook (Mickey Rourke), Spider Mike's supplier, who also needs some driving done. The Cook hires Ross to do some driving for him. Which is great, Ross needs the money (and the drugs), except that Ross has his girlfriend (Chloe Hunter, whose body famously appears on the poster for American Beauty) tied to the bed in his apartment. (Why? We don't know.) Along the way, we meet a number of other assorted weirdos, the most interesting of whom is Frisbee (Deadbirds' Patrick Fugit), a black metal devotee who gets involved in a very bizarre love triangle with Spider Mike and Nikki. Plot? Forget plot. This is a slice-of-very-strange-life movie.

When I was watching Spun, I hated it. To some extent, I still do. But a week or so later, I find myself impressed with a number of aspects of the movie. Kudos to both Suvari and Murphy, both of whom have been typecast as glamour girls for years, for taking roles that are unglamorous in the extreme. The number of cameos in the movie is astounding-- Deborah Harry, Ron Jeremy, Billy Corgan, Rob Halford, Peter Stormare, and I'm only touching the tip of the iceberg. And for a plotless movie, it does go by quickly (this could well have to do with the insane editing-- Akerlund normally makes his paycheck as a music video director, and the camerawork here has a great deal in common with his infamous video for The Prodigy's ""Smack My [...] Up""). Schwartzman is just kind of pulled along by everything, but a number of the other performances in here range from the competent (Harry, Fugit, Suvari) to the downright wicked (this may well be Rourke's best role since Angel Heart). And while the whole movie doesn't hold up, there are some blisteringly funny scenes (Corgan has one line, but in the greater context of its scene, it's hysterical).

So-- not as awful as I first thought, but I probably won't be sitting through it again any time soon. **",1199318400,,3048,4.734463276836158

1505672,4,B00005JM23,"A friend (and former tweaker) recommended this, saying it captured the meth ""lifestyle"" perfectly. I've never done meth, but after watching Spun, I was jittery, irritable, and an hour later wanted to watch it again... so I'd say  my friend was probably right.

It probably goes without saying that this film isn't for everyone.  None of the characters are likeable or even have redeeming qualities: they've all sold their souls to the drug, and their lives are all but destroyed by it.  There is no plot: characters just drift aimlessly from scene to scene, fix to fix.  The cinemetography is very difficult to get used to, as it seems to simulate a meth POV: the camera is always in motion, there are lots of quick, intense close-ups of trivial items, and frenetic hyper-editing (over 5,000 cuts in 101 minutes.)

That said, I really liked the film.  Spun struck me as a very dark comedy, but the ""humor"" isn't so much laugh-out-loud as it is shaking your head in horror and saying ""oh God, no!""  If you know what ""schadenfreud"" is, Spun epitomizes it.

I rented this from Netflix, which apparently only offers the ""rated"" version.  It is sanitized down from what would almost certainly be NC-17 with lots of language beeps and nudity blurs.  I haven't seen the ""unrated"" version, but if Spun were something you wanted to own, that would almost certainly be the one you want to get.  Still, you can get the feel for the film from the rated version.

1505677,3,B00005JM23,"A lot of the criticism I've read about this movie has to do with the editing.  To which I say: did all those jump cuts make you jumpy?  Well, that's probably the point - to try and propel you the viewer into the confused and addled mindset of a fiending meth junkie.  MY only problem is - once that point is made, the rest of the movie is kind of pointless (although, maybe the other point was to make a movie that's as much of a mess as the characters it represents.  And while that wouldn't exactly be a propitious goal, at least it's a goal that they reached).

Granted, some of the skittish shots are beautifully composed - clearly it was a labor of (unrequited?) love to assemble so many artful shots only to run rampant with the jump cut Ginsu knife.  And the opening title sequence is gorgeous.  I could have watched it forever (which is both good and bad, since what I'm ultimately saying is this movie would have worked better as a music video).

It's a fine line (and one of the only ones that doesn't get snorted in the film), but sometimes a movie's style can get in the way of its substance.  And, in the worst cases, sometimes its style serves to mask a lack of substance.  This film suffers symptoms from both of these syndromes.  I appreciate its aim, but for me the target was never quite hit.

The ""comic"" moments aren't that funny and the serious moments are undermined by the previous attempts at comedy.  The acting is a bit forced and tone-deaf at times (Mena Suvari is surprisingly stilted and just can't seem to be convincingly hyperactive, but Brittany Murphy is actually really good).

The writing is subpar - there are no truly memorable lines that stuck in my mind (for which these kinds of movies are usually reliable).  Plot?  Not really.  Guy drives around, leaves a girl in bed, tries to call his girlfriend.  Which would be fine, if the movie was a slice of life or a character study, but this doesn't really feel like much of either.

Most of the celebrity cameos (Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins, Ron Jeremy of porn) are distracting and kind of useless (still, I can't bring myself to type anything mean about Debbie Harry, so I won't).

And by the time Mickey Rourke gets around to telling his ""old dog"" tale to a sleeping Jason Schwartzman, I'm practically comatose myself.  So when the movie finally reaches its supposedly explosive climax, I'm numb.  I'm spent.  I'm spun.  I'm done.  Again, maybe that's the point.  But it ain't no fun.

I'd like to give this movie 2.5 stars, but since I have to round up or down, I'll give it credit for being ambitious in what it's trying to do (as well as being so visually intoxicating) and round up to three.",1171670400,10,2718,4.471544715447155

1505745,5,B00005JM23,"So, most people have never experienced anything close to the heavy drug use depicted in this film.

At first glance, Spun is exceedingly obscene and pornographic, and the editing is enough to make anyone dizzy.  However, not only does it excellently depict the drug sensations, the movie has a moral as well.  I fully believe that the lack of character development and plot (according to numerous critics) is intentional -- drug abuse doesn't just suddenly get a happy ending, nor does it have any essential purpose beyond the feelings of the drugs.

And in the end, that's what this movie delivers: the experience of a pointless week-long meth binge, and a glimpse at the kind of life few of us would believe exists.  Imagine the events of Spun expanded into a year, many years -- people actually live this way, losing days like drops in a bucket of water, doing what they can to get the next high.  Extremely important things are simply forgotten, drama explodes as the drugs twist emotions..

There are so many elements of this movie that are thought-provoking, when you get past the layers of grime and tweak editing.  A great many people won't care to get past the surface, and understandably so..  You might have seen this kind of depravity in the first half of A Clockwork Orange, but never presented in such a visceral way.  Beneath the surface is a silent cautionary tale -- everything from constantly blinking Fasten Seatbelts lights to Ross taking another bump as you cringe ""again??"" and prepare for another sensory assault..

1505748,4,B00005JM23,"There are dozens of Don't Do Drugs flicks that feel like after-school specials, with their sluggish morals and predictable endings. Well, I can say that the ending of this movie was predictable, but the build-up to it, the acting and the finesse with which the special effects were implemented (voices going in and out of focus, characters in fast forward, teeth grinding) had me SPUN from beginning to end.

Though Brittany Murphy gets most of the cover, the story is really about Ross (Jason Schwartzmann), a part of a screwed-up extended family that are all hooked on methamphetamines, including secondhand dealer Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), spaced-out game geek Frisbee (Patrick Fugit), and others. When Ross meets Nikki (Murphy), he gets hooked up to the real deal: a man that calls himself the Cook, who wears boots with spurs and a cowboy hat and spits, fights, and tweaks like a man. The movie, for the most part, follows Ross's exploits as he becomes the Cook's errand boy, ferrying Nikki around in exploits like taking her dog to the vet (who has turned green from too much inhalation), and otherwise taking the Cook out to score, buy beer and porn, etc.

The best part about this movie is the dead-on behavior of the junkies. They hug and kiss you, they reassure you with pretty lies, they make you feel right at home - but the second they're short on drugs, or you say the wrong thing to them, they scream and throw things around. The next day you're friends again until the next fight, which is never very far off. And though you are led to believe through the whole movie that the Cook is the head cheese, it is interesting (and accurate) to discover that he is reporting to someone even bigger. And yuck, is the personal hygiene right on the nose for these characters - their teeth are gritty, their clothes dirty and raggedy, and through the few days we follow them it doesn't appear that any one of them ever takes a shower. All they want - no, need - is their next fix.

The part that sold me from the beginning was the words that came onscreen as the film started up:

1505750,5,B00005JM23,"'Spun' follows the lives of several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted, roller coaster days, but this is not your ordinary 'drug' film.  The ambience and atmosphere is so in-tuned with this degenerated culture that you can smell the illegal drugs cooking.  Giving the plot away would be moot, since it is a portrayal of everyday life for people of this particular scene.

So, what separates 'Spun' from the rest of the drug flicks?  Gritty realism, hilariously bizarre scenes, atmosphere, some great acting, and a complete lack of fear on the part of the creator and the director to dive into the nastiest of behaviors and expose them as pathetic and comical.

The sets are what you will see in real life meth houses.  The dress and behavior of the characters is very realistic.  My only real problem with the movie is that some of the jerk/flash camera work gets a little annoying, but still serves its purpose of bringing the ""tweak"" to the screen.

Interspersed in the film are some ridiculous cartoon scenes that are a riot, and two cops that parody TV shows like ""Cops"" and ""Bounty Hunters"", along with flash stills and hilarious action music.  I am going to be haunted forever by the Spider Mike (John Leguizamo) scene where he is jumping up and down on the bed with a sock on his unit while abusing himself.  You'll see what I mean, Leguizamo is brilliant in his role.

Mickey Rourke has proven himself to be quite an actor, a chameleon who can adapt to any role.  In 'Spun', he plays The Cook, a nasty loosing white trash cowboy type who cooks the dope for the gang.  Watch for Ross's (Jason Schwartzman) hallucination of The Cook's all-American speech in the video store.  ""Ask not what the kitty can do for you (substitute the 'P' word for kitty), but what you can do for the kitty.""

Look for a surprising performance from Brittany Murphy (Just Married, Sin City) as Nikki.  The more I see of Brittany's work, the more I like her as an actress.  Eric Roberts (playing The Man) may have had one bad role after another, but his part in 'Spun' is perfect for him and very well done.  The Man, with his earring and his muscle boys and his overdone lisp was too funny to watch.  Roberts worked with Rourke in 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' back in the early 80's, and its plain that they still mesh as actors.

Watch for Debra Harry (80's group Blondie) as Ross's nosy neighbor, and Ron Jeremy, the king of p*rn, as the bartender in the strip club.  All in all, 'Spun' is a movie with a serious twist that will leave you laughing in the wake of the character's bizarre activities.  This is one of the best drug/bad behavior movies I have watched, right up there with 'Requiem For A Dream' and 'Kids'.  Truly, a must-see movie.  Enjoy!",1142899200,21,2751,4.56734693877551
1505751,3,B00005JM23,"This film suffers from a fatal flaw:  it is a stylistic carbon copy of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, only somewhat less horrific and a great deal funnier.  Which is a shame because nearly everything else about it is flawless.  The obvious virtues:  outstanding casting, acting, writing, directing.  The less obvious virtue:  exceptional attention to detail.  While there are endless examples, to me the most memorable is that of Jason Schwartzman holding up his little plastic bag of speed to settle its contents. For a moment, all the noise and vertigo in this film stops with a gentle flick of his grubby thumb and forefinger.",1142812800,2,619,4.894230769230769

1505753,1,B00005JM23,"When I got this movie, I couldn't enjoy it because I was so put off by the obvious, rampant censorship. Cuss words were actually bleeped out and images were fuzzed over, even cartoon images for Pete's sake. I'm glad the 'zon offers an ""unrated"" version, but when I got this movie, there was no mention whatsoever on the box that it had been severely edited. The responsible parties of tightwadanalretentiveweenies teed me off so much I was actually compelled to rain hellfire on both the movie studio and the video store where I got it (they refunded my money).

Aside from the issue of protecting children, censorship has no place in a free society. Fortunately, more Americans are becoming aware that this continues to be a serious problem, particularly on television news, and they're doing something about it. How ironic that America is known as ""the land of the free"" when many other countries, especially in Europe, have far fewer restraints and enjoy a much higher level freedom - mainly because tight-wad right-wing Christians who want to control the way everyone thinks have way too much power over here.",1136678400,13,1113,4.888888888888889

1505813,5,B00005JM23,"I am so sick of movies that follow the same old plot over and over again- Spun drastically breaks this rule...and ventures out into it's own world- which I thought, was great. This has to be one of my all time favorite movies- it is fast paced, action filled, and best of all the actors & actresses are top notch in fitting into their roles.

Brittany Murphy I think does a fantastic job as playing Niki....her performance is similar to her playing in Clueless as a dumb-airhead blonde combined with her work done in Bongwater.. minus the oversexed part. Then there is Jason Schwartzman which surprised me none-the least with his performance. He deffinatly delivered it in this film- both acting wise and his physical appearance- which fit in perfectly with the rest of the cast. Another favorite of mine was Cookie- or Mena Suvari. Although she didn't get much air time I enjoyed her acting SO much and her schizoid-paranoid personality. And that's probably the best part of this movie...the personalities of these six speed-freaks.

Rent the movie- (get the unrated version), make sure there are no kids around....and get ready to go for a very trippy ride...",1136160000,,1161,4.8291457286432165
1505814,1,B00005JM23,"I've watched the movie and I can only come to two conclusions for why this movie was made. A) The director was trippin' as badly on acid as Brittany in the movie, or B) you have to be stoned to enjoy it.

Through the movie we follow Mr Big Dealer and his bimbo fried girlfriend Nikki. Nikki's boyfriend makes the dope at home and he likes to watch porn. Then there's Cookie and her wannabe-drug-dealer-boyfriend Spider-Mike (?!).. You guessed it, they're trippin' too.. Ross just wants to get high so he drops by Spider Mike's place one time Nikki is around. Nikki makes him a deal, and through the rest of the movie we watch Ross tie up his lover in his bed while he's off snorting with his new friends. Basically, if they're not doing acid, they're doing acid.

The only sane one in this movie is Taco, watch out for him.

1505818,5,B00005JM23,"I'm always surprised that this movie is cross-marketed with Requiem for a Dream. Requiem is a much darker hellish downward spiral. Spun is a lighter, irrervant, and funny (at times and if you have a dark sense of humor) look at a completely different drug and lifestyle--crystal meth tweakers. This movie is rich with absoslute zany, off-the-wall characters, from John Leguizamo's paranoid, self-obsessed dealer character, to Mena Suvari's unwashed, unkept addict, to Mickey Rourke as the completely unbalanced and very vivid The Cook. The plot is a little flimsy, but aren't the lives of drug users kind of dream-like, trance-like, and without a clear linear plot? This can be viewed as a series of manic music video scenes, but put together, this is a compelling film about drug abuse that avoids preaching to the audience, chosing instead just to demonstrate.

Fans of this movie should also check out dark comedies such as SLC Punk! and The Opposite of Sex.",1126915200,,961,5.044025157232705

This movie has humor, drama, and disturbing scenes all rolled into one. (Depending upon how open-minded you are.) There was alot of controversy about this film with comparing it to Requiem for a Dream. But personally, I've never thought the two were THAT much alike. Requiem was much more deeper and darker.

1505821,3,B00005JM23,"First of all, wannabe critics, the movie Spun has nothing to do with Los Angeles or California.  In fact, it is never mentioned in the movie where the story takes place.  However, if you had done any research before you wrote your review, you would know that Will De Los Santos wrote the story about experiences from his matriculation at the University of Oregon.  During the movie there are at least 2 references to this fact: 1) Jason Swartzman wears an U of O letterman's jacket (suitably w/o the varsity letter) as his costume  2) The strip club ""Jiggles,"" a wholesome Oregon mini-chain for ""Harmless visual stimuli"", mentioned twice in the film, used to be right on W. 11th behind the Pak 'n' Save.  Withholding that the Eugene/Springfield area produces more meth-amphetamine than PA,NY, and NJ combined, only if you were out crack-shopping or soliciting hookers would you recognize Circus Liquors as being part of N. hollywood and think this an LA tale.

  Now, as for the movie... when you think of it as a little Eugene addict's diary on film its kinda cute, and would have been entertaining if De Los Santos had made the movie himself (he tried and failed in Morocco).  With MTV's Ackerman directing, the project turned into a quirky music video with the kind of tongue-in-cheek displayed in ""Smack My Bitch Up"", sheltering the audience from the truly sordid lifestyle of the addict.  This is a portrait of a young man's life unravelling, and shouldn't be as forgiving or comic as it is.  This depiction robs its veiwers of the very real situations that drown addicts in a nightmare collapse of tenuously placed dominos that is the structure of their lives.  The past, the present and future collide vacuously in an addicts mind, their lives and relationships futilely become based on nothing but the drug.  Watching this movie will make you laugh at drug addicts, and will never give you real insight into what being an out-of-control, scattered, drug-addled tweaker really is!",1121472000,6,1987,4.86053412462908

i would have to say that the best scene in this movie is the end which i won't give avay, the one with mickey rourke, but the other scene i liked alot is where this kid locked and tied down his 'girlfriend' in his room for 3 days with a cd that keeps skipping loud as hell. i'm not sure if it lands on the really disturbing or really funny side, but it is entertaining.",1120867200,8,820,4.061728395061729

It centers mainly around Ross and Nikki and The Cook(Mikey Rouke) in which The Cook has Ross do jobs for him and he drives him around town in exchange for Meth. Ross has been up on Meth for days and days. Then, all somehow everybody's whole lives go spinning down the drain, as one by one of them have some key event that signals the beginning of the end for them.

This film wears its influences on its sleeves. I was noticing hints of Lost Highway(The long road with only headlights to light it up), The animation sequences from Natural Born Killers, and the downfall of all the characters lives and the ending from Requiem For A Dream. Some people have written reviews saying that this movie is a Requiem For A Dream rip-off. When in retrospect, that is only part of the plot. The film has a highly original way  of telling the story, and Jonas kerlund provides his music video experience, which sucessfully gels with the pace, tone, and feel of the movie. The movie was fast paced, head-spinning, weird, quirky, and random. The cast was maginificant, Jason Schwartzman was great as Ross, he really got the part down, and did a solid performance. Brittany Murphy as Nikki was solid, too. Although, I don't like some of the movies that she was in. She really took this part and made it shine. John Lezigumo's performance was outstanding in the short amount of time that he had on screen. Same thing goes to Mena Suvari. Patrick Fugit was disapponting, mainly because nothing really big happend to his character towards the end. Mickey Rourke as The Cook was brillant, because The Cook was cool, and Mickey Rourke is cool.

In going for realism the writer's neglected to find a statement to be made about the behavior being presented.  It's not that I feel every film needs that, but this one does.  This film is a very dirty, rude, and lewd presentation of the life of drug dealers and their clients and it doesn't glamorize that lifestyle, which I credit the movie for doing.  I just don't know why they decided to tell this story, to make this art.

1505885,3,B00005JM23,"I decided to rent this film after reading reports of a serious methamphetamine epidemic in my hometown. Already having some brief experience with this scene and its denizens - some acquaintances of mine in college indulged/abused the substance - I pretty much knew what to expect, and in that regard *Spun* hit all the right notes, reconfirming the horrid extremities that make up this by-the-moment existence of abuse, degradation and constant, unsatisfied addiction.

*Spun* chronicles three days (""three? or four? or three?"") in the transient lives of So-Cal tweakers.  The characters are vividly drawn, complete with excellent costume-garb and cartoonish titles. We begin with: the paranoid dealer Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), his filthy girlfriend Cookie (Mena Suvari), and a necronerd ADD poseur by the name of Frisbee.  These, however, are periphery to the triumvirate of Ross (Jason Schwartzman), a greasy-looking everyman; Nikki (Brittany Murphy) a implausible-fit methhead whom he meets at Spider Mike's, and her paramour The Cook (Mickey Rourke), a meth-chemist, pusher and stoned philosopher.  The `plot' consists of this cast scoring, snorting, smoking and/or shooting their drug of choice, and how, afterward, the ways they seek to acquire more tweak and/or cope with said lifestyle.

To be more specific, the main thread of *Spun* hinges around Ross carting Nikki and The Cook about in his battered Volvo on various missions, scoring little bags of dope as a reward.  ""How long have you managed to stay up on this stuff?"" Ross asks The Cook during one such errand.  ""Twelve or thirteen days,"" Mickey Rourke replies in a typical performance: the cowboy-burnout, world-weary and impeccably `cool': but this method of madness actually enhances *Spun* tremendously.  Rourke gives a standout performance in his career, and the tenuous relationship of mentor/protg between Ross and The Cook slowly exposes, by jerk and twitter, the unifying thread by which these people manage to make it day-in, day-out: burning the candle at both ends, looking ever forward to the next hit and ignoring the damage wrought in the meantime.

It's rather unfortunate that *Spun* borrows quite heavily from a number of films, for the audience finds itself forced to compare the movie with its predecessors.  *Requiem for a Dream* is the most obvious influence, with the constant eye-surge shots and several key editing techniques, as is *Trainspotting* - the opening monologue practically invites comparison - and indeed, the juxtaposition of grimy addiction-subsistence and zany humor makes *Spun* a photo negative of the latter example.  *Trainspotting* worked in large part to its `lust for life', the strangely uplifting quality to the writing and character development.  The same cannot be said for this film: despite moments of earned levity and some truly bizarre animation sequences (the video-game hallucination standing out as particularly disturbing to these eyes), *Spun* is dark, negative and grim - just like meth - but it fails to successfully balance its humor and drama, struggling to find even ground in the integration of tragedy and comedy.

This unevenness is epitomized in the undercover cop subplot, which should have been excised from the film in my opinion, or at least radically reworked.  For 1) it's not particularly funny, at least not anywhere near as funny as it tries to be 2) it's a clich 3) it comes off contrived, breaking the spell of the movie, and 4) the attempted parody - 70's style copper-drama editing and dialogue - serves in ultimately subverting the pain and emotive catharsis intrinsic in the meth-abuse material.

Still, the way the director manages to combine and build upon his varied influences suggests an artist who has skillfully emulated and synthesized these elements a la Quintin Tarentino; hopefully on future films he will be able to step beyond homage and fashion something (breathtakingly) original. Above all else, *Spun* certainly shows promise.

~Potential Spoilers:~

The last image, beautifully shot, can be taken literally... but I wonder, given the (general) competence The Cook displays throughout.  Rather, I prefer to see it as a symbol for how these addicts subsist: fuel for the constant burn.

~End Spoilers~

World religions tend to focus on the dichotomy of a Heaven and a Hell - tranquility for the blessed, punishment for the wicked.  In my view, Heaven and Hell is a metaphor for how people choose to spend their lives; and for a fairly accurate scrutiny of Hell in its refined form, look no further than *Spun* and its assortment of damned souls.  One glimpse should be enough.",1106006400,9,4647,5.242914979757085
1505886,4,B00005JM23,"No use rehashing the facts presented by all the other reviewers. The simple point I want to make is that Spun is fun movie to watch. It is full of little touches that made me laugh and kept me interested, such as the opening song, the CD skipping as Ross leaves the girl tied up, and the green dog.

I haven't watched every drug movie in the world, and maybe Spun is a knockoff as others have stated, but I make this analogy: Spun is to ""Requiem for a Dream"" as a Cheech & Chong movie is to ""Reefer Madness"". That overstates the difference a bit, as Cheech & Chong was strictly comedy and I would call Spun comedy/drama, but I think you will find that the basic analogy is valid.

If you want an afterschool special to scare your kids and teach them a lesson, show them Requiem, not Spun. Although bad things ultimately happen to the characters, they're just not all that miserable. Likewise, after watching the movie, you're not all that miserable. You may even have a smile on your face and a chuckle in your heart, thinking, ""Those goofy speed freaks...""

If you want misery, watch Requiem. For fun, watch Spun.",1105833600,3,1114,4.424390243902439
1505887,4,B00005JM23,"""Spun"" will inevitably draw comparisons to Darren Aronofsky's generally superior film ""Requiem for a Dream."" The latter movie, based on Hubert Selby's soul shattering novel of the same name, dealt with the theme of addiction in a way rarely witnessed in other films. The story traces the disintegration of four individuals, three hooked on heroin and one on diet pills and television, in a manner that will break your heart. As crushing as the book is, Aronofsky's movie really drives the point home in an even more horrific way. Moreover, his use of a talented cast--including Jennifer Connolly, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn--will reduce you to a quivering wreck. All four so completely disappear into their roles as damaged human beings that any other film daring to tread the same ground faces an uphill task. What does ""Spun"" offer us to supplant our recollections of ""Requiem for a Dream""? Jason Schwartzman, Mena Suvari, Brittny Murphy, John Leguzamo, Patrick Fugit, and Mickey Rourke. There are some fine actors in that list, but can they possibly trump the magical foursome of the other film? In some ways, perhaps, but overall they cannot. ""Spun"" is a shameless rip-off of Aronofsky's film.

It is, however, an intriguing rip-off. The film follows four or five days in the lives of several Los Angeles based speed addicts as they struggle to score amidst a plethora of personal problems. Main character Ross (Schwartzman) spends all of his time cruising around town in his jalopy, calling his former girlfriend to leave messages on her answering machine bemoaning their breakup, and stopping by a sleazy drug den run by the tattooed Spider Mike (Leguzamo). This character, who earns his livelihood selling crank to a number of upstanding citizens, is more paranoid than the John Birch Society. Chez Spider houses several zombies worth mentioning, including Mike's dentally challenged girlfriend Cookie (Suvari), former socialite turned basket case Nikki (Murphy), and gene pool disaster/lobotomy candidate Frisbee (Patrick Fugit). Ross, who tied his girlfriend to his bed back at the sewer he calls an apartment (?), must exercise efforts of herculean dimensions if he is to successfully score in an abode filled to the rafters with neuroses, psychopathologies, and physical confrontations. Fortunately for him, Nikki claims allegiance to a man responsible for producing most of the methamphetamine in Los Angeles, The Cook (Rourke), and she promises to bring Ross in on the action if he will chauffer them around town.

As cracked as the above characters are, they pale in comparison to The Cook. Safely ensconced in the confines of a cheap motel room, this grungy chap refuses to sell any crank before its time. He parcels out bits of speed to Ross in exchange for rides to the local gas station, to a video store where Rob Halford of ""Judas Priest"" runs the cash register, and even to the man bankrolling The Cook's entire operation (Eric Roberts in a hilarious role). At one point, Ross helps take Nikki's dog to the vet's office after a tragic accident resulted in the animal receiving a most unusual dye job. Subplots spring up like weeds only to pass away into insignificance, such as Ross's suspicious neighbor (Deborah Harry) and her efforts to learn what's going on in his apartment. There are also relationship problems between Nikki and The Cook that need fixing, a couple of cops on the trail of Frisbee and Spider Mike, and a liquor store where two Hispanic chicks giggle the hours away watching The Cook and later Ross's neighbor beat the same guy into unconsciousness. Confused yet? I suspect that's the idea: throw a whole bunch of offbeat characters strung out on speed into a series of chaotic scenarios, reasons the director, and you might just replicate the disordered world of your everyday drug user.

""Spun"" is more interesting for its appearance than its nonlinear plot. The film boasts a hazy, washed out color scheme that gives the proceedings a sort of hyperreal look and feel. Then there is the manic camera work: zipping, zagging, and zooming around all over the place. ""Spun"" contains so many jump cuts and other quick editing techniques that the film makes MTV look like an episode of Masterpiece Theater. This movie even uses a variation of the eye gag used in ""Requiem for a Dream."" Shameless, I say, but ""Spun"" is an interesting take on one of our greatest problems today. Moreover, the performances help propel the movie to its explosive denouement. Schwartzman's twitchy mannerisms and rough appearance prove he's got range and is ready to move on to grittier roles. I don't like Brittny Murphy, but even she does a good job as a former beauty now trolling the gutter. The most astonishing element of ""Spun"" is Mickey Rourke, a once promising actor reduced to accepting B-budget films in the past decade. He's as weird as ever--maybe more so here--in a role that demands oddness on a metaphysical scale. No matter what your perceptions of the movie, ""Spun"" will keep you on your toes.

The extras on the unrated disc are bountiful. Two commentary tracks, trailers, a music video, and deleted scenes add additional time to the viewing experience. Perhaps the biggest problem with ""Spun"" is that it doesn't make you root for the characters, let alone feel an empathy with them, like ""Requiem for a Dream"" does. Aronofsky's film provided enough backstory so the viewer could understand why the characters embarked on such self-destructive behavior. We only see a portion of that here, and what we do see isn't as deep or as meaningful as in ""Requiem."" Cinema fans will want to check ""Spun"" out, however, since it's more than likely to attain cult status at some point in the future.",1104192000,3,5741,4.977083333333334
1505888,3,B00005JM23,"it's hard to review this film. it was entertaining, but it wasn't really good. the story was very unrealistic. If this was in fact the average day of a speed-freak, then there would be no such thing as a crank-head anymore. most of the characters ended up in jail and they were CRAZY. Read the sypnosis on the back. This is the ""Reefer Madness"" or ""Cocaine Feinds"" of methamphetamines. They made everyone so beat-up looking and dramatized the effects of crystal meth. It's ridiculous how much this film was merely trying to shock. Unnecessarily graphic, akward amount of cursing, unrealistically filthy homes and a drug-addict image so outlandish and cliche that it comes off as if a middle-school health teacher or a DARE-officer put their collective minds together to see how terrible they could make the characters seem. Not only that, but they juiced ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Trainspotting"", and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (to name a few) for all they were worth and made a rip-off so melodramatic and corny that it becomes an insult. Honestly, I think this movie was trying to jump on to the ""Requiem..."" craze and tried to do so by making the same movie over with an allstar cast, more eyecandy, and by trying to outoffend, if you will, previous ""drug"" movies (you see, when trite filmmakers jump on the bandwagon they eventually make innovations cliches and create new pigeonholes). That being said, the cast was good and the film was entertaining and visually-appealing despite being completely stale and unorigional.",1102118400,,1530,4.934108527131783
1505957,4,B00005JM23,"Contrary to what all the other reviewers said, this movie very well depicts what the life of a crank user would be, atleast in some way. For instance, when one reviewer was crying over the ending that they didn't understand, it all makes since, if you went on a 3 day meth binge and slept for none of it, as soon as you stop using, your going to pass out.

I feel the movie crammed tons of material in it for being not to lengthy, and i think it did it perfect, not as dark and depressing as Reqeuim for a Dream, but just as true and fun to watch.

The crazy editing and shots are there for a reason people, to make you feel like your the one useing methanphetamine, and i feel it couldn't have been done better unless some crank was included with the movie...

The characters really play the parts well, and seem to be alittle more normal than one would expect of a meth head, but it all comes into the light when you see the true side of it when Ross finnaly talks to his hott (so called) girlfriend, and he stutters away and can barely follow her words.

Altogether a great entertaining story mixed with some really funny parts and i think this is what makes it better than Reqeuim.

1505958,4,B00005JM23,"Watching this movie actually makes me feel a little ill, due to the fact that the characters, sets and story details are so REALISTIC. To see such characters as Mena Suvari looking so repulsive (contrary to her ususal american beauty as displayed in other movies) adds to the realism, because I have known so called ""Beautiful"" people who have turned up later looking and acting like these characters. Its almost spooky to see how one's lifestyle choices can totally change one's appearance & behaviours. The tricky camera work and extreme closeups just intensify the experience (though they do go a little overboard at times), and make the viewer feel as if s/he is actually there, experiencing it all. It is also great to see Deborah Harry reprise her Intimate Stranger-esque phone sex role too.
My creative writing teacher, back in high school used to always say that the object of the writer is to move the reader, which doesn't always mean to make the reader feel pleasant. The movie makers in this film do move this viewer, so, as far as I am concerned they have more than done their job.",1101859200,4,1094,4.732984293193717

Still, these people (with the exception of Mickie Rourke, who is worth the entire movie), came across as almost cutesy.  In the end, everyone falls asleep happily ever after, with their eye make-up on perfect!  Come on, how realistic is THAT in the crank world?  Enough said, the movie was highly entertaining, nonetheless.  The lesser characters helped out a lot (Deborah Harry, Patrick Fugate, Eric Roberts and, of course, Rourke). Billy Corgan's soundtrack was perfect.  If they just hadn't been so cute and cuddly and had such a happy ending, but, it was all right if you're looking for a little more ballsy American Pie.",1097539200,,684,4.803418803418803

I've never seen a more affected & self-conscious acting job, it's totally embarassing to both the actor and director). and that goes for any of the actors in this ""film"" (exception: Mickey Rourke, who pretty much just sleep-walks through this one). anyone who was involved with this project ought to feel pretty stupid & I'm actually sort of embarassed for you.

the writing is about as un-inventive, un-imaginative & flat as it gets. the over-reliance on camera / editing trickery gets old after about 2 minutes. the characters are ridiculously un-believable (example: why, why would a guy tie a naked girl up to a bed after he's just had sex with her & leave her there for days, with her mouth duct-taped? oh yeah, because he's ""f'ed up on speed"". pssh. whatever).

overall, I found this to be an obnoxious, smug, waaay too self-conscious, and painfully obvious appeal to the lowest common denominator of an audience. it'll find an audience with people who don't know any better. don't waste your $$ or more importantly, your time on this garbage. don't line the pockets of anyone involved with this waste of film & talent.",1097280000,7,1335,4.850877192982456
1505961,3,B00005JM23,"It's very evident with Spun's cinematography, extreme close-ups, quick cuts and high speed fast forwards that it aspires to reach the heights of Requiem for A Dream.  Spun starts off promising but when it reaches the point when Akerlund has to decide whether or not to deal with meth addiction with tragic realism, he takes the cowards way out and approaches the second half of this rather promising film with surreal slapstick comedy inspired by Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The surreal comic slant on drug addiction worked brilliantly in Fear and Loathing but falls uninspiringly flat in Spun. Akerlund is too afraid to go the bleak, shockingly realistic route (with the exception of the toilet bowl scene), is too sympathetic to his pathetic characters and too condescending to his audience.  Spun, which could have been a gritty, extreme, realistic portrait of meth addiction, suddenly veers off into the mundane.  I started moaning and groaning during the last forty-five minutes.  There are many long, unnecessary interludes of crappy folk music with pensive shots of the characters. Schwartzman looks remarkably like Jared Leto in Requiem.  We have to suffer through the antics of obnoxiously unrealistic meth addicted cops. Some situations should have been a bit more realistic (wouldn't the handcuffed girl be dead or close to death by the third day?  That would have been an interesting twist in the plot!)  and why did the gay drug dealer have to be such an insulting caricature?  John Leguizamo, as always, is brilliant and Brittany Murphy is engaging.  I only wish she would do more mature films than the teenybopper fare she usually stars in.  The acting and the first half of the film is the only saving grace here, although I found Mickey Rourke hard to swallow and felt Debbie Harry's appearance a complete waste of her time and talent.  If the story was a bit grittier Akerlund could have done for meth addiction what Aronofsky did for heroin addiction.  You don't come away from Spun feeling like you've been awake 72 hours with a bunch of speed freaks.  Instead, you come away feeling cheated like you did a line of baby powder instead of meth.  Worth giving a spin.",1096502400,4,2189,4.897018970189702
1505962,3,B00005JM23,"Reasons to watch this movie: Akerlund's direction is a hyperkinetic, wonderfully convoluted mess that seems to owe a lot to the work of Darren Aronofsky. If nothing else engages you in this movie, the direction certainly will - I found myself extremely tense for the entire film, as if I was watching something enormously suspenseful. The actors turn in very good performances, as well. Jason Schwartzman, who most remember as the kid from Rushmore, does an excellent job portraying a college speed junkie. Mickey Rourke and Brittany Murphy (who I usually find annoying, at best) aren't great, but they're certainly watchable, which is more than can be said for most of their other performances. John Leguizamo doesn't get nearly enough screen time in his role as a small-time dealer, but is excellent whenever he's onscreen.

Reasons not to watch this movie: Akerlund's direction - it's a pro and a con. If you like watching average Hollywood type movies, this one isn't for you. The plot is also paper-thin, and if there hadn't been terrific performances from the cast, this film would have been a complete mess.

Overall: I'd recommend it for the great performances and the direction (which I enjoyed, personally). It probably won't blow you away, but it's a relatively well-done movie.",1093737600,5,1289,5.046948356807512
1505963,4,B00005JM23,"This 2002 film is an explosive and quirky viewpoint of a group of speed freaks over the course of a few days.  There's some fine acting and excellent directing as well as outlandish use of animation.  It all comes together with the speed of lightning, sweeping me up in the experience and letting me leave my petty concerns of the day way behind.

Starring Jason Schwartman as a confused young man trying to win back an ex-girlfriend who has moved on to the corporate world, we share his constant highs and frustrations that come from constantly infusing huge doses of speed.  Mickey Rourke is as ""the cook"" who creates the concoctions craved by the addicts by melting down huge quantities of non-prescription pills.  Brittany Murphy is a pleasure to look at as Rourke's girlfriend.  And John Leguisizimo is cast as a petty drug dealer who is always in search of the next high.

Schwartman is so absent minded that he leaves his current girlfriend tied up in a motel for days.  Debbie Harry is the next door neighbor who rescues the girlfriend.  And we meet a wide assortment of speed freaks in various degrees of being high.  As a matter of fact, the film is so weirdly entertaining that it seems to bring that feeling of being high right to the audience.

Certainly, this film is not for everyone.  There's not much story and no moral conclusions.  It's just a fast paced slice of life in a world that is totally sleazy and weird.  I liked it as a change of pace and mildly recommend it for the curious.",1093305600,2,1505,4.5464684014869885

If you're one of the people thinking theres no plot, then you clearly haven't been spun/cant relate to the movie. I can say ive been there, and the life of a meth junkie is just that. No plot, no nothing. All there is to think about or do, is anything that will get you more quicker. The hours just sort of go by, with no real meaning. I thought the movie was an excellent example of showing what a junkies life revolves around. It showed how quickly extreme ups and downs can come and go, just like that. It shows how relationships can deminish, just like that, because the meth becomes more important. This movie did an awesome job of showing just how jaded you can become, and what your willing to do for another fix. I definately prefer this movie to requiem for a dream, although maybe its because i can really relate to this movie, everything going in fastforward and nothing matters until that next rail.",1091664000,6,1153,4.443396226415095

1506024,4,B00005JM23,"The Swedish music-video director Jonas kerlund gives us a movie about drugs. It is heavily inspired by greater drug-movies like ""Trainspotting"" (1996) and ""Requiem For A Dream"" (2000). But unlike most of the drug-movies I've seen earlier, ""Spun"" has no moral or deep meaning and message, it's just a film made to entertain and make you laugh. And it SURE made ME laugh...
Just as I wrote in the first line...this film is about drugs. It's hard to find a real plot in this film. It's just about people doing drugs, especially Speed (the word ""Spun"" means to be affected by Speed), and the their messed-up lives and everyday situations, seen through drug-affection. But while ""Spun"" doesn't have a real story, it has a some other qualities to offer: funny and well-created characters, good actors, a good soundtrack and A LOT of funny scenes and situations (it is bizarre humor though, that may not be recommended for everyone).
The main character Ross (played by Jason Schwartzman) is mostly a ""ordinary"" drug-abuser trapped in the sick world of drugs. But the other characters are funny, interesting and original. And the actors gives us these unrealistic, and sometimes almost cartoon-like characters, through some good acting. Characters like Spider Mike, played by John Leguizamo, a man I usually hate to see on the screen, and Frisbee, played by Patrick Fugit are highlights. But the one I will be remembering is Mickey Rourke in his role as The Cook (the one who's cooking up all the drugs). I could try to describe him, but it would have taken up too much space. You just have to see him for yourself...funniest character and performance of the film. Brittany Murphy is not only good-looking in this film, she's doing a good performance as the stripper Nikki. And let's not forget about Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette, who shows up as some weird characters in some of the craziest scenes in the whole film.
One thing that can be said about this film, is that it's weird. You can tell that Jonas kerlund is used to directing music-videos, because it may feel like a long music-video at times. And sometimes the film is so twisted that you just have to ask yourself ""what the hell is going on on the screen??!!"". To make this a ""different"" comedy, the director uses the style of fast-editing, experimental camera-work and the sometimes very shocking pictures, that was seen in Darren Aronofsky's drug-masterpiece ""Requiem For A Dream"" (2000). But the problem is that it's being over-used.
I want to use a little comparison to the British film ""Human Traffic"" (1999). When I saw ""Human..."" I felt like the film was trying as hard as it could, to be like Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" (1996). It failed miserably, and in the end I thought it was a bad movie. Now, when I watched ""Spun"" I felt like it was trying to do the same thing with ""Requiem..."". It didn't fail the same way as ""Human..."" though, but it is not even close to being comparable with ""Requiem For A Dream"". However, ""Spun"" makes it up with all the humor, and the fact that it is more of the ""mindless fun"" kind of comedy, that ""Human Traffic"" wasn't. But as I mentioned earlier, I think the style of the film (which was perfectly used in ""Requiem For A Dream"") is over-used, and became trying as the film approached it's climax. Therefor, I doubt I will be watching it from beginning to end, one more time.
Overall, ""Spun"" was a VERY funny comedy, driven by it's well-created characters, to me. This is not humor that fits everyone though, and there will probably be someone (as always) that'll say that it's glorifying the use of drugs. I will recommend it though, if you want to take a trip to the miserable world of drugs, trough a different comedy",1090108800,6,3725,4.714723926380368
1506025,2,B00005JM23,"The only thing I liked about this film was Mickey Rourke's performance. Other than that, there really wasn't anything at all I liked about it. The movie is very odd, which is usually a good thing, but really has nothing to accompany this oddness with. The whole 'the day in the life of a druggy' thing is really overdone, and this film does nothing to offer any originally to this 'genre' whatsoever. And I saw nothing 'innovated' nor 'awe-inspiring' about the visuals either. Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream are far, FAR superior films which deal with the same subject matter as this one does; only they do it incredibly well. Spun is full of talented actors and they're all pretty good. Acting is not this film's weak spot, but Rourke is the only one who really does anything to elevate this film at all. The others just sort of blend in accordingly. Billy Corgan does much of the music for this movie: I liked the Smashing Pumpkins and all, but Billy's newer stuff really doesn't do a whole lot for me, much like the rest of this film. I don't recommend this movie, but if by chance you do want to give it a look... I suggest you get a little 'spun' yourself first :).",1089072000,,1177,4.453703703703703
1506026,3,B00005JM23,"""Spun"" follows the three days of one name ""Ross"" (Jason Schwartzman) who always needs some chemical substance, and has no will of his own.  But ""Spun"" is free from violence, typical image associated with this kind of anti-hero; instead, it features the incredibly explicit sexual matters that would either disgust or enetrtain you, and a very realistic portrait of the guy who is leading an aimless life.
And like his aimless life, ""Spun"" at first seems going on without particular sense of story.  But to be fair, it has several funny moments, mainly coming from Leguizamo and Rourke, both something to do with sexual things.  In fact, the film gets better as it goes on, especially after the plot about the police and its documentary is introduced.  The police raid scene shot in the mock police docu-style is not to be missed.
The film virtually about Ross, who works for a drug dealer (and maker) ""The Cook"" played by Mickey Rourke.  Around them you see many strange people, some on drug, all seemingly unemployed but do not care about it.  They all have some unique personality, as the unique cast represent -- see the following list as ...
John Leguizamo as ""Spider"" in leather pants; Mena Suvari as ""Cookie,"" his love (with one scene that could be career killing in bathroom); Britney Murphey as ""Nikki"" living with ""The Cook"" (and she really loves her green-painted dog); Patrick Fugit as incredibly gross-out ""Frisbee"" directly coming from the ""Pink Flanmingo"" family; Deborah Harry as ""Lesbian Neighbor"" and Eric Roberts as ""The Man""
Also, you see the faces like Larry Drake, Charlotte Ayanna, Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette, the last two being ""The Cops.""
Swedish director Jonas Akerlund, famous for his numerous music videos, brings all of his techniques into this film, in which few things happen.  Overflowing light and slanted camera angles with a fast cutting work at first, but gradually get tedious.  Still, the music is good, handled by Billy Corgan (himself briefly seen as ""The Doctor"").
Quite unusual film, even including animation sections, ""Spun"" is so good at showing the aimless life of junkies that you might hate it because of the honesty.  But the fact remains that some of the parts are truly hilarious, and Mickey Rourke (and his biceps) is quite impressive.",1088640000,7,2293,4.950520833333333
1506027,4,B00005JM23,"Spun is the trials and tribulations, the successes and failures, (more failures) of an interesting group of loosely tied together meth users operating in urbanized America.
Its quite a peanut gallery of characters. You have the cowboy pornaholic drug producer, the wacky offbeat absent minded distributor, and their customers. They feature a bumbling acne ridden video gamer, a lost stripper, a gum chewing rotten toothed girlfriend, and a former straight edged society darling college dropout, who ties the characters together with the luxury that is an automobile.
What develops is a few days of life on meth. Characters each go through their highs and lows, and all hope to make the best of their current situations. The stripper, Nikki, and the college guy, Ross, seem to have more realistic short term goals they are striving for, as well, like Nikki seeing her child and Ross giving it another try with his old girlfriend.
As shown with the brilliantly made films Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream, you're not going to have much success in life staying on drugs. Your health can decrease, friends come and go, meth labs have a tendency to be flammable, and you might get caught, even if the cops themselves are two druggies out to bust folks for publicity.
You can probably imagine what happens to our good ol group here.
Now, with that said, at the conclusion of the film, I still wasn't sure what I was expected to think. After seeing Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream, I figured Id have a powerful, moving film about the dangers of drugs. I did, but I didn't feel much compassion towards the characters.
Then again, I don't think I was supposed to. The film seemed more of a stylish ""night on the town with meth"" episode, complete with the dizzy moments, silent spells, and hallucinations, as well as plenty of shady characters and severe time lapses. The end offered an attempt to be sentimental, but it really didn't work too well. A lot of things I found humorous, very satirical, and just plain odd. The acting wasn't bad, nothing special, but nothing to grind your teeth over either. John Leguizamo as Spider was probably my favorite performace, as he was uncontrollably buzzing like a mosquito lamp hanging near a swamp at dusk. I hadnt seen Mickey Rourke in years so that was welcome, too. Some cool and amusing cameos were present, as well, like Deborah Harry, Eric Roberts, and Billy Corgan.
Speaking of Billy Corgan, I hear some were turned off by his moody, acoustic soundtrack pieces, but I for one thought they were incredible. Id have to say the music is one of the best features of the film, and were a perfect hazy compliment to Ross's driving while high.
I think Requiem for a Dream is a far superior film in nearly every aspect over Spun, but now that I realize this film was more or less an oddly humorous angle of the same subject, I found it worth my time.",1088380800,6,2894,4.710059171597633
1506028,2,B00005JM23,"You may want to keep a Bromo Seltzer handy while watching ""Spun,"" a dizzying paean to drug pushers and drug addicts that looks and plays like a Baz Luhrmann production on speed.  (...) This might have been effective if the script had any real, discernible sense of humor.  Instead, the movie relies heavily on  distorted close ups, frantic editing, corny reaction shots, insipid double takes and goofy sound effects to achieve its laughs.  To say that it is unsuccessful in this area would be a masterpiece of understatement.  The film is scarcely more successful when it turns all sentimental in the end - like one of those John Steinbeck stories about lovable losers and romanticized social outcasts, only in this case they're all hopped up on uppers.
The cast includes such ""name"" players as Jason Schwartzman, Mickey Rourke, John Leguizamo, Deborah Harry, Eric Roberts and even porn legend Ron Jeremy, who makes a literally one shot cameo appearance as a sex club bartender.  They all deserve better.  Come to think of it, so do we.
""Spun"" may deserve points for trying to do something a bit different and innovative, but one would probably have to be a methamphetamine addict oneself to really enjoy it.",1088208000,5,1208,4.892156862745098
1506029,5,B00005JM23,"Okay, first off, please do not listen to all the pretentious reviewers who turn their nose up at ""Spun"", constantly repeating ""Requiem for a Dream"" in a pathetic, unoriginal mantra.  This movie is highly imaginative, enthralling, and kept my interest the entire time.  A friend of mine had it on video and said I should see it, so I had no expectations...and I was surprised to find it one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen.
Again, regardless of what other negative reviewers have said, there is a plot line to the movie - watching the actions and events surrounding a group of speed freaks on a meth binge.  It isn't pretty, it isn't insightful, and that's the point of the movie itself.
Though the running theme is a bit dark and depressing (but alas presented a very humorous light), the characters are beautifully pathetic.  Everyone was fabulous - Mickey Rourke, Brittany Murphy, Jason Schwartzman, everyone!  My personal favourite was Patrick Fugit's portrayal of the loser Frisbee and his spastic tendancies (someone I haven't seen mentioned enough!).  And, yet again, in contradiction to other reviewers, there is some character development; we discover the reason why our main characters are what they are, and in full honesty, there isn't much else to the character to know.  All they have are their roots and their craving for another hit.  The point of the movie was to show the disillusionment that lead to their lifestyle, the disillusionment they had concerning their drug habit...as Jason Schwartman says near the end, ""..and the greatest thing about it is, I'm not hooked!""
Not only is the story well done, but the stylistic elements were superb.  The quick actions, the animations thrown in at just the right moments, even the lighting in every scene was perfect!  The director uses a variety of techniques to add humor and a bit of insight into what the characters are experiencing.  Everytime I've seen this film, at the end I feel a bit dizzy and overwhelmed - it effects you that heavily.
I'm not one to go off and buy DVDs all the time.  I only buy them if I know it's a movie I want to watch over and over again.  ""Spun"" has joined that category of rarities that I enjoy watching constantly.  As others have mentioned, it's not for the light at heart, or those looking for a serious look at drug addiction.  It's not out to show the deep loving side of methheads, but the mindless lives they end up leading because of their out of control habits.

1506030,4,B00005JM23,"There have been many movies made in the past decade regarding drugs, mostly pot a la Dazed and Confused or Cocaine such as Traffic, even heroin like Trainspotting. This is the first film I am aware of that takes an unflinching journey into the not so wondrous world of Crystal Meth. Jason Swartzman, Mickey Roarke Mena Surveni, Brittany Murphy and John Leguizemo play a group of slackers whose main goal seems to concern getting high.
Each of them portrays colorful characters who somewhere around the way got hooked on drugs. Roarke being the ""Cook"" even has a mobile labratory he sets up in motels.
The direction of this movie while artistic is not exactly conventional. In other words this movie is bound to be disappointing to many seeking another ""Traffic"" or ""Blow"".
The best parts in my opinion are when we see into the head of Swartzman after he takes a hit, perhaps the director was intentionally making a trippy movie counterbalancing the central message which would be drugs are not glamerous or maybe he just had fun experimenting with the subject matter and the camera lens to present a visual souffle of artistic angles and shots.

There's no plot and it's a hugely derivitive movie that rips off everything from Requiem for a Dream (and other drug movies) to Beastie Boys videos.
I'm not sure what it was really trying to say about drug addiction, apart from the fact that you can pick up strippers if you take speed. Watch Trainspotting or Requiem for a more mature and informed attitude to drug addiction.
The only thing the film had going for it was that there's alot of energy so the time did pass pretty quickly. If you spend your time in front of eMpTV then this is the film for you whilst you wait for the next masterpiece from Eamon.

1506033,4,B00005JM23,"If you want to see the greatest drug movie known to man with the greatest plot on earth, don't see this. I think people who give this movie low ratings expected too much. It's a comedy about drugs. That's what the plan was from the begining. Those of us who've been keeping track of this movie knew that.
The NR version is a little harder to swallow than the R rated version, but what would you expect? There's a lot of sex and swearing, but again, what do you expect? It's a drug movie. The NR movie is better, not question, but if you really think you'd have trouble seeing it, see the R rated one.
It was a fairly disturbing movie with a twisted sense of humor. If you're into that type of thing, this movie is definitly for you.
It's not a great movie, and no one here's going to deny that. However, it's entertaining. I give this a rating of 4 Stars because it was better than I expected it to be. I saw it for one reason and one reason alone: Billy Corgan. Yeah, that's right, I'm another Smashing Pumpkins\Zwan fan who went to see this for Billy's camio and music. The music was excellent, it was all acoustic, which set a nice mood.
However, I was pleased to find out that I would've enjoyed the movie with or without his music. It's funny and interesting. The camera work was quite good, and it had a nice artistic edge to it.
To sum up, if you want to watch a movie that is not at all a family movie, but has a twisted sense of humor with a disturbing plot, get the movie. If you want a fabulous movie with incredable characters and the greatest plot under the sun, go see something else.",1081296000,3,1598,4.208469055374593

I'll be brutally honest: This movie is not a great movie, probably not even a good movie. It will never win any awards, and there are movies out there better representations of what drug addiction is like, such as Trainspotting. So if a great movie with a great representation of drugs and a wonderful plot is what you're looking for, rent something else.
However, it is fun to watch. Perhaps the R rated version may be easier for most people to swallow than the NR version. (...)
I give this movie a four because when I first decided to watch it, it was as a Smashing Pumpkins\Zwan fan wanting to see Billy Corgan's cameo and hear his music, but when I finally saw it, I almost forgot about Billy because I was too busy enjoying the movies. I was impressed with the cast- Mickey Rourke, of course, was great. Yeah, real shocker, Mickey Rourke getting high and sleeping with a 25 year old. Did he have to act at all? Just kidding. Regardless, he was definitly the best part of the movie.

Brittany Murphy has outdone herself, and all of the fine cast have demonstrated great range and courage by tackling this material.  Former music-video-director Jonas kerlund brings exactly the right touch to a movie about meth freaks, and his twitchy, rapid-cut style pulls the viewer into the feeling of runaway speed.

Jonas Akerlund, who has directed music videos such as Madonna's ""Ray of Light"", makes his film debut with this drug movie. He does a pretty good job of creating a crazy drug indused world and his casting for the most part is also suprisingly good. Most impressive was Brittany Murphy who does a great job in this movie. Mickey Rourke, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Roberts, Patrick Fugit and John Leguizamo are also very good. However Mena Suvari is nothing short of awful. But the part that I enjoyed the most was the music. Billy Corgan contributed several new songs that create an eery, sad and beautiful world that these characters inhabit. Akerlund uses many of the cliched techniques to bring the audience into this world of crystal meth, that have been used many times before, like quick cutting. However he also uses many techniques that are clearly his own and that actually resemble the ""Ray of Light"" video. Overall this is certainly worth giving a chance if you like drug films.

I also saw ""Requiem for a Dream"" and although it was a bit disturbing - was definitely a great film worth watching. I won't give any details - it's been a while since I've seen it - but it had a good story, plot and character development. In Requiem, the characters and plot were actually going somewhere. In Spun the story was putting myself and I imagine most of the people who have seen it asleep.
The people who say Spun is a Requiem wannabe are exactly right. Picture an MTV music video director trying his hardest to string together a pointless group of scenes together and this is what you'll get. The movie held my attention for about the first fifteen minutes.  There were a couple of funny scenes - but I think some of the reviewers that gave this film good reviews must have been high themselves when they were watching the movie. You gotta be able to care about at least one of the main characters in your film. Ross (Schwartzman) was a love lost loser. The actors for the most part are good actors - Schwartzman, Brittney Murphy, John Leguizamo. I've loved them in other movies they were in. Blame the screenwriter and director. Who know why actors of such high calibre would agree to be in such a piece of garbage - maybe they owed the director a favor?

But the only real similarity was the vision of drugs and how they send a life on a downward course.  SPUN is just an engaging film with lots of humor, likeable characters, and some really messed up *@@! happening to them all.
To truly apreciate the actors you must also see- RUSHMORE and ALMOST FAMOUS. Jason Schwartsman is a totaly different nerd in Rushmore, and Patrick Fuquit was the likeable star in Almost Famous.  Both of these guys play extremely different but likable parts in this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised and am now big fans of both of these actors.
BILLY CORGAN does the music, and its great.  I just need the soundtrack-which doesnt exist.  Corgan also has a small appearance in the movie.  Hes wearing a big yellow wig.
Get the unrated version- it has lots of nudity of one especially hot blond.  Britney Murphy was really hot in this movie too, even though she is supposedly a junkie.  she has a dance scene at a strip club, but no nudity of course.

I rented this ""rated"" version from a local major video chain, and was just absolutely appalled ..... it should be called ""the censored version"".  I loved the premise of the film, the visual style and the characters were a riot.  But the bleeping (that's right, BLEEPING) of profanity and the blurring out of anatomical areas (including buttocks cleavage, of all things) made me feel like I was watching badly edited reality television.  I couldn't even finish watching it; this approach to editing was much more offensive than any depicted subject matter could be.
If I were the filmmaker, I would be outraged at this inept cinematic butchery.  Maybe this was a subtle ploy to get people to buy the uncut version.  What little I saw made it seem worth having ..... then will come the positive review.  I mean, this is a movie about speed freaks, it's not meant to be a pretty thing!  Why even attempt to water it down?  Releasing movies in a manner like this is plain insulting to the discretion of the individual viewer.

If you know that this film is directed by someone previously know for directing music videos, you will be slightly less surprised by this spectacle, for many scenes have a very music video like quality.  I never would have thought this would work for a movie, but if it ever did, it would work on a drug movie.  Shocking, that there's a connection to be made between musicians and drugs...
This movie is truly visionary.  Every scene is gorgeously directed, some featuring animation, purposely campy special effects, fast motion, or random sound samples.  It really is the kind of thing one really can't describe.  Just know, it REALLY feels like you're spun too.
Each character is played to a tee, without exception.  Brittney Murphy is surprising convincing, as is Mena Suvari.  John Leguizamo is hilariously tragic, Mickey Rourke is great, particularly toward the end, and Jason Schwartzman, who is probably the weakest of the characters, is still excellent.  The only problem with all the characters in general is that they really don't seem to exist on this earth.  They have no past and no significance.
This acts as both a strength and a weakness of the film.  It's a strength because it really brings you into the mind of a speed freak; no future, no past, barely even a present.  It acts as a weakness because instead if it being a hard-hitting look at drugs in society, it's a little too easy to detach from.  It doesn't leave you with the right impression.  Instead of making you really think about drugs, it leaves you instead with ""what a gritty, visual piece,"" and once you've said that, you can easily forget about it.
The music was provided by ZWAN's Billy Corgan.  At first I was happy to see his name in the opening credits, wondering what some solo material might sound like.  While I liked the music itself, it added a fairly inappropriate tone to the film.  If the director did mean for this to be a somewhat light piece, why did they add music that sounds so soulful and thought-provoking?  It makes it seem like the director was trying for something, and that he failed miserably.  I get why one would nab Billy Corgan to do music for this though.  I'd expect they were looking more for material like ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" or ever ""Ava Adore""; something a little rougher, a little more Smashing Pumpkins and less ZWAN, which in my opinion would have been much better.

1506269,5,B00005JM23,"A wide-awakeup call, in fact. About five days worth. That's the amount of 24 hour cycles, Ross, the central character spins through in this relentless movie. Yes, this film is derivative. Shades of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (the animation sequences, especially), David Lynch's Lost Highway (a repeated shot of the dark, empty highway ahead, illuminated only by the car's headlights), D.J. Caruso's The Salton Sea (also about tweakers, with Mickey Rourke here substituting for Vincent D'Onofrio as Mr. Space Cowboy, menace 2 society, honkeytonk hairtrigger), and Darren Aranofsky's cutting-edge, Requiem for a Dream (similar downward spiralling of characters and not too dissimilar an ending).
So why the five stars, you ask? Because this film, while borrowing heavily from its sources, is still entirely original and innovative. Swedish born director, Jonas Akerlund has taken his music video sensibility and ""tweaked"" it to an extreme, combining visual and aural sensations in entirely novel ways. The camera work must be seen to be believed. Reviewers who denigrate the script are missing the point. This movie is about the camera. This is not herky-jerky, cinema verite, hand held camera work we're talking about here. This is carefully story-boarded, minutely crafted creativity at play. There are shots that could only have occured to a director who is either as crazy as his characters are (or as drug addled) or to someone possessing something along the lines of cinematic genius. Maybe it's a combination of all these. As this is Akerlund's first foray into feature films, I guess we'll just have to wait for his next movie (Lords of Dogtown, in pre-production) to decide. Don't worry yourselves about from whom, or from what, Akerlund is borrowing. Real artists worth their salt openly acknowledge that they're only building on the works of those who have come before them. I have a sneaking suspicion that Akerlund might be an artist to reckon with in the future.

Our story has characters thrown seemingly into a plotless world where things are spinning, movement is fast, and many times you find yourself asking, where am i? and what is going on? But the fast, almost storyless pace of this movie works for one reason: The drug is speed. This is the world of speed.

1506275,4,B00005JM23,"I was worried that this movie would be too similar to Requiem For A Dream, so what would be the point of watching it? I was glad I did. It kept me very interested throughout. Some of the style is similar, with the parts where they are actually taking the drugs. The camera shows you what they must be going through, eyes dialated, figures shaking, similar to how you would ""view"" a broken record. The acting is very good, and I was drawn to it, because of the group of good actors that are in it.
Basically, the character of Ross is played by Jason Schwartzmann, and he gets hooked up with a couple of drug dealers. He is the one with a car, so he gets stuck driving Nikki (Britney Murphy) around, and running errands for Cook, (Mickey Rourke) her boyfriend. All the while, he is trying to get a hold of his girlfriend, Amy, trying to tell her that he is changed, he doesn't do drugs anymore, all the while, snorting meth.
All of the characters wander around in a drug-induced haze, but it can be amusing, showing things that probably wouldn't happen if you were sober. Example: Ross ties up his sometime-girlfriend, and leaves her there while going to run errands. He puts tape over her mouth and eyes, and plays a song on repeat, but as he leaves, the CD is skipping. I would be delirious after 3-4 days of that!
All in all, it was entertaining and stressful to watch. I think that Requiem was a lot more depressing, but that is an excellent movie, and better than this one. I do recommend this one though, it has it's moments. Watch it, if not only for the performances, or seeing Mena Suvari with less than perfect teeth.",1059782400,2,1625,4.3841059602649
1506276,3,B00005JM23,"""Spun"" is an insane and quick paced film diving into the world of a handful of people hooked on Meth. And that's pretty much the plot. There's a lot to like about this movie...and there's a lot not to as well. The film is very reminiscent of ""Requiem for a Dream"" and the director certainly borrowed quite a few of the camera angles and tricks from that film. And while this movie doesn't exactly surpass that of ""Requiem,"" in my opinion, it comes pretty close.
The only real problem I find in this movie is that the story doesn't exist. There's no character development, and no history of why these people are in this situation. Also - no real direction or suspense of where they are going. It is just kind of, a week in the life of...sort of thing. However, there are a lot of positive things in the film as well. The acting is quite good, especially that of Mickey Rourke and John Leguizamo (who I don't normally like that much - but liked in this movie a lot) - the girls did a good enough job with Brittany Murphy leading the pack.
The directing in the movie was very, shall we say, experimental or ""artsy"" and while I like that to an extent, I felt it was a little abused here making it, not so shocking or provocative after 30 minutes or so. Also - I wasn't too fond of the ending of the movie. I thought it was lacking proper closure.
Regardless, this is an entertaining little movie that I picked up on a whim at my local blockbuster. The acting is good and the visuals are entertaining. However, if you're looking for an academy award winning storyline - look elsewhere. A good way to kill a couple hours. I would recommend renting it first to make sure it's your bag.
I liked ""Requiem for a Dream"" a little better, mainly because of the storyline and character development was more in depth. So I give ""Spun"" 3/5 stars - while ""Requiem"" gets 4/5.",1059782400,,1857,4.354466858789626

The plot primarily follows the twisted day(s) of druggy Ross who mets other fellow druggies, and through this, the crystal meth system of maker->buyer->distributer is displayed.  This movie is effective in making viewers never want to touch crystal meth because of the disgusting lifestyle it may lead to.
