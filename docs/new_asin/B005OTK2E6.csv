This is an excellent follow up documentary of the Bhopal gas disaster that took place in 1984. The producer's of the documentary are showing  how the second and third generation Bhopal victims and their families-if any are alive-are struggling with the tragic aftermath of a plethora of health issues, financial problems, and inability to receive much needed medical care and medicines. But the most disturbing facts the movie's producers show us are twofold; the survivors living in Bhopal do not have access to clean water; they have no other option than to use the methyl isocyanate contaminated water that must be pumped daily from the communities water sources. To add insult to injury the environmental pollution and contamination from the explosion of the tank holding the MIC has never been cleaned up by Union Carbide/Dow Chemical Corporation! The murderous factory located in Bhopal is the site of the worst industrial disaster in history and thousands of innocent lives were consumed by an invisible atrocity; sadly, future generations of Bopalis will be cursed with birth defects, cerebral palsy, blindness and a myriad of untreatable diseases and health problems. As I watched this documentary unfold, I was either crying or enraged by the lack of concern and terrible treatment of the victims- in 1984 and up to the present-2013. It would seem-from the corporate perspective-that the people of Bhopal are expendable and of no value; why bother cleaning the mess up and why give a damn about helping the sick and poor; but what really matters is the profit that was made.
