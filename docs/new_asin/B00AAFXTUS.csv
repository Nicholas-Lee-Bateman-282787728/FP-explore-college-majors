8549171,4,B00AAFXTUS,"This obscure documentary is very well-presented and stresses the importance of the preservation of historic, hand-carved carousels.  It laments the loss of so many of these treasures from an earlier age, through sheer carelessness, natural disasters, vandalism, and of course, the greed of wealthy collectors.

The video takes a brief look at the restoration process of individual figures as well as whole carousels, and interviews several notable ""caretakers"" of these functional art objects.  The only downside really, is that the video is a little short.",1417910400,,557,5.529411764705882
