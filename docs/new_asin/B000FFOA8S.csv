8121916,5,B000FFOA8S,"this is a good DVD.  you must be very open minded, to enjoy it.  it is very wild stuff on it.  to me, it seems to be done in good taste, but probably not something for every one.  I would not recomend it to the Mary Poppins but if you are open minded, this seems to be a good DVD.",1332028800,,280,3.6166666666666667
