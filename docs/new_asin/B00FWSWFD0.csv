6034361,1,B00FWSWFD0,I usually like movies like this but this was not worth the rental money. The plot was sketchy and the whole excitement factor I normally get from movies like this was just not there.,1406505600,,182,4.382352941176471
6034362,3,B00FWSWFD0,Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Okay plot and scenario could have been better thought out. Otherwise interesting movie a little more special effects would have been nice. A movie to watch when the mood to watch a entertaining move with an interesting disaster theme. I would recommend this movie.,1405641600,,308,5.0588235294117645
6034363,3,B00FWSWFD0,"The best thing about this movie is the dopey title: Stonados.
The movie involves a science teacher who spends more time trying to track down his own disobedient offspring rather than teach someone else's kids how to make a model volcano erupt.  When the first mysterious flying rock squishes a basketball player, naturally his cop sister calls him as an undisputed expert in strange phenomenon.  They're soon joined by a giddy weather dude who used to be an old friend (he spends most of the movie grinning like an idiot, as if he was in on some colossal joke we don't know about......yet).  Before you can say, here comes another one, rocks are flying everywhere, killing people in a cartoonish fashion (one minute they're chatting with someone, the next minute they're gone and you see neither the stone that took them out nor their body).  It's a civilized way of dispatching people; no fuss no muss.  Naturally, it's up to these three people to save humanity from instant killer storms that hurl stones.  They even have a theory as to why this mayhem is happening, some yappity-yappity explanation about volcano debris and frozen ozone droplets.  (The least interesting aspect of these outrageous sci-fi flicks is the wild explanations as to why any of these impossible things are happening.)  Don't care; just bring on the carnage.  Seriously, authenticity is not the reason I watch and collect these ridiculous disaster flicks.  The only prerequisite I demand is that they have to be incredibly stupid.  I live for bad movies.  This one did not disappoint.",1404432000,13,1562,4.919847328244275
6034364,5,B00FWSWFD0,Grade B movie but it was fun to watch on a Saturday afternoon,1404345600,,61,3.769230769230769
6034365,3,B00FWSWFD0,Not a.bad movie. Interesting theory as to how these stones come out of tornados. It was an okay movie. I have watched it a few times so it can't be that bad.,1397692800,7,157,3.9375
6034366,5,B00FWSWFD0,"This is a great movie to watch with friends.  Trash talk the movie, throw some popcorn and get ready to laugh.  Some of the acting is achingly bad, the special effects not always special, and the plot is tread bare ... which is why we loved it.

Sometimes I get tired of watching movies so intensely real that you feel as if you'll need PTSD drugs and therapy for having watched it!  (Did anyone else have trouble watching Dredd? All that blood, in slow motion ... YIKES!!!)

The thing about these types of movies, is that EVERYONE knows it's fake, and the odds are against anything like this ever happening in the real world.  Thank God.  With earthquakes, acid rain, global warming and Fukushima Daiichi radiation to worry about ... I could use some comic relief!",1396915200,13,765,4.580882352941177
6034367,3,B00FWSWFD0,It was ok for what I wanted. No issues with acting and there were good points. Average movie. Go ahead and rent.,1394668800,5,112,4.136363636363637
6034368,1,B00FWSWFD0,"A phrase coined by a weatherman for a phenomenon of rampant waterspouts throwing exploding rocks at the public. The acting was wooden and shallow, the characters aimless, the plot nonexistant and spoiler...the ending happy despite the number of friends and aquaintances who were destroyed right in front of their eyes. What rubbish!",1391385600,2,332,5.403846153846154
6034369,3,B00FWSWFD0,I like the actors the were convincing enough! The Plymouth Rock was a touch too much! But all in all storyline was some what believable! Exploding rocks due atmospheric anomalies due to the changes in the ozone along with sea bed volcano eruptions changing the low atmosphere was something I don't quite grasp but ok. It was entertaining still.,1391299200,11,344,4.8474576271186445
6034370,2,B00FWSWFD0,"Pretty bad, one of those cranked out Sci Fi movies, a dime a dozen. Sharknado was better, slightly.",1448064000,,99,4.555555555555555
6034371,3,B00FWSWFD0,It was not the best movie but it was still interesting to watch.,1444348800,,64,4.0
6034372,5,B00FWSWFD0,The greatest bad classic since Plan 9!! Get some friends together a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy!!!,1444003200,,100,4.611111111111111
6034373,2,B00FWSWFD0,Poor effects.,1442620800,,13,6.0

6034375,1,B00FWSWFD0,"Just okay. This is just what you'd expect, a storm of stones!",1437436800,,61,4.166666666666667
6034376,1,B00FWSWFD0,I love low grade disaster movies. From the Japanese goofy to the absolutely impossible to fathom with even zero common sense types. This one exceeds stupid that even fun jabs about the bad acting and poor graphics can't help make it entertaining. Ther are thousands of these films out so skipping this one will not hurt your library of available disaster flicks :-),1437177600,,365,4.809523809523809
6034377,4,B00FWSWFD0,"It was everything I expected it to be: bad acting, funky CGI, bizarre story line. I couldn't have been more pleased!",1437004800,,116,4.571428571428571
6034378,4,B00FWSWFD0,"l liked this also bit different but still kept you on edge
worth a watch",1436659200,,72,3.8666666666666667
6034379,5,B00FWSWFD0,I like movies like this. Just a little crazy but good show,1431302400,,58,3.9166666666666665
6034380,1,B00FWSWFD0,Just hard to watch!,1429488000,,19,4.0
6034381,5,B00FWSWFD0,I was really surprise by this movie when I saw the trailer. After seeing Sharknado I was intrigued by what Stonados would have to offer and it did not disappoint. Keep it up with this kind of imagination. Great movie.,1429401600,,217,4.45
6034382,5,B00FWSWFD0,Well this movie had me seating on the edge of my seat. Bravo bravo,1429228800,,66,3.7857142857142856
6034383,5,B00FWSWFD0,"I may have a warped sense of humour, but I thought some of the ways the characters died were funny.",1429056000,,99,4.0
6034384,5,B00FWSWFD0,"if you like this kind of movie, it is a must buy for your collection",1425600000,,68,3.6
6034385,4,B00FWSWFD0,This movie - so ridiculously good!!  Who knew Plymouth Rock was really a gigantic boulder that could keep wreaking havoc time after time in apparently the exact same tornado??  Mediocre acting coupled with really pretty good special effects makes the movie pass quickly even though it's the same standard tornado disaster plot - they appear - they disperse their damage - the disappear - all said and done - it's worth it!!,1424908800,2,423,4.861111111111111
6034386,3,B00FWSWFD0,this movie was better then sharkado. maybe next they will make snakeado or better yet crocodilado,1422230400,,97,5.125
6034387,5,B00FWSWFD0,Silly sounding name but apropos once one starts watching it.  It's a fun disaster movie.,1421020800,,88,4.866666666666666
6034388,5,B00FWSWFD0,"Clever idea.  I didn't feel so ""boxed in"" unlike other disaster movies with sets that look like garages, and towns with just two stores, one house and a gas station that blows up.  No, this opened up the action with large scenes of interesting buildings and actual crowds of people. The special effects served enough to get the message across and the cast kept things going, with thoughtful performances.",1420761600,,404,4.840579710144928
6034389,1,B00FWSWFD0,Boring movie. Alful script,1420588800,,26,5.75
6034390,3,B00FWSWFD0,Would have given it a 5 star rating had they not shown Pittsburgh's Heinz Field. Were they too cheap to use Gillette Stadium?,1420156800,,125,4.478260869565218

6034395,5,B00FWSWFD0,"I say this again I am a weather girl so watching tornado movies are my favorite things to do. Sure this movie has some unrealistic situations but if you like tornadoes then this movie is for you. It is all in what you like. But for me, I loved seeing the water sprouts.",1417132800,,269,4.09433962264151

6034399,5,B00FWSWFD0,Plymouth Rock is sucked up by a waterspout and thrown some 40 miles away and lands on a guy playing basketball.  Two buddies that were storm chasers in college get together to find out why.  Good plot and story and good acting.  I liked it.,1407715200,2,240,4.288888888888889
8618954,5,B00FWSWFD0,I just love this movie. It shows how a volcano can affect nature in a way that is rarely seen. I highly recommend this seller to anyone.,1521936000,,136,4.074074074074074
