2614266,5,B000GIXLX4,"This is a great 3 parter first shown in Britain in April 2006.  An adaptation of the fantastic novel The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst, the television drama stays very faithful to the book.  It really encapsulates what it was to live in Britain in the 1980s, albeit a fairly rich circle.  Dan Stevens does an amazing job in his portrayal of Nick Guest.  This DVD is not to be misssed.",1154390400,35,390,4.375
2614267,5,B000GIXLX4,"Again, I love to watch Dan Stevens.  He has such beautiful eyes.  This movie was heartbreaking in that these people loved to have him as their friend and they seemed close until it was no longer convenient for them.  He pays a convincing naive young man quite well and you can see the hurt on his face over their rejection of him which had more to do with his being gay than the lame excuses they came up with.  I think the moral of the story was that family, no matter how unaccomplished you might think they are, are really the ones who care about you.",1420156800,5,554,4.19811320754717

2614269,3,B000GIXLX4,"Although beautifully filmed in England, I found the story to be very dark and deep.  Dan Stevens and the other actors play their parts well in this tale of homosexuality and the treatment of such in the world of wealth, power and political ambition, all occuring during the time of Margaret Thatcher's Britian.  The movie is definitely not for family watching.",1395532800,,360,4.885245901639344
2614270,4,B000GIXLX4,Terrific acting by British leading actors. Sad but realistic protrayal of the 80's gay aids scene. Having worked in theatre in the late 80's with actors and production crews when the gays I worked with were unaware of the full effects of the aids epidemic and then see many die in the 90's this movie shows the reality of those times in a compassionate and artistic way.,1389225600,,370,4.537313432835821
2614271,5,B000GIXLX4,"Dan Stevens is luminous in this lengthy three part and very faithful adaption of the book that won a Man Booker prize, playing Nick Guest, the gay middle class Oxford grad who goes in search of love and beauty along the Tory set in Thatcher's London.  Kudos must be given to Tim McInnerny who could not be better in the role of the pompous and somewhat false Tory MP Gerald Fedden.  And Alice Krige also gives a touching portrayal of Rachel Fedden.  Friend of son Toby, Nick comes to stay as a vacation house minder in the Fedden's magnificent Kensington Park Gardens mansion. In addition to minding the house, Nick is also to keep an eye on volatile daughter Catherine (the Cat) a cutter who walks a manic-depressive line.

Having done well over the vacation, Nick is invited to lodge there while pursuing his doctoral degree at UCL, to serve as a buffer between Cat and her parents, and as a filial substitute and general dogsbody and syncophant to the egotistical Fedden.  In this, he's a little false. While he's in love with their lifestyle, he's also critical of it, seeming to secretly sympathise and long to be Tory when with Gerald and his friends, and with Labor when with more middle class associates. He's a lodger, who pays a little rent and lives in a tiny attic room, but is included in the parties and lifestyle of the rich Feddens.

In the film, Stevens does a far better job of making the viewer like his character than the book does, giving him a naive, gushing, longing portrayal, making the most of his blue eyes and tousled locks.  It's just as well he does and that the film can't replicate the internal dialogue in the book, where Guest will give a spoken compliment and mentally take it back. It makes the viewer sympathize and like his character far better than it deserves. making him a little less of a leech, and makes the ending a bit more shocking.

While living with the family,ostensibly pursuing his degree, Guest's primary mission is to find love, or failing that, sex.  He goes about this in a clueless and not terribly competent way. With all Guest's physical charms and Oxford accomplishments, he can't seem to develop an honest relationship.  The same issues that drive him to lodge with the Tory Feddens cause him to latch onto millionaire Wani Ouradi, a beautiful closeted and gay fellow Oxford grad, who takes Nick on as am employee and sometime lover. But Wani is more interested in coke, porn and sex than his business, and regards Nick more as just another bought and paid for syncophant than lover, employee or equal. And the specter of Aids begins to haunt the gay community.

Catherine flies from depression to mania, and when manic, babbles secrets that were best kept hidden. Nick the outsider is an easy scapegoat for the troubles she creates,partly because he was her ""minder"" partly because he's suspected of telling one of Gerald's secrets that she discerned on her own. And Nick's tentative house of cards, that depended not upon real regard, but upon at least partly false relationships between all these people, begins to fall.

One difference between the book and the film -- the film also makes Nick's ultimate fate more optimistic, if still open-ended. It also offers a final scene with Catherine that wasn't in the book, but should have been.

This film has wonderful performances, beautiful settings and an allegedly faithful representation of Tory London and the fallout of AIDS on the gay community in the 80s. The problem (and it is the same in the book, if less so), is that Nick Guest isn't, and was never meant to be an entirely likable character, and his fate is left very open ended.  But while the characters aren't entirely likable, they are well drawn enough to be unforgettable, and it is a mini-series worth seeing.",1383350400,,3790,4.705438066465256
2614272,3,B000GIXLX4,"Have to admit, I only bought this because I loved Dan Stevens as Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey.  Hard to believe he's only 23-24 years-old in it, because he looks mid-30s.  This mini-series moves very slowly and there are some graphic gay sex scenes.  The story could have been good if they cut out A LOT and focused on his ex-lover dying of AIDS.  They should have explored that more.  Meh.",1376438400,,394,4.492957746478873
2614273,4,B000GIXLX4,It was great fun too see something set in the 80's and the film followers the line out of the book very well.  Only think that I was a bit annoyed about was that it came with a coding only allowing me to watch it on my computer,1376092800,,227,3.7291666666666665
2614274,5,B000GIXLX4,"This film is true to the eponymous novel by Alan Hollinghurst, well cast and expensively produced.

2614275,4,B000GIXLX4,"The story was extremely unusual, but early on got your attention.  Dan Stevens was incredibly good in this film. It is fairly graphic, so you need to be aware of that. He plays a gay man who enjoys living with his college roommate's family in a very posh area.  He becomes very close to his roommate's sister and the problems begin at that moment. The ending certainly makes sense after all the intrigue involving British politics, but you are left wondering about the health condition of the man Stevens' plays..........would definitely recommend if you like great acting and surprise endings.",1363219200,,594,4.93
2614276,5,B000GIXLX4,"Twenty-three year old Dan Stevens was excellent in The Line of Beauty.  He was almost in every frame of the film, and he gave a sensitive performance.  His was not an easy role to play, a gay man in a still homophobic world.  Above all he was believable. The film is faithful to Alan Hollinghurst's beautifully written novel.  I most high recommend both.  As to Stevens, he is now known all over the world for his performance in Downton Abbey.  I hope he will always be proud of his role in The Line of Beauty, for it is truly one of hte best films addressing gay life during the times of Margaret Thatcher when AIDS was mostly ignored by both American (under Reagan) and British politicians.",1360195200,2,692,4.4523809523809526
2614277,5,B000GIXLX4,The story of a middle class gay man in 1980's Britain who becomes embroiled in the affluent lifestyle of the aristocratic English.  The main thrust of the movie is definitely geared to gay men but it is a totally entertaining story regardless of your preferences.  Filled with many subplots and beautiful guys.  I saw this entire series on BBC and loved it so much that I ordered my own copy on dvd.  Take this opportunity to enjoy a great miniseries which you may have never heard of.  Because it may be obscure does not diminish its entertainment value!,1356739200,2,555,4.622448979591836
2614278,4,B000GIXLX4,"Well crafted BBC drama series faithfully based on a novel by Allan Hollinghurst. The story involves Nick Guest , a middle class good looking student who becomes a long term guest or lodger to the enormously wealthy Feddens family. The father of the family is a Tory MP during the greedy cut-throat times of Thatcherism , the mother is a don't-rock-the-boat lady who pretends everything is kept under perfect English civility, the son is a jock with political future and the daughter is a young woman with issues and a yearning for the truth. Nobody seems to have a problem with Nick, the guest, being gay despite the fact that it is a conservative environment. Nick is a scholar in Henry James and well versed in cultural matters. He is entrusted with the care of the young unpredictable daughter and they become close friends.
  The first part of the movie focuses on Nicks' love for Leo, a black man. Leo will be the target of the first cracks in the perfect facade of the Feddens and their friends who are less shy about their racism and homophobia than the Feddens would admit. Leo and Nick's relationship abrupt end serves as an introduction to the looming AIDS crisis which becomes central to the progress of the story. As time goes by, other scandals come to the surface that endanger the political future of the head of household as well as the pretense of normalcy. Some involve a wealthy married lebanese heir, insider trading and sexual escapades. The press has a field day with all of that and Nick becomes a escape goat of sorts. The end is quite abrupt and leaves a lot of unanswered questions. That is the most unsatisfying part of this otherwise beautifully written drama. Without giving anything away, we do not know in the end if both Nick and the Faddens have learned their lessons or prefer to retreat into their cherished delusions. Another issue in this show is the wooden acting of the main character who rarely changes key in his performance even when every other actor is just phenomenal.",1266364800,,2013,4.68361581920904

This is a superb BBC series set in Margaret (""The Lady"") Thatcher's 1986-87 England amidst upper crust British political nobility and mega-rich society, and a background of decadence.

2614282,4,B000GIXLX4,"Taking Hollinghurst's brilliant novel and making a 3 hour mini-series out of it is somewhat audacious. What makes it work is the high quality of the adaptation and the fine acting and the carefully thought through details of the setting. The book was written after the Thatcher era, and this is critical to the understanding of the reader. We don't have to wonder how things worked out because history has already told us. So we can focus on the subtle reminders of where we were when certain things came along. The comparisons to James and Fitzgerald that appear in other reviews are clearly appropriate. I was moved by the inspiration of Brideshead Revisited. This novel was also subject to mini-series adaptation and the two products live in their own worlds now -- subject to different vicissitudes that give them different kinds of anachronistic feels. But this does not spoil the pleasure of those works, nor does it spoil the pleasure of The Line of Beauty.

Nick Guest is not an important literary figure because he is weirdly outside the main flow of the storyline. It might be ironic that the narrator and central character of this story is outside the flow, but this is what makes both his presence and the existence of the story possible. Guest is like a piece of pH paper reporting the acidity of the environment without creating it. The twist at the end is particularly poignant because it reverses the cause and effect and leaves the viewer somewhat unsettled about how things turn out. But I ask the viewer to consider: if you were in the shoes of Nick Guest, how would you have handled things?",1230940800,3,1610,4.729537366548043

2614285,5,B000GIXLX4,"June 24, 2008 (original review, with minor edit)

There is much to learn from UK's treatment of homosexuality in films.  The subtle detail of realism is often absent in American version of the gay cinema.  The story does not insult viewer's intelligence with some self-pity fest or wrap things up in an unbelievable Hollywood ending.

The undertone of the story is rather grim, much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breakfast-on-Pluto/dp/B000EHRVOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breakfast on Pluto</a>.  The future is viewed as bleak and hopeless.  The way it unfolds is like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maurice/dp/B00014NE62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maurice</a>, so it's not really for people with short attention span.  Fortunately, the story is divided into three episodes, and can be viewed more or less independently.  The story can sink one's heart rather deep, so be forewarned.

The main character is called Nick Guest.  Like his surname suggests, he could not find a place where he belonged.  The way I see it, he is this paradigm figure that represents every gay man.  He had fun, had made a career, while it lasted....  He thought he had love and friendship, but everything was but a grand illusion.  After that, he moved on again, with uncertainty.

The very last spoken line wrapped up everything....  When Nick decided to move on and move out of the house he had made it home for the last four years, he had a little chat with Elena,.  He amusingly recalled he had mistaken the maid as the mistress of the house.  Elena, with a smiling indifference, said something like, ""You know when you first came..., I thought to myself, you were no good.""  To me, that is the line that hurts the most; an in-your-face denial of the familial connection.

The film captures the essence of what is like to be gay very well (from a soul-searching perspective).  It's not without flaw, however.  I was quite baffled at how Nick could flip from sexually-inexperienced to someone who engaged public sex with a stranger.  He also seemed to know how to do it (from behind) at his first try....

In any case, it's a good gay film that deserves to be called a drama (and not to be mistaken as a ""drama"" ;-)).  Whole-heartily recommended, but please watch it when you're not already too depressed.

August 14, 2009 (update)

It's been a year since I first watched ""The Line of Beauty.""  The story haunted me in a heart-sinking but beautiful way.  A romantic notion, I guess.  I noticed the screen writer this time.  What a surprise, my favorite, Mr. Andrew Davies!  No wonder the treatment is so sublime and simply beautiful.  For those who aren't veterans of BBC dramas, Andrew Davies is responsible for many successes of classics novel adaptions such as 1995 version of Jane Austen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice/dp/B001E2JNA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice</a>&nbsp;(with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle), and 2005 version of Charles Dickens's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bleak-House/dp/B001P7YDA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bleak House</a>&nbsp;(with Gillian Anderson).  He seems to have a great touch to turn everything into gold (except for one, but that's only my opinion).

Anyways, here is what I think after the second screening.  The story remained more or less the same of how I remembered.  However, I found out there are more sex scenes than I first awared.  Don't know how that happened.  Maybe I was so focused on the story, my mind skipped them, despite they were rather daring acts.  Some people who reviewed the original novel mentioned they were offended by the number of sexual elements.  The original novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Line-of-Beauty/dp/1582346100/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Line of Beauty</a>&nbsp;by Alan Hollinghurst, is 2004's Booker Prize winner, by the way.

If you think my original review is a little muddy, well, I am not going to change that.  However, I do want to explain what I think about Nick's character, which many people neither understand nor could relate to (I don't remember who said it's okay for the reader not able to relate to his character, because that means the character is refreshing).  He did not suck up the family for his own benefit.  He was accused of doing so by Gerald, when his political career went kaboom.  Imagine yourself in Nick's shoes.  His position in society was grossly under that of the rest of the family.  He had to be tactful and be diplomatic.

That brings up an interesting observation.  For those who have watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Talented-Mr-Ripley/dp/0792165020/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Talented Mr. Ripley</a>, you might remember Tom Ripley did a gig as a classical pianist, but Dickie liked jazz.  Nick Guest also played a Mozart to Catherine, probably that's what he thought a grand family like hers would do, but Catherine thought it was like a funeral or something so she played some punk rock on the radio.  Subconsciously, people do that sort of things.  But some reviewers of the novel or DVD did get frustrated and called it sucking up to the high society.  If that's the case, then they are just as bad as Gerald, and totally missed the point why it was such a tragic event for Nick.

I'm going to use another example, this time with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park/dp/6305907145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park</a>.  I'm not entirely sure if it's in the novel (I'm not that far into it yet, but I am reading it), but in the movie version Fanny was caught between two worlds.  She was born in an under-privileged household, but brought up in a high-society.  She was constantly reminded that she was below everyone else in the rich household.  When she decided to retreat to her blood family, figured she would be treated as equal, but ironically everyone thought she was too grand a lady.  That's Nick.  He is a guy, obviously, but I mean it doesn't matter where he goes, he is not received properly.

So... to my fellow Americans, yes, you DO understand class system.  I had strangers decided to talk to me in big words when they were obviously not comfortable using it.  Perhaps I should be flattered that they thought of me as a grand lady (though I am neither).  The effect of education, I suppose.  ;-D  (yes, that's from Rozema's version of Mansfield Park featuring Frances O'Connor)  (*ponders a bit then laughs at his own remark*)

In the last of the three-part mini-series, you can tell Nick was genuinely absorbed into the way of this strangely dysfunctional family, which had a value very different from his own.  People do get comfortable in a place, especially when one treats it like their home already.  What did he get at the end?  These people who he spent four years, lived, laughed, endured crisis(eseseses) with, just HAD to hurt him, only because he was gay.  Mr. Nick Guest, where do you beautifully belong?",1214265600,5,7243,5.446043165467626
2614286,3,B000GIXLX4,"This British pot-boiler has one thing going for it: the young men are uniformly good looking. The older men, however, are uniformly opinionated, right-wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan/Thatcher years. Young or old, however, morals in this three-part mini-series are suspect and no one comes off particularly well.

Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford. While not pivotal to the story, he has an extraordinary head of hair which at least makes watching this drivel easier. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician. He babysits their house, and daughter Cat, while the rest of the family frolics in the south of France. They neglect to inform him that Cat, when upset, cuts herself with an assortment of kitchen implements. Nick mistakes their self-serving gratitude for affection and moves in, finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years but, as the plot depends on this point, it's best not to question it.

While Nick is pleasing to look at, he is unbearably obsequious. His coy subjugation to the rich bigots soon had this viewer climbing the walls. Deeply closeted except to Cat (she guessed his big secret on sight), he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay. Though it hardly seems possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he.

Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nick's sexual orientation, and connection to Gerald's family, is reported in a tabloid. Gerald, who has become involved in various personal and financial scandals, is further embarrassed by the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment, which gives him one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy.

Except for one brief moment of indignation, Nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement. Denial, self-hate, guilt, naivete, or ignorance? You decide.",1203465600,4,2067,5.0
2614287,4,B000GIXLX4,"This three-part, three-hour drama, based on Alan Hollinghurst's novel of the same name, has much going for it. Taking place in 3 episodes in 1983, 1986, and 1987; many themes are explored with sensitivity and insight. However, I would like to focus this review on just one aspect of the film, which is the price of privilege.

Middle-class Nick Guest (played well by handsome Dan Stevens) is attracted to his best friend Toby Fedden (played by Oliver Coleman). When they graduate from Oxford, Nick comes to visit Toby in the Fedden's beautiful grand home in West London. Soon his gracious personality and wit and handsome appearance win over the entire family, especially daughter Catherine Fedden, a self-mutilator. Gerald the father (played to perfection by Tim McInnerny) and Rachael the mother (played by Alice Krige) run off the France leaving Nick to care for the house and for Catherine (nicknamed Cat). Dissonance immediately begins since the Feddens seem much to smart, sensitive, and informed to run off to France and leave a mentally ill daughter with a virtual stranger. Catherine and Nick soon however become best of friends since Catherine is fascinated with the fact that he is gay and she seeks non-sexual intimacy with him. She also specializes in penetrating hypocrisy, almost as if hypocrisy was unbearable to her. This is a trait that makes her a social and political liability for her parents. This is also the trait that drives the multiple tragedies of this story.

What kind of fellow is Nick? He lives in fabulous surroundings in a home where the father is a conservative member of parliament yet, as his name implies, he is a guest in this rare world of privilege and he done not yet know its price or the price others pay. Nick is a student of Henry James and wishes to go to graduate school to study James. However in the meantime he begins to explore his sexuality and soon begins an affair with a handsome Jamaican man, Leo, played by Dan Gilet. This allows for more exploration of conservative hostility toward persons of color which is contrasted with Nick's erotic attraction to warm sweet Leo.  But as the story progresses, Nick goes through the maturing steps of a broken heart and then eventually becomes lovers with a multimillionaire Lebanese, Wani Ouradi, who supports Nick in a world of multiple partner sexual adventures, cocaine drug orgies, and the development of an indulgent arts magazine that appeals to the ultra-sophisticated rich. Wani is played by Alex Wyndham who maintains the erotic mysterious decadent stereotype of the gay exotic.

All of this splendor begins to crumble with the rising political success of Gerald Fedden, which requires him to associate with wealthy bigots and prejudicial hate-monger ideologues that direct the policies of the conservative party. It is daughter Cat who pulls the world down around the other characters by exposing all the hypocrisy and hidden scandal that supports the privileged life that she and her family enjoy. However her desire to reveal all hypocrisy also bleeds into the life of Nick and his lover Wani, who is dying of AIDS. Wani does stretch toward honesty and authenticity as he begins to die, offering to leave Nick the building in which they manage their arts magazine.

Having sex with men while implying to the world that you are straight may protect privilege but it makes a man vulnerable. Thus when we see Gerald fall from his political perch due to financial and sexual scandals, we also see Wani fall as he deteriorates physically from the effects of HIV. Nick looks at the first edition of their magazine Ogee and the impression is that the wealthy, privilege, glamour, and luxury is at best an illusion, and more likely a diversion from authenticity.

Nick becomes the scapegoat for the scandals that plague the Fedden home, even though his gayness was surely one of the least scandals the Fedden's faced. Yet the viewer is left with the impression that the scapegoat role allows him to make an emotional break from the Feddens and maybe one day this young man's painful experiences will afford him authenticity. The film is oddly optimistic in the end since Nick may be in both pain and grief and must start his life over, but the viewer is never in doubt that the painful lessons will be integrated into this bright sensitive young man so that the final product is stronger and more self directed.

Well made, beautifully acted, clearly formatted and edited, the film is very good and is highly recommended.",1200096000,12,4523,4.896866840731071
2614288,5,B000GIXLX4,"Fans of Alan Hollinghurst should be really pleased with this TV adaptation of his last and award-winning novel. The TV format may be difficult for some used to cinema-size productions (e.g. difficult to take at one go) but seems perfectly suited for this particular novel. The Line of Beauty develops slowly, gradually and it requires time to play itself out completely. A 90 minutes long movie would have to squeeze and cut down the plot and there is a serious danger little would be left of its original charms.
If you know and like AH novels and The Line of Beauty in particular you will not be disappointed. If you stumbled upon this DVD by chance, it may be a good introduction to some decent reading.",1199232000,2,706,4.611111111111111
2614289,4,B000GIXLX4,"Based on Alan Hollinghurst's novel by the same name that won the 2004 Booker Prize, this film, a BBC miniseries, does not stray much from the original story and complements it. Nick Guest, who is aptly named, (Dan Stevens) moves, at the urging of his straight friend from Oxford, Toby, into the lush Nottingham home of Toby's family consisting of Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny), a Tory MP in Margaret Thatcher's government; his crazed daughter Catherine; and his wife. The action takes place in 1983, 1986 and 1987. Nick meets and falls for Leo (Dan Gilet) early in the first part. Leo has disappeared in the second hour, and Nick, a Henry James scholar, has pretty much given up James for the exotic Lebanese Wani Duradi who introduces him to coke (the line of beauty) and decadent sexual encounters. Both Fedden and Nick's worlds come crashing down (""The End of the Street"") in 1987.

The film is about class and corruption. While Nick certainly has his flaws, he redeems himself, at least in part, by accepting the consequences of his actions. Catherine, a strange young woman, is the moral center of the film.

One question I had about both the film and the book: while I am not a close student of the life of Margaret Thatcher, I cannot see her shaking it up and dancing with the coked-out Nick at a party. She certainly would have been one of those celebrities who would have refused to jump for the photographer Philippe Halsman.

A film well worth watching more than once.",1178755200,3,1479,4.680769230769231
2614290,3,B000GIXLX4,"This movie was a gentle- though cynical tale of life in Thatcher's England. A young gay man ends up living with his friend's family, who are upper class and politically conservative. Most of the episodes are spent ambling through some interesting observations of the double life the main character leads- on the one hand being the people pleasing toady of the family and on the other a gay man exploring sex, drugs and the AIDS phenomenon of the 80's.

The best scene is where our hero asks Madam Thatcher [referred to as The Lady] to dance at a party and she accepts. From there on it is all down hill. The ending is really sad and gloomy, but if that doesn't bother you, it is worth a look.",1174867200,5,692,4.40625

2614293,5,B000GIXLX4,"This 3 hour, 3 part series is a fantastic adaptation of Alan Hollinghurst's prize-winnging novel. The acting is superb and the plot will keep you glued to the TV! Beautifully filmed and highly enjoyable.",1172275200,8,203,5.0
2614294,4,B000GIXLX4,"Alan Hollinghurst's brilliant novel THE LINE OF BEAUTY has been well adapted for film by Andrew Davies and brought to BBC television by director Saul Dibb and an outstanding cast. That television miniseries is now available on one DVD with each of the three parts intact as seen in the UK (not the parceled version shown in the USA) and it is a satisfying transition from Hollinghurst's visual poetry to cinematic depiction.

The story takes place from 1983 to 1987 in England - the Thatcher years - when class differences, hypocrisies, paparazzi, and homophobia were peaking.  Essentially the tour guide through this time is one Nicholas Guest (Dan Stephens), a 'middle class' son of an antiques dealer who has just finished Oxford (on scholarship) and visits the home of his wealthy roommate Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) whose father Gerald (Tim McInnerny) is climbing the steps of politics as his warmly understanding and supportive wife Rachel (Alice Krige) looks on and worries about their knotty daughter Cat (Hayley Atwill) who loathes politics and sees the hypocrisy spoken by all of her father's associates.  Nick is welcomed into the family with genuine warmth and he is smitten by the grandeur of their lifestyle and the beauty of their home: he becomes their surrogate son when Toby leaves for adventures with his shallow sweetheart, taking care of at times self-mutilating Cat.

Nicholas is gay, finds love with a lower class handsome black man Leo (Don Gilet), and shares his proclivities with Cat, his confidant.  Insidiously Nick becomes a full part of the Fedden family, serving as a son would, entertaining at parties with them, and meeting the important people whom Gerald engages in his political pyramid.  Among them is a Lebanese family whose wealthy son Wani Ouradi (Alex Wyndham) catches Nick's eye and though Wani is 'engaged' to a girl he also is a severely closeted gay man and Nick and Wani become entwined in drugs and love.  When the spectre of AIDS begins to diminish the population of England some secrets are revealed, secrets of sexual liaisons that are intolerable for the Feddens and their associates yet lead to the hypocrisy of affairs within Gerald Fedden's protected world.  It is the surfacing of the true lives of the characters that proves to be the downfall of Nicholas and his relationship to the world of wealth as well as the crumbling of the fragile political, media-infested world of Gerald Fedden's creation.

The cast is uniformly excellent and Dibb is able to coax the acrid aura of England of the 1980s with lucidity and a sensitive eye for revealing corruption and fractured human relationships.  If the viewer is left with the feeling that Nicholas does not really deserve our concern because of his hollow devotion to wealth as a means to happiness then the point of Hollinghurst's novel has been well served.  The film is not without flaws (a pianist at one of the soirees, we are told by supertitles, is paying Grieg's Piano Concerto....when that could not be further from reality!), and insufficient time is given to the Nick/Wani and Nick/Leo relationships to allow us into the inner sanctum of gay life in this tough time, etc., it still is an engrossing drama and one very well played by credible actors.

2614295,4,B000GIXLX4,"Noteworty, but probably a matter of personal taste, is this 3-part TV miniseries from Britain, ""The Line of Beauty,"" on BBC Video, which is based on the Booker-prize winning novel by Alan Hollinghurst.  If you know anything about Thatcher's England in the 1980s, a period of excess that included the introduction of AIDS and the Falklands War, this might appeal to you.  But the characters are mostly unsympathetic, and the story lacks cohesion (as in the novel).  Nick Guest (get it?) comes to live with the family of an up-and-coming Tory politician who lives to please ""The Lady.""  Nick's entree into this world is the politician's straight son Toby (this thread goes nowhere), but he stays on to look after Toby's dysfunctional sister, Cat (whose name may as well be short for catalyst as for Catherine).  There are some grand moments, as when Nick takes Thatcher for a turn on the dance floor, but it all leaves a pretty sour taste in the mouth.  Nick goes on to live with the Feddens for four years, at the end of which he is sadder but probably no wiser.  The actors do a fine job (Dan Stevens will no doubt go on to do a biopic of Oscar Wilde one day), and there are some pretty weighty issues bandied about, but you'll have to decide for yourself whether you want to invest three hours in the lives of these, ultimately, unattractive and rather clueless people.",1167264000,7,1370,4.613168724279835
