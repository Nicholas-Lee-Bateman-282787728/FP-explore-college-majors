4657590,4,B005DCJ0X8,"Haven't watched the other three films, but I love Dracula: The Dark Prince.  One of the more accurate portrayals of Vlad Dracula II.  As historic as your going to get and it even delves into the sci-fi aspect at the end which added to the movie and did not detract from it at all.  Buy just for this alone!",1417219200,,306,4.1525423728813555
4657591,5,B005DCJ0X8,"I only brought this for Dracula: The Dark Prince - one of my favourite movies... and I love how Rudolph Martian appeared on Buffy the Vampire Slayer as Dracula shortly after this film was made ;-)

Other movies were given to family members who love B-grade horror movies. They loved them.",1415664000,,288,4.647058823529412

4657593,5,B005DCJ0X8,"OK, I admit I haven't even watched 3/4 of the movies here, but the review is mainly for Dracula: The Dark Prince. An excellent historical drama of Vlad the Impaler, Prince of Romania, and his struggle against both the Turks and his own noblemen. Well filmed, well acted (including Peter Weller as an Orthodox priest), a real gem, especially surprising as it was made for the SciFi channel (now SyFy), and is head and shoulders above the dreck they put out now, like Sharknado. Perhaps not completely historically accurate, but given the mists of time how accurate any of the stories about Vlad are is open to question, still an enjoyable look into the life of a man who beget a legend.",1413936000,,685,4.622950819672131
4657594,5,B005DCJ0X8,"I was looking for a DVD copy of Dracula: The Dark Prince, and it is actually no longer produced.  It was good fortune to find this combo and get 4 movies for less than $10.",1366329600,2,172,3.914285714285714
4657595,5,B005DCJ0X8,The Dark Prince was worth the movie. The other three was a added bonus. I was very happy with my purchase.,1363564800,4,106,4.095238095238095
4657596,5,B005DCJ0X8,"I can't say much else about the other three films, consider them bonus material.  This set is worth it for Dracula: The Dark prince.  Dracula: The Dark Prince was released by Artisan Home Entertainment (a company that no longer exists) and much like my favorite mini series 10th Kingdom it fell out of print and it's DVD is now very expensive by itself.  This DVD is pretty much what is on the original DVD (including the same start menu) but with new trailers at the beginning.  For Dracula The Dark prince this DVD set is worth it for ten dollars.

Though there are some relatively small historical inaccuracies I found Rudolf Martin's portrayal of Dracula to be incredibly good.  It is no wonder he reprised the role for TV's Buffy verses Dracula (Season 5, episode 1 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer).

This is a very good movie that looks at the good and bad of the historical Dracula and at the end of the film even ties in some of the vampire story so that the film works as a loose prequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula starring Gray Oldman.  I strongly recommend this film for any fan of Dracula or of the history of the middle ages.  The film is very well done, very moody, very atmospheric and surprisingly educational.

This has fast become one of my favorite Dracula movies in that it teaches a fairly true version of the events of the historical Dracula's life and also adds the slight sprinkling of the vampire mythos by implying he became the vampire after death.  Rudolf Martin is a seriously under-rated actor who should get a lot more attention for his Dracula portrayal.",1346457600,9,1580,4.567375886524823

As many have also said, the extra ""programs/tracks"" I consider bonus material, which I haven't viewed to date. The Dark Prince is a historic lesson in confronting A ""Religion"" and/or ""Religious zealots"" head on.
