PROS: Susie seemed knowledgeable, and she is.

CONS: 40 BUCKS FOR A 25 MINUTE DVD!!!!! Susie does not go much into gameplay.

We highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahjongg-for-Beginners/dp/B004EBB3CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahjongg for Beginners</a>&nbsp;Its longer and cheaper and goes more into detail on gameplay and tactics. Did I mention 20 bucks cheaper and longer! The host is very knowledgeable and I learned alot and my wife agree's and we are ready to tackle some tournaments!!!",1291507200,5,663,6.10752688172043
4190389,5,B003TCSG66,"I bought this DVD for my wife who loves Mahjongg.  We watched it together.  It's filmed really well and Susie is very patient.  What a great DVD.  The instruction is clear and precise.  Although my wife has been playing for about a year, she found things in the DVD she did not know.  The video is gorgeous and the instruction is simple to understand.

This is a great find.  I'm surprised it took so long for someone to create a Mahjongg DVD.",1278201600,13,443,4.317073170731708
4190390,5,B003TCSG66,"For months I have been struggling to learn the game of mahjong. Friends and neighbors would patiently try to explain the game to me, but unfortunately all their efforts were useless. I just wasn't able to grasp the (so I thought at the time) complicated rules of the game. I was about to forget the game altogether, when a friend referred me to the DVD ""How to play Mahjongg with Susie"" and, much to the amazement of my many teachers, I am now able to follow and play a full game of mahjong. In the short 25 minute clip, Susie encouragingly explains the game in a straightforward manner. She clearly defines the rules of the game and gives a demonstration of how a real game should go, and possible problems you may encounter while playing. She takes you through a game, helping you along step by step, so when the time comes, you won't be lost without her. Since watching the DVD, I am now able to confidently play mahjong. I definatly recommend this amazingly entertaining and easy to understand DVD to anyone who is interested in, or who has given up in the past due to ""difficulties"" in, learning the game of Mahjong. Thank you Susie!

8405034,5,B003TCSG66,Suzie and her friends will teach you the very basics of mahjongg - I used it when I first started playing and found it very useful.  I play with a group and the group's leader now uses the video to teach new players.,1408492800,,216,4.023255813953488
8405035,4,B003TCSG66,This is a great video.  It really helps with the basics.  I wish it was longer and went into a little more detail and additional examples of possible hands.,1396051200,,156,4.344827586206897
8405036,5,B003TCSG66,"I was disappointed with. Learn Mahjongg With Susie.  I thought it would be more helpful - but it was just the basics of  Mahjongg, which I already knew.  I think it is over priced for the little bit of formation that is  on the DVD.",1395619200,,232,4.088888888888889
8405037,3,B003TCSG66,"This is actually a ""pleasant"" video to watch, as Susie is sweet and has a calm voice.  I suggest getting a used copy of this video.  Don't pay full price for it.  Here's why:  1) Susie demonstrates this American style Mahjongg with her own type of ""house rules"", only mentioning the National Mah Jongg League's method in passing.  For example, Susie says that the NMJL's rule for dealing tiles goes counterclockwise, whereupon she proceeds to deal the tiles clockwise according to her own house rules.  Another example is that the NMJL does the ""Charleston"", but then Susie adds the ""Mish"" (spelling?) after that.  2) The video is just a high level overview and only lasts around 20 minutes.  An absolute beginner such as myself can view it once, as that was enough to get me going.

  The video was useful to me in the way that I had never played American style before and had no one to teach me.  I was having trouble envisioning the way one was supposed to push out the tiles with the pusher, and where and how to break the wall.  I play Chinese Mahjong, where there is a ""Dead Wall"" or ""Flower Wall"", and I couldn't find anything in literature explaining if there was such a thing in American Mah Jongg.

  After viewing this video just once, I didn't need it after that.  This video should only be viewed to get an idea of the flow of the game in general, and should not be viewed without reading *A Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg* by Elaine Sandberg, and the NMJL's *Mah Jongg Made Easy*.  After viewing, I donated the video to our local library, where people could watch it for free.",1392768000,5,1598,4.489583333333333
8405038,5,B003TCSG66,"Twenty minutes of wonderfully clear instructions.  This DVD will help clear things up.  And the more you watch the more you grasp the concept of Mahjongg.  I am reading ""A Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg"".  A good book.  Then watched the DVD ""Learn Mahjongg With Susie"", and everything begins to fall into place.  And continues to enlighten each time I watch the DVD.",1368921600,2,374,4.765625
8405039,1,B003TCSG66,Just very  basic information for the beginner only. I do not recommend purchasing this if you already know the basics. And the DVD was too short for the price.,1367539200,2,159,4.482758620689655
8405040,5,B003TCSG66,"I purchased this ""Learn Mah Jongg with Susie"" DVD and showed it to the 20 students I work with in an elementary gifted and talented program.

The children LOVED it. This video makes mah jongg, which is a fairly difficult game to teach, easy. The visuals and explanations are very good. Yes, it is short, but it is jam-packed with just the information that a beginner needs without going into more complicated strategy. ""Miss Susie,"" as my students call her, explains rules clearly and calmly. She shows how to choose tiles from the wall, decide upon a section & hand, and rules for picking, discarding, and calling tiles.  She explains the vast majority of National Mah Jongg League rules, and even discusses some possible ""table rules.""

This DVD is geared to adults, but it is a great way to introduce mah jongg to children or grandchildren. I would encourage adult friends learning to play mah jongg to watch this video.

My students watched the DVD in 15-minute chunks, and then dove right into a ""real"" game after they practiced making some hands from the NMJL card using Susie's tips. From what I observed, they learned much more quickly than the typical adult beginner who learns from friends -- and I attribute this to ""Learn Mah Jongg With Susie."" They have been so excited to play that we recently purchased three mah jongg sets for our class so that the all of the children can play at once.

Thank you to Susie & friends  -- from the kids & Teacher in Room 111 at Horace Mann Dual Language Magnet School",1357862400,2,1515,4.613382899628252
8405041,5,B003TCSG66,"Wanting to learn the game and did not understand it at all. I bought this video and it gave me a little more in sight of the game. I did take some lessons at night, but Susie is very explanatory and helps you understand the basics of the game.",1355011200,,243,3.979591836734694
8405042,1,B003TCSG66,"The video is sweet -- but BRIEF!!  It's only 15-20 minutes long.  That's a pretty short video for $25.  I felt ripped off.  I certainly didn't learn Mahjongg in that short time frame.  If you are a beginner, you'd be better off with a Mahjongg book.",1334448000,6,249,4.326086956521739
8405043,5,B003TCSG66,"I was given this DVD as a gift. It is excellent. It explains the rules of the game in a simple, clear way. Thank you Susie PS There is a fortune to absorb and I recommend you watch it twice or three times. Then you will feel confident enough to join a group,",1292371200,5,258,3.8867924528301887
