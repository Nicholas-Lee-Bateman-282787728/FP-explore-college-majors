8646606,5,B00IYTDFME,"If you like walks on the beach this Hike-O-Vision is one you'll like.  If you don't like beaches, you might want to try one of the other ones, even though there is a nice section of the Danish-themed town of Solvang also in there.  Its postcard-perfect.
Personally, I would live at the beach if I could so this is the next best thing.  And after all, Im under doctors orders... so yes, five stars here!",1438992000,,402,4.333333333333333
