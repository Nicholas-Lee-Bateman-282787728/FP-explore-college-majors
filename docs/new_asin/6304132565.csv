7863685,2,6304132565,"I loved the original and I loved the 1988 re-make with Traci Lords. I particularly loved Chuck Cirino's music theme to that version. This 1995 re-make of the re-make was particularly lackluster. It seemed to me that the intent in this version was to be a little more serious than the 1988 version. It was kind of a cringing experience to see an actor of Michael York's caliber in this endeavor, though I give him credit for his attempting the role of the alien 'Mr. Johnson'. The one scene that I remember which I thought was pretty good was where a religious proselytizer comes by the alien 'Mr. Johnson's' house and in the encounter they're both these strange, emotionless automatons who seem to be mimicking each others physical movements and at first you don't know if the proselytizer isn't also an alien being. That is a pretty funny scene. Overall, it would be worth it in my opinion to digitally rent this version of Not of This Earth if it should be available. I'm not sure I'd shell out the bucks to own this on DVD or have it permanently on my Amazon Video Library.",1381276800,,1076,4.523076923076923
7863686,1,6304132565,This story has been made into a movie at least three times. Don't waste your time or money with this awful remake.  The  earlier version with Traci Lords is OK.. but the original is one of the forgotten classics of the 1950's..  There are often DVD or VHS copies available on EBAY.  The quality of these transfers is not wonderful... but the movie is great.,1085788800,4,357,4.446153846153846
7863687,2,6304132565,"I have seen both remakes of Roger Corman's Not of this Earth, and I must say his 1957 version with Paul Birch and Beverly Garland was better!  I'm truly not a supporter of remakes, because they never capture in my opinion, the original director or author's ""touch of class.""  I also don't understand why they haven't released Mr. Corman's 1957 version?  Two remakes, but not the original on VHS?  I think somebody has it backwards. Besides, Mr. Birch and Miss Garland have my vote any time.",973900800,16,490,4.662790697674419
7863688,3,6304132565,"Interesting remake of the 50's Roger Corman SCHLOCK CLASSIC.
One of my  favorite horror movies as a kid, complete with Beverly Garland!
Mr.  Corman serves as exec-producer of this most recent film version of a man  (?) from another world, whose planet of inhabitants is dying off from a  airborne blood disorder.  Excellent performance by Michael York as the  sunglassed alien Paul Johnson, whose eyes could flame broil a steak at THE  OUTBACK.  The rest of the cast is mostly forgettable (including Parker  Stevenson, who looks pretty young these days.  Wouldn't you if you never  worked?).
Though the direction is a bit lackluster, the story line holds  up with interesting references to modern day.  The script takes itself too  seriously though, and even though the subject is ""serious"",  adding some witty/funny dialog would have made this a version a  winner!
My main question is, since there have been not one but TWO  remakes... WHY ISN'T THE ORIGINAL AVAILABLE ON HOME VIDEO AT ALL? May I  suggest a deluxe boxed set complete with a pair of those cool RAY  BANS?

7863689,1,6304132565,"This film has nothing to do with the Traci Lords remake or "" Not of This Earth"" 1957/
The 1957 film starred Paul Birch and Beverly Garland. The only interesting point here is the 28 years between the Corman  film and his own remake.( exposing a true sign of the times)",964828800,,268,4.254901960784314
7863690,1,6304132565,Michael York and Tracy Lords (York - Lords...where's her Royal Highness?) stumble their way through what was a classic 50's film by Roger Corman. Lately Michael York in a movie means they couldn't sober up that other  actor they really wanted. And Tracy Lords can't wash off her porno image  and slap on a pretense of being able to act. It's just a waste of time.  Unless you'd prefer not to watch infomercials. I'd rather watch the  infomercials.,921542400,,447,4.6923076923076925
