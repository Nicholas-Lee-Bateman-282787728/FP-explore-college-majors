7269324,3,B00YW5Y54Q,"Good movie, excellent acting by all, however, probably due to special international rights, (mine came from Canada) way too expensive, just one DVD, no extra's, nothing about making off etc. Even the 5.1 did not work (stereo only)",1473379200,,230,5.078947368421052

7269329,4,B00YW5Y54Q,"Due to unplanned circumstances, I find myself going to an American Boy Choir concert in a few weeks. While searching out information about the group, I found several references to the movie ""Boy Choir"". It looked interesting, so I purchased it through Amazon.

The movie centers around a youngster with a difficult past by the name of Stet (short for Stetson). Stet has a notable singing talent. He ends up at the ""National Boy Choir School where, after initial problems, he makes some positive changes in his life.

All in all, the movie follows a fairly typical formula where bad boy makes out good in the end. Garrett Wareing does a commendable job playing Stet. Notable other actors include Dustin Hoffman as the choirmaster and Kathy Bates as the head of the school. The American Boy Choir School of New Jersey was heavily involved in the production of the movie, and the singing and singers of the American Boy Choir are used throughout the film. The singing is very well done. ""Boy Choir"" probably won't win any academy awards, but it is a movie that's worth watching and safe for the whole family to watch.

Even though this is an American film with American actors and set at an American school, I couldn't find an American released version. The version available from Amazon is from the Netherlands. It has Dutch subtitles with no option to turn them off. That was a little distracting. My Blu-Ray player had a little difficulty playing the disc initially, but ultimately corrected itself. It might have been a problem with the way the subtitles were encoded or with the basic formatting of the disc. The Blu-Ray disc is authorized for all regions (A, B, C). (Please note that the DVD version is in PAL format and will not play on U.S. DVD players). Interestingly, there were no additional features on the Blu-Ray. It was just the movie itself with a few trailers for other films.

I did enjoy the film. If you like singing of this kind of choir  as I do  you should enjoy Boy Choir.",1458086400,10,1993,4.6477272727272725
7269330,5,B00YW5Y54Q,"I really love this movie. Both my husband and my daughter are members of the Colchester Civic Orchestra which was used in the scene at Yale and both were in the movie. My daughter was the only bassoon. Unfortunately, you could only see the top of her bassoon and the back of her head, but she was still in it. My husband's instrument was not required, but he helped make up the audience. Very awesome opportunity for both of them. I wish that the ""powers that be"" in the United States had the sense to pick up this movie to show nation wide.",1457308800,2,541,4.262135922330097

7269333,5,B00YW5Y54Q,"An excellent heartfelt movie; and for those of us who are fans of choirs and choir music, it is a rare joy to have a movie that we can relate to. I was fortunate enough to catch it at the only weekend it was showing in my area, and rejoiced at the plot and also the top notch cast. From Dustin Hoffman to Kathy Bates, everyone gave it their all. Garrett Wareing, a newcomer, played the main character with an intensity that is all too rare among young actors. He will be seen on the silver screen next in Independence Day Resurgence, I expect to see a lot more of him in the future. As for buying this DVD, it has been a problem getting it in the USA, however, Amazon's Canada site has plenty available and it is the same region code as the USA. Plus, with the positive exchange rate, it is a super deal. Buy all means buy this rare gem, it is a sleeper that should have received a lot more publicity than it did.",1449964800,14,913,4.106145251396648
8719279,5,B00YW5Y54Q,"I loved this movie, especially since my son spent three years singing in the American Boychoir and attending their boarding school (the fictitious choir in the movie is based on the American Boychoir; they use a number of members of the Boychoir as actors and singers, and even used their bus!) My son's experience was very similar to that depicted in the movie, and he loved singing with them. The story was inspiring, and the music gloriously performed. The star boy singer was outstanding, and the musical discipline required for such a professional choir is very real.

Watching the movie was bittersweet for me, though. I mourned missing out on my son's life experiences, as I was reminded as I watched (singing at Carnegie Hall, traveling the world, singing with major orchestras), because our family lived on the other side of the country.

This movie is a peek into a musical world of which many are unaware. The musical excellence here can't be overstated. Sadly the American Boychoir closed this past year after being in existence since 1937. I'm thrilled Boychoir was finally released and will give people the opportunity to see great boy musicians at work.",1520899200,,1168,4.9238578680203045

8719282,3,B00YW5Y54Q,"I looked forward to this movie as I enjoy listening to boys choirs. Having said that I find a lot of faults with this film. Whoever wrote the dialogue did a very poor job. There were just too many instances where there was no way that people would talk as they did. It's very hard to believe that people in a top notch school would allow some of the things to go on. One boy steals Stet's music right before a huge concert (even though he was supposed to be sick and in bed) and things just move right along. In another scene the ENTIRE choir goes along when that same boy posts unflattering material in the lunch room, there are apparently NO ADULTS around to prevent this. There are many other examples that would make me shudder to have to go to a school such as that. However, the music is fine and if you can just close your eyes and listen to the singing it's enjoyable. I just feel that this could have been a LOT better with better script.",1493424000,,947,4.208791208791209
