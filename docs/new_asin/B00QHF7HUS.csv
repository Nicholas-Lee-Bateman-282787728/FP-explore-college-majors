8691313,5,B00QHF7HUS,"As soon as I heard that this documentary is available at amazon.com, I immediately purchase this DVD.  I am one of the graduates of this school.  From poverty, Fr. Al and the Sisters of the Sisters of Mary School nurtured and educated us without asking financial assistance from our family.  This movie is the flashback of my life when I was at this school back 1988-1992.  From the very first day I was admitted to study in this school till now, I am still thankful to the donors and sponsors of the Sisters of Mary School.  This movie is a must to watch!

Although the setting of the movie is in the Philippines centered at the Sisters of Mary School, there is English subtitle for everybody to understand. Grab your copy and see the real story behind the life of the poor children educated by the school.",1422144000,,807,4.45578231292517
8691314,5,B00QHF7HUS,I didn't expect to watch such a great documentary. The characters are well defined and the story is very moving. Such a shame we don't see those quality documentaries on general television anymore...,1417651200,,199,5.0606060606060606
