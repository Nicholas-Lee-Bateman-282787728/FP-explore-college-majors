3877150,3,B0029LI69A,"I was incredibly excited when I heard that Alvin & The Chipmunks would be having a sequel, cutely called a ""squeakquel.""  My family and were excited to see it soon after it came out, but it unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations.

The Chipmunks were still as charming as ever, and the Chippettes, a new addition, were adorable, their rendition of Beyonce's ""Single Ladies"" rocked the house.  Unfortunately, the plot for the humans in this book was sadly disappointing.  I missed Dave, who was in the movie barely at all.  The jobless cousin that took Dave's place as The Chipmunks caretaker was interesting but not nearly as good.

However, I still think that younger children would adore this movie.  The Chipmunks and The Chippettes were fabulous.",1262563200,7,758,4.921259842519685
3877151,1,B0029LI69A,"The laughs and charming moments were few and far between in the Chimpmunks ""Squeakquel.""  Based on the trailer I had agreed to see it, but it didn't live up to even that modest potential.  Even the 10-year old who was the primary moviegoer judged it ""disappointing.""  You may be asking ""what did I expect from a kids' movie?"" but the truth is that I love good kids' movies.  I would have rather watched ""The Wizard of Oz,' anything by Pixar, or ""Coraline"" again at home on DVD rather than spend sixteen dollars and two hours of my life on this lazy production.

I liked the new girl group the Chipettes, who had the potential to breathe some new life into this classic cartoon, but they were sparingly used.  There should have been a lot more music because that's when the movie came to life.  Other than that it was mostly mayhem, bullying, and fart jokes.  Is it funny to see a woman in a wheelchair fall down the stairs?  No.  Is it funny to see the Chipmunk's human ""father"" Dave get put into traction?  No.  Is it funny to see Simon get bullied by a toilet swirlie or get bashed with a dodge ball by the popular boys at school?  No.

The movie's script is really lazy--the kind of film where the villainous record producer (who was actually pretty funny at times, because he went for total ham and cheese with his comic humiliation) says, ""I need to find more singing chipmunks,"" and then the next scene shows the three incredibly talented and cute female Chipettes FedExing themselves to him to ask him to make them singing stars.  That was easy.

The character Alvin is supposed to have attitude but I found him really grating.  But the thing that really makes me give this movie one star is that the all of the human actors deserve better.  Jason Lee (who is really only in it for 5 minutes, good for him I guess), Wendie Malick, Zachary Levi, David Cross, Kathryn Joosten make up an eclectic and talented cast and it pained me to see them acting into the air opposite animated chipmunks.  (I kept thinking that Wendie Malick must have been jealous of Christine Baranski's scene stealing role in ""Mamma Mia.""  Here Malick is stuck with the indignity of playing a school principal who secretly sports a chipmunk fan tattoo.  Yuck.)  And the celebrity voices of the chipmunks were totally wasted, Justin Long, Amy Poehler, Christina Applegate...they are unrecognizable anyway.

The CGI animation of the chipmunks is good, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  The previews before the show included two more awful-looking CGI animal movies coming soon to a theater near you, ""Furry Vengeance"" with Brendan Fraser and Brooke Shields, in which Fraser is farted on by skunks and locked in a porta potty by furry woodland animals, and ""Cats & Dogs:  The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" a cats and dogs spy movie with Chris O'Donnell.  Quick, someone write a better screenplay for these beloved stars of the '90s and '00s, and invite the cast of ""Alvin and the Chimpunks,"" too!",1262304000,8,2974,4.638623326959847
3877152,5,B0029LI69A,"I just recently had the pleasure in seeing Alvin and the Chipmunks squeakquel in theaters on Dec 30, 2009.. I'm a grown women but always will be a kid at heart. I myself really enjoyed this movie. It was funny, good hearted, and decent for kids and grown ups of all ages. Usually when there are sequels to movies they aren't usually as good as the first one. BUT my opinion in the case of this movie is certainly not true. It's a Squeakquel well done. I would love to go see it again. I will also buy it when it comes out on blu-ray hopefully in a double pack edition with the dvd also. I give this movies two thumbs up. For anybody that wants to go see a great decent, clean family movie full of laughs.. I surely recommend this one to  you!!!

3877153,5,B0029LI69A,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable, funny, and well done.  Yeah, Dave Seville is missing, but I thought that the movie held it's own throughout anyway!  I am in my mid forties with a seven year old daughter and we both laughed.  I disagree with comparison to ""The Princess and the Frog"" altogether. For some reason now, every Disney movie (I've seen both The Christmas Carol and The Princess and The Frog in the last two weeks)has to have something very creepy that scares the kids.  The black blobs that were reminiscent to the ones in GHOST with Patrick Swayze scared my daughter into not watching for a few minutes.  It is DISNEY for goodness sake.  And The Christmas Carol was just ridiculous as far as scaring younger kids.  So, my vote definitely goes with this new Chipmunk movie which we both could watch all the way through and loved.",1262131200,5,848,4.5394736842105265
3877154,5,B0029LI69A,"Adults and kids who enjoy humor and harmony will love this film.  The production is stellar and it's the best film I've seen in a decade, certainly the best this year!",1262044800,3,167,4.387096774193548
3877155,2,B0029LI69A,"One good film deserves a sequel--Or Squeakquel, in this case.  Unfortunately, for some of the audience, the second film does not necessarily live up to the fun of the first.

There are two audiences for Chipmunks films.  The first are, of course, the children.  In this case, the third generation of kids who are fans of David Seville's creations.  The second are the older fans who grew up with the music and the cartoons.

The kids (and in some cases, grandkids) generally loved this movie.  There was a lot of action and fun as Alvin, Theodore and Simon rollicked through High School and eventually learned some important life lessons.  The older fans, like my husband and I, may well be somewhat disappointed.

Why?  My husband and I, who grew up with the original Chipmunk craze, came to one conclusion:  Dave is missing.  In the first part of the film, Alvin manages to sideline Dave (Jason Lee) and he's only seen at the very beginning and end of the show.  Instead of Dave, the trio had Dave's slacker cousin Toby (Zachary Levi) as their guardian and Toby just didn't really care about the furkids like Dave does.

Of course, we had a return of the evil manager, Ian (David Cross) who was staging his renaissance by representing the three-girl Chipettes, but they just were pale female imitations of the Chipmunks.

If you're looking for a holiday film for the kids, this is a decent choice, though I'd actually recommend Disney's excellent THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG instead.

3877156,1,B0029LI69A,"I certainly didn't intend to watch the first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, but as my kids watched it, I found parts of it to be humorous and enjoyable. Dave Seville, played by Jason Lee of MY NAME IS EARL fame, was perhaps the best part for the adults. It was fun to watch his interactions with his furry little singing friends. Then the sequel came along. I didn't want to see it, but went along with the family for a Christmas outing.

The first thing wrong is that Jason Lee and Dave Seville is not in this movie at all except for the first five minutes and last five minutes. Why? What did he have to do that was so important? So, when he's in it, he's doing his trademark ""Aaalllvvviiinnn"" yell as much as possible. The rest of the movie is horrible. The chipmunks are sent to high school where the jocks feel immediately threatened by them. The three rodents get involved with different groups and all kinds of ""hilarious"" hijinks ensue. And then the Chipettes show up. They bring nothing to the movie either.

David Cross as Ian is back as well. He was funny in the first, but his act grows old in the second. As the credits rolled, I saw all kinds of famous people like Justin Long, Anna Farris and Amy Polhler lent their voices to the Chipmunks. Why?

As it is with most kid movies, your kids will probably enjoy watching it once. But for the adults, it will be one of the worst movies you will ever see.",1261958400,5,1414,4.30827067669173

3877382,4,B0029LI69A,"My 6-year-old niece loves this Chipmunks movie the best out of the 3 currently existing (sure there will be more eventually). Surprisingly, I also found it to be entertaining (not to the point where I would want to watch it multiple times like she does). It keeps her entertained throughout the movie (most of the time - she is only 6 so her attention occasionally flits to other things). If your young one is a fan of either or both of the other Chipmunks movies, you should give this a look-see also. Have fun!

3877561,1,B0029LI69A,"I admit, I kind of liked the first `Chipmunks' movie.  It was harmless fun.  Having grown up on the cartoon and really loved some of the movies as a kid, I was secretly excited to see this and so when I was forced to watch it on a long car-ride with my girls, I was happy.  It was funny; borderline stupid but funny.  I wasn't moved to see any of the sequels though.  It's not like the first movie was a revelation, and usually when a decent but dumb kids movie has a sequel, it is a mess.

Alas, this came on TV and my daughter went crazy and I was forced to watch it.

`Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel' is a total mess.  It has a very clichd premise that continues to deliver one poorly conceived joke or plot point after another.  The gags feel recycled from the original film with less gusto, and the regurgitated use of David Cross (who is a terrible actor and should be homeless on the street by now) is irritating.  Jason Lee is replaced by Zachary Levi (my only guess is that Lee had scheduling conflicts and so his character was given minimal scenes) and the Chipmunks are dropped in school where teenage girls can swoon over them and teenage boys and become jealous.  I'm being serious.  The teenage boys actually think that these rodents are going to steal the girls away from them to the point where they give them swirlies and threaten to beat them up and stage ridiculous pranks (the trash monitor thing was particularly unfunny) to make them feel embarrassed.  While this is going on, the Chipettes show up and Ian, the evil manager from the first film, swoops them up in order to make money for himself and the Chipmunks and the Chipettes have a sing off while Alvin battles his priorities.

And LOL at that horribly annoying girl from the Taco Cabana commercials being in this movie!

UGH, this was awful.  It was just dumb from start to finish and a terrible excuse for children's entertainment.  I have no problem letting my girls watch movies that are beneath me as an adult because they are kids and one cannot expect them to appreciate films directed at adults, but children's films can be smart and engaging and enjoyable for all ages, and this is just NOT.  Also,  I found the Chipette's suggestive gyrating to be sending a very poor message to my four year old.

""Dave"" is only in the movie for probably 5 minutes total! Introducing 'girl' chipmunks (the Chip-ettes, as they call them) who are identical to the boys- in personality, shape and size and even what they wear...a far stretch for entertaining I think. And, maybe it's just me, but I think all the chipmunks are a little harder to understand what they are supposed to be saying. Overall, my son who obviously can't comprehend the movie loves it- so good movie for kids. For adults, in my opinion...just so-so.",1333324800,,676,4.549180327868853
3877567,4,B0029LI69A,"I plan on buying a copy after watching the library's copy multiple times! I was pleasantly surprised that it was not obnoxious like so many child-star-diven films.

It was refreshing to have child characters (the Chupmunks and Chipettes) show good manners, caring towards eachother and the adults, and respect for authority. Even in high school, a notorious place for youth to be profiled being disrespectful to authority and rebellious.

The story is believable in many points, from high school bullying and wrong priorities (jocks), to adolescent crushes, star struck young people with a dream (Chipettes),and crooked managers. Theodore's reactions to siblings fighting was touching, and gives the ""slower"" child a character to connect with. He is sensitive to home disruptions and the others look out for him. Nice.

There was only one disgusting joke about ""dutch oven"" and passing gas in bed.

That's great for a juvenile comedy! I can live with that.

3877588,5,B0029LI69A,"The Squeakquel is probably a tad better than the first Alvin and the Chipmunks if for no other reason than because the first one is all about showing us what it's like to see animated chipmunks interacting with real humans in a real environment, so it mainly keeps things simple focusing around Dave, the chipmunks getting into constant trouble, and keeps things closer to home for the most part.

The sequel... oh alright, FINE!  I'll say it again- the Squeakquel, is less about Dave (who only makes a couple brief appearances) and more about the chipmunks going to a public school with teenagers.  While there, they join a music class and a football team, and even participate in a dodgeball match.

The female chipmunks are definitely hilarious, and are basically the same as the regular familiar gang of Alvin, Theodore and Simon.

The storyline is about the chipmunks (including the three girls) getting the opportunity to perform on stage and put up a sing and dance show for the audience.  Of course obstacles happen to come along and stand in the way of achieving such an amazing dream.

The humor is about the same as the first movie, so if the first one drove you delightfully crazy, this one will as well, haha.

I really have nothing but positive things to say about the sequel.  It's just as outrageous and hilarious as the first one with a storyline that packs excitement, sincerity and even a little bit of character development involving Simon and Alvin getting into a personal conflict over school matters.

A great movie for everybody in the house, this is sure to make everyone crave for a third film in the series.  The only negative is that the lack of Dave means a lot less ""ALVIN!!!!!""

That's the only complaint, truthfully.  Great funny little movie.",1295136000,,1775,4.742671009771987

3877600,2,B0029LI69A,"The singing Chipmunk trio comes back in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel."" This time three chipmunks Alvin, Simon and Theodore go to school, and Alvin even plays football before his cheering fans. The film also introduces the Chipettes, three singing female chipmunks Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette (from the 80s TV series), and the Chipettes are tricked by an evil (and disgraced) former producer Ian (David Cross reprising the role).

But why do they have to be in high school? Why does the film have to repeat the same storyline about the kids / animals deceived by a greedy adult? I think I know who the film's target audience is, but why references to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""? And pole dance? (Incidentally, ""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" also has a parody of ""Lambs."" So what is going on in Hollywood?)

I am not surprised if Jason Lee as Dave, who should be one of the key characters of the franchise, looks very reluctant to come back, staying out of the story for most of the film. There are also some episodes about the chipmunks' new guardian Toby (Zachary Levi) and his romantic interest, a subplot you don't care.

There are slapstick bits in ""The Squeakquel."" Many of them. I like slapstick humor. I like Buster Keaton films and ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons. The gags of ""The Squeakquel"" include breaking and throwing things. That is OK with me, but in this film they are not just things, but an old lady's wheelchair (broken), Dave's leg (broken) and poor chipmunks themselves (not broken, but thrown into a toilet and a trash can). Maybe we are supposed to laugh, though I found the idea of chipmunks and high school bullies is not very funny.

The film's special effects are just OK. The voices of the Chipettes are provided by Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate, but I don't see the point of casting them when their voices are post-processed to suit the characters. Finally, the film is directed by Betty Thomas, director of Eddie Murphy's ""Doctor Dolittle.""

Granted, it wasn't anything brilliant, but it was funny & entertaining enough for a watch or two. Then I decided to watch this movie with the family. The results? ALVIN! WHY DID YOU MAKE SUCH A BAD MOVIE?!?

The major problem with the film is the fact that it takes place in High School for most of the movie. That's right, a regular high schol, with famous Chipmunks, and the Princible is a secret huge fan of the group. The film then proceeds to play out like a generic newcomer-to-high-school-film. As in, the Chipmunks struggle to gain acceptance, get bullied, blah, blah, blah. Oh, then at one point, Alvin decideds to turn his back on his friends, and they get mad at each other. Then there's Ian, and he has the Chipettes. Oh, and Jason Lee is in the hospital, so the video-game addicted Zachary Levi has to ""look after them.""

Really, at such low expectations, Chipmunks didn't really have that much to live up to, but it fails to even reach this high bar. Everything is so uninspired, and much of the jokes fell flat. Granted, the movie did provide enough laughs for the rest of the family for them to get through it, but after a while, it just became painful.

There are a few problems. First, Dave (Jason Lee), the father figure in the first film, is unceremoniously dumped early on in favor of Toby (Zachary Levi), a loser who adds little to the film. Also, the villain, Ian (David Cross), seems more interested in being goofy than a real villain. The high school setting also takes away from the plot and seems out of place. I suspect the film would have been better had it focused more on the Chipmunks and less on the humans. That being said, this is a fun movie and should appeal to kids. The Chipettes are a good addition and manage to have their own personalities. This squeakquel will be fun, but not as enjoyable for adults as the first.",1276300800,,1094,6.448979591836735
3877612,5,B0029LI69A,"Featuring lovable characters, a relatively simple but highly effective plot, and more laughs and charm than most recent comedies could dream of obtaining, the second installment in the new adventures of Alvin, Simon and Thoedore outdoes its predecessor and hits a high point as probably 2009's best comedy.

  Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel sends the three chipmunks, now international pop music sensations, to a place more terrifying than any grueling world tour or high-hype press conference: school.  With their adoptive dad Dave injured after a stunt goes awry at one of the concerts, the chipmunks are left in the care of clueless relative Toby, leaving the three l'il furballs to navigate the perils of the educational system on their own.  Meanwhile, a trio of female chipmunks - Britney, Jenette and Eleanor - inspired by the original Chipmunks's success, set out to make it big themselves, but fall under the sway of Alvin and company's dastardly ex-manager.  Not surprisingly, the new trio ends up in the same school as the originals, where they become unwilling competitors in a rivalry sparked by the ex-manager, as well as opposing each other in a contest to represent the school at a regional music talent contest.

  The perils of school affect the 3 original chipmunks in different ways: all three are targeted by bullies, but Alvin is the most likely to fall in with the 'wrong crowd'.  Simon is, of course, the star brain, and that leaves poor Theodore as the most 'fish out of water' character.  For those worried that the 'bullying' angle will be too upsetting or depressing for younger viewers, fear not.  I don't think it's letting any cats out of any bags to say that the good guys come out on top in this; the scene where Alvin and Simon come to the aid of a persecuted Theodore, that alone is worth the price of the DVD.  Speaking of Theodore, although I love all six chipmunks in here, there is undeniably something special about Theodore.  He's so pure in his good will and earnest innocence that he steals the most scenes of any character in the movie.

  Great animation (especially on the facial expressions), highly entertaining 'chipmunk-ized' versions of familiar songs, genuine laugh-out-loud moments and tonnes of cute appeal all raise this up to one of 2009's gems.  Among recent comedies it has few rivals -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ponyo-Two-Disc-Edition/dp/B002ZTQVGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ponyo (Two-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;is actually the only 2009 one that equals its comedic value, and that isn't even considered a comedy (hence Squeakquel's claim to the 'best comedy' title).  There were a few others, both in the 'kids' sections and in the 'regular' comedy sections that were also good, but overall I didn't think 2009 was the best year for humorous fare (other genres of movies had a far better year, in my opinion).  A movie like Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, though, make up for a Lot of lost ground.  Truly, a movie for everybody, not just the younger set.",1275955200,,3079,5.130260521042084

3877628,4,B0029LI69A,"As a product of the '80s how could I not at least give this movie a try? While this one as well as the first installment were not given much of a fair fight amongst critics, like in the film the true fans of The Chipmunks...and The Chippetes have spoken.

The Squeakuel picks up where the first one left off and the best part about sequels, is there is a chance for more character development. This movie brought alot of the TV series into it byt sending the boys off to school and fitting in with kids their age. I have to say I did not expect them to end up in High School, but then again we really don't how old they are in the movie. The boys now have to face the everyday challenges of life, fitting and more importantly knowing what comes first in life. Adding the Chippetes into this second film is a treat for us fans of the 1980's show. The girls were very well voiced and had the characterisitcs of their animated counterparts...well not so much Brittney...yet. While they didn't get as much face time as I would have wanted they did play an important role in the movie and now there is a 3rd installment in the works so I am wondering what is going to happen. I would love to see a singing showdown between the two groups singing The Boys/Girls of Rock N' Roll.

This movie was adorable and I had a big smile on my face from begining to end. If you liked the first Chipmunks you will enjoy this one just as much.",1273017600,,1423,4.189781021897811

The music is such a large part of why we love the chipmunks. There was little chemistry between the chipmunks and chipettes.

3877643,3,B0029LI69A,"It was nice to have the ""guys"" back again in this squeakquel but the movie just didn't live up to the hype or the first movie.  It needed the character Dave to be in it more and maybe Claire (Dave's romantic interest).  The swapping of guardians, the plot that didn't take the time to really go in depth with any of the story lines, trying to explain all the new characters, and too little music just really took away from the movie and made it seem kind of hollow.  I didn't like the style of music the Chipettes sang or how they sang the music.  The Chipmunks were great in the first because they sang classics with a twist.

It was still interesting to see being a fan of the first movie and the kids may get into the movie but for an adult it was missing sold plot points.  The people producing the movie tried to do too much in too little time and ended up doing not enough too much of the time.

Unless you have kids, would be better to rent or borrow than buy.",1271203200,,967,4.111702127659575

All I had to do was swich sound tracks using the button on my DVD player's remote, and there was narration to inform me of the visual aspects of the movie. It was fantastic!
While I personally think that audio description should be available as an option on every DVD that is ever released, just like alternate language tracks or closed captioning, I realize that this is too much to hope for. So, I just had to write a review to thank whoever thought to provide this fantastic feature on this DVD at least.

3877648,2,B0029LI69A,"Riddle me this; What's the point in hiring ""big name"" actors (Jesse McCartney, Anna Faris, Christina Applegate & Amy Poehler) when all you're gonna do is raise the pitch of their voices to the point of unrecognition and on top of that get other people to do the singing anyway? The producers could've really saved money by just getting the same people to do the talking and singing voices and nobody would've been able to hear the difference. Like Dakota Fanning in New Moon, I hope Jason Lee was well paid for about his fifteen minutes of screen time but the character should've been written out entirely if all they were going to use him for was uninspired slapstick that wasn't even funny when I saw it in Son of the Pink Panther. I do wish that each of the Chipettes got to interact with their male counterparts but the Simon-esque Chipette hardly features at all (the Theodore girl features a little more but they're mainly just background when compared to the lead and if it weren't for the sake of having all three characters, they could've done the whole movie without them). I do remember watching the cartoon series in the 90s, it wasn't my favorite thing (I think Pokemon or Power Rangers was the ""in thing"" at the moment but for the life of me I can't remember) but it was still enjoyable. One reason I probably remember enjoying it over this mess was the fact that the Chimpmunks and their female knock-offs were about the size of a small child and attend school. Not the literal size of the animal and still attend school! There's suspension of disbelief and then there's shear stupidity! How can anyone believe that actual chipmunks could go to school and be immediately accepted without the Board of Health getting involved? The CGI is unconvincing (but not outright silly looking as the blue cat things in Avatar) and makes me respect the puppetry and miniatures used in films past (like the older Bond films, Little Shop of Horrors, Batman, Superman, etc.) The plot is a rehash of the first, just with the inclusion of the Chipettes, but is actually not as obvious, like Blues Brothers 1998- er I mean 2000. Another thing that bugs me (but actually more against the first than this); how did the soundtrack to that beat out Sweeney Todd and Mamma Mia! for best soundtrack at the Grammys? At least for the other two, you could understand the performers and enjoy the song (regardless of what you people think of Brosnan's singing ability). This is a pretty harmless film for kids, like a 10 year old, but I think that's because they don't know any better and I can only hope that they listen to the songs performed by the original artist when they get older and develop a taste in music and film.",1271030400,,2713,4.5958762886597935

3877661,4,B0029LI69A,"When Ross Bagdasarian Sr.  created the Alvin and the Chipmunks, I often wonder if he knew at the time of how popular those characters, their music and the animated series would be for American pop culture.

Popular for the music, it was in 1961 when the three went from being puppets to an animated show.  Bagdasarian using his stage name Dave Seville, the music composer and father/caretaker of three talented chipmunks who tend to get into a little mischief.  The animated series ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is one of those animated series that has been part of the childhood of several generations.  An even more animated series continued throughout the '80s and '90s.

And as ""Alvin and the Chipmunks has been a part of the childhood of children for five decades, for this generation of children, they are now getting acquainted by Alvin, Simon and Theodore through their animated CG films.  And what a remarkable success the first film had been for Twentieth Century Fox as ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" made over $361 million worldwide (the budget of the film was $60 million).

Needless to say, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" earned their right for a sequel and before Christmas 2009, the $75 million dollar sequel ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" made even more money than the first earning over $442 million worldwide and now, this popular film which introduces us to the female chipmunks ala ""The Chipettes"": Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette and featuring more star-power providing the voices for the characters.

VIDEO:

""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 1:85:1).  Immediately, the first thing that catches your attention is the wonderful CG animation of the chipmunks and how they flawlessly work with the real life backgrounds and props.

Many scenes are shot outdoors and with very good lighting indoors that a lot of the detail can be seen in the trees, the plants, outdoor areas to the pores in the skin of the humans and of course, seeing the fur of the chipmunks with such detail.  The film looks absolutely vibrant and detail is very good for this film.  Skintones are natural, blacks are nice and deep and I saw no problems with artifacts, DNR or blurring.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 5.1 Dolby Digital Descriptiive Audio and Spanish/French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is dialogue and music driven through the center and front channel speakers.  But there are special effects such as Alvin tossing a Wiimote into the TV, a wheelchair falling off Toby's car and various sound effects like that.  Surround channels tend to utilize the crowd ambiance much more in the film.

But since the film is primarily dialogue and music driven, dialogue is clear and understandable while the music definitely comes alive with the lossless audio soundtrack.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I grew up with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and can easily remember watching the television series during my younger years and have watched a fair share of the anime series on DVD as well, introducing it to my seven-year-old son who absolutely loves the first film.

Sure enough, we watched ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" and he was laughing and enjoying the film.  As for me, I enjoyed the humor of the film and granted, I may not be the intended demographic for this film, but as a parent, watching my son and seeing him enjoy characters that I grew up with as a child was definitely a fun, family moment.  In fact, he enjoyed the film so much that we watched it for a second time (along with the wife) and continued to laugh at the jokes and hijinks... ""the dutch oven"" joke was just hilarious!

I definitely enjoyed the picture quality of this Blu-ray release and how alive the lossless audio soundtrack (especially from the music) coming through my speakers.  Needless to say, there are plenty of music featured in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" and again, watching my son bop to the songs, I have no doubt that this film will do the same for the children watching this film.  Also, for parents, there are plenty of special features and fun sing-a-longs and if you are commuting, you also get a DVD and digital copy of the film as well.

Overall, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" was an entertaining film which I enjoyed much more over the first film.  The addition of the Chipettes was pretty cool and definitely enjoyed the animation and overall storyline for this sequel.  As mentioned earlier in my review, there is a good number of star power in this film and a lot of of music covers.  Definitely interesting to see ""Chuck"" actor Zachary Levi in a more comedic role and also to see Filipino singer Charice Pempengco jamming on the film as well!  But of course, the star power behind the voices of Alvin and the Chipmunks and the Chipettes did a wonderful job.  For Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate, the three did a wonderful job.

If you are a parent looking for a fun, family film...you can't go wrong with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" and if you are an adult who grew up with Alvin and the Chipmunks, you'll definitely enjoy this film as well! Definitely recommended!",1269907200,31,7656,4.8782945736434105

I was a little skeptical about the first one (being a fan of the original cartoon), but changed my mind after seeing it.  Then I couldn't wait to see the squeakquel.  If you like the chipmunks - you'll LOVE THIS Movie...",1269820800,,297,4.462962962962963
3877663,1,B0029LI69A,"I was practically forced to see this movie since I was watching 2 kids and they wanted to see it. I was never a fan of the original chipmunks, because I found them very annoying. The new chipmunks, even MORE ANNOYING. I cannot stand the sound of ANY of those things voices - I though my ears were going to start bleeding. The jokes were lame and the whole plot seemed like it was just pulled out of someones butt. I asked the 2 kids I was watching how they liked it and they said that it was not as good as they thought it would be. This movie may be entertaining for some children, but if you enjoy listening to rodents with voices comparable to nails on a chalk board and lame puns, well then your in luck.",1269561600,6,708,4.100719424460432
3877664,5,B0029LI69A,"Very cute movie for any age.

I laughed, I even cried...It's just absolutely adorable, and very child appropriate...enjoy it!",1269475200,,125,5.578947368421052
3877665,4,B0029LI69A,"It's a kids movie. My first grader liked it. That's worth 4 stars. Very high ""cuteness factor."" Lots of energy and silly antics, of course (isn't that expected from Chipmunks?). Appealed to her and she was happy w/ the experience. I thought it was a little long (7 yo got wiggly) and the story was choppy, but I'm an adult, so who cares? :) We saw it at a dollar movie theater, so I couldn't feel bad about the value. Might be worth adding to a kids video library, but it won't be a top ten favorite, in my opinion.",1269129600,4,515,4.16
3877666,5,B0029LI69A,"Nah, I began to like ALvin & the Chipmunks cuz of Charice and now I got this CD to hear No One cover by Charice.  She sings great and the Chippetes backing her up is quite funny.",1269043200,3,178,3.810810810810811
3877667,5,B0029LI69A,"I took my 3 year old daughter to see this when it opened in theaters as an early Christmas present last year.  She loves Alvin & The Chipmunks and, as a child of the 80's, I enjoy this reimagining of the story as well; it's hard to swallow chipmunks the size of human children as depicted on the cartoon.  Fun for the whole family from toddlers to grandparents!",1268611200,3,361,4.294117647058823
3877668,4,B0029LI69A,"I thought this was a really cute movie and very good squeakquel to the original. After Dave is injured during a concert, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are watched by Toby and forced to go to public School. Their enemy, Ian is back and finds the Chipettes, and they compete against the Chipmunks in Battle of the Bands. I highly recommend ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: THE SQUEAKQUEL!!!",1266969600,,377,4.7272727272727275
3877669,5,B0029LI69A,"I've seen the first chipmunk movie. It was okay, kinda cute. But I slowly began to hate it because it seemed like everywhere I went, the movie was playing! It got annoying, there are only so many times you can here the Chipmunk Christmas song.

Now when I saw the teaser for the second movie with my family, we all laughed at it, and I automatically knew I wanted to see it. The first one may have been annoying at times, but this one was going to have the chipettes in it, so it should be a little bit better (I've always been a chipettes fan), and.... I was right.

This movie was way better than the first one. It had humor, action, and some good lessons about family and friends. And the chipmunk romance made me smile. I liked the songs too, especially the songs the chipettes sang. The song at the end, ""We Are Family"" was so catchy, I uploaded it to my iPod a week later!

I loved it, and if you need another reason to see it, my 7 year old cousin enjoyed it too. So, kids love it, and I (a teen) love it. If you need a good family film, watch this movie (I'm not sure about the original, although you should probably watch it before this movie so you aren't confused).",1266624000,4,1176,4.149122807017544
3877670,4,B0029LI69A,"We've seen the movie twice and the grandchildren, ages 7 and 3, loved it both times. They were dancing in the aisles. Good, clean, fun movie. They still watch the first movie and I will be buying this one when released.",1265673600,3,219,4.365853658536586
3877671,1,B0029LI69A,"This was almost as bad as the 1st which I'd give a minus 3 I only saw it in hopes it'd go into  the  Chipettes oragins.  It didn't  in fact rather than  bother to go into anything close to the classic cartoons  values it centered around  compitition,  some nitwit cousin and a few sight gag. the only redeption at all was when Alvin did risk his life to protect Theadore from a bird of prey..  Frankly my cat could've writen a better story.
For you who want to introduce your kids  to the chipmunks who had comedy and  values try the Cartoons that are now avaiable on DVD.  Don't waste time or money on this tripe.",1265587200,3,614,4.198275862068965
