3919323,5,B002ERQWVI,"I think Sid the Science Kid is an adorable show as do my boys, so I knew they would enjoy this one.  It is a show about a kindergarten class that uses science to learn.  There are four friends, each different and unique, but all best friends.  This DVD is especially neat because it is all about weather, which is a hard subject to explain to kids, at least to my 3 year old!  The episodes cover rain and clouds, using sunscreen and the sun, snow and cold temperatures, and wind!  Sid has some great adventures in these episodes and the show really does explain science in a way for young kids to understand.  There is also lots of singing involved, which is quite cute!  Overall, I would recommend this DVD to any parent looking for ways to help their children understand why rain is okay, what clouds really are (no not cotton candy!), why sunscreen is important, how cold weather can be fun, and how wind can be fun (flying kites!)",1274313600,7,934,4.395348837209302

3919326,5,B002ERQWVI,"This show is done amazingly well. It is educational, but also holds my kids (ages 2 and 4) attention. They understand and follow what is going on we can recreate the experiments done on the videos at home. Science is now available for even the youngest children!

3919387,1,B002ERQWVI,"Not a fan of this, even though there are a lot of people out there who are. I just don't get it. Pretty much everything JHC has done has been brilliant... until this.

One of the things I dislike about this show is how Sid talks like someone with a developmental disorder. I know there will be overly sensitive people out there who will call me ""rude"", ""insensitive"", whatever, but that's really what it sounds like to me, folks. I really put my foot down when my toddler, who had a very well developed verbal skills, started talking like Sid, with the stutters and inflections, and all - just like Sid. Made me cringe. So, yes, IMO the vocal talent is terrible.

The animation is probably the worst part of the show, however (once again, IMO). Remember when JHC pioneered in puppetry? Long before the days of incessant CGI, we had one lonely crusader in Hollywood who kept the torch lit brightly on how to make live-action characters, instead of falling back on cheap computer graphics. I was floored when I realized this was JHC. Without knowing what's going on, it seems to me the current owners of JHC are merely cashing in on the companies name while putting out sub-par product that pales in comparison to the creative genius it used to be.

Once again, that's just MY opinion folks. Don't get all bent out of shape over it! I know there are many rabid die-hard Sid fans out there who can't help picking fights with people who have anything bad to say about this show. But you need to get over it. Maybe you should all watch the episode about respecting other people's opinions, eh?",1356048000,,1588,4.526132404181185
3919388,5,B002ERQWVI,My children do not have cable but grama does and they loved this. so I guess as long as i t educational (it totally is) I guess a half hour to an hour of TV won't be bad.,1355788800,,170,3.5
3919389,5,B002ERQWVI,"I recommend this product if your son or daughter like music, my daughter is 2 year old and she is busy but when I need a little free time I put this video and other and she is fine, wash tv and help her learn more. This helps increase her knowledge.",1353456000,,249,3.9019607843137254
3919390,5,B002ERQWVI,This is a great pack of videos. My toddler LOVES Sid and these videos. The shows are educational and have catchy songs. Even I like watching Sid! Great video set!,1350864000,,162,4.433333333333334
