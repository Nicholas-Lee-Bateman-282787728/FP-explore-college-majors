8404742,4,B003SWF84A,Good acting and interesting story. It was a fun drama to watch and it kept my interest. I saw some familiar faces. I don't know if the study tips are real but it sounds good.,1389398400,,174,4.0
8404743,4,B003SWF84A,"Master of Study is a remake of the Japanese series Dragon Zakura I believe. It's about a bunch of high school kids going to a loser school where no one cares about their studies, and it's up to the teachers to inspire these kids, help them change their ways, and excel. The fluorescent uniforms were cute, we should have those in all schools lol. But for me the highlight was watching Yoo Seung Ho as one of the main students. I first saw him in ""The Way Home"" back in 2002 as a bratty little boy, and he has remained a great actor ever since then (also in the movie Blind, Hearty Paws, Queen Seondeok, Warrior Baek Dongsoo, etc). This is a good drama to watch for an uplifting and happy story. It's a nice change from all the dramas with love triangles, angst, and terminal illnesses.",1335830400,,785,4.346938775510204
