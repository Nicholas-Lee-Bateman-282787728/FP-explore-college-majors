6554894,4,B00M45SW04,"The music is great. The dynamic between the guys is always fun to watch. I had to knock off a star for the video production. As mentioned elsewhere, this is not standard ""Gaither Gospel Series"" material. The usual Gaither production folks did not produce this! The video was produced by IMC, and they need to invest in some tripods or a Steadicam solution. A lot of the tight shots are from handheld cameras, and it shows. Regardless, the family and I really enjoy this project.",1427760000,,478,4.635294117647059

6554900,3,B00M45SW04,"I really wanted to love this DVD. I have followed the Cathedrals for well over 20 years and thought this family reunion was a great idea. I so wanted to hear about all the past members and see a tribute to the ones that have passed, not just George, Glen, and Roger, but Danny Koker and George Amon Webster. What an opportunity for a complete program dedicated the the Ministry of the Cathedrals and all who served in the quartet over the years. I agree with other reviewers that the members that were there were great but would have loved the hear about the others. Also some of the greatest songs were not sung. Would have loved to hear Mark Trammel sing The Master Builder, or Sinner Saved By Grace, I could go on and on.  I think the video is good but I only gave 3 stars because of the missed opportunity to do something as great as the original Cathedrals Reunion in 1995. I like the video and will watch and listen but am so glad I have the VHS of the original Cathedral Reunion.
Also,  I really liked how they handled George's bass part by having 3 guys sing the bass, but would have been nice if they introduced them.
Hopefully they will try again.",1411862400,2,1157,4.302752293577981
6554901,3,B00M45SW04,"The problem here is not the performances. They are excellent. My first complaint is that I am fairly new to Cathedrals. I don't know most of the men performing. They were not identified until the end of the concert. Most of the men on stage were never identified. They are not identified on the DVD case either. Don't ever assume that the audience knows anything about the people and content of a program.

The remaining issues are all technical. Having been involved in video productions, I admit I may be more sensitive to these issues than most viewers.
  1) The sound mix is much too heavy on the band. At times I could barely hear the vocalists. One listens to a Cathedrals concert to hear the Cathedrals--not the drums, piano or guitar.
  2) The lighting is too dramatic. On my video reference monitor, it was hard (at times) to see the difference between the dark suits the men were wearing and the background. Dark backgrounds can be very effective, but not on a video when the performers all are wearing dark clothing.
  3) There was a decided preference for wide camera angles. One needs some of those to establish the setting with a wide shot, but the ""money shot"" is the closeup. That being said, there sere several times that the soloist was not on camera. Easy to do in a live, unrehearsed program. Been there, done that. No excuses here.
  4) Camera work is not up to the standards set by Gaither Music Group.in other programs. Hand-held shots are too shaky, some shots are poorly framed. Transitions mostly OK.

I found myself thinking things like ""Why did they do that?"" or ""That was strange."" Good video production needs to be invisible. If one is thinking negatively about the video production, then the production is failing.",1411084800,3,1745,4.673202614379085

DVD audio and imagery is very good quality, making a highly pleasurable ""stroll"" down memory lane.  The price is okay to, so, if you don't love this one, you must not be a Southern Gospel afficionado!!",1455235200,,290,4.538461538461538
8670161,2,B00M45SW04,"It was OK but I expected better. Several of the past members did not participate or were not invited, e.g., Kirk Talley who wrote many of the great Cathedral hits. To me this was more about four different groups using the Cathedrals fame to sell DVDs. I enjoyed the Mark Trammell Quartet most.",1440720000,,293,4.547169811320755
8670162,5,B00M45SW04,"What a great video for the whole family.  It was wonderful to see these men back together again, singing the grand old message of our Saviour.  It was also wonderful to see the clips of Glen, George, and Roger, as well.  This music is not just for older generations, but for everyone!  Everyone in our family, from age 7 to 60+ loves it.  Every song has a great message, and the messengers do a fantastic job.",1436313600,,409,4.328947368421052
