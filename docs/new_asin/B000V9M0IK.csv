P.S.  Since writing the above on Jan 25 I've seen the DVD, and it is just about as wonderful as seeing the production live.",1201219200,4,356,4.205882352941177
2934028,5,B000V9M0IK,"La Pietra del Paragone:

I'm almost embarrassed to say I experienced this dazzling comedy by Rossini
for the first time only last night.  But having watched this remarkable DVD,
cannot possibly shout from the mountaintops ""Get this DVD!""

Truly, this is - hands down - the most innovative and imaginative staging of
anything in my opera experience, to the point of it being positively revelatory.
The production was designed and directed by Pierrick Sorin - a remarkable
visual artist who fairly found his own medium combining film, optical illusion,
and (according to the accompanying book) ""optical theatres, a blend of
ingenious self-invented contraptions and new technologies which enable him to
appear in space, as if by magic, in the form of a little hologram among real
objects.""  Sorin has done major work/exhibits for a number of galleries and
some of the leading fashion houses.  Still, having read all of that in no way
prepared prepare me for what I was about to see.

For this Chatelet production, Sorin created a television studio with a series of
paneled screens above the actors heads.  The ""studio"" is mostly bare and
employs blue screen technology with the ""sets"" for the production on either
side of the stage.  The sets, such as they are, are dollhouse sized models,
which onstage cameras project the images of onto the screens above.  The
singers move about the mostly bare stage interacting as they normally would,
but their images are superimposed onto the screens above, placing them in
amazing visually resplendent scenery and impossible situations.  As an
example, the Count, appears singing on the burner of a stove - surrounded by
flames only to - during the same aria - appear on a shelf in his refrigerator
complete with icicle stalagmites.  Others scenes involve several of the cast
who actually appear to be swimming, diving, floating on rafts in a ""real"" pool.

All of this is aided by a team of women clad in blue spandex bodysuits,
including their heads and faces who, while visible on the stage are rendered
completely invisible in the images on screen.  This device is employed to
create absolutely mind boggling and hilarious effects, such as the slow motion
flipping of a pancake which later even appears to travel on its own through
space to land on an upheld plate of its ravenous recipient clear across the
kitchen.  The butler/chef later mixes cocktails with moves that rival those of
the finest mixologists.  A tennis tournament played with relish and slow motion
during one of Rossini's most delightful ensembles - all of this and much, much
more to delight and dazzle the eye.  The entire proceedings were then filmed
live at the Chatelet by film director Philippe Beziat, who judiciously moves HIS
cameras up and down, dividing the action in what is at first a dizzying and
slightly confusing experiment, but which - if you give it a few minutes -
settles down and only serves to increase the champagne-like high you'll derive
from this exciting production.

None of this, of course, would matter a whit if not in the service a brilliantly
constructed work - which, as it turns out, happened also to be the 20 year
old Rossini's first commission from La Scala.  It's inconceivable to me that this
remarkable work has hardly been seen or heard in the last century, a little
online investigating showing that there was a recording in 1972 with a young
Carreras, and in the 60's an abridged version showed up at Glyndebourne -
sung in German, and a few other places revived it, but not much more than
that.  Now, there is this vibrant, zany DVD - and another one about to be
released next week of a separate production from Pesaro.  (I'm anxiously
awaiting its arrival!)  The opera itself is a masterpiece.  It does not possess
the depth of story as his most popular comedies, e.g., Cenerentola and
Barbiere - and is, in fact more of an ensemble piece - more so even than
Viaggio.  It is absolutely jammed with delightful, inventive and masterful
ensembles putting its cast of 9 into a variety of configurations.  All of it is
sung here by a young, good looking cast that would be difficult to improve
upon.

The plot - such as it is - involves a visit to the estate of a young, handsome
Count desirous of marriage, but who is pursued by three lovelies, who seem
more interested in his fortune than him.  Also visiting are several men friends,
a poet, a newspaper arts critic, etc. and a houseful of servants.  The
melancholy Count devises a series of ""tests"" and we're treated to the usual
buffa traditions e.g., masked identities, including the count's dressing up as a
Turk and his main object of affection pretending to be a soldier, and his
darling's long lost twin.  It's all laughable - which is precisely why it works!

Bumping the action up to the 1950's works splendidly and lays to rest any
argument that every work must be first seen in its historical context to be
appreciated.  An Italian villa (and environs) in the 1950's helps makes Rossini's
score sound as modern and fresh as if it had been composed last week.  This
is made all the more exciting by the absolutely thrilling playing of the Ensemble
Matheus with Jean-Christophe Spinosi putting everyone through their paces -
often at breakneck speeds that the talented cast has no trouble keeping up
with, relishing even, the alacrity with which Spinosi leads them.  Indeed, I
don't know that I've ever seen a conductor ever having a better time at his
job than young Maestro Spinosi whose excitement practically leaps from the
podium.  Hearing this score played by this original instrument ensemble only
increases my desire to hear them in the entire Rossini oeuvre.  The music
tangibly crackles (and yes that's what I mean!)  There are at least several
numbers that should increase the concert repertoire and the fugue-like
opening of Act II is one of the most creative things I think Rossini ever
penned.

Leading the cast is the handsome, smooth voiced basso Francois Lis (who
looks like a singing Adrian Brody)  and the diminutive contralto Sonia Prima.
Adorable is the only way to describe Ms. Prima.  A cross between the young
Imogene Coca and Carol Burnett, she is a naturally hammy comedienne with a
face of pure rubber, contorting her face from hilarious mugging to seductively
cute in the blink of an eye, all the while hurling out Rossini's nearly impossible
cascades of notes in a variety of coloratura styles; sometimes with
smoothness and lan, and other times more muscularly and aspirated - varying
to suit the needs of the music.  It is nothing less than a perfect performance.

Mr. Lis is new to me and, save a small hurdle there and here, he is a delight.
All are attired in stunning 50's haute couture, including some really creative
bathing suit ensembles for the poolside scene.

The balance of the outstanding cast is:  Jennifer Holloway, Laura Giordano,
Jose Manuel Zapata, Joan Martin -Royo, Christian Senn and Filippo Polinelli -
and what an delightful ensemble all of them make!

Rossini's opera is an undiscovered delight and the Chatelet audience went -
quite rightfully - mad with applause several times, the laughter from the
visuals serving the master's sparkling, infinitely inventive score.  I only hope
this charmer finds itself being produced stateside - and soon!

Everything about this is first class, including the housing of the DVD(s).  The
opera is on a single disc (running a little over 2:40) with a separate disc
including interviews.  The discs are housed in a hardcover bound 116 page
book loaded with production photos, plot synopsis, articles about the opera
and Rossini, interviews with conductor, designer, and biographies of everyone
involved (it weighs over a pound!).  The product is put out by na've label and
is perhaps the most fun I never expected to have from a DVD!  I cannot
recommend this highly enough!

Bravo, Bravissimo to all of the forces involved in recreating this ""lost""
masterpiece at the Chatelet!

2934029,5,B000V9M0IK,"Rossini and Corsetti take flight. This was Rossini's real debut, as a full opera at La Scala. It has been pretty well forgotten until now when not one but 2 DVDs are appearing. Previously it was only represented on CD by a recording with Carreras and Diaz. Rossini here is in full comic flair. Everything we love in his comedies is present in abundance. He may perfect his many tricks, but he will never be as fresh as in this youthful farce. The cast and conductor are on top of it. And the director Corsetti makes it literally take off. He mixes live and video here to magical effect. Below the singers are in front of bluescreens; above they frolic in the many scenes - raninging from swimming pool to desert. The plot is flimsy and very complicated. So lay back and let Rossini tickle you and Corsetti leave you gasping - how can he do that? All the tricks are right there in front of us, but they are still breathtaking. You've never seen anything like this before. And you'll probably never see an opera done like this again. I don't know what the other recording is like. But I'm sure unlike this production, it is earthbound.",1198972800,21,1133,4.451923076923077
2934030,5,B000V9M0IK,"If you're a fan of Rossini comedies in general, or particularly a fan of inventive modern productions, this DVD is for you. Directed by Pierrick Sorin, who had previously created imaginative, moving scale-model sets for department store windows, this production split-screens the action with the aid of six cameras, props manipulators in blue suits against a blue background, and scenery that changes as rapidly as the frame-by-frame backgrounds of a Krazy Kat cartoon. If this seems a bit much for you, then by all means stay away; but I for one laughed uproariously at the incongruity of the changing scenery, in front of which a cast of mostly young and not well-known singers cavort like cartoon characters themselves.

The entire cast is superb, but pride of place goes to Sonia Prina, who sings Marchese Clarice. She is a pip and a half...a small woman, she appears to be no taller than 5 foot 3, and she looks a little like Imogene Coca, but omigod what a voice!! She has a fluent contralto that rattles through Rossini's most tongue-twisting cadenzas with lightning speed, interpretation, humor, and a tone that stays perfectly even from top to bottom. But tenor Jose Zapata and baritones Christian Senn and Joan Martin-Royo are right behind her, and bass Francois Lis as Count Asdrubale has a wonderfully distinctive dark timbre that is quite unusual for this kind of music.

If you enjoy the films of Jacques Tati or Georges Melies, you'll love this one. Don't, don't pass it up!! Get it now, put it in your DVD player, and get ready to be amazed as well as to laugh til you drop!",1198540800,24,1590,4.778181818181818

8217466,5,B000V9M0IK,"It's set in the 1930s or so, which sometimes can be annoying.  But it works.  In addition to perfectly executed opera, we are treated to the production process of matting and insertion of live singers placed into models of sets.  Some people might find this annoying, but I quite enjoyed it.  Purely by coincidence, I was playing this DVD while my wife was staying a block from Th&eacute;tre du Chtelet in Paris, where this DVD was shot.  We don't know if she was attending the theater at the same time I was playing this opera, but it adds a bit of fun for us.

And, of course, it's Rossini and that means wonderful music by default and a jolly good time.",1398038400,,656,4.380165289256198
8217467,5,B000V9M0IK,"What is it that make you keep coming back for a fix of 'Pietra' every so often? Premiered when Rossini was just 20 so obviously written before that age, it has a vivacity and youthfulness that is just captivating. Probably I think his most 'Mozartian' opera.  I have this and the other DVD from the Teatro Real in Madrid - but this performance is so engaging that I always end up watching this one when I get that 'Pietra' itch.  That's not to downplay the Madrid production - it's excellent with a smart 1950's dolce vita style adaptation and with Raul Giminez as Gioconda in excellent form (the bonus interviews are worth watching).  But this Ensemble Matheus production is quite unique.  I think what makes a big difference is the fact that the singer/actors are often in close-up shots so facial expressions interplay with the music/story and add to the charm of the piece.  The Clarice in this production (Sonia Prina) is just a real darling - competent, mischievous and very convincing. I love the Buster Keaton waiter character who wanders in and out! but there are some slowish parts (hey he's only 20 odd!) with Macrobio the journalist (an accurate prescient of the fickleness of modern day tabloid press) and Pacuvio the noisome amateur poet - but that aside its a piece that always leaves you in a good mood. The conduct and joy of the orchestra couldn't be more energetic and played on mostly period instruments it must be a fairly accurate rendition what the 1812 audience would have heard.",1379808000,,1503,4.721374045801527
8217468,5,B000V9M0IK,"This 2007 presentation of Rossini's early operatic success, La Pietra del Paragone', is a total success in my opinion but strictly on its own unique terms. Although Rossini was only 25 at the time of writing it, you would never know from its highly skilful vocal and instrumental writing or its dramatic setting. it was very popular with contemporary audiences.

The current conductor, Jean-Christophe Spinosi, feels passionately that this is no less than a masterpiece and establishes his point of view in a detailed interview under the bonus section of this presentation. There is also a detailed interview with the creator of the video techniques used. It is these that will make or break this recording for most purchasers. Another unusual feature of this presentation is the 116 page book, (half in French and half in English), which goes into numerous aspects of the music, the musicians, the production and the technicians in considerable detail.

As regards the conductor and the orchestra, what we have here is an impassioned delivery of the music on original instruments. This allows for correct balancing and textures as envisioned by Rossini and every tiny detail of phrasing and dynamics is scrupulously observed, sometimes at breakneck speeds, all of which are executed with jaw-dropping brilliance by the singers as well as the instrumentalists.

All the singers are truly outstanding. It is a young team who were particularly flexible in terms of the production requirements which demanded tremendous capability in terms of facial expression. Sonia Prina as Clarisa has a highly developed sense of humour, which coupled with a dazzling vocal technique, makes her beyond compare in my opinion. Not far behind are Joan Martin-Royo as Macrobio and Laura Giordano as Fulva to rather unfairly single out just a couple more. Suffice it to say that the whole cast is on an equally exalted plane.

The production has been conceived as a combination of small models of houses and artefacts with a range of close video cameras working in conjunction with another set of video cameras focusing on the singers. This enables trick photography to occur by superimposing one over another. So, by way of example, the count is seen sitting on a banana seat in his garden achieved simply by blending the count's video with that of the banana etc. The blended images are displayed on banks of large video screens behind and above the singers which enables the audience to see how it is done at the same time as seeing the result. This allows much greater facial acting than would otherwise be possible as well as countless other effects. The none-singing role of the waiter is a constantly diverting and amusing side-play.

Does this work? The audience seemed to enjoy it and the production was a great success in that respect. I personally liked it very much and have enjoyed it on repeated viewings. My wife is not so keen and finds it distracting. I would not wish this to become the preferred way of watching many operas either. But on this occasion I find it adds greatly to my enjoyment.

The sound is presented in stereo only but this may be more appropriate to the inevitably reduced live sound stage. Either way I found my ears rapidly adjusted. The visual side is essentially trickery so normal comments about imaging and camera work simply do not apply.

For me, on this one occasion, I would rate it as a 5 star experience. The Gramophone Magazine also favoured it upon release and I would not count that particular magazine as innately revolutionary or avant garde in general terms. My wife would not be so kind. This particular recording is therefore bound to be a very much more a matter of personal taste than usual and therefore beyond the scope of a review such as this. On this occasion the above must simply be seen as an attempt to give the flavour of a very unusual presentation which is likely to appeal, or not to appeal, equally strongly to potential purchasers.",1342915200,,3984,4.884615384615385
8217469,5,B000V9M0IK,"Let me begin with a humble confession. I'm one of those cultural barbarians that has always made fun of opera, and never thought I'd see the day where I'd have a positive word to say about it.  Well that day has come.

By chance, I stumbled across the innovative performance directed by Pierrick Sorin and conducted by Jean-Christophe Spinosi.  And this repentant reviewer humbly acknowledges that he was completely captivated from start to finish.  Admittedly, I'm not qualified to give profound analysis on the technical merits of the singing or other aspects of production.  But I do know that I liked what I saw, and if a performance of opera has the power to make a convert from an unbeliever such as I was, that says volumes about it.

The opera itself has been a success ever since its first performance in 1812.  Set in the 19th century country villa of Count Asdrubale, ""La pietra del paragone"" recounts the count's plan to test the sincerity of three ladies who are rivals for his love, in order to determine whether they simply aspire to get their hands on his wealth.  Asdrubale carries out a clever plan to test the genuineness of their affections by pretending to have been financially ruined.  After Clarice's love holds firm and passes the test, she decides to test the count in return, by appearing in disguise as her brother, with the news that his sister will never again appear.  After the count is distraught, Clarice reveals her true identity, and the opera concludes with a celebratory feast.

But what makes this particular performance stand out is something more than just a good story.  This production recasts the opera into the era of the 1950s, and has singers performing in front of three cameras set in a plain blue background, and the live action is superimposed onto simultaneous filming of small models that represent the setting.  Cast members in blue morph suits appear invisible on the giant screen which pictures the final result, and this enables them to achieve all kinds of special effects, and heightens the exaggerated and wonderful facial expressions - which are superbly executed by the performers.  The result is outstandingly creative, and enables some of the singers to appear as if they are seated on a giant banana or tennis ball, or in conflicting emotions represented by the cold of a refrigerator or the heat of a stove burner.

It really needs to be seen to be believed, and if you're like me, it will at times leave you astonished and open-mouthed at the creativity on display.  Some of the more memorable scenes achieved with this clever use of technology include a butler athletically flipping a pancake in slow motion, and protagonists singing in a swimming pool.  It's positively brilliant, and despite my apparent dislike for opera, I was riveted and completely spellbound by the creative genius on display.  Bravo! - GODLY GADFLY",1327276800,,2890,4.863265306122449
8217470,3,B000V9M0IK,"What a shame to put experimental video-technique together with this wonderful opera! This is possibly one of the best Rossini operas, with several of his famous ""crescendo""-s; it is sung by great voices, accompanied by a spirited orchestra, which is conducted by a very knowledgeable young conductor. In brief, the opera has everything going for it - except the poorly executed video experimemntation.

As we learned, the director of the Chatelet Theatre invited a so-called ""artist"", who got his name to fame by mounting Christmas windows at the Galeries Lafayette. His arrangement was to have small-scale models done and use video-projection of the models unto a large screen in the shop window.

Thus the opera is produced without the scenery, which is replaced by small-scale models. Video cameras film the models, while other video cameras film the singers in front of a blank [blue] background. The two images then combined electronically and projected on a screen above the heads of the singers. This sytem seems to work most of the time, but not always, thus it badly disrupts the opera. The theatre audience always sees both the singers singing in front of the blank background, the support personal manipulating the scenery models, and the combination image with the model scenery above the singer's head. The fiming however is done by jumping the images from close-ups of the singers to the sometimes poorly working projection above their head. It was interesting for the first 10 minutes, after that it was tiresome - you had to close your eyes to enjoy the fantastic opera. Think before you buy it!",1265328000,8,1611,5.0299625468164795
8217471,5,B000V9M0IK,"Not only do we have great music by a most inventive composer, Rossini- it is produced by a group of a wonderfully inventive production team, dripping with inventive talent. No expense was spared in this production. The first surprise when you receive it, is that it is not in a flimsy jewel case, or fragile box-but is packaged in a hard cover book! Inside are highest quality photos, and thorough historical notes that place this happy work in context. I have never seen a more thorough treatment of an opera in my life. Words are not enough to express all that you will find here. I have to say that the two principle love objects are beyond superb. I have no doubt at all that you will see and hear more from each of them. Sonia Prina-who portrays the only woman with a sincere heart in this romantic romp- is adorable! This DVD is worth the price alone for her performance. ( Incidentally, this production has  a price that is very reasonable compared to the ridiculously overpriced boxed audio only sets from Opera Rara. Take a hint, Opera Rara- those sets are way overpriced, when you realize you can get a DVD performance and a stunning book with the visual show, such as this one for half the cost of an Opera Rara audio only edition. ) You will fall in love with Sonia Prina too. There is a lot of silliness and mawkish ( overly sentimental ) mugging; but this is why it is so endearing. When we see an old Charlie Chaplin film, we encounter a lot of the same overacting absurdity. This sort of convoluted absurdity had the same purpose early in the 1800's as Chaplin's works had-which was mainly to distract from the more grave socio/economic/wartime darknesses on the horizon then as now. Even if you find yourself profoundly annoyed by the overacting, it has already acheived its purpose-to distract you from world events that are far more disturbing. Hence, the Chaplinesque clowning around stupidity.
I must insert here how keen was  Rossini's perception of human behavior at this early age  ( in his 20's ? ) of composing. We see here his life long irreverence for hoighty toighty sycophancy which he maintains throughout his career. We see it again in the Cinderella story, and in Puccini's ""Gianni Schichi""...flattering self seeking suck ups pretending sorrow at a funeral of a rich relative hoping to grab a big chunk of that money. This opera and Il Viaggio a Reims, and Gianni Schichi, all point to the ugliest aspect of human nature in the entire world -  sucking up to someone rich and powrful, and abandoning them to poverty the instant you discover they have lost their fortune! This is still with us today. One only has to turn on any TV show to see it in spades. Think of ""The Bachelor"" when they chose a working stiff and presented him as fabulously wealthy, and brought in the bimbos to cat fight over him...only to discover that they had all made gigantic fools of themselves before millions of viewers. But does this stop bimbos from stabbing each other in the back for the rich guy? Absolutely not. The really deplorable thing?..you will find this behavior in just about any large church ...people thinking they are taking on an aura of 'goodness', while all they are thinking about is being in the 'inner circle' concerned about who they are seen with, what they are wearing and driving and where they live-thinking they are 'advancing their token to boardwalk' by joining the 'richest church in town'! Any TV show...any church...there you will find this behavior so comically displayed here in this opera...only it isn't a damn bit funny, is it?
 The fabulous printed matter helps us understand all this much better. My sincere hope is that opera productions in future will take a cue from this production here. It is revolutionary. The entire genre can only benefit from such a deluge of talent like this. This edition will increase in value over time. You may find numerous things you would do differently. In my case, I would not show so much 'how this thing is done technically', with stage hands clearly standing or moving about with props. And also when the singers are distant from the microphones, it is way too obvious...they sound distant and hollow. All this is way too distracting from an otherwise good performance by the players. I also like the tenor role of Giocondo, played by Jose Zapata ( Joe Shoe ). He has a beautiful voice, which gets quite lost among all the zany antics, and distracting stage hand stuff. He deserves a serious role, and so does Sonia Prina, with the enormously pleasant contralto voice she has, along with her stupendous acting abilities. You might hate this at first...but you will watch it again, I'm sure. I did, in spite of my objections.

addition months later...I like it even more. Unfortunately, my copy freezes.. i will be lookign for another copy to replace this one. this opera is a keeper. let it be known we demand more sonia Prina. although her specialty is music of the Baroque era...and I am a hopeless romantic...perhaps I'll start collecting baroque operas if Sonia is in them.",1230940800,3,5069,4.696287964004499

I expected it to be fun, but it transcends any opera buffa staging I've ever seen for novelty, for incredible ensemble acting, for visual surprises, and for stunning vocal athleticism. Sonia Prina, the leading lady and briefly her own twin brother, is a miracle. I've heard her often enough in oratorio and cantata performances, especially of Alessandro Scarlatti, but I had no idea she could ham it up on stage and on overhead projection simultaneously while singing bel canto with consummate precision. If you've heard Rossini, you know you'll get at least one quartet or quintet with one singer expectorating 500 syllables a minute, another soaring in coloratura, a bass exclaming vehemently, and a tenor rhapsodizing eloquently. In this opera you get five such ensembles, each more improbable and magical than the last! Now that this gem has been rediscovered, believe me, it will be coming to an opera house near you soon.

The previous reviewers have done La Pietra del Paragone justice with unanimous praise, and offered plenty of detail to help you realize that you NEED to order this DVD before bedtime tonight.
