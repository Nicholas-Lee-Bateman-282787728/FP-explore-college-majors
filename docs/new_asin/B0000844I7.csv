Everytime he sees her he begins to blush and can't speak straight!  Too bad Sakura is so clueless to the obvious attraction Shoaran has for her!  There is no fooling Tomoyo, though!  Then, with Eriol in the picture it creates some conflict for kawii Shoaran!  I advise all Cardcaptor Sakura Fans to buy this volume today!  THe show rocks!",1043366400,7,472,4.753086419753086

7979095,4,B0000844I7,"in this sakura discovers than now that the key/ wand  has changed the spell to turn the key and the cards must change. the cards must now draw there power from her instead of clow reed and now her task is to turn the clow cards into sakura cards. the new transfer student eriol we have learned that he was once clow reed. the only question is why is he doing all of this, is it to test sakura's worthiness to be the master of the cards or some other reason, and it looks like he has sun and moon helpers too.",1375056000,,508,3.980392156862745
7979096,5,B0000844I7,this anime just keeps getting better & better you have to just keep watching it. it keeps getting more & more spicy!~,1367107200,,117,4.363636363636363
7979097,4,B0000844I7,"Sad but true - with these volumes the wonderful ride that is Cardcaptor Sakura is rapidly drawing to its inexorable conclusion.  One feature of this journey no one seems to have commented on, however - especially reviewers who find this arc slower or otherwise disappointing compared to the previous ones - is that it is even more faithful to its original source in the manga by the all-female group CLAMP.  The first 6 volumes of the manga concerned Sakura's ""capture"" of the errant Clow Cards, arguably the most interesting feature of the plot.  Nanase Okawa of CLAMP and studio Madhouse wisely decided to extend this half of the entire series into what is really two-thirds of the anime by including over twice as many captures as occur in the books; yet no one seems to have complained about this lengthening through what might be termed so many ""filler"" episodes.

By contrast, the seemingly-condensed Sakura/Star Cards arc contains little that does not appear in the final 6 volumes of the manga.  If it seemes repetetive or derivative from the earlier arcs, well it is!  Yet, to Okawa's credit as author of the script, the remarkable character development this series is noted for continues throughout this section ( and into the final movie ) as well.  Though I rather wish there had been more mystery as to the ""true"" identetity of Sakura's latest antagonists, at least their motives remain unclear; and it is still enjoyable watching circumstances unfold for our young Heroine.",1263945600,,1487,4.924
7979098,4,B0000844I7,I liked this series much better than Cardcaptors.  It made a lot more sense and all of the sub-plots were there.,1197504000,,112,4.333333333333333
7979099,5,B0000844I7,"I think that an anime like Card Captor Sakura would just feel like your normal predictible mahou-shoujo anime if it had been produced any other way.

CCS really rose above those limits and created something entirely original, and I can't stress that enough.

Anyway, about this DVD, it saddens me that the series is starting to draw to a close now.

These episodes weren't my very favorites because I really liked the whole little rivalry between Syaoran and Sakura for Yukito.

But oh well, it had to happen sometime.

Hope you enjoy this series as much as I do.",1139529600,,563,4.646464646464646
7979100,3,B0000844I7,"In Cardcaptor Sakura: Vol. 13: Star Cards, we see Sakura getting more powerful and confident as she comes into being a sorceress of her own.  Volume thirteen contains four episodes:

Ep. 48 ""Sakura and the Awakened Key of Star"" - It is raining nonstop.  Mysteriously unable to transform her key to her power wand, Sakura is frustrated.  Her new charming friend Eriol takes her mind off her troubles while Shaoran simmers with jealousy.  Kero feels uneasy about a strange yet familiar presence.  Sakura and her friends are trapped in water funnels and in danger of drowning as Sakura still cannot use her powers.  This episode is the only one on this disc with great action.

Ep. 49 ""Sakura and the Dangerous Piano"" - Tomoyo the singing sensation is chased by a . . . piano.  Snore!

Ep. 50 ""Sakura and the Invisible Threads"" - Sakura and her school friends want to sew teddy bears to give to their crushes.  Eriol helps Sakura sew hers, and she excitedly prepares to give it to Yukito.

Ep. 51 ""Sakura and the Huge Stuffed Animal"" - Sakura goes to give her bear to Yukito, but it gets . . . big and stomps on stuff . . . yeah. (boring)  At the end of the episode, we learn who the enemy is who has been causing trouble for our heroine.

The series is coming to a close.  There are only two volumes left after this disc.  The series has turned from Li and Sakura focusing on Yukito to Li falling in love with Sakura.  For viewers like myself who enjoyed the Sakura-Yukito connection, this disc and the ones that follow might be anticlimactic.",1126396800,3,1541,4.465949820788531
7979101,5,B0000844I7,Ok one of the animes im obseed with is cardcaptor sakura cause theres no edits cuts or badly dubbes well its only avalible in japanese but i prefer subs over dubs. I don't have this but im getting episodes 1-70 on dvd.,1073088000,,218,4.214285714285714
7979102,4,B0000844I7,"This DVD starts the final run of this popular TV show.
In this disc, we see Sakura figure out the mystery of the non-working Clow cards as well as the emergence of a new villain.
As usual, this show is just great.  The characters are fleshed out and interesting and the show looks and sounds spectacular.  It's a series that just does everything pretty good (art, story, humor, romance).
My only complaint is that this new story arc feels rather forced as if the producers said ""We're popular, let's drag it out a little bit!"".  Some of the battles that take place seem pretty derivative from the first 2/3 of the show.
If you've watched the show so far, you'll continue to enjoy it with this DVD.",1044316800,,697,4.47244094488189
7979103,5,B0000844I7,"I love Cardcaptor Sakura, I can't emphasize that enough. Li grows more and more jealous when he notices Eriol growing closer to Sakura. Even more confusing is the fact that he can't understand why he has the same feelings for Yukito when suddenly Yue arrives and gives him a short brief lesson on love, of all people (^_^). Meanwhile, Eriol continues to test Sakura, forcing her to change the Clow Cards to Sakura Cards using her own magic. Unfortunately, this leaves her in a lethargy state and her guardian Yue to grow weaker and lose more and more of her powers. Want to find out more, buy Cardcaptor Sakura.",1044057600,5,611,4.614678899082569
