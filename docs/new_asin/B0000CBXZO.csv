7998858,4,B0000CBXZO,"I obtained this DVD from a different source than Amazon, but enjoy it nonetheless.  Oddly, it's main purpose is to lull me to sleep when I'm wanting to doze off to something wistful, tropical, and soothingly narrated (in anticipation of a future trip to the islands).  For that I'm giving it 4 stars.

If I truly wanted to learn about the islands in great detail, however, especially from a more younger/adventure-seeking perspective, this would not be the DVD I'd watch - I'd find something far more inclusive that more accurately reflects the reality of what you'll actually be experiencing during a visit if you're planing on a lot of physical activity or nightlife.  From a younger, more adventure-seeking and nightlife perspective, I would drop this DVD to 2 stars and find something more suitable.

The sound quality is pretty average for an 11-year old DVD.  The video quality, however, is pretty predictable since it was all shot in 4:3 standard definition because HD video cameras were not yet in general use.  Had it been shot in HD, I personally would have given this review 5 stars.

The woman who narrates this DVD does so extremely well, and you couldn't have a more sweet and relaxed tour guide for this DVD.  She is excellent in her ability to verbally communicate a non-stop smile throughout the entire DVD.  Though one reviewer complains that it comes off as someone reading you a children's book about the islands, which is fairly accurate, it is one of the reasons I thoroughly enjoy this DVD.  It's just yet another way the islands have found a way to whisper sweet and tranquil things in my ear.  :-)

This DVD is excellent for a relaxed general tour of the Hawaii and Tahitian islands, and is surprisingly inclusive of all of the islands that you may have never even heard of before.",1466726400,,1806,4.731629392971246
7998859,5,B0000CBXZO,I totally enjoyed this DVD!!  We are planning a trip to Tahiti and Hawaii next January and this gave us a preview of what to expect.  Loved the video!!,1392854400,,151,4.172413793103448
7998860,3,B0000CBXZO,"This is a pretty good quick overview of a lot of islands in Hawaii and French Polynesia.  On the plus side, there is some very nice photography, occasionally gorgeous. The material is varied enough to give you a good feel for each island - you can clearly sense the differences between them.  The material is organized by island which is convenient, though if you watch this through, there is repetition.  For example, many of them feature good snorkeling, and that activity is covered in a very similar way across the board.

On the down side, the narrator is insipid. She sounds like a storyteller on a 1950s kiddie record. Almost condescending, and overflowing with gushing descriptions that sound nicked from old-fashioned puffery. The content focuses on scenery and some island culture (e.g. pearls & pineapples), which I liked. However, there is almost nothing about resorts, shopping, night life, transportation.  The major attractions are covered, such as volcanoes, Bishop Museum, 4x4 tours, but as another reviewer commented, it feels geared toward the seasoned citizen.  The music is old royalty free stuff you've heard in your home movie software.  Aside from some coverage of Father Damien, there is not much information here - just a breezy gloss.  The featurette on top 10 activities was pretty random. As they count down towards Number One you wonder what criteria they used to rate the activities. Doesn't matter - it's the same footage you've seen from the rest of the program.

Overall I enjoyed this, and will watch again the parts on islands of personal interest.  Despite the shortcomings, it is very alluring - you can almost smell the tradewinds as they caress you with perfumes of plumeria and frangipani - which I thought were the same thing, but now I'm sounding like the narrator.",1334188800,2,1808,4.996666666666667
7998861,3,B0000CBXZO,"This is a fair DVD travel video that looks at Hawaii and Tahiti. It spends about 10 minutes on each island giving a quick overview.

It seems that this product falls short in both video quality and what they highlight.

The quality is at time 'good' and at others to be rather 'poor', washed out and muted. I checked various shots from the DVD aginst other material and found dramatic differences in the richness and color. Having lived in or vistited all of the Hawaiian Islands, I noticed this problem the first time I watched the DVD.

Their choice of what they covered is also aimed at a 65+ viewer, lots of glass bottom boats, churches, and 'educational' tours. Light on the beaches, surfing, adventure, and FUN!

On Hawaii (the Big Island), they never show you any of the great Kohola beaches and resorts! Not Hapuna beach, Mona Kea beach, or A-beach, all great beaches! This is what most visitors spend much of their time at, not the Painted Church or the Jager reserch center.

The half of the DVD dealing with Tahiti has better video quality and seems more helpfull.

Overall score: C

7998862,5,B0000CBXZO,"Despite the title ""Cruise Hawaii & Tahiti"", the DVD actually tells you nothing about cruising the islands.  For me, that was OK because I didn't care about that; if you do, you will be disappointed.
However, if you are looking for a comprehensive description of sights worth seeing, this is a good DVD.
I have only previously traveled to The Big Island, Oahu, and Kauai.  For each of those islands, the DVD did a great job of covering all the highlights I had seen, and some besides.
The DVD also covers Lanai, Molokai, and Maui in the Hawaiian chain.
It covers Tahiti, Moorea, Huahine, Raiatea (and quick mention of Tahaa), and Bora Bora from the Society Island chain of French Polynesia, and Rangiroa in the Tuamotus.
Since I haven't been to any of those yet (I'll have done that after this Fall), I can't vouch for how thorough they were covered, but based on the three islands that I can compare to, I think they've done a good job.
The DVD does not cover practical travel tips, such as transportation, hotels, dining, currency, and such.  If you want one of those, go check out the Globe Trekker series.
---- UPDATE ----
Have returned from my trip to Tahiti, Moorea, Huahine, Raiatea, Taha'a, Bora Bora, Maupiti, and Rangiroa.
Looked at this DVD again after returning home, and can confirm that it does a pretty good job of covering the sights in the Society Islands and Rangiroa (but, as stated before, no practical traveler info).",1089504000,12,1437,4.67193675889328
