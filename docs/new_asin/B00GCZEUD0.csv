8622204,5,B00GCZEUD0,"I am was totally addicted to Rock and Roll Christian music and thought there was nothing wrong with it. This DVD set has enlightened and made aware that music that has the name Jesus in it does not make it Christian music. What makes it Christian and spiritual is the beat. For music to be right it must have Melody (God the father), Harmony (Jesus Christ) and Beat (The Holy Spirit). When you change the beat 1-3 and change it to 2-4, you change it from spiritual to a  satanic beat (2-4). I did not know this. Now I know why such wild dancing occurs in churches etc. I love this 5 DVD seminar as it taught me a lot and now have removed many 2-4 style CDs etc from my library and I am now more aware of what to listen to when worshipping God.",1413244800,,743,4.089041095890411

8622207,5,B00GCZEUD0,The best music seminar! This is actually my second time to buy this DVD set because I gave the first to my father in Manila. He loved it a lot and I had to order one again for myself. This will save your family from choosing the wrong kinds of music which will affect their moral choices in life!,1396396800,4,296,4.033898305084746
