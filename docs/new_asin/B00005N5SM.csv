1628285,5,B00005N5SM,"When this series first aired on PBS in America, I was on the slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro in Tanzania climbing to the summit. After spending three weeks in East Africa I was very anxious to watch this series and purchased it upon returning home. I wanted to see how close did it come to representing  the Africa that I had just experienced. Did it ignore social issues one experiences when visiting Africa? Would it just serve as PR for people to go on safaris and visit tourist sites in Africa? I was not disappointed. This series is a fantastic portrait of Africa today. It does a great job telling the story of how people live their daily lives and the challenges they face today and likely will in the future. The natural beauty and wildlife of Africa are stunning, and this series brings it all into your living room. When I was there I witnessed deforestation first-hand and saw how the natural world is in direct competition with the human world for resources.  This series doesn't gloss over these kinds of issues. The music and production of the series are first rate, I also bought the soundtrack CD. If you want to see what Africa today is really like, watch this series.",1018742400,27,1178,4.55188679245283
1628286,1,B00005N5SM,"This is not a prof. production, except for the narration. Fair sharpness only with nervous cam. work. So this ""private -video"" is not  price-worthy!",1011744000,,148,5.166666666666667
1628287,5,B00005N5SM,"This series is absolutely stunning in many ways. First and foremost, the cinematography is breathtaking, from the verist handheld shots to the almost abstract compositions of aerial 90 degree and macro shots. Ron Fricke's Baraka has had a lot of influence on the documentary genre, and there are plenty of Baraka-type moments in here, with assorted new age-ish world music pastiches to support them.
But show is not all there is. The script is beautifully written, with just the right balance between narration and interviews, and editing that lets the product breathe, and the viewer reflect. The agility with which the episodes branch out from the story of individuals to natural, historical, social and cultural references is impressive. And amazingly, you never loose touch with reality, since the documentary's transcendence lies upon the day-to-day lives and thoughts of its subjects.
You also feel the respect the crews had for their subjects, and the making of bonus shows it well. Ethnological research ethics are respected, in a world where ethical rules towards the Other are too often pushed aside by the greed of producers and researchers.
All in all an amazing document to be viewed over and over again. This is one boxset I highly recommend.",999907200,86,1256,5.131707317073171
1628298,4,B00005N5SM,"I have been to Africa...and outside of actually being there, this is the next best thing.  I leave one star out-only out of malice for NOT actually being there.  It's kind of like going to the zoo-after being in Africa.  Nothing realted is the same-on video...or encased in zoo cages.  But it is a awesom trip none the less...and I highly recommend this flick!",1231286400,,360,4.578125
1628299,3,B00005N5SM,"After reading all of the glowing reviews I couldn't wait to watch the series. Unfortunately, it was a little disappointing. Visually it is stunning and offers a broad view of the vast continent. The problem is in the narration. Ugh! While viewing some of the most exciting scenery in the world and gaining some insight into the many cultures of Africa the narrator seems determined to put the viewer to sleep. And rather than give the viewer a real taste of the local music, whenever someone bursts into song, whether in a children's game or at a funeral, they have chosen to pipe in some over-produced studio version of ""African"" music that is full of western influences. Indiginous African music is so beautiful in its rawest form; don't insult your audience by assuming that we can't appreciate music that hasn't been cleaned up and westernized.",1196294400,16,848,4.855172413793103
1628300,5,B00005N5SM,". . . I have just begun to view this series via NETFLIX, and if the first disc is indicitive of the rest of the series then this is something i will be sure to purchase. As i cannot honestly review the series in it's entirety, this ""review"" is to make clear that despite any misprint here on amazon or on the packaging -(don't have the box so i can't say)- this series IS in full 16X9 anamorphic widescreen - it does state as much on the discs themselves. many people, like myself, will not buy/rent dvds if the aspect ratio is not preserved on disc. For those concered; have no fear, it's in gorgeous widescreen. 5-stars for disc 1 and the beautiful transfer",1158796800,13,659,4.32258064516129
1628301,4,B00005N5SM,"Beautifully photographed.  However, if you're interested in Africa from a political and historical standpoint, as I am, this is not really the video series for you.

Excellent wildlife and nature footage (just as you'd expect from National Geographic) and even an attempt to convey some sociological lessons about ""urban"" vs. ""tribal"" differences.

Overall, well worth watching, but don't look to it for very deep historical or political enlightenment about the continent.",1130544000,50,472,5.619718309859155
1628302,5,B00005N5SM,"To know a country is to know its people. Previously apart from South Africa, Africa was a homongenous blur to me. This series looks at the different regions of the continent through the eyes of the people who live out their lives there. It contrasts the traditional ways with the ways of change giving both a glimpse into the past and into the future. The flora and forna also feature but are featured more to show the struggle to survive in different habitats and a changing world.",1123632000,22,482,4.551724137931035
1628303,5,B00005N5SM,"Irresistible vignettes depict real Africans carrying out their life journeys presented in an intimate and compelling fashion.  Eight stories (2 per disk) from divergent geographic and cultural settings illuminate the breadth and diversity of people who call this continent home.

I teach world history to students whose world view will be forever changed as a result of seeing these educational works of insight and beauty.

1628305,5,B00005N5SM,"Two Words. National Geographic. I subscribed to the magazine, saw the atlas, and rented the movies at the Anna Lemmon Wheelock Library in Tacoma very frequently. National Geographic took us through the enchanted Amazon, and great cities like Rome, Baghdad, and Sydney. They took us through the terrifing wars of Iraq and explored the top of K2 and Mount Everest. They did documentaries on cats, tigers, lions, lizards, and traveled with Steve Irwin through Australia. Now they take on the biggest challenge yet. AFRICA ""GOD'S GIFT"".
  I call Africa ""God's Gift"" because in my prospective, he did something special with it. Every continent has something special to it but Africa has a little bit more. It was featured on CBS's ""Survivor Africa"" as they went through exciting challenges and tasks in Kenya. The northern part of Africa, now in a country called ""Egypt"", had ancient lands in early times. The people built sphinxs, prymids and had very hard jobs which they did for most of the day for little or no pay.
  National Geographic did their best for this and accomplished their mission at the same time. Their mission for ""Africa"" was to get a television special and feature Africa's best features. I can definatley tell you, that if you want to see something neat and experiance Africa at the same time, this is for you.
  Don't get overeactive about this it is a great special but, you shouldn't get carried away. OK maybye you can get carried away. It's wonderful without a doubt and shows everything about this splendid continent.
  Give it a try. Go ahead!
  Have a good life America!,

1628306,5,B00005N5SM,"This DVD series uses a refreshing and unique way to tell the story of the people, places and animals of Africa.  The personal stories were touching, the landscapes were breathtaking and the close up on the animals was just amazing.
I was very happy to see a series that did not just identify what's wrong with Africa, but took the time to tell us so much of what is right and is worth saving and exploring.  Timely indeed!!!
In so many ways this was more than just a documentary.  This in-depth and honest look probably saved all the other documentaries or books that are about Africa.
I am glad to see that so many Africans are proud of their culture, many preserve it in so many ways and yet realize that some changes are necessary to keep pace in a global environment.
Thanks to all the wonderful people from the different countries on that beautiful continent that allowed me to peek into their lives.  I am eternally grateful.  Thanks also to the wonderful crew that did all the work to bring such remarkable stories into my living room.  It was well worth the hard work.  It was just wonderfully touching!!!",1032739200,13,1113,4.535
1628307,5,B00005N5SM,"From the technical point of view, the images are crisp and the sound is excellent. However, this series was shot on film, so we're missing 24fps on the DVD format (maybe they'll re-release this on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD?)

Second issue is, this compilation has no extras except the 1-hour ""bonus"" making-off, and some web links. Where are the directors' commentary?  Where are the multiple languages?  The whole series doesn't even have subtitle? This is such a shame. If you have seen an IMAX DVD before, you know what I mean, they pack so much extras into their DVDs, like 4-5 languages, closed captioned for the Hearing Impaired, trailers etc.

Africa is a wonderful collection, only marred by its lack of extras that are essential in special-collection DVDs.",1029024000,11,757,4.937007874015748

7946277,5,B00005N5SM,"This video series is stunning, but don't miss the companion book by John Reader. He also wrote great book on Africa which came out before the National Geographic series, so you might give it a try: http://www.amazon.com/Africa-Biography-Continent-John-Reader/dp/067973869X.

The only minor quibble I have is that they used the same Lisa Gerrard song in back-to-back episodes. Since I was glued to the sofa I did see those episodes in one sitting, and therefore that song (which is one of my all-time music faves) did seem to be over-used. More Lisa Gerrard and Dead Can Dance music, plus a track from Run Lola Run, are used to good effect.

If you love the Planet Earth series, watch Africa.",1298246400,2,691,4.948275862068965
7946278,1,B00005N5SM,"Having seen only Episode 1, it is certainly well-intentioned, and is respectful of its subjects, both in Kenya and Tanzania. But two ongoing themes of the program are a) the age-old importance of land and b) the timelessness of the African people.

Concerning a) this is for the most part a fundamental misreading of African peoples across the continent, reflecting a Eurocentric concern with land, as opposed to a concern with people. While land has long been a scarce resource in Europe, owing to centuries of overpopulation and a feudal system that equated land with wealth, the African continent was, until the nineteenth century, relatively underpopulated. Land was plentiful. What was important was that which was scarce: people. Jane Guyer's ""wealth in people"" work is excellent on this point. Bayart is good too. While there does generally exist an acknowledgment of the first-comers to a given region--in many places they are called ""earth priests""--such as the Batwa of present-day Cameroon or the Somba of northern Benin--newcomers, such as the many Bantu-speaking groups, displaced these peoples and often co-opted them, most often as ritual specialists. Kairn Kleiman's work is excellent on this point.

Concerning b) European and American understandings of Africa have constructed the continent as timeless, unchanging, and pristine, where true, unadulterated ""culture"" still endures despite Western modernity. The film reflect these conceits with the travels of the two main characters, one from rural to urban, the other from urban to rural. In both cases the rural is somehow unaffected by the modern (read Western, developed) world. The work of Charles Piot offers a much-needed corrective to such distorted views.

Disclaimer: I am a graduate student in socio-cultural anthropology in the United States and my dissertation research focuses on local understandings of international development aid among a certain people in West Africa. This film, while as well-intentioned as a tourist who spends three weeks hiking Mount Kili on holiday, does little service to furthering (and correcting) Western understandings of this continent.",1292630400,8,2150,5.4894259818731115
7946279,4,B00005N5SM,I am using this series in my middle school geography class.  We are studying the culture by looking at the biomes and how people live and work among the land.  This has been a good visual for the student.  In the desert biome we learned about the Tuareg people group and followed a young boy on his first caravan trip across the desert. It held the students interest and opened their eyes to another culture and hopefully a heart for Africa and its people.,1239062400,3,456,4.404761904761905
7946280,4,B00005N5SM,"Most of the currently existing reviews do a poor job of describing exactly what this series of four DVDs contains.  Each DVD contains 2 episodes about life in modern Africa (i. e. eight episodes total).  In particular, each episode focuses in on young African men and women who must make important life decisions and how the transformation of African society into the modern world impacts these decisions.  Each episode is centered in a different region of Africa.  Fundamentally, this series explores the tension of the old ways of doing things and the new ways and how the two can coexist to make something better than the sum of the parts.  For example, in the first episode we follow the lives of two women in East Africa (Kenya), one of whom has chosen to get married and live in the bush with her husband, the other who lives as a single mother in a big city but returns to her small village to have a baby so that the child with have some contact with his roots.  We learn a bit about the traditional culture of the people of East Africa, and see how this is being changed by the modern world.  In many ways, the woman living in the big city has an easier life, but something is lost in this choice, and she realizes it.  The other seven episodes continue in a similar vein, exploring life among Pygmies in the Congo, nomads in the Sahara, Orthodox Christians in Ethiopia, and other African peoples.

The best part of this DVD series is that you will, I believe, begin to understand the great diversity in cultures in Africa.  The history, the cultures, the world views of the people who populate Africa is incredibly diverse.  Some peoples were influenced by Islam, some not, some greatly affected by Western colonialism and Christianity, others not.  The landscape, the weather, the vegetation, and the animal life also play/played an important role in the development of each African culture.  Even people living in close proximity can be very different (and certainly distinct from the Western world).

There is some great cinematography of the flora and fauna of Africa, as well as the landscape, but this is not the central theme.  If this is what you are looking for (a study of the plants, animals, and landscape of Africa), you'll be sadly disappointed.  Some of the most glowing reviews wax poetic about the cinematography, and I think this is overstated.  Also, some of the political correctness in the dialogue becomes tedious.  Nearly every culture presented in this series (there are one or two exceptions) lives in peace and harmony with their neighbors, working in synergy and sharing for the greater good of all.

This is a great series, but the only reason that I give it four stars is that it is not something that you'll watch over and over.  I wouldn't recommend that anyone actually spend money to add this to their permanent collection.  Definitely worth watching as a rental, but probably not a collectable for most viewers.",1231632000,14,2955,4.732421875
