7914181,5,B00000K3UM,"Our whole family loves Billy, having first seen him in this video.  My two-year-old and my seven-year-old both jump up to dance along, and my husband and I sing along and cheer.  It's great for everyone.  Fun, funny, wholesome songs, great dance beats for little ones, and you gotta love the recycled instruments!  I highly recommend this and the ""What Kind of Cat Are You"" CD.  Billy tours in live shows, and we watch for him to be near us ...!",1061769600,,445,4.444444444444445
7914182,5,B00000K3UM,"My kids (ages 4 and 9) had never heard Billy Jonas when I brought home this video, but his music is so infectious and enjoyable that they were both out of their seats and bouncing around within about 30 seconds of turning it on.  The video replicates the energy of his live performance with kids in the 'audience' dancing and singing along.
I am your usually-cynical grown-up who would ordinarily avoid children's music for fear of sentimentality and bad songwriting, but Billy Jonas writes wisecracking lyrics and tuneful melodies that even Mom and Dad will be singing to themselves in the car on the way to work (""Some Houses are made of wood [mom bangs on the steering wheel]...bang on them and they sound good [mom bangs on the steering wheel some more]"").
Since we got the video we've seen Billy perform live; you should drive for miles if you get that chance, he will lift your spirits for weeks.",1049932800,4,902,4.6375
7914183,5,B00000K3UM,"Excellent.  This video is what all other children's music videos aspire to be - entertaining, not just eye and ear candy.  My kids are working hard on learning the hand motions.  They can hardly wait to see him live!",1045612800,,216,4.487179487179487
7914184,5,B00000K3UM,"My whole family loves this video. I bought it for my 8 year old -- who favors songs like ""Pharoah, Pharoah"" (a song about the Exodus to the tune of ""Louie, Louie"" -- you've gotta hear it!). My 2 year old loves it too. And, the grown-ups in the house sing along at the tops of voices and drum on the tables and chairs. Billy encourages lots of participation with drumming on found instruments and dance moves.
It's infectious fun -- just look at how much fun the kids on the video are having!",1033430400,,491,4.23404255319149
7914185,5,B00000K3UM,"This has been my 22 month old's favorite video since we bought it eight months ago!  It has inspired him to dance, sing and create his own music in countless ways; the message from Billy Jonas is that we are all musicians and that making music (useing old pot lids and the like) is riotously FUN!  Billy Jonas talks directly to his audiance and thoughout invites those watching to dance, sing and make music  -- his joy is infectious!!  A great video to own and give.",978998400,,467,4.395348837209302
7914186,5,B00000K3UM,"I love this video.  More importantly, my almost-three-year-old daughter thinks its the best.  Billy's use of ""industrial repercussion"" (recycled drums, bells, etc.) is inspiring her to find musical instruments  with anything in the house.
The kids in the video are energetic and fun  to watch, but it's Billy's music that makes this a winner.  Favorites:  ""Some Houses,"" about where we live and what our houses are made  of; ""Old St. Helens"" the best song to date about the famous  eruption of May 18, 1980--complete with dance steps; ""One,"" a  high energy tune with some great drumming by Billy.",964137600,3,596,5.0
