7927499,4,B00004YRIM,"This movie first introduces us to a decidedly psychotic kid named Wayne who from childhood on has murdered several people; including his parents.  Next we meet a drop dead gorgeous and smoldering hot b-movie scream queen named Raven Quinn of whom's marriage is falling apart as her husband cheats on her, is trying to be her daughters chief support, and who is unfortunately next door to deeply deranged Wayne.  Raven has no concept of Wayne's past much less his shrine and mannequin of Raven.  As Raven must work she has Wayne babysit both of her daughters and other times she comes to Wayne for comfort through her troubled life.

As this movie has its flaws whatwith the bad acting, ridiculous script, the main characters incredibly annoying daughters (neither one of which manage to contribute anything to the movie), Wayne spray painting his Santa costume black(Why did he do that?), the husband proving a dud character, Raven's irritating whining about her crumbling marriage, and Wayne choosing a not so great weapon of choice.

All of that aside,  this movie still delivers nicely on the thrills as there are some beautifully shot scenes interior and exterior both, there's some really amusing humor allowing the bad lines to not be all that's funny, Wayne is a decidedly memorable Christmas slasher villain who in some ways acts like Frank Zito from Maniac, it takes some amusing potshots at the b-movie business, there's a truckload of sensational nudity from the other sexy scream queens as well as Raven, Wayne isn't completely predictable,  The actor who plays Wayne while over the top with his performance, proves very intense, believably pscychotic in many ways, and he plays his role in a manner of being able to go from seemingly normal and harmless, to completely deranged so effortlessly. Above all as the kills aren't always great there are some that make the grade as the movie gives its audience plenty of those scenes to keep the horror fans happy.

Overall, as this is a cheesy b-movie with over the top acting and an absurd script, it's also very humorous, sexy, intense, and delivers on the stalker/slasher part through and through.  It's slight tribute to Maniac is awesome as well.  This movie can be watched as a sexy, slasher, comedy or just as a softcore porn.  It's not comparable to SNDN as this movie is its own thing.  But if you love SNDN as I do then this is worth a watch for sure.",1482364800,,2419,4.8024096385542165
7927500,5,B00004YRIM,"A film often seen as trash Sant Claws is actually a wonderfully crass statement on the effect of digital film making flooding the market. Starring the awesome Debbie Rochon, this ultra low budget romp is deliciously cheesy, with quotable awful lines throughout. Not to be taken to seriously but defiantly in aid of a watch, this film is best enjoyed with friends and beer (or spiked coco).",1389052800,,389,4.82089552238806
7927501,1,B00004YRIM,"Santa Claws is a horrible Christmas horror movie. Let's begin by talking about the positive things about this movie: Debbie Rochon. Well, now that we've talked about the positive, we can jump right into the many negative things about this movie. The acting is pretty much bad across the board, with the exception of Rochon. There is very little horror in this movie. I swear, this thing wouldn't scare a two year old. And the killer has the worst weapon I've ever seen in a horror movie. The weapon looks like a spork. A knife would have been far better, even if it's been the weapon of choice in hundreds of slasher movies already. The sound is also very bad in this ""film"". I had the volume turned up all the way on my computer, and was still having trouble hearing some of the dialogue. Santa Claws is just trash! There is a reason why this movie is never brought up at your annual Christmas Party. Thank God it was cheap!",1356307200,,925,4.415204678362573

7927503,5,B00004YRIM,"this was a major mistake on my behalf.i love christmas time horror movies,but this incredibly horrible b-movie is not worth buying.infact i'm selling my copy.",1238630400,,158,5.36
7927504,2,B00004YRIM,"I wouldn't even call this a horror film. Horror requires some ""unnatural threat."" Something mysterious and larger than life. What made HALLOWEEN a horror film is that Michael Meyers wouldn't die.

SANTA CLAWS is more akin to THE TOOLBOX MURDERS and MANIAC and VISITING HOURS (although not as ""slick"") in that we see the killer right away, and we see that he's a seedy and pathetic little man. So he lacks the awesome power of a Michael Meyers or Jason Vorhees.

SANTA CLAWS is also not a horror film in that about half the film (and it's a short 82 minutes) is just various women posing semi-nude for the camera. The story is about an obsessed fan (Grant Kramer) who kills everyone around this horror-porn movie actress (Debbie Rochon). So we spend much time at the porn studio watching various actresses being filmed topless. If that's what you want, great, but know that this is as much a soft-core porn film as horror.

Not much story (what porn film has a substantive story?). The acting is uniformly bad. The ""walls"" wobble when struck -- we also glimpse where the tops of these ""walls"" end. And the special effects are laughably poor. Unlike many slashers, this killer sticks to only one implement, a relatively mild-looking garden rake. He hits people with it, leaving small red dots, which we're supposed to think are gashes. Doesn't look it.

Debbie Rochon bears some resemblance to Parker Posey, though without the talent. Grant Kramer evokes Chris Elliott, though not as funny. All the actresses in this film appear to have massive breast implants.

Certainly there are many better ""killer Santa"" films. While SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT has historically garnered the most attention, I'd say that CHRISTMAS EVIL is the most inspired and thought-provoking, while DON'T OPEN TILL CHRISTMAS is a personal favorite.

I'm giving SANTA CLAWS a generous two stars because I'm a fan of both Chris Elliott and Parker Posey.",1164499200,6,1924,4.886503067484663
7927505,4,B00004YRIM,"This is a fun slasher flick which doesn't take itself to seriously. It has a wicked sense of humor and not only features the skewering of murder victims but it skewers the film industry too. It's not for everybody and those who dislike slashers should stay away, but for the rest of us there's a lot to like about this movie. The cast and writing are both on target and if you ""get"" these types of films you should definitely get Santa Claws.",1096934400,7,442,4.337349397590361
7927506,3,B00004YRIM,"Ah, Christmas and psychopathic, murderous, obsessed movie star fans-you can hardly think of one without the other.  It's the holidays, but no one is having a holly, jolly Christmas.  B movie scream queen Raven Quinn (Debbie Rochon)-zoologist, scream queen, wife, and mother-has just had a fight with her husband, and he is threatening to divorce her once he gets back home from an out-of-town photo shoot.  Her in-laws despise her because of her body-baring film career (although they have no problem with her husband photographing naked women in his job).  The only person she can turn to is her ingratiatingly nice neighbor Wayne (Grant Kramer).  What she does not know is that Wayne is completely obsessed with her, maintaining a Raven shrine inside his house.  With her marriage on the rocks, he thinks the time is right to make his move.  Now, Wayne has some problems; just ask his mother and uncle-oh, wait, you can't ask them because he shot them to death as a young teenager.  He wants Raven all to himself, and this raging desire compels him to murder everyone who might get in his way.  By the time the end game rolls around, Wayne has transformed himself into the dastardly Santa Claws, and he decides who has been naughty and who has been nice.
Obviously, this is a low-budget B-movie production.  Some effort went into making the film, but there's no mistaking its origins.  The acting is quite bad at times, although I think Debbie Rochon puts in a better than average performance as Raven; the sets are sadly unimpressive, especially the furnishings in Debbie's home (she and her husband could certainly have afforded better furniture); and the accompanying music is oftentimes just a step above elevator muzak, although I do give the filmmakers credit for attempting to insert relevant songs to accompany the story as it progresses-the intent was there, but apparently the money was not.  Grant Kramer gives an inconsistent performance as the serial killer and Raven fanatic Wayne, and this limits the effectiveness of this movie to some degree.  It can be rather painful to watch him sitting before his shrine confessing his love for Raven, but he comes across pretty well in those scenes requiring him to be psychotically angry and frustrated.  I must also mention the murder weapon of choice here-it is a little plastic set of claws that wouldn't scare a child in the middle of a graveyard on Halloween night.  This little toy is quite deadly in Wayne's hands, though.  What I found really funny was the appearance of the murder victims after the fact; someone basically just took fake blood and daubed a few spots here and there on the bodies.
Certainly, there are problems with this movie.  I for one am still confused about one particular sequence wherein several scenes seemed to be presented in the wrong order.  I have to admit, though, that I really did enjoy watching Santa Claws.  I would have enjoyed it even more if, instead of having to watch the shadow of the claws rise and fall against the wall, I had been allowed to actually witness the brutal murders as they took place-there is really no blood and gore to speak of here.",1045612800,8,3158,4.804066543438077
7927507,1,B00004YRIM,"This movie was just anemic. The acting was terrible, the killing scenes were laughable, and the plot has been done before (brilliantly compared to this dog). The 'ladies' in the story should keep their clothes on. The only good thing I can say about this DVD is that the previews of other movies they included are better than the main attraction. If Santa brings you this DVD for Christmas, you KNOW you've been bad. Give me the lump of coal, instead!!!",996192000,7,453,4.604938271604938
