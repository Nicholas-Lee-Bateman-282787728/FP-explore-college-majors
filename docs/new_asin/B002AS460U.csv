3891431,5,B002AS460U,"This 1999 scripted series consists of 12 full frame (wasn't filmed widescreen) episodes, about 30 minutes each.  In USA was originally on BBC America.  Chris Langham's character (unseen, but heard) interviews people in 12 occupations, featuring famous British actors such as Sarah Alexander, Bill Nighy and David (Dr. Who) Tennant.  Unbelievably funny material which can be watched repeatedly.  You don't have to be a fan of British humor to enjoy these episodes.  Highly recommended for humor and originality.",1247875200,21,510,5.487179487179487

3891433,1,B002AS460U,"This was not the item I was looking for - evidently there are several series with the same name.  I hope to be able to use this in another context, but I was disappointed when I received it because I thought it was the American version.",1415491200,,236,4.130434782608695

3891435,5,B002AS460U,"If you like dry, dead pan humor you will love PEOPLE LIKE US. Honestly I don't know why American Tv hasn't stolen this idea yet. They took the office from the Brits why not PEOPLE.

Just know you'll have to watch each episode a few times because some of the jokes are so subtle you miss them the first time because you were laughing so hard from the joke before it.

Love you Roy Malard!",1407542400,,387,4.1466666666666665
3891436,2,B002AS460U,Its quite an effort to get thru this.  Good moments are far apart.  The delivery style puts me to sleep.  I will not watch the other disks and give this away soon.,1404950400,,163,4.03125

3891438,5,B002AS460U,"Stands up to repeated play.  The TV version every bit as good as it was on radio.  Every line, action, gesture, and look is not to be missed in comprising the whole of this comic masterpiece.",1395619200,,191,4.277777777777778
3891439,5,B002AS460U,"If you happen to be lucky enough to catch the very funny Brit mockumentary ""Twenty-Twelve"", which aired right before the 2012 Summer Olympics in London (the premise of the fictional series being about a rather inept and clueless Olympic Planning Committee, trying to get London ready for the Olympics; Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham on ""Downton Abbey"", got to show his comedy chops by playing the bumbling but likable head of the planning committee), this series was done by the same creator (who also used some of the same actors from this series for ""Twenty Twelve"", like David Tennant, etc.) and is even funnier; the premise is that a fictional (and mostly unseen) ""documentarian"" by the great silly name of Roy Mallard is going around profiling individuals in different professions & walks of life: a cop, a real estate agent, a reverend, an actor (played by David Tennant), a mid-life crisis photographer (played by the great Bill Nighy, in my favorite episode of the series), etc., etc.; and in the fine ""Office""/Christopher Guest-ian tradition of the best mockumentaries, of course most of the people that he interviews & follows around are hopelessly inept and/or bumbling at their particular chosen fields, but nonetheless still charming and irresistibly likable in their earnest attempts to live up to life's expectations.  This is British humor at its best-- dry, subtle & quirky, and worth watching for all the clever little touches that don't have to bash you over the head the way some more heavy-handed comedies do in order to make you laugh.  Especially funny is the way that Roy Mallard himself, who although mostly behind the camera, somehow always manages to get involved in his subject's lives in amusingly awkward ways, which is a joke in itself, since if you know anything about documentary-making, one of the ""rules"" is that you're NOT supposed to get involved but stay detached & ""pretend you're not there"", so you supposedly don't ""influence"" the subjects in any way; and yet the joke of it is that Roy Mallard is clearly just as bumbling, awkward, and ineffectual as the people he's putting on camera.  Funny writing (especially Mallard's ineptly-written, awkwardly-worded voice-overs) and funny performances.  Highly recommended!",1392595200,6,2266,5.132791327913279
3891440,3,B002AS460U,Just not up to par with other English programs.  It wass a complete disappointment for me to receive and should resell it.,1386547200,,122,4.545454545454546
3891441,5,B002AS460U,"This DVD set is so enjoyable, I watch it over and over whenever I need a good genuine laugh.  Poor Roy Mallard, I love the running gag of people being surprised about his marital status.  I love that he is so awkward, cumbersome, and generally in the wrong place.  I feel like there could have been at least another eight seasons.",1374883200,,330,4.377049180327869
3891442,5,B002AS460U,"I caught the last 3 episodes of Series 2 late one night flipping channels on my cable box, and having (by luck) landing on a local PBS station. This is one of the funniest and drollest ""mockumentaries"" I have ever seen, and it really does surpass Gervais' The Office (which was really the zenith until veiwing this series). Very amusing take on various walks of life from a rather inept interviewer behind the camera. One or two episodes are a little less amusing (such as the Policeman episode, which was a little flat), but some are just ridiculously hilarious throughout. The pinnacle has to be Bill Nighy as the titular ""the Photographer"" episode. I haven't laughed so hard and almost consistently for the 29 minutes run time in memory!

Well worth checking out!",1374710400,2,766,4.7593984962406015
3891443,5,B002AS460U,"This one was a long time coming in being released for purchase.  If you love quick witted humor, you might like this series.  No laugh tracks on this one -- if you're not quick enough, you might miss some of the jokes!  Filmed in the style of a documentary, People Like  Us focuses on the lives of ordinary people.  But things go terribly wrong during the production, and despite the producer's constant comments to his subjects to ""pretend that (he's) not here,"" he gets caught up in all kinds of situations he didn't expect.",1372118400,3,526,4.553191489361702
3891444,3,B002AS460U,"As a die-hard Anglophile, I expect a lot from my Britcom (particularly when the BBC deems it good/popular enough to transcribe it onto a Region 1 DVD).  These are pretty good, but not necessarily amazingly clever or packed with laugh-out-loud moments.  The acting is usually excellent, particularly the voiceovers (and watch out for a young David Tennant--dreamy!).  The material, while entertaining, just never really takes off for me.  It might be down to the format; maybe the mockumentary has been exhausted as a form of comedy.",1359244800,,532,5.151162790697675
3891445,5,B002AS460U,"I agree; ""People Like Us"" is just fantastic dry BritCom humor.  The sole under-5-star review just adds to it; the reviewer didn't realize it was a spoof, which just proves how brilliant it is.",1333843200,3,192,4.647058823529412
3891446,5,B002AS460U,"Very droll, very funny.  It is not slapstick, it is the use of language that makes it funny.  Also, the narrator's voice is a beautiful baritone.  Although what he says is silly, he is nice to listen to.",1291766400,5,203,4.2894736842105265
3891447,3,B002AS460U,"I didn't realize this was a ""mockumentary"" when I bought it.  Should have looked at it better, I guess.  The first episode, I quickly realize it was not real.  Having seen (and loved) the original ""Office"" I found this to be similar, but just not good enough to compare.  As the other episodes came on, I became more used to it and enjoyed it more. Some were good, others didn't really make it.  All it all, it was okay.  The best one by far, was the one with Bill Nighy.  He was totally convincing as a real person.  I thought some spoofs in some of the episodes were a little over the top and not very good.  For me, this would have been something I probably should have just rented... were that possible.  I am glad I saw it, but not sure it was worth purchasing.",1278115200,5,766,4.184931506849315

3891449,5,B002AS460U,"This mockumemtary concept of humor was pioneered here  and this was the first of its format, and was and is still the funniest TV Series I have seen since the advent of Python in the 60's. The writing is incredible. Langham does a great job of ending every sentence with a tangential noun or verb.. pure genius to listen to and watch. From this sprang the Office and others, but this has never been replicated by anyone else since. You do have to be british I think to truly understand the mockery going on.",1261440000,4,507,4.3936170212765955
3891450,5,B002AS460U,"Those who love great British humor should rejoice at the release of this
fantastic series in the US! Unique fake documentaries with the world's

You're in for a wonderful surprise. Get this DVD, at $25 for the complete series is a steal. I got mine from the UK, and I paid twice as much which still is a reasonable price for twelve episodes of this great show. Buy it now. NOW. NOW!!!

For fans of: The Office, The Day Today, British shows with subtle, self-deprecating humor (or humour?).

8360217,5,B002AS460U,"This is quite funny.  You must be willing to listen carefully or you will miss the blandly tame comedy, and it is generally nonsense, but good, chuckling nonsense!!  The narrator is so sincere in his delivery that you can be lulled into thinking there is nothing really funny going on, until you pay attention and realize it is a really good spoof, one that can fool you when you realize you just missed the point about what was just said or transpired.",1432252800,,453,4.512195121951219

8360219,5,B002AS460U,"A bit on the expensive side but worth every penny.  Saw this when it first aired on the Beeb and it's better the second and third (and . . .) times around.  Written by the same chap who did the also excellent Twenty Twelve, it stars many familiar actors from popular dramas.  Their ability to deliver hilarious dialogue with straight faces always amazes me.  No one does satire better than the British and this is a prime example.  There's no violence or sex;  unfortunately, it was edited a bit to protect delicate American sensibilities but more than enough remains to keep one laughing for 6 hours.  Wish there additional episodes.",1426204800,2,634,4.709090909090909
