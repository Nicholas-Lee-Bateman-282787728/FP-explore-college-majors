8490945,5,B0061SJRW2,"I agree with Peter, Daisy, Kathy, Mary, and Naomi.  This is a superior product by a skilled and empathetic instructor who has the unusual ability to take people at their present skill level (regardless of what that may be) and move them forward to their maximum potential. She does this in a friendly and supportive manner which brings confidence and a sense of achievement to the participants. Although this is billed as a program for ""seniors"", it would certainly benefit anyone of any age, from children on up.  Anyone who wants to improve his/her overall strength, flexibility, balance, and conditioning should consider Mary Ann's ""Yoga for Seniors"".",1407196800,,654,5.102803738317757
8490946,4,B0061SJRW2,"This set of 2 DVDs has a lot to offer: many options (chaptered) and targeted practices.  Mary Ann is a very knowledgeable teacher and has a calm and soothing voice.  The music is lovely and relaxing.  The only aspect that surprised me (hence only 4 stars) is that it is mostly filmed indoors, which I didn't expect at all considering the cover of the DVD shows lovely gardens and a YouTube video I found about this DVD also showed the participants talking about their experiences whilst sitting outdoors in the same location.  But, all in all, a very complete Yoga DVD set.",1407196800,,573,4.588235294117647
8490947,5,B0061SJRW2,"After 2 surgeries, concomitant weight gain, and not going to yoga classes, starting up again was daunting, so I spent time researching DVDs to ease my way back into feeling more at one with my body again.
I bought Yoga for Seniors, and worked my way slowly through the DVD. After becoming more familiar with the practices in the DVD, I found that it was progressively easier to drop into groundedness and awareness of the sensations in my body. This deep connection is so important to me because it helps me monitor my body's progress with healing and connects me with the world around me.
I started out with the 20 minute practice and a couple of need-targeted practices to focus on my lower back and neck/shoulders. With this combination, the contracted muscles in my neck and shoulders started to loosen up, and I was able to sleep more comfortably and move more freely. What a pleasure! Over time I have tried many of the shorter practices and feel able to find my niche in each of them, since Maryann details several progressive possibilities for each position.
This is my favorite yoga DVD because Maryann gives detailed explanations about how to approach each movement as it comes and is able to connect the movement with its effect on the gestalt body. I also admire her careful and loving support of each individual's process.",1348185600,,1335,4.733905579399142
8490948,5,B0061SJRW2,The DVD helped me overcome my fear of hurting myself doing Yoga.  It showed me ways to care and love my body. Mary Ann's teaching's made me more aware of the importance of our breath which is our life.,1348099200,,201,4.153846153846154
8490949,5,B0061SJRW2,"As Mary Ann teaches, it's easy to feel right at home with her.  She's supportive, kind and gentle as she expertly guides her students through the yoga practice.  With stretches, strengthening exercises and deep breathing, there are a variety of ways to benefit.  With enough practice, the mind calms and stress disappears!  In addition, the DVD even has classes tailored to specific needs such as relieving lower back tension.",1330992000,,426,5.130434782608695
8490950,5,B0061SJRW2,"I saw Mary Ann Alexander on NBC's Living Well program (on YouTube) and it was evident that she really supported her yoga students when they embarked on what were sometimes totally new practices for them.  I think it is important that a teacher has a lot of individual time for their students so that they can practice yoga without fear of hurting themselves and get the maximum benefit from each day's practices.  Her Yoga DVD is really tailored for those of us who are not twenty, thirty of forty anymore.  It also has the same patient care I witnessed in the YouTube video about her.",1323216000,,585,4.552380952380952
