5159614,2,B008GM1012,"It appears they were going for the Love Comes Softly Series,even if they were not, this movie was a let down. The scene was nice however the acting was disappointing and the way she spoke to him when he went through her things was ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! She spoke to him like a child, could not feel the romance. The responses to the dramatic scences could have been better.",1353369600,11,374,4.514705882352941
5159615,4,B008GM1012,"This story provides an interesting premise for a love story, and for the most part, it delivers.

The set-up is not totally unfamiliar: a single mom with children, isolated, trying to make a go of it in a primitive enviroment.  Along comes a handsome(once he shaves) mysterious stranger in need.  The added relish, it's the Civil War; he's of the enemy that killed her husband, and he's recently escaped from a brutal prison.

It's a great plot for interesting interactions, and an ever present feeling of danger looms overhead, makes it all the more romantic.  Can he be trusted?  Will the authorities catch up to him and kill him?  Can the heroine resist the growing feelings she's developing?

In general, the filming, sets, and acting are fine. It's a tad low budget, and in places, it comes across like TV show and the costumes a bit stagey looking.  The outdoor shots with the cold were much better, and the music flows fine with the scenes, which can be problem with lower budgets.  We really liked the hero; his acting appeared more natural and real with less words and more expressiveness.

It garnered 5 Doves out of 5 for family approved.  There's a small amount of blood shown, and scenes of threatening and endangerment, but overall, most school kids can watch this.",1353369600,24,1279,4.737556561085973
5159616,5,B008GM1012,"Once in awhile you come across a love story to be added to your list of favorites. For me, ""Civil Love"" is one of those movies.

Rachel and her two children must find a way to survive on their own after the death of Rachel's husband a year earlier. A soldier for the Union Army during the Civil War, Rachel's husband was killed by enemy soldiers. When faced with a proposition to remarry the local sheriff, will Rachel do so, even if it means being married to someone she doesn't love? And what will she do about the stranger she found injured in her barn? After all, the stranger is a Confederate soldier - just like the ones who killed her husband.

Daniel recently escaped from a Union Army prison. A Confederate soldier from Georgia, Daniel is shot in his attempt to return home. Will he survive the brutal cold? Will he be able to outrun the two men relentlessly searching for him? What happens when he collapses in a barn, only to discover later it is the barn of a woman who has lost her Union Army husband at the hands of Daniel's fellow soldiers? Will she turn him in to the sheriff?

""Civil Love"" is not only a love story, but it's also an action story, which makes it perfect for a husband/wife movie night. The characters are real-to-life and the plot is engaging.  Family unity, loyalty, love, honesty, and not judging others are the themes showcased in this movie.

""Civil Love"" contains nothing offensive and I would highly recommend it for those ages nine and over due to a scene showing Daniel's wound, a scary scene of a burglary, and a shoot-out which might frighten very young children.

I have placed this movie in my library of favorite movies  - thank you SunWorld Pictures for creating enjoyable and wholesome family entertainment!

5159629,1,B008GM1012,"If you want to see a worse movie, watch Mystery Science Theater 3000, which is a show where they watch and comment on bad movies.  This was like a high school film with better sets.  The script was wooden, as were the performances.  Maybe it was the directing that was bad, because most actors are capable of a lot better.  I watched it over Amazon Prime, while playing World of Warcraft, or I wouldn't have wasted the time.  Part of the score sounds to me to be a rip-off of the 2005 Pride & Prejudice (at first I was thinking Atonement, then I figured I had the wrong Keira Knightly film); I hope they got permission ...

Still, if you want something on in the background, and don't mind an unbelievable romance, and it's included in Amazon Prime, then go ahead and watch it.  I feel so sad for the actors.

(Btw, they even go to the trouble of making the Confederate love interest more likable because he really wasn't backing the south, just was part of the army because his wife was dead and he had no family, so he had no choice but to enlist, naturally.)",1503446400,,1061,4.3232323232323235

The filmography was beautiful especially the snow in the woods and rushing stream, but the plot needed to go into a deeper development of the characters.

5159642,4,B008GM1012,"Watched this on a Friday night, whilst nursing a sore back. I enjoyed the premise, plot (albeit, pretty predictable) but that was what I was going for when I chose the movie.  The acting is OK, but sometimes, its a little bit like nails on a chalkboard, sometimes kind of stiff and doesn't flow well, but it kicks itself forward.
**Semi-spoiler**
The cute part I found out, was that the young actor that plays the female lead characters' young son, is actually the son of the male lead, so when you see the male lead, Daniel and the young son, Joshua, bond, it is very believable.  I actually thought that the actors playing Joshua and Daniel were so good at that point, because it was just so natural and believable.
The other male lead, Johnathan, the sheriff brother in law, I believe I saw him in another ""Christian"" based movie, but he goes by a different name.  It has to be him, its the same facial expression, mole, teeth, just too much of a coincidence for it to NOT be him. He played a very similar character, the guy that DOESN'T get the girl.  The other movie was called, Belle and the Beast, also here on PRIME.  There is another actor that was in that same movie and kind of plays a similar ""type"" of character.  That is the renegade Marshal that is after Daniel, ""Marshal Blackhurst"", Matthew Reese, he is in the movie as well.  If you watched Belle and the Beast, you will know what I mean, he played ""the Beast""

5159646,3,B008GM1012,"Pros:  It is CLEAN in every aspect (the only part a kid couldn't watch was when Daniel got shot and you saw what appeared to be an actual wound).
""Daniel"" and ""Jason"" are fairly believable, in their roles, except that Daniel had no Southern accent at all.
Realistic looking scenery.
It has a satisfying ending.
Nice to see that two warring factions could forgive and forget.
Cons:  Every aspect of the plot is predictable (you KNEW the doc was going to somehow spill the story of the fugitive he treated; you also knew that the brother-in-law sheriff was jealous and would somehow try to get even.  Even his intervention in the ending you knew was coming.)
The heroin's acting is extremely stilted, wooden.
""Rachel"" goes from a hostile, fiercely loyal widow, to falling in love with her apparent enemy in no time flat without much interaction with ""Daniel.""
Very unbelievable scenarios throughout; many other reviewers mentioned the horseback ride where the riders were never seen actually riding the horses, just bouncing up and down in place.  What they failed to mention was the fact that someone with a bullet wound to the lower abdomen would only ride a horse after months of recovery; Daniel's wound hadn't had that much time to heal.",1492905600,2,1240,4.834905660377358
5159647,2,B008GM1012,"I agree with the other reviewer who said within 5 minutes they had to stop watching since the acting was so painful.

I felt it only fair to revise this review after thinking about it. I wouldn't criticize the kids because they're kids, so they're not even part of the critique. Matthew Bellows and Paul D. Hunt were actually good and I'm sure they have and will go on to greater things. If you're unsure about whether or not to watch this, watch the first five minutes then fast forward and watch a couple of minutes, fast forward, do the same thing again.

I did not find the female lead to be particularly appealing (writer's script problem which her acting did not help) and her daughter was probably only 6 years younger than the mom in real life! Daniel did not really have a very Southern accent or a country accent, either. He did not have to sound ""Deep South,"" but a little more softness in his speech patterns would have helped.
The costumes were noticeably ill-fitting - especially the daughter's dress.....and her mom was a SEAMSTRESS???? Also, I doubt if any mother back then would have let her daughter's hair look like a rats' nest all the time.
The most enjoyable moments were when Daniel was talking to her kids and when she FINALLY showed some emotion when she yelled at her brother-in-law, accusing him of being happy his brother was dead.
However, the brother-in-law did a very good and convincing job of portraying a rather jealous and infatuated man.
And a BALL thrown at this frontier-type location? Why not just a big party/dance?
The bad man just seemed petulant, not as menacing as he should have been.
Best actors: the brother-in-law and the boy
Biggest problem: lack of emotion and suspense
Most annoying problem: wardrobe and styling (wardrobe and dialogue)
However, I will probably watch it again to see if I missed anything..........:)",1483574400,,1534,4.926640926640927

The girl's hair wasn't of that time period as well as wearing pants.  The girl was just learning to knit by that age she would've learned the survival basics such as cooking, sewing, knitting, caring for the animals, hunting, etc.  One more note about the girl, she was wearing braces in the last family scene!  The boy was also very inept at the basic chores.  The children shouldn't have had to be told to do the chores or how to do them.  Daniel didn't even pitch in to 'earn his keep', when he was better.

Also the American troops who facilitated the machine gun killings of box cars full of surrendered Afghani soldiers.  Also the ""American"" soldiers who urinated on the dead bodies of enemy so as to ""baptize"" them into the homosexual Xian ""religion"".

I KNOW the customs.  I KNOW the feelings of one side towards the other.  The costumes were modern--sorry fedoras were an unknown item in the 1860s.  And then there was the tripe about the widow and her family moving in with her brother in law.  At the time, NO ONE would have thought that improper; in fact, it would have been considered the normal thing to do.  Unlike today, families ""living together"" didn't mean having sex.  Knowing the Northern POW camps, I would say that any prisoner found by a civilian would have been immediately reported, as smallpox and other diseases ran rampant through those camps.

The dialect and costuming were totally off.  The actors were spic and span, soap scrubbed clean at all times, not a hair out of place.  They never even work up a sweat running through the woods.  A few of the minor actors could act a few lines, but the major roles were pretty awful. It reminded me of a movie that was probably totally casted by family members or ""friends"" of the family - like lets get together and make a movie - Uncle Barney can be the robber and cousin Mable can be the teenage girl. It was obviously low budget, but even that shouldn't make a difference when you have great actors, clothing that fits the era and real life in the 1860's.  Come now!  People got dirty and sweaty!  I sure don't like giving a family movie a score like this. The idea behind it is good, just horribly carried out. Sorry, but it was terrible.",1467072000,,993,4.311827956989247

Sometimes there are gaps, and sometimes there are actors whose feelings don't really feel in place because of those gaps.  What I mean about the fix is that if the production wants to keep to a certain # of minutes, tighten those dialogue moments and add back 'contemplation' time by nature visuals.  The final edit will put it into a higher category production.

The clothing is too clean and bright. Men's hats look as if they were just purchased. The farm still has saddle horses and ample supplies (which would have been stolen/procured during the war).

The acting is so sad. The actions like hammering or brushing down the horse shine as amateurish. The lead actor looks as if he only ran for a few yards ""trying to get home."" The lead actress is too healthy to be a poor widow. Even if you close your eyes, their dialogue is stilted and uncaring.

Where are those sweet romances like The Cowboy and the Movie Star?",1449446400,,719,4.398496240601504

The acting is, with few exceptions, stiff and unconvincing.  The costuming misses the mark, flying wide of anything but the vaguest nods to the Civil War era and the plot itself, absurd.

This film was irredeemable and hard to watch.  For example, in one scene when the two main characters go on a horseback ride together, the camera switches from close-up to close-up of their faces as they converse.  You can see, though, by watching the background, that although they are sort of swaying and bobbing, that they are not actually moving forward.  The actors are not riding horses, they're just pretending to move as if they were. How maddening constant stupid things like that can be!",1445558400,5,816,5.044776119402985

Making out 25 feet from the doorway to their cabin where her children and others can see her is also unrealistic for that error.  Others are calling this a family movie.

Into her life walks a stranger on the run,  a rebel soldier,  trying to make it home while others pursue him.  Good drama,  sincere acting,  family-oriented.

And so much of what goes on doesn't make sense. Feels like a play written and filmed by 6th graders with Dad's video camera... and directed by a 4th grade little sister. One of the worst films I have ever seen.

The protagonist, Rachel, is so unlikable I would think only a masochistic man would want her. The teen daughter is bizarrely attired with unbrushed hair. NO ONE keeps a bridle a horse ALL the time - and the wood chopping? Find a ""soft spot""??? BWA HA HA HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA!!! I have chopped a LOT of wood. Man, a soft spot would be GREAT!!

Nothing about this story is remotely believable. And I'm wasting more time than it's worth here explaining only a tiny fraction of what is wrong with it. I think the writer should... um... oh, forget it. The writing is juvenile - absolutely terrible and it goes down from there.

I did read somewhere that this is a Christian film. That fits. I have never seen a Christian film that isn't ghastly. This one fits right in. I feel sorry for the actors.",1433980800,3,1163,4.450704225352113

I really disliked the character of the woman--always getting after everyone else. I found it disgusting how she ordered her children around like she owned them and did not allow them to experience adventure. Perhaps the imagination could forgive her because of her ""wounds"", but she seemed very selfish not to understand that everyone else had wounds also. I'm afraid the imagination would deduct that after the fascination with her new husband wore off, she would only increase her efforts of sergeant to him and her children. The young girl seemed to have no backbone to not stand up to her mother when she was unfair. Teenagers in all ages of time have generally exhibited rebellion when they are not treated with respect, so the girls submission to her demanding mother seems neither admirable nor realistic.",1431648000,,959,4.748502994011976

Rachel was not likable at all. Always bossy and smiled when it was her cue. Don't see how 2 men could fall in love with her or even want to be around her! The snow was a joke. It only appeared in some scenes and no one seemed cold! The morning that the brother-in-law came and saw the 2 tied up men, I laughed. Then men were barely tied up and never said one word of defense. Just sat there for the scene. Even when they were taken into town, they looked like they were on a casual stroll! The first kiss had zero passion. The costumes were kinda funny, too.

We've all become so used to Holly-weird over-the-top acting, that when period pieces are presented in simple terms, as simple people lived, then it apparently implies they're bad actors.  The scene when they confessed their love to one another was so moving in its restraint, it was beautiful.  That's my take on it.",1429488000,,521,4.7555555555555555

How hard would it have been to throw him in a rebel soldier outfit & the marshal in a union one? Plus the daughter & the pants??? No women wore pants in that time period...tomboy or not. I also think the marshal could have been a little meaner and more believable--seems like that would have been an easy enough part to play. That particular actor played a mean, hateful man in Belle & the Beast which was much more believable...so not sure what the deal is with this similar part. So, I get the complaints...but oh, my goodness...it totally doesn't warrant overlooking this movie! I knew before I watched it, that they would end up together...I didn't watch it to be surprised! Yet, the story was not boring. The characters drew me in. I could just imagine the hatred she felt, then  the hesitance of letting her guard down, and the sense of betrayal to her husband, her family, and her country by having feelings for the enemy! I think the actors played the parts well...there was the staunchness that you would expect from a person in her circumstance, and the honor, integrity, and Job -like patience of the man which won her over.

The guy who played her brother in law has potential as an actor and maybe if he had a better director, he would have done better. The kids were okay. Too bad they didn't have more script to work with. The bad guys... now one of those two was really good. The goofy guy. His ""leader"" was okay. I wish they could have done more with this script. It is not a fully flushed out script or movie. I hate giving bad reviews. There is no depth to this movie. No brilliance. No real growth.

5160465,4,B008GM1012,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Civil Love was really, really clean, except for two scenes.  In the first, a man is shot and we see a very bloody wound.  In the second, he has to cut out the bullet, but you don't see a close up.  They cut the picture above the would so you only see some blood on his hands and shirt and you can tell he is in pain.  Two men intend to shoot a man to keep him silent about a situation.  In an exchange of fire one of them is killed and the other man runs off; a man is wounded with a gunshot to the shoulder and two other men intend to rob a woman, but are stopped.

Most say the acting is amateurish and the storyline predictable.  That may be true, but other than the bloody scene (which I have to admit was not necessary to show), this movie was clean and had high morals and taught a good message.  The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for ages 12 and older.  Because it is a movie that takes place during the Civil War, talk of loss and men hunting another is expected.  It is probably the cleanest Civil War movie ever made, however, because of the two scenes with blood and the fact that a soldier is being hunted I wouldn't recommend it for children.  It is still move of an adult show.

It starts with Daniel (a confederate soldier) fleeing from two men who shot him (this is where the wound is shown).  He hides in a barn, removes the bullet and passes out.  Rachel, the widow who own the farm, has two children.  While doing their chores they find him and the mother bandages his wound, leaves him food, but ties him up just to be safe.  She is afraid because her husband was killed by confederate soldiers in the war.  Daniel ends up saving her and the children from robbers and as they all learn to trust and care for each other, they become a makeshift family.  However, Rachel's brother-in-law and town sheriff, doesn't like the idea.  Rachel makes him promise not to arrest him or tell anyone about him, but he eventually finds it too much when Rachel's turns down his marriage proposal and she admits to caring for Daniel, so he tells the two men hunting Daniel where he is.  Rachel finds out and after telling her brother-in-law who the two men really are, they both go try and save Daniel and to arrest the two men.  As in most of these kinds of movies, all ends happily.

The costumes are awful. Totally awful!! There was no synthetic fabric in the 1860's. Also no zippers and the styles were totally wrong.  Besides that the mom seemed way too young to have kids that old. The Confederate soldier has no southern accent but one of the men hunting him did. The wood chopping scene...it was obvious that the wood was already split. I gave it 2 stars because it was a sweet love store.,1364947200,20,578,4.452830188679245

5160477,2,B008GM1012,"Alas!  It pains me to say it, as I support the decent and wholesome film industry.  But so often they do fall short.  And this one falls short.  The story line in and of itself, is promising.  A young Yankee widow finds a wounded Confederate soldier in her barn.  The Confederate being an escaped prisoner of war and they eventually fall-in-love.  The main drawback of the film is that they make the mistake of simply taking modern people and putting them in old timey clothing and thinking that is sufficient.  The dialogue is decidedly modern and not at all historical in nature, such as greeting each other with ""Hi!"".  The young girl actor who wear pants throughout the film has very modern looking hair.  And nobody felt ""old timey"" in their acting.  It doesn't work to just put on different clothes and think that is enough.  There is a certain getting into the feel of the historical time period being represented that is called for in a good historical film and it is that element of quality that is lacking in this movie.

8527633,1,B008GM1012,"Awful.  Acting horrible, dialogue even worse.  Clothing was wrong:  men who were searching for the escaped fugitive were wearing modern shirts crumpled and dirtied to look like civil war type. ie knit tee shirts with double needle stitching on the necklines and a facing on the other other shirt that had professionally finished overlock stitching.",1528675200,,348,5.290909090909091

8527637,2,B008GM1012,"I am very confused as to why this movie has such a decent rating. It was really really bad. The acting is terrible. The plot is unoriginal. There is no chemistry between the actors. It's not even Hallmark quality, and trust me I'm a sucker for a good Hallmark movie. I give it two stars to be generous.",1522108800,,302,4.224137931034483
8527638,4,B008GM1012,"I enjoyed it. I thought it would be just another boring Civil War time movie. It was another Civil War era movie, but it had a good story line.  I always like to see the bad guys get the justice they deserve and the good guys overcoming adversity. That's what happened in this movie.",1521244800,,283,4.2407407407407405

8527640,1,B008GM1012,"As this movie began, my first thought was: ""Wow, what fake looking scenery.""  When the main character began to speak, I thought: ""Goodness, what bad acting.""  And then the two characters began a conversation, and I thought ""What a dumb dialog this is.""

At that point I turned it off, realizing that I must have stumbled onto an amateurish production that was actually painful to watch.

The involved parties should go back to their day jobs.",1518393600,,442,4.776315789473684
8527641,2,B008GM1012,"The only way I got through this movie was because I was busy doing something else (crocheting). The acting was TERRIBLE. I didn't feel for any of the characters, never got to caring about them. There was no connection between the characters, no authentic relationship, no drama. It was a clean movie, simple story, easy to have on while I'm doing something else (which rescued me from the painful acting, though I did catch the terrible horseback conversation scene!).",1517011200,,468,4.936708860759493
8527642,1,B008GM1012,"This movie is a waste of time. Way too many things that are false to this time period. Children half the age of those portrayed would have been more adapt. Example - boy doesn't know how to chop wood? Are you kidding me.  Girl's hair is out of place as well as her wearing pants - while mother wearing dresses. BRACES can been seen by the girl at the end of the movie. ""Acting"" by most is of poor quality. You don't believe it. It's like they are reading the script - no feeling.",1516406400,,479,4.095744680851064
