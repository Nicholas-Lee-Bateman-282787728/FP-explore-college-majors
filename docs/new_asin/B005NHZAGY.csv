8480498,4,B005NHZAGY,I wanted to watch this movie to see Justin Hartley. As usual he was great and helped make this movie worth watching. The movie is on the artsy side and the story line was interesting.,1434412800,,183,4.257142857142857
8480499,1,B005NHZAGY,Pretty boring.,1413244800,,14,6.5
8480500,1,B005NHZAGY,The movie went no where.  It just mumbled along in a depressing way.  None of the characters were believable to me.,1391731200,,115,4.428571428571429
8480501,4,B005NHZAGY,Actually bought it for one of the actors in it! I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.  You make the decission!,1364774400,,109,4.45
8480502,5,B005NHZAGY,"Had been waiting for this film to hit DVD for a while, and when the release date was finally announced, I was thrilled.  Pre-ordered my copy instantly and IMPATIENTLY waited for it to arrive.  Truth be told however, I originally bought the film strictly as a fan of Justin Hartley.  Of course, Justin delivered, as he always does, but to my surprise, I was actually enjoying the film as a whole.  I could have fast forwarded, but I didn't.  I was intrigued.  I wanted to know more about the characters and what they were dealing with.  I wanted to see what happened to them, and the ending shocked me.  By the time the film was over, I have to say it was definitely worth the money...and the wait.",1326153600,,697,4.390625
8480503,4,B005NHZAGY,"This film was a splendid Jewel from out of left field. It's fun, has an excellent cast, and is well written. The director knows how to invite you to enjoy the characters with all their colorful quirks. You don't need to know anything about Scorpios to enjoy this movie. It is meant for everyone and leaves you smiling. Even the title draws you in. He makes you want to see the movie before you know ANYTHING about it!

Production values represent what you would expect from an indie, but that's OK. You have to start somewhere. It's probably the only reason I couldn't say 5 star.

Most importantly, I feel this film is unique for its time. Nobody else is really making films quite like this. You feel like you are on the inside of an inside joke. Like you are sharing a laugh along with the director.

It is endearing. You can see this Film is made from a love of the craft and host of knowledge.

Enjoy. And if you do like it, then share it with others.",1326067200,3,955,4.288888888888889
8480504,5,B005NHZAGY,"This film really surprises you with it's intelligence and satire. It's a true original. I love all the characters and how the story shows us the unique aspect to their somewhat stereotypical nature. Justin Hartley is very raw in this performance. Erin Cummings is a dream as usual! So many stars emerging from this indie film, it's sure to be a cult classic. (-;",1326067200,2,362,4.671875
