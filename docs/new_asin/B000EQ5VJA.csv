2527880,3,B000EQ5VJA,"I recently purchased Backlash 2006, expecting an average WWE PPV.  Well, that's what I got.  Backlash 2006 consisted of a few really good matches, and some mediocre matches.

Carlito vs Chris Masters

This match showed off the developing talent in these two uprising superstars.  I believe Carlito is one of the finer wrestlers in the company, with his many creative moves.  And Chris Masters has a lot of ability, but is still a rookie in the ring.  The match itself, though, had a good build-up and delivered.  A very good opener, Carlito wins.  3.5/5 stars.

Umaga vs Ric Flair

This match was basically made to put Umaga over big time.  Ric Flair has some offense in the beggining, but Umaga takes over.  Umaga puts all of his signiture moves on the Nature Boy then finishes him off with the Somoan Spike.  A semi-squash.  2/5 stars.

Mickie James vs Trish Stratus

From the beggining of the match, this was looking to be one of the best diva matches I have seen in a while.  Unfortunatly, Trish Stratus dislocates her shoulder after a fall out of the ring.  Both Mickie James and Trish Stratus have tons of talent, and this match was good while it lasted.  Mickie James realized she is hurt and ends it with a disqualification.  Mickie James covered up for the butchered end of the match the best she could. 2.5/5 stars

Rob Van Dam vs Shelton Benjamin

This match shows off all of the talent in both of these superstars.  One of, if not the best match of the night.  I think it's the best match of Shelton Benjamin's carreer.  Rob Van Dam also puts on a incredible performance.  In the beggining there are some very creative reversals, and some hard-hitting moves.  One of these outstanding moves includes a Shelton flipping over RVD's head to the outside of the ring, then powerbombing him to the outside.  The match was ecxellent, WWE should definatly realize what talent Benjamin has and give him a big push.  RVD wins.  4.5/5 stars

Big Show vs Kane

A big dissapointment.  These two athletes could put on a great big-man's match, yet they put on a snore-fest.  There are hardly any spots in this match worth watching, and the voices ""in Kane's head"" got annoying after five minutes.  Ends in a no contest after Big Show puts Kane out of his misery with a chair shot.  2/5 stars

HBK vs The McMahon

For some reason, I was expecting more out of this match.  Maybe it was because the Wrestlemania confrontation between the HBK and Mr McMahon was so good.  But don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the match.  Before the match Mr McMahon invites God down to the ring, then declares that it will be a No Holds Barred Match.  One of the better matches of the night.  In the beggining, Shane and Shawn battle up the rampway, and Shawn even does a flying-cross body into Mr McMahon off the stage!  Definatly the better part of the match occurs in the beggining.  After a while the action gets in the ring where Shane puts a beating on Shawn for while.  When Shawn is down and out, Mr McMahon insists that he should tag into the ring.  So he does.  Eventually, Shawn comes back and sweet chin musics both McMahons .  Shawn sets up the  onto two tables, and takes out the 20 foot ladder, but the Spirit Squad interferes.  The Spirit Squad flings Shawn onto a table, and Mr McMahon pins Micheals for the victory.  Pretty good match.  3.5/5 stars.

John Cena vs Triple H vs Edge

Very good main event, met my expectations.  I loved the build up to the match, how all superstars got a victory over one another.  The match is a farly long one, as it should be.  One of the funnier parts of the match is when Triple H and John Cena actually team up for a minute to continuosly bash Edge's head into an announce table.  At one point in the match, Triple H gets busted open pretty bad.  There are some good spots with involving all three superstars during the match.  John Cena ends up winning with a suprise roll-up pin on Triple H.  After the match, Triple H takes out his frustration by delivering Sledge Hammer shots to the Referee, John Cena, and Edge.  A great main event and triple threat match.  4.5/5 stars

Overall, a good single-brand PPV.  This should how all single-brand PPV's are.  I give Backlash 2006 an average 3.5/5 stars.",1153353600,5,4229,4.490765171503957
2527881,4,B000EQ5VJA,"1) chris masters vs carlito

i thought this would be a dumb match, but it was really good, only because of carlito. he did a crossbody to the outside, springboard elbow, top rope moonsault, then a backcracker for the win- 4.5/5, after maria says masters won, later she corrects herself

winner:carlito

2) umaga vs ric flair

umaga destroys flair with his typical moves, he's an good wrestler, but that samoan spike is dumb, which is how he won- 3/5

winner: umaga

3) women's title- trish stratus vs mickie james (champ)

this match was ok in the beginning because trish was beating mickie down with all her signature moves, but then she got hurt when going over the top rope and trying to hold on to the apron, causing her arm to bend. so mickie choked her out to get DQed, she lost but is still champ- 3/5

winner: trish but mickie retains title

4)money in the bank and intercontinental title- winner takes all

RVD vs Shelton Benjamin (champ)

it was kind of slow in the begining, shelton is in a arm wrench, hammerlock and he reverses by bouncing off the ropes with his legs. shelton does a sunset flip powerbomb to Rvd to the outside. rvd goes for the rolling thunder, but shelton reverses into a samoan drop. 3rd time was a charm when rvd landed the rolling thunder. shelton kicked out of the split-legged moosault. rvd went fo a monkey flip, but shelton landed on his feet. shelton had the suitcase, rvd countered with a vandaminator, from their the 5-star and the win- 3.5/5

winner: new champ and still has the money RVD

5) big show vs kane

they had a typical normal strength match, but that music came on and kane went insane bouncing his head into the turnbuckle, show put him out of his misery with a chair shot, no one wins- 3/5

winner: no contest

6) tag or handicap match as shawn tries to explain- god and shawn michaels vs the McMahon's

it was funny with backstage with vince doing miracles, with candice, and the walking on water, the flying fish and bread. and then having god come out to disco music to boogie and the ref was supposed to check him. but then vince changed the match to NO HOLDS BARRED. shawn was dominating in the beginning, they were on the stage, and shawn did a crossbody to vince off the stage through the floor. when he went to get up, shane hit him with a chair. they bloodied him up real good, but shawn started coming back and gaining momentum, then got a sweet chin music on both of them. put them on 2 tables, went for a 20 ft ladder. while he was on it the spirit squad came out, so he did a flying back elbow onto them. but the odds were too much, and they got the high spirits on him through a table- wow. then the mcMahon's got the cover and the win- 5/5

winners: mcMahon's

7) wwe title- edge vs triple H vs (champ)

all main event triple threat matches for the title in past history have been some of the best matches, except at Wrestlemania 20, and that was known as the best main event ever.and this was no different. at first edge let them go at it and watched, but then cena and hunter started to double team edge, face first into the announce table. cena did a splash to edge, which was different from what he normally does. cena went for a double F-U, but edge got off and speared cena with hunter still on his back- different. edge got an edgecution on hunter on top of the table, but it didn't break. he was bleeding like a stuffed pig now. cena kept on doing STFU's on hunter, the 1st on hunter went for a pedigree, but cena countered, hunter broke it up, the 2nd time edge went to the top and cena went up and for and F-U, and hunter came from underneath and did an electric chair, all falling back- real different. edge got knocked over the barricade by a chair shot from hunter, when lita tried to interfere with a chair, hunter spinebustered her. then he went for a pedigree on cena, he countered with a bridge pin for the win- 5/5, after the match hunter hit them both with a sledghammer and did DX chops.

winner: still champ, cena

This was a great match! I liked the start of pure wrestling. I also liked how both men's athleticism was fused into this match. I was hoping for Benjamin to pull out a surprise victory but it is okay. I would love to see these 2 face off 1 on 1 in a ladder match.

RATING: 89/100

Shawn Michaels & God vs. McMahons

This match was so much better than expected! I loved the fact that it was changed to no holds barred because I knew that would make it possible for another match like their WM one. It was very good throughout and the finish was for me, very unexpected.

RATING: 88/100

This match was going along so nicely with so many possible endings. I was thoroughly enjoying it and was kept on the edge of my seat. However, the fact that Cena won really upset me. The match was still a very good Triple Threat though.

6. No Holds Barred Match: Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon vs. Shawn Michaels and ""God""

A very entertaining match actually that even had some better spots than their wrestlemania match. However the ending annoyed me, with the unbearable spirit squad interfearing once again, which slowed the match down considerably.  Not as good as their wrestlemania match, however very entertaining none-the-less with some nice spots. I'll leave the god appearence up to the viewer to watch, and I won't give it away. ***1/4

Very good performances by all 3 men, even Cena (suprisingly). Even though the ending pissed me off considerably, this was still a fantastic match, and the match of the night no questions asked. ****1/4

Overall this Backlash was good, but the problem is half of the show was excellent and the other half is garbage. Once again, Cena wins leaving a bad taste in my mouth as I think the WWE has used him horribly, which shows considering how horrible he is.  I am beginning to wonder if they are ever going to take the title away from him, and for my sake and hopefully every fan of the WWE's sake, that day will come soon.

  Carlito vs the Masterpiece: The second I said Carlito would win with his feet on the ropes.....he won with his feet on his ropes. I still don't really buy Carlito as a face. I originally thought The Masterpiece was going face when Carlito attacked him. Anyway this is a decent match and is a funny part with Carlito putting the masterlock on the masterpiece. ** 1/2 out of ****

  Umaga vs Ric Flair: One half of 3 minute warning getting pushed where his finisher is where he thoves his thumb in the neck of people and yes he beats the nature boy like that. Is sad that Ric Flair had to put over  a guy who's push probably won't even last long.

 ** out of ****

  Mickie James vs Trish: They had a better match at WM. Here Trish hurts her arm and Mickie gets herself disqualified so not much here.

** out of ****

  RVD vs Shelton with Money in the bank and the IC title on the line: This is the best match like I said. There's a lot of action and this is RVD's best match in awhile since the WWE actually gives him enough time to put on a good match. Of course Shelton is no sloach either and this match could've gone anyway. RVD wins by kicking the briefcase in Shelton's face and then giving him the frog splash.

**** out of ****

  Big Show vs Kane: Another match that's  a waste since nothing happens. I mean no one wins anyway. A Red light goes off with a voice saying May 19th and Kane goes nuts and pounds on his head until Show hits him in the head with a chair. Then Show just leaves...

* 1/2 out of ****

  HBK and God...vs Vince and Shane: When it looks like Shawn is gonna win he gets screwed over by those gay cheerleader guys. After they put him through a table Vince makes the pin. That's great, Shawn is jobbing to Vince when HHH who should still be in his shadow is getting World title shot after World title shot... Was no reason for this feud to even to be happening after WM but sadly it was still one of the better matches.

  Edge vs HHH vs Cena: I thought HHH would win this one or even Edge should've won this one instead of Cena. I'm not saying I wanted HHH to win though, he was champ 10 times with-in only what 5 years ? Makes me wish Beniot married Steph...lol. Anyway this is way better than Cena vs HHH at WM. There's a lot of action and a lot of bumps and even Cena wasn't that bad. Edge was the missing igredient at WM, it should've been a 3 way from the start.

2527902,3,B000EQ5VJA,"This was a pretty average pay per view coming off of a fairly disappointing Wrestlemania earlier in the month. There were two excellent matches, one was entertaining if somewhat redundant and excessive in terms of storyline, and everything else was pretty bad. The first excellent match was:

Winner Take All:

(""Money in the Bank"" vs. Intercontinental Champion)

Rob Van Dam vs. Shelton Benjamin

This was the match I was most looking forward to seeing...and it certainly payed off for me. These are two exceptional athletes who can pull off some truly amazing and unique moves, and they really mesh well together. These two also stole the show in the ladder match at WM22. Hopefully we will see more of these type of matches...9/10

The second match which I would call excellent was the main event:

WWE Title Triple Threat Match:

John Cena vs. Triple H vs. Edge

This was 10x better than I thought it would be! After having seen these three in the ring together WAY too much on Raw leading into the match, I thought it would come off as stale. Instead, it was intense and brutal throughout and is right up there with the best triple threat matches (perhaps tied with Mania XX). The action was all over the place, inside and out, with solid wrestling and weapons used. Triple H was busted open worse than almost anybody I've seen! Cena really held his own for once with good counter and submission (okay, only one submission really) wrestling, and probably had one of the best matches of his career....9/10

Other than that, the Michaels vs. McMahons match was decent for what it was. Better than the Mania match, atleast. It wasn't as one sided because Shane was more involved, and they brawled up the ramp and off the stage, which made it more exciting. But it still felt anticlamictic in the end and the pacing was lost with the ""big spot"" set up....7.5/10

Overall, I would buy this for these three matches. All the rest was really a waste, especially the horrid Umaga/Flar match (thank god it only lasted 2 or 3 minutes!) and the laughable Big Show/Kane ending. The backstage segments with McMahon were beyong bizarre and makes me think that maybe he has indeed finally ""lost it.""",1146441600,,2188,4.704188481675392

Carlito vs Masters was a major disapointment to me because I am a HUGE Carlito fan and expected more out of him. The Raw Boogeyman...I mean Umaga squashed Ric Flair in a total waste of time. Kane vs Big Show was crap as well with the red light and May 19 repeated over and over again and ended in DQ which in my view is not a way to have a PPV match. I mean who would want to spend 40.00 for a PPV where a heavely hyped match is short and ends in a DQ? The Womens championship was way too short and ended by DQ. Shawn and ''God'' vs the Mcmahons was the 2nd most dissapointing match on the card because of the Spirit Squad.

Now the WWE Title match. After watching it I was EXTREMELY upset because of John ''Superman'' Cena. I mean why does WWE still sell him as a babyface despite him getting booed to death. To make matters worse he pinned my favorite wrestler HHH to retain by a roll up. I am starting to appreciate the fact that John Cena is going to lose to RVD ( my fourth favorite) at ECW one night stand. Cena fans please hear me out. I know most of you are still just kids like me who just love his gimmick but trust me when you are eleven you get past his crappy gimmick and realize he is no Bret Hart or Chris Benoit.",1146441600,,1408,4.043010752688172

1) Chris Masters vs. Carlito
---This opener is kind of weird, because these two guys are both self-serving cheaters.  However, they actually pull it off in this solid opener.  There's nothing that will go down in history, but the powerful Masters against the unorthodox Carlito makes for a unique match.  What holds this one back is Masters really messes up a few spots.  I love Masters, but tonight he forgets to kick out of a pinfall!  All in all though, this is a good way to start a show.

---I can't say this match was ""good"", but I was somewhat amused by this short bout.  As always, Flair is appealing as the veteran who just won't retire.  Umaga is gonna have to do more work to convince me that he's not a Headshrinker copycat.  Pointless and unnecessary, but not boring.
""5.0 out of 10""

3) Women's Championship
Mickie James (champion) vs. Trish Stratus
---This one hurts very deeply.  I thought these two women's matches at NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION 2006 and WRESTLEMANIA 22 were some the events' best contests.  Trish and Mickie have great chemistry --- both in and out of the ring --- and I loved their psychotic storyline.  But in this match, one bad fall from Trish dislocates her shoulder, and forces Mickie to end the match with a weak disqualification.  Things happen, and I know that Trish's safety was in jeopardy, but that doesn't mean the match is good.

4) Winner-Take-All
Shelton Benjamin (Intercontinental champion)
vs. Rob Van Dam (Money-In-The-Bank winner)
---Even though someone's career push is gonna get hurt, this is a strong athletic match between two exceptional performers.  Things start a little slow, probably because Benjamin and RVD had to use time that the Trish/Mickie bout couldn't fill.  But when things get good, they get REAL good.  Think of it like a Bret Hart contest: deliberately slow, then gradually more exciting.  Both Benjamin and RVD can pat themselves on the back for a job well done.
""7.5 out of 10""
________________________________

5) Kane vs. Big Show
---A very strange match with a dopey storyline.  First about the match - it's uninteresting, it's poorly performed with a lot of botched moves, and the crowd is bored to death.  There is a neat inner-voice gig that forces Big Show to smack Kane with a chair in order to keep his former partner from going insane.  As for the storyline, I'd like to think the WWE is more clever than using this to promote ""See No Evil"" (a slasher flick starring Kane), but the May 19th feud just isn't working for me.
""3.0 out of 10""
________________________________

6) No Holds Barred
Shane and Vince McMahon vs. Shawn Michaels & God
---The best way to summarize this match is that it's a No Disqualification handicap match, with some microphone smack-talk and fancy lighting thrown in.  And guess what else: it's good entertainment!  If you liked HBK/Vince from WRESTLEMANIA 22, you'll love this.  This rematch is more hardcore, as Shane and Vince take some hard smacks, and Michaels releases that old-school cocky DX side of him that we've yearned for.  I had my doubts, but this storyline and match are great fun!
""8.0 out of 10""
________________________________

7) WWE Championship
Edge vs. Triple H vs. John Cena (champion)
---Many fans have booed John Cena to death, but what's odd is we all keep tuning to see if tonight's the night that the champ gets chumped.  Every one of these guys works extra hard to solidify their worth as WWE champion, and this match was so intense and entertaining that I would've been happy with any victor...and I do mean 'ANY' victor.  Considering I thought Cena/HHH at WRESTLEMANIA 22 was a tad disappointing, this one blew me away.  Blood, tables, chairs, sledgehammers, false finishes, close submissions, outside interference, downed referees...these are the ingredients of a strong main event.

OVERALL
BACKLASH 2006 worked well enough for me, but when the DVD is released, I can't give a purchase recommendation to even those who've missed out on the PPV.  There are three very good matches here, but the rest of the evening just sinks so hard that I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth.",1146355200,3,4623,4.895886889460154
2527915,4,B000EQ5VJA,"Backlash 2006 continued the long storyline involving Mr. McMahon and Shawn Michales as well as McMahon's son, Shane. John Cena's first title defense was against two men, and Rob Van Dam put up his MITB contract in an all or nothing match with the intercontinental championship on the line as well against Shelton Benjamin...

Carlito vs. Chris Masters:

I thought it would be good if Carlito and Masters stayed as a team, god knows the WWE needs tag teams. Master's used power moves to try to get Carltio trapt in the Masterlock, but Carlito used his quickness to get away. The end has  Carlito roll up Masters and then use the ropes to help get the pinfall without the ref seeing it. 8/10 [Solid Opener]

Umaga vs. Ric Flair:

Poor Flair, from a healty intercontinental championship reign to jobbing to Umaga. DUD. Umaga wins after his stupid thumb move thing. 2/10

Women's Championship

Mickie James [champion] vs. Trish Stratus:

Not as good as their WM 22 match, but that was because Trish unfortunately hurt herself in the match. Mickie losses after choking Trish with a cord and refusing to let go after the ref called for the bell. 5/10 [would have been better if given more time]

Money In The Bank/Intercontinental Championship Match

Winner Take All

Shelton Benjamin [IC Champion] vs. Rob Van Dam:

One of the top three matches of the night. Both men used wrestling at it's finest. Highlights include a sunset flip by Shelton to RVD outside the ring onto the floor! RVD used his usual moves like the awesome Rolling Thunder and even gave the VanDaminator to Shelton with the briefcase! RVD wins after the Five Star Frog Splash. 10/10

Kane vs. The Big Show:

Power met power as two former dominate tag team champs collided. Big slams and not a lot of fast paced moves took place. Kane's May 19th movie started distracting him again and Big Show cracked a steel chair over Kane's head to snap him out of it. Kane just sat up and laughed it off. 6/10

No Holds Barred/Handicap Match

Vince and Shane McMahon vs. Shawn Michales:

Great match, a lot of weapons and some high spots. The three men fight all over the ramp way and Shawn even gives a cross body to Vince off the stage through a couple of tables! Shane and Vince then ganged up on Shawn, busting him open with a number of weapons.

However Shawn fought back and even pulled out a 25 foot ladder and put it in the ring. The Spirit Squad makes an appearance and Shawn jumped off the ladder onto all five members! In the end the SQ fought back and through Shawn into the air, where he crashed through another table, and Vince pinned him. 9/10

WWE Championship

Triple Threat Match

HHH vs. John Cena [Champion] vs. Edge:

Great triple threat match. All three men fought their hearts out. Highlights include Edge giving a ddt on top of the announce table to HHH. Chairs were even brought into play and HHH gets busted wide open. John Cena even picks up the two other men at the same time in the form of the FU!

In the end Cena got the pin after rolling up HHH, countering the pedigree. 9.5/10

After the match HHH knocked out Edge and Cena [and even the ref] and did some DX crotch chops to end the show.

I would say definately rent this for the Winner take all match, the Triple Threat Match, and the Handicap Match. Even the opening match is worth a look.

This DVD is recommended...",1146355200,,3354,4.51158940397351
2527916,5,B000EQ5VJA,"Triple Threat WWE Title

I only see Cena or Edge winning this match. Trips is going face and doesn't want the title if he did they would've given it to him at Wrestlemania. Plans are to have Cena win the keep the title until ONS2. There were no signs Edge would win the title at New year's Revolution. He would be a great champ and keep the title for a few months. He would also be great in a hardcore match.

Prediction: Edge via pinfall

Shawn Michaels & God vs. McMahons

I think this fued will keep going. I can't see the McMahons winning but I can see one more match. I don't know what it will take for that to happen.

Prediction: Shawn Michaels & God via pinfall

Winner Takes All: RVD vs. Shelton

originally I thought RvD would take both titles. I can't see Shelton winning but I can see hime retaining.

Prediction: RVD by DQ

Kane vs. Big Show

This is a multi-ppv fued will the heel taking the first one.

Prediction: Kane via pinfall

Carlito vs. Chris Masters

Carlito has been on role on the mic and in the ring. Look for him to keep it up with an impressive win.

Prediction: Carlito via pinfall

Umaga vs. Ric Flair

interesting matchup. I think you got see the newcomer going over here.

Prediction: Umaga via pinfall

Women's title: Mickie vs. Trish

Mickie will retain, hopefully they don't stretch out the fued with a DQ.

Prediction: Mickie James via pinfall",1146182400,,1380,4.400793650793651
2527917,4,B000EQ5VJA,"Umaga Vs Ric Flair - I thought it was gonna be some squash guy going against Umaga but seeing as it is flair, I think the 16 time champ will come through. 6/10

Mickie James vs Trish Stratus - Mickie because fans don't want to see Trish champ again because she was for such a long time. (Remind you of anyone? Can anyone say Cena? lol) I see this match being ok nothing great.  3/10

Carlito vs Masters - I see Carlito coming on top, maybe breaking the masterpiece.  Seems as if they want to give a push to either one of these guys.  Should be a good match, 7/10

Kane vs Bigshow - Hopefully this angle that Kane played back then doesn't go away.  May 19th something ""big"" could happen, like Kane jumping to smackdown or just his movie comes out and they are trying to sell it to fans.  Which would suck.  I see this match being hard hitting maybe a bump or two througha table.  8/10 Kane winning

HBK and ""God"" vs Shane and Vince - HBK will be on his own, though I see someone coming to his aid, perhaps HUnter, because of the signs, (DX) we keep seeing.  Maybe an interference by Cena or Shelton to help.  Don't know, this is a match Im anticipating to watch.  8/10  With HBK coming out on top.

RVD vs Shelton - Should be 2nd to best match of the night.  1 being the main event.  Alot of action, high flying moves, and RVD coming out ontop and cashing in at ECWONS.  10/10

Main Event, Edge vs Cena Vs Triple H- I love Triple H as the dominant face getting the respect by fans and playing to the crowd, it's great.  Im glad they threw in Edge, he is excellent on the mic how he dissed HUnter and Cena.  Cena has been ok on mic, usually his mic skills are decent, whatever happened to him rapping? lol what a loser.  Alot of ppl see Cena coming out on top because Vince wants to keep fans pissed and tune in to boo him and watch him.  I don't know, I see this going either way.  The realistic version, cena winning and going against RVD at ECWONS, what Id want is someone to take that title off his ass lol and bring back the OLD BELT that had honor and history.  Not the toy toy belt.  10/10 match. Either way",1146096000,,2112,4.100244498777506

Damn cool opener, but I could see where punches weren't connecting and when they were talkin their next move to each other and stuff (especially when Carlito flies to the outside, and they are both on the floor). Decent match though. Best they were going to get out of them. ***

2 > Ric Flair vs Umaga
I blinked and it was over. Ok ok, Flair is getting a bit old, but this was harsh him getting squashed to death by ""Jamal Gone Crazy"". Fair bout. **1/4

3 > Womens Title: Trish Stratus vs Mickie James (c)
Trish botches up a move so the match got cut short, and I was a bit confused that the match ended early, I thought everything was fine. My bad. No way as good as Mania 22. Really wasn't expecting it to get better than that though. Unless they wrestled in lingerie :D. **

4 > IC Title vs MITB: RVD (MITB) vs Shelton Benjamin (c)
Went slow at first, but then went freaking cool. So much madness, and spontaneous moves, it was everything it lived up to be. Well worth the wait. ***3/4

5 > Big Show vs Kane
Since I'm from England, I had to stay up alte to watch this, and I fell asleep watching this match, due to it being beyond bad, and then woke up when a ""May 19th"" thing happened, which Big Show sorted out. What a poor ass match. Let down the entire PPV. *

6 > HBK & God vs The McMahons
Really funny entrance for God, ""WWE Style"" as Vince put it. The match was entertaining throughout, tonnes of spots and stuff, then I was hoping HHH would come out and help HBK, but no, and the Suck Squad came out and did a SICK move on HBK through a table. Otherwise, cool match. ***1/2

7 > WWE Title: Cena (c) vs HHH vs Edge
One fo the best Triple Threats ever. I was on the edge of the sofa watching this at one point, since I was hoping HHH would reverse the STFU, and then HHH trying to nail the pedigree on Cena. As an ANTI-Cena, I was thoughrly hoping he wouldn't win, and I nearly got my wish. Stupid way to end a damn fine match though. HHH should have won it. I will give Cena his due though, for nearly F-Uing both men at the same time etc, but I felt Edge was kind of taken advantage of in this match which was annoying. ****3/4

Overall, it's a one match show really, because you can't watch the HBK match with the same thought as the Triple Threat. The main event was perfect. Don't buy the DVD though. Find another way to get the main even :p",1144800000,,2385,4.061702127659575

1) Carlito v. Chris Masters: This was an o.k. match. It really wasn't ppv quality. I believe if the fued between these two had lasted longer, this would have been a good match. More of a match that should've been on RAW. Carlito wins.

2)Ric Flair v. Umaga: This was the worst match of the night. The match was just a way to get Umaga noticed. There was no good story line for this match and they really didn't do well together. Now, I'm a fan of Flair, but this was not anywhere near one of his best matches. Umaga wins.

3)Trish Stratus v. Mickie James (Women's Championship): This was a good match. It wasn't as good as their match at Wrestlemania 22, but it was still good. A great story line led up to this match and Trish and Mickie really worked well together. This would have been better, but Trish got injured early in the match. Trish wins by DQ, but Mickie is still the champ.

4)Rob Van Dam v. Shelton Benjamin (I.C. Championship & Money in the Bank contract on rhe line): This was a great match. It featured great wrestling moves and RVD and Benjamin really worked well together. This was a classic wrestling match(it was even in the History of the Intercontinental Championship DVD). RVD wins.

5)Big Show v. Kane: The big story going into this match was Kane being obsessed with May 19th. Overall, this was an o.k. match. However, there was no winner.

6)Vince & Shane McMahon v. Shawn Michaels & God: No, God was not really in this match. It was really a 2 on 1 handicap match. The big suprise is that Vince made it a No Holds Barred match which is what really made this match great. There was a lot of action and high impact moves. One was when Shawn threw Shane up against a peice of the set and almost makes it fall. However, the biggest moment of the match and the entire event is when Shawn and Vince go flying off the stage! Later on in the match, the Spirit Squad interferes and puts Shawn through a table allowing Vince and Shane to win.

7) Edge w/ Lita v. Triple H v. John Cena (WWE Championship): This was a great main event. These three beat the crap out of each other. In the end, John wins. But then Triple H hits both Edge and John Cena with a sledgehammer.

This isn't the best ppv of 2006, but there are great matches and moments during it. The main reason to buy this ppv in for the last two matches.",1246752000,,2378,4.292410714285714
