8012619,4,B0001HAGUG,"I'm not a big fan of the movie 50-Packs.  Most are throw-away losers and not worth the price no matter how cheap.  But this 100-Pack of old cartoons is a pretty good deal.  The modern cartoons in production today are so pathetically abysmal that I won't let my grandkids watch them.  In their effort to be politically correct and multicultural they've managed to take out all the humor.  I show the kids these old gems and they love them.  Kids are smart enough to know that no one is really getting hurt and it's all for fun.

As with all these multi-packs, be ready for some sub-standard audio/video quality.  These are not digitally remastered.  But for the price they are enjoyable and your kids can see cartoons that are actually funny.  Beware that the ""Tom & Jerry"" listed on the pack is not the cat and mouse series that everyone is familiar with.  This Tom & Jerry series is from the 1930s and is about two men.  There is still a lot of good stuff here for the price.

(I would also recommend the Looney Tunes Classics that are available at Amazon.  These are many of the Warner Brothers cartoons that have been remastered with great results.)",1167091200,2,1152,4.502415458937198
8012620,2,B0001HAGUG,"I live in Australia and this sort of public domain stuff is available on DVD for about $1.50 US, and U know you can get them for $1 at bnricks and mortar stores in the US, so even the $26  price tag for 10 public domain DVDs is hardly impressive.

I'd say there's maybe 2 DVD's total of good stuff here, but chances are you have most of it somewhere else if you have many PD compilations. The cover is misleading too, with its highlighting Betty Boop and Felix. There are 4 Betty Boops, and just 1 Felix - and that's not even a Fleischer, but a mediocre Famous studios one. The saving graces are a healthy serving of Popeye (though again, nearly all (if not all) later Famous Studios stuff - which is probably the best stuff Famous ever did, but that's not saying much.

There is also a decent amount of Van Beuren's Tom and Jerry, though I've seen more extensive and better selections elsewhere for less, and the couple of Toonerville Trolley cartoons are a nice pickup. Apart from that there is probably 7 or 8 DVDs worth of material which varies from watchable to awful;  the bottom of the barrel being the Hoffnung Orchestra stuff, which is just utterly excruciatingly awful, and doesn't even have the excuse of being all that old. If you've never seen a giraffe in blackface, check out 'Camptown Races'. Or the excruiatingly bad Molly Moo Cow from VB.

A friend gave me this, and I'm glad I have it is, as there a few gems in there, and if I didn't have the Popeye stuff, it might be worth it just for that, but let's face it, this is a thrown together compilation of mostly mediocre to poor PD cartoons, and even at $26.99 it's not really cheap. If you don't mind paying... say $9 per disc for reasonably decent, unrestored PD cartoons, and getting 7 DVDs of mostly rubbish thrown in, fair enough.

Check out your $1 stores first.

Decent packaging though.",1159228800,,1862,4.426900584795321
8012621,4,B0001HAGUG,"If you like to sit back and remember the first cartoons then this pack is for you. There are so many cartoons on so many disks that your kids won't be bored for days and most of the memorable old cartoons are on here, like Heckle & Jeckyl etc. so you will watch them too.

Just remember alot of these are in black and white (because obviously they are old cartoons) and you can hardly hear most of them, so your speakers will have to be up! At least i had to turn my speakers way up...

Lots of old memories ran through my head watching popeye and Felix the Cat!",1153008000,,562,4.054054054054054
8012622,4,B0001HAGUG,"i own many of these mega pack collections and i must say i like this one. like i said these are older cartoons(some in black and white) and to be sure not political correct(racial sterotypes and the like), but some of these are very good and even my two boys have found some of them very funny.

if you don't mind all that is stated above you will like this collection. most of the transfers are good but remember these are not cartoons seen very often and as such they are not as well taken care of as tom and jerry and the looney tunes are.",1146009600,4,542,4.113207547169812
8012623,4,B0001HAGUG,"Large box with 12 double sided DVD's each in it's own cardboard sleeve.

As stated before the Tom & Jerry cartoons are not the cat and mouse but 2 men instead. The New Three Sttoges are cartoons only with no live action in them.

Adult cartton buffs (such as myself) will like this set but todays children may not as many of these cartoons were made for an adult audience. Better to get todays kids cartoon sets made by Warner Brothers with characters such as Bugs Bynny, Daffy Duck & Tweety...",1140480000,7,494,4.417582417582418
8012624,5,B0001HAGUG,"i have reviewed many of these mega movie packs and have found all of them enjoyable. this set of cartoons is very different than what you may think these old cartoons are aimed at adults , not that they are nasty or profane just a little off the cuff with some of their jokes. the way things are today some of them wouldn't get made. that said after you put your kids to bed check some of these old cartoons out and you will not be sorry. as always ifv you are looking for great transfers don't pick this one out but if you like old cartoons and would like to see some that you won't see anywhere else give this a try",1136505600,4,617,4.024390243902439
8012625,5,B0001HAGUG,"I am loving the DVD scene. Production costs have obvisously gone low enough that Public Domain releases are coming into their own. And that's what this is: a collection of old cartoons that are in the Public Domain. Which means pretty much stuff you haven't seen before.

This is not a set for children. Society has changed so much that we are just Not Allowed to think some of the thoughts that went into the jokes in these cartoons. Which means there is a subversive quality to this collection, which means it needs to exist.

Some of these cartoons are simply bad. Some are very interesting. There are 4 Hoffnung Symphony Orchestra cartoons from the Halasz-Batchelor studio in England, designed for a very specialized audience but which I'm glad to have seen.

I'm amused that someone said that the Tom and Jerry cartoons are the only ""real"" cartoons in this box, since these Tom and Jerrys have nothing at all to do with the cat and mouse. They are amusing, though.

The fun in this set is discovering something that I've never seen before (which means it will be a while before I get around to the Popeyes and other ""famous"" cartoons). Like I said, some of these are simply bad, but a lot are simply amazing in a ""what kind of drugs were they on in the 1930s"" way. There's no way I would watch more than one disc at a sitting, and there's no way I would inflict these on a child. But I'm having fun with this set.

Being a Public Domain release, basically it's put together from whatever old films they could find. Don't expect digital restoration. But the transfers are for the most part clean and clear, lightyears ahead of what we were getting on PD VHS tapes.",1121558400,35,1668,4.491749174917492
8012626,3,B0001HAGUG,"Who can complain at about $0.25 per cartoon? So they aren't all 'classics', and maybe most kids of today won't like them. But if you're a bit older (39, I must confess ;), still can enjoy cartoons, and are interested in more than just the topfavorites, then you can like quite a few of these 100 cartoons.
