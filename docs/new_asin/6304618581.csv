901810,5,6304618581,...If you do these videos CORRECTLY & CONSISTENTLY alongwith PROPER nutrition/cardio you will get great results. If you do the video BUT continue to eat junk & do no cardio you will get no results! After I did it my boyfriend went crazy because my booty was so nice! hehe,965088000,10,271,4.44
901871,3,6304618581,"ok, i used these tapes for about a week-- already, they're warping (and apparently i'm not the first person to experience this).  the workouts are good for what they are.  you will feel the burn, but don't expect quick & dramatic results from 8 minutes.  the abs workout is most challenging for me, mostly because it puts a lot of strain on the neck (at least it does for me-- maybe i'm doing something horribly wrong), so my neck muscles were sore after the first couple of times.  now i just cheat-- i put my hands in the back of my head for some of the moves instead of leaving them at my side.  that helps.  re: the buns workout, it's good, but (and again, this might just be me-- i have sensitive skin...), my living room is carpeted, and since most of the moves are floor moves, my forearms started to get really irritated after a few workouts.  also, there's really no ""counting"" in the tapes, really-- you just do the move for 45 seconds or a minute or whatever.  the people in the tape do them at different paces.  for me, it's confusing, although i can see how that flexibility is useful for beginners who need to go a bit slower.  i'd say the workouts are an ok bargain-- they go by fast, and the moves are good.  for real results, though, combine them with other workouts or activities.  i don't think it's realistic to expect too much from an 8-minute workout...",1119398400,,1375,4.3700787401574805
901872,5,6304618581,"Hello iam a second time buyer of these wonderful videos they are so easy to follow and the time is such a plus and not only that all the extras on the dvd i got helps me to push my self to other types of workouts! i would recomend these to everyone they really do work as stated in the work out them self, i have had them going on 6 weeks and i am starting to see results!! and i pass them to friends and share them also by word of mouth ..with that all i can say is iam glad i found this website and the videos......thank you",1045526400,3,526,3.790909090909091
901873,5,6304618581,"I had a baby in April of 2001, and I was  up  to 192 pounds (also i'm only 5'3!),so I tried the ab roller thing and other stuff and it didn't really do much for me. I mean I lost some weight, but I didn't get the results I wanted. In July of 2002, My mom bought me the 8 Minute Workout tapes so I started doing it and I got results so fast it amazed me!! I was a size 12, now I'm a size 7 and I weigh 118 pounds!!! I never thought it would worked but I was proved wrong.",1042416000,2,470,3.5533980582524274
901874,4,6304618581,"amazingly this 1994 set of tapes is a lot of fun, and i am feeling results in two weeks. I use the quick fix Pilates tape to warm up, then do 8 min abs, then buns, then  crawl to the shower. The physical quality of the tape is suspect, mine does not rewind well, I suspect i will be replacing in a month or so. I am seeing results, and feeling better. Just 8 mins does make a difference!",1036972800,5,387,3.8987341772151898
901875,5,6304618581,"If you're new to weights and/or exercise, if you're overweight or out of shape, if you have a physical challenge, or if you just want something quick and effective to tone your arms and buns, this is an excellent video.
You'll get a very effective upper body workout with the arms part. It is, admittedly, a bit short. I find I don't always get more than 8 reps in the one set. That's not really enough for most people. But if you use a five pound weight at least and do this twice a week, you'll firm up. And remember, you can use this as a nice start for another set or two with heavier weights on your own if you like.
This is a no-nonsense workout. It's well presented and timed. It's not for everyone. But it is effective if it fits your needs and time constraints. I suggest you warm up for about five minutes before you do either or both of these workouts.
The buns workout is very good and effective too. If you have bad knees, you may want to adjust some of the exercises like the deep knee lunge. Know your limits and work within them. But if you do these exercises, you'll slim down.
I suggest you do either or both of these twice a week if you can.
I highly recommend this video.",1010448000,6,1191,4.182608695652174
901876,3,6304618581,"i have been on doing this workout for nearly 2 months now. and it has given me some results though not much for the lower abs.  it was not as hard as i thought it would be.
  the buns excersice it absolutely horrible to do the position gives me a shoulder pain and seems more targeted for the legs than the butt.even now i find it hard to complete the buns video.",1003104000,,363,4.013888888888889
901877,5,6304618581,This workout is difficult when you start but never gets to easy to be useful!  I lost 5 inches from my waist in less than 6 months not to mention how much firmer my back half got!  It is much easier to squeeze 16 minutes into my day than it was to find room for fitness equipment and the time to use it!  This video is definately worth the money and effort!,1002499200,,357,3.9305555555555554
901878,4,6304618581,"I thought that this might be the ""easy"" way to get a flat stomach. Well, it is getting there, but easy is not how I would put it! It is a quick workout that does produce results, but you have to work into it! I would recommend it to anyone that does not have alot of time to work on the abs and wants to see some improvement",989539200,,324,3.7794117647058822
901879,5,6304618581,"Probably the best workout video I own. The variation of exercises in the 8 minutes of each featured workout makes the time fly yet you feel the burn. When I first started, I thought how will I ever be able to do this? With determination, in 3 short weeks I wear 10 pound ankle weights to keep the resistance up. I would have never believed how fast this workout would have toned anyone up. As other reviews state, you can feel the tightness in your jeans and see the 6 pack in the tee shirt. Highly recommend!",978048000,30,509,4.257731958762887

7874801,3,6304618581,"Actually, I really need to return one of the tapes.  In fact, I did order one of them a couple of years ago and, while I still have it, the audio on that was bad because it was garbled  The eight minute abs one is fine but the 8 Min Buns tape, the audio is horrible.  I rarely shop on Amazon  or online at all.  I guess because of these issues.  What's my next step?",1443830400,,366,3.8133333333333335

Definitely worth all five stars.",1245974400,,85,4.733333333333333
7874809,4,6304618581,"16 minutes, that's all it takes!  This is great for me because I have no attention span and no time.  Everyone can find 16 minutes to work out and you actually feel the burn!  Workouts are easy and quick, which makes me more likely to do it.  My only complaint is the routine gets sort of dull after awhile.  It would be nice if there were several different routines and could be rotated.  Either way, this video is very good!  And hey, for like $6, why not?!",1239408000,,459,4.206896551724138
