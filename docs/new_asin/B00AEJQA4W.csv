8550605,1,B00AEJQA4W,"I picked this movie up (new) with 4 others for $5, and I watched the trailer and was shocked to see it was shot in Pittsburgh (where I live).. I immediately noticed how cheaply made it was, and the acting and writing is positively terrible. I've come to expect that when a movie is bad on paper, I think these studios say ""let's film it in Pittsburgh!"".. All three stars; Ving, Pam & Patrick are way past their prime, and it certainly shows. The whole cast is hideous looking, and every scene is shot ugly. I think the funniest part of the movie, aside from the horribly jack'd up hair styles, is showcasing the city like it's huge and hardcore. It seems like it was such a hard task to accomplish that the majority of outside scenes are all blurry, and the inside scenes are dark (probably to hide the actor's bad makeup). Don't get me wrong, there are really bad crime-ridden sections of the city, but from what I saw and recognize, they didn't shoot anywhere near there..Last I checked, Sq. Hill is not thug central. lol",1462665600,,1023,4.446808510638298

8550611,5,B00AEJQA4W,It was really great lots of action and Ving Rhames is always great no matter what he does.  Very hot girl in it as well,1364688000,,119,3.76
8550612,1,B00AEJQA4W,"This film had the makings of a 5 star grindhouse. Ving Rhames is Renzo Wes the bad guy. He is tailed by Pam Grier who shoots a gun now instead of using mock karate moves. Robert Patrick is her partner. Renzo runs a strip club with the great looking Heather Rae Young dancing on tables. The soundtrack is 70's R&B rifts. And the film had a twist to it. Killing galore. What was not to like?

The execution was seriously bad. The plot went everywhere and nowhere. The lines were terrible and the actors were simply reading them, going through the motions. Ryan Combs couldn't direct a compass to point north. Heather Rae Young is great to look at, but couldn't deliver a line if her life depended on it. Pam Grier now has to rely on her acting ability instead of her looks to get by, and this script didn't help any. The twist was odd and didn't make much sense. Blue eyed Melanie Marden plays the sister of Ving Rhames which had me scratching my head. What was with the poorly developed religion aspect?

Renzo is supposed to be psychotic, and while that plays into the script, it was not developed.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, brief nudity.

Note to self: Stay away from Ryan Combs movies.",1363996800,5,1194,4.463302752293578
