Ultimate 8 is a great piece of SW but really takes time to learn so I thought that this DVD would help.  While it did show me a few things, to me it wasn't worth the money.",1201132800,,296,3.609375
8126555,5,B000FTTD40,"I received this video 2 days after I ordered it and it is excelent!

It covers everything in Vegas Movie Studio, (which by the way applied just fine to my Vegas 7 + DVD) and also Vegas Architect. It was worth every penny and very professionally well done

If you are new to Vegas Movie Studio, Vegas 7 + DVD or Vegas Architect, buy it!",1177113600,,335,4.138461538461539
8126556,5,B000FTTD40,"This tutorial covers both Vegas Movie Studio + DVD 6 & 7 includeing the platinum version. It is a teriffic time saver and unless you have a fair amount of experance with editing software it is invalueable. It visually unlocks the how and why's that frankly would take the begenner many hours to figure out. HDV, DV editing, color correction and DVD authoring are clearly described along with too many other features to describe, and you can follow along step buy step and be useing most of the extensive features in a few hours. For me their is nothing like the ""show me method"" to learning. And that is what this does. As valuable as the software itself.",1166832000,6,655,4.559322033898305
