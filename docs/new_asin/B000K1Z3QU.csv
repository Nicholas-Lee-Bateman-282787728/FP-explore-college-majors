8153918,5,B000K1Z3QU,"This is a fun VHS tape.  Old-school fans will like it since the tape will bring back lots of memories for them, and newer fans will be surprised at how much WWF women's wrestling has changed over the past 20 years.  All the matches from this tape are long before the era of ""pudding"" and ""evening gown"" matches, and the women back then were hired more for their wrestling abilities than for their looks and bust size.
  The first match on the tape is the infamous match between the masked Spider Lady and the WWF women's champion, Wendi Richter.  This bout took place in 1985 at Madison Square Garden.  This match is still remembered among many fans since it featured a ""screw job"" ending...Richter lost the belt and match that night without expecting to do so.  The ref does a fast three count despite the fact that her shoulders are clearly not on the mat.  A similar scenario happened 12 years later to Bret Hart in Montreal.  This was Richter's final WWF match ever.  Richter ripped off the Spider Lady's mask to reveal former WWF champion, the Fabulous Moolah.
  The tape then goes on to feature several Moolah title matches, including a bout against Debbie Combs and two matches against Sherri Martel.  The first of the two Martel matches features Moolah losing the title to Martel.  You have to give Moolah credit...she was in her mid 60s at the time these matches took place, and she takes bumps like someone half her age.
  The tape also features two women's tag team title matches (yes, there was such a title at one point) between the Glamour Girls (Judy Martin and LeiLani Kai who were managed by Jimmy Hart) and Japan's Jumping Bomb Angels.  These two bouts alone are worth the price of the tape.  The Angels were doing Hardy Boyz style moves 20 years before Matt and Jeff were doing them.  The latter of the 2 bouts took place at the first Royal Rumble.
  The tape ends with one more title match featuring Sensational Sherri taking on Desiree Petersen.  The tape features a few segments with Mean Gene Okerlund, Fabulous Moolah, Sensational Sherri, and Jimmy Hart.
  Bring back some memories or create some new ones and purchase this tape!",1182470400,,2153,4.634920634920635
