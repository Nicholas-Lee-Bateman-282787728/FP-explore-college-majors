2456579,5,B000CCD1SO,"I love this series. Both sets are great. I do like set two better. I find that second seasons often seem better than the first. The actors maybe more relaxed, who knows. I just can not stop revisiting these stories. I only wish there was a third season.",1154736000,27,253,4.291666666666667
2456580,5,B000CCD1SO,"Having read all of Ngaio Marsh, Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie to name the most well known British mystery authors (Marsh is a native New Zealander) I rate Sayers # 1, Marsh #2 and Christie #3. Having watched all the available BBC renditions of Christie and Sayers and now the first for me of Marsh(I started with set 2) My opinion is that they have caught the essence of Marsh very well. If anything in a couple of the ones in this set the early melodrama is a bit heavy, not in character with what I recall of the books. However the portrayal of Inspector Alleyn and Troy agree with the low key ""veddy British"" behavior one woiuld expect from a Scotland Yard Inspector from the privileged class and his artist paramour. Perhaps some of the reviewers of set 1, which I am getting, but not viewed yet, who think the performances too stodgy have been watching too much shoot-em up American TV with no plot, just sex and violence. The settings of the ones we have viewed to date are outstanding and the character portrayal has been suberb. Much more depth than is possible in say a Christie story.

I rate these Inspector Alleyn five stars as well done completely true to the Ngaio Marsh intent. If you do not like the books don't buy the the videos, if you do like the books, then by all means get the videos.",1143417600,67,1312,4.421487603305785

2456593,5,B000CCD1SO,"My husband and I just love British Mysteries.  Un like the United States they are more concerned with quality instead of quantity,  They may not have a new show every week, but what they have is worth the wait.  I just love having the purchased set because I can watch on my schedule.  Our local PBS does not always shoe all episodes of particular mystery sets.  Buying them means there are no restrictions.  There can be an Inspector Allen Mystery marathon whenever I want.",1397174400,,474,4.583333333333333

Written by the highly acclaimed mystery writer Naio Marsh, the BBC Inspector Allen Mysteries are intriguing and highly entertaining.  Roderick Allen, deftly played by Patrick Malahide, is a Chief Inspector at Scotland Yard.  Allen is a polished gentleman of aristocratic breeding who has close connections with British high society making it possible for him to investigate sensitive cases with diplomacy and tact while pursuing criminals with relentless determination.  He is ably assisted by Detective Inspector Fox, played by William Simons, and supported by Allen's lady friend, a very accomplished and collected artist, Agathy Troy, played by Belinda Lang.

Set 2 contains four episodes on four nicely boxed DXDs all in a larger box.  Each is 98 minutes long, a little over one and a half hours.

Episode 1, Death in a White Tie, opens in a coming out party for London's aristocrat debutantes.  But a black mailer is operating in the background and soon blackmail results in murder.

Episode 2, Hand in Glove, takes place in a quiet village.  Guests at a luncheon party provide a broad spectrum of suspects when the theft of a treasured piece of jewelry turns to murder.

Episode 3, Scales of Jusice, turns a dieing mans request that the book he has written on his life is published into a complex murder case. The case involves protection of social position and pride.

Episode 4, Dead Water, takes place on the Scottish island of Portacarrick, where the attempt by a group of the residences to generate visitor attention, and income, from the overly claimed and promoted curing powers of a stream of spring water, result in murder.  At the end of the episode Roderick Allen proposes to Agathy Troy.

If you enjoyed Set 1 you will definitely enjoy Set 2.  If you haven't seen Set 1 you should also buy it, they are both delightfully enjoyable.",1371081600,,2119,5.4176829268292686

2456597,3,B000CCD1SO,"Entertaining if you are stuck in a house with 30 in of snow outside. Interesting mysteries, but the lead actor is bit dull.",1360454400,,123,4.391304347826087
2456598,4,B000CCD1SO,"""Hand in Glove"" features John Gielgud playing his usual slightly nuts but impeccably proper self as Percival Pyke-Period, a name sure to give one pause in the social register.  Surrounded by ruffians in his stately manor, his serenity is disturbed by a body found in a ditch where repairmen have been working.  It doesn't matter if it's someone he doesn't particularly care for.  One does not appreciate a disruption of the social order.  Toss in some art forgery, blackmail and crazy relatives, and you're set for fun.  Oh yes, watch out for the dog.

""Death in a White Tie"" brings us to an elite family planning their daughter's coming out party.  It's going to be quite expensive, but everybody who is anybody will be there...including some unsavory types they'd rather do without.  Inspector Alleyn is in his milieu with the upper crust but he needs help from a dear old friend who will go unnoticed as they try to track down a blackmailer.  You'll like the ballroom, the ladies in Cinderella gowns, one rather questionable ""mutton dressed as lamb"" American actress, and Brits getting into mischief and bad company.

""Dead Water"" is a strange tale where a cult has found it profitable to advertise the healing powers of Pixie Falls.  The rightful landowner, Emily Pride, is aghast at the potential to harm truly sick people with such claims, especially for profit.  She's an old friend of Inspector Alleyn, and consults him when some rather ugly threats are made.  He's supposed to be on vacation with his beloved Agatha Troy.  Well, forget that idea.

""Scales of Justice"" brings us into the realm of some dark secrets from the war.  And here we thought it was over.  It's all in a manuscript with a missing chapter.  A nice assortment of screwballs to the manor born and peculiar neighbors provide lots of colorful interaction, almost to the point where you lose track of what the real mystery is.  Shoes, snoopy cats, naughty golf, careless archery, angry fishing -- they all leave a trail for the Inspector to follow.",1358294400,2,2024,4.814492753623188
2456599,5,B000CCD1SO,"These programs are as good now as when I first saw them. The acting is good, especially Brer Fox. The best video is Death in a White Tie, and it is the reason I bought the DVD's in the first place. The only caveat I have is Troy appears in some videos and not in the books.",1316476800,,273,3.807017543859649
2456600,2,B000CCD1SO,"I almost always love Brit mysteries, but I guess I got spoiled on ""Morse"" and ""Lewis"" and ""Peter Whimsey.""  I could not get ""into"" Inspector Alleyn Mysteries though I really tried.  For me, he has very little personality, intensity and pizazz as do the others I mentioned.  I am definitely in the minority I know, but just had to mention how disappointed I am with this series.  O well -",1288569600,3,387,4.485714285714286
2456621,5,B000CCD1SO,A most enjoyable set of DVDs. My wife and I are big fans of Ngaio Marsh and these shows are faithful to the stories,1274572800,,115,3.8333333333333335
2456622,5,B000CCD1SO,"I've always loved Ngaio Marsh's Inspector Alleyn mysteries and caught some of them on PBS' ""Mystery.""  I think Patrick Malahide is an amazing actor in how easily he can make you believe he is his character.  I own both series now and watch them at least once a year.  Alleyn and Lord Peter Wimsey are my favorite English gentlemen detectives.  I also approve the the Agatha Troy actress.  You can believe the attraction between the two, even tho it's so terribly understated.  I wish they had made all the books into movies!",1253232000,,524,4.641304347826087
2456623,5,B000CCD1SO,Nicely done - a real find for mystery fans.  I was sorry when the series ended.,1252713600,,79,3.9375
2456624,5,B000CCD1SO,I have both Inspector Alleyn Mysteries and I love them.  Actually I think set 2 is better than set 1.,1230681600,,101,4.05
2456625,5,B000CCD1SO,I love this series of Inspector Alleyn of Scotland Yard.  I enjoy the main character with his quiet ways and the lack of blood and gore,1221609600,2,135,4.1923076923076925
2456626,5,B000CCD1SO,"Here we have the second set in the BBC series, starring Patrick Malahide as the aristocratic Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn, William Simons as Detective Inspector Fox, and Belinda Lang as Alleyn's fianc and renowned artist, Agatha Troy. The setting for these great Ngaio Marsh mysteries is England, portions being wedged in time between the two great wars but mostly a few years beyond that era.

These four color films on DVD are at least as entertaining as the first set and I was very pleased with the overall quality. They run 98 minutes each and the aspect is 4:3, full-screen. All the films were produced in the early 1990s.

In ""Scales of Justice,"" (Jim Goddard, director), a retired military man is murdered as he casts for ""The Old-un"" along his favorite trout stream. Just prior to his demise, he had been charged with publishing the memoirs of a recently dead associate and those scandalous writings cause an entire family to clam up as Chief Inspector Alleyn tries to solve the murder. This is a really top mystery, conveyed with beautiful cinematography and plenty of British aristocratic atmosphere.

""Dead Water,"" (John Woods, director), takes place on a scenic Scottish Island where a ""magic waterfall"" is becoming renowned for having restored health to people from their otherwise incurable diseases. To add to the legend, a ""green lady"" is said to haunt the mists of the falls. The local community tries to exploit their good fortune, commercializing the wondrous H2O in every possible way but the leaseholder of the property, a determined old spinster, means to disrupt any pecuniary benefits for the islanders. Chief Inspector Alleyn fears that her demise is inevitable and rushes to her rescue but, once there, he has to investigate murder.

""Death in a White Tie"" (John Woods, director), transpires entirely in London, urban scenery prevailing. Up against a case of blackmail, Chief Inspector Alleyn asks an elderly aristocratic friend to do some snooping as he makes his rounds of the debutante balls and art gallery receptions. But when the friend turns up murdered, an enraged Alleyn tosses out all the rules to solve both cases, as they appear to be connected.

A weird and dysfunctional family is the focus of ""Hand in Glove,"" (Martyn Friend, director), and Chief Inspector Alleyn is called in when one of the clan is murdered. At the same time, Alleyn's right hand man, Inspector Fox, discovers a hidden cache of faked paintings during the raid of an unlicensed nightclub - these paintings are of special interest to Alleyn since the originals were painted by his off-and-on fianc, Agatha Troy! Of course, clues discovered during the investigation of each case ultimately bring them together as one.

For British mystery/cozy murder fans, ""Dead Water"" takes first place, ""Scales of Justice"" is second, ""Hand in Glove"" third, and, ""Death in a White Tie"" last, albeit the least of the four is still very good. These film versions of Marsh's works are clearly conveyed with the original stories in mind.

The excellence of this set well-deserves my highest rating.",1204761600,16,3090,5.0234375
2456627,5,B000CCD1SO,"I cannot add to the good things that have been printed here by other reviewers. Although the DVD set indicates closed captioning is available, I can't get it on my TV. We need CC because our 60+ year old ears have a difficult time understanding the British accent. I will say we did not have any problem with the accent, the actors spoke clearly and distinctly. Also, there was not a lot of background music to interfere with the dialogue.",1204243200,7,439,4.5

2456630,5,B000CCD1SO,"This series does a delightful rendition of the books. The mysteries are interesting puzzles, the feeling of the time and people is authentic,and the people are warmly personable and polite. This is a really pleasant change from violent race-across-the-screen action. It is a time where people matter, puzzles can be unravelled, and we can respect the constabulary. Reassuring and interesting at the same time. Worth watching many times.",1177113600,24,436,5.426470588235294
