8255228,5,B0014D5PRK,"This awesome lesson with George Lynch is definitely worth your time if you want to become a super lead guitarist and shredder. In this video he will teach you some of his favorite licks and riffs that made him one of the greatest shredders of all time.  A lot of the licks are minor and diminished but sound really cool when added to a solo. It is recommended that you know some basics but this lesson will definitely add to your skills and give you a lot more licks, tricks and ideas and is well worth the time to check it out regardless of your experience or skill level.  Jesus is your answer and God bless you :)",1490572800,,616,4.211864406779661

8255230,5,B0014D5PRK,"George Lynch is wicked, filthy, lightning fast, and brilliant on the guitar.  Mozart was born to write music, Tom Hanks was born to act, and George Lynch was born to shred.  His solos are very complex and he stays ""busy"" throught every song.  Into the Fire, Heaven Sent, In My Dreams, THe Hunter, Kiss of Death, and Alone Again all show his amazing talent(s) as a musician.  Anyone who shares my passion for music, especially this era, this is a must buy and watch.  Guitar pleayers like this only come around once.  Today's music is a far cry from the epic sound of this era.",1376524800,3,576,4.438095238095238

8255232,1,B0014D5PRK,"What a ripoff lynch,if I wanted to hear you play i could have bought a cd for less money. A great guitar player,but he doesn't have the patience to try to teach,You can tell by the look on his face its practically killing him to even try to slow down so you can understand what he is doing. So if you are looking for instruction or note for note licks,or too actually learn anything,this is not the dvd you should buy",1292544000,3,417,4.160493827160494
8255233,5,B0014D5PRK,"I had this on VHS back in the day, and just recently gt it along with the Japanese release of ""George's Guitar Bible"". What's amazing to me is that his playing after 26 years still sounds as fresh immediate, and great. If this younger generation who are into Avenged Sevenfold, Dragonforce, etc., would simply pick these two discs up, they would see what influenced them.

This DVD is full of great licks, and George has enough foresight to realize that not everyone is as quick as him, so he slows it down for the beginner, gives you the meat and potatoes of what makes the lick work without bombarding you with theory, and then shows you how fast playing should be: No compromises, a WHOLE lot of attitude, and immediate. Shredding with a purpose.

George was the single most important influence in my playing, and when I get bored with what I am hearing, I always go back and listen to his work. Even when he plays a standard lick, he somehow makes it sound fresh.",1290729600,4,967,4.488636363636363
8255234,5,B0014D5PRK,"Excellent Instructional DVD.  George Lynch is still one of my all time main influences on the Guitar.  This DVD really nails his technique.  I've been blastin' it out since I received it,  and has been a tremendous inspiration to me.  Thanks ever so kindly.  : )
