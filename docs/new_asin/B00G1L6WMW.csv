6044398,5,B00G1L6WMW,"Great stuff, like a big PPV. This DVD shows why Wahoo McDaniels, Brusier Brody and others were such stars. I love the line-up and a little better than Vol 1 which was great!!! I like this series and can't wait for #3 !!!",1395792000,,220,4.1395348837209305

8620050,1,B00G1L6WMW,"This set is crap. The footage may be 30 or more years older but I've seen different sets with matches from that era & it looks a hell of a lot better then this. I was so disappointed with this set I cancelled my order for the first volume in the series. Overall, if you want a good quality DVD featuring wrestlers of the past then check of Wrestling Gold. It was a set released in the early 2000's & hosted plus commentated by Jim Cornette & Dave Meltzer. I highly recommend that set to old school wrestling fans. This set sucks. Avoid at all cost unless you like to watch a grainy picture.",1419811200,,590,4.184210526315789

8620053,4,B00G1L6WMW,"Great video for the true Wrestling fan.  I grew up watching these guys when I could.  Video quality is good, just keep in mind the era these were recorded and the equipment of the day.",1406592000,,184,4.228571428571429
8620054,3,B00G1L6WMW,"Great matches, great wrestlers. My main gripe is the DVD quality leaves a bit to be desired. I'm not talking about how it was shot (the footage is 30-35 years old) by the digitization is not meant for today's TVs and monitors. This disc will look better on smaller TVs as well as older tube versions. A shame because Uncle Vinnie isn't releasing this quality of packages. We can knock wwe all we want (I know I do) but at least their DVDs/BRs look far better than these.",1405728000,,470,4.3522727272727275
8620055,4,B00G1L6WMW,"Another enjoyable selection of matches from Southwest Championship Wrestling and Texas All Star Wrestling but overall video quality is disappointing.  Texas All Star is less than VHS quality in most cases while the Southwest is excellent but not transferred properly as there is pixillation at times.  The ""Did You Know"" features are still annyoing and take away from the in-ring action.
