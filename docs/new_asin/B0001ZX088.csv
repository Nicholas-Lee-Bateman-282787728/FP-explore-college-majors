2048841,5,B0001ZX088,"A few weeks ago I considered myself a lucky man. A big fan of director Stuart Gordon (of Re-Animator, and more recent Dagon fame.) I came across a UK DVD version of this movie. Not yet released in the States I get to tell you how good a movie this is.
For American (and these days also more and more overseas) audiences groomed on Hollywood dung like Van Helsing and Harry Potter this is going to be a hard movie. For underground and indie moviebuffs this is...well one helluva treat!
In short, the story is based on a novel by British writer Charlie Higson (most famous for writing tv series like the revamped Randall and Hopkirk) and follows a down on his luck house painter who sees himself being recruited as a hitman. Sounds improbable? Trust me,it all works out onscreen. What follows is a very violent, at times almost surrealistic movie. And like with his previous films, Gordon had me loving every minute of it (I even liked his Fortress).
There are some fine performances here, by the likes of George 'Norm' Wendt as utter scumbag Duke and the least known Baldwin brother as the main baddie. I also liked Aussie genre fave Vernon Wells (from Mad Max II and he played Bennet in Schwarzenegger's Commando) as a baddie who softens up against his captive. You'll be suprised about what fate Gordon has in store for him...but than again this isn't that Hollywood blockbuster, and I refuse to go into spoiler territory.
The revelation here however is Chris McKenna. As Sean Crawley he is a good solid actor with plenty of screen persona and wit. I loved him and hope he has a long career ahead of him. His line where Duke compares him to: ""James f....ing Bond"" and he just answers: 'No, Sean f....ing Crawley!' is a classic and had me gloating in my seat.
I can't rave about this movie enough. I recommend it to everybody who knows how to find it. Personally I can't help but compare it to a Tarantino flick. I saw this about the same time as everybody was hyping the video release of Kill Bill vol 1. This is so much more brutal and yes SUPERIOR than that(and by the way Gordon is so much better at portraying onscreen eroticism and perversities than Tarantino will ever be)!

2048914,3,B0001ZX088,"King of the Ants (2003) is a strange little thriller from The Asylum, that features some quirky elements and outbreaks of violence, but doesn't quite manage to pull things together in completely satisfying way, as a simple surveillance job turns into a murder for hire, and much more.

LA businessman Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin) hires Sean Crawley (Chris McKenna) a housepainter, to do a surveillance job.  Following accountant Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston) on his bike, Crawley observes Gatley meeting with a TV reporter, and showing her a file.  Matters escalate, when Crawly accepts Matthews' offer of cash, to kill Gatley.

The murder is quite brutal, and concludes with the accountant being crushed to death.  Crawley steals Gatley's file, which details Matthew's illegal operations, and passes it to a friend.  Matthews and three of his henchmen kidnap Crawley, and hold him prisoner at Matthews' house in the desert.  With the intent to cause brain damage, Sean is bashed in the head with a golf club.  This act is repeated, and although Crawley's condition deteriorates, he still refuses to reveal where the file is.

The plan to make Crawley an idiot is diabolical, but the execution by the kidnappers is very poor, and the film just becomes less credible, as with his friend arriving at the perfect moment, Crawley manages to escape, and also reclaim the file.  His luck keeps improving, as he is taken in at the shelter where Gatley's widow Susan (Kari Wuhrer) works, and after his severely battered head heals, he winds up moving into the home of the man he killed.  But Crawley is not done with killing yet.

The dialog is often weak, and the acting decent at best, but what saves the film are the action scenes which are executed in a very straightforward and simplistic manner.  The murder of Gatley is grim, messy, and feels brutally real.  The beatings with a golf club, and use of gore, are also effective.  The film's violent conclusion is remarkably efficient, and straight to the point, except for some philosophical musings by Crowley.

While the action elements, and even some dream sequences work well, the story doesn't put them together in a very credible way.  Sean should probably require surgery to repair his skull, but instead recovers quickly.  Matthews spends much time and expense dealing with Crawley, rather than just paying him off.  Susan, whose husband has just been murdered, deals daily with people who are homeless, yet she still takes in Sean, a stranger who actually has a place to live.

Although realism isn't a major factor, the bold violence and performances of Kari Wuhrer, Chris McKenna, George Wendt, and even Daniel Baldwin, adds enough make for an offbeat but interesting watch.",1343779200,,2732,4.975770925110132

2048917,5,B0001ZX088,"I stumbled upon ""King of the Ants"" while browsing a filmography of actor Daniel Baldwin. I was intrigued by the title and had no idea what to expect when I rented the movie from Amazon.com. The story centers around an amiable young drifter named Sean  Crawley (Chris McKenna), who is hired by shady construction contractor Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin) to ""spy"" on accountant Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston), and report on his activities. When Sean visits the accountant's home things go terribly wrong and he ends up killing Gatley. Matthews and his buddy ""Duke"" Wayne (George Wendt) reproach Sean for the murder and refuse to pay him. They viciously display their animosity by torturing Sean and repeatedly bashing him in the side of the head with a golf club.

Daniel Baldwin is a Twitter pal and distant cousin of mine. I know him as a charismatic, savvy, humorous dude who wouldn't harm a fly. It was something of a shock to see him portray loathsome brute Ray Matthews with such agility. In truth, the characters of Ray Matthews and Daniel Baldwin are polar opposites, a fact which led me to the realization that Daniel Baldwin is an exceptionally fine and vastly under-rated actor! Chris McKenna was equally as impressive in his role as Sean Crawley. By the end of the movie it was Sean who took out his vengeance on his tormenters.

If you're looking for a ""happily ever after"" ending, avoid this film like the plague. There are few redeeming players in the drama but the special effects and acting are superb. If you have the stomach to wade through all the violence and gore this flick is well worth viewing!",1320883200,3,1615,4.740213523131673
2048918,5,B0001ZX088,This movie is very hard to find. I found it here and for a great price. This movie shows the under dog can win,1280966400,,110,3.625
2048919,1,B0001ZX088,"I'll jump right to my thoughts of this movie, as this movie isn't worth much effort. This movie had a chance. THe plot could have been fairly interesting had each part been explored to its fullest. They weren't. Each tangent of the main characters story is hastily vaulted into the next without much explanation.

The plot? The story revolves around a dim-witted house painter that is manipulated into killing a municipal accountant that was researching the misdeeds of a local building company. McKenna plays the scruple-lacking dope whom is duped into this by promise of payment and, sought after 'excitement'. When he seeks payment, he is told to get out of town, but he is too stupid for that. He tries to extort payment based on principle (?) and pride. That leads to an explicit scene of he getting tortured. He escapes via the most gruesome means and winds up at shelter, where, by chance (ya, right), he is nursed back to health by the beautiful widow of the accountant he murdered. Of course, that leads to she taking him in as her project and eventual love, but, just as this plot twist is in somewhat novel and in interesting territory, she discovers his evidence of murder (left, stupidly, in the family house) and confronts him. OK, I get it - it's a tragedy, but how stupid can one guy be? Anyway, he is left with little but his desire to get even with the builder and torturers, which he does in disgusting fashion.

I had read some reviews by film critics and could not disagree more with the acclaim provided the acting of Chris McKenna and the rest of the cast, short of Kari Wuhrer (the widow)and George Wendt. She did an admirable job as someone vulnerable, yet giving. Wendt was very believable as a 'hammer' for the builder. All others were incredibly shallow, including McKenna. (Unless it was intended that he portray his character as the most stupid, aimless, and morally bankrupt fool on the planet.)

Anyway, the bottomline is - don't do this movie. If any facet of this sounds appealing to you, I can assure you it will be too brief to make the movie worth the viewing torture!",1259625600,,2105,4.638069705093834

2048933,3,B0001ZX088,"I liked this film for what it is. I'd watch it again, even. But overall it's a bit too strange what happens here. The story is extremly simple, a bit too simple, and gets a bit too bizarre halfway throught.

The good things about this film were the baddies. I still have no explanation why I liked them this much. Even when they're doing awful things to the hero, I sort of wanted them to be my friends... There's something extremly sympathetic and funny about them, maybe because they're still like kids, fooling around, drinking alcohol and act like grown-up kids, even when they begin bashing the hero's head to amnesie.

I don't know still what to think about this film. usually, baddies of this sort build up barrels of hate in the viewer, so that by the end it is like a therapy to watch them pay the bill. I don't know if it's a good or a bad thing that Mister Gordon made us like the hero, even after he's crossed the line of morality, and even like the baddies. They're beyond any morality, both, but very likeable.

SPOILERS AHEAD: The end isn't exactly thrilling, it's actually pretty easy to watch as the baddies don't have a chance and the hero stays hyper cool and distanced to the revenge. There's no fighting, no celebration of violence, he just waits for them to come, hits a hammer into each's belly and lets them enjoy the pain while burning another person. Then he burns the house and the movie is over. I confess: I was waiting for a really disturbingly violent showdown.

About halfway throught the movie, the hero can live in the house of his victim's wife. His death is only a few days in the past and she already lets a complete stranger with an obviously dangerous past live there. Dangerous, because his head is so awfully beaten up after his escape. Talking of which: he gets help from a friend, and regarding the extremly bad state the hero is in, it's just laughable to watch the friend's reaction on a bad joke from the hero, so he throws him out of the car and leaves him on his own, with a head that looks like the one from ""THE ELEPHANT MAN"".

I have watched many disturbing movies, ""I Spit on your Grave"", ""Last House on the Left"", ""The Night Porter"", etc. but those movies pale in comparison to this. The beating scenes are gritty and completey realistic. To be honest I could not watch the whole sequence. It is the torture more than the violence that got to me. The psychological torture of anticipating the beatings through the eyes of the victim (at that moment). The Baldwin brother who was on the TV show Homocide plays a villain

in this movie and is very convincing as a total piece of garbage. The torture is really bad because it does not occur all at once and is spread out over time so the main character and the viewer have time to recover only to go through it again and again and again. Yikes!!!! If ever a movie should be NC-17 this is it. Tons of blood and gore cant compare to realistic torture sequences.

2048936,4,B0001ZX088,"I came into Stuart Gordon's ""King of the Ants"" expecting some weird blend of science fiction and horror. Just look at the title. Doesn't that scream sci-fi/horror? Considering Gordon's other features almost always reside deep in the well of blood soaked cinema, one could safely assume this picture would cover familiar ground. Here's a guy who has made films like ""Re-Animator,"" ""Castle Freak,"" a remake of ""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" the H.P. Lovecraft adaptations ""Dagon"" and ""From Beyond,"" and the Christopher Lambert sci-fi vehicle ""Fortress."" I think it's safe to assume ""King of the Ants"" should fall within these parameters, right?  Boy, was I wrong! The title ""King of the Ants"" couldn't be more misleading in describing the themes this movie actually covers. There is no king, as far as I can tell. There are no ants, although they would be quite difficult to see unless they were mutant ants that stood fifty feet tall. Instead, Gordon gives us a film adapted from a book by Charlie Higson, a film that deals with a bad deal gone wrong and the subsequent bloody revenge wreaked upon the principals by an unassuming housepainter who was literally in the wrong place at the wrong time. Well, at least Gordon's penchant for blood soaked cinema remains firm with this project.

Sean Crawley (Chris McKenna) is your average young guy just trying to get by as a housepainter when opportunity comes knocking one day in the form of the portly Duke (George Wendt). The two men strike up a friendly rapport while working on a house, and Duke promptly invites his new friend to meet a most important individual. This person is a powerful construction contractor named Ray Mathews (Daniel Baldwin), a beefy thug with a love of golf and a hatred for a certain accountant down at city hall called Eric Gatley (Ron Livingstone). Mathews offers our boy Sean a specific sum of money if he'll simply follow Gatley around town and report back on his movements. It seems that Ray's involved in several shady schemes, schemes meaning kickbacks on projects, and Eric is nosing around in the hope of saving the city some money by sending Mathews to the slammer. Crawley, always on the lookout for a few extra bucks, sees no harm in tailing a suburbanite. He heads over to Gatley's home to start his mission, and can't help but notice that the accountant has an incredibly gorgeous wife. Sean spends some time doing the job and reports back to Mathews.

Then something ominous happens. Ray and Sean have a heart to heart while Mathews liberally gulps firewater. The contractor seems to indicate that something ""bad"" should happen to Eric Gatley, and that if something ""bad"" happens, a big payoff might be in the cards for whoever carries out the dirty deed. At least this is how Crawley interprets the conversation. The next day he follows Gatley home and murders the guy in a particularly brutal, bloody manner. Then he turns up seeking payment from Mathews, but Ray expresses anger at what happened. He claims that the authorities are all over him because they think he had Gatley bumped off. Not only does he refuse to hand over the cash, he tells Crawley to get lost. Sean's not the sort of chap to take no for an answer, and his persistent efforts to get what's owed him results in a kidnapping and a series of extraordinarily brutal tortures inflicted upon him by Mathews, Duke, and a few other stooges. Much to their everlasting detriment, Ray and company fail to kill their former flunky. Sean escapes and, with the help of the most unlikeliest of allies, returns to full health with the goal of seeking revenge on his tormentors. The end.

I left a bunch of particulars out in order not to spoil the film, but ""King of the Ants"" is really as simple as the above summary. Wronged man seeks revenge. That's it in a nutshell. In the hands of the capable Stuart Gordon, however, the movie manages to entertain thanks to a number of exploitative factors. First is the presence of Kari Wuhrer, the brunette B movie actress who plays Eric Gatley's wife Susan here. Through the most unusual of circumstances, she ends up offering help to her husband's murderer. Her role also requires her to do some acrobatics in her birthday suit that this viewer greatly appreciated. Second, Gordon doesn't shy away from violence. We've got a golf club repeatedly hitting a head, pools of blood, a refrigerator used as a murder weapon, and a gory showdown that results in all sorts of ghastly indecencies. ""King of the Ants"" contains more than enough bloodshed to satiate the avid gorehound. Third, and finally, Gordon isn't above throwing in a few scenes of weirdness just to keep the audience off balance. Check out that hallucination Crawley experiences during his kidnapping. What the heck was that thing all about? Who knows, but it was entertaining and appropriately kooky.

""King of the Ants"" is sort of in a category all by itself. It doesn't really fit into the field of horror, and it's not entirely at home in the standard revenge flick genre, either. If you like horror and you like revenge shoot 'em ups, however, you'll probably enjoy Gordon's movie. I know I did; I would definitely watch this one again. As for the DVD version of the film, extras abound. We get a trailer, a commentary track with Gordon, Wendt, and McKenna, and a lengthy behind the scenes feature containing interviews with many of the principal players. This short documentary is interesting in a number of ways, such as learning that it was George Wendt who played a big role in bringing this movie to fruition. Give ""King of the Ants"" a go if you get a chance. It's worth watching.",1120953600,,5642,4.753061224489796

2048941,4,B0001ZX088,"King of the Ants (Stuart Gordon, 2003)

Stuart Gordon is, of course, best-known for his basement-budget adaptations of Lovecraft, but he's never confined himself solely to the horror film; witness the sci-fi action flick Fortress, or his work in the kids'-film genre (which, while not extensive, does comprise a surprising amount of his production time). Thus, King of the Ants is not as much of a surprise as it would first seem. Unlike most of his previous forays into non-horror, though, King of the Ants delivers in spades.

Sean Crawley (Chris McKenna, previously seen in the TV series Opposite Sex) is a rootless guy who's willing to do just about anything to make a buck. While painting a house one day, he meets an electrician named Duke (Cheers' George Wendt). Duke works for a guy named Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin). Matthews needs a guy watched. Crawley has a dumb fantasy about being a private eye. Everyone's happy, until Matthews reveals to Crawley while drunk one night that the guy he's having followed he actually wants dead. From there, things get weird.

Based on a novel by Charles Higson, King of the Ants is in most respects your standard action-revenge fare. (Had it gotten wide release, its timing would have been perfect; Blake Crouch's book Desert Places came out around the same time, and the two have a good deal in common.) Where it rises above is in its characters. Much has been made of Sean's move from being a basically likable drifter into being a basically likable killer, and it probably says more about me than about the movie that I didn't see it as being all that much a stretch (thus, my being impressed comes from different areas); if you're the kind of person who thinks such a transformation would be something to see, by all means, rent this. More surprising, to me, was the detail to be found in even the minor characters. One expects development from Ray and Duke, but in most action flicks, the other henchmen who form Ray's band of criminals would just be there as window dressing. Not so here; the other two guys on the team (capably played by Vernon Wells, the villain in Schwarzenegger vehicle Commando, and Lionel Mark Smith, recently seen in State and Main, Magnolia, and Life Among the Cannibals) are fully-fleshed minor players. One assumes they were even more fleshed out in the novel, but that the adaptation didn't jettison their characters altogether is one of the things that makes this such a fine film.

Definitely worth seeing. Not for the weak of stomach by any means, but a fine thrill-ride. *** ",1101686400,6,2562,4.774266365688487
2048962,4,B0001ZX088,"Here's a question: why is there so much inequality and injustice in the world?

Let's frame that another way: why is it that some men get exactly what they want right down to their death in a $50 million Bel-Air castle, while others slave miserably to the extremely bitter end, desperately poor and unhappy in the very clutch of Death, cursing God, society, and destiny?

As Stuart Gordon's unlikely protagonist Sean Crawley (Chris McKenna) in the gut-bustingly brutal beating-disguised-as-movie ""King of the Ants"" might say: ""Why does there have to be a reason?""

""King of the Ants"" is Gordon's most philosophical movie: ""King"" has a lot on its mind, no pun intended---and working against type, the movie is brutally straightforward. That makes ""King of the Ants"" seem strange and foreign and a little unsettling to Gordon regulars. After all, whether he's conjuring up Lovecraft (""The Beyond"", ""Re-Animator"", ""Dagon"") or cobbling together a warning on the perils of buying real estate sight-unseen (""Castle Freak""), Gordon is a typically baroque director: a Gordon set is a busy set, with lots of devils and lots of details.

Not so here: ""King of the Ants"" takes that approach, turns it on its head, and plants the sucker face-first into the middle of seamy, steamy Los Angeles. This flick gets straight down to business, plopping its dweeby loser protagonist Sean Crawley down with seemingly affable, amiable fellow housepainter Duke (George Wendt, of whom we will say more later). Crawley is aimless, directionless, pathetic, and eager to please (and make some money on the side): The Duke has an idea and thinks Crawley is the perfect man for the job.

It's a simple plan: follow some schlubbo bureaucraft from City Hall around, keep an eye on him, report his activities back to The Duke. Crawley tries to come across as a shrewd negotiator and a wise-guy with The Duke: I felt embarrassed for him as he quickly and inexorably wilted. For fun, keep an eye on Wendt's facial expressions in this first 'negotiation'.

So naturally, Crawley agrees to the ""job"", and lamely trails his target on his bicycle, keeping an eye on his mark and---increasingly---on the man's wife (Carlie Westerman). One thing leads to another, and as Yeats said ""things fall apart...the center cannot hold"": Gears are set in motion, and the rest of ""King of the Ants"" ratchets like a Devil's Hellride, in which Crawley is subsequently and ruthlessly introduced to greed, lust, murder, betrayal, the oilly Ray Mathews (Daniel Baldwin), Mathews's oillier henchmen, and the amazingly liberating properties of a Number 3-Wood golf club applied early and often, gruesome torture, and a little exposure and starvation thrown in for good measure.

Gordon and his faithful cinematographer Mac Ahlberg (who worked with Gordon on ""Robotjox"" and ""Re-Animator"") have managed to cook up a nasty little piece of work: I don't know what it is, but I like it. It's spare. It's edgy. It feels raw, ruthless, hardcore; simple, clean and lethal. Turn off your expectations of what a Gordon film ""should"" feel like and just let it all sink it, drink it all up: see if you don't think ""King of the Ants"" feels like a freshman effort by a radical rebel filmmaker---and I mean that in the best possible way.

That's really all you need to know about ""King of the Ants"" before digging in. That, and the fact that most of the acting is astonishing. Chris McKenna (""Crawley""), an unknown, wears the role like a glove and owns this film: it's amazing to see the wild flare and riptide of emotions over his face. And sure, go into this movie expecting the warm fat cuddliness of Norm from ""Cheers"": Wendt proves that fat men need not be jolly. He's terrifying and totally plausible. Baldwin is slimy, repulsive, and perfectly tailored to his role: I work with guys like him every day. Carlie Westerman is the lone exception: I didn't buy her role and her willingness to take in a possibly deranged drifter, but Westerman's role is just to get things from point A to point B.

Now, for those of you who have seen the movie, I want to back up what I said earlier about ""King"" being Gordon at his most philosophical. Some have described ""King of the Ants"" as being a straightforward 'revenge' story: I agree that it's straightforward, but I don't think it has much to do with revenge. I think it's more of a ""personal liberation"" movie, or maybe an ""Ideas have Consequences"" movie.

For the last 40 years we've worked overtime in American society to dethrone our most common, basic assumptions, chief of which is the idea of God, universal Truth, punishment for Evil. I bet if you took an honest poll, about 85% of American schoolkids have as much faith in God as they do in Santa Claus. Maybe that's cynicism talking, but I've got a pretty good pulse on popular culture, and frankly I don't think so.

Where does that leave us? Watch closely what happens when the Duke leads Crawley into the reptile house, and listen to what is said---and then think about this: when we dethrone the Divine, when we eliminate objective Truth in the universe, what else is left but brutal survival? If there is no Good or Evil, no punishment beyond this world, then I should take what I can grab---right? What else is left but doing whatever you want to do? What other threat is there but the threat of death---and if you can master the fear of dying, what limitations do you have? And isn't that truly what is meant by ""Freedom""?

The horror of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" was that its scientist started with a monster and worked to create a Man. The horror of ""King of the Ants"" is that its ""scientists"" start with a Man and work backwards.",1100822400,3,5677,4.781632653061225

2048964,2,B0001ZX088,"I was a little misled by the synopsis on the back of the cover and not really familiar with Stuart Gordon's work. I usually like unpopular ""different"" types of movies, the kind the mainstream audience wouldn't think to watch, but this was definitely not my type of movie. It started off good and had some good familiar actors like George Wendt ""Norm"" from ""Cheers"" and Daniel Baldwin, as interesting characters along with some good newcomers. Some of the scenes were slow moving and kinda boring but overall I was getting into the movie.....until the beating and hallucination scene's. I was so disturbed by the end of that sequence that I had to turn off the movie and couldn't watch any more. Usually I'll watch anything, but those images just stay with you and won't leave. VERY INTENSE. I guess the bottom line is if your not familiar with Stuart Gordon's work, you'll probably be in for a surprise!",1094688000,2,903,4.7215189873417724
2048965,4,B0001ZX088,"This is one of those movies that makes you wonder what to think. There were definitely elements of surprise, and it wasn't what I expected from reading the review on the back of the DVD case.  One of the most interesting aspects was the twisted development of the main character throughout the course of the movie.  He starts out appearing to be an ""average joe,"" but by the time the movie is nearly over he has become borderline psychotic.  While watching the movie you might feel somewhat sorry for his victims, yet you feel sorry for him at the same time due to his circumstances.

The acting wasn't too bad, although it was surprising to see ""Norm"" from ""Cheers"" in the movie.  The special effects were pretty good, especially when the main character was hallucinating.  There were a few times when I pretty much knew what was going to happen in certain scenes, but there were more times when I was completely surprised by what I saw.  The only thing I thought that could have been improved was the slowness of some scenes where there was no action.  I just fast forwarded through those scenes.

If you're looking for a movie that's a little different from any other movie you've seen, this movie is probably a safe bet.  I've been a horror buff for many years, and I can't think of any other horror/suspense movie I've seen that resembles this one.",1094256000,,1353,4.576763485477178
2048966,3,B0001ZX088,"When I saw Stuart Gordon, the man responsible for films like Re-Animator (1985), From Beyond (1986), among other films, was coming out with a new movie called King of the Ants (2003), I was excited, as I think within the realm of horror movies, he's always managed to certainly bring a level of creativity and present disturbing imagery that seemed to be missing from many of the films in the genre.  I had no idea what to expect from King of the Ants, but I did have fun with the film.  Was it his best?  Not in my opinion, but even a mediocre Stuart Gordon film is better than a lot of the horror junk we saddled with by the major studios.

The film stars an actor named Chris McKenna as Sean Crawley, a drifter type currently employed in painting peoples houses.  During one of his jobs, he meets Duke, played by George Wendt (Norm!), and said meeting changes his life as Duke introduces him to his boss, a somewhat shady character named Ray Matthews, played by one of the lesser known Baldwin brothers, Daniel, I think...anyway, Matthews owns a construction company, and is trying to land a particularly lucrative city contract, except an accountant in city hall named Gatley, played by Ron Livingston (the actor who played the main character in the 1999 film Office Space), seems to have evidence that may jeopardize Matthew's chances, so he enlists Sean to follow this accountant around, and collect information.  As Sean follows Gatley around, documenting his movements, he gets taken by Gatley's wife, Susan, played by Kari Wurher (if you watched MTV in the late 80's, you'll know who this is).  Sean reports back to Matthews, and things seem to be going well, but then after a late night meeting with a drunken Matthews, Sean is offered a chance to make a lot of money, at least more than he's ever seen.  Only one catch, Sean must kill Gatley.  After the dirty deed is done, Matthews reneges on the deal, claiming he Sean shouldn't have taken him seriously as he was drunk, and has only brought more heat down on him, and begins to put pressure on Sean to leave town, as Sean is the only link between Matthews and the recently murdered Gatley.  Well, Sean, won't leave without his money, and begins to squeeze Matthews, which is the wrong move, as Matthews and his henchmen decide to take Sean to a secluded location and beat him upside his head over the course of many days, so that he won't even know his own name, much less anything about else.  Sean gets the beating, for sure...but manages to escape...and eventually bring all his pain and torture back to his tormentors, one way or the other.

So what did I think of the movie?  Well, it was certainly more serious than the films I mentioned at the beginning.  Also, while it didn't contain the level of visceral gore of some of Gordon's other films, it did have enough to cause the casual viewer a great deal of wincing.  The brutality of the beatings Sean endures, a daily whack with a golf club to the head (a 3-wood, I believe), and the ensuing physical deformation made me a bit queasy.  And then there was the nightmarish hallucinations Sean suffered during his torture, which was pure Gordon on the level of a Re-Animator...I won't spoil it, but it will stick with you long after the movie's finished (think of the transformed Chet character from the movie Weird Science, but much worse).  I liked the overall concept, but I thought some of the plot elements unnecessary and even awkward.  The whole bit about Susan, who works at a mission that Sean ends up at and spends a couple months recovering, and her eventually taking him into her home, just completely farcical.  Sure, people don't always have the best judgment, but to take an indigent drifter home with you to stay with you and your young daughter shortly after the brutal death of your husband seems like the very worst of ideas.  It was obvious that it was set up to help further along the plot, but it was just so unbelievable.  I think Wurher's character was meant to sort of see Sean as some kind of lost puppy dog type, harmless and trustworthy, but it was just very difficult to swallow.  The story did have some other fairly glaring plot holes, but it moved along pretty well, but was pretty predictable.  Some of the performances seemed odd and disjointed, but the more brutal scenes overshadowed a lot of the weak elements.  Look for the character of Beckett, played by Vernon Wells.  It took me awhile to recognize him, but I finally realized he was the same person who played the biker Wez in The Road Warrior (1981).  This isn't a wholly slick production, having a somewhat gritty feel and texture, but I thought that played nicely against the main character.  Also, time has not been a friend to George Wendt.  And if you want to see Kari Wurher all nekkid, then this is your film.  She bares a lot, almost to the point of being gratuitous, but hey, I can't really complain.  Overall, after watching the film, I couldn't help feel like a lot of opportunities were missed, as the movie seemed to get bogged down a bit in the middle, but the ending does make up for a lot.  As with most Gordon movies, if you have a weak stomach or delicate sensibilities, you may want to pass this one up.

Presented here is a good looking wide screen print along with a few special features, including a 15-minute featurette, commentary by Stuart Gordon and Chris McKenna, and an original theatrical trailer.  I guess if I learned anything from this movie it's that that George Wendt sure sweats a lot...

2048967,2,B0001ZX088,"This film is the cinematic equivalent of the child who stands at the side of the pool and shouts ""Mom, look at me! Watch this! Mom! Mom!"" and then executes a non-descript cannonball.

The production team spent a lot of time thinking up sound effects for violence. Heads are chopped off, whacked with golf clubs, and generally treated poorly. Meanwhile we are watching a so-so story with so-so performances (other than the Baldwin brother, who is nice and creepy). There is absolutely nothing done cinematically to produce tension - all the shots are standard medium shots, the lighting is uniform throughout, and the camera seems to have been frozen in place during the entire film. Booooring.

How many times must we see, as a final shot, the protagonist walking away in slow motion while all behind him is devoured by flame? One more time, at least. All in all, a film meant to impress the kids. -Mykal Banta",1092873600,3,910,4.753164556962025

The way it is written and directed is superb, they make you feel different emotions for the character throughout: you like him at the beginning, not so much when he kills the guy, pity him when hes being beaten, then almost think hes just another bad guy by the end. I love it. THe nightmare scenes are rather disturbing, the switching of male and female anatomy in one disgusted me beyond belief, and the one where the monster ate its own, you know, my friend almost threw up on himself he was so disgusted. The actor who played crowley was phenomonal, I'm no industry expert but this guy should have a future.

2048970,4,B0001ZX088,"This is more like a drama that becomes a horror film because of the horrific events that follow.  The film so disturbed major studios that they refused to produce it (source: the Featurrette on the DVD).  I really liked it but it was disturbing.  The main character is a likeable twentysomething man who takes odd jobs where he can.  Eventually he's offered and accepts a shady job.  And... Just when we've grown to like guy, he proceeds to commit a despicable act and then gets double-crossed for it.  How he gets double-crossed and what is done after makes the intense meat of this unique film.  All the while we are rooting for the main character as criminal as he is-- which is part of what makes King of the Ants so disturbing.  The film is so  titled because the main character is referred to, at one point, as an ""ant""-- ""insignificant"".  But he begins to regard himself as the ""King of the Ants"".  What a transformation.  Not for the faint of heart.
