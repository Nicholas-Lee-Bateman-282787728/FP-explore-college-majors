The coaches aspire to learn the language a bit, all the players are only children.  The players do not like Italian noodles as they prefer their own style so they go to McDonalds.

They drive through Las Vegas on the way to Hursts' college where they get beat down, Hurst eventually leaves for a job with the Red Sox.

8300114,4,B001F0IPL0,"This documentary covers the four years of preparation of the Chinese national baseball team ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Although baseball had been well-known in China, it died out during the Mao era.

According to the manager of the Chinese team, former US big-leaguer Jim Lefebvre, this wasn't due to any ideological problem with baseball -- just a lack of funding and budgets to keep baseball going in the 1960s and 70s. So China had an earlier baseball culture that had practically died out, and the Chinese turned to MLB in the US for help. MLB sent Lefebve and pitching coach Bruce Hurst, who was later replaced by Steve Ontiveros.

The movie compresses four years into a single hour-long documentary, so there isn't a great level of detail, but it does show clips from a few important games. Against Cuba in Italy three years before the Olympics, where China was absolutely demolished. But there was a bright spot during the same games in Italy, when China actually defeated Taiwan -- which has a pretty good baseball culture.

Two and a half years before the Olympics, China played in an Asian series in Tokyo, and got creamed by Japan. Lefebvre is overheard telling an umpire that the team would be on a ""low A"" level in the US -- meaning class A in the minor leagues.

There are other major losses, but still a tone of optimism is maintained. There seems to be acceptance of the fact that China has a lot of catching up to do in developing a baseball culture.

The weakest part of the film is that it ends two months before the Olympics start, so there is a feeling that you don't get the payoff of finding out the end of the story. This is actually a pretty important weakness. If it had covered the games I probably would have given it five stars.

If you like stories of baseball in different cultures, you'll like this movie. I would also recommend it to anyone with a China interest.

But the basic theme is the same -- East meets West, on the baseball field and off, and tries to take what it can use to help its own game.",1255132800,2,2795,5.143171806167401
