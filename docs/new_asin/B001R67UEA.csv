3773701,5,B001R67UEA,TV western series that launched McQueen's movie stardom holds up well even after 50 years.  Guest stars among the best on TV at the time and the story lines are varied enough to keep your interest and different enough from competing series to stand out.  The quality of the DVDs (audio and video) is very good and the only disappointment is the cheaply packaged container (paper sleeves for the DVDs held in a plastic box between four clips - awkward access for the number of DVDs).,1385424000,36,482,4.593023255813954

3773713,5,B001R67UEA,"I bought WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE on a whim. I've always been a fan of Steve McQueen (who the hell isn't?), and since I'm fond of Westerns, especially older Westerns, I thought I'd take a chance and purchase this entire series of nearly 100 episodes even though I'd never seen so much as a single one. Sometimes risks pay off, and this one did. WANTED is some of the most fun I've had watching television in the past few years. It's an excellent, action-packed series that rightfully establishes McQueen as a star and still provides plenty of bang for the buck.

WANTED, shot between 1958 - 1961, is the story of Josh Randall, a former Confederate soldier turned Western bounty hunter. Traveling alone, Randall wanders from one godforsaken hellhole frontier town to another, tracking down wanted criminals and bringing them in (dead or alive) for the often considerable reward money. A tough and ruthless man (""I'd just as soon kill ya as look at ya,"" is one of his trademark lines) who packs a ""Mare's Leg"" (a cut-down, sawed-off lever action rifle in a hip holster) instead of a pistol, Randall nevertheless possesses a code of honor, considerable Old West charm (taking his hat off when addressing the ladies, etc.), and isn't above the occasional Quixotic quest to help a pretty lady or an old friend in need. Hell, he'll even risk his life for one of the men he's caught if he decides the fella (or occasionally, the lass) can't get a fair trial or is being hounded by vigilantes. At one point, in Season Two, he even picks up a partner, Jason Nichols (Wright King), and while the partnership doesn't last long, it does provide some fireworks.

The format of WANTED was interesting: the episodes were a tight 30 minutes in length, which meant that there is very little fat on the scripts. Because of this, very few of the stories seem to drag, and for the most part they manage to leave the viewer feeling as if he'd watched a full hour's worth of action and intrigue. There are occasional clunkers, sure, but for the most part the quality is surprisingly good for a show that cranked out about 30 episodes a season. Of course, one of the great pleasures of watching television and film from this era is seeing so many actors who later became famous -- Michael Landon, James Coburn, Martin Landau, Lee van Cleef, DeForest Kelly, Mary Tyler Moore, etc. -- while they were still young unknowns. And the half-hour format proved surprisingly flexible, with some stories highly dramatic, others pure action, some romantically charged or tragic, and quite a few downright funny. Of course, being shot in the late 50s-early-60s, the sensibilities are different than today. There are a couple of episodes where Josh does things that are kind of hard for me to stomach, but for the most part he's the sort of honorable-yet-flawed hero that can also get cold-cocked in a fistfight, played for a fool by a treacherous gal, or wiped out in a poker game.

To sum up, I'd say that if you like Westerns, especially the older-school sort of Western with plenty of gunplay, trail dust and nickel whiskey, this series is for you. If you're a fan of Steve McQueen and want to see how he developed the acting style that led to him being crowned as ""The King of Cool,"" you'll also enjoy this. So get on your horse and ride.",1516665600,2,3304,4.644444444444445

3773726,4,B001R67UEA,This is by far one of the best shows ever aired. However this new lesser priced complete series set is not of the same quality as the individual season sets also sold here at Amazon. I made the mistake of purchasing this set when I already owned seasons 1 and 2. I put them up against each other and discovered that those sets have a much clearer picture. Unfortunately Season 3 is very high priced which makes it difficult to get the complete series when you buy it the other way unless you purchase a used Season 3 set.,1503446400,,521,4.2727272727272725

It had incredible story lines that were well thought out and many twist endings. Season two is pretty good too although the stories got a bit weaker and more predictable. McQueen's acting is top notch in the first two seasons. By season three the show is a bit tired and corny. The music is a bit cartoonish in season three and even McQueen looks like he is hating being on set. In summary, it's worth the money even just for the first two seasons. Season three is enjoyable but it is a different animal than the first two.",1485129600,,631,4.310924369747899

While McQ was considered the king of cool,I think he was rude and unnecessarily threatened the older man once they arrived at Fort Apache. That's a huge minus in my book! The Easterner was a stranger in a strange land,and had to depend on a moody so-and-so to survive. Plenty of fights,but McQ is someone I can only take in small portions.

And it's charming - and some episodes are excellent (""Bounty on Josh"" comes to mind) and with the exception of a few towards the series' end, the episodes are satisfactorily good, entertaining, and all of them well-acted. (Love Steve McQueen's horsemanship - and gunplay! - as far as I know, both newly acquired for this show.) However, I read somewhere, sadly can't remember where, that the series actually originally had more than the 94 episodes shown, 114 or 117 or so? Can anyone enlighten me on that?
In any case, I am VERY happy that I could thanks to you enjoy at least this large sample.

It arrived a little later than I would have expected it to, as I ordered it on Sat. and to show off the ""Amazon Prime"" I had it delivered to a friend's house...well, there goes the 2 day thing, it's Wednesday.

I guess 4 episodes have been watched and of course they are a bit grainy and such.  We are so used to our HD power these days that these older movies just don't have that quality.  But, coming from a Western fan, they are ""fabulous"".  So, happy to please.  Oh boy, I'm being asked to order more things. Some people just don't understand the internet and how to use it properly.  I think they should give classes to the elderly, so I'm not stuck ordering.  lol.

I personally am not a Western movie fan, but hey, if a friend wants something I will help them out the best I can..perhaps blocking from the internet is in order!  Blahaha.

Unlike most movie stars that started in TV, you can see the same ""edge"" and ""cool"" in this series as America later witnessed in McQueen classics Bullet and The Magnificent Seven.

3773893,3,B001R67UEA,"I am thrilled to have all three seasons at a killer price.  But I started watching these on Netfix discs.  They only had season one so I bought this complete set.  The rental discs were put out by Newline and were only 4 to 6 episodes per disc with some extras.  But the Mill Creek set here has twice as many episodes per disc.  This lowers the quality of the images.  I saw the difference right off.  This set just isn't nearly as sharp and detailed as the Newline discs from NF.  The tighter cropping...  and the image jumping around on the Mill Creek discs was also not present on the Newline discs from NF.

I see there is a Newline set here on Amazon but the first season is a 4 disc set like the Mill Creek.  Not 8 discs like the Newline set I checked out from NF.  I don't know if the 8 disc per season set even exits anymore...  or if it was ever available in seasons 2 or 3.

Too bad they decided to cheapen the product to save $2 on dvds.  I think we'd all be happy to pay the difference.  Took off two starts for the quality of the video.  Still better than many series from this era.  But I was spoiled with the original Newline series I first watched.

As a collector of films and TV shows for over 30 years I have never seen such a shoddy way of presenting and protecting the contents within this case. Inside all the DVD discs are slipped into CD paper sleeves that cost maybe .10 cents and they stack into an internal plastic box that is barely large enough to hold all the discs without cramming them into it.  To watch a single episode you must first remove all the paper sleeved discs and then sort through them to find what you want then cram them back into the small internal box.  (the sleeves provide the friction needed to hold them into place)  A few times doing this and the sleeves will fall apart, and without the sleeves the discs will just rattle around that box, causing untold damage.  For this reason alone I rated it 3 stars.  If you order this box set be sure to order one or two cases that will hold mult-discs.(12 discs total)

As for the discs themselves, they are wonderful, crisp and clear for a fantastic, truly classic TV series and they receive a 5 star rating!. I gladly would have paid a few dollars more though for better packaging.",1399507200,29,1161,4.372093023255814

3773917,5,B001R67UEA,"The problem is in the DVD case.  The studio, Mill Creek Entertainment, had decided to get the cheapest DVD case possible and the most awkward packaging to cut costs.  In the centre of the case, is a square, plastic holding bay.  In this there are 12 discs, and each disc is housed in a cheap, paper/Cellophane sleeve.  These are typically like the paper sleeves containing a CD of programs/drivers that come with a modem, video card, motherboard, et cetera.  A disc in these paper sleeves is difficult to remove (without getting fingerprints all over the bottom surface of the disc) and gets caught on the edges of the paper.  They are fiddly to put back also.  The solution to this is to buy a typical, stock-standard, 12 - disc storage case with a 1   (39 mm) spine and transfer all the discs.  I have done this, and the front/back cover artwork page fits well.

The reason I have given it five stars is the low cost of the box set of the entire series plus the quality of the video.  About nine years ago, when another studio started distributing this series, just one season cost more this box set.  With these Mill Creek discs, the telecine transfer from the film stock is superb and far superior than those that were produced nine years ago.  The video shows deep blacks and bright whites and the contrast is very good with just the right amount of grey scale.  Indoor and night scenes are not too dark and have just the right amount of lighting.  Outdoor day scenes also have the right amount of lighting and the resolution on some footage is remarkable.

As a bonus in this box set, are Five Featurettes - The Art of the Replica, The Mare's Leg, Reckless, The Women of Wanted: Dead or Alive, Winchester: A Weapon of Legend.  Also included are selected Colorized Episodes - The Martin Poster, The Favor, Six-Up to Bannach, Reunion for Revenge.  The last one they throw in has nothing to do with Wanted: Dead or Alive.  It is the 1959 feature length film - The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.",1396742400,42,1996,4.506963788300836

I was at a friend's house talking and couldn't really pay attention, but I remember thinking, ""Is that Steve McQueen?""  Sure enough, it was.  I wound up finding the entire series on YouTube and watched a few episodes.  I was immediately hooked.  Normally, I'm not a fan of old Western TV shows (Bonanza is the only other classic TV Western I'll watch, just the first few seasons), but Josh Randall quickly won me over.  I've even gotten into Rawhide and The Rifleman (I don't like Chuck Connors)-- shows that were popular when my parents were toddlers, shows that put TV Westerns from my childhood and college years (The Young Riders, the Adventures of Briscoe County, Jr, the Magnificent Seven) to shame.",1395360000,,775,4.661764705882353

3773923,5,B001R67UEA,"I had vaguely known about this show because I had seen replicas of the famous ""Mare's Leg"" McQueen used in the show, but I had never actually seen an episode (forgivable I hope since I was born in 1979.)  On saw this here on Amazon one day, and on impulse I bought it to watch while I was on the treadmill exercising.  I have always liked Steve McQueen as an actor, own a couple of his movies and see several others, so I figured this would fit the bill since I have been in an ""Old West"" kind of mood buying up classic western movies to watch.  Boy was I surprised at what a gem this show turned out to be.  I'll break this review up into sections about the show itself, and then the packaging format and reproduction quality.

The show itself:

So how does the show rate.  Well, judging by my 5 star review you can guess how I feel.  This show came early in Steve McQueens acting career, yet you probably would never have guessed.  The seriousness and professionalism he brought to such great roles in movies like The Sand Pebbles and The Great Escape are equally evident in this show.  The dialogue doesn't feel forced, McQueen acts, speaks and moves as if really Josh Randall, bounty hunter.  The support cast can vary in some cases from well done, to stereotypical of the day (for example, in one episode McQueen captures an ""Apache"" and forces him to take him to water...the ""Apache"" has rather light colored eyes and the credits indicate a rather Germanic last name), but it is made up for with some classic greats like Alan Hale Jr. (the Skipper from Gilligan's Island) giving great performances.  Now, I won't fool you into believing that the plot lines and acting are at the cinema level of such great movies as Sergio Leone's ""Man with no name"" trilogy, Unforgiven or Open Range.  But how could a 24 minute long (not including credits), black and white TV series from  the late 50's approach the level of a 3 hour Hollywood movie with multi-million dollar budgets?  No, it isn't Oscar level, but the episodes still give you good plots and writing for the 24 minutes.  Some can be formulaic (like when McQueen plays the humble good guy and gives over his bounty money to the down-and-out person of said given episode.)  But for the most part you get hit with catchy situations that don't necessarily seem as if they came out of a Louis L'amour novel.  As long as you can accept the limitations that such a short TV show from that time period had to work with then you will be quite satisfied all around with what this show offers you.

Packaging and video transfer reproduction:

There are 12 DVD's, each in it's own paper sleeve, and held inside a DVD case that is roughly the width of 2 1/2 or 3 regular sized DVD cases.  Some would see this as a minor negative.  Frankly it does not bother me since I have started converting my CD and DVD collection into jewel case/DVD case-less packaging.  Now, as soon as I get a DVD or CD in I pull out the disc, all the papers/artwork that come with it, stick the disc in a Case Logic disc case and put the papers/artwork in a special box dedicated to it.  This way I can pick up a case (usually divided into categories like ""TV shows"", ""War movies"", ""Westerns"", etc.) and have instant access to a whole collection.  But if you still use CD DVD cases be aware the packaging is not quite as good as many other multi-disc DVD cases.

The reproduction to digital of the original show, for the most part is very good.  You will get the occasional audio oddity, like low volume or the odd ""click"" or ""pop"".  I have not watched all the episodes yet, but of those I have watched the video is just fine.  So the only issue I have found so far have been audio only.

The moral of the story:

For under $20 you get 94 episodes, bonus material, a great actor just coming into his stride, respectable video/audio quality and overall a well made show.  What more could you ask for!?",1393372800,84,3920,4.401388888888889

During that era there were many westerns shown on the three networks.  Some were very good, some mediocre and some downright horrible.  This was amongst those worth tuning into on a weekly basis.  I was thrilled when the complete series was offered and at a good price at Amazon.  In my opinion, this was only second to Laramie (probably the best western of the era).

3773934,5,B001R67UEA,"I've always been a big fan of Steve McQueen's work, but like many kids growing up the in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the bulk of my exposure to McQueen came from his later films like Bullet and The Getaway. But I've always enjoyed classic television westerns (moreso now that I've turned that 'post-40' bend) and I decided it was time to go back and check out some of McQueen's earliest television work. While 'WANTED"" sports very conservative production values, and the stories are all neatly wrapped up in their alloted 24-minute an episode time frame, each chapter in this series manages to tell a concise, tightly-written, sometimes humorous, and always exciting western tale. McQueen's character of JOSH RANDELL, at first, seems one-note and single-minded, but as you watch the series, you realize he follows a very strict code of honor and is much more than his 'bounty-hunter' label would suggest. Most episodes feature an up-and-coming Hollywood film or television actor/actress, and the sparkling Black and White photography is crisp and sharp. You'll soon become addicted to watching these shows, and the overall entertainment value per package is far HIGHER than you will receive from most current television series collections. Fans of the 'film' McQueen won't be disappointed, as you will see the earliest incarnations of many of his ongoing on-screen habits, manners and style.
