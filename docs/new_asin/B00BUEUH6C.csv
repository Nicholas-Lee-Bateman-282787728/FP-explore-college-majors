5674962,1,B00BUEUH6C,"Addendum: I forgot to remember the estimable Janet McTeer, who is in most of these episodes, as a lawyer assistant to (younger Damages attorney). She starred in Songcatchers, a wonderful film about a strong, professional woman, a music researcher, set in the early 20th century, who, having been once again turned down for tenure in her university, goes to stay with her younger sister who is teaching five miles by cart up a mountain in West Virginia. She collects folk songs from many of the inhabitants and we hear them in their most basic forms. There is great erotic chemistry between McTeer and a 'mountain man'.

In Damages McTeer's role is a bit ambiguous, then sort of disappears. But I always love watching her when she is on the screen.

First review: I wrote a careful review, but it disappeared. I don't feel like rewriting it. Sorry. Just unlikeable, flat, unknowable characters, full of spite and gamesmanship. I never think about this movie, these characters, after watching them. Not as I did after seeing the new British series, Broadchurch, for example. Damages is just a pasttime, until another good series makes itself available. There is nothing to learn from bleakly amoral Damages; I am left feeling vaguely dirty, unsatisfied and annoyed.

Later I saw the new series Endeavor, about the young man version of Inspector Morse, how he became a detective, how he came by some of the likes and characteristics of the Morse series; but it stands alone.

On second thought, if I can I'll change my Damages rating from 2 to 1.",1374105600,2,1543,4.833333333333333
5674963,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Whenever it comes to final seasons of shows. About 90% of them usually have let down down farewells. Not Damages. The 5th and final season picked up the pace, and ended with a series finale that withheld a strong message. Compared to the other seasons of the show, I would say that it's the second best to the first season. Very sad to see it go, but 5 seasons was enough time to tell this amazingly tragic story.",1366243200,57,413,4.3076923076923075
5674964,5,B00BUEUH6C,"From the brilliant Pilot to the series finale, this incredibly written, casted, acted show has left me wanting more when each episode is over. I assume if you are considering buying the final season, you have seen the first four and know what a masterpiece this series has been. The ending does not disappoint!!",1366243200,69,311,4.777777777777778
5674965,5,B00BUEUH6C,"This is what quality television is all about. I was skeptic about watching Damages when I first heard about it. A law show with a bunch of sociopaths running a courtroom. When I checked out the first episode, I was immediately hooked. Each episode carries on from the last, and it grapples you further into the deception and suspense. And each season has a terrific storyline. The final season doesn't disappoint. I was nervous that the last season might not be as great as previous seasons, but season 5 has just as much quality as any other. It's a shame it had to end. But then again, shows that last forever tend to lose their shine.",1363910400,84,637,4.5

5674972,3,B00BUEUH6C,"I've been a fan of Damages since it's inaugural season so it pains me to give Season 5 just 3-stars.  The story just wasn't as clever as what's precededed it and given this was known to be the final season of the show it failed to give longtime fans the closure that would have satisfied them.  The primary plot featuring a sleep walking Ryan Phillippe as an Assange/Snowden-like internet hacker/leaker who's linked to a source who appears to have committed suicide after personal e-mails of hers are leaked.  The leaker is played by Jenna Elfman who looks terrific and does a nice job in a non-comedic, albeit small role.  A wrongful death lawsuit ensues pitting Patty (a fatigued looking Glenn Close) who represents the woman's daughter and Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) defending Phillipe's character.  We're teased with the appearance that this legal drama may finally wind up in an actual court room after five seasons but this never happens.  Sub plots involving the ongoing custody battle between Patty and her loathsome son and Ellen's potentially damning testimony also never fulfills it's promise and is clumsily concluded.  Also another sub plot regarding Patty and her estranged father and a half-sister lead nowhere. Typical red herrings that suggest Ellen gets killed abound but if you've been watching Damages from the beginning you know better than to believe what you see until the end.  We also get Ellen revisiting her near murder from Season 1 and Patty's apparent confession to contracting her killing and this story line really winds up more of a distraction then generating any real answers.  At it's conclusion we're left with Ellen abandoning her law practice to raise a daughter and presumable married to her boyfriend Chris from season 4 and Patty who at one point's being considered for a SCOTUS appointment getting away with everything and continuing her ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous"" existence.  From reading other reviews I'm not alone in having hoped for more after four highly engaging prior seasons.",1471824000,2,2034,5.044776119402985

5674977,5,B00BUEUH6C,"""Damages"" is a very twisted show, which is probably why I liked it!  I like how a viewer usually knows the ""what"" at the beginning, but not the ""who"" or ""why"".  A viewer must pay very close attention to the show as there are constantly flashbacks and flash forewards.  Also, always keep in mind that there is almost always a reason for what happens in the show--no matter how trivial it may seem at the time.",1459382400,,408,4.342105263157895
5674978,5,B00BUEUH6C,Glad DirecTV picked up seasons 4 & 5 and gave us a little more to close out the series. Thankfully no cliff hanging ending but appropriate for they way the show is setup.

Then, in the final episode, for some inexplicable reason, the writers decided to kill off someone you had grown to like a lot and allow the overall villain to live and remain out of prison.  In the future, I will try to be careful to avoid watching or reading anything written by this show's creators and principal writers, Glenn Kessler, Todd A. Kessler and Daniel Zelman.

It is always refreshing to see the portrayal of intelligent people on television, and especially that of intelligent women.  For that alone it is worth watching.

5675063,1,B00BUEUH6C,"Just watched Season 5 on Netflix.  After four interesting seasons with superb performances (Martin Short and John Goodman deserved Emmys!), I was amazed with such a dismal final season.  There are no great adversarial actors to vie with Close or Byrnes (Judd Hirsch is absolutely wasted, though I'm sure he enjoyed the paycheck!) as previous seasons boasted in abundance.  Worse yet, and probably most damning, are the two lures that the creators completely discard, mainly that Byrnes will testify in the custody battle against Close and later that they will vie against each other in the courtroom, which on an essential level the whole series has been heading toward.  Neither happens!  What a tremendous letdown and F-U to loyal fans!  Instead, we are subjected to plotlines that don't develop anywhere meaningful, hackneyed turns, and implausible occurences.  Patty tracks down her son, who one moment is a homeless low-end drug dealer, but then we see him in a limo and we're provided with no explanation as to what he is doing and how he became so successful.  Likewise, Patty is up for a Supreme Court nomination, in which she expresses interest, but then . . . nothing, of course!  We never hear how it turned out.  After four seasons of Byrne wanting to take down Patty for trying to kill her and for indirectly leading to her fiance's death, she surrenders all her evidence to Patty, because she says that losing a son is worse than going to jail!  Really!?  After so many years of dealing with her former boss, doesn't she know that family means little and her career everything?  Being disbarred would render the best justice that Byrnes could ask for, but instead she just . . . hands it over!  And did they ever catch the killer of Patty's son?  We're never told, but if they did, wouldn't he confess everything, sending Patty to jail regardless of Byrne's intentions?  And the false bait-and-switch that Byrnes is dead (in one scene blood seems to be seeping from her head in a halo-like effect) is just inexcusable on behalf of the creators!  And the whole Wikileaks storyline that acts as a pointless interloper for much of Season 5 is just not as interesting as previous seasons' ripped-from-the-headlines plots.  All in all, a grand failure to an overall great series.  Stop at Season 4 and you'll be satisfied.  Sure, you won't know how their relationship turns out, but after watching nearly ten more hours, you'll be no better enlighteneed or enthralled.  Your imagination is sure to come up with a better conclusion.",1407542400,3,2540,4.846867749419953

5675123,5,B00BUEUH6C,"I had seen this show once a couple years ago but did not finish the entire episode - it was the shows' pilot.  I knew it would be interesting but somehow let it slip into the recesses of my memory.

Fast forward to April 2014.  I was perusing Amazon Video and saw an advertisement for season 5 of Damages.  It was a lazy Saturday, so I decided to see if the first impression I had years ago was accurate.  As the shows always start with ""Previously on Damages..."" I saw this intriguing storyline and was immediately drawn in.

Now for the tough decision: This was season 5, which meant there were 4 seasons I had missed.  Do I just 'jump in' and assume details from the pre-show synopsis, or do I go all the way back to the season 1.  We know I had to make the right choice and start from the beginning!

That weekend, I binge-watched all of season 1, and season 2.  I mean I only stopped for restroom breaks and food.  I turned off my phone. I closed my blinds.  I was hooked.  I repeated that scenario the following weekend with seasons 3 and 4.  I think I left the house for some groceries once.

So now I was back to my entry point of episode 1 of season 5.  By that time Patty was under my skin - I she was capable of invoking any emotion she wanted to get out of me.  Season 5, and the ultimate final show were as good if not better than any other season.  The final show ending was quite appropriate too: after all is said and done, Patty Hewes does what she always does, what she lives for. It's the only thing she knows or truly has passion for.

So to sum it all up, Excellence in drama, acting, directing, lighting, mood, and pace.",1400889600,,1642,4.139240506329114
5675124,5,B00BUEUH6C,"A spectacular finish for season 5... Loved every minute of all 5 seasons.  There's nothing like it anywhere on TV.

5675125,5,B00BUEUH6C,"No one does it better than Glen Close, the rest of the cast are all great in their roles.  This show is pretty close to how it could be in the world of high class crime.  I am sure a good percentage of the story lines are based on reality.",1400630400,,239,3.76

5675132,5,B00BUEUH6C,"When the FX channel dropped ""Damages"" (in 2011, I think), I was devastated. I was really invested in this series--excellent cast (and guest appearances), exceptional writing, edge-of-your-seat suspense from week to week! DirectTV picked up the series, but alas, I don't subscribe. Last week, I discovered that Amazon Prime offered the 2 seasons that I missed. I was delighted and proceeded to ""binge view"" until I'd finished the series finale. As expected, the high quality of this show didn't suffer from being dropped by FX. I think it got better as time went on. Glenn Close is at her maniacal best (why hasn't this woman won an Oscar?). Rose Byrne is impressive as well.

P.S. If you're looking for a light-weight drama that gives away the secrets each week, this series isn't for you.",1399852800,,789,4.888059701492537
5675133,5,B00BUEUH6C,A good wrap-up season.  Interesting dilemmas for whistle-blowing characters.  Patty and Ellen go head to head which makes Ellen resort to dirty methods to win her case. There are some rather severe damages in this season but they are on Patty's side of the ledger.  Ellen comes out alright which I appreciated since I had been rooting for her for 5 seasons.,1399852800,,357,4.725806451612903

Season 5 plot line and episodes were really put together well.  But the last episode of Season 5 was a let down compared to the rest of Season's 5 episodes (and previous Season's 1 - 4).

5675143,5,B00BUEUH6C,This series was so damn good. I'm glad she wasn't killed off in the end and that the final moments felt like a European film instead of simple American fare. The focus remained on the two female protagonists and I loved it.,1398470400,,223,4.333333333333333

5675182,3,B00BUEUH6C,"Glenn Close, William Hurt, Lily Tomlin (??!!) -- some of my absolutely FA-vorite picks. But -- NOT HERE. The acting was pretty awful. Rose Byrnes? Not an actor I would look for EVER again. Any chance she would emote ANYthing???!! Glenn -- too overdone. Lily -- oh, boy. I can grasp how a renowned comedienne might want to dip her toe into a dramatic role -- and I love her so very much (and will continue to...) but maybe she could have used much better directing -- or SOMEthing! AND William H.? OMG -- toooo overdone. In general the acting was way overdone. I saw the wrong side of my FA-vorites, for sure. I muck-and-mired my way through all the seasons because the story line was intriguing and I wanted to find out what happened. So hurrah for the storywriters. But BOOO for the casting crew -- or maybe the director(s)?? Too bad. I can only trust it was cancelled because the network saw the light? Yes, I DO feel very strongly about this failure because of my attachment to -- ergo, high expectations of -- the main actors in this show. I haven't lost faith in them. I merely am cautious now of expecting a tv series to match the actors' heights that they reached in their films . . . .",1395014400,,1193,4.354260089686099

5675184,4,B00BUEUH6C,Great show - full of twists & turns. Suspenseful! Glen Close is perfect as Patty Hewes! Sad to see season & series come to an end.,1394841600,,130,4.038461538461538
5675185,3,B00BUEUH6C,LOVE this show.  Did not quite get the twists and turns between Patty and the other characters.  Ellen was a bitter woman and I am not sure why.  Why did Daniel have to die?  Also they never clued in Ellen about Patty's sister.  Lot of plot lines hanging.  I would have liked to see a better ending.  I think Patty was a sad character and.  Glenn Close is the best at this role.  Five stars for her performance.,1394755200,,411,4.166666666666667
5675186,2,B00BUEUH6C,"I'll watch Glenn Close in anything, but the 5th season was weak. And the teaser was a cheap shot-- SPOILER ALERT: showing Rose Byrne's character in an alley, looking dead, with her eyes open, not moving. Really stupid ploy by writers. I'm surprised the actors went along with it. Of course, she wasn't dead, but through the entire season, you think she is going to fall off the building to her death in an alley. Ugh! Turned out, she only fainted or zoned out because she's pregnant. And the ending, where Michael is killed was also disappointing. Would Michael be that naive? Tell a killer he saw him attempt to murder Ellen & then expect to walk out unharmed? Since season 1-- the BEST of all, & a very good season 2, this series has grown weaker & weaker. They should never have killed off Tom (Donavan Tate). That was the beginning of the end.",1394582400,,847,4.470967741935484
5675187,4,B00BUEUH6C,"I enjoyed the first and fourth season best but this was still really good.  The flash-forwards and backs make it hard to follow at times for those that have not followed the show all the way through.  As with the season 4 conclusion, the action and intensity in the last 20 minutes really delivers.  I would have enjoyed an alternate ending but don't want to spoil anything here by giving away the series conclusion.",1394582400,,416,4.594594594594595

5675193,4,B00BUEUH6C,"While I found this series interesting, I was disappointed with the final episode.  It left so many loose ends, and felt as if someone in power said, OK lets end this.  However, the acting and technical details through out Damages is really good.  Glen Close oozed evil, and conceit. Plots were fun, and fast paced.  Thanks for having this on Prime.",1393718400,,348,4.655737704918033
5675194,5,B00BUEUH6C,"I watched most of these on TV, but then Direct TV picked it up and our cable quit carrying it.  So I'm catching up.  Went clear back to the first Season in order to not miss anything.  Love this show.",1393718400,,200,3.95

5675199,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Loved this series.  Sorry to see that this is the end but I thoroughly enjoyed all 5 seasons.  Glenn Close plays a tough hard nosed attorney who will do anything to win...and she does, most of the time.  If you are looking for an intense look at the legal system, try it out.",1393372800,,275,4.150943396226415
5675200,4,B00BUEUH6C,This season was pretty interesting because Patty and Ellen are going head to head in a lawsuit. Interesting twist at the end,1393372800,,124,4.681818181818182
5675201,4,B00BUEUH6C,"Not sure any of my favorite shows have fantastic endings. Breaking Bad was okay, Deadwood terrible, Dexter - meh!

Anyway, this season is all about Patty & Ellen going at it. For the most part it's very entertaining, but Patty's sister plot-thread is introduced but not really capitalized on. Many have complained about Ryan Phillipe. It's not that he's the worst actor in the world, but he plays (for this show) a fairly boring character. Unlike Julian Assange, who he's based on. He's not a twisted, love him or hate him character. Also he's competing with the legend of Ted Danson, who set the bar high with Frobisher, as well as Campbell Scott, William Hurt, John Goodman, etc. So he seems a dull pretty-boy in comparison. His wingman, deputy is far more intriguing.

The series leads up to a court fight that never really happens--which disappointed me. It would have been a classic free-for-all! Also, the flash-forwards to a possible ending are more interesting than what actually happens to Ellen. The Maine airport scene goes down in history as the most prolonged & boring sequence in this show's history.
Spoiler Alert:
After a decent ending, someone (Producer?) added an epilogue which is silly. Over the course of the series Ellen has slowly been turning into a monster who will do anything to win, like Patty Hewes, & ike the famous Frederick Nietzche quote. For her to have given up law for her boyfriend/husband & new child is way too pat & happy-ever-after for such a dark, twisted show.",1393286400,,1503,4.821705426356589

5675206,4,B00BUEUH6C,"Don't get me wrong, this season wasn't terrible.  It just wasn't as thrilling as seasons 1-3.  Overall this series was excellent in my opinion but seasons 4 & 5 just weren't as good as seasons 1-3.  Tate Donovan was sorely missed in the last 2 seasons.  I didn't enjoy how there was really no justice for Jenna Elfman's character.  The end of the series seemed to leave a lot of loose ends for me.  Even after all that, I would still recommend watching it because it does tie up some storylines.",1393200000,,495,4.384615384615385

Contrast that with Ellen's character, who manages to hold onto herself despite a competitive spirit and a role model capable of turpitude. The plot is sufficiently twisted and the characters are very well played. I got kind of bored with this series in seasons 3 & 4, but I am glad I viewed season 5 - well worth it.",1392163200,,500,4.5054945054945055
5675228,5,B00BUEUH6C,Excellent acting. Glenn Close is the epitome of evil.  Great writing Suspenseful. Keeps you guessing through out. I love the way they use the flash backs and flash forwards.,1392163200,,173,4.9655172413793105

5675231,5,B00BUEUH6C,Great series. You never know until the end of each season what's really happening. Glen Close keeps you guessing what's she's up to every episode.,1392076800,,146,4.88
5675232,3,B00BUEUH6C,"The series is unique and excellent. The streaming on my computer does great, but I can't watch it through TV. Netflix streams fine on our ""smart TV""",1392076800,,148,4.518518518518518
5675233,4,B00BUEUH6C,"Season 5 did not hook me in the way the past 4 seasons have done. That said, I watched, enjoyed and anticipated each episode.  Glenn Close revealed her character in her facial expressions, dreams/nightmares in a way I had not seen in previous episodes. The evolution of Ellen as seen in this season is  well done and thought provoking. This is one of the most mentally challenging and enjoyable series I have watched in a very long time.",1391990400,,437,4.589743589743589

5675238,5,B00BUEUH6C,This wraps up all 5 seasons. It helps to have seen the earlier seasons so you understand the flashbacks. We really enjoyed this whole series. Well acted and written with so many questions until the end when all is revealed.,1391731200,,223,4.6
5675239,5,B00BUEUH6C,Best show on TV. Glenn Close is amazing and Rose Byrne is her equal and the two together are explosive,1391731200,,102,4.15
5675240,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Fans of Damages were looking for some thread of resolution between Patty Hewes and Ellen Parsons as the series came to a close.
While the budget with Direct TV could not attract heavyweight actors anymore, Ryan Phillipe did an admirable job as the whistleblower webmaster who has anger issues.
Jenna Elfman continued the show's excellent utilization of comic actors in a dramatic role.
Chris Messina, also mainly a comic actor, does a terrific job as Ellen's old friend who returns from tours in Afghanastan with issues and dirt on a military contractor.
In the end the head to head courtroom battle between Patty and Ellen is undermined by each character's tragedies and the ability  to move on with life.

One of the best TV series I've ever seen.",1391644800,,749,4.84375

5675248,1,B00BUEUH6C,"Not my cup of tea. The only character I liked was brutally killed in the first episode. The viloence inflicted upon innocent people and animals really does not appeal to me. I'm sure the acting was wonderful and the writing likewise, I simply did not feel it was something I wanted to inflict upon myself for the sake of ""Artsy and Dark"" TV entertainment.",1391385600,2,355,4.5625

The flashbacks are a little creepy and certain camera angles and shots that are held a second or 2 too long give away the plot, but it still keeps you wanting more.  Great main characters so strange they make you feel good about being normal.  Makes you wonder if everything in life boils down to money, power and greed.  I choose to believe not.

5675267,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Glenn Close is SO good as the ""take no prisoners"" lawyer.  She brings her character to life effortlessly and makes us believe she really has a broken psyche but doesn't admit it even to herself.  I couldn't wait for the next episode.  The story grips you from the very beginning.  Lots of guest star appearances, riveting story lines and great acting.  Wish it hadn't ended after 5 seasons.

5675269,5,B00BUEUH6C,It was a real knockout of a season.  Each season got better and better as the series progressed which is rare in my opinion.  The dynamic between Ellen Parsons and Patty Hewes is one of the ages.,1390867200,,195,4.243243243243243

5675278,4,B00BUEUH6C,"I have not finished watching the entire series yet, but the main strength is the quality acting of the leads as well as the supporting actors. Great work by all!",1390435200,,161,4.4
5675279,2,B00BUEUH6C,"On the ending to Damages, star Glenn Close (Patti Hughes) said, ""I was conflicted about it when I first read it. I went to the writers and I said, 'The image you're leaving us with is that a woman in power is a loser - the ultimate loser,' - because Patty has all her power, but she's without intimacy, without love, without family...""

Part of what made the show great originally was the idea of Patti Hughes capacity to screw with peoples' perception of her as an stereotypical ice queen.  She was that cool, ambitious, female in a man's world.  As Obama campaign spokesperson, Samantha Power, famously said of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 campaign, she was a ""monster.""

But unlike the prototypical subjugated woman, Hughes was self aware about it, and in fact she got off on it.  She loved that people feared her, and used it to her advantage professionally.  The final season and episode of Damages, paints Hughes as a victim of the 'ice queen' syndrome.

Not only are we to believe that the sexist stereotype against ambitious women is true, but we are to believe that Patti Hughes ultimately is the embodiment of it.  The series also reduces the complex relationship between Ellen Parsons and Hughes into a crudely imagined cat fight.

Parsons prosecution of Patti which frames the season, takes the series from being a complex psychodrama and commentary on female power, to the territory of The Devil Wears Prada, the Real Housewives or Mean Girls.  Patti Hughes is the Queen Bee, and Parsons must end her reign of terror!

So Season 5 of Damages largely betrays all the principles that made its thriller story lines so compelling, and Glenn Close's performance so riveting.  Hughes is reduced from a complex, almost literary character, to a crude two dimensional ""bitch.""",1390262400,,1779,4.815789473684211

This show had tremendous potential with the stellar acting of its impressive cast, and great premises for the various seasons. But like Lost and the recent M.

5675347,4,B00BUEUH6C,"For five seasons, TV viewers who have followed Damages have been privileged to watch powerhouse civil attorney Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) pull every manipulative and often illegal trick in the book in taking on and usually taking down a variety of corporate fatcats and sleazeballs. Not even cancellation by the FX network could slow down the show, which was picked up for two additional seasons by DirecTV in a move that added some nudity and a good bit of profanity to the already potent dramatic mix. Finally, the show comes to an end that could have been one of TV's all time best if not for a poorly thought out epilogue.

As with each of the previous seasons, Damages concentrates on one big case, usually a very timely one. This time out, Patty helps her former associate and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), who now has her own fledgling legal practice, land a huge client, the owner (Ryan Philippe) of a Wikileaks-like whistleblower website. Patty's motives are not altruistic, since her goal is to ensure that Ellen can't testify against her in a custody case her estranged son has filed to regain custody from Patty of Patty's granddaughter.

With the help of an employee (Jenna Elfman) of a major investment bank, Philippe exposes the bank's involvement in a big insider trading scandal. Unfortunately, he also exposes Elfman's personal romantic improprieties in a series of personal e-mails that were also posted on Philippe's site along with the financial hanky panky. Soon, Elfman is dead, an apparent suicide, and Patty, representing Elfman's daughter,  brings a suit against Philippe. What viewers know, but Patty, Ellen, and the authorities don't, is that Elfman was actually murdered.

Most seasons of Damages have had good central mysteries, and this one is no exception. Finding out who was responsible for leaking Elfman's personal information and killing her, along with why, occupies most of the season, and the eventual revelation is somewhat surprising. However, entertaining as the mystery is, the real highlight of the season is watching Patty and Ellen slug it out as opponents in a major case. Indeed, Ellen's transformation over the show's five seasons from innocent law school grad to a younger version of Patty is fascinating to watch, and Rose Byrne is up to the task. Indeed, the entire cast (with the exception of Philippe, who makes almost no impression), which includes Janet McTeer, Victor Garber, M. Emmett Walsh, John Hannah, Judd Hirsch, and William Sadler, provides the usual high level of acting viewers have become accustomed to on this show.

Still, the show has always revolved around Patty, and Close's performance this season is masterful. She faces assaults from all sides: Ellen, her estranged son, her dying father, and some skeletons in her closet from past seasons that come home to roost. Watching her strain and threaten to crack, while never being sure what she'll do next provides a testament to her acting skills.

Which brings us to the actual conclusion of the show. The secrets are finally revealed, and the result is a powerful dramatic moment, albeit, in the show's usual manor, magnificently underplayed. Unfortunately, the writers were not content to exit on that fitting note. Instead, they tack on a two-minute epilogue that dilutes much of the impact of the earlier few scenes. Viewers who have followed Patty and Ellen for five seasons of turmoil will not be satisfied (and I deducted a full star from my review as a result, from 4 1/2 to 3 1/2 stars).

Still, two minutes of poorly thought out exposition cannot destroy the enjoyment viewers will have in the preceding ten hours of this season or the show's entire five-season run for that manner. Damages goes out as it came in, one of the best dramas on television.",1388534400,,3805,5.001579778830964

5675379,4,B00BUEUH6C,"This series is not for the faint of heart, but the writing has generally been outstanding.  Season 5 hasn't quite gripped me the way all the previous seasons did. I found the flashbacks to Season 1 over-used, and the similarities to previous seasons, like seeing Patty sitting stoically in the police station, may have been used to create a kind of symmetry, in fact the almost certainly were, but, for reasons hard to articulate, I found this irritating at times.  I also didn't understand the motivation for tension between Patty's son and Ellen except, obviously but somewhat incongruously, to ramp up the pressure on Ellen.  I think Ellen had enough pressure on her already.  I haven't yet watched the last two episodes, which will undoubtedly give me whiplash from the exciting twists and turns, and maybe I will decide that all is redeemed in the end. You have to watch these seasons in order, and Seasons 1-3 were brilliant, probably 4, also, with 5 just a bit less brilliant in my view.",1387497600,,994,4.761627906976744

5675390,4,B00BUEUH6C,"I had watched the first four seasons of Damages on Amazon Instant Video, and was dismayed to see that Season 5 wasn't offered. That was several months ago, and imagine my surprise to find it offered, while checking what was newly offered on Amazon Prime. Now I need to go back and watch the entire series again. I have learned that watching a series this way is so much better than the week to week watching on TV.  Still, the series does frustrate me with all the flashbacks. I just did not see that that was necessary. I don't like the constant switching back and forth from future, past, present etc. That is the only reason I gave this series 4 stars. Someone else said that Ellen and Chris had no chemistry, and I must agree. In Season 3, Timothy olyphant was Ellen's lover, and that was some real chemistry. I was very sorry to see him leave the show, but guess ""justified"" was calling!",1387152000,,892,4.406060606060606

5675397,2,B00BUEUH6C,"It was more out of curiosity than enthusiasm that I embarked on Season 5. I had enjoyed the first three seasons: interesting plots, excellent casts, and the non-linear way the stories unfolded (flashbacks and flash-forwards) kept one a little off-balance and focused. But Season 4, in my opinion, was a disaster - contrived and implausible  and I had no idea whether in Season 5 the series would return to the quality of the first three seasons or remain mired at the level of Season 4. The good news is, Season 5 is better than Season 4. The bad news is, that is faint praise.

Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) has always been depicted as hard-nosed, but in Season 5 her behavior toward her son became gratuitously mean. Rose Byrnes performance in the series never really grabbed me  she came off too wimpy to be a big-time litigator, and nothing I saw in Season 5 led me to change that opinion. In fairness to her, that largely may be due to her inevitable comparison with Close. The series has made an effort to be topical, and in Season 5 this takes the form of Channing McClaren (an indifferent Ryan Phillippe), a character inspired by Julian Assange. But the story was uninspired, and the season seemed tired, like an aging boxer coaxed out of retirement for one, last, ill-advised payday.",1386892800,,1288,4.665198237885463
5675398,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Incredibly well written, directed and acted.  Perhaps not to everyone taste if you want fast moving action, but if a serious drama with two very talented woman appeals to you , this is the show to watch.",1386806400,,203,4.486486486486487
5675399,4,B00BUEUH6C,Wish I had watched this when it was active on television.  Thank you Prime for making it available for those of us that didn't watch it before it was taken off the air.  Really enjoy Glenn Close as Patty Hewes.,1386720000,,210,4.225

5675403,5,B00BUEUH6C,"This series is a refreshing star of first-class intrigue and double- reverse deception. Talk about absorbing. I had missed the last few episodes and made them up one afternoon. Close and Byrne are exceptional. The director and writers are flinchingly wise for portraying what appears to be a complicated plot actually born out of the old, simple vibes of home and motherhood. Jealousy and pride are at work here in high fashion. Top notch!",1386547200,,439,4.945945945945946

5675414,5,B00BUEUH6C,"My wife and I got so hooked on seasons 1-4 that paying for season 5 as soon as it was available was totally worth it. Glenn Close and other regular and guest cast members were fabulous throughout, lots of questions were addressed but not necessarily answered, and the ending was probably inevitable and realistic, but very much worth watching. Damages as a whole was one of the best series I've seen on television in recent years. The only problem is that it took us three seasons to figure out the addictive theme song lyrics. Hmm. The darn thing is now stuck in my head again!",1385769600,,578,4.514285714285714
5675415,4,B00BUEUH6C,"Far better than season four and nearly as good as seasons 1 & 2.  While the producers still seem enamored with promoting stereotypes of the traumatized and mistreated war Veteran while demonizing service contractors to the DoD it was far more subdued in the final season.  In case it's not apparent, I really disliked season 4.  Season five had more creative and plausible story lines and the acting was very good as it has been throughout the series.",1385683200,,451,4.756410256410256

5675430,5,B00BUEUH6C,"People have been saying television is experiencing a new golden age.  Programs like 'Damages' are proof positive that this is true.  Excellent writing and acting.  I don't really get why some reviewers are panning the 5th season saying Ryan Phillippe's acting was wooden.  Didn't they watch the episode about his character's son?  That episode explains his behavior quite nicely.  I like the way each season focused on a different case that mimicked what's going on in the real world, and I liked the way they kept you guessing all season long till the climactic finale.  Am going to miss Damages, but believe it's wise for them to go out while they're on the top of their game rather than dragging it out for a few more seasons for the money.",1384905600,,743,4.6692307692307695

The characters absolutely draw you in so that you feel you  are living their lives.  The fifth season was incredibly good. I was on the edge of  my seat and watched the entire season over a two day period.  I must say, this is one of the best series of all times. I am truly sad that it is over but I will definitely re-visit again in the future. If the fifth season was less good than its predecessors, it is only because while watching, I knew that it was a bitter-sweet ending of a roller coaster ride that would be no more.  In my opinion, if anyone had watched any of the prior seasons, they would not need to be convinced or urged to watch the final season; they would have absolutely no choice in the matter!",1384819200,2,856,4.126506024096385

5675434,3,B00BUEUH6C,"Very disappointed in this last season of Damages. I felt no chemistry between Ellen and Chris...zero. Ellen seemed overly aloof and cold...Glen Close was fabulous as always and was the saving grace for me....but the rest was rather boring and choppy.
Have no idea why Ellen's parents even had a role.

Ending was okay...just not up to par with the rest of the seasons.",1384819200,,368,4.75

5675439,4,B00BUEUH6C,"Loved the whole series, but was rather disappointed with the ending. I thought more story line  should have been devoted to showing how things ultimately end up for everyone.
While I agree it ended as it should, such a strong series should have packed a little more drama into the end.

Definitely a show worth getting into.",1384646400,,418,4.9714285714285715

5675443,5,B00BUEUH6C,"The entire season was spellbinding! As usual, the acting was superb and the wardrobe to die for. The camera loves both Glenn Close  and Rose Byrne.

5675444,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Season 1 was a tough act to follow. Season 2 was uneven and probably cost the show viewers. Season 3 was close to being back on track. Season 4 was weird and not essential. However, in this final season, the writers are back to Season 1  quality and tension. There are multiple allusions to the first season and many of the open plot lines are being  addressed. Acting is back to the season one standards. Directorial tension and creativity is restored. Rose Byrne has grown as an actress and she has her best season ever.

5675448,4,B00BUEUH6C,"This was an amazing season.  The actors were compelling and the plot was very good.  I love the wikileaks correlation.  I gave it four stars because I am not happy about the turn the show has taken since moving networks.  I don't like the language or explicit sex.  I think the show was smart enough and didn't need that to make it interesting.  Still a great show.  Glad it is over though, as I don't think this network would be able to live up to the first three seasons.",1384387200,,473,4.247191011235955

5675452,3,B00BUEUH6C,"The quality of the writing really dropped off in the last season.  The story was very thin, and the repeating dream sequences that didn't advance either the story or the character development got to be very tiresome, and there were too many holes and inexplicable plot twists.

5675454,3,B00BUEUH6C,"While many things about this season were up to a certain standard that the show had set for itself, they were still only barely there. We needed more from the leading man--Ryan Phillippe is no Ben Cumberbatch--so it made for some difficult patches: long involved back & forth over this miserable website business, which frankly, didn't strike me as even remotely intriguing. So, it all rests on Pattie and Ellen, once again. *sigh* They're great, but they just can't carry the whole show; that's why it seems padded. The character played by Judd Hirsch was terrific! That's the good news.  The bad news is that they appear to have forgotten to give him a story arc. M. Emmet Walsh is a hoot as usual. Janet McTeer is *almost* wasted.
Watch it if you must, but there's not a lot of real satisfaction, given that it is the series finale.",1384300800,,835,4.604026845637584

5675456,4,B00BUEUH6C,A great way to wrap up one of the most engaging shows in TV history. It's a shame more people haven't seen it. Glen Close nailed her role and really made you hate her with every inch of your body. One of the best shows in the Golden Age of TV.,1384300800,,243,3.784313725490196

Patty's continued descent into total depravity was compelling by Glenn Close.  I was sorry to see the series come to a conclusion.,1383955200,,304,4.611111111111111

No need for the reprisal here.",1383868800,,334,4.583333333333333

The storylines were complex, timely and managed to tie up the entire series quite well.  Of course, the acting was crazy good as it's always been.  But, Glenn Close took Patty to another level that was at times, heartbreaking to watch.

Glenn Close is simply the best. I have watched the series 4-5 times from beginning to end. Season 5 surprised me - I always thought Patty or Ellen would end up dead - the ending was nothing like I had expected which is typical of the series.

5675486,5,B00BUEUH6C,I really enjoyed this series.  Love the twists and turns.  A little to violent for my taste but it is a violent story.  I think I need to watch the whole series from the beginning to catch what I missed.,1383436800,,203,4.025

And finding Season 5 on Prime I had to pace myself as it's addicting.  Such a shame other series can't be this compelling, though the time jumps are hard to follow, the time they jump forward or back are realistic time frames, so no suspended belief.

Thankfully, I got Amazon Prime, and I was able to see the 3rd, 4th, and now the 5th and final episode.  I hate to see it end.  I usually don't like lawyer shows, but Glen Close plays such a spiteful, conniving witch, and it is so much better to watch episode after episode instead of waiting week to week.  The ending of each episode puts you in suspense until the next episode.  She will do anything to get her way.  I would highly recommend this series.

Every single episode of every season I have listened and watched those few minutes with some kind of fascination and a reasonable supply of goose-flesh.

I'm not sure there could have been a totally satisfying ending to a series I didn't want to end. But if it had to be, this was both the story and the conclusion that this series needed for its final season. Moreover, should the opportunity ever arise to revive this franchise, it could be done. Whether either of the two stars would ever feel up to it is altogether another matter.

My only complaint, and that is probably too strong a word, is that in a final season I would prefer little or no use of flashbacks and flash-forwards. Maybe I'm alone in this--""Damages"" generally is proof that you can bounce a viewer around in time and strengthen the narrative. (For the complete opposite, I nominate ""Lost."") I would like to except from this generalization the final moments of the final episode of ""Damages,"" which, as with so many series' conclusions, takes us a few years into the future. But I can't. Neither can I offer an alternative. So, while I can't except it, I will accept it.",1383091200,,1329,4.556485355648536

But both sides become tainted by the personal desire to win. They both dabble with the underworld, of course, and I have known lawyers who did this out of necessity or ambition. It is a very interesting series.

After five years of fighting and some intense drama, I felt this series left with a whimper not a bang. Story line about the Whistler Blowing blog was pretty weak, and even though it drew Ellen and Patty into an almost court battle, and they played well against each other, the Ryan Phillipe character was not very well drawn and he seemed pretty stiff,  not very realistic, especially being surrounded by actors who came off much better, what I was most disappointed in was the fact that Michael really had to pay for his mother's sins, I can't for the life of me understand why he never told Ellen that he saw the guy that attacked her, and why he felt he had to try and be a hero, it just really wasn't in his character, but the most disappointing aspect of this season was the end, dragging us into the future, showing a somewhat glamorous Patty and Ellen having given up practicing law, to me completely and utterly unrealistic, because she was as ruthless as Patty, and had a law firm going that had a great future, that she would give all of that up to marry Chris and become really nothing (or nothing that was explained) took this series down for me from great to just average, an exciting first three seasons, a somewhat weaker fourth season and an utterly disappointing and weak fifth season.",1382832000,3,1386,4.799163179916318

5675531,2,B00BUEUH6C,"LOST, Heroes, Revenge, Prison Break, Under the Dome... Damages... what do they have in common? They all should have ended after one or two or, in the case of LOST maybe four seasons. But human greed is such that a consensus emerges to squeeze the last tortured penny out what started as a good or great show and could have ended that way. IF it ended in time.

Damages had a great first season and a so-so second season. It should have ended then but it didn't and, like all shows of its kind, it quickly descended into weirdness and extreme plot stupidity. What we could call 'great acting' on season one degenerated in the principals repeatedly 'striking the pose' in the last seasons. And the initial good scripts are now pathetic kitch-level cliches that are painful to follow.

As for the last season's plot... this time the bottom-feeding scriptologists decided to exploit Assange and his Wikileaks. And the writer might as well have been working for the NSA or maybe he/she does. Hard to tell and hard to differentiate. Assange is portrayed exactly the way those super-confidential and over-secret NSA briefings describe them: irresponsible and dangerous, egocentric sex-maniac, possibly crazy, never to be trusted. All a repulsive and uninspired caricature that might have passed as North Korean propaganda. Maybe.

It's all a big bore and it's crude and subtelty goes down to the level of moronic. Take this from episode two, I believe: Ellen observes Patty being friendly with the judge that presides over the case on which the two on opposide sides so Ellen does a number of clever tricks and forces the judge to recuse himself. Then... Patty calls Ellen and says ""things are never what they seem"" and then... here's the hidden camera, showing the same scenes that fooled Helen into believing that Patty and the judge were sweet but in fact the opposite was the case. No they didn't do a voice-over but it was almost like they had it. It's all like the fifth-grade level video class. Boring, stuttering and ridiculous.

Alright, I didn't watch beyond episodes 2 or 3. We all live for a limited time after all and time wasted can never be unwasted.

Watch a couple of episodes if you must and if you can get them for free on the Flix or Amazon Prime and decide for yourself.",1382659200,,2284,4.728643216080402

Rose Byrne seemed as though she was petrified of Glenn Close even when she actually had the upper hand. I think I would be too! Glenn Close could DRILL A HOLE THROUGH YOU with one look.",1382400000,,498,4.134020618556701

Season 5 suffered from one glaring problem.  A 2-hour story line was stretched into 10 episodes.  The rest of the time was filled with endlessly repeating dream sequences and flashbacks that added little to nothing.  Just plain boring.  If the story had been cut down to 2 hours, it would have been good.  There were a few interesting and unexpected twists, and some poetic justice.  But slogging through the chaff to get to the wheat just wasn't worth it.  Not by far.  Don't waste your time.  If you want to know what happens in this final season, simply read a summary.

5675580,1,B00BUEUH6C,"SPOILER ALERT
What an absolute cop out ! Season 4 ended with the shock twist that ellen parson's was going to tell all against patty hewes at her grand daughter's custody hearing. A few minutes into season 5 and that storyline gets conveniently dropped in favour of ten tedious episodes that all lead to a trial that then never even happens !
Worse than all of this is that for those ten episodes we're led to believe (ie. lied to) that parson's has taken a swan dive off her office roof. Did she fall, was she pushed ? Neither, she conveniently fainted right at that exact spot thanks to an illness that is only  revealed in the final episode itself - parson's has got to be the only person in medical history who fall unconscious with her eyes open !
Not since The Sopranos has there been such a 'screw you' from the writer's to the fans of a series, in the form of outright deception on their part - who pull the old Saturday-morning-picture routine of showing the hero go over a cliff in a wagon only to reveal the following week that the hero had long jumped out of the wagon before it even reached the cliff !
5 years of my life wasted watching a show that ultimately never went anywhere because it never had the guts to put its money where its mouth was !
Oh, Ryan Phillipe - you may think you're the next John Malkovich, seeing as youve spent your entire career ripping him off with your moody pouting and endless smoking, BUT YOUR'E NOT ! That would require talent on your part, something Malkovich has in grand-canyon-size proportions whereas your own wouldn't be adequate enough to fill even a tea spoon.
All in all a colossal dissapointment, one which the creators/writers should hang their head in disgrace over!
Next time I see their names alongside a tv series I certainly won't be watching - fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...",1379548800,6,1852,4.447058823529412

5675589,3,B00BUEUH6C,"I thought the final season was a let down compared to the first three.  Fourth was better than the fifth season.  Seemed to be just something written in the script to take up time in a lot of areas.  Too much going back and forth to a scene that had already been shown a few times.  Seemed like no real depth in what they were writing just wanted to end the series..

Be aware that you probably did not get full episodes.  The final episode had 10 minutes cut out of it.  What I ordered advertises Damages: The Complete  Fifth Season but when I received mine it said Damages:  The Final Season.  I contacted Amazon about the last episode especially being cut 10 minutes and they issued me a replacement for what I ordered.  (Damages: The complete Fifth Season)  The replacement I received today was exactly what I received before.  I did not open it and  I am returning it also and asking for refund.  I did some research and found on another site where people contacted Sony about the final  episode not being complete and Sony finally responded to one of them.  I removed any personal info and am listing what Sony's  response was.

She appeared as if she was sedated most of the time-slow and dreary. Whole season lacked subtance-failed to really move along etc. Very disappointing . V.S. Adelaide,1377993600,,310,4.867924528301887

5675622,4,B00BUEUH6C,"I began with the debut of ""Damages"" on FX and met the news of its cancellation and subsequent move to DirectTV with dismay. Having waited forever for the release of Season 5 on DVD, I can say that while the final season doesn't compare to Season 1, it's still great TV. The events unfold faster than in previous seasons as there are fewer episodes than in past seasons.  The suspense and backward ""reveal"" trademarked in ""Damages"" remain.  Glenn Close, in her portrayal of villainess Patty Hewes, is remarkable. Close gives Hewes, a flawed, inscrutable, merciless, and contradictory character, an edge that, while not sympathetic, requires empathy from the viewer. We see the evil in Hewes; but, Close's gift is that we can also see what isn't evil about Patty. Watching Close give Hewes dimension is still one of the best offerings on TV.  Rose Byrnes has grown in her role of Ellen Parsons, Hewes' protge, conscience, and foil. Byrnes, however, like the rest of the cast, is simply outshone whenever Close appears.  Close isn't a scene stealer, but your attention, along with the camera, will follow her as if the other characters have been grayed out. She is riveting.",1377475200,,1171,4.869346733668341

5675624,2,B00BUEUH6C,I love this series but the fifth season was a total  disappointment. Rehashing old episodes and scenes that were pointless and were too long. The whole thing could have been made as a two hour movie. The story could have been developed so much more to make it better. It looked like a rush job and something that had to be made .After the first season there really was a standard to be held to. Ryan Phillippe is totally not up to the mark. A nice twist at the end and the story is finalized so no more mediocre seasons to come.,1377388800,,528,4.176470588235294

5675631,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Damages had me hooked from the 1st episode. The twists and turns in the plot, using both out-of-sync time sequences and unexpected outcomes, keeps the viewer engaged and eagerly anticipating the next episode.

5675634,3,B00BUEUH6C,"Although the final season of Damages was disappointingly short, everyone remained true to their reputations. In comparison to previous seasons this one was a bit boring and too repetitive with the characters dream sequences but plot lines were resolved reasonably well, some better than others, which is probably typical when any series concludes. I don't regret the time spent watching but it wasn't at all what I had hoped it would be.",1377129600,,437,5.083333333333333
5675635,5,B00BUEUH6C,"All good things must come to an end and perhaps it is best that Damages ends after 5 seasons before the stories start to repeat themselves.  Instead the writers have delivered another season of outrages and skullduggery.  The wrap-up was a bit unsatisfactory to long-time watchers, considering that you know it's the last season from the outset, and while it does achieve closure it is not with the panache that is the hallmark of this series, I guess that's about all I can say about the ending without spoiling it.  This season, as the last season, does assume that you have been watching, and a true newbie would be completely lost as to the overall story, not to mention missing a lot of allusions; if that's you, go to Season One first and work from there.  It is a great series and you won't be disappointed.",1377043200,,814,4.554794520547945

5675641,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are perfect together. After a disappointing fourth season in which a bunch of characters that I didn't care about took up huge amounts of screen time that I would have rather seen go to Glenn and Rose, I was extremely happy that the fifth season focused so much on Patty and Ellen. The legal case of the season was merely a backdrop for the crazy love/hate battle raging between the two women and I loved every minute of it.

I can't believe Glenn Close did not receive an Emmy nomination for this season. ???!!! She was as brilliant as ever in every episode, but it was her performance in the finale that totally blew me away. It was, without question, the best acting I have ever seen.

The bloopers are awesome! My only complaint with this dvd set is that there are no audio commentaries. I was really hoping that Glenn and Rose would finally do one together. They've both done commentaries for previous seasons, but they were always paired up with other people. It would have been such a treat for fans to hear them chat while watching an episode, but it never happened. Bummer.

I'm so grateful that Glenn Close decided to do the show. What a gift it was to be able to spend so many hours with such a talented actress.

Goodbye Patty Hewes and Ellen Parsons. Goodbye sweet Cory.

Season four good also especially for John Goodman.
Was happy season five happened and tied up many things.  Patty really did want to have

Quite a disappointment to me. Why is it so hard for so many great series to find an ending that lives up to their body of work?
I felt like this episode had a thrown together feeling. I left the series feeling like ""all of that, for that?"".

was the Arthur Frobish storyline in a previous year and Ted Danson in the lead role.",1375056000,14,322,4.295081967213115
5675684,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Having watched all 5 seasons now I am at a loss since this was such a huge pleasure to watch.  Luckily it is also the kind of show I will go back and watch again in its entirety.  This season does not disappoint.  I have read the reviews and some say it is boring and badly written/edited...I wonder if they have seen any of the other seasons because the editing was spot on and followed the theme of the whole series.  Also, this is a closing season which means we all needed a little more time to allow the characters we have all grown to love to move on and wrap up the whole story.  Where as previous seasons the final episodes are packed with mystery and quickness only to get you to the final minuets where all of the little details find their place and lock up the entire seasons story, this finally also had the task of forever wrapping up the stories that we have followed for years.  I didn't want it to end.  This is a show worth every award, incredibly acted, directed, scripted, edited, produced.  I assume it will take ten years to find another show of this caliber.  Luckily I can re-watch all of these in the mean time!",1375056000,12,1135,4.266355140186916
5675685,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Awesome series! I wish it didn't end in only 5 seasons. However, they wrapped it up well in season 5. If you haven't seen this show before, start from the beginning. From minute one you will be drawn in. If this were a book it would be a page turner for sure!",1374969600,,259,4.0
5675686,3,B00BUEUH6C,"This last season got a little tedious. Too many flashbacks. Too many flashbacks. Too many flashbacks. And while I loved the surreal qualities, at times I found myself losing the characters I knew so well. Patty became a caricature and Ellen looked like she'd been lobotomized. But, it got better, and I loved the whole series in the end.",1374883200,,337,4.728813559322034
5675687,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Without getting too much into detail on the plot with the final season, I would like to just take note how excellent each season has been, with the first & second as my favorites. It's kind of sad to see the show end so soon, because I feel like it was really able to bring together great stories & cases to life that have been very relate-able to current events. Glenn Close is outstanding and I have always been delighted with the guest stars the show brought in. I bought this season on Vudu because it was cheaper then Amazon surprisenly for the HDX version. It's a shame they only brought the first season out on bluray. I recommend this show but make sure to watch it from the first season since it's not exactly a show you can just jump into.",1374883200,,749,4.28169014084507

5675689,5,B00BUEUH6C,"Such a good show, a bit underrated imo.
Superb acting, great story line with enough suspense and still believable.
The ending really made me cry a bit.",1374883200,,151,4.62962962962963
5675690,1,B00BUEUH6C,"I have watched all of the previous seasons of Damages and found them to be entertaining...and sometimes excellent...as in the episodes that had John Goodman as one of the lead actors.  BUT...this Season 5 episodes are atrocious in quality.  Editing is so bad that if you have not watched previous seasons you would have no idea what the show was about.  The writing for Season 5 is minimally acceptable...even for television.  I don't know what happened to Glen Close in this Season 5 as she seemed to be a shell of herself smeared in grossly applied red lipstick and watery eyes that appeared to be that of a 90 year old person(some 90 year olds). Perhaps she is just reaching that age when it is best to just retire from such a public profession.  The other lead female actress appeared the same although she is many decades the junior of Close.  Maybe they were both hitting the booze too much in real life as their characters portrayed in the show.  And just maybe they both knew this was it for the show and didn't give their best efforts.  Regardless, Season 5 of Damages is a mess...bad writing...terrible editing...poor acting...and not even acceptable photography...and being that it was shot in and around NewYork City...there is no excuse for the bad filming.  This stuff should be free on Netflix or Amazon Prime...it certainly is not worth the $16 I paid Amazon for it...save your eyesight on this one!",1374883200,3,1415,4.719512195121951
5675691,5,B00BUEUH6C,"I rarely buy TV Series DVDs, but thanks to not having access to this final season (the show went satellite and off cable) I went for it.

There are the usual ""you just THINK you saw"" moments and loved the resolution of so many questions from past seasons. The only ""left hanging"" moments are about the Supreme Court (nominated, but will she get it? Can you imagine vetting Patty Hewes?) and her son's daughter (assume she got her after what happened to Michael in the finale, but nothing shown on screen).

Having watched ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" multiple times, I was delighted to see John David Hannah featured in this series finale. Great storytelling as usual, and I will so miss the Battle Royal between Rose Byrne and Glenn Close since 2007. So many twists in the final episode you need to REALLY pay attention!

Another review said ""boring"" which is ludicrous - the only 'slow' episode was the airport lounge scene in Maine, but it set up just about everything that followed. Dramas like this make you pay attention and assume you're keeping up...and what a great alternative to these silly CGI comic book summer movies!

So if you liked the DAMAGES series before this final season, you will LOVE these episodes. They also do enough background/flashbacks to bring you up-to-speed should you have not seen previous seasons. Loved the flashback reminders (in the text as well as visuals) of the very first season (Ted Danson's Frobisher). There were dozens of ""guest stars"" in past seasons that today have a name for themselves or renewed their visibility (just check out [...] for an amazing list).",1374796800,3,1609,4.79783393501805

5675701,5,B00BUEUH6C,"What a host of great actors doing what they do best creating sometimes likeable, but often despicable characters.  I loved this series and every new case and continuation of old ones.  I didn't see it as ever 'slow', but more of a series of crescendos.  Were this characters likeable, moral, uplifting?  Oh, hell no.  For every tiny good quality they had something lurid to expose.

The one problem I did have with it was the ominous sense of Aesop's Fables at the very end.  The stomach turning feeling that the writers or directors were trying to convey a morality to all this fabulous sorted mess.  Was it that women in order to live a full, womanly, sanctimonious life they must leave power behind?  Was it that absolute power corrupts absolutely?  Was it if you try to win at all costs the costs are often too dear?  I have come to the conclusion that whatever they were trying to say at the end was the only mistake they really made here.  For whatever it was - or wasn't - that 2 minutes of sour taste wasn't enough to spoil my appreciation of the full series - though I would be inclined to deduct 1/2 point, if I could.

Make up your own mind, but until then - Enjoy!  Just be grateful that the script writers are so poor at moral platitudes.",1374192000,,1251,4.3826086956521735

5675704,5,B00BUEUH6C,"This is definitely an all time t.v. series with all actors at the top of their profession. I have to say that Close was the only actor that could have pulled this part off.  She can say more things with just her facial expressions, than others can do with their voices. Just watch her eyes and you realize that you are dealing with someone that can chew you up and spit you out. She also did a great turn on acting in The Shield. It would be hard for me not to rate this 5 star. Great series!!!",1374105600,17,494,4.040816326530612
