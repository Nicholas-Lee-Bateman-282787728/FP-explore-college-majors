3055612,4,B0010YPT7Y,"I love Russian literature and films. There's a profound darkness laced with a profound sense of humanity that makes these films and books work for me. Dostoevsky, Gogol, Tolstoy, Solzhenitszyn are writers I always want to read. They show us our failures and our despairs, but they do so in such a way that we end up feeling that we can finally succeed no mater what the cost.

PU 239 is a work that comes close to a mark set by those writers. It has a hero dying of radiation poisoning who is struggling to secure some money for his wife and son so that they will be able to survive after he's gone. This hero's determination and his philosophical musings will have you thinking about the film long after you've seen it.

What doesn't work as well in the film is the comic gangsters. The plot requires them, but their silliness undermines the existential situation of the dying hero.",1227484800,,883,4.5125

Although a bid depressing in nature, there is some comic relief provided throughout by some of the supporting cast playing 'clueless mob goons'.
Shot on location in several parts of Russia, it gives a good idea of what life is like in post cold-war Russia. I watched it with my girlfriend whose Russian. Although not a big fan of these kind of tragic dramas, she liked it because the scenery was accurate. I would recommend it.",1221868800,,485,4.7176470588235295
3055614,4,B0010YPT7Y,"Another winning movie set in Russia. A worker in a nuclear plant, of the usual unsafe Russian design, is caught in an accidental radioactive steam leak. He is isolated behind sealed doors and sees his comrades look at him and walk away. When the event is over he is showered and his dosimeter badge is taken. He is told that his exposure is survivable but the ultimate blame is laid on him rather than the faulty design and protocols. He is now home with his wife and child with no job, no income, and a suspicion that he is being lied to. He finds his original dosimeter badge and sees that he has received a lethal level of exposure. Again, a Russian is dealt a deadly hand. Soon his body begins to fall apart. His hands need to be bandaged. His appearance is frightening. True to form, he hatches a plan to steal some Plutonium 239 and sell it on the black market so that his family will be able to survive without him. Nothing left to lose.

The theft itself is a little hard to believe, but when we see this poor dying man going out into an open air market with a cardboard sign reading merely ""Pu239"" we step into the other world. Our logical western minds shy away and say that this cannot be happening. This man is accosted by a street thug who thinks he controls the local market. Best line of the whole movie is when the thug asks our hero ""What is Pooh?"" What follows is a classic story of desperation, ignorance, greed, and simple stupidity. As westerners we might find this movie as being highly improbable, but as a Russian I can vouch for the reality and anguish of this film. By viewing it, Americans can maybe appreciate how dangerous the world we live in is without the added artificial threat levels being screamed at us everyday by our 'leaders'.

3055616,5,B0010YPT7Y,"PU-239 is a relativately unknown movie. I came across the preview on some other movie a few months back and was intrigued by it.

The other reviews have summed up the plot pretty well, so I won't bore you with more of that.

PU-239 is a dark suspense Russian gangster movie, with alot of comedy mixed in. The acting in the movie is pretty good, considering the mostly unknown cast.

3055617,5,B0010YPT7Y,"A film with such an unusual title is bound to be interesting, and ""Pu-239"" certainly delivers.  Timofey (Paddy Considine) is a worker at a Russian nuclear plant who receives a lethal radioactive dose and sets about providing for his family in the few days he has left to live.  He does this by purloining Plutonium, chemical symbol Pu-239, not quite as well known as its cousin U-238.  Shot on location, ""Pu-239"" is an English-language foreign film, with some familiar faces such as Rhada Mitchell as Timofey's wife, and the usual cast of colorful but unknown Russian gangsters.  Least expected is the fact that Plutonium is hilarious!  Paddy hooks up with Shiv, a small-time crook, and his two out-of-control associates who resort to stealing windshield wipers and dog-napping as sources of income.  Laced amidst the dark humor are startlingly insightful meditations on light's wave/particle duality, or the substance of a mushroom cloud consisting of fear.  Facts sprinkled throughout the movie are all accurate, such as an interesting sidebar about the painters of radium-dial watches in West Orange, New Jersey who began to die from hideous oral cancer, as they tended to moisten their paint brushes with their mouths.  The combination of story, dark humor, nuclear fact, and philosophy render ""Pu-239"" an intelligent and worthwhile film.",1209600000,17,1342,5.238317757009346
3055618,5,B0010YPT7Y,"Personally, I might have used a different title for this film; after all, how many people know that ""Pu"" is the chemical symbol for Plutonium? Once you're past that, though, this is a really great movie with terrific acting. The black comedy moments, alone, are worth the price of ""admission"". It has a sad, but realistic ending.

Of course you will have poor attention to ""quality control and oversight"" if your entire existence is devoid of any possible hope of making ones lot in life better. This entire ""wealth redistribution"" B.S. that our current Mr. Hopey Changey seems intent on establishing will lead to circumstances much like those shown PERFECTLY in this great film.

While this was a low budget film, it delivered intrigue and drama.  At the start, the viewer sees a nuclear meltdown and the subsequent cover-up but there is so much more to the event than initially understood.  At points throughout there are passing commentaries on the futility of life that causes the watcher pause.

I recommend this to those who like indie movies.  It had a powerful message as well as a terrific unwinding of what it means to trust the state unquestionably.  This is a movie I would watch more than once to catch what I missed in the first viewing.",1416960000,,797,4.609929078014185

3055676,3,B0010YPT7Y,"when you undertake a professional film project where accents are involved, it goes without saying that you employ a language advisor. what you need to take into further consideration is that not all actors are linguistically gifted, in which case the overall result will be cheapened through no inherent fault of the actors. alternatively, you hire foreign actors for the parts with accents for authenticity's sake OR you make the movie in unaccented english. moreover, writing an authentic screenplay with consistent syntax for non-native speakers requires a good deal of expertise.

to my mind, the directors should have made the movie either only with accented foreign actors or all in english. the result is disturbingly mediocre from a language point of view, which is tragic because i'd otherwise give both the plot and premise five stars!

granted, i'm a phonetician and an instructor of russian language, so i might be considered ""picky""; nevertheless, i found it difficult to enjoy the jumbled accents and syntax of the actors and screenplay to the point where an otherwise five-star movie became a difficult-to-enjoy three-star experience.",1406505600,4,1149,5.3076923076923075

Out of work, dying, and with a wife and son to look after, the desperate scientist steals a vial of plutonium with the intention of selling it on the black market. He subsequently becomes involved with some dangerous criminal types, the type that became so common in this time period in Russia, and his life becomes intertwined with theirs. The tragic drama unfolds as the man desperately seeks to make some money for his family before his inevitable death. The film, although sad and serious, is laced with dark humor throughout.

I'd love to watch an edited version and find out what happens. I will never understand why movie producers feel the need to make language so bad. If it was occ use I could have blocked it out but it is constant. So if language bothers you this is not a movie for you.

Laced amidst the dark humor are startlingly insightful meditations on light's wave/particle duality, or the substance of a mushroom cloud consisting of fear.  Facts sprinkled throughout the movie are all accurate, such as an interesting sidebar about the painters of radium-dial watches in West Orange, New Jersey who began to die from hideous oral cancer, as they tended to moisten their paint brushes with their mouths.  The combination of story, dark humor, nuclear fact, and philosophy render ""Pu-239"" an intelligent and worthwhile film.",1209600000,17,1342,5.238317757009346

Of course you will have poor attention to ""quality control and oversight"" if your entire existence is devoid of any possible hope of making ones lot in life better. This entire ""wealth redistribution"" B.S. that our current Mr. Hopey Changey seems intent on establishing will lead to circumstances much like those shown PERFECTLY in this great film.

At the start, the viewer sees a nuclear meltdown and the subsequent cover-up but there is so much more to the event than initially understood.  At points throughout there are passing commentaries on the futility of life that causes the watcher pause.

3290173,3,B0010YPT7Y,"when you undertake a professional film project where accents are involved, it goes without saying that you employ a language advisor. what you need to take into further consideration is that not all actors are linguistically gifted, in which case the overall result will be cheapened through no inherent fault of the actors. alternatively, you hire foreign actors for the parts with accents for authenticity's sake OR you make the movie in unaccented english. moreover, writing an authentic screenplay with consistent syntax for non-native speakers requires a good deal of expertise.

to my mind, the directors should have made the movie either only with accented foreign actors or all in english. the result is disturbingly mediocre from a language point of view, which is tragic because i'd otherwise give both the plot and premise five stars!

granted, i'm a phonetician and an instructor of russian language, so i might be considered ""picky""; nevertheless, i found it difficult to enjoy the jumbled accents and syntax of the actors and screenplay to the point where an otherwise five-star movie became a difficult-to-enjoy three-star experience.",1406505600,4,1149,5.3076923076923075

His employers claim the incident was his fault and refuse compensation, even going so far as to produce a false radiation test that downplays the extent of his exposure. Out of work, dying, and with a wife and son to look after, the desperate scientist steals a vial of plutonium with the intention of selling it on the black market. He subsequently becomes involved with some dangerous criminal types, the type that became so common in this time period in Russia, and his life becomes intertwined with theirs. The tragic drama unfolds as the man desperately seeks to make some money for his family before his inevitable death. The film, although sad and serious, is laced with dark humor throughout. Considine's character also narrates the story, and I enjoyed the rather poetic element that this adds to the film.

I'd love to watch an edited version and find out what happens. I will never understand why movie producers feel the need to make language so bad. If it was occ use I could have blocked it out but it is constant. So if language bothers you this is not a movie for you.
