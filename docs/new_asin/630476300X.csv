928918,5,630476300X,"Charming, sweet, funny, little feel-good romantic comedy film. Absolutely love Jane Wyman in this flick (had not seen her in a movie before). Main character shines. Cute plot, adorable premise, where a small-town girl becomes a stewardess and, before too long, her sunny personality means that she is brightening lives. She meets three men named Mike who become her suitors. There is some really clever dialogue in the script. As a small-town girl by birth,  though my fave genre is sci-fi, I found this movie utterly enjoyable. If you love classic films, with an old-timey sweetness, you will likely adore this silver screen gem. Happy viewing~*",1489968000,,646,5.09433962264151
928919,4,630476300X,"Some might see this movie as average, or 3 stars but I gave it that extra star because it's just a sweet movie dating back to a cleaner and more simple time. The plot is not complicated...she meets three men, all named Mike and has to choose between them.  Yep, that's pretty much it, but it's so nice to see a clean movie again. I'm so tired of the filthy language and so called 'adult' situations in today's movie.  The woman gets 3 marriage proposals before she has even kissed one of them and not a foul word throughout.  It's fun to see how times have changed, so many cultural differences have transpired in the last 6+ decades since this film was made but not sure they have been for the better.  Just nice to take a trip back in time to a simpler time.",1489190400,3,760,4.220689655172414

928921,3,630476300X,"I am a sucker for old movies, and this one doesn't disappoint in terms of the nostalgia factor. Marcie (Jane Wyman) is a stewardess. On her first day working for American Airlines, she meets the first Mike (Howard Keel) of the show. Later, she meets the next Mike (Van Johnson) on the job as well. And still later she meets the last Mike (Barry Sullivan) in a completely different scenario. Each romance develops at it's own pace, with only one of the Mike's shining by an almost imperceptible fraction as the possible winner of Marcie's heart. I would say the way the show progressed, it was not too clear who the front-runner was until the end. Now, one of the charming things about old movies, is the corny way certain things take place. (Who can't use a little corny in their life?) But, there were a few situations which were a little too much for my taste, though not enough to discount the show as one to pass up. Spoiler (ish) Alert: The end in particular was tough to swallow. Faced with all 3 Mike's begging for her long-term affection, Marcy chooses 1 in front of the 2 others and they just stand and wave at the newly coupled pair while essentially say: ""Ah. Oh well. Ha, ha!"" And sure, you don't want any of the characters to fall on the ground in despair...but, as I said, maybe just a little too much corn in the ending for my taste. Still, I think, worth a watch on a rainy day.",1486944000,3,1394,4.365384615384615

929010,3,630476300X,"A movie to marvel at how far back airlines have fallen in providing passenger comfort and service. And a great long free commercial for American Airlines. Airline stewardesses in 1951 were envied by women and idolized by men. Three Guys Named Mike builds up on all this lore to make a movie that most women of the time would have adored. A glamorous job with exposure to desirable mates. For ultimately, the goal was a good catch in marriage--an event that, if realized ,disqualified stewardesses until the 1980s. In the film, Jane Wyman's Marcy character, who loves being a stewardess, does no hesitate to give the job up for a MIke. A fun movie which, for our more feminism-conscious times, has lost some of its luster and appeal. (Except for the 1 1/2X wide seats, full meals with silverware, and maybe a chance to sneak one's dog into the passenger section for a quick visit). 3 1/2 stars.",1474588800,2,893,4.658227848101266

Van Johnson has always been a favorite of mine since I can remember watching his movies as a child. Though I must have missed this one during my childhood watching Dialing for Dollars and Noon Movie classics. Yet reading his bio and others reviews of his life, they left allot of his movies out. Keen I recognized from JR Houghings father on Dallas, wow he is really young here. The 2nd Mike I've never really care for as an actor but he seems to be good at playing intimidating and bad.

It starts in a small town in Indiana. Marcy Lewis is going to Chicago to be an airline stewardess. She is rejected at first, until she shows her personality. She opens up to the manager and is hired. We see life in the 1940s. The girls get a physical exam and learn their job. They are assigned to their flights. Will Marcy do more than is required? Passengers step aboard, their names are written down. This airliner has two propeller driven engines. Can she serve lunch? They forgot the food! They must return to the airport for the lunches.

Marcy is assigned a new route, Chicago to Los Angeles, which uses a four-engine airplane. One passenger reads a book. The sleep on a long flight. A little girl wants her dog. Their hotel room has a Murphy bed. She is grounded for a week! If the stewardesses pool their assets they could rent a house. Marcy meets a Graduate Research student at a restaurant. A push can start a car with a dead battery (manual transmission and a generator). Some passengers ask Marcy for a date. An advertising executive wants an approach to sell soap. Marcy drives to that house. [Note its style.] Friends come to help her move in. Fog cancels her flight.

Marcy sees an example of bioluminescence, or cold light. Michael won a scholarship. Teaching is important. Marcy has a suggestion for advertising Gardenia soap. Airline stewardesses must be single. One flight cant continue because of the weather, they need a hotel. The president of that company liked her idea and gives her a bonus. Marcy is called away for photographs. There are complications afterwards. Marcy pleads for the three Mikes. Which one is right for her? There is a scene at the airport with the three Mikes. Which one will she choose? Its against the rules.

This is like an advertisement for that airline. It tells what a stewardess does for the passengers. It also documents life in the 1940s (as seen by Hollywood). It has some subtle comedy. Would it be better if is also had singing and dancing for more entertainment? Was that man speaking a foreign language added for a reason?",1409184000,,2119,4.657754010695188

929955,5,630476300X,"THREE GUYS NAMED MIKE is a movie from the second best year of my life, namely, the year that I was born.  The best year was the year that my daughter was born, which by definition came a bit later on.  Anyway, the film is a 90 minute black and white comedy about a newly trained stewardess, and three upper-middle class courters.  All three are named, ""Mike,"" thus the title of the movie.  All three of these Mikes readily become infatuated with the stewardess, and pursue her for marriage.

THREE PERSONALITIES.  Mike #1 is the first to appear, and he is an airline pilot who happens to give the stewardess a lift when her cab breaks down.  It is my guess that few people would consider an airline pilot as suitable ""husband"" material, all other things being equal, since he is away from home all of the time, and is not allowed to chit-chat with the wife when he is at work and in the cockpit. Mike #2 is an advertising man, which is probably a plus in terms of making a fine husband.  Mike #2 first meets the stewardess when he offers roadside assistance when the stewardess' battery in her automobile goes dead. However, Mike #2 as played in this movie, is an older man, and probably is not optimally compatible with the stewardess who is in her early 20s.  Also, Mike #2 has formulated the idea that the destiny of the stewardess is to bear him six children.  Hence, the viewer of this movie might also decide, well before the ending, that Mike #2 would be less favored as a husband.  Mike #3 is a passenger on an airplane, who bumps into the stewardess at a second location, namely at a restaurant where he is bartending.  He seems remote, when he is a passenger, because he is busy reading a book, and is not interested in chit-chatting with the stewardess.  Mike #3 is a biochemistry graduate student, who on occasion, bartends on the side to supplement his meager stipend.  Mike #3 is doing research experiments on bioluminesence.  I was shocked, but pleasantly surprised, when Mike #3 explained the substrates and enzyme involved in bioluminesence.  In a scene in Mike #3's laboratory, the viewer is treated to a one liter Erlenmeyer flask filled with glowing bacteria.  I was shocked that the biochemistry of luminescence would be described in a movie dating from 1951.  The stewardess is not at all fazed by Mike #3's description of biochemistry, and she very easily pronounces ""bioluminescence"" and in fact, she recognizes Mike #3's supervisor because she had read his biology textbook when she was in school before becoming a stewardess.

This movie is a product of its era, in part, because of the film's emphasis on biochemistry.  Please recall that Hans Krebs got the Nobel Prize in 1953 for discovering the Krebs Cycle (just 2 years after this movie came out).  But in additional aspects, it is further evident that this movie is a product of its era (see below).

THE ERA IN HISTORY.  All three Mikes represent the ""New Wave"" of culture, which materialized after World War II.  This New Wave of culture has been documented in abundance in history books, films, and other media.  The 1950s brought technological advances, including boosts to the commercial airline industry resulting from the onset of radar and other inventions that materialized during WWII.  The media, novels, and literature, from the 1950s and 1960s, also glamorized and sometimes demonized the advertising executive.  Please see, for example, the films TWELVE ANGRY MEN, which depicts the glib manner of a handsome ad-man.  Please also see, A STOP AT WILLOUGHBY, and WALKING DISTANCE, which are Twilight Zone stories depicting the high-pressure nature of the advertising industry. In this time in history, if you were Puerto Rican, Mexican American, or African American, you were marginalized in the job market, and also mariginalized in movies.  Such is the case in this movie.  Also, in this era, women were expected to cook and make babies and to not have a career.  This aspect of history is presented in this movie, but this movie (believe it or not), fights back, and the stewardess is depicted as an intelligent person and not in any way as a bimbo.

HANKY-PANKY.  This film is filled with mild references to hanky panky.  For example, in a scene about an airplane, an elderly man tries to get a date with the stewardess, and as part of his insistent ploy, gives the stewardess the keys to his hotel room.  Another elderly man, farther back in the airplane, is equally insistent in getting a date with the stewardess.  Thinking quickly, the stewardess agrees for a date with the elderly man at the rear of the airplane, and she hands him the hotel room keys.  The elderly man's eyes glow happily with anticipation and excitement.  In the laboratory scene, Mike #3 tells the stewardess that he needs to switch off the lights.  For a moment, the stewardess thinks that he is going to try some romance, but she quickly learns that instead it is so that she can observe the light from the glowing bacteria.

MAKES YOUR HEAD SWIM.  After a half hour, it is apparent that THREE GUYS NAMED MIKE is intended to be over the top.  The stewardess chit-chat with each other giddily, in mindless happy-talk.  Every 10 or 15 minutes or so, there is a chance encounter where two of the Mikes bump into each other.  Eventually, there is one scene, where all three Mikes are in the same room together, and learn that they are not alone in pursuing the stewardess.  And after that, near the end, there is a scene where all three Mikes get in a fist fight with each other, where a photo of the fistfight appears in a tabloid, and where the result is that all three Mikes either lose their job or are demoted at their job.  The take-home lesson is that, if you do not like fast-paced movies that have improbable, over-the-top storylines, and that make your head swim, then do not watch this film.  But if you do not mind over-the-top storylines, then this film will be engrossing to you.

CONCLUSION.  I liked this movie for the above-disclosed reasons, but also because there was no violence, no computer graphics, and no naughty words.  But most of all, I liked this movie because of its disclosure of the biochemistry of luminescence.  Please note that, green fluorescent protein was the subject of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in the year 2008.  At the end of the film, all three Mikes meet again (purely by coincidence, of course) at the airport, and all three Mikes ask the stewardess to get married.  She says ""no"" to the first two, after each asks, ""Will you marry me.""  Then the proposal from Mike #3 goes like this, ""I love you.""  Because of this truly unusual approach, which Mike #1 and Mike #2 had neglected to use, the stewardess agrees and answers yes to the biochemist.",1385251200,2,6761,4.6887192536047495

930091,4,630476300X,"Jane Wyman's character is probably in her early twenties, and ready to leave home for adventure.  For her, that adventure lies in the skies, working as a stewardess.  But little does she know the real adventures awaiting her involve three very different, and nice, guys, all with one thing in common:  their names.  The first Mike she insults and he can't stand her at the start, but then quickly comes to her aid when she makes a mistake that could have gotten her fired from the airlines.  The second Mike helps her out of a jam when her car breaks down, and soon is attracted to her enthusiasm for life, and wants to use that for his advertising business.  And the third Mike, well, Jane can't quite figure him out at first.  He's so quiet, and yet not snobbish, and she tells her stewardess friend on the plan she thinks he's someone very important.  Well, she starts to get to know him, not at some conference with him speaking, but right there on the plane when he teaches a child who refuses to sleep on the overnight flight about the stars.  What happens next I shouldn't say, as part of the fun of the movie is seeing it unfold, with all the drama, comic mishaps, and also quiet scenes where Jane gets to know the Mike she'll come to love.

I like the fact that there was actually more depth to this movie than I expected, with discussions between characters that reminds me of real life choices.  Such as, do you want to settle down and have one home, or is it more important to you to be able to travel all around the world?  Do you want to live the fancy, rich life, or is a quiet life with a family in a small town, perhaps a college town, more your style?  Jane has to make all these decisions and more.

Even at the end, I feel like there could have been more chemistry developed with the Mike's and the roommates. It was a bit flat. It's difficult to find a film that is not filled with sexual innuendo or outright explicit scenes or language.

On the movie side, it is surprisingly strong after all these years. Sure, some of the script is predictable but the energy of Jane Wyman and the rest of the cast is infectious.

They show people trying to do good and not trying to be outrageous just to get attention. They show people being modest and not trashy. The plots are what movies should mostly be . . . a good ending that ties everything up. You feel good when you finish. Pure escapism. A look into the what airline travel was back then was interesting. And too see Howard Keel . . . from Dallas fame (to me anyway) . . . as a good looking young man. I liked how the movie showed real people making mistakes, not just glam'd up movie stars or like most movies today that just show everyone rich, famous, not working, having the biggest and the best, etc. Movies back in the 50s seemed to show working folks without making them seem depressed or oppressed.

She is well qualified; her bright personality and eagerness to succeed make her popular with her passengers. In fact, she is especially popular with men, and the ones named Mike take the biggest shine to her.

She meets the first Mike (Howard Keel) on her first flight. He is the pilot, but a mistake makes him dislike her at first. Over time, the two become quite chummy, and when she's assigned to another flight, she's rather sad she has to leave him.

The second Mike (Van Johnson) is a passenger on one of her flights. She tries very hard to win him over, but he only seems interested in his books. They meet again later, though, and he begins to take her out.

The third Mike (Barry Sullivan) is a businessman who helps Marcy on her way to the airport. He takes her out to nightclubs and promises to give her financial security.

This is a lighthearted, fun film that keeps its audience entertained the whole way through. The ending is satisfying, and it is a delight getting there. The print on this edition is far superior to my expectations and there are a few entertaining, although random, extra features included.",1296172800,3,1246,4.549107142857143

I always remembered it and was shocked to see it was on DVD. I prefer older movies everything was classier back in those days. The weren't always in bed int those movies people respected each other. I loved seeing how stewardesses use to be,boy have things changed now. The only downfall was watching it in B & W, other wise it was a pleasure to watch.",1262822400,2,420,4.329113924050633
930175,5,630476300X,Great movie and great cast. I love Jane Wyman and who doesn't love Van Johnson and Howard Keel these are real men. If I had been Jayne in the movie I would have had a hard time choosing between them. Any movie with these actors in it is worth having and watching over and over again. It is a must have classic DVD.,1252713600,,314,4.0
930242,1,630476300X,the movie was good but this copy is very bad you can get a better copy watching tv,1232841600,2,82,3.611111111111111
930243,4,630476300X,"The movie is great fun, but the producers of this DVD really made it a ""no-frills"" product--not even a menu for scene selection.

Overall the service was good, the movie came quickly, and the movie itself is enjoyable.  I'm a Howard Keel fan, which prompted me to buy the movie, and he does a fine job as one of the Mikes interested in Jane Wyman.",1222732800,3,347,4.323076923076923
930244,5,630476300X,"Three Guys Named Mike is one of those movies where you want to watch it over and over. While a bit far-fetched (what woman could ever perfectly meet the needs of three different men?) it is a sweet movie in the best tradition of chick-flicks. There are no bad guys or fast action, but plenty of good, laughable lines, and great chemistry between the stars.",1220140800,,356,4.492307692307692
930245,4,630476300X,"Great period comedy about a feisty young woman in search of a career as a stewerdess (and a husband).  This is a 'don't miss' for fans of Jane Wyman.  As an airplane buff, I found the airliner/airport scenes wonderful.  Great production values and costumes.",1202860800,4,257,4.795454545454546
930246,4,630476300X,"""Three Guys Named Mike"" is a delightful film.  Jane Wyman finds herself in the precarious situation of having three guys fall for her all at the same time.  Each of the gents have differing personalities and pluses and minuses to offer if she chooses one of them as her spouse  but the ""good guy"" who wins does so because he simply has his LOVE to give to her.  Expect to laugh and have fun as you cheer for your choice of the three candidates. Great acting--you get the feeling that they probably had a good time while making this film.",1196553600,2,537,4.34

930250,5,630476300X,"I absolutely adore this film.  Jane Wyman is so adorable.  She plays a spunky, all-American girl stewardess in this film that stays off the ground more than on it.  Howard Keel is very sexy as her favorite pilot (Mike #1, as I affectionately call him).  Keel has, in other movies--especially his musicals--displayed a tendency to overact.  Not so in this picture, in which he is extremely masculine and likeable.  Van Johnson, who has had the same problem, is very sweet here.  For some reason I have never bought into the ultra-suave characters he has played in other films, such as the ones with Esther Williams, but he is adorable as a cute nerd.  Mike #3 is the one that virtually no one cares about, and I can't remember who plays him for the life of me.  It is actually difficult to predict who Jane will end up with, which is refreshing.  I alternated between rooting for Howard and Van, but I think the best man wins out in the end.  Please watch this movie!  You'll love it!",1114992000,18,983,4.491525423728813
930251,5,630476300X,"I love Jane Wyman! This movie is very sweet. This is definitely a movie for women to enjoy. Unlike the previous reviewer/Howard Keel fanatic, In my opinion, the choice became clear, little by little, through subtle means, which Mike was right, and the last scene clinched it. I don't know the quality of this tape, but the movie itself is a keeper. This is one of those they-don't-make-'em-like-they-used-to's! I wish more of Jane Wyman's movies were available; she was such a good actress.",1073260800,26,490,4.9156626506024095

Airline travel used to be so much different. This movie is romantic, inspiring, and a wonderful trip back in time.",1525564800,,318,4.3

Spoiler: Always pick the man that would go out of his way, to set up your whole house.  The others walked off.. that was a big sign that he was a great guy!  I is not about looks, it is about kindness and character.  The others were clearly not ready to settle down... they still wanted the whole world.  ;)",1522195200,,439,4.228915662650603
