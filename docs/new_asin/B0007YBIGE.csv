There are a few things that don't fully fit with the original story, but it's a lot better than the Disney version of the movie.  This fairy tale was not meant to end in a very happy way, and the movie depicts this very well. It may be sad, but it's true to form.  I love it. ",1143158400,4,360,3.8904109589041096
8181759,5,B0007YBIGE,"I absolutely LOVE this film!  When I was little, I watched this movie every weekend at my grandparent's house.  In my opinion, it's ten times better than the Walt Disney version.  This movie follows Hans Christian Anderson's original tale fairly accurately.  Marina, the blonde, anime mermaid, really touches your heart.  The ending is sad, but true to the real story, and there is some partial nudity.  All in all, it's a wonderful film, though extremely hard to find.  A must-see.",1123804800,4,482,4.95

It's selling for over $25 where I can find it used. I really wish someone would buy the rights and start making it again.",1121990400,5,269,4.1923076923076925
