2762292,2,B000NA1W4K,"Gangs of the Dead could have been a good movie given the prmise. The biggest problem I had watching this movie was with the heavy set guy with the wool cap. I guess he was supposed to be the BAD dude, the MEAN dude, the BOSS. Well, he was most of all the ANNOYING dude.

They didn't really need the zombies here. They had him. Sometimes these scripts can be written with a little bit too much 'over acting.'",1226016000,2,407,4.151898734177215

2762295,3,B000NA1W4K,"Plot: A meteor shower turns people into zombies. Members of two local rival gangs are trapped in a warehouse when all this goes down.

The movie is ok, it has brief, very brief, glimpses of okish acting. The film is too dark (as in lighting) and it is hard sometimes to make out wha tis happening. The special effects and the zombie make-up were decent.

The plot was annoying considering that half the characters were annoying and you just wanted to see the zombies eat them (Cesar and Latasha). Latasha, played by Dayana Jamine, even with bad acting, managed to introduced one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen. The character of Cesar, played by Noel Gugliemi, managed to prove that testosterone in emergency situations proves fatal.

Although the movie was ok and somewhat entertaining, the interactions between the characters was frustrating. The movie basically had stupid characters.",1203292800,4,904,5.013333333333334
2762296,3,B000NA1W4K,"I'm a bit wary of reviews based on content and acting for a film like this.  As an avid horror fan (zombie movies in particular), I generally know what to expect when going into a film like this.  When I notice a zombie film I've never heard of before, I pretty much know what to expect: bad acting, poor production quality, sub par effects, etc.  Now, this is a great rule of thumb if you're trying to steer clear of said downfalls.
For a horror fan such as myself, though, I can definitely enjoy the ""camp-factor"" of a low-budget horror film.  I can laugh at the bad acting and poor effects, and cheer when the predictable events unfold, as if I'd seen the future.

The point I'm making here is that ""Gangs of the Dead"" is by NO MEANS a breakthrough film, but it's a lot of fun to watch and the production made great use of an obviously mediocre effects budget.  The CGI is surprisingly decent (TV quality even), and they definitely made a smart move in saving a good chunk of the budget for the death effect on one of the main characters (not going to spoil it - it's definitely Fulci-esque).  Noel G (aka Noel Gugliemi) was the best actor in the film for sure (perhaps it's because he's always the same guy).  The rest of the cast was pretty laughable - especially the girl playing Latasha.  Her whining and whimpering had me in stitches for the majority of the film.

In summation, I'd advise any fan of super campy horror to take a look at this movie.  It's not the best, but it'll keep you laughing for a while.
Steer clear if you're looking for a Romero film.",1184976000,12,1567,4.332191780821918
2762297,4,B000NA1W4K,"Wow. An urban horror movie I enjoyed! Holy crap in a pita I think I almost had a heart attack there. I said ""urban horror"" and ""enjoyed"" in the same sentence...generally there's a ""did not"" in between those two but with this movie the ""did not"" can go on vacation. (Notice how I skillfully used a sentence dragging on about my use of common words and notice the skills I'm showing in getting you to read this explanation explaining it which pertains to nothing other than a waste of space and time. Congratulations. I've won.)

Anyways, the film started off in a very non-typical way, a comet crashes on top of a group of religious homeless nuts and soon turns their corpses into green slime spewing zombies. Two rival gangs are getting together in a nearby warehouse while the police observe as a deal between said gangs goes down. As things take a turn for the worst they get much worst when the zombie horde discovers the police squad waiting outside to arrest the gangs and starts munching down. Stirred up by all the commotion the gangs take a peak outside to find the police being torn to bits by the undead. A pair of officers barely makes it out by the skin on their teeth and rushes into the warehouse. The group soon realizes they must work together to survive as the living dead outside try to bash their way in. Can two rival gangs and a couple of police officers manage to not kill each other before the zombies do?

Well peeps, that's something you're going to have to find out for yourselves because I'm not going to give it away BUT there's plenty of guy munching and zombie carnage to please even the most distinguished zombie fan. There's even a nice scene involving someone's jaw and a horde of hungry zombies - you ever seen a human Pez dispenser? Now is your chance.

This movie was really enjoyable. Not poorly acted, although some actors/actresses were better than others and some of the dialog was stale and flat but most zombie films have this flaw along with the lack of logic on the characters' part (that's in here too) but the film still manages to work. With some creative shots, nice gore effects, and some of the better low budget acting I've seen in a micro budget film - GANGS OF THE DEAD is a fun zombie romp. It chills. It thrills. Most importantly, plenty of the red stuff spills.

The one thing that would've solidified this into getting a 4 star review would have been more of the gore and less talking. There's a few points in the film where all the characters do is talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, by the time they're done talking you have no idea what they were talking about and just want to see someone get killed. Thankfully someone knew what they were doing because they either deliver on the kill part or shove more zombies in our face in their rotten glory. I also must point out these zombies look awesome. Full face appliances give them a nice rotten look and of course the few background zombies with minor gore and face paint are present but hell they're awesome too! For a film with such a low budget, it had a great EFX team. Now the CGI...well even though it's only used for things they needed it for - with the exception of head shots, squibs people; SQUIBS - that doesn't look so great. But it's a low budget zombie film, if you're expecting George Lucas' CGI effects - move on, this one's not for you and you're no longer fit for human interaction.

All in all, the film has it's flaws but it has it's high points. Just like any other zombie film out there. Give it a shot, what have you really got to loose? Aside from the money it will cost you to either rent or purchase it and the 88 minutes you'll be watching it but other than that - what? Like you have something better to watch. Go on, try it out.",1178755200,7,3767,4.38340486409156
2762298,3,B000NA1W4K,"This is one of the better zombie movies. What could have made it even better was more attention to either of the potential romantic couples: the black gang boy and his friends' sister or the young cop and the Hispanic gang leaders' girlfriend. More attention should have been given to either and one couple should have survived. The chemistry between the young cop and the Hispanic lady came to late in the movie. The chemistry between the black gangster and his friends' sister did not go anywhere. Blossoming love, even in a B-level zombie movie always adds to the quality. There was too much profanity. I love the fact that this zombie movie was in the ""hood"". I also liked the fact that the zombies looked more than like people with flour splashed on their face, but not their necks, and dark eye shadow painted on. The script was not the best, but this was one of the better zombie movies. I will definately watch this one again. With very little tweeking this one could have been a -4-.

The basic storyline is two rival gangs meet, indavertantly, with a man to do some form of illegal deal, while under the watchful eyes of the police. A meteor hits nearby, turning a bunch of homeless L.A. folks into zombies. From there it goes downhill as this film turns into a somewhat amateurish version of what a zombie movie should be, almost a comedic effort. The special effects are terrible (with one face-ripping exception) and the acting was absolutely unbelievable. If you really don't need your 20 bucks, buy this movie, otherwise, there are several better zombie movies available. I wouldn't even recommend this to an Iraqi Insurgent, for it would probably make them redouble THEIR efforts against us for offering this garbage to them. Terrible. I want my 90 minutes back!

2762330,1,B000NA1W4K,"Gangs of the Dead (Dwayne Stinnett, 2006)

If you're like me, you're probably here because you saw Reggie Bannister's name and said okay, Reggie Bannister's in it, might as well give it a shot. I've been finding over the past few years that Reggie Bannister, when not paired with Don Coscarelli, is not enough reason to watch a movie. This was just the final nail in a coffin sealed by such forgettable tripe as The Rage, Sigma Die!, Fallen Angels, and Wishmaster.

Plot: you know how there was that one test you didn't study for in high school, and you spent the entire day until seventh period hoping the zombie apocalypse would happen and get you out of it? Yeah, it's kind of like that, except the test in question is a major drug deal where the cops have managed to score front-row tickets to a score that can put cuffs on big names from two huge rival gangs, or so they think, until the zombies show up. After that, it becomes just another run-from-the-zombies movie, indistinguishable from dozens of others, except in the places where most of those others are better.

That, of course, is the problem with basement-budget horror films whose directors are out to make a quick buckthey're not putting any effort into thinking up something interesting to do with the story, the effects, anything. It's just a question of assembling the  various parts of a bunch of other movies in a slightly different order, troweling on some vaguely decomposed-looking makeup, and shooting something that can be stuck on a DVD and sold in one of those eighty-packs of low-budget horror movies you can find at Best Buy for twenty bucks. I guess, considering the source, I can't ask for much, but even with no-budget specials, you occasionally get a movie that really does something interesting with the script (Oxygen is a good example) or where the director at least cared enough to sift through until he found some really good actors to work with (Noctem). This feels like an assembly-line production at best. Skip it. *",1391644800,,2010,4.734285714285714

It's a zombie movie with the usual extraterrestrial, meteorite origin.  It hits the skid row section of what I assume is a West coast city, with the derelicts becoming the first victims.

The action takes place in a warehouse.  Two rival gangs show up at the wrong times for illicit dealings. Police, tipped off by an informant, are the first victims of the zombie mass.

2762347,2,B000NA1W4K,"GANGS OF THE DEAD (2005) - This is neither a good or bad zombie horror flick. It is what it is. Filmed under the title LAST RITES and also released as CITY OF THE DEAD in some foreign territories, this low-budget flick opens with a meteor containing alien spores hitting a bridge, where a homeless street preacher (Terrence Evans; THE PUMPKIN KARVER - 2006) is prophetizing the end of the world to his homeless flock. He was more right than he even realized. He and the rest of the homeless crowd are turned into flesh-hungry zombies and begin chowing down on every human they meet, including the wife of the local TV weatherman, who just happens to have the last name Weatherman (Cazimir Milostan). He hoofs it to a warehouse, where two gangs, a Black one and a Hispanic one are making a deal for weapons or drugs (it is never made clear) with supplier Mitchell (Reggie Bannister; PHANTASM - 1979, who has nothing more than an extended cameo). They are also being staked-out by the police outside, who decide to make the arrests, but the homeless zombies attack them and only two cops make it into the warehouse (Mitchell is hit by the police van, smashing him into bloody pieces). The two cops want everyone to put their differences aside and work together to get out of the warehouse, but Hispanic gang leader Caesar (Noel Gugliemi, listed in the credits simply as ""Noel G"") will hear none of it and eventually becomes head douchebag in charge, killing one Black gang member by shooting him in the head (after the gang member dares him to pull the trigger!) and using everyone else as bait. What he doesn't know is one of the gang members is a snitch and that's why the police are there to begin with. The zombies begins to rip apart the cast one-by-one until only a few are left (Caesar suffers the bloodiest death and it is very well done), using a box of hand grenades to kill the rest of the zombies. They make it outside, only to discover more meteors hitting the skyscrapers of the city. Is there no hope left for humanity?  While there is some bloody gore that sometimes surpasses the film's R-rating, there is also some dodgy CGI, especially in the explosions (it is easy to differentiate real flames from CGI ones). Director/co-writer/co-producer Duane Stinnett (his only feature directorial effort at the time of this review) offers nothing new to the zombie genre and the screenplay, which he co-wrote with Krissann Shipley (who stars as Cassie, the female member of the Hispanic gang), makes some of the characters seem retarded, especially Latasha (Dayanah Jamine), the sister of one of the Black gang members, that you just want to strangle them. Sure, the film is stupid, badly acted and cheap as hell, but it is worth at least one viewing if you can't find anything better to watch. Also starring Howard Alonzo (listed simply as ""Howard""), Ethan Ednee, Ryan King, Enrique Almeida, Danny Martinez, James C. Burns and Stephen Basilone (listed as ""Steve B."").

It looks as though they couldn't afford lights so that most of this rubbish that takes place in some old warehouse is unviewable - it proclaims to ""star"" Reggie Bannister (who obviously needed the $17 he got paid) but he gets flattened by a truck after about 15 minutes.

But, if you've gotten past the film's title and cover art to this babble, you may be able to enjoy this thing.

And, while the zombies seem under represented (as in NOTLD), the zombies aren't supposed to be the stars, they simply provide the cause for the living, in a confined space, under stress, to reveal who they really are.  The character who really moves this story along is a very unlikable hard-as-they-come gangsta, who kills almost as many of the living as the zombies do.  However, his actions may also be what keeps this movie from being completely predictable. And you also probably won't be able to guess who's gonna die early, who's gonna last awhile or who, if anyone will survive.

  The Zombies: Your general run of the mill Romero zombies. A meteorite caused the outbreak when it collided with a flock of homeless(yes you heard me)... Rating of 3.

  The S.F.X: There are two fantastic SFX scenes on two different deaths... I was amazed for the second. For suck a low budget movie this was pretty damn cool!!! Rating of 3.5.

  The Story: Cops going for a drug bust, two rival gangs(stereotypical Latino and Black gangs) collied... Zombies then mess up the party etc... Rating of 2.5.

  The Acting: For the most part the cast was fairly descent, another shocking developement. A few may have over did it... Rating of 3.

The zombies start to infect other people they encounter and end up trapping a couple of dueling gangs in a warehouse. One gang has three black members and the other gang is a hispanic gang and its safe to say that neither one of these gangs like each other. While trapped in the warehouse the two rival gangs fight for control over the other while a couple of cops are trapped with them. Reggie Bannister from the Phantasm movies makes an appearance. This movie gets really good while the in-fighting continues and the zombies continue to spread their plague all around the area outside the warehouse.

2762359,2,B000NA1W4K,"I have to give the film makers credit with ""Gangs of the Dead"". Whatever the budget was for this flick, they used every penny of it in the production. The special effects were pretty decent for a low budget flick, the director did some interesting things with the lighting to add suspense during certain scenes, and the acting wasn't bad either. They even sprung for genre horror favorite Reggie Bannister to make a cameo.

On the down side, ""Gangs of the Dead"" is simply boring and a retread of multiple zombie flicks, only this time we get an urban setting. When a meteorite crashes into a group of bums it turns them into a ravenous pack of flesh eating zombies. In another part of the city, two rival gangs come to a run down warehouse in order to buy some weapons. The police are also on the scene in order to arrest the gangs and the arms dealer. Well before long the hungry zombies trap the gangs and some of the police officers in the warehouse, then it becomes a fight for survival.

While the film makers did several things right, they did so many other things wrong. First, there are no likable characters. Who are we supposed to root for here? The gangbangers? Both gangs are filled with unlikable characters, and at times you will actually root for the living dead to begin feasting on these dimwitted wanna-be tough guys. The police? While I did get a chuckle out of seeing the LAPD attacking zombies with their nightsticks (in similar fashion to what we've all witnessed on so many news broadcasts) the police here are amazingly stupid and again you actually hope the zombies will form a buffet line. There is also a cowardly, nerdy wealthy white-guy weather man thrown into the mix which you can't care about either.

Another problem I had with the film is that in the opening segments, when you first meet the ""heros"" of the film, they are cruising around town blasting some music...which is fine...except that any dialog uttered is buried under the music. They stop to pick up some girl...who is she? I don't know as the entire scene the is buried under the music. It's only quite a bit later in the film that we learn she is one of the gangbangers sisters.

Independent moviemakers, not to mention minority movie makers had it a lot tougher before phone cameras and streaming. I think it made them more creative though. The only thing I don't like is that my favorite character dies. I'll avoid a spoiler by not saying who it is but I wanted to see him in a sequel. Other than that, for me, it is with the money to own this movie. Fun to watch anytime or with friends. I wish they'd do an edit without saying f*#k every other word because it's a good movie for kids. More fun than scary.",1456963200,,730,4.2214285714285715
