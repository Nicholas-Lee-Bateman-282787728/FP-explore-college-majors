7989628,5,B000095J2L,"This movie is for anyone who is an Old-School anime fan. I've seen it when it was on the Starz Movie network years ago and it's awesome that I've gotten this to add to my obscured anime collection. It's not even on YouTube from what I know and I bet it's not too easy to find, I could be wrong. If you want to have a feel of nostalgia for anime, this is one of the best.",1395273600,2,370,3.8181818181818183
7989629,5,B000095J2L,"classic, original, stylish, AND THE GUY WHO DID THE VOICE ACTING OF GUTS FROM BERSERK is in this.
Wow. great characters, sad story, and wonderful times with this. awesome awesome awesome!",1363132800,,187,5.064516129032258
7989630,4,B000095J2L,"Anyone who enjoys stuff like Kull or Conan will probably enjoy this movie.  I grew up on those old-style sword, sandal, and sorcery fantasies, and still enjoy them, so I liked this movie.  If you're into steampunk, mil style fantasy, or other modern genres and don't like the older stuff, you'd probably do better to stay away.

I got this on sale, and am pleased with it for the most part.  The menus have some programming issues that might be player-dependent, but the feature plays fine.",1324425600,5,490,4.662790697674419
7989631,5,B000095J2L,"This movie is definitely my favorite anime movie, possibly my favorite movie altogether, and I am a person who usually doesn't have favorites. I enjoyed this movie because of the fairy tale quality of the story and the beautiful artwork. When I first watched it I decided I had to have it. I would like to find out a little more about the characters and feel more would appreciate the film if they understood it was part of a series to light novels. However, I enjoyed it without any background information at all.  I adore this movie and have watched it many, many times since I received it as a gift.",1317686400,2,602,4.423423423423423
7989632,1,B000095J2L,"I would consider myself the type of anime fan who easily likes anime, but this is the first anime movie I've ever been disappointed with. Here we have a cool swordsman who just stands there, a mage who never gets a chance to cast any spells, and a little girl who's tossed in for no apparent reason. There's virtually no character development. The movie focuses too much on the mysterious city these travelers enter. It was ok to watch for the first time, but there's zero re-watch value. I was so disappointed that I sold this DVD on eBay after viewing, and I had a difficult time doing so since it seemed no one wanted it. If you still insist on viewing this movie - RENT IT.",1128902400,6,677,4.338582677165355
7989633,4,B000095J2L,"Well, yes, the movie was too short for my liking, but the animation was definately good.  The characters weren't given a proper introduction.  The reason behind it is simple and understandable though.  It was made as an insert to a manga series.  I haven't read the manga series, but I'd like to.  Tieh's spells were awesome to watch being preformed, Bois and Lakeshi's fighting scenes were cool, and learning about Lakeshi's past and disturbing(for her) memories was interesting.  Although the movie was short, it wasn't completely non-understandable.  Another review said that you finally understand it about 50mins in and 2secs later it's over.  Well, it's true, but it didn't take away from anything.  It's better if you don't try to think about what you'd like to know during the movie(save it for when it's over) and focus on just what's in the story.  Focus on the story they give you about Azec Sistra.
In short, this was an interesting and thought-provoking anime movie.  For some more information, you can view this site.

Enjoy the movie!",1080604800,11,1054,4.931818181818182
7989634,1,B000095J2L,"The story of this Anime is so contrived that you are just beginning to try and figure it out around the 50 minute mark.  The only problem is - it's over 2 seconds later!!!
Save yourself the (almost) hour, and skip this boring excuse for a movie.",1064361600,3,245,4.212765957446808
