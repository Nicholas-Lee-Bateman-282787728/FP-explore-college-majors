3058171,5,B00111YM56,"Yeah, do not judge this one by its cover. Usually a cover is there to oversell the movie inside, but for some reason this one seems designed to do the opposite - it makes a clever and sometimes genuinely shocking thriller look like piece of cynical no budget rubbish. A great movie that I began watching with low expectations then became increasingly transfixed by. How rarely I get this kind of surprise.

p.s. The person saying this movie copied Rogue is wrong, they were made roughly at the same time.",1207008000,8,504,4.6
3058172,4,B00111YM56,"...Crocodile blues, won't you keep on snapping. Now this is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your tree. Three vacationers go fishing in an Australian mangrove swamp unaware that they're about to become croc food. Simple enough, but what I loved about this movie is that you rooted for the people, not the water dragon. The mother-to-be, her husband, and her sister were all solid characters.

Tense music and mood substitute superbly for the reptile's appearance throughout the film, which is used sparingly. There are no crappy CGI effects, just footage of real saltwater crocodilians ingeniously spliced in. I also love the upbeat beginning, which plays a neat song called Don't Walk Alone while happy photos of each character set things up.

To be fair to the creature, however, the abuse of these scaly giants by man is explained at the outset as these people discuss croc handbags, aphrodisiacs, and other uses for the stalking snappers. So when the toothy beast turns the tables later on, its revenge is understandable AND tragic.

This is not for Lake Placid laugh-out-loud cheeky monkeys! I recommend this for those who like their horror and suspense straight, without any humor.",1207008000,5,1192,4.9798994974874375
3058173,4,B00111YM56,"Comparisons to another Australian low-budget horror film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water/dp/B00064AE0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water</a>, are inevitable--and apt. And, having mentioned ""Open Water,"" I should add that I thought it a brilliant film. Thus, this review should be interpreted in light of that statement.

Three twenty-somethings are on their summer holiday shortly after Christmas. They decide to take a fishing trip and engage a small boat and tour guide. While they are anchored in a mangrove swamp, a killer crocodile upsets the boat and dispatches the guide. This leaves the three vacationers to fend for themselves. Most of the time, they do so by sitting in the mangrove trees, which allow them safety from the crocodile if not comfort or a path to rescue.

As I noted, comparisons to ""Open Water"" are inevitable. Here are just a few:
1. The casts are mostly unknown to American audiences but do an admirable job.
2. The films rely heavily on an inability to see the animals (sharks and the crocodile), building suspense through what are often simply shots of water.
3. Both films begin with a short attempt to get us to know the characters, but these attempts are not enough; we only get to know the characters well once they are in serious trouble.
4. There is little gore or overt violence in either film.
5. Both films were made on small budgets.

There are other similarities, of course, but I don't want to belabor the point. In the end, I thought ""Black Water"" was a solid movie, but it tended a few times a bit much toward predictability for my tastes.",1203552000,7,1641,5.138576779026217

But it did have some thrilling moments, which, when they came were worthwhile. I can't imagine being in their position, and the quieter moments of the film showed the angst and the divided emotion of what it feels like to be trapped with no other alternative but to wait in the trees forever or go back into the dark, murky water.  THAT was the real moment of the film:  Choosing between the psychological suffering of knowing that either decision might be deadly. What would you do?",1484697600,4,625,4.603603603603603

Set in some Australian mangrove swamp four explorers (a husband and wife and the wifes younger sister and the guide) are beset by a rarely seen croc. This croc is no terrifying behemoth such as the one found in Rogue or Primeval but a generally large though within range crocodile who seems to have a particular like for stalking humans. The guide is fairly quickly dispatched and the tourists are then stuck above the water in a maze of mangroves often too terrified to chance turning the boat back over. Like the couple in Open Water this group realizes that their hope for being rescued is a pretty thin one, if non-existent, and that they're likely to die of starvation or falling prey to the croc or some other pest long before being found. The women find reserves of inner strength but not before members of the group make some believable but foolish decisions. This is one movie where there may not be a happy end.

I had to review Black Water, though! This movie was so intense. I normally multitask while watching a movie. NOT with this movie. I was glued to the screen, just could not look away. That it was based on a true story caused me to be very invested (desperately so) in the survival of the characters. It was also very well acted, well written, and well paced, heightening the suspense to an impressive level.

I felt that some things that happened couldn't have been part of the true story, but I also understood that it was a movie ""based"" on a true story and not a straight-up retelling of facts. So I assume they took liberties with the story to make it more entertaining. It would be interesting to learn more about the actual event.

3058332,4,B00111YM56,"Many of the reviews here claim the movie is unrealistic.  Now I am no crocodile expert, but if crocs behave similar to alligators, I will have to respectfully disagree.  In addition to their body strength, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, gators are one of the most cunning, sneaky animals I have ever encountered.  If they have you in their sights, they can be very methodical.

Years ago, a friend and I fished the banks of a fresh water pond about a half mile inland on Hilton Head Island in SC for several days.  Near the end of the first day, we noticed the pond was home to a 7 foot gator.  Although a little shaken, the fishing was good; so, we decided to accept the risk and stay.  At first, we were very mindful of the gator; however, as time passed we became less so.  The gator seemed oblivious to us.  As far as we could tell, he never came within 15 yards.  This went on for a few days.  Then, on our last day, things changed.  The gator crawled onto the bank about 20 yards down from us.  He sat there awhile and then gently returned into the water.  Since the gator had done this numerous times over the previous days, we thought little of it and continued fishing.  About 15 minutes later the gator gave us the scare of a lifetime.  We were sitting with our poles in hand a few feet from the shoreline and about a yard apart.  Suddenly and without warning, the gator emerged at the shoreline and quickly crawled onto the bank between my friend and I.  Survival instincts took over as we dropped everything and made a narrow escape.

They are definitely some sneaky SOBs!",1481673600,2,1584,4.363013698630137

3058375,3,B00111YM56,"Black Water is not a very realistic crocodile behaviour wise film at all, just because it was mostly shot in a tree in some mangroves in the suburbs of Sydney and is low budget, does not make it any more realistic than a CGI creature film tormenting various scantly clad teens stupid enough to ignore the warnings around a summer camp or something. Granted the premise for this is more realistic than those sort of storylines though, a couple and the wife's younger sister on a road trip vacation decide to try a small fishing tour company they read about in a backpacker guidebook. By not ringing ahead to find out any details they arrive to find the tour left five minutes ago. But some other guy on the isolated property offers to take them out to see the mangroves and fish from a large tinnie (Australian slang for small metal boat). Obviously they eventually encounter a large territorial croc when they venture up a creek who overturns the tinnie and kills the guide. The couple scramble up to lower branches on a tree, the younger sister onto the upturned hull of the boat. The husband convinces them that the sensible option of waiting to be rescued won't happen and they must get back on the boat. Of course the territorial croc isn't having any of that.

Although the situation may be realistic the croc's behaviour isn't (and you could also argue neither is the humans' but I guess stress makes people do stupid things so you can live with that). Some spoilers in the following. Crocs can jump pretty high, this one easily could have snatched anyone at any time yet we have a few of the Hollywood style foot just missing being grabbed by snapping jaws as the person gets pulled out of the water onto the tree and is safe. The croc also moves extremely slowly, if it was chasing someone on land, yes this would be the case but in water, the humans out pacing the croc to get to safety just shouts stupid Hollywood nonsense, assume the audience are idiots. The croc would have got anyone in the water in seconds. It most likely would have been waiting patiently submerged ready to launch itself as soon as one of them was stupid enough to get near or in the water. The poor writing also has these humans once in the water, procrastinate for at least ten seconds before deciding to move. Their only hope was the croc wasn't close by or was asleep, as soon as they touch the water it knows exactly where they are, if they were going to try for the boat, they had to make that action sudden and quick.

Why they didn't just wait to be rescued seems hard to believe though. The husband makes the argument that no one knows where they are, well the original tour they missed guide would return to the house with his tourists, see a strange car with NSW numberplates there, notice the other guide (or whatever his real job there was) wasn't there either and that the tinnie was missing. When they didn't return by nightfall he would have at least set out himself but more likely alerted authorities who would have started a search. There's also other odd parts of the plot that don't make sense, the couple try and pull the sister by rope on the hull to get the boat, but when there are three of them in the tree, greater strength pulling a lighter weight, they don't even attempt to pull the, in the in their minds only solution to surviving, boat in.

Then you've got the normal Hollywood nonsense of the croc taunting his human victims such as the two girls are in the water and it just floats up to the top of the water in front of them, or it is behind one on a sand bank and is just waiting for her to turn around so it can open its mouth and scare her. You've also got the Paul Hogan joke from his film Crocodile Dundee that he told to the gullible American city journalist that crocs store food (as in bodies) in trees, caves and the like (in this film's case it's a sandbank) that plays a huge part in the plot.

The film mostly uses footage of real crocodiles on a blue screen behind the actors. This of course makes the crocs more realistic looking than CGI ones but for some reason they didn't go with just the one croc, or even crocs that looked pretty similar, it is obvious these are different crocodiles, some even vary dramatically in size. The actors are all unknown (even for me an Australian), with the exception of the guide Ben Oxenbould who was in the later seasons of Hey Dad a few decades earlier. They do however do a good job, although as mentioned they are following a poorly written script.

A very similar plot film involving a killing group of tourists croc also came out in 2007 and was much better than this one, called Rogue. Black Water is worth watching once if you can live with the unrealistic croc behaviour, but if you're only going to watch one I'd go with Rogue instead.",1420761600,2,4816,4.412823397075366

Here, there's no CGI, the characters don't posses super powers, no out of no where cavalry coming so save the day. It's a very real, gritty look at what could happen to anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time, very much like Wolf Creek.

Based on a real life crocodile attack, it tells the story of a man, his wife, and her sister on an outing with a guide in the backwaters of Australia. Their short, happy trip turns ugly very quickly and they are stalked by a huge salt water crocodile.

It may not sound plausible, but the filmmakers do a very credible job making it seems as if it could happen exactly as it does here. I'm sure there are major deviations from the story on which this film is based, and I don't really care how much it does deviate, because this movie is just fine as is.

There's nothing mystical, magical, or supernatural about this movie. Believe me, just the thought of a hungry, territorial ""salty"" is more than enough fright for anyone's taste. It has some of the best suspense I've seen in many years. No false steps in this movie for me.

There are 3 main characters in the movie not including the one who you will see for less than a minute and another for a few short minutes. That said, there aren't many people in the movie, so it's really just 3 people and a crocodile. Of all 5 characters I liked none. 2 were O.K. One of them was the pregnant woman and another was the person who swam on his boat with them. After approximately 11-12 minutes of the movie, you will be left to unrealistical crocodile and its unrealistical behavior and one character who is all right and others who I couldn't care less about. At the very end, when you see the croc for the last time I felt really sad for what happened to it. It was cruel to see what they did to a poor croc in the movie and yet showing his eyes, which were showing his last seconds of life. As you look in the eyes, you can see that he didn't understand what happened. I don't understand how the movie can have good ratings. 90% of the movie, you will see characters sitting on the tree. For several times you will hear characters arguing over the same things, over and over again. How many times did they talk about no other boats nearby or that the husband of the pregnant woman had any other plans other than what he mentioned sadly not once? Bad movie, not recommended and therefore also could care less about acting, because it just doesn't matter. Not thrilling and definitely not scary.",1372982400,,1587,4.322147651006712

If you're going fishing in crocodile waters, heed that warning.  Based on a true story, what started as a vacation fishing trip with a guide ends up a monster croc story of terror.  A father, mother, and their twenty-two year old daughter have been travelling around in their Australian outback looking for things to do.  When they select a remote swamp fishing excursion, they get more than they bargained for.  The area is similar to the Everglades in Florida, and just as dangerous.  Areas like this around the world are filled with deadly snakes and gators or crocs.  In Australia the crocodiles get as large as thirty feet.  This family unfortunately finds out that they can overturn a small fishing boat.  When a croc overturns their boat they must try to figure out how to survive or die a horrible death.  I recommend this movie if you enjoy scary creatures stories.  This is not for small children!

3058425,3,B00111YM56,"I found myself laughing at the characters' dialogue. Some of it feels passable for a survival situation of this kind, but other times, it felt fake.

The writers seemed to be going for delirium when they had one character recite the teasing mister crocodile children's rhyme. Another character later on in the movie spouts off the lines, too. The actors should be commended for their performances, though, even if the writing feels unrealistic. And for an hour and a half movie about three characters getting trapped in a tree by a crocodile, it feels like most of the dialogue is only there to pad the length and build suspense.

So by the end of it, to be honest I didn't really care about the shallow and dully written characters. So what makes this movie a 3 star film and ultimately, worth watching?

The crocodile. He's really the main star of the cast here, and he's the real McCoy. As far as I know, there is very little CGI. Most of the shots are of a real crocodile. The only minor problem is that they obviously used a variety of crocodile footage: the crocodile looks much smaller in some shots than in others.

But other than that lack of consistency, the crocodile managed to terrify me, especially towards the end of the movie when the tension reaches a fever pitch.

On the whole, I feel like this film is slightly overrated. The lack of consistency with the crocodile sizes, the shallow characters, and the lack of extremely suspenseful scenes until the very end all contribute to this. But if you're in the mood for a man-eating animal movie with some decent suspense and a satisfying conclusion, I can heartily recommend Black Water.",1354752000,,1652,4.6632302405498285

Extremely well done, low-budget film that has great direction, acting and subject going for it. Crocodile footage is seamlessly sewn into the scenes requiring actor interaction.
This has more of a dreadful feel to it as opposed to big budget films because this is played as a real situation as opposed to a hollywood script of the 'Jaws' caliber but this film is just as effective if not more so because of the deliberate 'reality' that's been produced.

Soon, however, they get more than they barganined for when an enormous croc flips their boat, kills their tour guide, and traps them up in a tree. What really seperates this movie from so many others is the story is convincing. As someone who has read extensively about crocidiles, I can tell you that everything the croc does in this movie can be done by crocs in the wild. Now perhaps not all at once as the movie depicts, but just about every specific action can be done. Another thing is the acting. The acting in this movie is by far the best acting I have seen in any movie (much less a horror one) in a long, long time. You can literally feel the terror of the characters. In addition, the croc is the most realistic looking movie monster in a long time, as it should since they used real crocs for many of the scenes. I can't praise this movie enough. Buy it, watch it.

In this film a married couple and the wife's sister go out on a fishing trip in a rather small boat and while finishing the boat is over turned and the family get to a tree, unfortunately the guide that took them out wasn't as lucky.
From here on you have a great thriller as the hungry Croc terrorizes and stalks the family as they try and devise ways to make their escape.
The water is so dark and murky that it makes it all the more creepy and scary because we know there is something down there but where and when it will pop up is another story.

3058433,4,B00111YM56,"2007's ""Black Water"" is an Australian crocagator flick made for only $700,000, which shows you can make a quality movie on a very low budget. Not that ""Black Water"" is anything especially amazing, but it is the most realistic crocagator flick I've ever seen (although I haven't yet seen the acclaimed ""Rogue,"" another Australian croc film from 2007).

PLOT: While on vacation, a man, his wife, her sister and a guide go fishing in a mangrove swamp in northern Australian where they get attacked by a croc, who is hardly ever seen in the muddy waters. They find temporary sanctuary in the trees but know they'll die of thirst if they don't make an effort to escape the remote swamp. But how?

The story is said to be based on true events, which I don't doubt since the film smacks of near total realism. This of course sets it apart from most crocagator flicks, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alligator/dp/B000SQFBZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alligator</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crocodile/dp/B00004YS98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crocodile</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Placid-2-Unrated/dp/B000WTVZGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Placid 2 (Unrated)</a>"" which have too much goofiness to take very seriously. While I enjoy those movies, especially ""Crocodile,"" I always prefer realism if given the choice.

The plot is in some ways reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Skies-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000KF0GT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Skies (Widescreen Edition)</a>"", also from 2007, just substitute the croc for aliens.

Aside from the totally realistic vibe, ""Black Water"" has solid no-name actors in the main roles, particularly the two sisters played by Diana Glenn (Grace) and Maeve Dermody (Lee). Not only are they worthy actors but they're appealing in a girl-next-door type of way.

The only negative I can cite is the thin plot. The story as detailed above is the WHOLE movie. As a result, there's quite a bit of down time, particularly as the survivors mark time in the trees trying to figure out how to escape.

For this reason the film would have probably worked better at the hour mark. As it is, it's 89 minutes with credits and some parts are really sssllllooooooww[...] But the film makes up for it in realism. What would YOU do if you and your loved ones were attacked and cornered by a huge croc in an isolated swamp in the middle of nowhere?

I'm giving ""Black Water"" 4 Stars with reservations: If you're in the mood for a relatively fast-paced, partly goofy, horror thrill-ride, look elsewhere. If you want the awful truth, including many long sequences of heart-wrenching uncertainty and horror, check out ""Black Water.""

3058436,5,B00111YM56,"I have a wierd fear of alligators/crocodiles. Living in Florida you pretty much are used to an alligator being in any body of water, Ive even knowingly swam in lakes that have them. I can hold baby ones, touch adults who have taped mouths of course. My fear only manifests itself in my nightmares where I am pursued by one, or many, and dragged underwater. I know thats just symbolism, but its sure as heck feels like a reptilian nightmare.

This film inhabits those nightmares, and I was crazy in the head to watch it...but I still did! Black Water is an Australian film, based on a true story. The real story involved 3 teens who went for a bike ride by a river and there was a flash flood, the teen boy got pulled under by a crocodile and the other two, both girls,  climbed a tree. The Croc paraded the body past the girls all night, and then stuck around so they couldn't get down, they were finally rescued and the boys' body was never recovered.

In Black Water the characters are also two women who are sisters and the oldest sister's husband. They take a vacation, and ironically go to a crocodile farm. The saltwater croc or ""saltie"" is the largest living reptile. The Australian Saltwater Crocodile population is estimated at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 adults, and its not uncommon to find one measuring in at 19 feet. Most of the farms were opened up by hunters who were capturing a record amount of crocs, and now using them for products (meat, purses, belts, etc) and the tourism aspect brought even more money in. Now they are breeding farms, and no wild crocodiles are brought in, so its turned into a conservation movement as well as an entertainment industry. I bring this up, because now there are fewer hunters and more crocodiles in the wild, and that's where this film comes in.

These three go from the farm, where they observed how crocs can jump out of the water to grab prey, and just how powerful they are in pursuit of a meal, to going fishing down into the mangroves off a main river. While fishing, a crocodile turns over their boat and kills their guide immediately, and they must now find a way to survive its hunt. I love horror movies that take place in one distinct area, in this case a little plot of water, some trees, and a boat. They actually filmed in a real mangrove, with real crocodiles, none of that CGI nonsense that's hardly believable. I had to keep telling myself to breathe at points, and that it was only a movie.

I only have one complaint, and that's the cover of the DVD, don't go by how terrible that is, the Australian release had a better one than the Americanized version.",1298246400,2,2640,4.48024948024948
3058437,5,B00111YM56,"Courtesy of Fear. Net, I sat down to watch this movie with the intent of seeing something light and completely not of the stellar quality. However, within the first fifteen minutes--where barely anything happens in the film--I was pleasantly surprised and settled in for what I believed would be a good film.

Let me tell you, I was not disappointed.

BLACK WATER is about a small group of Australians away on a holiday. After visiting with family and going to the famed crocodile park, Mark, the leading man in this story, decides that he wants to go for some light fishing, but when they discover that they're unable to go they're disheartened and more than willing to abandon the trip--that is, until Jim, another caretaker, offers to take them.

Things seem to be going well immediately. They're getting a few bites, they're having a great time--

Then, out of nowhere, their boat is capsized, their captain killed by a giant crocodile, and they are left to survive, alone, in the Australian outback, with nothing more than a bottle of bug spray, a dead cell phone and a pocket knife.

BLACK WATER is your usual, straight-forward creature-feature film--it features a small group of people who are suddenly thrust into a situation that they cannot control. Miles away from civilization and in a channel hardly-navigated by boat traffic, there seems to be little hope from the get go. This sense of hopelessness is conveyed not only by surprisingly-talented actors, but by an amazing score that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Tension flows and ebbs in wicked tones as the score first rises, then falls in between crocodile sightings. However, this film would be nothing without the amazing actresses who are thankfully focused upon throughout much of the film. Both the women who played Gracie and Lee did an amazing job and set up an amazing chemistry that only further served to complete this film.

Do I have anything bad to say about this movie? Not really. I could have hoped for a more definite ending, but that might just be the fan of heroism in me that makes me desire that. However, that DOES NOT, in the least, detract from this movie.

As of this posting, BLACK WATER can be seen for free on Fear. Net, and for the amount of fun and tension I had whilst watching this film, I would recommend any and everyone who reads this review to seek this film out. Filled with tension up until the very last minute, BLACK WATER is an edge-of-your-seat creature feature with an all-star cast, a beautiful score and a very realistic sense of dread.

3058439,4,B00111YM56,"Opening with a montage of candid vacation photos, Black Water (2007) is a film that unpretentiously tells a story about ordinary people, unexpectedly facing danger.  Supposedly based on real events in Australia, the tale is simple, but quite effectively told, as a party of tourists is attacked by a crocodile, while on a fishing tour.  The survivors experience fear, doubt, confusion, and despair, as the deadly crocodile seems to show up at exactly the wrong time.

Grace (Diana Glenn), her boyfriend Adam (Andy Rodoreda), and her sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) are on vacation together.  With no definite plans, they decide to take a fishing tour on the river.  Boarding a small boat, Jim (Ben Oxenbould) their tour guide takes them out on the river.  While stopped in shallow water, the boat is flipped over by a croc, spilling the group into the water.  Grace and Adam make for a tree, while Lee tangled in some ropes is trapped beneath the capsized boat.  Unfortunately, Jim has become a snack for one of nature's more efficient killing machines.  Eventually, Lee makes her way to the tree, leaving the three survivors stuck up on the branches, looking down into the murky water, with the overturned boat floating few feet away, wondering what they should do.

To say much more, would spoil it for those who haven't seen the film.  With much of the action centered around a boat and a small group of trees, Black Water still holds your interest, and seems to have a high believability factor.  The crocodile is very persistent, and a couple of times gets a bit too frisky, but mostly the creature's behavior seems credible.  The actions of the survivors, seems logical and believable as well.  Their thinking process is clear, and things play out in a very natural and realistic way.  Early on an element is introduced that becomes a crucial factor later, but to story's credit, it takes some effort and intelligence to play this last card.

Black Water is co-written and co-directed by Andrew Traucki, and David Nerlich.  The pair provide an informative commentary track, with some interesting background information.  The cast and crew worked under some very challenging conditions on location.  Actors Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda, and Maeve Dermody are all very good, with Dermody delivering a very credible, and surprisingly gutsy performance.

Black Water is unspectacular and has a slow pace, but is a solidly effective thriller, with some surprises.

A pregnant girl, her bf and the pregnant girls younger sister along with a guide go on a fishing trip in the back waters of northern Australia where they soon meet up with a fiesty and very hungry crocodile.

Let's talk about this crocodile for a moment.  With its pronounced furrows above its eyes it resembles Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes.  If only it would eat Andy Rooney (sigh).

Once they arrive in a tributary called the mangroves, they are immediately up close and personal with the croc who tips over their dinky rowboat and chows down on the guide. The couple scramble out of the water and make it to a tree.  The younger sister is trapped under the boat but she soon pulls herself onto the capsized dinky rowboat.

The croc has finished his guide snack and is now circling the dinky rowboat looking for dessert.

The only gross-out scene involves sound rather than visuals.  The croc has risen to just below the surface of the water, victim firmly clenched in its jaws and offscreen all you hear is the sound of chewing and bone crunching. A great example of imagining besting outright blood and guts.

The balance of the movie is the fate of the trio in the tree.  Will they live? Will they die? Who will survive or can they survive?

The movie is intense and mind numbingly terrifying.

Good movie, not a great movie but well worth a watch and the moral of the story is--If you ever go fishing in the back waters of Australia, watch out for a crocodile with Andy Rooney eyes.",1278288000,2,1608,4.337792642140468

No one is likely to come where they are stranded. And somewhere in the muddy water a huge crocodile is hiding, waiting for the chance to eat them one by one.

""Black Water"" is a solid B-suspense movie. Unlike other killer animal thrillers like ""Alligator"" (1980), ""Black Water"" employs a more realistic approach to tell the story of three hapless travelers and one deadly croc, cleverly using the swamp as the backdrop. Obviously this Australian film was shot with a minimal budget, but the film's atmospheric photography is impressive enough to make us believe the presence of the lurking danger. Sometimes cheap special effects ruin the film in this kind of low budget suspense films, but this doesn't happen in ""Black Water.""

The film claims it is ""based on true events"" (I don't know anything about the events the film refers to), but actually the storyline of ""Black Water"" is pretty familiar to the fans of the genre. Don't get me wrong. This is not to say the film is bad. The acting is very good, and the film's direction is steady and solid, but honestly, the story after the first croc attack is not very surprising.

Black Water is a movie about a group of friends who go out into the water one day with a tour guide to go fishing. After leaving from their mother's house two sisters and one's boyfriend head out for a road trip. After visiting a croc farm they decide it is time to go fishing, doesn't seem like the right move right? So after getting a guide to take them out they spend an uneventful day out on the water that is until the boat rocks. Turns out a very big croc was waiting underneath them and pushed the boat over. That was the last time the guide was seen, and the other three make their way up a tree. From here on out the movie is all about these three in the tree and the croc below.

I remember watching this the first time and thinking here we go another nature run amuck flick that is supposedly based on true events. To my surprise this movie turned out to be good, much better than I expected. From what I can gather this is based on true events from a group of friends that were swimming or something and one got pulled underneath and was gone while the other two made it up a tree. Whether this is true or not it is still an effective and entertaining flick that all should enjoy. I personally like to think that this is based on some truth that is real close to this event. Don't get me wrong I don't like that people got ate alive but knowing that this is true adds a little something to it.

This movie is far from the best thing ever made but it is an effective enough film on the level that it does have a bit on tension to it. I like that the filmmakers stuck to the less is more rule and only showed the croc when necessary. I especially like when the camera just looks to the water and nothing ever appears, then right when you are getting the feeling ever thing is ok just the top of the croc's head appears right in front of someone. Writer/directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki did a great job in my opinion on this indie flick about a killer croc.

As far as performances go they only add to the tension since the small cast all do great jobs. The guys are good in this the boyfriend goes from a geeky looking dude to trying to be the hero, it doesn't work out. But it is the actresses that play the two sisters that steal the show from the boys in this one; the younger one in particular is great. Add in the atmosphere of the film and you have an enjoyable little killer croc flick there are more enjoyable films on this subject if you want gore or even comedy elements in croc/alligator flicks. But if you want a cool indie flick with a good amount of tension, I liked it.

Rogue is slightly better on a technical level, and is a reccommended watch, but overall I thought Black Water was the better movie.

  The plot is basic but the crocodile is a formidable prescence (bolstered by impressive special effects) and the interactions (and sometimes tensions) among the human characters are well done and convincing.  Probably the most notable thing about Black Water is the very thing that, in mentioning it, has the potential to turn a lot of people off it: the croc attack comes early, and the surviving characters proceed to spend a large portion of the movie trapped up in the trees that dot the mangrove.  Now, I realize that sounds like it's going to be stupid, but it says something that the movie actually pulled it off.  The trees are sparse, and as the characters try to manuever from one to the other to make it to land, or clash over whether to brave the shallow, still waters and try and reach their capsized boat, or try to scramble higher up the trees and out of potential reach of the croc's jaws, the movie doesn't drag one bit.  I thought it was worth some kudos that while some movies have all kinds of interesting twists and subplots but can't always make them click, Black Water takes a very bare-bones scenario and keeps it fresh and engaging.  Of course, eventually, the movie does move on as the boaters's fight for survival gets increasingly desperate.  Like a lot of the other killer reptile films, Black Water doesn't really have a villain, per se: the crocodile is hungry, not evil.

I don't think the Jaws comparisons carry much weight, and -as far as the other film comparisons go - who cares?  Even if you've never seen a movie before in your life, you pretty much know how the film is going to play out by the twenty-five minute mark - and that doesn't make the film any less thrilling or suspenseful.  The only question that really matters here is who, if any, of the characters are going to survive.  The plot is one of brutal simplicity - and I mean that as a compliment.

Here's the situation.  You're enjoying a fishing adventure with two family members in a mangrove swamp in Northern Australia when your boat is capsized by a salt-water crocodile.  Two of you manage to scurry up a nearby tree, while the most vulnerable member of your party clings to the top of the overturned boat.  Forget about your tour guide because he doesn't survive the initial attack.  The odds are that no one is going to be looking for you any time soon, and there are hundreds of little tributaries to search if someone does come.  Your best bet is the boat, but - assuming you can first rescue the third member of your party, there's no way to get to the boat without venturing dozens of terrifying meters into the water.  That water, by the way, isn't black but it is definitely dark (I imagine they would have called this movie Dark Water if that title hadn't already been taken so recently) - unless the crocodile shows himself, there's almost no way you're going to know he's coming until he's torn into you with his massive jaws.  What do you do?

I love and respect crocodiles.  They are second only to sharks in the list of nature's most brilliantly designed killing machines.  As unfortunate as the characters' situation is, I can't hate or condemn this salty for doing what he was born to do.  That being said, this particular croc is a mean one; I don't want to give anything away, so just take my word on this.  The big guy's in total control of the situation, and he knows it - and he has all the time in the world to wait for his victims to make a deadly mistake.  You're not looking at some kind of CGI creation or mechanical beast here, either; Black Water serves us the real deal.  Some people, of course, complain that the crocodile does not get enough screen time, but any fan of classic horror can tell you that less is more in situations like this.  Maybe the ending doesn't ring quite true, but overall I found this film disquietingly realistic.

Perhaps the most horrifying thing of all about this film is the fact that it was inspired in part by actual events.  Salt water crocs kill several people a year in Northern Australia, but most of those deaths involve humans doing something they shouldn't be doing.  Here, as in the case that inspired the movie, you simply have a case of three individuals being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I realize I haven't mentioned any of the characters in this film.  We may not get to know them like old friends, but I thought there was definitely adequate characterization in play here - and I thought Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody, and Andy Rodoreda turned in inspired performances.  In fact, I'm going to throw out kudos all around, especially to co-writers and co-directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki.  I understand that this film had a low budget (as little as one million dollars), but I would never have guessed that for myself.  Black Water is an immensely excellent film.",1215820800,34,4337,5.119318181818182
3058451,4,B00111YM56,"I recently reviewed the awful Lake Placid 2 and now we have another moving about a menacing crocodile, Black Water.  Trust me however; the two films could not be more different in every way possible.  Black Water is a true, low-budget diamond in the rough.  In this case, low-budget doesn't mean any sacrifice in quality.  This Australian-produced film is somewhat reminiscent of 2003's Open Water in that it has a very small cast--only five actors are listed in the credits--and is shot in only a few different settings.  The fear in Black Water is largely psychological and comes from what you don't see as much as what you do see.

Set just after Christmas, two sisters Lee (Dermody) and Grace along with Grace's boyfriend, Adam, hire a boat to take them fishing and sightseeing along an Australian river.  The river waters are extremely high, creating a swamp out of the nearby forest.  As the trio cast their lines in the murky waters, their little boat is suddenly overturned by a crocodile who quickly munches their guide as they climb to safety up one of the trees.  Their boat lies overturned, just feet away but it may as well be a mile.  They find themselves completely trapped, surrounded by water and who knows how many crocodiles.

Directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki deftly build the suspense as each little splash; each ripple in the water sends a chill of fear through the three survivors.  Adam wants to go for the boat but the sisters want to wait until someone comes along, a prospect Adam insists is useless as know one knows they are even out there.  It becomes a test of nerves and resolve as they try to keep their footing in the tree as exhaustion and starvation assaults them, not to mention the constant biting of mosquitoes.

Unlike Lake Placid, this film doesn't use cheap CGI effects.  In an effort to bring the most realism to the production, they've used real crocodiles, combining them with the actors through blue screen photography which is seamless and often horrifyingly real.  Its real progenitor might be considered Jaws, as you don't see the crocodile a lot, particularly early on, although it does provide some of those signature jump-out-of-your-seat moments.  You knew the croc was always out there, lurking about but you never knew where.

The cast was superb because they were so completely real and believable.  There was not a hint of overacting.  Adam didn't try to be the typical macho hero and the girls weren't just helpless bimbos.  They all did an outstanding job of conveying the helplessness and desperation of their plight.  Nerves become frayed and tempers begin to flare.  I can honestly say I didn't know who, if any of them, would ever get out of the swamp.

The film was also shot on location in an actual mangrove swamp and provided the crew with only about a three hour window each day as the tide would go out leaving them in a muddy riverbed.  The scenery was beautifully shot and while it was made only a mile or so from Sydney, it strongly suggested a primeval remoteness.  This is one of those little hidden gems that you hope to find on a trip to the video store.  Definitely one to check out.

Extras

The extras included an audio commentary with both directors, a few deleted scenes and an excellent, 23 minute making of documentary featuring interviews with cast and crew.",1213574400,2,3351,4.719449225473322

The use of little known actors and real crocs adds to the sense of documentary in this ""based on actual events"" movie.

3292669,4,B00111YM56,"...Crocodile blues, won't you keep on snapping. Now this is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your tree. Three vacationers go fishing in an Australian mangrove swamp unaware that they're about to become croc food. Simple enough, but what I loved about this movie is that you rooted for the people, not the water dragon. The mother-to-be, her husband, and her sister were all solid characters.

Tense music and mood substitute superbly for the reptile's appearance throughout the film, which is used sparingly. There are no crappy CGI effects, just footage of real saltwater crocodilians ingeniously spliced in. I also love the upbeat beginning, which plays a neat song called Don't Walk Alone while happy photos of each character set things up.

To be fair to the creature, however, the abuse of these scaly giants by man is explained at the outset as these people discuss croc handbags, aphrodisiacs, and other uses for the stalking snappers. So when the toothy beast turns the tables later on, its revenge is understandable AND tragic.

This is not for Lake Placid laugh-out-loud cheeky monkeys! I recommend this for those who like their horror and suspense straight, without any humor.",1207008000,5,1192,4.9798994974874375
3292670,4,B00111YM56,"Comparisons to another Australian low-budget horror film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water/dp/B00064AE0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water</a>, are inevitable--and apt. And, having mentioned ""Open Water,"" I should add that I thought it a brilliant film. Thus, this review should be interpreted in light of that statement.

Three twenty-somethings are on their summer holiday shortly after Christmas. They decide to take a fishing trip and engage a small boat and tour guide. While they are anchored in a mangrove swamp, a killer crocodile upsets the boat and dispatches the guide. This leaves the three vacationers to fend for themselves. Most of the time, they do so by sitting in the mangrove trees, which allow them safety from the crocodile if not comfort or a path to rescue.

As I noted, comparisons to ""Open Water"" are inevitable. Here are just a few:
1. The casts are mostly unknown to American audiences but do an admirable job.
2. The films rely heavily on an inability to see the animals (sharks and the crocodile), building suspense through what are often simply shots of water.
3. Both films begin with a short attempt to get us to know the characters, but these attempts are not enough; we only get to know the characters well once they are in serious trouble.
4. There is little gore or overt violence in either film.
5. Both films were made on small budgets.

There are other similarities, of course, but I don't want to belabor the point. In the end, I thought ""Black Water"" was a solid movie, but it tended a few times a bit much toward predictability for my tastes.",1203552000,7,1641,5.138576779026217

Set in some Australian mangrove swamp four explorers (a husband and wife and the wifes younger sister and the guide) are beset by a rarely seen croc. This croc is no terrifying behemoth such as the one found in Rogue or Primeval but a generally large though within range crocodile who seems to have a particular like for stalking humans. The guide is fairly quickly dispatched and the tourists are then stuck above the water in a maze of mangroves often too terrified to chance turning the boat back over. Like the couple in Open Water this group realizes that their hope for being rescued is a pretty thin one, if non-existent, and that they're likely to die of starvation or falling prey to the croc or some other pest long before being found. The women find reserves of inner strength but not before members of the group make some believable but foolish decisions. This is one movie where there may not be a happy end.

Respect boundaries.  Not to say that Indigenous peoples don't get taken by crocs, but after 10,000 years of them LIVING VS. DESTROYING with them, who do you think your odds would be better with?

I had to review Black Water, though! This movie was so intense. I normally multitask while watching a movie. NOT with this movie. I was glued to the screen, just could not look away. That it was based on a true story caused me to be very invested (desperately so) in the survival of the characters. It was also very well acted, well written, and well paced, heightening the suspense to an impressive level.

I felt that some things that happened couldn't have been part of the true story, but I also understood that it was a movie ""based"" on a true story and not a straight-up retelling of facts. So I assume they took liberties with the story to make it more entertaining. It would be interesting to learn more about the actual event. Even without those parts that were a bit unbelievable, it would have been a terrifying situation in my opinion.

3292829,4,B00111YM56,"Many of the reviews here claim the movie is unrealistic.  Now I am no crocodile expert, but if crocs behave similar to alligators, I will have to respectfully disagree.  In addition to their body strength, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, gators are one of the most cunning, sneaky animals I have ever encountered.  If they have you in their sights, they can be very methodical.

Years ago, a friend and I fished the banks of a fresh water pond about a half mile inland on Hilton Head Island in SC for several days.  Near the end of the first day, we noticed the pond was home to a 7 foot gator.  Although a little shaken, the fishing was good; so, we decided to accept the risk and stay.  At first, we were very mindful of the gator; however, as time passed we became less so.  The gator seemed oblivious to us.  As far as we could tell, he never came within 15 yards.  This went on for a few days.  Then, on our last day, things changed.  The gator crawled onto the bank about 20 yards down from us.  He sat there awhile and then gently returned into the water.  Since the gator had done this numerous times over the previous days, we thought little of it and continued fishing.  About 15 minutes later the gator gave us the scare of a lifetime.  We were sitting with our poles in hand a few feet from the shoreline and about a yard apart.  Suddenly and without warning, the gator emerged at the shoreline and quickly crawled onto the bank between my friend and I.  Survival instincts took over as we dropped everything and made a narrow escape.

They are definitely some sneaky SOBs!",1481673600,2,1584,4.363013698630137

3292872,3,B00111YM56,"Black Water is not a very realistic crocodile behaviour wise film at all, just because it was mostly shot in a tree in some mangroves in the suburbs of Sydney and is low budget, does not make it any more realistic than a CGI creature film tormenting various scantly clad teens stupid enough to ignore the warnings around a summer camp or something. Granted the premise for this is more realistic than those sort of storylines though, a couple and the wife's younger sister on a road trip vacation decide to try a small fishing tour company they read about in a backpacker guidebook. By not ringing ahead to find out any details they arrive to find the tour left five minutes ago. But some other guy on the isolated property offers to take them out to see the mangroves and fish from a large tinnie (Australian slang for small metal boat). Obviously they eventually encounter a large territorial croc when they venture up a creek who overturns the tinnie and kills the guide. The couple scramble up to lower branches on a tree, the younger sister onto the upturned hull of the boat. The husband convinces them that the sensible option of waiting to be rescued won't happen and they must get back on the boat. Of course the territorial croc isn't having any of that.

Although the situation may be realistic the croc's behaviour isn't (and you could also argue neither is the humans' but I guess stress makes people do stupid things so you can live with that). Some spoilers in the following. Crocs can jump pretty high, this one easily could have snatched anyone at any time yet we have a few of the Hollywood style foot just missing being grabbed by snapping jaws as the person gets pulled out of the water onto the tree and is safe. The croc also moves extremely slowly, if it was chasing someone on land, yes this would be the case but in water, the humans out pacing the croc to get to safety just shouts stupid Hollywood nonsense, assume the audience are idiots. The croc would have got anyone in the water in seconds. It most likely would have been waiting patiently submerged ready to launch itself as soon as one of them was stupid enough to get near or in the water. The poor writing also has these humans once in the water, procrastinate for at least ten seconds before deciding to move. Their only hope was the croc wasn't close by or was asleep, as soon as they touch the water it knows exactly where they are, if they were going to try for the boat, they had to make that action sudden and quick.

Why they didn't just wait to be rescued seems hard to believe though. The husband makes the argument that no one knows where they are, well the original tour they missed guide would return to the house with his tourists, see a strange car with NSW numberplates there, notice the other guide (or whatever his real job there was) wasn't there either and that the tinnie was missing. When they didn't return by nightfall he would have at least set out himself but more likely alerted authorities who would have started a search. There's also other odd parts of the plot that don't make sense, the couple try and pull the sister by rope on the hull to get the boat, but when there are three of them in the tree, greater strength pulling a lighter weight, they don't even attempt to pull the, in the in their minds only solution to surviving, boat in.

Then you've got the normal Hollywood nonsense of the croc taunting his human victims such as the two girls are in the water and it just floats up to the top of the water in front of them, or it is behind one on a sand bank and is just waiting for her to turn around so it can open its mouth and scare her. You've also got the Paul Hogan joke from his film Crocodile Dundee that he told to the gullible American city journalist that crocs store food (as in bodies) in trees, caves and the like (in this film's case it's a sandbank) that plays a huge part in the plot.

The film mostly uses footage of real crocodiles on a blue screen behind the actors. This of course makes the crocs more realistic looking than CGI ones but for some reason they didn't go with just the one croc, or even crocs that looked pretty similar, it is obvious these are different crocodiles, some even vary dramatically in size. The actors are all unknown (even for me an Australian), with the exception of the guide Ben Oxenbould who was in the later seasons of Hey Dad a few decades earlier. They do however do a good job, although as mentioned they are following a poorly written script.

A very similar plot film involving a killing group of tourists croc also came out in 2007 and was much better than this one, called Rogue. Black Water is worth watching once if you can live with the unrealistic croc behaviour, but if you're only going to watch one I'd go with Rogue instead.",1420761600,2,4816,4.412823397075366

They stumble upon a fishing and river tour outfit and it all goes horribly wrong from there. This movie was directed by Greg Mclean, who's first outing, Wolf Creek, was one of the scariest films I've seen. Much in the same with Wolf Creek, Mclean tells the story without any of the typical Hollywood cliches. Here, there's no CGI, the characters don't posses super powers, no out of no where cavalry coming so save the day. It's a very real, gritty look at what could happen to anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time, very much like Wolf Creek. I'd really liked it, and deserves a much better cover than the one used by Amazon. This is no goofy SyFy crocodile movie.

3292893,4,B00111YM56,"While not a ""horror"" movie, this little gem from Australia is seriously suspenseful and quite scary. Based on a real life crocodile attack, it tells the story of a man, his wife, and her sister on an outing with a guide in the backwaters of Australia. Their short, happy trip turns ugly very quickly and they are stalked by a huge salt water crocodile.

It may not sound plausible, but the filmmakers do a very credible job making it seems as if it could happen exactly as it does here. I'm sure there are major deviations from the story on which this film is based, and I don't really care how much it does deviate, because this movie is just fine as is.

There's nothing mystical, magical, or supernatural about this movie. Believe me, just the thought of a hungry, territorial ""salty"" is more than enough fright for anyone's taste. It has some of the best suspense I've seen in many years. No false steps in this movie for me.

There are 3 main characters in the movie not including the one who you will see for less than a minute and another for a few short minutes. That said, there aren't many people in the movie, so it's really just 3 people and a crocodile. Of all 5 characters I liked none. 2 were O.K. One of them was the pregnant woman and another was the person who swam on his boat with them. After approximately 11-12 minutes of the movie, you will be left to unrealistical crocodile and its unrealistical behavior and one character who is all right and others who I couldn't care less about. At the very end, when you see the croc for the last time I felt really sad for what happened to it. It was cruel to see what they did to a poor croc in the movie and yet showing his eyes, which were showing his last seconds of life. As you look in the eyes, you can see that he didn't understand what happened. I don't understand how the movie can have good ratings. 90% of the movie, you will see characters sitting on the tree. For several times you will hear characters arguing over the same things, over and over again. How many times did they talk about no other boats nearby or that the husband of the pregnant woman had any other plans other than what he mentioned sadly not once? Bad movie, not recommended and therefore also could care less about acting, because it just doesn't matter. Not thrilling and definitely not scary.",1372982400,,1587,4.322147651006712

If you're going fishing in crocodile waters, heed that warning.  Based on a true story, what started as a vacation fishing trip with a guide ends up a monster croc story of terror.  A father, mother, and their twenty-two year old daughter have been travelling around in their Australian outback looking for things to do.  When they select a remote swamp fishing excursion, they get more than they bargained for.  The area is similar to the Everglades in Florida, and just as dangerous.  Areas like this around the world are filled with deadly snakes and gators or crocs.  In Australia the crocodiles get as large as thirty feet.  This family unfortunately finds out that they can overturn a small fishing boat.  When a croc overturns their boat they must try to figure out how to survive or die a horrible death.  I recommend this movie if you enjoy scary creatures stories.  This is not for small children!

3292922,3,B00111YM56,"I found myself laughing at the characters' dialogue. Some of it feels passable for a survival situation of this kind, but other times, it felt fake.

The writers seemed to be going for delirium when they had one character recite the teasing mister crocodile children's rhyme. Another character later on in the movie spouts off the lines, too. The actors should be commended for their performances, though, even if the writing feels unrealistic. And for an hour and a half movie about three characters getting trapped in a tree by a crocodile, it feels like most of the dialogue is only there to pad the length and build suspense.

So by the end of it, to be honest I didn't really care about the shallow and dully written characters. So what makes this movie a 3 star film and ultimately, worth watching?

The crocodile. He's really the main star of the cast here, and he's the real McCoy. As far as I know, there is very little CGI. Most of the shots are of a real crocodile. The only minor problem is that they obviously used a variety of crocodile footage: the crocodile looks much smaller in some shots than in others.

But other than that lack of consistency, the crocodile managed to terrify me, especially towards the end of the movie when the tension reaches a fever pitch.

On the whole, I feel like this film is slightly overrated. The lack of consistency with the crocodile sizes, the shallow characters, and the lack of extremely suspenseful scenes until the very end all contribute to this. But if you're in the mood for a man-eating animal movie with some decent suspense and a satisfying conclusion, I can heartily recommend Black Water.",1354752000,,1652,4.6632302405498285

Extremely well done, low-budget film that has great direction, acting and subject going for it. Crocodile footage is seamlessly sewn into the scenes requiring actor interaction.
This has more of a dreadful feel to it as opposed to big budget films because this is played as a real situation as opposed to a hollywood script of the 'Jaws' caliber but this film is just as effective if not more so because of the deliberate 'reality' that's been produced.
 Being eaten alive probably sucks. Films like this will allay any doubt and it's loosely based on a true account.

Instead, I got one of the best and perhaps the most realistic movie of this type. The movie is about a group of friends who take a fishing trip out into the mangrove swamp of Northern Australia. Soon, however, they get more than they barganined for when an enormous croc flips their boat, kills their tour guide, and traps them up in a tree. What really seperates this movie from so many others is the story is convincing. As someone who has read extensively about crocidiles, I can tell you that everything the croc does in this movie can be done by crocs in the wild. Now perhaps not all at once as the movie depicts, but just about every specific action can be done. Another thing is the acting. The acting in this movie is by far the best acting I have seen in any movie (much less a horror one) in a long, long time. You can literally feel the terror of the characters. In addition, the croc is the most realistic looking movie monster in a long time, as it should since they used real crocs for many of the scenes. I can't praise this movie enough. Buy it, watch it.

It gives you some pretty good character development so as viewer I cared what happened to them. There must be something about Australia and killer crocodile movies because another good killer Croc movie Rogue was from Australia as well.
In this film a married couple and the wife's sister go out on a fishing trip in a rather small boat and while finishing the boat is over turned and the family get to a tree, unfortunately the guide that took them out wasn't as lucky.
From here on you have a great thriller as the hungry Croc terrorizes and stalks the family as they try and devise ways to make their escape.
The water is so dark and murky that it makes it all the more creepy and scary because we know there is something down there but where and when it will pop up is another story.
Who if any will survive,and how will they do it stuck miles and miles away from anywhere populated and a boat that is overturned in the middle of the murky croc infested water?

3292930,4,B00111YM56,"2007's ""Black Water"" is an Australian crocagator flick made for only $700,000, which shows you can make a quality movie on a very low budget. Not that ""Black Water"" is anything especially amazing, but it is the most realistic crocagator flick I've ever seen (although I haven't yet seen the acclaimed ""Rogue,"" another Australian croc film from 2007).

PLOT: While on vacation, a man, his wife, her sister and a guide go fishing in a mangrove swamp in northern Australian where they get attacked by a croc, who is hardly ever seen in the muddy waters. They find temporary sanctuary in the trees but know they'll die of thirst if they don't make an effort to escape the remote swamp. But how?

The story is said to be based on true events, which I don't doubt since the film smacks of near total realism. This of course sets it apart from most crocagator flicks, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alligator/dp/B000SQFBZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alligator</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crocodile/dp/B00004YS98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crocodile</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-Placid-2-Unrated/dp/B000WTVZGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake Placid 2 (Unrated)</a>"" which have too much goofiness to take very seriously. While I enjoy those movies, especially ""Crocodile,"" I always prefer realism if given the choice.

The plot is in some ways reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Skies-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000KF0GT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Skies (Widescreen Edition)</a>"", also from 2007, just substitute the croc for aliens.

Aside from the totally realistic vibe, ""Black Water"" has solid no-name actors in the main roles, particularly the two sisters played by Diana Glenn (Grace) and Maeve Dermody (Lee). Not only are they worthy actors but they're appealing in a girl-next-door type of way.

The only negative I can cite is the thin plot. The story as detailed above is the WHOLE movie. As a result, there's quite a bit of down time, particularly as the survivors mark time in the trees trying to figure out how to escape.

For this reason the film would have probably worked better at the hour mark. As it is, it's 89 minutes with credits and some parts are really sssllllooooooww[...] But the film makes up for it in realism. What would YOU do if you and your loved ones were attacked and cornered by a huge croc in an isolated swamp in the middle of nowhere?

I'm giving ""Black Water"" 4 Stars with reservations: If you're in the mood for a relatively fast-paced, partly goofy, horror thrill-ride, look elsewhere. If you want the awful truth, including many long sequences of heart-wrenching uncertainty and horror, check out ""Black Water.""

3292933,5,B00111YM56,"I have a wierd fear of alligators/crocodiles. Living in Florida you pretty much are used to an alligator being in any body of water, Ive even knowingly swam in lakes that have them. I can hold baby ones, touch adults who have taped mouths of course. My fear only manifests itself in my nightmares where I am pursued by one, or many, and dragged underwater. I know thats just symbolism, but its sure as heck feels like a reptilian nightmare.

This film inhabits those nightmares, and I was crazy in the head to watch it...but I still did! Black Water is an Australian film, based on a true story. The real story involved 3 teens who went for a bike ride by a river and there was a flash flood, the teen boy got pulled under by a crocodile and the other two, both girls,  climbed a tree. The Croc paraded the body past the girls all night, and then stuck around so they couldn't get down, they were finally rescued and the boys' body was never recovered.

In Black Water the characters are also two women who are sisters and the oldest sister's husband. They take a vacation, and ironically go to a crocodile farm. The saltwater croc or ""saltie"" is the largest living reptile. The Australian Saltwater Crocodile population is estimated at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 adults, and its not uncommon to find one measuring in at 19 feet. Most of the farms were opened up by hunters who were capturing a record amount of crocs, and now using them for products (meat, purses, belts, etc) and the tourism aspect brought even more money in. Now they are breeding farms, and no wild crocodiles are brought in, so its turned into a conservation movement as well as an entertainment industry. I bring this up, because now there are fewer hunters and more crocodiles in the wild, and that's where this film comes in.

These three go from the farm, where they observed how crocs can jump out of the water to grab prey, and just how powerful they are in pursuit of a meal, to going fishing down into the mangroves off a main river. While fishing, a crocodile turns over their boat and kills their guide immediately, and they must now find a way to survive its hunt. I love horror movies that take place in one distinct area, in this case a little plot of water, some trees, and a boat. They actually filmed in a real mangrove, with real crocodiles, none of that CGI nonsense that's hardly believable. I had to keep telling myself to breathe at points, and that it was only a movie.

I only have one complaint, and that's the cover of the DVD, don't go by how terrible that is, the Australian release had a better one than the Americanized version.",1298246400,2,2640,4.48024948024948
3292934,5,B00111YM56,"Courtesy of Fear. Net, I sat down to watch this movie with the intent of seeing something light and completely not of the stellar quality. However, within the first fifteen minutes--where barely anything happens in the film--I was pleasantly surprised and settled in for what I believed would be a good film.

Let me tell you, I was not disappointed.

BLACK WATER is about a small group of Australians away on a holiday. After visiting with family and going to the famed crocodile park, Mark, the leading man in this story, decides that he wants to go for some light fishing, but when they discover that they're unable to go they're disheartened and more than willing to abandon the trip--that is, until Jim, another caretaker, offers to take them.

Things seem to be going well immediately. They're getting a few bites, they're having a great time--

Then, out of nowhere, their boat is capsized, their captain killed by a giant crocodile, and they are left to survive, alone, in the Australian outback, with nothing more than a bottle of bug spray, a dead cell phone and a pocket knife.

BLACK WATER is your usual, straight-forward creature-feature film--it features a small group of people who are suddenly thrust into a situation that they cannot control. Miles away from civilization and in a channel hardly-navigated by boat traffic, there seems to be little hope from the get go. This sense of hopelessness is conveyed not only by surprisingly-talented actors, but by an amazing score that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Tension flows and ebbs in wicked tones as the score first rises, then falls in between crocodile sightings. However, this film would be nothing without the amazing actresses who are thankfully focused upon throughout much of the film. Both the women who played Gracie and Lee did an amazing job and set up an amazing chemistry that only further served to complete this film.

Do I have anything bad to say about this movie? Not really. I could have hoped for a more definite ending, but that might just be the fan of heroism in me that makes me desire that. However, that DOES NOT, in the least, detract from this movie.

As of this posting, BLACK WATER can be seen for free on Fear. Net, and for the amount of fun and tension I had whilst watching this film, I would recommend any and everyone who reads this review to seek this film out. Filled with tension up until the very last minute, BLACK WATER is an edge-of-your-seat creature feature with an all-star cast, a beautiful score and a very realistic sense of dread.

3292936,4,B00111YM56,"Opening with a montage of candid vacation photos, Black Water (2007) is a film that unpretentiously tells a story about ordinary people, unexpectedly facing danger.  Supposedly based on real events in Australia, the tale is simple, but quite effectively told, as a party of tourists is attacked by a crocodile, while on a fishing tour.  The survivors experience fear, doubt, confusion, and despair, as the deadly crocodile seems to show up at exactly the wrong time.

Grace (Diana Glenn), her boyfriend Adam (Andy Rodoreda), and her sister Lee (Maeve Dermody) are on vacation together.  With no definite plans, they decide to take a fishing tour on the river.  Boarding a small boat, Jim (Ben Oxenbould) their tour guide takes them out on the river.  While stopped in shallow water, the boat is flipped over by a croc, spilling the group into the water.  Grace and Adam make for a tree, while Lee tangled in some ropes is trapped beneath the capsized boat.  Unfortunately, Jim has become a snack for one of nature's more efficient killing machines.  Eventually, Lee makes her way to the tree, leaving the three survivors stuck up on the branches, looking down into the murky water, with the overturned boat floating few feet away, wondering what they should do.

To say much more, would spoil it for those who haven't seen the film.  With much of the action centered around a boat and a small group of trees, Black Water still holds your interest, and seems to have a high believability factor.  The crocodile is very persistent, and a couple of times gets a bit too frisky, but mostly the creature's behavior seems credible.  The actions of the survivors, seems logical and believable as well.  Their thinking process is clear, and things play out in a very natural and realistic way.  Early on an element is introduced that becomes a crucial factor later, but to story's credit, it takes some effort and intelligence to play this last card.

Black Water is co-written and co-directed by Andrew Traucki, and David Nerlich.  The pair provide an informative commentary track, with some interesting background information.  The cast and crew worked under some very challenging conditions on location.  Actors Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda, and Maeve Dermody are all very good, with Dermody delivering a very credible, and surprisingly gutsy performance.

Black Water is unspectacular and has a slow pace, but is a solidly effective thriller, with some surprises.

A pregnant girl, her bf and the pregnant girls younger sister along with a guide go on a fishing trip in the back waters of northern Australia where they soon meet up with a fiesty and very hungry crocodile.

Let's talk about this crocodile for a moment.  With its pronounced furrows above its eyes it resembles Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes.  If only it would eat Andy Rooney (sigh).

Once they arrive in a tributary called the mangroves, they are immediately up close and personal with the croc who tips over their dinky rowboat and chows down on the guide. The couple scramble out of the water and make it to a tree.  The younger sister is trapped under the boat but she soon pulls herself onto the capsized dinky rowboat.

The croc has finished his guide snack and is now circling the dinky rowboat looking for dessert.

The only gross-out scene involves sound rather than visuals.  The croc has risen to just below the surface of the water, victim firmly clenched in its jaws and offscreen all you hear is the sound of chewing and bone crunching. A great example of imagining besting outright blood and guts.

The balance of the movie is the fate of the trio in the tree.  Will they live? Will they die? Who will survive or can they survive?

The movie is intense and mind numbingly terrifying.

Good movie, not a great movie but well worth a watch and the moral of the story is--If you ever go fishing in the back waters of Australia, watch out for a crocodile with Andy Rooney eyes.",1278288000,2,1608,4.337792642140468

No one is likely to come where they are stranded. And somewhere in the muddy water a huge crocodile is hiding, waiting for the chance to eat them one by one.

""Black Water"" is a solid B-suspense movie. Unlike other killer animal thrillers like ""Alligator"" (1980), ""Black Water"" employs a more realistic approach to tell the story of three hapless travelers and one deadly croc, cleverly using the swamp as the backdrop. Obviously this Australian film was shot with a minimal budget, but the film's atmospheric photography is impressive enough to make us believe the presence of the lurking danger. Sometimes cheap special effects ruin the film in this kind of low budget suspense films, but this doesn't happen in ""Black Water.""

The film claims it is ""based on true events"" (I don't know anything about the events the film refers to), but actually the storyline of ""Black Water"" is pretty familiar to the fans of the genre. Don't get me wrong. This is not to say the film is bad. The acting is very good, and the film's direction is steady and solid, but honestly, the story after the first croc attack is not very surprising.

Black Water is a movie about a group of friends who go out into the water one day with a tour guide to go fishing. After leaving from their mother's house two sisters and one's boyfriend head out for a road trip. After visiting a croc farm they decide it is time to go fishing, doesn't seem like the right move right? So after getting a guide to take them out they spend an uneventful day out on the water that is until the boat rocks. Turns out a very big croc was waiting underneath them and pushed the boat over. That was the last time the guide was seen, and the other three make their way up a tree. From here on out the movie is all about these three in the tree and the croc below.

I remember watching this the first time and thinking here we go another nature run amuck flick that is supposedly based on true events. To my surprise this movie turned out to be good, much better than I expected. From what I can gather this is based on true events from a group of friends that were swimming or something and one got pulled underneath and was gone while the other two made it up a tree. Whether this is true or not it is still an effective and entertaining flick that all should enjoy. I personally like to think that this is based on some truth that is real close to this event. Don't get me wrong I don't like that people got ate alive but knowing that this is true adds a little something to it.

This movie is far from the best thing ever made but it is an effective enough film on the level that it does have a bit on tension to it. I like that the filmmakers stuck to the less is more rule and only showed the croc when necessary. I especially like when the camera just looks to the water and nothing ever appears, then right when you are getting the feeling ever thing is ok just the top of the croc's head appears right in front of someone. Writer/directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki did a great job in my opinion on this indie flick about a killer croc.

As far as performances go they only add to the tension since the small cast all do great jobs. The guys are good in this the boyfriend goes from a geeky looking dude to trying to be the hero, it doesn't work out. But it is the actresses that play the two sisters that steal the show from the boys in this one; the younger one in particular is great. Add in the atmosphere of the film and you have an enjoyable little killer croc flick there are more enjoyable films on this subject if you want gore or even comedy elements in croc/alligator flicks. But if you want a cool indie flick with a good amount of tension, I liked it.

Rogue is slightly better on a technical level, and is a reccommended watch, but overall I thought Black Water was the better movie.

  The plot is basic but the crocodile is a formidable prescence (bolstered by impressive special effects) and the interactions (and sometimes tensions) among the human characters are well done and convincing.  Probably the most notable thing about Black Water is the very thing that, in mentioning it, has the potential to turn a lot of people off it: the croc attack comes early, and the surviving characters proceed to spend a large portion of the movie trapped up in the trees that dot the mangrove.  Now, I realize that sounds like it's going to be stupid, but it says something that the movie actually pulled it off.  The trees are sparse, and as the characters try to manuever from one to the other to make it to land, or clash over whether to brave the shallow, still waters and try and reach their capsized boat, or try to scramble higher up the trees and out of potential reach of the croc's jaws, the movie doesn't drag one bit.  I thought it was worth some kudos that while some movies have all kinds of interesting twists and subplots but can't always make them click, Black Water takes a very bare-bones scenario and keeps it fresh and engaging.  Of course, eventually, the movie does move on as the boaters's fight for survival gets increasingly desperate.  Like a lot of the other killer reptile films, Black Water doesn't really have a villain, per se: the crocodile is hungry, not evil.

I don't think the Jaws comparisons carry much weight, and -as far as the other film comparisons go - who cares?  Even if you've never seen a movie before in your life, you pretty much know how the film is going to play out by the twenty-five minute mark - and that doesn't make the film any less thrilling or suspenseful.  The only question that really matters here is who, if any, of the characters are going to survive.  The plot is one of brutal simplicity - and I mean that as a compliment.

Here's the situation.  You're enjoying a fishing adventure with two family members in a mangrove swamp in Northern Australia when your boat is capsized by a salt-water crocodile.  Two of you manage to scurry up a nearby tree, while the most vulnerable member of your party clings to the top of the overturned boat.  Forget about your tour guide because he doesn't survive the initial attack.  The odds are that no one is going to be looking for you any time soon, and there are hundreds of little tributaries to search if someone does come.  Your best bet is the boat, but - assuming you can first rescue the third member of your party, there's no way to get to the boat without venturing dozens of terrifying meters into the water.  That water, by the way, isn't black but it is definitely dark (I imagine they would have called this movie Dark Water if that title hadn't already been taken so recently) - unless the crocodile shows himself, there's almost no way you're going to know he's coming until he's torn into you with his massive jaws.  What do you do?

I love and respect crocodiles.  They are second only to sharks in the list of nature's most brilliantly designed killing machines.  As unfortunate as the characters' situation is, I can't hate or condemn this salty for doing what he was born to do.  That being said, this particular croc is a mean one; I don't want to give anything away, so just take my word on this.  The big guy's in total control of the situation, and he knows it - and he has all the time in the world to wait for his victims to make a deadly mistake.  You're not looking at some kind of CGI creation or mechanical beast here, either; Black Water serves us the real deal.  Some people, of course, complain that the crocodile does not get enough screen time, but any fan of classic horror can tell you that less is more in situations like this.  Maybe the ending doesn't ring quite true, but overall I found this film disquietingly realistic.

Perhaps the most horrifying thing of all about this film is the fact that it was inspired in part by actual events.  Salt water crocs kill several people a year in Northern Australia, but most of those deaths involve humans doing something they shouldn't be doing.  Here, as in the case that inspired the movie, you simply have a case of three individuals being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I realize I haven't mentioned any of the characters in this film.  We may not get to know them like old friends, but I thought there was definitely adequate characterization in play here - and I thought Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody, and Andy Rodoreda turned in inspired performances.  In fact, I'm going to throw out kudos all around, especially to co-writers and co-directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki.  I understand that this film had a low budget (as little as one million dollars), but I would never have guessed that for myself.  Black Water is an immensely excellent film.",1215820800,34,4337,5.119318181818182
3292948,4,B00111YM56,"I recently reviewed the awful Lake Placid 2 and now we have another moving about a menacing crocodile, Black Water.  Trust me however; the two films could not be more different in every way possible.  Black Water is a true, low-budget diamond in the rough.  In this case, low-budget doesn't mean any sacrifice in quality.  This Australian-produced film is somewhat reminiscent of 2003's Open Water in that it has a very small cast--only five actors are listed in the credits--and is shot in only a few different settings.  The fear in Black Water is largely psychological and comes from what you don't see as much as what you do see.

Set just after Christmas, two sisters Lee (Dermody) and Grace along with Grace's boyfriend, Adam, hire a boat to take them fishing and sightseeing along an Australian river.  The river waters are extremely high, creating a swamp out of the nearby forest.  As the trio cast their lines in the murky waters, their little boat is suddenly overturned by a crocodile who quickly munches their guide as they climb to safety up one of the trees.  Their boat lies overturned, just feet away but it may as well be a mile.  They find themselves completely trapped, surrounded by water and who knows how many crocodiles.

Directors David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki deftly build the suspense as each little splash; each ripple in the water sends a chill of fear through the three survivors.  Adam wants to go for the boat but the sisters want to wait until someone comes along, a prospect Adam insists is useless as know one knows they are even out there.  It becomes a test of nerves and resolve as they try to keep their footing in the tree as exhaustion and starvation assaults them, not to mention the constant biting of mosquitoes.

Unlike Lake Placid, this film doesn't use cheap CGI effects.  In an effort to bring the most realism to the production, they've used real crocodiles, combining them with the actors through blue screen photography which is seamless and often horrifyingly real.  Its real progenitor might be considered Jaws, as you don't see the crocodile a lot, particularly early on, although it does provide some of those signature jump-out-of-your-seat moments.  You knew the croc was always out there, lurking about but you never knew where.

The cast was superb because they were so completely real and believable.  There was not a hint of overacting.  Adam didn't try to be the typical macho hero and the girls weren't just helpless bimbos.  They all did an outstanding job of conveying the helplessness and desperation of their plight.  Nerves become frayed and tempers begin to flare.  I can honestly say I didn't know who, if any of them, would ever get out of the swamp.

The film was also shot on location in an actual mangrove swamp and provided the crew with only about a three hour window each day as the tide would go out leaving them in a muddy riverbed.  The scenery was beautifully shot and while it was made only a mile or so from Sydney, it strongly suggested a primeval remoteness.  This is one of those little hidden gems that you hope to find on a trip to the video store.  Definitely one to check out.

Extras

The extras included an audio commentary with both directors, a few deleted scenes and an excellent, 23 minute making of documentary featuring interviews with cast and crew.",1213574400,2,3351,4.719449225473322

The use of little known actors and real crocs adds to the sense of documentary in this ""based on actual events"" movie.
Be aware that the movie is slow out of the gate, but picks up plenty of steam by the mid-way point. And like Open Water, much of the suspense is built on what you don't see, more than what you do.",1211328000,,573,6.175
