8601202,3,B00E4V0F2Y,"If anyone is looking to make a Christian version of MST3K, this is the movie for you! Its fantastically flawed... 3 stars for making me laugh a lot.
If you want a better theatrical depiction of the nativity story, look for the more recent one.",1514419200,,243,4.4222222222222225
8601203,1,B00E4V0F2Y,It seemed like they took some old movie from a foriegn country and added some terrible naration over the top. The lips didn;t match any of the words and to make matters worse it was such a cheesy unaccurate bible interpretation. I wasted way to much money on this.,1391040000,2,264,4.408163265306122
8601204,1,B00E4V0F2Y,"This cover made it seem like a contemporary style film, it's just an old VSH tape put onto a DVD, cheesy, poor quality, never even watched it long enough to see if the doctrine was correct. So expensive and NOT worth a nickel.",1389484800,2,226,4.27906976744186
8601205,1,B00E4V0F2Y,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! I only gave it one star so I could write this review. I only watched 10 minutes of this movie with my 22yo son before we couldn't stand to watch it anymore! It seems like it was copied from parts of very old films. It was not clear, but very grainy, blurry, snowy, and bits and pieces of other movies or something. It is suppose to be a brand new movie. Don't waste your money!",1388707200,2,419,4.0
