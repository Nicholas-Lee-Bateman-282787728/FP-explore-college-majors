8510987,5,B0076L0ROU,"I really enjoy this DVD. It offers a nice slow-paced yang workout and finishes with some long holds (yin). It's great for the days when I don't feel up to a strong workout but still need to stretch my muscles.

Sarah Powers has a pleasant voice, and her instructions are very clear. I know nothing about energy meridians, but notice I do feel good after this workout.

I would rate this as a beginner workout, or good for when one does not want a strenuous work-out.",1394928000,2,466,4.406976744186046
8510988,5,B0076L0ROU,"I feel that the author appears to be quite knowledgeable on the subject.  The photos are abundant and clear of what you are supposed to be doing.  Lots of great information for someone who wants to go beyond and learn more about the effects of holding poses longer and the organs and meridians that are affected.  I have also purchased two of her DVD's for yin and yang practices (Heaven and Earth practices) and I find them to be a nice complement to the book.  I'm used to faster pace vinyasa and ashtanga practices, but find this to be a more therapeutic approach and nice to include for a well rounded practice.",1355356800,,615,4.464285714285714
8510989,2,B0076L0ROU,"The yoga section is very slow & monotonous, talking, and feels forced.  I only used this DVD for the meditation occasionally, which is also somewhat lacking in presentation.",1350172800,,173,5.178571428571429
8510990,5,B0076L0ROU,"I had enough money for only one Dvd of Sarah Powers so I read the reviews hoping to chose between her Yin energy video and this one.  When I read that this one included a head stand I felt intimidated and purchased the other one. I like the Yin very much. It is a strong workout and leaves me feeling well grounded.  In hindsight however, this one would have been the more appropriate work out for me.

Let me preface this by saying, if you don't want to do a headstand Sarah offers other options. In fact, Sarah recommends you omit headstand unless you have already established a confident headstand practice prior to using this video.  She also suggests you learn how to do one with a live teacher and NOT from a dvd. I agree with her.  Bad alignment is dangerous.  Don't do a headstand unless you know what you are doing. Otherwise, just do the alternate poses she demonstrates.

There are two sequences both designed to balance yang energy.  This work out is much more meditative than her Yin energy dvd.  I liked the visualizations.  Yang energy is depleted by prolonged sadness. Depleted yang energy weakens the lungs.  I have experienced prolonged sadness since my husband left me in 2007, in addition I used to smoke cigarettes. So this was an appropriate workout for me on more than one level.

After completing one of these workouts, it's not like I feel sweaty and tired. I feel balanced, relaxed, ready to face life.  My lungs and the space around them in my chest cavity feels vulnerable and sensitive.  This is a heart warming exercise, good for creating focus.  Some of the poses look pretty simple if you are watching Sarah and her husband. I suggest in lieu of watching them listen carefully to the cueing and follow the exact directions. You will find the poses can be very stimulating.  Done repetitively this work out increased my body awareness.

I would recommend this to someone who has already done a fair amount of yoga with a live teacher and is familiar with the basic yoga poses.  I think it's a little arcane for someone who has never done yoga, and may seem slow to a beginner.",1346803200,6,2107,4.558510638297872

INSIGHT YOGA HEAVEN is one of two new DVDs offered by yoga instructor Sara Powers.  Powers and her husband, Ty Powers, are founders of the Insight Yoga Institute.  The DVD insert explains that Insight Yoga involves a balance between the lower body, which is the earthy or ""Yin"" region, and the upper body, the heavenly or ""Yang"" region.  In Insight Yoga Heaven, the focus is on the relationship between the earth-based energy, which represents stability, and balancing the opening of Yang energy in the upper body.

The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:

  Introduction (1.5 min)
  Practices Menu
  Special Features Menu

Selecting the Practices menu opens the following submenu:

  Practice Overview (9 min; audio only)
  Yoga Practices
  Strengthening the Lung Chi (65 min)
  Ground Support:  Breathing Into the Hara (45 min)
  Meditation Practice
  Karuna Meditation (16 min)

I have provided a general overview of each practices below.  Powers and her husband are shown in a studio with wooden floors, and Powers instructs via voiceover.

YOGA PRACTICE #1:  Strengthening the Lung Chi
This practice combines active postures with yin poses. Powers begins seated on the heels, using diaphragmatic breathing to focus on the hara (belly center).  This is followed by holding happy babies pose.  Next comes a series of flowing postures (cat/cow, downward facing dog, standing forward bend, dolphin pose, plank); Powers concludes this sequence with shoulder-opening work using a strap.  She then cues an inversion, giving viewers the option of kicking up into handstand at the wall, coming into headstand, or repeating dolphin pose.  Pranayama (breathwork) follows, including kabalabati and single-nostril breathing.  The final phase of this practice is the yin segment:  each yin posture is held approximately 4-5 minutes.  The poses include quarter dog, sphinx or seal (with breath retention), half dragonfly, and a repetition of happy babies pose.  Powers concludes with a 3.5 minute savanasa which uses the mantra ""om mani padme hum"" to regulate the length of the breath.

YOGA PRACTICE #2:  Breathing Into the Hara
Powers notes that this practice will center around yin poses lying on the back.  She again starts the practice seated, timing diaphragmatic breathing to the ""om mani padme hum"" chant.  Most of the yin postures are held approximately 3-5 minutes each.  Lying on the back, the first sequence involves a series of poses performed with one leg, including knee-to-chest, head-to-knee, hamstring stretch, half stirrup (a.k.a. half happy baby), thread-the-needle, and a crossed leg twist; the entire sequence is then repeated on the other side.  Additional yin poses are bridge (moving into supported bridge) and happy babies pose.  The final sequence is an abs series which includes a vinyasa, flowing in and out of revolved stomach pose, and small upper body crunches with wide legs.  Powers concludes the practice with 2 minutes in reclined butterfly and then a final minute (or more, if you have the time) in savasana.

MEDITATION PRACTICE:  Karuna Meditation
Powers explains that karuna, meaning compassion, is based on the Tibetan meditation Tonglen, or giving and taking.  She states that there are five steps towards this meditation, including consciously relaxing ideas of right/wrong and using the breath as a vehicle.  Although Powers provides occasional instructions, much of this meditation is silent.

Powers has a soothing manner in these practices.  This DVD is likely to appeal to those who have enjoyed her previous work, as it has a strong yin focus.  However, there were a few things about Powers' presentation that I didn't like.  First, although the inclusion of the ""om mani padme hum"" mantra was potentially an excellent tool for breath regulation, it is difficult to hear, especially given that Powers frequently talks over it.  Second, the meditation practice does not seem appropriate for those trying to establish a new meditation practice, as it is fairly long as well as lacking in sufficient instruction for the novice.",1332892800,6,4243,5.230654761904762
