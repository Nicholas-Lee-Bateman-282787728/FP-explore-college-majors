He was an interesting fellow and I would put this DVD in the category of home movies--a bit grainy and not high quality at all. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.",1402358400,,263,4.387755102040816
8390601,5,B0037HA13O,"I first saw this years ago and continue to find it one of the best overviews of the life and work of R. Buckminster Fuller. This DVD, created by his son-in-law, offers a glimpse into the incredible brilliance of the ""Planet's friendly genius"". Bucky was ahead of his time, purposely, and many of his predictions from 50+ years ago are coming into reality now. I enjoy the clarity of this work.",1358985600,3,393,4.549295774647887
