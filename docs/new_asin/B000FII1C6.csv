2567957,5,B000FII1C6,"A wonderful production of Patience. Very funny, great costumes, fabulous singing and arch acting - what more can one ask for from Gilbert and Sullivan?
There are some nice live mistakes and recoveries going on that add to the enjoyment value.",1283558400,2,242,4.926829268292683
2567958,5,B000FII1C6,"Saw this brilliant and funny production in Sydney in 1995 and loved it. So great to have a copy of it, particularly with Opera Australia's Heather Begg now retired. Before I saw 'Patience' I wasn't aware of any of the music, or indeed the story, but Anthony Warlow, Christine Douglas, Denis Olsen and Co., have won me over. If you love Gilbert & Sullivan then you'll love 'Patience'.",1276041600,6,383,4.647058823529412
2567959,5,B000FII1C6,"Whenever I can contrive to show this to guests they are surprised and amazed that Gilbert and Sullivan can be such fun!  I have three other Opera Australia Gilbert and Sullivans and there is not a dud in the lot but this is the one I reach for first.  If I were to rank order them on the basis of musicality and shear fun this would be number one with Gondoliers a close second and then Pirates and finally Pinafore (which is enhanced somewhat by the inclusion of Trial by Jury).  None of them are bad and all are well received by those who see them.  Some of the stage business is very clever.  Heather Begg accompanying herself on the sting bass for instance as well as the persistent cymbal player in the women's chorus bring chortles of joy.  Also watch for the slip near the end when an exuberant Heather Begg nearly knocks Reginald into the orchestra pit. I'm so glad the editors didn't chop this amazing bit out. Some of my friends are Anglophyles and are amazed at the character Patience' accent which they guess may be lowland Scotts.

 I recommend Patience and only await an updated Mikado.",1268006400,7,1100,4.465
2567960,5,B000FII1C6,"Patience has long been a G&S favorite of mine.  It is the funniest in the entire series, funnier than ""The Mikado"", and has curiously not been so popular in recent decades.  Some speculate because a send-up of the 19th century Aesthetic Movement is meaningless today, but that has never made sense to me.  Patience is as timeless as any other, being in fact a satire on the entire culture of celebrities and fandom, and it doesn't miss a single trick.  This production is certainly the best on DVD, with stellar performances, most notably by ""Reggie & Archie"", the two ridiculous poets who dominate the story, and who are extremely well portrayed by David Hobson and Anthony Warlow.  Lots of fun.",1234224000,10,696,4.766666666666667
2567961,5,B000FII1C6,"""Patience"" was my introduction to the Savoy operas  -  nearly 50 years ago now!  -  and I think this is the best production that I have seen.  The opera is a brilliant parody of the Aesthetic Movement, and deserves to be far better known.  Gilbert obviously thoroughly enjoyed himself making fun of the ridiculous pretensions and jargon of the aesthetes (and for that reason newcomers might find it helpful to have the libretto to hand  -  otherwise, to quote Ruddigore, some of the patter may indeed be unintelligible).  Perhaps because he was having such a good time, he made Lady Jane a far more likable character than his usual formidable contralto, and Heather Begg plays the role to perfection.  The rest of the cast are equally strong, and the Australian Opera orchestra is in great form.  Because the recording was made for television, it uses the full screen without sacrificing any of the action.  As far as I could tell, there were very few deviations from the original libretto, a great relief after the butchery of some of the ""made for television"" versions of the other operas.  Recommended without any reservations.",1224720000,31,1130,4.853403141361256
2567962,5,B000FII1C6,"With so many mediocre Gilbert & Sullivan productions on film, it is great when a really good one appears. I rate this particular production as the best of any Gilbert & Sullivan video I have seen. The cast, most notably Anthony Warlow as Grosvenor, Dennis Olsen as Bunthorne and Heather Begg as Lady Jane, are spectacular. It is well staged, well performed, well directed and well orchestrated.

For traditional Gilbert & Sullivan fans, this is a must. While the less enthusiastic Gilbert & Sullivan fans may lean towards the better known HMS Pinafore, Mikado and Pirates of Penzance productions, if you wish to see how well a Gilbert & Sullivan show can be produced and captured on film, I strongly recommend you check this one out.",1219622400,26,733,4.817460317460317
2567963,5,B000FII1C6,"Opera Australia has performed a great service by making a video recording of Patience and making it commercially available. Patience, though a hit in Gilbert & Sullivan's time, is largely forgotten today, since the target of the satire, the Aesthetic Movement, is so topical. That is unfortunate, because as Opera Australia demonstrates, the show is a lot of fun and has something to appeal to everyone. Specifically, Patience can be thought of as a satire on cultural fads and the cult of celebrity. For example, toward the end of the show (possible spoilers), after Archibald becomes a ""commonplace young man"" on threat of a curse by Bunthorne, all of his devoted female followers follow suit and disregard their aesthetic demeanor. As Angela explains, ""It means that Archibald the All-Right cannot be all-wrong; and if the All-Right chooses to discard aestheticism, it proves that aestheticism ought to be discarded."" In other words, they are imitating him because he's a celebrity, a phenomenon just as real today as it was then. Besides that, the music in Patience is as good as any Sullivan wrote, and Gilbert wrote some of the most witty dialogue of his career. In short, this is a must-own for any fan of musicals, light opera, and Gilbert & Sullivan particularly, and indeed anyone who is looking for some whimsical fun. Highly recommended.",1208304000,41,1349,5.026785714285714
2567991,5,B000FII1C6,We bought the disc because we have tickets to the Theatre at Monmouth production of Patience and we were not familiar with the show. We also purchased the complete librettos of Gilbert and Sullivan plays so that we could understand the words. The Australian Symphony performance was outstanding and helped us enjoy the production immensely.,1379721600,,340,5.2
2567992,5,B000FII1C6,"A wonderful production by the Australian opera. Perfect performances by the entire cast. Despite the slightly bad transfer, which I suppose can't be helped in a 90s TV show, this is worth every penny and is an essential part of anyone's G&S collection.",1373068800,,252,4.883720930232558

2567994,5,B000FII1C6,"Patience is one of my favorite G&S shows, and this Australian Opera rendition is great.  Every character is perfect.  While Patience is not the very young village milkmaid that we are accustomed to, she has a fabulous voice.  Bunthorne is super, Lady Jane, The Duke, the chorus.  There is not a slow part in this show.",1354924800,,318,4.625
2567995,5,B000FII1C6,"Never have I seen a better production of ""Patience."" One or two equally good, none better. While staying solidly in touch with today, it gives one a sense of how this show might have looked to its original audiences, fresh and joyous. I enjoy both kinds of productions, traditional and revamped -- e.g., ""The Black Mikado"" -- when they are done with respect to the authors' spirit. For a traditional production, this ""Patience"" is absolutely top of the line, and makes for a DVD I might well choose to introduce friends to G&S.",1354579200,2,527,4.67741935483871
2567996,3,B000FII1C6,"This production is professionally done and pleasant in many ways, but I was hoping for an improvement to Opera World's Patience.  I do prefer a stage performance, which this is.  Unfortunately I found the sound quality was not as good as, say, the Stratford productions from the '80s. I could not understand the words of the songs - which was my problem with the Opera World production.  Thankfully, Warlow and Olsen as Archibald and Bunthorne were easier to understand and I enjoyed their performance very much.  Patience's accent is rather amazing which made me think it was 'put on' to sound like a commoner. I found this distracting, so I enjoyed her songs more than speech. Heather Begg as Lady Jane was most annoying.  I guess her performance was correct - she sang the right notes, though her pretense with the cello was rough-around-the-edges - but I don't happen to like her voice: I found it harsh.  I was wanting Anne Collins (Opera World) back.  Whoever did Begg's make-up made her hard to look at.  I had the impression that they took a pretty woman and tried to make her look old with lines in all the wrong places and weird eyebrows.  They should have just grayed some strands of hair.  The final straw was that Begg fell out of character near the end and could not regain her composure.  She may have a reputation as a singer, but she is not a good actress.  If I had checked this production out of the library, I would have been content. I might even check it out again (and fast-forward the blooper) because I like this music so much and the orchestra was very good.  But I am sorry I paid for it.",1349740800,,1615,4.489726027397261

2567998,4,B000FII1C6,"This is a terrific performance of what I think is the wittiest of the Savoy Operas. In its initial run, Patience was extremely popular, bested only by The Mikado. Since then, unfortunately, it has usually been either updated (with mixed success), or performed in a fairly stodgy imitation of the D'Oyly Carte style. Its music is fine, but the comedy is the real selling point. The original Victorian audiences probably found it hilarious, but modern audiences too often find themselves wondering what they are watching, and hoping it won't last much longer.

This cast does a very solid job with the humor, probably the best you're likely to see. Although I wouldn't say it was as side-splittingly funny as it could possibly be made. A gag here or there fell a little flat, and it seemed to me more could have been made of the officers' medievalism scene. Even though I've seen the Bunthorne-Grosvenor-Patience scenes many times, I still laughed aloud at them. But even these could probably have been more finely tuned. If a really terrific comedic director and a cast of comedic geniuses ever got hold of this opera, I think the result would be legendary.

The singing is very good too. And, surprisingly, so is the dancing, which is usually not given much attention. I was amazed to see Anthony Warlow (terrific as Archibald Grosvenor) sing and dance his way off the stage at the end of ""When I Go Out of Door,"" then back for an encore, and still manage to sing as if he were standing still the whole time. The rest of the cast is great as well.

The costumes look good on screen, and even the set is attractive, which can't always be said even for professionally produced DVDs of these operas. Often they're filmed in ordinary stage costumes (which look fine from a distance, but close up, not so much); and with ordinary flat stage scenery, or sometimes on unconvincing TV sound stages.  The set has a slightly abstract look, but still manages to evoke the opera's Pre-Raphaelitism.

I'm giving this production four stars because I think there's just a bit of room for improvement. But overall, it's quite a good production and, if you're a fan, definitely worth owning.",1326240000,4,2174,4.7407407407407405
2567999,5,B000FII1C6,"This is a very traditional performance of what many consider to be one of the minor Gilbert and Sullivan Operettas.  The performances are good, the staging is unexciting but traditional.  The camera work, the sound, the color quality, etc are all very good.

8123172,1,B000FII1C6,"It's a bit daunting to have to write this given the flock of ""positive"" reviews -- are they from family members of the cast? -- but this production of ""Patience"" is simply grotesque. As some will know, ""Patience"" is Gilbert and Sullivan's send-up of the late 1880s aesthetic movement (think Whistler, Oscar Wilde), and when done correctly it's both hilarious and, in its own way, curiously moving. But every production of ""Patience"" I've seen over the years has done its best to preserve the D'Oyly Carte style of presentation: clear and distinct delivery of the songs -- much of both their wit and their satiric point depends on the intricacy of the language -- and I've never seen that style, even in amateur and college productions, fail to delight the audience. The music and lyrics together are dazzling. But in this production you have no idea of what the lyrics say or mean.

  This production might have been undertaken by a cast of ""Teach Yourself English in Ten Weeks"" summer study students in Outer Mongolia, each with his or her own idea of how English vowels and consonants go together, none with an idea of how English is actually pronounced, and several light-years away from the crystalline clarity and wit of the actual Gilbert and Sullivan lyrics. I understand that this may be partly due to its being an Australian production -- I have Australian friends, and have been known to ""speak 'Strine"" myself after a few pints -- but that's no excuse for the totally unintelligible delivery of the cast members in this production. Actors and singers are supposed to leave their own native dialects behind and speak or sing (or both) in the spirit of the original. That is, after all, the point of being trained as an actor or singer. The music in the production is fine -- it is, after all, Gilbert and Sullivan -- but listening to the songs is like hearing them delivered in some unidentifiable foreign tongue.",1504051200,2,1923,4.751497005988024

8123176,5,B000FII1C6,"This is a terrific version of Patience.  Anthony Warlow is a wonderful, kinetic Grosvenor; ""When I go out of door"" in the second act is a highlight.  Heather Begg also stands out as Lady Jane (she's clearly an audience favorite, and deserves to be).  Christine Douglas sings gorgeously in the title role, even if she does come on a bit strong with the lower-class accent.  Opera Australia really did a fine job on Gilbert and Sullivan's spoof of the celebrity cult.  It's about as well done as I can imagine a production being.",1432684800,,527,4.623655913978495
8123177,5,B000FII1C6,"This is a very good modern version of this G&S Savoy opera. It tells the story of a milkmaid who is loved by a poet, Reginald. However, Reginald has a rival, Archibald. This whole opera is about whether a group of young ladies would fall in love with the soldiers from an Army garrison, or one of the two poets. There are also several well known tunes to this one. For instance, ""Magnet in a Hardware Shop"", or ""Go to Him and Say to Him"", and ""When I Go Out The Door"". If one can't find a video from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Opera Australia is a very good choice.",1424995200,,570,4.1441441441441444

You won't be disappointed in this Australian production.",1418947200,,321,5.469387755102041
8123179,5,B000FII1C6,"Just wonderful!

I began listening to G&S when still a child -- taken to performances of Doyle Carte when they'd visit New York.  But Patience I only became familiar with after discovering the libretto in the early `70s.  Reading Bunthorne's words back then, when I'd just cut my hair for the first time in years, was a mind-blowing experience.

""If you're anxious for to shine in the high aesthetic line
As a man of culture rare,
You must get up all the terms
Of the transcendental terms,
And plant them everywhere.
You must lie upon the daises
And discourse in novel phrases
Of your complicated state of mind,
The meaning doesn't matter
If it's only idle chatter
Of a transcendental kind.

And every one will say
As you walk your mystic way,
""If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me,
Why, what a very singularly deep young man
This deep young man must be!""

How could that possibly have been written 90 years earlier?  No, as Solomon wrote, ""nothing is new under the sun.""

I immediately bought the LP and got to see a pretty good performance a short time later by the Harvard University Gilbert and Sullivan Society, but finding a worthy one for my video collection took until now.  This is, how can say this? If not absolute perfection, definitely (as Lady Jane would word it) ""all but.""

The performance that is. The acting, the singing, the sets. Only the old, pre HD, standards let it down. But that is a small price to pay for simply having this available.  Yes, it is that good.

Truly a must for any ""Patience"" fan - and a great introduction to this wonderful and rarely performed operetta for any fan of G&S.

Highly recommended!!!",1409961600,,1663,4.558922558922559
8123180,2,B000FII1C6,"I've never been much of a Patience fan but bought this DVD because I've enjoyed my other recent G&S purchases.  Pinafore/Trial By Jury, also by Opera Australia was far superior to Patience.  I have no trouble understanding my D'Oyly Carte CDs, but the lack of articulation (primarily in the female parts) and variety of accents (Patience seemed to fluctuate between Scottish and English Cockney)  made me pull out a libretto to follow the words.  The music was superb.  The costumes were good.  The acting seemed wooden.  I have no grounds to return the DVD but I certainly wouldn't buy it again.",1406160000,,596,4.841584158415841
