3118346,5,B0013NAMM4,"Hemalayaa and Bollywood is a new concept for me.  I recently purchased ""Beautiful Belly"" with Hemalayaa and will never use another work out video instructor.  She is fun with a great attitude.  The video has three different 12 minute workouts and a five minute warm up to keep boredom at bay.  I started out doing the warm up, plus one of the three circuits.  I am now able to do the full workout and my abs have never felt stronger!

Some of the dance moves require a lot of hopping and twisting so make sure your lower body joints are warmed up!  If you are a klutz (like I can be) and the moves get too complicated, try doing jumping jacks or shimmying to keep the heartrate up.  The idea is to mix cardio moves intermittenly with more specific ab work.  You might want to research some very basic bellydance moves before starting because she may use words you are not familiar with.  However, you can always just copy her movements.

IMPORTANT:  This woman is obviously highly trained and very flexible.  DO NOT attempt to make your moves look like hers unless you're very advanced.  Most people will not form the perfect ""Cobra"" or ""Downward Dog"" the first time they try.  She should talk more about your ability level, but since she doesn't, just keep it in mind!

This video is fun and addictive.  The music is great and the set design is pleasing to the eye.  I want to go out and buy a coin belt to start bellydancing now!",1228089600,35,1431,4.417624521072797
3118347,5,B0013NAMM4,"I LOVE Hemalayaa's dvds.  I have been a fan of hers for quite some time, and though I try other dvds I still come back to hers time after time.  Her dvds are effective, fun, and put a smile on my face.  Every part of your body gets worked out, I always work up a sweat, and I always have fun.  I have finally started to see some progress in my weight loss goals by using her Beautiful Belly dvd along with her first Bollywood dance dvd.  I can't wait to try the other ones.",1227484800,,473,3.9368421052631577
3118348,5,B0013NAMM4,"This DVD is really fun and a great ab workout.  I love the music, the set, and the moves.  Hemalayaa is a great instructor with a lot of positive energy -- this DVD is a great addition to any home gym library.",1227398400,,209,3.9523809523809526
3118349,5,B0013NAMM4,"This is my favorite Hemalayaa DVD so far!  I've been using it for nearly 2 weeks now, and my belly really is getting more beautiful-- by which I mean flatter and more taut.  The workouts are fun and energizing, and you just can't help laughing along with Hemalayaa.",1215993600,3,265,4.5
3118350,1,B0013NAMM4,"I bought this dvd because everyone said how great Hemalayaa is.  She is suppose to be a yogini that incorporates Bollywood flair into her workouts.  I didn't like this video at all.  I've been doing yoga for years--several times a week.  I take class with instructors, do my own practice, and have several dvds that I enjoy.  Halfway through this workout, I had had enough.  She's all over the place.  She provides poor instruction.  There's a pilates section that is poorly done.  She constantly has you switching direction so your belly never gets the benefit of the exercise.  You're so busy trying to keep up with her changes that the workout isn't fun and not very beneficial.  If you want an amazing yoga workout, try one of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's dvds.  If you're looking for more of an aerobic/dance workout, try something else.",1215475200,16,840,4.7172413793103445
3118351,5,B0013NAMM4,"I agree with the other reviewers that Hemalayaa is very inspiring and fun to watch and work out with.  I feel she invites you to share in the fun with her, and believe me - these ARE workouts.  You WILL be dripping!!  I feel her secret is inviting you to have fun with her, and you are working out without feeling it.  Definately a change from the 1-2-3-4-I'm bored weight lifting routines.  Be advised though, there are some parts which may be challenging for you if you are not flexible, so maybe watch first so you don't get caught up and hurt yourself.  I also have her other workout DVD's and they are just as much fun and work.  Try something new!",1214438400,12,653,4.30327868852459
3118352,5,B0013NAMM4,"I needed something to kick up my ab routine and this is it!  I recently moved to LA and saw Hema on the KTLA morning news promoting her video.  I ran out right away and bought it!  It's really fun and she's very positive and encouraging.  It was a great workout, very different moves but felt really effective.  I want to get her Bollywood Burn now too.  If you're looking for something different than crunches than get this video!",1213660800,3,431,4.3924050632911396
3118353,5,B0013NAMM4,"I recently discovered Hemalayaa Behl's incredibly fun workouts ""Bollywood Dance"" and ""Bollywood Burn"" (check them out, they are a blast!) and I think I am going to love her ""Beautiful Belly"" workout just as much.  Like the other two DVDs this one gets you sweating right away with lots of shimmies, hops, and other bhangra-inspired dance moves.  In addition to the cardio, Hema also mixes in some more traditional abdominal work (pilates-type leg circles, yoga boat pose) and some non-traditional ab work as well.

The workout starts off with a six minute cardio warm-up.  Following the warm-up are three separate twelve minute segments.  Each of these segments incorporates both dance and ab work.  If pressed for time you could do the warm-up and one of the twelve minute segments, but honestly, this workout is so much fun, once you start you don't want it to end.  My only criticism of the workout is that there is no ""cool-down"" segment, which would be nice here because the final segment ends with some vigorous belly dance moves, and definitely left me sweating.

Like Hemalayaa's other two ""dance"" workouts, ""Bollywood Dance"" and ""Bollywood Burn,"" this workout is driven by Hemalayaa's infectious spirit of fun and play.  The set and costumes are great, the music keeps you moving, and Hema keeps you smiling and inspired.",1213228800,47,1330,4.981900452488688
3118354,5,B0013NAMM4,"I've done all of Hema's other dance workouts & I think she's incredible! Some of the reviews for Bollywood Dance and Bollywood Burn criticize the music & the silliness. But I think the music is infectious & really makes you want to get moving! Hema's style IS silly & she tells you that, it isn't supposed to be formal or stiff...it's just a good time dancing around & gettin' your heart rate up. A fun workout to break the every day routine is just what you get with this. It's a blast!",1212624000,6,487,4.304347826086956

3118366,2,B0013NAMM4,"I ordered this hoping to do a workout with out laying on the floor. One lesson is all going up and down, on the floor, off the floor. The warm up routine may actually be here real warm up routine? That is not a good thing, its pretty close to jumping up and down and flailing your arms. Threw the whole video she only warns you about changing moves five times, everytime else is a surprise. I wish I could return it.",1401667200,,416,4.085365853658536
3118367,4,B0013NAMM4,"Okay, so I am a big ol' weenie when it comes to working out.  I hate to do it, I grumble about doing it and I complain when I am done doing it.  This video is a blast.  I wish that it had more dance it in, but it really is a fun video to workout with.  By the end my abs were sore and tight, I felt ready to move on to the next event of the day and it helped tuck me into my new dress.  It is well worth the money and the time.",1398038400,3,427,3.3608247422680413
3118368,2,B0013NAMM4,"This lady moves too fast, doesn't explain anything, it's hard to even see what she is doing and even harder to follow.  Many moves are not safe for lower back, might hurt someone who didn't do any yoga before and doesn't know safety tips for yoga practice (they are not explained either).",1390435200,3,288,4.538461538461538
3118369,3,B0013NAMM4,"First I'll offer some general comments that apply to the whole DVD, then I'll talk about the individual sections a little bit.  After careful consideration, I'm ambivalent about this one.  Hopefully something I write (even if you don't agree with me) will help you make a decision for yourself, though.

Pros:

*the set is beautiful
*the music, while it seems to be on endless loop, is not annoying (you get different music in each section)
*because Hemalayaa demonstrates by herself, there are no co-participants in the background who can't keep up or who are doing different moves (which is something I've seen in other DVDs featuring Hemalayaa)
*you will not need a lot of equipment (could use a cushion or pillow in one part but could also get by without it)

Cons:

*the camera work is horrible; it jumps around all the time and the end result is that sometimes when you really need to be able to see Hemalayaa's legs to see what she's doing, you can't because the camera is focusing on something else
*the voiceover can be annoying (although there is an option to turn it off); Hemalayaa talks constantly but it seems like she is offering commentary on something she's never seen before instead of giving instructions on how to do the exercises
*no discussion of proper form
*Hemalayaa spends a lot of time fiddling with her hair and pants (perhaps it would interfere with the look she was trying to create, but a ponytail and pants that don't move so much might've eliminated this aspect of things)

In terms of the exercises themselves, there's actually a nice variety; I recognized yoga asanas, a bit from Pilates, plus bellydancing and a bit of bhangra dancing.  In each of the workout segments, you do go from cardio standing up to floor exercises, then back up and down again.  So if you don't like constant changes from floor to standing positions, this DVD might not be for you.  Alternatively, you could think of it a bit like an interval workout (with exceptionally long intervals) -- get your heart rate up a bit, do some floor work, and get your heart rate up again.

On the one hand, the exercises themselves are not difficult to understand.  There's not really any complicated choreography here.  On the other hand, there is a risk of injury if you're not an advanced exerciser.  The moves are demonstrated in bare feet on a carpet.  But there is a lot of jumping and hopping, which could be problematic if you've got bad knees.  Also, whenever squat-like exercises are performed, Hemalayaa has a tendency to have her knees way out over her toes, which is not ever recommended by fitness professionals (as it can lead to injury).  Only, you are not told that this could cause knee problems.  I'd have preferred more actual instruction, including safety advice.  Because of the amount of jumping and hopping (which makes this somewhat high-impact), as well as the speed at which Hemalayaa performs the moves, I'd recommend this only if you're intermediate or advanced when it comes to exercise.  Some bellydance background (even if it's just learning from DVDs) would also be useful.

The DVD starts with a 6 minute warm-up.  This involves a lot of work with the hips; sometimes arm movements are added as well.  There's a small amount of stretching, but it doesn't take place until after you've been moving around fairly vigorously for a few minutes (this is a good thing; it makes you less prone to injury if you warm up before stretching).  The DVD then has three 12-minute ""workouts.""  I have my doubts about a person's ability to get defined abs using this routine (after all, Hemalayaa has a feminine figure without a six-pack), although it might help a little bit if done a couple of times a week for a long time.

In the first workout, there's a lot of marching with high knees, pulsing of the pelvis back and forth, and hopping.  This workout also includes some yoga-inspired moves including downward dog, a type of push-up involving upward dog, and cat/cow stretches.  The pace is fast -- frenetic, even -- so if you need to, slow down.  You don't have to go at Hemalayaa's pace.

The second workout reminds me a bit of some of my kundalini yoga DVDs.  These moves include spine flexion, some stretches, plank position, etc.  Despite the fact that a fair amount of this section occurs on the floor, it still manages to include hopping and jumping.  For the part that's done on the floor, I can definitely see some benefit for the core/thighs/abs.

The third workout includes some bellydance moves such as shimmies and an undulating belly (hard to do correctly, by the way).  There's also a squat pulse early on during which Hemalayaa definitely does not demonstrate proper form (her knees are WAY too far out).  Later on, you do some yoga asanas and some side stretches.  There's no separate cool-down section on this DVD.

As I mentioned earlier, I think intermediate or advanced people would see the greatest benefit from this, since they'll be able to follow along.  However, the difficulty level is probably not high enough for a truly advanced exerciser to break a sweat (Hemalayaa is wearing some sort of false sheen of sweat or body shimmer lotion on her chest throughout).  You also don't focus on any one move for long enough to really feel it the next day (at least, that was the case with me).  I am now not sure who the intended audience for this DVD was -- people just starting out with exercise or people who are already pretty fit.

In the end, I wanted to like this DVD more than I ended up liking it.  The variety of moves is nice and certain aspects of the production have been cleaned up since Hemalayaa's The Bollywood Dance Workout.  Although the exercises are not difficult once you understand how to do them (when in doubt, rent the DVD first!), there's not really enough authentic instruction, especially with respect to safety.",1382313600,9,5881,4.7179236043095
3118370,4,B0013NAMM4,You won't get bored easily with Hemalayaa. I love how she teaches how to move your body while you get in shape. And I love how exotic and energetic she is. She gets me motivated!,1376438400,,178,4.114285714285714
3118371,4,B0013NAMM4,"I enjoy all of the stretching, cardio, as well as the toning.  I was never so excited before to do a push-up.  This is what my chiropractor calls ""planking"".  It certainly works for me.",1365984000,,185,4.382352941176471
3118372,5,B0013NAMM4,The set of the video is beautiful. Hemalayaa is entertaining and  makes me want to do the work-out everyday. I have had 2 children and my core is so much better!,1364169600,,161,4.193548387096774
3118373,5,B0013NAMM4,"So I bought this DVD nearly 3 years ago, and at the time when I first tried it, I did not like this workout. Back then I thought it had something to do with the DVD, but now I realize that was all me. I was lazy, a newbie to working out, and I blamed my out-of-shapeness on the DVD. 3 years later and in average shape, I have to say I LOVE this workout, and I'm so glad that I found it lying around in my basement.

First and foremost, this workout is fun. It's fast moving, but I never feel like it's TOO fast, and Hemalayaa keeps it easy to follow. There are different sequences with repeated moves that build upon one another to create larger sequences.  As someone who loves to dance, I wasn't so focused on the cardio aspect of it--I just danced. As for the less dancey stuff (washing machine, hopping around, etc.), there are your typical leg and knee raises, which target the abs (which is the point).  The segments move quickly, and I think that doing the warm up and the three segments isn't asking too much at all.  It's challenging, but it's never too difficult, and unless you're a beginner at working out like I was 3 years ago, you shouldn't reach that point where you've had enough and you just turn the thing off.

Basically, I felt compelled to write a review for this workout because I loved it so much and I was so wrong about it the first go-round.  This is one I'm definitely putting into my weekly rotation.",1363996800,5,1429,4.274074074074074
3118374,4,B0013NAMM4,"I gave this 4 stars due to it is a good work out. It's an easy flirty fun way to work out & if your guy catches you doing it he's going to love the way you move.
I do wish it had more belly dancing moves.

The product also contains a few other ethnic work outs on the DVD, to which if you have the stamina & cordination they can be fun to do to.",1358985600,,345,3.539473684210526
3118385,3,B0013NAMM4,Great moves for relaxation and stretching - didn't feel a lot of burn but still a good basic workout for the abs.,1356739200,,113,4.181818181818182
3118386,3,B0013NAMM4,"This is really more for the intermediate or advanced rather than the beginner. It assumes a knowledge of yoga, Pilates, and even belly dance. You get three separate workouts but no extras. There is plenty of variety for those who want an abdominal workout. The pace is pretty fast. I think it would be good for someone who was having a high-energy day, but it's not the sort of DVD you'd want to follow every single day.

The set is really the best of all the other DVDs Hemalayaa that I've seen, but for some reason she works out on the diagonal most of the time instead of facing the camera, which was a little annoying.

Again, there were no special features. So it's just the three workouts, nothing more.",1337558400,4,709,4.446153846153846

3118388,5,B0013NAMM4,"This was the first DVD I bought of Hemalayaa. All I can say is that I am buying ALL of her videos because I enjoyed it so much. Not once did I find myself asking ""is this over yet?"", which often happens during other DVD's. Her energy is contagious, and she makes working out fun. My abs were sore the next day, so I know it was a good workout. Try this one for sure!!!",1302480000,3,368,3.92
3118389,3,B0013NAMM4,"If you're hoping to learn dance techniques, this is not the DVD for you. However, if you want a low impact short way to work up a bit of a sweat, then perhaps you could consider Beautiful Belly.
I'm finding that DVD's with voice-over instructions aren't as helpful as the 'coach' who's talking his/her way through a workout. The voice-over on this may have been so Hemalayaa didn't have to blink/ stop smiling during this video.
Since the clips are short ( and can be combined ), this will be a convenient warm up for a while.",1300492800,,526,4.43298969072165
3118390,4,B0013NAMM4,"I love the vast majority of Hemalayaa's DVDs and this one was no exception. Its challenging and sweat-inducing, but her voice and energy carries me through. Since there are other reviews covering what is one the DVD, I'll just leave it at ""Its a blast!""

My only issues with it were that she will go into moves that could cause serious energy without explaining proper form and there is no cool down. Not only is there no cool down, but if you're doing all circuits in a row number 3 picks up the pace right before it ends. Now, there are ways around this: Don't do anything that causes pain. Watch the DVD through so you can pay attention to the form before you try it. And do your own 5-10 minute cool down after the video.",1294272000,,725,4.291970802919708

Hemplayaa is just the perfect amount of positive and inspiring without venturing into annoying perky instructor mode.  The free flowing movements are a great change from rigid fitness DVDs, and it is so basic that anyone can do it and feel sexy and empowered. I love the three different workouts and this is a great one to do alone or with girlfriends for fun. Best of all, it ROCKS your abs with no crunches. A must buy!",1290729600,,502,4.456521739130435

3118396,5,B0013NAMM4,"Hemalayaa: Beautiful Belly is a 42 minute workout DVD that focuses on moves that will help you have the belly you've always wanted: shapely, strong, and sexy!  The exercises are broken down into four sections.  There is a fast-paced cardio warm up that will help get you into the mood for the three dance workouts that follow.  Each dance workout is twelve minutes in length and will help you sculpt and tighten your abs, strengthen your core, have fun and burn calories.  The dance workouts can be done by themselves or layered and done one after the other depending on your endurance.

This is a high energy dance workout that seriously focuses on building your core strength. Hemalayaa is a very high energy instructor with a bubbling, positive attitude that will keep you motivated and moving.  During the workout you have the option of listening only to the music or to the music and instruction.  The routines are both standing and sitting so you will need a yoga mat and cushion to complete them properly.

Not all of the movements are shown to you before hand so this dance workout may be difficult for a beginner to follow.  Those with a background in belly dance or other types of dance workouts will probably have an easier time of it.  All in all, I found this a fun and motivating workout to do.

It's a pretty fast paced warm up. I had to stop before i went on to get water. but this dvd is great! not only does it work the crap out of your abs, but it makes you feel sexy.

I noticed quick results with Beautiful Belly. In fact, if I miss a workout, or do lighter workouts for a few days and feel a little bulgy, as soon as I do Beautiful Belly, my core feels much tighter and more pulled-in. Beautiful Belly is a great combination of some aerobic exercise, good stretching, and great core-building moves. The short sections mean that you can do any combination of workouts depending on how much time you have. After having done Beautiful Belly for even a week, I noticed that I walk with more confidence and I feel strong and beautiful!

No other instructor compares to Hemalayaa. It is obvious that she is knowledgeable and professional, yet she doesn't take herself too seriously. She laughs and makes little comments that you can't help but laugh at. I find myself smiling during much of the workout and I feel great afterwards. If you've had a hard time finding an enjoyable workout DVD, you can't go wrong trying Hemalayaa. I also highly recommend Bollywood Burn for a good cardio workout and also Bollywood Booty, which is a nice lighter-weight workout to alternate with Beautiful Belly.",1244246400,3,1389,4.759336099585062

The workout is fun and causes you to sweat but I question how safe it is.

The menu even has a backdrop where she is looking at you in this way that makes you want to get going!

The music was fun, the workouts were fun, and it had me standing up straight very quickly. The results are great too, so I will use this one for a long time!",1236988800,,412,4.024390243902439
3118419,4,B0013NAMM4,"This dvd is was made with high quality production such as sound, great music w/fast beat, camerawork, set design & lighting as you see on the trailers. The menu also allows you to have both Hemalayaa instruction & music or just music & the choice of warm-up (5 min) or choice of 3 workouts (12 min each) or everything.
Hemalayaa comes off very friendly & fun even with the voice over. The only problem is in all her workouts *I rent a lot*, her energy is very erratic, jumpy, in all directions at once. If you're looking for soothing or fluid movements, you won't find it here, although she does have some body awareness. This is best when you have more energy then you can deal with, like a sugar high or other reason. The other issue is that there is VERY little instruction, which lets you hear the music, but when makes doing any belly dancing, or more importantly, yoga or pilates (which the point is to have the breath go w/the movement) almost dangerous. Since there is no modifications, PLEASE go at your own pace, the bouncing cobra position if you are not careful can hurt anyone's back. (Check google for any described poses/moves I've listed to see an image.)
Warm-up - all dancing, her style is mostly Indian with some minor stretching, standing crunches, twists & some 50s mashed potatoes dancing. The pace is VERY fast, she changes pretty often after she introduces a new move & it was perfect when I was on a sugar high, but may be too erratic otherwise.
Workout 1 - raised knee dancing & with 80s ab elbow twists to knee, lunge stretching bobbing back/forth, yoga cobra pose bouncing & stretch, cat/cow breathing fast, 4 direction back/forth belly thrusts which turn to hip circles, lay on back legs spread ab crunches then pilates hundred then straight leg criss crossing while legs lower & raise, pilates double leg circles, then stand & stretch to finish.
Workout 2 - crossed leg seated torso side, fwd & corner stretching, slight dancing movement same stretching, kundalini yoga torso fwd/back fast w/fire breath (never mentions proper breathing) & torso circular grind. Down dog yoga to one legged hopping dance that turns to bangera hop dancing, grapevine style ocean wave dance. kneeling bowing up/down, kundalini yoga elbow/torso twists, kneeling bowing w/pilates modified mermaid stretches back/forth, yoga cobra, yoga modified plank on elbows, elbow plank w/ alternating quick drop knee, then plank w/drop knee & twist, cat/cow breathing, reclined yoga twist. then up to bangera hop dance again to finish.
Workout 3 - Yoga chair pose w/arm fwd/back movements, both arms swinging back/forth, twisting hips fast (washing machine she calls it), hoping shimmmy w/arms out, undulations (no instruction given), hip bumps/thrusts, walk & alternate the above dance moves. sitting straight leg fwd bend, wide leg bends to the side & fwd, back/forth fast, sitting legs fwd torso w/arms in circular movement (qi gong movement), yoga boat, yoga boat w/legs wide, sitting w/wide legs & leaning back, sitting w/legs wide & off the ground slightly, cobra. Dancing bounce with legs wide & arms swing & repeat all the previous dance movements.
Considering all the issues I raised, the reason I still give it 4 stars not 2-3 is that it IS fun if you can keep up & know the movements, and I did feel a slight soreness in my muscles the next day. I did the whole workout of course.

Hemalayaa jumps right in with a fast paced warmup and than does three separate workouts each 12 minutes long that flow into each other.  If you're strapped for time, who can't fit in 12 minutes?  I love the way she alternates the cardio dance parts with the ""not so traditional"" ab workouts. Nice stretching too.

3118422,5,B0013NAMM4,"Hemalayaa is a woman who is very comfortable in her body. She moves sensuously through a routine that combines the best of yoga and bellydance. The set is gorgeous with a beautiful tent and cushions spread across the floor (see the amazon video). Hemalayaa dances and moves on a huge Persian carpet.

If you are familiar with bellydance then you will recognize the shimmies and undulations. There are a few yoga postures like cobra, downward dog, cat/cow, boat and upward dog. The exercises are divided into three 12-minute sections, which you can play together for a full-body workout.

I felt this workout in my hips, thighs and belly. This is perfect for anyone already familiar with yoga and bellydance and may not be for beginners as no detailed instructions are given. The moves are fast paced and very sensual and you will feel the burn. I modified some of the higher impact moves so there was not as much stress on my feet and knees.

If you are bored with other routines that seem to focus on crunches then you will be happy to do this routine which emphasizes having fun instead of being structured. Hemalayaa's workouts are spontaneous and creative and you will forget you are working out they are so entertaining. I also loved the Indian music in this workout!

Some portions made me feel that I was either very uncoordinated or it needed to start out slower, so I took my time a bit more working through the exercises and practiced the moves which worked.

She is an amazingly personable instructor.

I did enjoy the dance sections enough to start looking for other dance workouts.",1231891200,,462,4.725
3352843,5,B0013NAMM4,"Hemalayaa and Bollywood is a new concept for me.  I recently purchased ""Beautiful Belly"" with Hemalayaa and will never use another work out video instructor.  She is fun with a great attitude.  The video has three different 12 minute workouts and a five minute warm up to keep boredom at bay.  I started out doing the warm up, plus one of the three circuits.  I am now able to do the full workout and my abs have never felt stronger!

Some of the dance moves require a lot of hopping and twisting so make sure your lower body joints are warmed up!  If you are a klutz (like I can be) and the moves get too complicated, try doing jumping jacks or shimmying to keep the heartrate up.  The idea is to mix cardio moves intermittenly with more specific ab work.  You might want to research some very basic bellydance moves before starting because she may use words you are not familiar with.  However, you can always just copy her movements.

IMPORTANT:  This woman is obviously highly trained and very flexible.  DO NOT attempt to make your moves look like hers unless you're very advanced.  Most people will not form the perfect ""Cobra"" or ""Downward Dog"" the first time they try.  She should talk more about your ability level, but since she doesn't, just keep it in mind!

Like the other two DVDs this one gets you sweating right away with lots of shimmies, hops, and other bhangra-inspired dance moves.  In addition to the cardio, Hema also mixes in some more traditional abdominal work (pilates-type leg circles, yoga boat pose) and some non-traditional ab work as well.

The workout starts off with a six minute cardio warm-up.  Following the warm-up are three separate twelve minute segments.  Each of these segments incorporates both dance and ab work.  If pressed for time you could do the warm-up and one of the twelve minute segments, but honestly, this workout is so much fun, once you start you don't want it to end.  My only criticism of the workout is that there is no ""cool-down"" segment, which would be nice here because the final segment ends with some vigorous belly dance moves, and definitely left me sweating.

Like Hemalayaa's other two ""dance"" workouts, ""Bollywood Dance"" and ""Bollywood Burn,"" this workout is driven by Hemalayaa's infectious spirit of fun and play.

3352866,3,B0013NAMM4,"First I'll offer some general comments that apply to the whole DVD, then I'll talk about the individual sections a little bit.  After careful consideration, I'm ambivalent about this one.  Hopefully something I write (even if you don't agree with me) will help you make a decision for yourself, though.

Pros:

*the set is beautiful
*the music, while it seems to be on endless loop, is not annoying (you get different music in each section)
*because Hemalayaa demonstrates by herself, there are no co-participants in the background who can't keep up or who are doing different moves (which is something I've seen in other DVDs featuring Hemalayaa)
*you will not need a lot of equipment (could use a cushion or pillow in one part but could also get by without it)

Cons:

*the camera work is horrible; it jumps around all the time and the end result is that sometimes when you really need to be able to see Hemalayaa's legs to see what she's doing, you can't because the camera is focusing on something else
*the voiceover can be annoying (although there is an option to turn it off); Hemalayaa talks constantly but it seems like she is offering commentary on something she's never seen before instead of giving instructions on how to do the exercises
*no discussion of proper form
*Hemalayaa spends a lot of time fiddling with her hair and pants (perhaps it would interfere with the look she was trying to create, but a ponytail and pants that don't move so much might've eliminated this aspect of things)

In terms of the exercises themselves, there's actually a nice variety; I recognized yoga asanas, a bit from Pilates, plus bellydancing and a bit of bhangra dancing.  In each of the workout segments, you do go from cardio standing up to floor exercises, then back up and down again.  So if you don't like constant changes from floor to standing positions, this DVD might not be for you.  Alternatively, you could think of it a bit like an interval workout (with exceptionally long intervals) -- get your heart rate up a bit, do some floor work, and get your heart rate up again.

On the one hand, the exercises themselves are not difficult to understand.  There's not really any complicated choreography here.  On the other hand, there is a risk of injury if you're not an advanced exerciser.  The moves are demonstrated in bare feet on a carpet.  But there is a lot of jumping and hopping, which could be problematic if you've got bad knees.  Also, whenever squat-like exercises are performed, Hemalayaa has a tendency to have her knees way out over her toes, which is not ever recommended by fitness professionals (as it can lead to injury).  Only, you are not told that this could cause knee problems.  I'd have preferred more actual instruction, including safety advice.  Because of the amount of jumping and hopping (which makes this somewhat high-impact), as well as the speed at which Hemalayaa performs the moves, I'd recommend this only if you're intermediate or advanced when it comes to exercise.  Some bellydance background (even if it's just learning from DVDs) would also be useful.

The DVD starts with a 6 minute warm-up.  This involves a lot of work with the hips; sometimes arm movements are added as well.  There's a small amount of stretching, but it doesn't take place until after you've been moving around fairly vigorously for a few minutes (this is a good thing; it makes you less prone to injury if you warm up before stretching).  The DVD then has three 12-minute ""workouts.""  I have my doubts about a person's ability to get defined abs using this routine (after all, Hemalayaa has a feminine figure without a six-pack), although it might help a little bit if done a couple of times a week for a long time.

In the first workout, there's a lot of marching with high knees, pulsing of the pelvis back and forth, and hopping.  This workout also includes some yoga-inspired moves including downward dog, a type of push-up involving upward dog, and cat/cow stretches.  The pace is fast -- frenetic, even -- so if you need to, slow down.  You don't have to go at Hemalayaa's pace.

The second workout reminds me a bit of some of my kundalini yoga DVDs.  These moves include spine flexion, some stretches, plank position, etc.  Despite the fact that a fair amount of this section occurs on the floor, it still manages to include hopping and jumping.  For the part that's done on the floor, I can definitely see some benefit for the core/thighs/abs.

The third workout includes some bellydance moves such as shimmies and an undulating belly (hard to do correctly, by the way).  There's also a squat pulse early on during which Hemalayaa definitely does not demonstrate proper form (her knees are WAY too far out).  Later on, you do some yoga asanas and some side stretches.  There's no separate cool-down section on this DVD.

As I mentioned earlier, I think intermediate or advanced people would see the greatest benefit from this, since they'll be able to follow along.  However, the difficulty level is probably not high enough for a truly advanced exerciser to break a sweat (Hemalayaa is wearing some sort of false sheen of sweat or body shimmer lotion on her chest throughout).  You also don't focus on any one move for long enough to really feel it the next day (at least, that was the case with me).  I am now not sure who the intended audience for this DVD was -- people just starting out with exercise or people who are already pretty fit.

In the end, I wanted to like this DVD more than I ended up liking it.  The variety of moves is nice and certain aspects of the production have been cleaned up since Hemalayaa's The Bollywood Dance Workout.  Although the exercises are not difficult once you understand how to do them (when in doubt, rent the DVD first!), there's not really enough authentic instruction, especially with respect to safety.",1382313600,9,5881,4.7179236043095

3352870,5,B0013NAMM4,"So I bought this DVD nearly 3 years ago, and at the time when I first tried it, I did not like this workout. Back then I thought it had something to do with the DVD, but now I realize that was all me. I was lazy, a newbie to working out, and I blamed my out-of-shapeness on the DVD. 3 years later and in average shape, I have to say I LOVE this workout, and I'm so glad that I found it lying around in my basement.

First and foremost, this workout is fun. It's fast moving, but I never feel like it's TOO fast, and Hemalayaa keeps it easy to follow. There are different sequences with repeated moves that build upon one another to create larger sequences.  As someone who loves to dance, I wasn't so focused on the cardio aspect of it--I just danced. As for the less dancey stuff (washing machine, hopping around, etc.), there are your typical leg and knee raises, which target the abs (which is the point).  The segments move quickly, and I think that doing the warm up and the three segments isn't asking too much at all.  It's challenging, but it's never too difficult, and unless you're a beginner at working out like I was 3 years ago, you shouldn't reach that point where you've had enough and you just turn the thing off.

Basically, I felt compelled to write a review for this workout because I loved it so much and I was so wrong about it the first go-round.  This is one I'm definitely putting into my weekly rotation.",1363996800,5,1429,4.274074074074074

The set is really the best of all the other DVDs Hemalayaa that I've seen, but for some reason she works out on the diagonal most of the time instead of facing the camera, which was a little annoying.

I'm finding that DVD's with voice-over instructions aren't as helpful as the 'coach' who's talking his/her way through a workout. The voice-over on this may have been so Hemalayaa didn't have to blink/ stop smiling during this video.

My only issues with it were that she will go into moves that could cause serious energy without explaining proper form and there is no cool down. Not only is there no cool down, but if you're doing all circuits in a row number 3 picks up the pace right before it ends. Now, there are ways around this: Don't do anything that causes pain. Watch the DVD through so you can pay attention to the form before you try it. And do your own 5-10 minute cool down after the video.",1294272000,,725,4.291970802919708

The free flowing movements are a great change from rigid fitness DVDs, and it is so basic that anyone can do it and feel sexy and empowered.

It's fun and easy to follow and most of all, since they're so short you can decide whether to do a lot at a time or just one or two. I also like that doing these work outs take up very little space, so you don't need a whole lot of room.

3352893,5,B0013NAMM4,"Hemalayaa: Beautiful Belly is a 42 minute workout DVD that focuses on moves that will help you have the belly you've always wanted: shapely, strong, and sexy!  The exercises are broken down into four sections.  There is a fast-paced cardio warm up that will help get you into the mood for the three dance workouts that follow.  Each dance workout is twelve minutes in length and will help you sculpt and tighten your abs, strengthen your core, have fun and burn calories.  The dance workouts can be done by themselves or layered and done one after the other depending on your endurance.

This is a high energy dance workout that seriously focuses on building your core strength. Hemalayaa is a very high energy instructor with a bubbling, positive attitude that will keep you motivated and moving.  During the workout you have the option of listening only to the music or to the music and instruction.  The routines are both standing and sitting so you will need a yoga mat and cushion to complete them properly.

Not all of the movements are shown to you before hand so this dance workout may be difficult for a beginner to follow.  Those with a background in belly dance or other types of dance workouts will probably have an easier time of it.  All in all, I found this a fun and motivating workout to do.  Hemalayaa's bubbling personality kept me upbeat and interested through the entire routine.",1273363200,4,1400,4.69672131147541

There's a warm up with three 12 min segments. so far, i can only make it through the warm up, and first segment. the warm up is actually the hardest part. i've never really had a problem with dancing, but the steps are kind of difficult, but once you figure them out they're actually pretty fun. It's a pretty fast paced warm up. I had to stop before i went on to get water. but this dvd is great! not only does it work the crap out of your abs, but it makes you feel sexy. And as far as hemalayaa goes, she's a great instructor, easy to listen to and relatively easy to follow. I hate doing regular sit ups or crunches and this is so far from that, but you'll definitely feel it!!",1269388800,7,798,3.99375

3352901,5,B0013NAMM4,"I bought this DVD with Bollywood Burn. I had never tried any of Hemalayaa's DVDs before. It was a life-changing experience. I now do one of Hemalayaa's DVDs each day and I even look forward to it, which is unprecedented for one such as me who hated physical activity.

I noticed quick results with Beautiful Belly. In fact, if I miss a workout, or do lighter workouts for a few days and feel a little bulgy, as soon as I do Beautiful Belly, my core feels much tighter and more pulled-in. Beautiful Belly is a great combination of some aerobic exercise, good stretching, and great core-building moves. The short sections mean that you can do any combination of workouts depending on how much time you have. After having done Beautiful Belly for even a week, I noticed that I walk with more confidence and I feel strong and beautiful!

No other instructor compares to Hemalayaa. It is obvious that she is knowledgeable and professional, yet she doesn't take herself too seriously. She laughs and makes little comments that you can't help but laugh at. I find myself smiling during much of the workout and I feel great afterwards. If you've had a hard time finding an enjoyable workout DVD, you can't go wrong trying Hemalayaa. I also highly recommend Bollywood Burn for a good cardio workout and also Bollywood Booty, which is a nice lighter-weight workout to alternate with Beautiful Belly.",1244246400,3,1389,4.759336099585062

My husband spends alot of time watching the video while I am wathcing it.  Atleast he is taking an interest :) When my 3.5yr old daughter tries the dance moves with me, I feel like turning the dvd off.  Not the female Indian role model I want.

The menu even has a backdrop where she is looking at you in this way that makes you want to get going!

The music was fun, the workouts were fun, and it had me standing up straight very quickly. The results are great too, so I will use this one for a long time!",1236988800,,412,4.024390243902439
3352916,4,B0013NAMM4,"This dvd is was made with high quality production such as sound, great music w/fast beat, camerawork, set design & lighting as you see on the trailers. The menu also allows you to have both Hemalayaa instruction & music or just music & the choice of warm-up (5 min) or choice of 3 workouts (12 min each) or everything.
Hemalayaa comes off very friendly & fun even with the voice over. The only problem is in all her workouts *I rent a lot*, her energy is very erratic, jumpy, in all directions at once. If you're looking for soothing or fluid movements, you won't find it here, although she does have some body awareness. This is best when you have more energy then you can deal with, like a sugar high or other reason. The other issue is that there is VERY little instruction, which lets you hear the music, but when makes doing any belly dancing, or more importantly, yoga or pilates (which the point is to have the breath go w/the movement) almost dangerous. Since there is no modifications, PLEASE go at your own pace, the bouncing cobra position if you are not careful can hurt anyone's back. (Check google for any described poses/moves I've listed to see an image.)
Warm-up - all dancing, her style is mostly Indian with some minor stretching, standing crunches, twists & some 50s mashed potatoes dancing. The pace is VERY fast, she changes pretty often after she introduces a new move & it was perfect when I was on a sugar high, but may be too erratic otherwise.
Workout 1 - raised knee dancing & with 80s ab elbow twists to knee, lunge stretching bobbing back/forth, yoga cobra pose bouncing & stretch, cat/cow breathing fast, 4 direction back/forth belly thrusts which turn to hip circles, lay on back legs spread ab crunches then pilates hundred then straight leg criss crossing while legs lower & raise, pilates double leg circles, then stand & stretch to finish.
Workout 2 - crossed leg seated torso side, fwd & corner stretching, slight dancing movement same stretching, kundalini yoga torso fwd/back fast w/fire breath (never mentions proper breathing) & torso circular grind. Down dog yoga to one legged hopping dance that turns to bangera hop dancing, grapevine style ocean wave dance. kneeling bowing up/down, kundalini yoga elbow/torso twists, kneeling bowing w/pilates modified mermaid stretches back/forth, yoga cobra, yoga modified plank on elbows, elbow plank w/ alternating quick drop knee, then plank w/drop knee & twist, cat/cow breathing, reclined yoga twist. then up to bangera hop dance again to finish.
Workout 3 - Yoga chair pose w/arm fwd/back movements, both arms swinging back/forth, twisting hips fast (washing machine she calls it), hoping shimmmy w/arms out, undulations (no instruction given), hip bumps/thrusts, walk & alternate the above dance moves. sitting straight leg fwd bend, wide leg bends to the side & fwd, back/forth fast, sitting legs fwd torso w/arms in circular movement (qi gong movement), yoga boat, yoga boat w/legs wide, sitting w/wide legs & leaning back, sitting w/legs wide & off the ground slightly, cobra. Dancing bounce with legs wide & arms swing & repeat all the previous dance movements.
Considering all the issues I raised, the reason I still give it 4 stars not 2-3 is that it IS fun if you can keep up & know the movements, and I did feel a slight soreness in my muscles the next day. I did the whole workout of course.

3352918,5,B0013NAMM4,"Great way to work abds without getting bored!  Hemalayaa jumps right in with a fast paced warmup and than does three separate workouts each 12 minutes long that flow into each other.  If you're strapped for time, who can't fit in 12 minutes?  I love the way she alternates the cardio dance parts with the ""not so traditional"" ab workouts. Nice stretching too. I look forward to adding this on a regular rotation to my exercise routine.",1235606400,2,435,4.623376623376624
3352919,5,B0013NAMM4,"Hemalayaa is a woman who is very comfortable in her body. She moves sensuously through a routine that combines the best of yoga and bellydance. The set is gorgeous with a beautiful tent and cushions spread across the floor (see the amazon video). Hemalayaa dances and moves on a huge Persian carpet.

If you are familiar with bellydance then you will recognize the shimmies and undulations. There are a few yoga postures like cobra, downward dog, cat/cow, boat and upward dog. The exercises are divided into three 12-minute sections, which you can play together for a full-body workout.

I felt this workout in my hips, thighs and belly. This is perfect for anyone already familiar with yoga and bellydance and may not be for beginners as no detailed instructions are given. The moves are fast paced and very sensual and you will feel the burn. I modified some of the higher impact moves so there was not as much stress on my feet and knees.

If you are bored with other routines that seem to focus on crunches then you will be happy to do this routine which emphasizes having fun instead of being structured. Hemalayaa's workouts are spontaneous and creative and you will forget you are working out they are so entertaining. I also loved the Indian music in this workout!
