8205843,1,B0000CBG3T,"My name is Caeser Pink. The makers of this video are guilty of illigal use of of video footage owned by my band, which is featured on the DVD.

The makers of this video believe that all people who belong to any other religion are evil satan worshippers. I believe religious intolerance is an evil force in the world and is responsibe for terrorists acts such as 9/11. We need to teach people to respect each others beliefs system if the world is ever to live in peace.

People who promote the philosophy that Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Wiccans, and followers of other religions are satanic are the true evil in our society. But rejoice, because my lawyers will soon have this DVD off the market.",1146614400,10,702,4.563492063492063
8205844,5,B0000CBG3T,"This video series like its predecessor Hells Bells 1 is another superior presentation that proofs beyond a doubt the incredible power that music has. It can be said that music is the language of languages, that out of all the arts there is none that more powerfully moves and changes the consciousness. Drawing its inspiration from the contemporary music scene and its artists, it is an expose that is both powerful and compelling to watch yet it does not resort to hysteria or sensationalism to make its point. The producers backed by ample evidence and years of research on the subject matter; put forth an overwhelming body of evidence that both skeptics and non-believers will find impossible to refute. Although many artists and musicians by their own admission admit to satanic and occultic influences in their music, many others deny it or ignore it and that's where this video series comes in. To unmask the hypocrisy and contradictions of these artists and the music industry as a whole. For many people this subject might have grown old or tiresome to hear and it brings up memories of record burning and bible thumping preachers out to condemn and cast everyone that does not agree with them to hell. But this series is the exact opposite of that. It is non preachy, it is against censorship of any kind, no one gets cast to hell, there is no record or cd burning for that matter and most important, it contains a compassionate message of hope and redemption for those that want to listen. Even for those that won't agree with its message, I guarantee that it will change the way you look at music and its artists forever. Fascinating to watch, you will not regret it.

8205845,5,B0000CBG3T,"I extremely highly recommend this video series.  I just watched it for the fourth time (It's over six hours long)and was moved profoundly again!  It shocked me, grieved me, and filled me with a passion to share it with the world.
I would not show it to children! These are actual video clips of rock (including rap, hip-hop, rave, pop, metal)videos and concerts.  It is censored, yet still very disturbing.
Every parent of children of ANY age needs to see this.  Unless you're into MTV, you will find it hard to believe what you are seeing and you will literally cry to think that children are being influenced by this stuff.
On top of this, you will learn a tremendous amount about history and philosophy.
But it's never dry or boring.  You will be glued to your seat.  My husband, who is not a christian watched the whole thing and he didn't even want to when I started, but it is fascinating.
Finally, the Christian message in this video is one of the most powerful messages I have ever heard in my life.  It is very evangelistic and will move you to radical discipleship if you're already a Christian.",1080345600,8,1105,4.522613065326633
