8267837,4,B0017YZIYG,"A people-pleasing apologetic middle-aged man with ""nice-guy syndrome"" is forced to visit the world of his unconscious when his wife asks for a divorce and he loses his home and business.  In this other world he has no choice but to confront his inner critic, symbolized as a a blind man-eating monster.  To do so he teaches himself how to use ""the sword of discernment"" by questioning what he was told by his parents, accepting that he was the family scapegoat, questioning the guilt handed down to him and by listening to his feelings.  As he does, he gains confidence and we see how his outer world transforms as his inner world heals.

A light metaphorical comedy-fantasy.  Recommended for men seeking to find their assertive selves.",1383782400,,736,4.809523809523809
