5410428,4,B001A4DT0I,"An almost gentle film, dealing with loss and recovery, choices and ghostly connections.  Appropriate viewing for All Hallows Eve, when the veil is thin.

The pace of the film is slow, but it doesn't drag.  I was never tempted to fast forward. The Welsh scenery is absolutely beautiful (note to self - if renting a cottage in the Welsh countryside don't forget your wellies!)

Anna Walton is lovely and very believable as a woman first trying to find the will to keep going after losing her husband, and then slowly connecting with the ghostly inhabitant of the cottage, to find herself again.

Stuck in the equivalent of Purgatory, Tom Wisdom's ghost is alternately sad, hopeful, desperate and finally threatening.  Excellent performance!

I've read criticisms of Nick Brimble and Tania Myers are being OTT performances, but I thought they were fine; the character of Theresa is supposed to be a tad unhinged!

My one quibble would be the ending.  Without getting into spoilers, the ending felt a bit rushed and abrupt.  Overall though an enjoyable film.  Director Axelle Carolyn does an excellent job of melding the spooky with loss and grief.",1414713600,6,1144,4.968421052631579
5410429,5,B001A4DT0I,"Soulmate sends you on an emotional roller coaster ride.  U begin to feel that u are safe, then that all changes in a turn of the head. Cunning film with  great performances.",1414627200,,173,4.375
5410430,5,B001A4DT0I,"Spooky, intriguing, and ultimately tragic with sublime and subtle performances from Tom Wisdom and Anna Walton.  Don't miss this one.",1414540800,,133,5.65
5410431,5,B001A4DT0I,"This is a beautiful, atmospheric movie with a very intimate feel. Set almost entirely within or around an isolated Welsh cottage and with a cast of only five, the film centers around Audrey, a young widow traumatised by the loss of her husband and her own subsequent failed suicide attempt,who moves to the cottage to try and recuperate in solitude. She soon begins to suspect, however, that she is not alone in the house, as her nights are disturbed by noises coming from a locked room. What starts out as fairly standard ghost story fare takes an unexpected turn when Audrey finally meets the cottage's ghost, Douglas, and instead of being afraid, befriends him. As they bond over their mutual experience of loss and suicide, Douglas becomes more and more ""real"" and able to interact with the world, and their friendship helps Audrey begin to heal.

The cinematograpy is gorgeous, making full use of the bleak but beautiful countryside and the remote, ancient cottage. The small cast adds to the intimate feel of the film and underlines Audrey's isolation (both physical and psychological). There is a real sense of underlying menace to the film and the initial build up to the revelation of Douglas' existence is genuinely spooky and atmospheric, and there were several moments that made me genuinely jump with fright. The twist in the tale, as the movie turns away from the traditional scary ghost story into a touching story of a burgeoning friendship and Audrey's hesitant recovery, is unexpected and enjoyable, and sets the audience up for the shocking resolution.

Anna Walton excels as Audrey, her grief and sorrow palpable, and Tom Wisdom is by turns intruiging, endearing and menacing as Douglas. The ghostly special effects are done well and are used sparsely yet effectively... from Douglas's ability to move objects (and explode lightbulbs!), to objects passing through him, to the lovely touch of his slight transparency when he first appears to Audrey.

This was a really enjoyable, spooky film with lots of atmosphere and a real sense of tension. It's a shame that the BBFC, as I understand it, demanded significant cuts for this DVD release and it would be interesting to see the uncut version. Either way, it's one I will definitely rewatch and I look forward to seeing more from this debut director.",1414540800,3,2319,4.956298200514139
5410432,5,B001A4DT0I,"Very good Horror-Mystery, A bit slow at first but it's because it places more emphasis on the story instead of jumping scare tactics. It's a modern day ghost story.",1414281600,,164,4.689655172413793
5410433,5,B001A4DT0I,Exceptional acting on both characters. Loved the sullen portrayal of Douglas by Mr Wisdom.,1411516800,2,90,5.5
5410434,5,B001A4DT0I,"Audrey (Anna Walton) is a recent, young widow who is plagued by the premature death of her husband. She attempts suicide to escape her pain, but her failure leads her to an even deeper depression. She escapes to a remote cottage in the Wales countryside to be in solitude and to work on her music once again. Audrey soon hears noises coming from a locked room in the cottage, only to eventually learn that it is haunted by the previous owner, Douglas Talbot (Tom Wisdom). Axelle creates suspense, both with the accompanying music score and with the camera. However, the jump-in-your-seat shocks happen when you least expect them! I admit, I flinched several times and on one occasion, actually let out a quick scream, much to my embarrassment. Instead of running away from her ghostly house mate, Audrey befriends him, much to his amazement. Their friendship develops beautifully; each one helping the other cope with the torments of their past. There is a love for one another, one much deeper than the other, though.

Anna is superb as Audrey; you feel her pain along with her, often with a knot in your stomach as she tries to make it through each day. As her tension relaxes with her new supernatural friend, you experience the warm, fuzzy feelings during their unique moments of camaraderie. Simple gestures, such as playing chess together (as Douglas struggles to move the pieces to the desired space with his energy), leaves you with a sweet smile. And when Audrey feels terror, you feel it with her.

This film is unlike any you have seen Tom Wisdom in before; his true acting colors shine through in his portrayal of Douglas. Tormented from his past, he has struggled for thirty years in loneliness as no one has ever been able to see or hear him until Audrey came along. As Audrey asks him personal questions, his silent stares make you uncomfortable, which is precisely what he was aiming for. From his sweet, gentle demeanor to his explosive anger, Tom flexes his acting chops in the film. You adore him and are completely terrified of him all in two hours. His deathly makeup only adds to the character, making him completely believable as a long-dead man.

I always enjoy twists at the end of films that I didn't see coming, which Axelle delivers perfectly. An ending that one doesn't anticipate in the least, I actually heard some quiet gasps in the audience around me (myself included). The film was dark, Gothic, hauntingly romantic, and in a word, fantastic.",1410566400,33,2476,4.766899766899767
5410435,3,B001A4DT0I,"Audrey (Anna Walton) shows up at a remote Wales cottage to get away from life. She is unsociable and melancholy. She wears a wedding ring and her wrists are bandaged. She has difficulty playing her violin and is on medications. If you haven't figured out her story in the first five minutes, you will get a full explanation later on. Of course she meets a ghost. Not as friendly as Caspar, but more like the Ghost and Mrs. Muir without the comedy.

The film is drama about coping with life and moving on. The ghost aspect is secondary. This is a ghost story for people who like Lifetime films and don't like to be scared. The film is slow and not for everyone.

5410436,5,B001A4DT0I,"I've seen my fair share of Korean dramas by now. However, this show is honestly one of the most original concepts (most just follow predictable love triangle formulas) that I have seen in awhile and the execution is great.

The basic premise is that you are watching two main characters as they stumble through their love lives in the time leading up to when they meet and realize (though there is some doubt) that they are probably soulmates. The show also follows the lives of those around them and approches the idea of destiny and soulmates from all angles. I guess what was so original to me is that the characters don't meet right away (think of it as a Korean ""How I Met Your Mother"" -- where the woman's story is shown too). What helped with the execution is that all of the characters are really three-dimensional and the fact that is neither straight drama nor straight comedy. To top it off the soundtrack is amazing (which is an area a lot of Asian dramas are lacking in). If you're still not sure convinced, watch an episode online.",1215561600,16,1045,4.529100529100529

5410463,4,B001A4DT0I,"Liked the story line, acting and cinematography. It is an eerie movie, but not in the vein of super bloody ghost movies. It has a better plot than most and a different look and feel.
 It is also NOT a""Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" movie either as some reviewers have written. It is different, that's why I liked it.
 Anna Walton is great in it, as  as Tom Wisdom is very good; he recently was in another crappy SY FY series: ""Dominion"". He is a much too good of an actor to have been in that. (Heck, we all need the money.)
I also enjoyed the location, it is actually a real place in a real village; which is one of the things that makes this an interesting movie.",1421366400,2,655,4.1015625
5410464,5,B001A4DT0I,"Good movie with a different take on a haunting.  Having lived in a few haunted houses, I think some of what this movie puts out as reasons for a haunting are not far fetched. I appreciate a ghost movie that does not rely upon what I call Spielbergian Special Effects. The ghost here is not too scary but I don't think that was the intent.  My daughter and I were walking thru an old graveyard in Upstate New York and encountered three ghosts up close dressed in Victorian era clothes and the guy actually looked like the ghost in this movie - solid and real but with skin so pale it was white - which was contrasted by brown facial hair. The only difference was that the ghosts we saw - even their lips were white and they didn't seem to see or hear us even as I said hello - we both thought they were real people dressed in old costumes - till they vanished! So the not so spooky ghost in this might not be too far off the mark - at least in some cases. Anyway, as a fan of paranormal movies, I found this refreshing. Mostly, I appreciated the dearth of special effects.",1420416000,2,1071,4.169082125603865

5410482,3,B001A4DT0I,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and I purchased the DVD. I enjoy seeing Tom Wisdom in films and tv roles and was hoping to see him take a star turn. Tom Wisdom doesn't get into this movie until after the first third is over. I really liked the idea, that a newly widowed woman might be just the right soulmate for the man who had earlier killed himself after losing his love.

The movie's pacing was slow to begin with, which would have been fine if it had been longer and developed the climax and denouement better. Instead, the romance was too short to be engaging and the ending was too obvious and disappointing. Neither lead character seemed to learn or grow much.

This movie came close to being a study of the seduction by death and the dead (ghost), but the seduction never fully unfolded. I was left feeling like I had to remake the ending again in my own mind.",1417132800,,888,4.343373493975903

Cinematography was good, as well as the acting..........thus the reason for the three-star rating.",1416700800,2,350,5.105263157894737
5410486,5,B001A4DT0I,"I am a huge fan of any director who can bring a unique vision to the big screen or even introduce a new twist to an existing concept.  Im an even bigger fan of directors who can do both.  As such, Im happy to report Axelle Carolyn has become one of my favorite filmmakers to date.  Her recent release, SOULMATE, is a poetic ghost story that brings forth many different emotions and injects a nice dose of originality into the traditional spirit narrative.

Ghost stories have always fascinated me, and I love to see movies about them.  Granted, there are hundreds of thousands of different tales about spirits, but they all seem to share a few central themes.  A couple of these are fleshed out in this film, and Carolyn does a great job of bringing them to life (pardon the pun).

SOULMATE is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The dreary Welsh landscape helps set a dark tone, and the mood continues throughout the film.  I think this aspect is a major part of what makes the movie so viable.  I don't think it would have been as powerful if the location had been somewhere in America.

The acting is superb, with Anna Walton and Tom Wisdom portraying the leads.  Ive enjoyed Waltons work since I saw her in HELLBOY 2 and MUTANT CHRONICLES back in 2008.  Wisdom is a primary character on one of my favorite new TV shows, DOMINION (on Syfy), and I really enjoy his work as well.

But the story is the real winner for SOULMATE.  It is very well written and plays out nicely onscreen.  I will not divulge any secrets, but I will say that I really liked the ending and how everything winds up.

SOULMATE is a win for me, and I recommend it.  The film is not really a horror movie, but more of a dramatic thriller.  It touches on different topics, such as love and loss, and how they can affect us both negatively and positively.  In short, its a movie that most of us can relate to in one way or another.  The film is available now, so give it a look.",1416528000,3,1951,4.319559228650138
