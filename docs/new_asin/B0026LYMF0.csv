8353214,1,B0026LYMF0,"this movie is nothing but mystical music, and pictures. it has nothing to do with any kind of code. If I could return it I would.",1362009600,,129,4.0
8353215,1,B0026LYMF0,It starts in black and white with a guy telling a weird poem while some subpar terrible special effect is going on. Then it goes to color and he's out side hugging a tree? I got a good laugh then shut it off cause it simply isn't good unless you idea of good is this,1361404800,,266,3.8545454545454545
8353216,1,B0026LYMF0,"complete and utter rubbish,  its the occult initiation as predicted, and horribly made.  on top of its isotaric views which are hericy in n of themselves.",1348876800,,154,4.884615384615385
8353217,1,B0026LYMF0,"Like one of the other people who reviewed this, I was expecting a movie explaining all the hype behind the Mayan prophecy of 12/21/12. This was a movie about some cult of people that believe we must get back in touch with nature, because we are being corrupted by media, Hollywood, and all the other crazy things around us. Now sure, that's a fine belief, but the things I saw in this movie may have in fact made me opposed to the so-called ""Ancient Code."" Half of the movie was old guys talking, and the other half was HORRIBLE special effects, repeated again and again. Lots of computerized fire. The music in the movie...UGH! It was so sad and depressing! There wasn't a single bit of light in the music, it was all dark. Probably the worst scene, and it happened about three times, was this old guy with glasses hugging a tree, looking all sad, and I was just thinking to myself, ""Oh my god, this is so dumb."" There were so many awkward pauses and scene changes in the movie. The transitions were really long. The movie would be half an hour without them. That's how it should be because trust me, no one wants to waste a full 60 minutes of their life watching this movie. Please don't. I would like to save you that trouble.

8353218,4,B0026LYMF0,I found this movie to be an example of how easily the human mind is altered in it's beliefs.  I was very entertained and like the state of mind that was perceived while watching this movie. For me it was a challenge to really dig deep to figure out my own beliefs and how they relate to the messages in this movie.  I would love to see more movies that entertain my brain as this one did.,1306972800,,388,4.025974025974026
8353219,5,B0026LYMF0,"It is what it is, A Very Beautiful Documentary on Humans and their Connections 2 their World, and on the Focus of the Heart Within. Well Done and with extra material @ the end. Well worth it 2 watch, 1 or a few times. Ty;)",1284076800,2,222,3.9555555555555557
8353220,3,B0026LYMF0,"This is as good a way as any to spend a couple of hours while the planet disintegrates and humankind self-destructs.  Some of this DVD is very amusing: check out the ""antler dancers"" ten minutes in--right out of a Monty Python skit.  Through comparative anthropology, with a touch of science, the DVD speculates that the code for our origin and existence and destruction (soon, of course) is already within us.  I wouldn't say this DVD unlocks the code, but it has a great time looking for evidence of one.  Especially if you have any New Age/Goth/Druid/Pagan tendencies, you might find this compelling viewing.",1276214400,,611,4.902912621359223
8353221,3,B0026LYMF0,Compelling documentary hosted by Philip Gardiner about the importance of rituals and traditions and their place throughout history.  Interesting and useful examples of how they are recreated today or how they have been carried forward in diverse and unexpected ways.,1252368000,2,266,5.65
8353222,4,B0026LYMF0,"I actually enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was far more entertaining than some other movies of this genre.  I don't necessarily adhere to the ""Ancient Code"" but you don't have to in order to find this movie worth your time.  I have to admit that I am a little more anxious as we approach 2012 now!!!  In the midst of this movie I did find some truth that is simple and basic. Counting on anything other than my faith and family is pointless.  Materialism is not where it is at!",1250121600,4,479,4.21978021978022
8353223,2,B0026LYMF0,"I found this DVD a large disappointment.  I expected more what with all the 2012 hype that's starting now (move over Y2K).  The treatment of the subject is too Hollywood and superficial.  The DVD is modeled after ""The Secret"", however, THAT was a much better and well done video compared to this one.  I found this boring, repetitive, and hardly worth the money or the time spent watching it.  I guess I'll donate it to someone just to get rid of it.  Such a shame, when so much could have been done with this subject.",1244332800,6,518,4.4
