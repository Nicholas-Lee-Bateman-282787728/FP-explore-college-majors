Sisters stick together, brother in-laws have no other choice. : ) I have been an avid viewer since the first season and have been waiting for the day Soul Food the series was put on dvd. It is a must have. I can't wait for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th season's dvd.",1056412800,2,377,4.094594594594595

It is important that all aspects of the lives of African-Americans are explored in movies and t.v., be it in the 'hood or suburbs.  Because like all other races and ethnic groups in America, we have different beliefs, goals, dreams, and lifestyles.  I applaud Soul Food for FINALLY letting the FACTS be known.",1055030400,2,480,4.431818181818182

It's a great show, awesome acting and just good to watch anywhere, anytime. On the plane flying home, after a long day of work; it's great to escape into Soul Food DVD's.

If you're into drama's I definitely recommend you buy the first season. Within a couple episodes you'll be hooked!

It is great to see an African American series written so well with good characters to portray the story line. With most TV shows currently being reality it's a breath of fresh air to see a drama series. And what better way than buying and watching the whole season at your leisure!

Highly recommend and will soon be purchasing season two and the movie to complete my collection.

Thanks for reading!

1878452,5,B000094J5Z,This show should still be on the air! I know its been gone way long ago but it was so well done and all the actors were so amazing! Truly!. Nothing compares to this now a days! Its sad.,1297468800,,185,3.769230769230769
1878453,5,B000094J5Z,"Well I have to say that I am so excited to finally own my own copy of the first season. I am so excited!!! My husband and I would pay extra for show time during the seasons of soul food just to watch soul food! That is the only reason we would pay extra for cable.. I remember I could not wait to get home to watch soul food with my husband. It was the show to watch!

We waited and waited to buy this series because it was sooooooooo expensive... I will say that it was worth the wait and worth the deal that we received. So I am double excited about finally owning this series. We now can watch soul food anytime and as many times as I want!

Which is great since there is really nothing good on TV...... now a days.............

As far as the series being edited, yes it would be nice if all of the scenes were left as they aired on showtime. I don't understand what the reason was for the editing. The rating on amazon states unrated.

For us, we still wanted the series as we wanted to see for ourselves what was edited out. So far we are enjoying the series the way it is, The scenes are as we remember them, we will continue to watch to see what was and was not edited out.

We will be watching this, over this holiday season and into and through out the new year.. Just in time for the holidays!

We were looking for something to watch for the holidays and every year we usually add a few new DVD's to our collections. This makes a great addition!

I don't want to give any spoilers away, all I can say is that we were hooked on this series the first time we watched!

And now to the great part of it all. We only paid $8.00 plus tax for the first series and $9.00 plus tax for the second series! What a deal!

I like the cast of the series better then the movie especially Nicole Ari Parker who portrays Teri Joseph, an upscale attorney. Nicole Parker does a better job of portraying Teri Joseph as a total human being with all dimensions of emotions in dealing with her personal and work problems. I especially like her interactions with Boris Kodjoe which comes across as realistic. I also feel the other members of the cast were much better in their respective rolls then the movie cast.

I bet most, if not all of the stars of this show could use a steady gig again. BRING BACK THIS SHOW!! (And, in the meantime, release the rest of the episodes on dvd.

I called them as well and they claim it is coming out but that they are dealing with some clearance issues...I feel like the fans are getting the run around...so I say still campaign for a release! Feel free to copy my letter and add your personal spin to it and send it to the address listed. If you prefer the more direct approach as well -- Call at 323.956.5000 -- press 0 and ask for the Home Entertainment department -- leave a message --- they will call you back -- that's how I heard about the ""clearance"" issue. The guy I spoke to was nice and optimistic about a release...so hopefully a release will in fact occur SOON! I have been told this is the most requested DVD.  Even some of the operators at Paramount are waiting for a release. Go figure!

[...]

Yes, it's that time again for you to hear yet another request for the release of ""Soul Food"" - Seasons 2-5.

First, I would love to know what is taking so long? I've been told that the sales of the first season were not up to par, so that's why the second season has been delayed THREE years. But, perhaps it's not the series; perhaps you need a better marketing plan when it comes to promoting the ""Soul Food"" DVD (i.e., you could have deleted scenes, commentaries, bloopers, free gift certificates to certain Soul Food restaurants, the options are endless). Or, perhaps the price was too high for the first season - I've heard that from consumers as well. Whatever it was, clearly there is a demand for the series, especially since it has been added to basic cable (i.e., BET (but realize this is the edited version - which takes away the passion of the series)). Furthermore, I know that you get tons of emails, letters, and calls requesting the release of the second season. Plus, you can go on certain message boards and find people discussing their frustrations with regard to the delay. There are even petitions up [...] So the demand is there!

Recently, I've been told that there is a ""clearance"" issue with guest stars who were featured on the series, so that's why there's a delay. But wouldn't that be an issue that was cleared when they signed on to play their roles on the show? Wouldn't they have signed away their ""likeness"" then? Just curious.

Could there be a problem with not wanting to promote a positive image of African-Americans? Is there a problem with the image of a black family sticking together through adversity? I mean, black comedies surely do not have a problem being released. In fact, both seasons of the show ""That's My Mama"" was released and that show was not and is not nearly as popular as ""Soul Food.""

In the end, I'm hoping the release of the subsequent seasons is well on its way. If not, that would be a terrible loss to your viewing audience. Entertainment needs to showcase more positive images of African-Americans, ""Soul Food"" did just that. I would think your company would support such a movement. Thank you and I look forward to the release.",1146700800,28,3066,4.543478260869565

Soul Food the series certainly has no flaws and more than often the cast surpasses the talents of the great actors who played their character first. What I love the most about Soul Food is that it showed us Intelligent and successful people and it didn't get canceled after the first season.

Any how It would be great if some one could help to get the other seasons released, just point me in the right dirrection.",1140998400,,563,3.9473684210526314

This family has many of the same problems and crisis' that almost every American family faces (Black, White, Hispanic and Asian).  It's well-written, well-acted, and it lets its characters be vividly real. It reminds us that not all African Americans are living in desperate poverty; we are just like many other American families. Soul Food explores storylines that many network series delve into with predominantly Caucasian casts, such as class, crime, religion, sex, but the networks rarely show them from an African American perspective. Soul Food almost never made race a central concern but it surely never tried to cover up the fact that race plays an important role in these character's lives.

While it focuses on some issues unique to people of color, the main focus of the show is on the strength, power, and importance of family; which is a lesson for all people.  I am shocked and disappointed that after waiting patiently for close to 3 years, Paramount seemingly refuses to recognize the many fans of the series that span the color spectrum, and thus have failed to release Seasons 2-5 on DVD.  Soul Food, at only 5 seasons, was the longest African American drama on television, if only for that reason I would think it deserves the accolades given so easily to other shows like the Gilmore Girls ( a lesser watched gem that managed to have two seasons on DVD).  Additionally, they have priced the DVD so unrealistically that it makes it hard for fans to buy it and gives Paramount a reason not to put out the other seasons.

As a Black husband, father, teacher, and son, Kenny's character moves me beyond measure, for here I see my - and many, not all, Black men's - realities, fears, hopes, dreams, and joys mirrored on the screen.

1878584,5,B000094J5Z,"Every once in a while I would be channel surfing and come across Soul Food on Showtime until once I stopped and watched an episode. I got the first season on DVD right away after that. This is a greatly written series, which presents the events in the life of a normal family. The viewer gets to see all kinds of emotions among the different characters, from love to rage, hope to disenchantment, trust to suspicion, etc.
Big Mama held the Joseph family together, and when she died they went through a rough patch, events that are shown in the movie that originated the series. Now, the three sisters and their loved ones have to fend off by themselves through this maze called life. Teri (Nicole Ari Parker) is the successful lawyer, who spends most of her time trying to make partner and who is going through a divorce after her husband cheated on her with her own cousin. Bird (Malinda Williams) is having a baby in the first episodes of the series and looks forward to life with her husband Lem, who has supposedly rehabilitated after being in prison for a short period of time. But Lem is having trouble getting a ""regular"" job, so his options are running out and he may be forced to go back to his previous activities. The third sister, Maxine, is a stay-at-home mom, with three kids, married to Kenny, owner of his own business. Her oldest kid Ahmad, who is entering into adolescence, is one of the central characters of this story. He is the one that brought the family together in the movie, and now he has the role of telling the story and sharing his thoughts with the audience.
All of these different characters have their problems and they usually find in their loved ones the support necessary to resolve them. In several episodes we get to see Big Mama again in the recollections of the different characters about how her wisdom and love led them through life. I wish I had the chance to see the following seasons on DVD, but sadly it seems that is not going to happen, so I will probably have to catch these episodes on TV.",1087689600,30,2039,4.483870967741935
1878606,5,B000094J5Z,"I was so happy when finally the word came out that Soul Food's first season was being released.  I did not subscribe to Showtime when it initially aired and missed the entire season.  I was however, very troubled by the high price of the set.  On every dvd site I've checked, Soul Food's price for a 5 dvd set surpasses other hour long dramas with 6 dvd's (eg The Sopranos, Once & Again, Felicity).  I suspected that the price was set high to DISCOURAGE purchases and in effect justify the non-release of subsequent seasons.
Anyway, I bought a used set and am quite satisfied with it but hope that if they release Seasons 2-5, they keep the price in line with other series ($35 for a 5 dvd set is reasonable, $80 IS NOT!!!!!)
And to that poster from the lovely, racially enlighted state of KY: you seem to be someone who did not really watch this series and is a caucasian who does not know any African-Americans personally.  It is 2004 - we are doctors, lawyers, professors, investment bankers, business owners - in other words, we are just like you.  So why is it unbelievable to see a family where there is a lawyer, two business owners and a stay-at-home mom venturing out into the workplace?  Would it have been more believable to you if they were all unemployed & on welfare, selling drugs and shooting each other??

In the next season I hope that Teri and Dameon gets married and have a baby, I also want to see that Kenny still have feelings for Teri again to, now that would be real good, but I don't want to see the family go crazy. I want to see whole new level of Soul Food, and again I thank the producers and everyone who put there heart into this season, because it really has change me, and I can't wait until season 2. Oh yeah, everybody will soon know me because I'm working on a demo , just me and I'm about to blow up and I'm calling my demo "" Divine Soul"" . Just look out . Thanks again , Soul Food.",1059004800,,1313,3.93609022556391

I feel that this is an historic show for our people and we should support it by buying it!  It shows a different aspect of Black America that is not represented on main stream media.",1058227200,,320,4.5964912280701755
1878614,3,B000094J5Z,"I Love Soul Food, it is a great show  I am upset about this huge price of 89.99 geez your not getting anything for it execpt the 20 episodes, I mean does Tracy or Babyface need that much money, cmon who is going to pay that kind of money just for the show no bonus nothing  let me repeat  JUST THE SHOW, who's idea was this because I don't think anyone gonna paid that I think that's why we have dvd burners.  Please Paramount, Tracy or Kenneth Please don't sell something that you know that is not going to make any profit it will just be sitting in the store!!!!!!!!",1056672000,5,568,4.136363636363637
1878615,5,B000094J5Z,"I've been to different types of African-American movies and have seen the positive and negative potrayals of African-Americans.  I always thought, ""When is Hollywood going to show something closer to home that I know about?""  When SoulFood came out I said, ""It's about time!""  I loved the movie and had a grandmother similar to Momma Joe, with the exception that she had my brother and I in church almost 24-7.  The movie was good, but I feel that the series was even better.  Some of those things really do happen in life.  Out of all of the characters I think Lem is the most real.  Once you've been to jail, it's hard to get out and find work.  For those who say that Soul Food is a fairy tale, then I feel sorry for you.  It's obvious that you didn't grow up with the type of family stability portrayed in the series.  But most African-Americans from down South have grown up with Momma Joes around them all of their lives.  I highly recommend this series, because it is educational, informative and entertaining for all adults, young and old.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of Season 2 on DVD.  Even though I've seen most of it, I'll be able to see it again and again and again...",1056585600,6,1191,4.433179723502304
