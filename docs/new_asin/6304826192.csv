940651,4,6304826192,"Symbolically, WrestleMania XIV was the turning point for the WWF's current success.  Mike Tyson's presence garnered a lot of publicity for the company, and the crowning of Steve Austin as WWF champion ushered in the  new ""WWF Attitude"" era.  Though there were no four star matches  on the show, almost every match was very good.  The best match was the  Austin-Shawn Michaels title match, which is amazing considering Austin was  still recovering from his neck injury, and Michaels had a very bad back.  Other highlights include Kane tombstoning Pete Rose, a surprisingly good  wrestling performance from Sable, a solid HHH-Owen Hart match, and a wicked  brawl between The New Age Outlaws and Cactus Jack & Terry Funk.",912729600,,718,5.05982905982906

In my opinion, a purty stupid opener, the only good part was to see LOD (for all u non-wrestling watchers out there, Legion of Doom- A.K.A. Road Warriors) come out of their b---h fit looking tougher, badder, and to see Sunny with them?? w00t!! That was stunning (I mean she was stunning...durr) 4/10

Winner(s) L.O.D. 2000: last eliminating The New Midnight Express

WWE/WWF Light Heavyweight Championship Match

Taka Michinoku (Champion) vs. Aguila

A high flying match that pitted a young, Mexican Rey Mysterio wanna-be with a world class Cruiserweight, a cool match with it's share of high flying bumps, and hits, the only problem is King saying Brian Christopher can whoop both these 2 men at the same time....yeah right....8/10

Winner: Taka Michinoku by pin (retains WWE/WWF Light Heavyweight Championship)

WWE/WWF European Championship Match

Hunter-Hearst Helmsley (with Chyna) vs. Owen Hart

The added twist with Sgt. Slaughter handcuffing himself to Chyna worked...till the very end, great, physical match, that saw HHH not going for Owen's injured ankle till the end, weird, not the HHH I know...KING, STOP DISSING THE HART FAMILY YOU JERK!!!! Great match...7.5/10

Winner: HHH by pin fall (Retains European championship)

Intergender Tag Team Match

""Marvelous"" Marc Mero n' Sable vs. Luna Vachon n' Goldust

The storyline was controversial and interesting, but im talking about the match, it was mildly interesting, hell, Sable would have been better off by herself, Mero didn't do squat, neither did Goldust, Sable did most of the @#^ kicking in this match, most of it to Luna (I didn't know Luna was related to Mad Dog Vachon, I learn things everyday....) BTW, this Sable's Pro Wrestling debut, a very impressive in-ring debut for Sable in this match, pulling off a TKO (Marc Mero's signature move) and her move, The Sable Bomb, as I said... MILDLY interesting... 7/10

Winner(s) Marc Mero and Sable by pin

WWE/WWF Intercontinental Championship Match

Rocky Maivia (The Rock) (Champion) vs. Ken Shamrock

Short, boring, tedious match here, a waste of my time, but a good and controversial ending, Shamrock had the match won, and did not let go of the Ankle Lock and got himself DQed because of his short temper, moron......2/10

Winner: The Rock by reverse decision (Shamrock did not let go of the submission hold after the bell...Rock retains WWE/WWF IC Championship)

WWE/WWF Tag Team Championship Match

Dumpster Match Rules

Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie (Mick Foley and Terry Funk) vs. The New Age Outlaws (B.A. Billy Gunn and Road Dogg Jesse James) (champions)

An interesting hardcore oriented match between two good tag teams, the rules of the match are simple, the first team to put their opponents into the dumpster, and close the lid shut wins the match and most importantly, the WWE/WWF Tag Team Titles, a great match with its share of ladders, chairs, dumpster bumps, and backstage action...after plenty of Hardcore action, Funk and Foley put the NAO (New Age Outlaws) into a dumpster located backstage and won the match, but the following night on Raw, Funk and Foley were cheated out of the titles because ""the champions weren't put in the right dumpster, the one located outside the ring..."" uhhh, ok.......a dumpster is a dumpster, who cares where it is and where they put them, they won, fair is fair.....superb match none the less......9.75/10

Winner(s) Funk and Foley (new WWE/WWF Tag Team Champions) (decision later reversed on Raw the following night...)

Kane vs. Undertaker

Review Coming Soon...

WWE/WWF Championship Match

""HBK"" Shawn Michaels (accompanied by DX: HHH and Chyna) vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Mike Tyson: Special Enforcer)

ok, until the end, Mike Tyson had no importance out there at ringside, he did nothing, as I said, until the end, but none the less a great match, HBK was his usual, resilient self in this contest, at the end, SCSA blocked a Sweet Chin Music from HBK to spin him around and give him a Stone Cold Stunner and a 1-2-3 count by Tyson, Tyson then stood up for himself, ripping the DX shirt, knocking HBK cold, and placing the Austin 3:16 shirt over HBK, this was HBK's last match before his comeback in 2002 this match didn't live up to the hype, but the ending was worth it 7.25/10

Winner: Stone Cold Steve Austin by pin (New WWE/WWF Champion)

Overall Score of Wrestlemania XIV: 8.75/10

The 3rd best wrestlemania I have ever seen! Here are the results with a short review:
Match 1)Leigon Of Doom won the 15 team battle royal
This was a great battle royal! It was the first ever team battle royal. The Legion of Doom won when both men eliminated the new Midnight Express. ****
Match 2)Light Heavyweight Champion Taka Michinoku def. Aguila
The best Light Heavyweight Title match I have ever seen! The 15 year old Aguila showed us all one of the best performances I have ever seen in a huge match like this. The whole match was filled with highflying moves! *****
Match 3)European Champion Triple H def. Owen Hart
This was a good match with a cheap ending. If it wasn't for Chyna, Owen would of had the match won! Triple H wins again with a pedigree. He is now 2 and 1 at Wrestlemania. *** 1/2
Match 4)Marc Mero and Sable def. The Artist formerly known as Goldust and Luna
It should have been before the European Title match but it was worth watching! Sable proves that she can do moves better than Marc Mero! Luna and Goldust are just both weird! ***
Match 5)Intercontinental Champion The Rock def. Ken Shamrock by dq
A great match except for the ending when Shamrock wouldn't let go of the ankle lock submission even though the Rock passed out. After The Rock was put on a stretcher, he was demolished by Shamrock! *****
Match 6)Dumpster match for the Tag Team Championship:Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie def. Jessy James and Billy Gunn
A great tag team match! Espically with the dumpster match added! Chainsaw Charlie and Cactus Jack are crazy! Crazy to demolish the New Age Outlaws! The ending was backstage when Chainsaw Charlie got in a lifting truck and lifted up the NAO and dumped them into the dumpster and then lifted up the dumpster! *****
Match 7)Undertaker def. Kane
The best match on this card! A great ending where Kane tombstoned Undertaker a few times but never got the 3 and them Undertaker hit a humongus tombstone and got the 3 count! Great match! *****
Match 8)WWE Title:Stone Cold Steve Austin def. Shawn Michaels
Both men were in serious pain during this match with Austin's knee and Michael's back! Austin was getting the crap beat out of him because Mike Tyson was letting anything go for Michaels. It came to a shocking ending when Tyson turned on Michaels and counted a super fast 123 after Austin hit the stunner! Great Match! *****

940758,4,6304826192,"They say the older WrestleManias are better, and now I believe it. This was sheer fun and frolic as Kane battles Undertaker, Shawn (BadBoy) Michaels goes up on Stone Cold, and Mike Tyson jumps into the mix.
Heck Undertaker's entrance alone made the tape worth it. I can think of many a fellow Sci-Fi/Fantasy fans who'd get a kick out of it. Yes, the storylines are hokey, JR & the King cornier than ever, Jennifer Flowers & Pete Rose were useless. However, the fan reactions and the athletics are top notch.
Pay special attention to the Light Heavyweight bout. Those two make Rob Van Dam look like a dead weight. And Mick Foley/Terry Funk bring the funk in their match up.
There's a press conference at the end of the video with Mike Tyson. It had me in stitches.",1065312000,,763,4.496402877697841

And what would Wrestlemania be without some high-profile celebrities. On this one, you get Mike Tyson in a high-profile role as the ""enforcer"" of the main event as well as appearances by Pete Rose, Jenniffer Flowers, and a few others.",1062288000,,731,4.630769230769231

 Tag team battle royal for #1 contenders for tag titles
not a good match but it was just the 1st match, LOD won.
 Light heavyweight championship
 Taka M. vs Augula
Suprisingly one of the best matches at WM-14, the match had great pace and many high flying moves. It was a very exciting match and is certainly worth watching.
 European Championship
 Owen Hart vs Triple H
Not a bad match either, of course HHH had to cheat to win but it showed him at a time right before he'd explode into a huge superstar, and of course Owen Hart put on one of his great performances, little did we know a little more than a year later we'd lose him.
 Marc Mero/Sable vs Goldust/Luna
This wasn't too bad of a match, Sable really stole the show in this one and got the win.
 Intercontinental championship
 Rock vs Ken Shamrock
The show was going smoove and this match had to pop up, on paper it looked like a good match but turned out to be a terrible and boring matchup. Rock tapped to the anklelock, but Shamrock continued to put the hold on after the match and was DQed. Terrible way to end a match a WMania.
 Tag Team Championship
 Dupster Tag Match
 New Age Outlaws vs Cactus Jack/Chainsaw Charlie-(Terry Funk)
Very hardcore, a terrific match, they powerbomb each other from the ring into the dupster,fall from the ladder into it,and use a forklift backstage, the best hardcore match in WrestleMania history.
 Undertaker vs Kane
This is the best match on WM-14, for two big people the match wasn't slow and had a lot great points. The Undertaker's enterance is really cool because of the lights and the fire torches also. Lots of powermoves are executed, but the best thing is when Undertaker dives over the ropes gracefully towards Kane and Kane moves and directs him into the table. In the end Kane and 'Taker trade tombstones and after 3 on Kane 'Taker wins it.
 Main Event-WWE Championship
 Shawn Michaels vs Stone Cold
 Special enforcer- Mike Tyson
I thought this match would be and instant classic with HBK's arial ability and Austin's streetfighting skills, I didn't care about Tyson, I wanted to see a good wrestling match not him. The match was set up great with a good hype following it. Austin came out in his usual 3:16 vest and HBK came out in one of his great looking flashy suits, and at this 'Mania HBK looked most in shape for his match, at that time HBK was with DX so they came out with him. The match that followed wasn't a bad match but was below HBK normal performances, due to his back being hurt. Even with a hurt back Shawn outperformed Austin and landed the elbow drop, but missed the Sweet Chin and got the stunner where Tyson counted 1-2-3. Overall this was a pretty good 'Mania and it can be remembered as the birth of Austin's title run and the end of Shawn Michaels(or so we thought)",1058313600,,2818,4.487279843444227

940774,5,6304826192,"In my opinion the 2nd best wrestlemania of all time. This is a very entertaining show with all wrestlers showing the world what they are capable of.
It starts off with a 15 team battle royal,thats right 30men in the ring striaght away.
Taka vs Aguila in a nice show of highflying and a little lucha libre. This match is fast paced and keeps you wondering what are they planning to do next?
Mixed tag match:Mero & Sable vs Goldust & Luna. A decent Tag team match with sable showing she did have skills.
HHH vs Owen Hart: This was a nice solid matchwith Chyna getting into the action at the end. Although nothing to special.
Rock vs Shamrock:This was a cool match and was beter than there match at the rumble. I like the rock matches around 98 and start of 99, now is matches look all the same. Rock gives Shamrock a grueling chair shot right to his face. A dissapionting descion at the end of the match, especially for Shamrock.
Tag Team Dumpster Match. Terry Funk & Cactus Jack vs New Age Outlaws.
This was a cool match, although you would think Cactus Jack and Terry Funk would take abit more bumps (knowing they wrestled classics in ECW) ah well they still did some cool stuff. The bump of the night was in this match taken by terry funk as the new age outlaws powerbombed him in the dumpster and Funks back bouncing off the edge of the dumpster which causes the biggest blood blister you will see during the match. Cactus and Billy Gunn also fell off the ladder into the dumpser which really doesnt stand out now but still cool.
The much anticpated match Undertaker vs Kane which did not dissapiont.it was there 1st match ever against each other. It took a few tombstones to get Kane down. A nice table spot by Undertaker as he leaps over the top rope through the table. This was a nice powerful match.
Main Event : WWF CHAMPIONSIP : SHWAN MICHAELS vs STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN.
This match was match of the night. A fast paced match with a lot of ooo's and aaahhhhhhh's. The most powerful whip i seen from Austin and taken by HBK, beleive me you will know when it hits. It is a back and forth contest in which what is gonna hit 1st? Stunner or Sweet Chine Music?
As you can all see this is one of the greatest shows WWF has put on. It was also Shawn Michaels last match and it was a good one too.
I recomend this to any wrestling fan, as it is a show you won't get sick of.

Ken Shamrock VS The Rock: For the IC Title. Nice bout with lots of action, but it is a little bit short. They had better matches. 6.5/10
Cactus Jack/Chainsaw Charlie VS New Age Outlaws: Dumpster/Tag Titles match. Best match of the evening, with lots of hardcore and with some cool bumps. It goes backstage too. 10/10
Kane VS Undertaker: very intense match. After 6 months of waiting, the 1st confrontation between Undertaker and Kane is a very entertaining match. Kane dominates most of the match. 7.5/10
Stone Cold VS Shawn Michaels: WWF Title is up for grabs. Michaels fights a good match, even with his back injury. Tyson isn't as close to the action as was hyped. Good match, but it is predictable. 8/10

7879633,4,6304826192,"Wrestlemania XIV was a huge event that took place at the Fleet Center in Boston. There are many memorable moments from this Wrestlemania. To me there wasn't a bad match on card at all. All of the matches are pretty watchable which makes up a good event to watch all the way through.

1. 15 Team Battle Royal for the #1 Contendership
A very good opener and battle royal which features 2 teams of the nation, headbangers, gowins, too cool, and others. The new L.O.D. makes a surprise return which was the highlight of the match. Good opener. 3.5/5

2. WWE Light Heavyweight Championship
Taka Michinoku vs. Aguila
A very good and high flying match between these 2 light heavyweights. There were some good aerial moves and also some good wrestling moves used as well. Very good match with light heavyweights. King also makes references about how his son could beat both of these guys, so listen for that. 4/5

3. European Championship
Triple H w/ Chyna vs. Owen Hart
Now the stimpulation to this match was that Chyna had to stay handcuffed to St. Slaughter through the duration of the match. This match just became fight in the beginning with Hart just whelling on Triple H. Hart even utilizes a standing hurricanrana on Triple H. Triple H would then get the advantage and start working on the injured ankle of Hart. Chyna would eventually get lose and give Hart a low blow to allow Triple H to deliver the pedigree on Hart. Just a good all around match nevertheless. 4/5

4. Mixed Tag Match
Marc Mero & Sable vs. Goldust & Luna
Sable from the beginning was ready for a fight. I believe the 2 women made the match more than the 2 men. Sable wins with the TKO on Luna. 2.5/5

5. Intercontinental Championship
The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock
To me, this match was much better then their match at the Rumble. The match had more brawling and some more wrestling. Some good outside ring action in the beginning. And just like the Rumble, Shamrock initially wins the match but gets the decision reversed after Shamrock wouldn't let go of the ankle lock. 3.5/5

6. Dumpster Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship
The New Age Outlaws vs. Cactus Jack & Terry Funk
This was just a good hardcore tag match. chairs, the dumpster, cooking sheets, and even a ladder all come into play. Some good spots with the dumpster. Funk gets powerbombed into the dumpster by the Outlaws. The match would end in the locker room area. Great first match of it's kind. 4/5

7. Undertaker vs. Kane w/Paul Bearer
This was a great match between these so called brothers and the build up towards the match was just pheonomenal as well. Kane basically just dominates the undertaker during the majority of the match. Kane utilizes some wrestling holds to wear down the undertaker in this one. some good out of the ring action. Both men displays some great agility in this one. Undertaker kicks out of a tombstone that kane delivers, but it takes 3 tombstones to put away Kane. Pheonomenal match! Listen for Pete Rose's red sox jokes before the match, they're pretty funny. 5/5

8. WWE Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels
Great match even though Michaels back was injured throughout the whole match due to the casket match at the Rumble. Some good brawling on the outside. Michaels utilizes the figure 4 in this one. Some good reversals. Good overall match. Austin would counter sweet chin music and then hit the stunner to begin the Austin 3:16 era. Great main event. 4.5/5

This was a good wrestlemania. I'll say this Wrestlemania is most likely in the top 10, if not in the top 5, but that is just my opinion. Great Wrestlemania nevertheless. I recommend yall picking this one up.",1214956800,2,3658,4.624036979969183
7879634,5,6304826192,"This is one of the best WrestleManias that I have seen and that is not only the fact that I actually went to this event in my hometown of Boston but this was one of the better cards that we had seen during this era. One thing you can't help but notice was that you could tell that Attitude Era was really starting to evolve here with the atmosphere here being much more different than the previous WrestleManias.

15 Team Battle Royal. The winners of this match would receive a title shot at the Tag Team titles the next month at Unforgiven. This was one of those matches that was just good for what it was as the real highlight here was the return of the Legion of Doom with a new look & a new manager in Sunny to receive one of the loudest pops of the night. Other moments include Lawler constantly putting his own son over, the continuation of the Bradshaw/Windham feud & the end of the Road Warriors feud with the Godwinns.

WWF Light Heavyweight Champion Taka Michinoku vs Aguila. Jim Ross quoted this match perfectly when he said ""that someone should notify Logan Airport"" because these two put on a great match with so many high, risk moves & high-flying that really showed the possibilities that this division had if given the proper push but this was certainly a highlight for it's time.

WWF European Champion Triple H vs Owen Hart. The stipulation here was that Chyna was going to be handcuffed to Sgt. Slaughter to prevent her from interfering in the match. This was a really good match as Owen & Triple H worked well together with Triple H even working on Owen's injured ankle with Chyna not really becoming a factor till the end where she not only got even with Slaughter but took care of Owen as well.

Sable & Marc Mero vs Goldust & Luna. For those wondering, this was the third mixed tag team match in WrestleMania history & was a better match than anyone anticipated going in. The crowd was pro-Sable throughout the match with Sable being very aggressive throughout the match & even doing moves that she had never done before to Luna like a powerbomb & even using Mero's TKO to get the victory.

Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs Ken Shamrock. This was mostly just Shamrock dominating most of the match & even winning the match by submission but not before taking a sick chair shot at the hands of The Rock to the point where Shamrock snapped again to the point that the decision was reversed back to The Rock. However, one moment to check out was when the leader of the Nation, Faarooq refused to help The Rock when he was in the anklelock.

Dumpster Match: WWF Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs Cactus Jack & Chainsaw Charlie. The rules here was to win the match, you have to put your opponents in the dumpster & close the lids. This was hardcore to say the least as these two teams beat the hell out of each other with various weapons being used like a ladder, pans, stop signs etc with one moment to look out for when Billy Gunn & Cactus Jack were knocked off the ladder from the middle of the ring all the way down into the dumpster. They went backstage using more weapons before Jack & Charlie outsmarted the Outlaws to win the titles.

The Undertaker vs Kane. This was their first match & to this day, I still regard this one as their best encounter as this was one of the best ""big man vs big man"" matches in WrestleMania history. This match also told a good story in which Kane was the relentless monster that Taker is known to be in the past to the point where he took more of a beating here than he ever did before to the point where Taker took a dive to the outside but landed on the spanish announce table. Great match between these two as Taker sealed the deal after the third tombstone.

WWF Champion Shawn Michaels vs Stone Cold Steve Austin w/Special Enforcer Mike Tyson. This was the match that began Austin's era in the WWF along with the final in-ring performance of Shawn Michaels...for at least four years anyways. This was a great back & forth match with both men's different styles really complimenting each other well with extra credit to HBK for putting on this type of performance with a broken back that really showed it's effect throughout the match. Tyson wasn't a factor till the end to allow Austin to win his first WWF title that lead to the aftermath of Tyson knocking out Shawn in the middle of the ring.

In the end, this was one of those WrestleManias where there wasn't a bad match on the card & while some matches might have disappointed (Rock/Shamrock for example), there is nothing really bad here with standout matches along the way. I highly recommend this one as I felt this was one of the best WrestleManias that I have seen.",1208908800,,4696,4.432213209733487
7879635,1,6304826192,"WrestleMania is called the granddaddy of all wrestling PPV's. Well they do make some good moments, I find them to be a little misleading. Only recently has WrestleMania been putting on subpar PPV's ever since this one. The year before was a good WrestleMania highlighted by the Hart-Austin submission match that fans will never forget. This Austin-Michaels ppv ushered in a new era but up until WrestleMania X7, WrestleMania would put on Raw like matches for there biggest PPV of the year.

Tag Team Battle Royal: LOD returns and wins this very confusing battle royal. I don't even remember half the teams that where in this event. I like how the King puts over his own son, Brain Christphor, in this match.

Take Michinoku VS Agulia: Good, fast paced match. Again Lawler puts over his son after Michinkoku wins. WWE cruiserweight division never amounted to much.

Triple H VS Owen Hart: A good match but Chyna interferes and ruins what was a good match.

Marc Mero @ Sable VS Luna @ Golddust: I guess Golddust was always a weird guy. This match didn't really do much. Could have been saved for Raw.

Ken Shamrock VS The Rock: I use to love Shamrock. The Rock screws Shamrock out the IC title, which was really the only bad part to it.

Cactus Jack and Terry Funk VS N.A.O: A good street fight. Funny how over N.A.O were considering only Billy Gunn knew how to wrestle.

Kane VS Undertaker: Good match. One of the best on the card.

Austin VS Michaels: Triple H and Chyna are thrown out after a few minutes, much to the fans delight. I never knew how Mike Tyson brought in ratins for WWE but I guess it did. Austin wins and ushers in his era, as Michaels would retire for a few years. Good match.

Decent PPV with only a few highlights. WWE would return to WrestleMania from in Houston.",1196035200,,1786,4.521739130434782
