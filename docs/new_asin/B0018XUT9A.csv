I love this series and how gentle but challenging the are. This is the best go to video if you have never tried yoga before!! Love it",1475625600,,296,3.8688524590163933
8271333,4,B0018XUT9A,I love anything by the FIRM!  But only buy this if you've never done yoga or are very new to yoga.,1466380800,,98,3.6666666666666665
8271334,5,B0018XUT9A,"This yoga DVD has been great for me.  I am recovering from CRPS (nerve damage) in my foot and this workout is effective - yoga poses are done while sitting, lying on back, side, stomach ,ect.  They are effective yet not too difficult.  I would recommend it to others that want a good, beginner's level work out that doesn't require standing.  Benefit is very good flexibility.",1466380800,2,376,4.651515151515151

8271339,5,B0018XUT9A,"I own 17  fIRM videos and love every one. This is more of stretching video than a yoga, which is exactly what I was looking for. Allie is my favorite instructor.",1381708800,2,161,4.193548387096774
8271340,4,B0018XUT9A,"I got this DVD as part of the Yoga Beginners Kit.  I ordered the kit because I wanted the equipment; I wasn't expecting much from this DVD, figuring was just a throw in.  I really like this yoga workout when I need a basic, full-body stretch.

Why I like this workout:  As I said, it is a great stretch for the whole body.  That is why I keep coming back to it.  I like the mirrored instruction, and that they use 3 instructors so that you can adapt for various levels of flexibililty.  They incorporate use of the yoga block (for inflexible beginners, like me) and the yoga strap (great to enhance stretching).  Allie keeps the workout in balance.  For example, if the stomach muscles are worked, the next move is to stretch the stomach muscles.  Allie explains things very well and moves along at an appropriate pace for a beginner.  I find it relaxing and easy to follow, but not boring.  When I am finished with this workout, I feel loose and more balanced.

The two things I do not like are petty, although I will include them as part of the review.  I like yoga workouts that have beautiful scenery as I find it to be very relaxing.  This one was filmed in a studio.  I did not deduct a star for that, however.  I deducted a star because in some points, Allie talks as if she is speaking to 3-year-olds.  ""Roll over on your tummy"" and she sometimes uses a voice that you would use with small children.  That is the one thing that I find distracting/annoying about the DVD.  It is not enough to keep me away from the benefits of this workout though.  Overall, I really like this workout!",1357257600,3,1592,4.346938775510204
8271341,5,B0018XUT9A,"This DVD is really good, and easy to follow. Did it for 6 years on and off, and my dvd finally got too scratched so I am going to re-buy it.",1357084800,2,140,3.5483870967741935
