2817947,2,B000PFUA7S,"A complete waste of time and money. I ordered this in my quest to obtain more period movies. I found it to have no redeeming features. If you are a Jane Austin fan, you won't like this one.",1238976000,3,189,4.0
2817948,4,B000PFUA7S,"Mrs Beeton's 1861 guide to running a household was popular among Victorian housewives, and her legacy lives on till today, though the format of her book has gone through lots of revisions since then. This Masterpiece Theatre offering paints a portrait of Mrs Beeton's life from her early courtship by Mr Samuel Beeton, marriage and business partnership with her husband till her demise. The narration interestingly enough is by Mrs Beeton [Anna Madeley] herself after her death.

Anna Madeley plays her role very convincingly, and though much of the story here is based on speculation, the story does not get far-fetched nor too droll. It is well-done and the casting is excellent. Anna Madeley is also the actress who played the role of Lucy Steele in the 2007 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility. There are many familiar actors in this production. JJ Field's who plays the role of Sam Beeton was also cast as Mr Tilney in the 2007 adaptation of Northanger Abbey, and the actress portraying Mrs Beeton's mother also played Caroline Bingley in the 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice.

The story itself centers around a young, ambitious and intelligent woman, Isabella, who follows her heart and marries Samuel Beeton, a publisher of not much means, and after deciding that she is not really made for the role of a housewife [something that was demanded by Victorian mores of the time], scandalises her conservative parents by going to work with her husband in his publishing business. They decide to publish a book on aspects of domesticity and which proves to be a big hit upon publication. Though their business partnership is harmonious and initially profitable, their domestic life is wrought with tragedies - Isabella suffers many miscarriages, and also loses some of her children [she conceives many children throughout her marriage] to sudden, inexplicable death. Only much later do we learn [after Isabella undertakes to research the symptoms and causes of her children's death and her husband's ill health] the real, shocking truth behind her misfortunes.

This is a rather well-made period drama that portrays domestic life in Victorian times as well as a woman's struggles during the time - to achieve some semblance of independence, career satisfaction as well as juggling the demands of motherhood and being a wife. Quite a revolutionary undertaking for a Victorian woman but in Anna Madeley's capable hands, Mrs Beeton is credibly portrayed. I did find the many asides [where the lead character addresses the viewer directly] to be a tad distracting, but it didn't detract too much from my enjoyment of the movie.

I would recommend this movie to fans of period dramas, with a warning. Though it does have some humor, the story itself is quite tragic. The movie has fine acting and wonderful sets and cinematography. All in all, a worthwhile viewing experience.",1208217600,32,2879,5.067510548523207

2817950,3,B000PFUA7S,Nice period piece but the aside commentary was distracting and not necessary.  The movie did not capture the real depth of this amazing woman's life.  Perhaps next time.,1199750400,,169,5.0

2817952,5,B000PFUA7S,"This could have been a downer, but because of the wonderful actress and personality of Mrs. Beeton (would be nice if she was really that smart, clever, funny and positive), it was very well enjoyable.  All the actors were fantastic.  Isabella Beeton was a remarkable woman and her perseverance against so many awful things was quite inspiring.",1186272000,30,343,5.0
2817953,5,B000PFUA7S,"It's odd, when you first move away from home, and suddenly, you're faced with running a household. Meals prepared, a home to keep clean and tidy and stocked, emergencies that happen and you're not sure if the professionals need to be called in, or can you handle it by yourself. There's a thousand questions that need to be answered, and if you were lucky (or smart) as a kid, you learned them when you were growing up. Even in this age of marvels, these answers can be elusive, and I wonder how much more so it must have been in our grandmothers and great-grandmothers times.

Welcome to the time of Mrs. Beeton, when England was firmly entrenched in the Victorian period of the nineteenth century, and the Industrial Revolution was creating a new middle class. Only thing was, many of these women who were the daughters and wives of these new households were suddenly full of questions about how to manage servants, what was expected socially, how to dress and everything that could possibly be imagined. And in a class conscious world, women were already expected to know how to do all this.

The film opens with an elegantly dressed woman observing a funeral. She has something about her that immediately catches our attention, perhaps it's the ready smile, or the clever look in her eyes. This, she annouces, is the funeral of a nobody, indeed, it's her own. And who is she? Why none other than Mrs. Beeton herself...

We first meet Isabella Mayson (Anna Madeley) as a young woman just returned from schooling in Germany. Eldest of an enormous brood of children and stepchildren, Bella's not quite so skilled in the gracious arts of a middle class girl, but she has a quick and clever mind, and when she meets the son of a family friend, it's love at first sight for them both.

But Sam Beeton (JJ Feild) isn't quite the match that her parents have hoped for. He's a struggling publisher, dabbling about in magazines, and they want to make sure that their Bella will be comfortable and happy. No marriage, it seems for Sam and Bella, unless Sam can keep her in a home and garden of her own. Soon enough, it seems that Sam has indeed fulfilled his promise, for Bella is wed and blissfully happy, in a cozy home in the London suburbs, and even a devoted maid, Ann (Siobhan Hayes) to help her set up housekeeping.

Bella isn't quite so certain of her skills, and she struggles with both cooking -- something she can't quite do, and being a helpmeet and wife for her Sam. One day she heads for his office in London, and discovers that he's out, and sets herself down and translates an article for his magazine, despite the protests of his assistant, Fred (Joseph Mawle). When Sam finally returns, he begins to realize what a real treasure he has in his Bella, and soon enough, she's become a writer for his magazine, The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, one of the first publications that was geared towards women, and the ancestor of all those lifestyle magazines so popular today.

But if their professional life was improving, there was a tragic secret at the heart of Sam and Bella's marriage, one that is destroying their family, and eventually will take all of their dreams.

The humour in this one is of the subtle sort -- watch for a riotous scene involving a turtle that Ann has brought from the market to be turned into soup. And Bella's own comments on what was expected of a good wife, and the reality of it, make for a good chuckle or two. Interspersed with this are tragedies of the worst sort, which Anna Madeley truly brings to life with convincing grief and sorrow. It's this blend of the happy and sad that makes this movie work so well.

One of the high points in this, besides Anna Madeley's acting, are the details in costuming and set design. I felt like I had actually stepped back in time, and while we do get to see the more sordid, grimy side of life, there's some truly beautiful sequences in here, and Jon Jones' direction is light enough to let the story speak for itself.

Those who are curious about Isabella Beeton should try to find a copy of Kathryn Hughes' biography, <a href=""[...]"">The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs. Beeton,</a> which goes into more detail about the middle class women of Victorian England. Finally, if anyone is curious, Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management is still in print today, and there's been several modernized spin-offs that take some of her recipes and updated them for the modern cook.

While it is rather specialized in the subject matter, it's a thoughtful and evocative look at the past, and it's one that I happily recommend. There isn't a rating, but given some of the serious subject matter, I would suggest a PG-13, and leave it up to the parent's to decide if they want to let their children see it. Some sex is hinted at, and glimpses of London's underworld of prostitution and disease are present, but nothing is vulgar or vivid, either.

The DVD release is scheduled for mid-June 2007 and I will update this review if there is any need to do so once I have my own copy. And yes, that's the highest recommendation that I can give to this film, that I enjoyed it enough to want to add a copy to my own collection.

Happily recommended. Four and half stars, rounded up to five.",1180742400,168,5262,4.574309978768578

She was brought up in an upper middle class family, educated abroad and married within her class.  Women like Mrs. Beeton had cooks and housemaids to provide meals and do all the things necessary to run an efficient and comfortable home. Consequently, most young women did not have a clue as to how to run a home, nor did Mrs. Beeton.  She was, however, curious and clever.  She went to work with her husband,a Publisher, and began to write articles and suggestions, copied from others to help women cope with running a home. Meals, managing servants, entertaining, became her bailiwick. Women bought her writings and she became famous, and still is, for her cookbook. Her cookbook was comprised of recipes done by other people.  Mrs. Beeton could not cook.

She was unique for her time as most women did not go near their husband's business, nor write articles and books. (He must have been a very forward looking sort of guy.) She saw a need and filled it. She had a successful marriage and career, but her life was not without tragedy. She had several miscarriages and lost two boys, one to croup and another to scarlet fever. Only 1 child survived.  She died at 28 a day after giving birth.  The child did not survive. A few biographers have attributed these tragedies to Mrs. Beeton having contracted Syphilis from her husband.

On a more positive note, she did develop a successful career when it was rare for women to do so. She was loved by her husband and packed a lot of living into her very short 28 years. Who hasn't heard of Mrs. Beeton?  I liked the movie and recommend it.  Buy it and enjoy a little history about this amazing woman.",1330473600,,1948,5.040498442367602
2817956,2,B000PFUA7S,"(CONTAINS SPOILERS)
If Isabella Beeton had a secret life, this film does not examine it.  The facts of her domestic and journalistic existence were obviously open to Victorians and moderns alike.  What the movie does imply is that she had a secret IN her life--that her husband contracted syphilis from a prostitute, that a physician hid the fact from her, and that the deaths of both Isabella, her spouse, and some of her children were the result of the social disease.
According to historical facts, however, common non-syphilitic maladies afflicted her family, and she herself succumbed to childbed fever.  Did the film's creators believe the presence of an STD would make the feature more interesting?  Well, they were wrong.  This movie could scarcely be more dull, plodding, and predictable.  Only the good performances of the actors raise it above utter awfulness.  Had it been written and directed as a straight drama, it likely would have been much better.  But, instead, the story is related in a lighthearted, at times comedic mood, partly narrated by a whimsically smiling dead woman who appears to possess an amusing secret.  (That syphilis wrecked her mortal existence?  Hilarious, indeed.)
To put it succinctly, the plot appears to have no point and is about as intriguing as a police blotter.",1325980800,4,1308,5.070093457943925
2817957,5,B000PFUA7S,"I found this to be a remarkable film. Great costumes, and good story line.  It was a bit unusual in the way it was present, but very enjoyable.

2817958,5,B000PFUA7S,"I first caught this on PBS last year -- and watched it through beginning to end this year after having seen Anna Madeley in ""Affinity"" (and she's even lovelier in person and a very petite woman). I really like this movie -- I enjoy the narration ""from the grave"" and the narration of instructions and recipes from the books, the 3rd wall acknowledgment. It tells a story of a smart woman who is doing her best to do her own thing -- and her struggles to give the benefit of doubt to her husband. Her story has a sad ending but it's a really great story nonetheless. Seriously, folks - we're talking about an era when women would die of pneumonia from washing their hair when the weather was too cold (shampoo was only invented in the 1920s). Highly recommended.",1316563200,,761,4.442857142857143

2817961,1,B000PFUA7S,"This movie was a disappointment for me. I am a fan of the BBC and because of the synopsis on the BBC website I was expecting an interesting biography for the family to enjoy. I was shocked that the very first scene was R rated. The costumes were great. The characters were likable. However I think the movie lacked honesty. The relationship between Mr and Mrs Beeton was overly romanticized - very disneyish. I do not believe that Mrs Beetons' reactions to her circumstances rang true. The story was very superficial - as if the writer had not studied his subject and had no idea how she would really have acted. The intention was too celebrate a brilliant woman and give us insight into who she really was, this was not accomplished. The combination of wonderful art, a truly sad story, and an unrealistically upbeat narrator Mrs Breeton (who is speaking to us on the day of her funeral) lends a very morbid and twisted feel to the movie. SPOILER: Shortly before she dies Mrs Breeton learns that her husband has given her syphilis which was the cause of her death, and the deaths of all of her children.

Overall the characters lacked complexity and left me unsympathetic. Overly stylized: too much flash and not enough substance. Superficial portrait of this very interesting woman.",1271462400,12,1284,4.732142857142857

8190975,5,B000PFUA7S,"Before there was Martha Stewart and Julia Childs, there was Mrs. Beeton.  This amazing woman lived in England in 1800s.  She was from the upper middle class and her family sent her to boarding school in Germany when she was very young hoping oot secure her worthy husband and prosperous future.  Shortly after graduating, she married a young man (Sam), her parents found unsuitable because he was not financially established.  He started a publishing company and was distributing magazines.

Bored with staying at home alone, Isabella Beeton joins her husband and his employees in the shop.  She helps with translations from French to English and eventually comes up with an idea to write a book about running a household and selection of cooking recipies.  Her book is comprehensive guide to women on how to efficiently run the household, how to dress, plan meals, manage household budget and raise children.  As she and her husband Sam are building their business, their personal life is in shambles.  After seven years of marriage, they have no house, no savings, they are nearly bankrupt and three of their children die mysteriously and unexplainably one after another.

Mrs. Beeting loves her husband and in spite of his fondness for alchohol and his inability to establish stable business, she seems to be his driving force and guide in life.  It is during her second pregnancy and childbirth that she discovers that her husbands fragile health is due to STD he acquired before they were married.  Soon she realizes that I was her and her children that were affected by his desease and shortly after her second childbirth, she dies at the age of 28.

It is an interesting Masterpiece Theatre movie about the woman who was not afraid to break tradition and create her own career in the publishing world when no women ever dared to do so.  Her devotion to her husband and her marriage damaged her relationship with her parents who were overly protective, yet intrusive of her life and personal choices.  And it is ironic that it was she who died young and paid the price for Sam's sexual transgressions.  He got to live another 20 years regretting his choices and mourning the loss of the woman who was everything to him.  She finally found her peace and to this day she is a household name on how to run a home, family and finances.",1360713600,,2337,4.77363184079602
