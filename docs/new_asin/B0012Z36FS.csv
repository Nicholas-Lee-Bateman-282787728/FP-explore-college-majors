8248597,2,B0012Z36FS,"There is a lot to recommend about this series
for young people about a superhero and his allies
who battle against spiritual and temporal forces
of evil while quoting Bible passages and acting
accordingly.
The topics are timely, at least for now,
and reasonably well thought out.
It is entertaining, even for an adult if that adult
has a love of campy entertainment and has not spent
too much time spanking his inner child.

The superhero(s) are modeled on Batman and Robin (and Batgirl)
and on Green Hornet and Cato and borrow a lot from the style
of the 1960's television shows based on those characters.
They have a secretive lair that they operate out of,
wacky looking outfits (in this case, extremely wacky).
and go about battling demonic enemies and solving real
world problems by counseling their (the demons') intended victims.
They also work out their own spiritual lives in the process.

The production values are like those of low budget
television shows for children, pretty good, but not great,
and the action moves along at a fast enough pace to remain
interesting.
There is an irreverent sense of humor throughout the show
and therein lies a big part of the problem.

Bibleman, one would assume, is a Christian, and his job
would be to love God and his fellow man and win souls for Christ.
That element is in there.
If one discerns the dialogue and themes in these stories with
intellect and reason and moves beyond the name of the superhero
and the occasional quote from the Bible and reference to Jesus,
there is very little that is particularly Christian.
There is a somewhat vague Christian world view,
but not specifically,and could easily fit into many other
philosophical outlooks.
The idea one gets is that Christianity is nothing more than
a recipe for good living.
That is a severely dumbed-down version of Christianity
that will do little to help anybody.
Use the ""fruits"" of the post-Vatican Council II Catholic Church
as an example of the result of that type of defective approach.

This kind of presentation succeeds as entertainment,
but is extremely deficient, even damaging, as a presentation
of Christianity.
Therein lies the problem with this series.
There are a plenty of more entertaining superhero programs
out there, so there is no reason to check out this one unless
it successfully differentiates itself by its professed Christian approach.
It does not, in fact, it is to be avoided by the parent
or teacher for whom that matters.",1314316800,,2471,4.876190476190477
8248598,5,B0012Z36FS,"This is a beautiful set, and you get 5 different movies, so it's a great savings over individual prices.  Delivered quickly, in perfect condition.
Bibleman is great.  These videos are so well done, the hero character always quotes the Word of God (accurately, nothing out of context on these) when confronted with problems, issues, or problems of any sort.  Great teaching tool for any church class for kids, or at home to reinforce Bible teaching.
We have a library of Christian movies, but nothing gets and keeps their attention like Bibleman.  (By the way, Bible Girl is also in these:)",1293148800,3,589,4.86
