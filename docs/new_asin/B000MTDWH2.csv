2747628,5,B000MTDWH2,"After reading the review for this DVD in Pilates Style Magazine, I thought that I would give it a try. Other videos that I have purchased didn't really give me the instruction and understanding that made for an efficient pilates workout. Discovering Pilates was different.  This video felt as if Jon Belanger was in your living room personally helping you through each move. He gives you a comprehensive understanding of pilates and one hell of a workout!  I would recommend Discovering Pilates to anyone at any skill level. You WILL feel these workouts the next day!",1189641600,,567,4.895833333333333
2747629,5,B000MTDWH2,"I have endured many different types of workouts over a 21 year military career and honestly had no experience with Pilates.  Through this instruction, you will quickly recognize that Jon Belanger is a ""professor of exercise"" and he has simply hit a bull's eye with this DVD.  I used the word ""endured"" above because many workouts fail to target specific muscle groups in a low impact approach.  Jon's straight forward approach to Pilates will immediately target those specific muscle groups improving your overall strength and posture.  Get ready to feel great!",1188777600,,561,5.131868131868132
2747630,5,B000MTDWH2,"I bought this video after taking a class from Jon Belanger out in San Diego.  The guy knows his stuff!!  I have had no better workout in the last few years that working with him for just an hour.  The video is more of the same and you can expect a top-notch workout in a professional and easy-to-use format for anyone to enjoy.  New to Pilates myself, I was skeptical about the intensity of the workout.  I was shocked at how much I ached the next day and even more shocked at how fast I saw results in just a short amount of time.  I recommend this video to anyone and everyone who wants to take their workout to the next level.  Jon is a stud!",1185840000,,645,4.071428571428571
2747631,5,B000MTDWH2,"I am very pleased with this purchase. As the introduction on the DVD box cover says, this is a ""no nonsense"" instruction for an excellent strength training exercise through classical Pilates movements.  I am a runner/marathoner and I have found combining this Pilates work-out with my long distance running has helped me a lot. I feel stronger with much improved form, muscle definition and core strength.  I highly recommend JonnyPilates mat work-out if you are trying Pilates for the first time, or have done it before.  And if you live in San Diego area, you may want to try a few sessions on a reformer with Jon.",1174867200,2,616,4.738317757009346
2747632,5,B000MTDWH2,"I have tried just about every type of work out there and have numerous work out videos; this is by far the best one out there.  The Pilates moves are easily explained and anyone is capable of the exercises, which provide a great work out for all fitness levels.  The 2 different level work outs provide great flexibility in letting you chose how hard of a work out you want to do.  I have had the video for only 2 weeks and can already see results.  If you want a quality work out video, look no further!",1171929600,3,504,4.164948453608248

2747635,5,B000MTDWH2,I try and get my cardio and conditioning in when I workout at my small home gym and this dvd was a great alternative to my usual conditioning routine. When I first started the DVD workout I was a beginner to Pilates so I appreciated the breakdown. Its a great workout that also leaves you feeling stretched which is important since I'm so tight. Would highly recommend this dvd especially to guys!,1315958400,,397,4.527777777777778

2747637,5,B000MTDWH2,"Over the years I have tried various exercise-oriented DVDs only to be disappointed by the lack of instruction or boring routines.  I have found ""Discovering Pilates"" by Jon Belanger to be perhaps the only DVD that provided value to me.  His easy and yet detailed explanations provide a platform from which it is quickly easy to do the exercises as described. He has an engaging presence. Jon provides enough detail about the exercise and why it is a done a certain way to enhance the entire experience.  Thanks, Jon, for finally putting out a pilates DVD that I will want to use over and over.",1315267200,,593,4.628571428571429
2747638,1,B000MTDWH2,"I hate to be unfair and give a product I haven't actually bought a review, but I feel as if I should give other viewers of this product a caveat. Plus, a 1 star will hardly make a dent to the 86 out of 90 5 star ratings this has.

Look at the reviews. Pages upon pages of 2 to 3 lines reviews from accounts that have NO other activity (reviews or wish list). Not real-name confirmed, not verified purchases, EXTREMELY similar writing styles. These are very clear-cut patterns and shocking disparities between these reviews and the reviews on other Pilates DVDs.

Rather suspicious, isn't it? I was really excited to buy this DVD after looking at the great ratings, but not anymore. This kind of shady manipulation is intensely off-putting to me, and I hope it will be to other would-be purchasers of this DVD as well.",1314489600,41,817,4.513513513513513
2747639,5,B000MTDWH2,"Until I recently took a class from Jon, I'd been avaoiding pilates as something I could not do.  Jon's approach is encouraging yet challenging.

2747640,5,B000MTDWH2,"I took my first-ever Pilates class from Jon last week while I was vacationing with girl friends in the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego. Pilates, where have you been all my life? If I could only use one word to describe this DVD is would be ""life-changing"" (OK, maybe that is two words).

2747641,5,B000MTDWH2,"Great DVD! I really like the two-workout program! The first workout provides clear and concise explanations of the exercises and the second is extremely challenging.

2747643,5,B000MTDWH2,"I'm fortunate enough to have Jon teach me Pilates in person, and his teaching style has completely changed my mindset toward fitness.

My range of motion really has improved and this DVD does an excellent job in learning the basic movements of pilates and, more importantly, why these exercises work so well.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who in interested in learning more about pilates.",1311292800,,429,4.863013698630137
2747646,5,B000MTDWH2,This DVD does a very good job of articlulating the proper biomechanics of pilates movements.  I found it to be much more effective than taking classes because the pilates movements are explained in thorough details that helps anyone really understand the reasons behind each movement.  I would definitely recommend this.,1309996800,,320,5.38
2747647,5,B000MTDWH2,"I found this DVD a great tool to enhance my practice.

2747650,5,B000MTDWH2,"I had the opportunity to take 3 Pilates classes instructed by Jon while attending a meeting in San Diego. It was the most invigorating and calming way to start a day full of long lectures. Jon is an amazing instructor. After the meeting I continued my new Pilates routine through this video in my daily workouts.
I strongly recommend this even for a Pilates beginner. It has created a new way for me to begin my days by awakening my body and mind.

2747651,5,B000MTDWH2,"As a total pilates newbie and a lifelong Klutz I was hesitant to even try Jon Belanger's DVD,Discovering Pilates, afraid that it might end up collecting dust with the rest of my exercise DVDs. Wbat a wonderful surprise to discover that through Jon's expert, yet idiot proof instruction, even my lack of coordination did not hinder my ability to execute every exercise! Okay, at first I didn't look pretty, but within two weeks I had graduated to the intermediate/advanced section. It was a miracle and so effective. A month later, my core is tight as a drum (so helpful in negotiating the Boston icewalks this winter)and I swear I've grown a half an inch. So many people have approached me telling me how great I look and asking if I've lost weight. I smile to myself and say an inner ""thank you"" to Jon. If you have never gotten into in exercise DVD before, treat yourself and try this one. I promise you, you won't be disappointed.",1299369600,3,933,4.592814371257485
2747652,5,B000MTDWH2,This is a must have DVD if you are on the road a lot like me.  I take Jon wherever I go and I love the fact that this DVD gives me the option of doing a 30 or 40 minute workout.  Jon's cues and the onscreen tips keep my workout effective and fun!!!  Definitely recommend adding this one to your collection. You won't be disappointed!,1295568000,,333,4.015151515151516
2747653,5,B000MTDWH2,"Workout 1 is a great choice for beginning/intermediate students, as Jon explains clearly the proper movement, as well as common mistakes of newbies.  Workout 2 definitely is more challenging, getting to each movement more quickly, so  you can get the most bang for your buck.  Really nice!",1291507200,,289,5.1063829787234045
2747654,5,B000MTDWH2,"This is a fantastic workout for beginners or intermediate Pilates students.  I travel a lot, and this DVD goes with me every time.  Jon's instruction is clear and to the point, and there are two workouts to choose from.  I love it and I've seen results already!",1290643200,,261,4.51063829787234
2747655,5,B000MTDWH2,This DVD offers great instruction and two challenging routines. As someone who has been training martial arts almost 15 years I've seen my share of workouts. This program addresses an often times overlooked area of physical fitness and strength....stabilzer muscles! Jon provides excellent instruction and a program that will help you improve your physical fitness and have a beneficial effect on any other athletic endeavors you enjoy. Buy it you won't be sorry.,1280793600,,463,5.3561643835616435
2747656,5,B000MTDWH2,"Great job.  As a 46 year old guy trying not to let his body get beaten up by time, I appreciate Jon's techniques & patience.  Put me down for a pre-order of his next project.",1280275200,,174,3.942857142857143
2747657,5,B000MTDWH2,"I just completed Jon Belanger's Discovering Pilates (workout 1 and workout 2) DVD session. I have been searching for some time for a concise, easy to follow Pilates DVD that I can take with me when I travel. This program has helped me ""rediscover Pilates""...wherever I go!
I consider myself a beginner-intermediate Pilates student and found his workout program not only easy to follow, understand and complete, but challenging and exceptionally detailed-oriented. The well thought out presentation in this DVD not only gives me a full understanding of each exercise performed, but the confidence that I am gaining the most benefit from ""doing it right"" the first time and feeling the benefit of the exercise from the start. I first started taking Pilates several years ago to help improve my swimming. Simply strengthening my core allowed me greater movement control in the water and thus increased my speed and endurance.  It's the perfect complement to my exercise regime,which includes swimming, running and biking. Now, since I travel frequently, Jon's DVD will be in my suitcase with every trip I take. Finally, a program that works...on my time!",1279497600,,1151,5.1550802139037435
2747658,5,B000MTDWH2,"The thing about Pilates is you have to do it right to get the most out of it so you have to have a good teacher  and Jon is the best. For me,watching this DVD with his instructions is like a coaching experience. And after watching it over and over, I notice that when I really focus on his instructions, I can feel my core getting a better workout. I would rather learn from a low-key sexy male instructor like Jon (and his fit female assistant) than with the typical cheerleader types that make glitzy DVDs.",1279497600,,508,4.291666666666667
2747659,5,B000MTDWH2,"I am extremely appreciative of Jon Belanger's approach to Pilates.  Many of us have practiced for years, and as in any sport, we become complacent about form and breathing. Back to basics is essential at any level of athleticism. Jon coaches us as we move forward through every exercise, gently correcting, encouraging us just where it counts, and....reminding us to breathe!!
The Beginner's workout is an excellent introductory session for those new to the practice of Pilates. Precise and explicit in its content, it is accessible to the newbie. We've all tried videos geared to beginners, only to feel completely discouraged by the experience, turning us into dropouts rather than converts.  This workout encourages the beginner to stay mindful of the purpose of each exercise, and helps set healthy expectations for progress in the practice, yet serves as an essential review for the everyday Pilates aficionado!
The Advanced workout definitely adds the extra level of challenge experienced Pilates practitioners are looking for, and brings the beginners to the next stage of fitness they are seeking. Different options are offered for each user's level for those who are ready to power up.
Overall I give this video top marks for its expertise and its clarity. Bottom line: a very satisfying workout.",1278720000,,1305,5.20952380952381
2747660,4,B000MTDWH2,"I purchased this DVD to supplement my recovery program from a serious back injury.  I am a former competitive kick boxer and consider myself to be in pretty good shape.
The DVD is great for learning the fundamentals of Pilates and really helpful for people with injuries who need to be extra careful.  However I cannot say it's much of a workout for people already in decent shape.  I have only tried the beginner workout though.",1278115200,,429,4.618421052631579
2747661,5,B000MTDWH2,"I have never done Pilates before and it is wonderful. I actually got my husband doing it. The instructions are easy to understand and at a pace that you can easily do. It really motivated me AND my husband, plus we are doing something together. Due to an active younger life style we both have knee and shoulder problems, we were looking for something we could do to stay in shape and lose weight and this was it. We are now able to move on to more challenging Pilates, is there any? Hopefully Jonny puts out more DVDs.",1270944000,,519,4.3061224489795915

2747664,5,B000MTDWH2,"I have tried many aerobic exercise, and have failed at all of them. I would quit after the first 10 minutes or so with an aching body, shortness of breath and a feeling that I just can't keep up or go on. I have tried pilates (and enjoyed it) on wii fit, but I never got a full work out. I have been desperate to find a fun workout that I can commit to. I have read many reviews on amazon for different workout programs, but never made up my mind. Then I remembered I had a dvd that I purchased over a year ago, and I never opened it. Well I popped it in the dvd player, and I must say...it was not a fun workout, instead it was calm and AMAZING. I completed the workout. I broke a little sweat and felt a lot of burn, and I was able to breath at all times. I feel my hips and back are looser already. I highly recommend this video.",1262908800,,832,3.871345029239766

2747669,5,B000MTDWH2,Pilates is all about small movements preformed in a specific way.  Jon does a great job at helping one master the technique.

The instructions are very thorough, which makes a big difference with pilates because the exercises are not beneficial when you are not doing them correctly. As an advanced student, the periods of instruction are useful breaks for rest, stretching, or increased reps. This is a workout that I will continue for many years to come.",1254614400,2,500,4.758620689655173

You end up doing extra repetitions or just stretching while the teachers explain the movements yet again.  For something you can work out to on a regular basis, the fast-moving ""Classical Pilates Technique"" (mat workout) is a better choice.  Either that or you could search for a DVD that has an instructional track and a workout-only track.",1229990400,30,457,4.909090909090909

I have taken several Pilates classes at my local gym but they can't compare to the results I got from this video!  I used to think that I had to spend hours on a treadmill and wake up the next day barely able to walk to get a 'real workout', but Jon and his video changed my attitude!  Though I was in good shape to begin with I noticed sexy definition in my abs and upper thighs that no other work out has given me once I started this program.  On top of that, the coordinated breathing that accompanies the exercises and Jon's soothing voice really relaxes me.  Highly recommended for those of all fitness levels!!!",1226880000,2,726,4.380597014925373

I wanted an instructor that my husband would feel comfortable with (i.e. a man), and something that would be challenging for me while not too hard for my husband. We both enjoy the beginner workout, which I can get through easily but still get a workout, and he can't quite get through yet (he's very much a beginner to working out, much less Pilates). From watching the second workout it looks like it would be a challenge for me.

In terms of the instruction, it's the most clear that I've seen on a Pilates video so far-- it breaks things down in an easy to understand way and makes it possible to focus on the movement rather than the screen.",1226880000,10,702,4.4

He explains every position VERY clearly for good form and also gives you modifications. He has a very calm voice. I am only giving it 4 stars because it is very basic when it comes to background and enthusiasm. It basically shows John and a younger girl performing the exercises.  I prefer Ana Caban's beach scenes, Hilary Burnett's calming candle room or something more upbeat and enthusiastic like Mari Winsor's Bun & Thigh sculpting.  It's a good workout though if you don't need all the frills. You'll feel it the next day!
