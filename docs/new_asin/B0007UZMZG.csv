8441964,2,B0007UZMZG,"I was excited when I ordered this CD because I had been looking for a real hip hop workout for a while.  Well....I was more or less disappointed after doing the workout. Here's why...

Off the back I noticed that the instructor was surrounded by a bunch of children who were doing the workout with him.  I was kind of insulted by that.  I am 31. I'm not out of shape at all. I can run at least three times around a full track; however, I guess I would rather see adults on the screen rather than children. I'd like to think in my head that if the adults on the video can do this workout then so can I.  I didn't get that type of motivation. I took from it that these kids dance all of the time; of course, they're going to be able to perform these routines. It was more insulting than anything. If I wanted to watch children workout, I would've ordered a Barney's workout video.

Next the editor needs to retire and take up a new profession.  The routines were choppy.  They just cut off and repeat instantly and it does it too many times and it does it out of the blue. The first time I used the tape I stopped working out to check the dvd player to make sure that it wasn't stuck because the video would just stop and repeat itself over and over.

The bad editing made DeLanzer's instructions look more horrible than it already was. Now, I'm still a party girl so catching the routine was a no brainer; however, his delivery of the routine was awful. For example, he would say, ""now we're going to take this whole routine from the top."" OK, so I'm thinking we are going to start from the very beginning of the routine. NOOOOOOO, we start just that small portion. Oh yeah, when the video chop and repeats itself, it doesn't repeat from the beginning of the routine either.  But not only that, some of the moves changed.  I couldn't believe this video actually made it to an actual production.  I guess anything can be packaged and sold these days.

In short, It could have been a great workout if he had instructed his workout the same as his warm up, hire a new guy to do the editing so that the video didn't look so homemade, timed and organized the routine before recording and used adults in the background instead of kids, I may have enjoyed the workout.

Unfortunately, there's no refunds; otherwise, I would have sent it back the day I received it.",1168128000,,2356,4.300904977375565
