8311342,5,B001ISDIB6,"I don't think we will EVER see these sold again, DVD or otherwise. I've heard there are legal issues since the parties involved were reading ""live"" and their families are challenging the profits. So, I recommend you buy these now in whatever format you can find.
As for the documentary, absolutely the BEST EVER on Watergate. You can't get more accuracy than discussions with the actual players. In some cases, Haldeman is ACTUALLY reading his WH notes from the meetings! Fascinating! Should be mandatory viewing for history classes. (IMO, Liddy is a crazy idiot, and it shines through in these interviews!)",1407456000,5,607,5.01980198019802
8311343,5,B001ISDIB6,"I saw this when it came out on TV. I then got the box set of tapes. To hear the men who did the deeds and plotted the plots, talk about the how and why is something that give a insight into all the WTF things that happen in the real world. Some of the men sound like they had just awaken from a bad dream. Some like they had escaped from a cult. Some like this was the best thing that had ever happened to them. The interviews are jaw dropping.  I would buy this on DVDs. It should be shown in all American history classes.",1407196800,2,523,3.8878504672897196
8311344,1,B001ISDIB6,This Spring/Summer marks the 40-year anniversary of the Watergate hearings.  It's time for this show -- or some other long-form treatment of the story -- to come out on DVD. My low rating is only because of the VHS format.,1370822400,3,222,4.55
8311345,4,B001ISDIB6,"The Discovery Channel aired ""Watergate"" during the late 80's and early 90's, but it hasn't been shown for quite awhile. Former CBS newsman Daniel Schorr does an excellent job narrating the series, as he gradually unfolds the scandal that took down the President. It contains superb film footage of Richard Nixon and the entire Watergate cast. Conspirators H.R. Haldeman (Nixon's chief of staff), Gordon Liddy, Charles Colson, et. al. are interviewed throughout the documentary and finally ""tell all"".

I patiently waited for ""Watergate"" to appear on DVD, but eventually gave up and bought the VHS set. I enjoyed it, but give it only 4 stars because the VHS edition is a wee bit grainy in quality. Another reason to keep hoping it will appear on DVD soon, as it's good enough to buy again.",1322352000,7,788,4.880597014925373
8311346,4,B001ISDIB6,"I seriously believe if it weren't for Liddy's need to be a ham, Watergate probably would have passed through history as just another third rate burglary. OK, to be fair, all the players had a hand in creating this presidential and national disaster. Daniel Schorr brought together some of the players from this real life drama and let them tell their versions of what happened and why. I only wish it were available on DVD so it can be preserved longer. This VHS version is good, but it's getting harder to find a VCR player. I also wish this had been a longer story, to squeeze in more information. But, budgets being what they are, Schorr still put together a good story.",1255219200,2,673,4.524590163934426
