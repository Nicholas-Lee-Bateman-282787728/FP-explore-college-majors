5934608,1,B00BFWZ1CE,"Not what it should have been. All the hype, just bland. Not worth watching.",1439510400,,75,4.428571428571429
5934609,3,B00BFWZ1CE,"An interesting plot but not enough thriller action until the very end.

Thorne did pretty well at playing the part of an 18 year old girl, Hazel, with agoraphobia (fear of things that might cause panic or embarrassment -- in Hazel's case, the outside world). The beginning of the movie starts out with Hazel being transported to a treatment facility when their transport vehicle is ambushed in the desert. Hazel must overcome her fear of the outside world long enough to find help.

The concept was interesting -- what would it take for you to overcome a certain fear(s) and fight for your survival? Could you overcome a major psychological disorder long enough to do so? In that aspect, Big Sky had an empowering vibe. There was the right amount of push and pull in the struggle without abandoning the concept of agoraphobia all together.

Beyond that, it was hard to really get into Big Sky. The scenes felt choppy. What was meant to show flashbacks and happenings at two different scenes at the same time, came off as disjointed many times. I was easily distracted, which isn't a 5 star mark for a film. It also left a lot of questions unanswered. Why were they ambushed? That was the whole point of the story and all I found out in the end was not to trust 90% of the people you happen across in a desert. And I'm still confused about the exact trigger of Hazel's agoraphobia. My understanding is that it was the outside world in general. Her flashbacks didn't help to identify it.

There wasn't a whole lot of suspense. Much of the thrills came in the last 20 minutes.",1439510400,,1573,4.5477031802120145
5934610,5,B00BFWZ1CE,Dewey was married to Peggy Lee for awhile. He was young and handsome and this was one of his roles he starred in with Kirk Douglas. Then like Christopher Jones he had vanished. TCM ran this movie but it was made from different sources. So I bought the VHS which is a perfect complete movie. It can easily be transferred to a DVD too. He was also in an Egyptian movie with Joan Collins. I wish there was a book about him. I guess he is now 90 years old and still going strong.,1399680000,,475,4.0638297872340425

Photography is lovely, and the most beautiful scenery in the entire work is a shirtless Francois Arnaud wearing low-slung, tight jeans in an all-too-brief time onscreen. I give the film 3 stars, but if Francois had had a larger role, I'd have given it 5, because he is the only reason I bought and watched this movie, and goddam, he was worth it.",1445040000,,412,4.5675675675675675

5934622,4,B00BFWZ1CE,"Well acted by Bella Thorne, it gives you a glimpse into a condition we wouldn't understand.  It also presents that in some cases circumstances will give us the courage to overcome deficits and put the concern and welfare of others above those limitations because of love.  Liked the way the story evolved and revealed clues as to her past trauma and to the current drama.  Good balance of tension and suspense.",1441065600,,410,4.746478873239437

It's one of those movie you put on as background noise, it was way too slow for me to just sit there & watch. I do give Bella Thorne her props though she did a pretty good acting job in it, just wish there was action scenes. They threw a lot of random parts in the mix which made it confusing & hard to follow....or just boring.",1440374400,,409,4.0

I should have learned my lesson, when Amazon's listing doesn't show the CC  it means what it says. Forget what the packaging shows you.

Plus what I did watch (about 10 minutes using super duper Bose headphones was a sorry waste. Shame on all participants in this production",1440288000,,414,4.581081081081081
5934627,1,B00BFWZ1CE,The worst movie. Terrible!!  Mostly scenes of girl with agoraphobia walking in desert very slowly......drags on and on. Bad ending.,1440201600,,131,5.55
5934628,1,B00BFWZ1CE,"The credits at the end last 5 1/2 minutes with really slow piano playing. They should have the credits and the piano playing at the beginning to warn viewers of the slow pace of the film. I fell asleep watching the movie. I had to back it up and watch parts of it again. It was hard to follow. I have to tell you, I wouldn't build a mental treatment center in the middle of a desert, particularly if you are treating agoraphobics afraid of open spaces. I think a rural area in Pennsylvania with a lake and trees, and maybe some Amish people riding in those horse drawn carriages would have worked better.  She could get lost in a wooded area in the winter. Snow. Blowing wind. Crazy Pennsyl-tucky locals. The main character's name is Hazel. Hmmmm.  Did you know that Hazel is a nut bearing tree? Must be a message there. I thought the kidnappers were nicer than some of the passengers. I mean the guy with the striped shirt was eating a twinkie. How bad could he be? I really hated the way the mother was breathing hard all the time. It was irritating. This movie lacked characters with emotions that made them likable. Did anyone see what state the license plate on the van was? I couldn't. Bella Thorne is pretty. She looks older than 18 though. She seemed too mature and pretty for the part. It seemed more like she had some kind of mental disorder, like she was slow or had brain damage. I wonder if she ever made it to the treatment center. That could be ""Big Sky 2"". She could be cured and drive the van on the way out. It could coincide with escaped prisoners...",1440028800,2,1569,4.333333333333333

5934631,2,B00BFWZ1CE,"Warning: possible spoilers!

Underwhelming English language thriller by the director of the original Spanish language version of We Are What We Are--although to be fair the problems are more with the writing than direction.  The story concerns a teen named Hazel (Bella Thorne--perhaps too healthy looking for a girl who hasn't left her room for two months) who suffers from a severe panic disorder that includes agoraphobia and OCD.  Her indulgent and loving mom Dee (Kyra Sedgwick--weirdly trailer trash for a woman with a rich ex-husband although that and the apparently modest house they live in seem to be hard-to-swallow writing choices made to set-up a later plot twist--at this point we don't know ex-hubby is super rich) is being forced by her ex to put Hazel in a special treatment center in the desert so arrangements have been made to transport her under special conditions--in an enclosed compartment in the back of a van that will give her a small space separated from everyone else so she won't be hit by distractions that might trigger panic attacks or her agoraphobia.

Since Hazel is freaking out about getting in the van mom Hazel decides to come along for the ride to the institution as well.  The driver picks up three more passengers but before we get to know much about them the van is stopped in a nicely disorienting scene that seems to Hazel at first to be an accident but it isn't.  Everyone visible in the van is shot except for the girl who had been picked up a few minutes earlier--she is grabbed and thrown in the back of a vehicle which speeds away.

Hazel is afraid her mom is dead and crawls out of her hiding place--it turns out mom isn't dead but she's shot and bleeding and in a lot of pain.  Panic Disorder riddled Hazel decides she can walk 5 miles through the desert to a reservation to get help for her mom since she will die without medical attention, the van isn't drive-able and all the phones were taken.

Big Sky doesn't do a very good job of putting us inside the mind of Hazel and helping us understand how she feels with her terror of the world so her trying to walk through the desert for much of the movie is even less exciting than it sounds.  The other story strand involved the kidnappers Jesse (Frank Grillo who was better in Purge 2) and his brain addled little brother Pru (Aaron Tveit in the film's most effective performance) who never should have been given live bullets, let alone a gun.  He's the one who shot everyone even though that was never actually part of the plan.  Jesse has a nagging feeling that something went wrong besides the dead bodies--the right number of people were in the van and they were the right sexes but why would their target, an agoraphobic girl with a rich dad be sitting in the front of the van?

Bella Thorne is a lovely young actress and her character Hazel is someone you really do want to root for but the movie never figures out how to generate any suspense from her attempted trek 5 miles across the desert to find help from her mom.  The more conventional kidnappers element draws whatever little suspense it manages out of the unpredictable behavior of crazier than his older brother will admit Pru, but it takes them way too long to figure out they grabbed the wrong girl and even after they do the movie doesn't pick up much urgency.

Big Sky has unusually good intentions for a thriller and a mostly fine cast but it's never actually very thrilling or smart--leaving another wounded survivor for Kyra Sedgwick's Dee to interact with might have been a good idea.  Having something actually go wrong during the kidnapping that resulted in all the shooting might have also been a good idea.  You never get much of a sense that either of the kidnappers know what they are doing and incompetent criminals rarely make for interesting film characters.  Wandering through the desert also rarely makes for exciting cinema and Big Sky only manages to prove that point once again.  If the film had done a better job of dramatizing how Hazel experienced the world and why everything was so terrifying for her maybe some of that terror would have transferred to the audience but Big Sky never comes close to pulling that off.  In the end Big Sky is nicely filmed and well-cast but mostly pretty dull.",1439683200,,4290,4.60498687664042

On netflix, you can watch it with CLOSED CAPTIONS which I always use.
