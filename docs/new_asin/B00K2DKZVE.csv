8655288,3,B00K2DKZVE,"I wasn't sure how to react to the movie ""All in Good Time"" when I heard about it.  I was a fan of Reece Ritchie's from his work on ""The Lovely Bones,"" so I wanted to see it, but I admit the subject matter was somewhat strange to me.  How could anyone develop a comedy about male impotence? After viewing this movie, I have to say that the film fits in well with other independent movies I have seen from Britain.  Odd, quirky, funny yet sad in parts, ""All in Good Time"" is a melodramatic comedy that is big on mellow, and slight on laughs.

Reece Ritchie is Atul and Amara Karan is Vina, two Hindu Indian newlyweds who are caught up in their in-laws drama due to their honeymoon plans being unexpectedly cancelled.  Atul is not exactly an alpha male-he is passive, not able to consummate his marriage due to a number of unresolved family issues that focus on his Father, Leeshwan Dutt.  Leeshwan, played by Harish Patel is overbearing, demanding and belittling of his son, which adds to the family conflict.

There is so much to love about this movie.  I found myself alternating between tears, and laughs.  It was originally based on a play, written in the 1960s, called Rafta Rafta.  Perhaps due to this reason the film feels oddly dated-as if it is not set in today's time, but in the 1960s.  And the subject matter, while daring; is interpreted strangely.  Perhaps this is due to cultural issues within the Hindu community that I simply do not understand as a caucasian.  When Atul is unable to perform, eventually this becomes a subject which both families feel they have to discuss.  Yet I do not understand how homosexuality is never once mentioned as a possible issue regarding Atul's inability to consummate his marriage to Vina.  Even if this was based on a play that was written in the 1960s, homosexuality was around back then to, and it is very surprising that it is not alluded to in any way, shape or form in the movie.  If I were a virgin newlywed, and my husband was unable to perform with me after our marriage; his being possibly gay  would be the first thing I would think of.  I realize homosexuality was not as open and dealt with in the 1960s as it is today.  Culturally I could not identify with two families discussing one son's inability to have sex in one of the scenes, this simply would not be done in my culture so it was hard to understand.  Perhaps this is true of Indian culture, I simply do not know.

The performances are excellent in the movie, and are worth seeing the film for.  Reece Ritchie is perfect as the frustrated, inept bridegroom.  Amara Karan is wonderful as the Bride Vina.  She is confused, but in love and wants to make her husband happy.  The Dutt family is really funny.  Harish Patel as Atul's intimidating Father is hilarious, and Meera Syal as Lopa, Atul's Mother is sympathetic and wise. The music score by Nitaz Chag is incredible, it highlights many of the best scenes of the movie, including the wedding scene which starts the movie and many of the dramatic scenes.  The music score was one of my favorite bits in the movie, there is not a soundtrack to this movie so I plan to find the pieces individually on iTunes.

So the movie was adequate, and good for one-time viewing.  I can't imagine seeing this film more than once.  But what really disappointed me about this product was the DVD. The DVD is a lousy purchase for the asking price.  There are no special features, no previews of other movies, and no menu options.  In fact, there is no menu! I have never ordered a made to purchase DVD from Amazon.com before, and I have decided I won't again. This DVD plays just like a videotape did when they made those.  The whole reason I like DVDs is I like the menu options, and the special features.  If you do want to see special features regarding this movie, go to Youtube, as there are a lot there.  The DVD is very disappointing, you need to rent this movie and not buy it.",1409788800,,3940,4.455307262569832
