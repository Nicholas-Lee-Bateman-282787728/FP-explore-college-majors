8149493,5,B000JBXHLO,"The Transcontinental Railroad is a good survey depicting the construction of the railroad that linked the eastern and western United States in 1869.  We learn about the visionaries who sought to build the railroad as well as the many obstacles and challenges facing the builders; these obstacles and challenges included steep mountains, parched deserts, long supply lines, snow, avalanches, labor shortages, and attacks by Native Americans defending their land.  The video also discusses the contributions made by Chinese laborers as well as the negative impacts felt by Native Americans as a result of the construction of the railroad.  The progression of the construction of the railroad is depicted on an animated map during the program.  I use this video as a supplement to my American history lessons on Westward Movement and have found it to be an effective teaching tool.",1494374400,,878,5.25

8149499,4,B000JBXHLO,"I thought it was interesting, the challenge given by the President $20,000 per 10 miles on flat ground and $34,000 for foothills, and for mountains $48,000. They used nitroglycerin instead of gun powder for explosions. This was more dangerous, but more effective. As they put in the last 4 spikes, two were gold, one silver, and the fourth made of iron, gold, and silver.",1316390400,2,371,4.8125
