I think the most attractive part is the sound from the reader Mr. John Lone.
The sound is perfect, making the whole story touching and moving.
I like the sound more than the story.
Definitely I will buy this story and the video.",1366588800,,304,4.446428571428571

it is not the true story i expected, and at times the music is so much louder than the voice that it's distracting.
