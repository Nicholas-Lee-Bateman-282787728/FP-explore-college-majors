8442665,4,B004V2FVX4,"Ravi Shankar's Meharbaan is surely a 1993 classic. A beautiful film is every aspect. The script is lovely and very well made. The film was a Super-Hit when it released in 1993. A complete entertainer.
Performances: Mithun Chakraborty is a living legend, his performance here too is outstanding. Ayesha Jhulka is sweet in a small yet effective role. Shantipriya looks beautiful and does a decent job. Anupam Kher is fantastic. Kader Khan and Sadashiv Amarpurkar are tremendous.
Meharbaan is a complete family entertainer which deserves a watch for sure!",1305849600,,552,5.213483146067416
