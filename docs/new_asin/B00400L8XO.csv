4237584,2,B00400L8XO,"I don't know what the purpose of this film was other than to re-establish the obvious fact that gay men are visually oriented and there is a large subsection of gay men who place their looks above everything else. In the film, we meet a lot of them. Most of them aren't really that attractive but they are self-confident, muscular, trendy and semi well-maintained. And several of them (at least three who were interviewed) are porn stars, although only one of them is identified as such. So, the subjects are maybe not exactly representative of the greater gay male population. We also meet some outcasts (bears, goths) who bravely defy the stereotypical images and live to tell about it. But the ""hot"" guys all seem kind of dumb and not self-aware. What is the documentary trying to say about these men? I really have no idea. It offers no healthy alternative and no new perspectives on the culture of body image. It's as superficial as its subjects.",1326153600,8,951,4.700598802395209
4237585,5,B00400L8XO,"NOT! I loved this short film and I love "" steroid men that act like Paris Hilton."" Wonderful and some these what were they called? Oh! A listers/porn stars etc...when they said "" they wanted a relatonship and a person to see beyond the physical."" Give me a break. What a pitty party these roided boys have. Yes! the want a relationship but only with another roid by as dumb as they are. It's also funny, in my experience that yes they all sleep with each other and they all "" Judge others"" as not suitabe to join their group....and I've met them. Again they are like teenage girls with eating addictions. How many end up in ER because of their use? As the Doctor glances over, your heart is also a muscle. Steroid increases muscle size? Urg think about it. I would much prefer an honest man who gets up and goes to work, isn't a flake like most of these chidren and is blue collar. the one guy even remarks about his BOTOX...that "" we will all get there."" ReallY? how out of touch is that guy with the rest of us. Maybe the roids boys will get there. How innatley childlike the addiction to this type of hype and need for attention...its a good comedy show. I liked that quality about the short film. Man up.....grow up...get a life. Ignore these idiots as I do...but look at the movie for a laugh. It s good for a laugh. Especially those roids who open up there mouth...and have more lips than one could "" posssssssible "" imagine.

Now for a REAL MOVIE of signifance check "" EYES WIDE OPEN."" This is what gay struggle is about that gives the freedome to claim gay cutlure. Get beyound the narcissists and take a look at what ""real people"" deal with. This is what's important not gay roid men who feel there aren't enough because in reality there inferioriy isn't important and should not be applauded. This movie and these stuggles are.",1325462400,,1837,4.387096774193548
4237586,2,B00400L8XO,"This could have been a thoughtful retrospective on the shaping of male body image. Instead, it's a collection of facile observations superimposed on a constant barrage of voyeuristically-photographed shirtless men.

The key points include:

A. Pretty people are eye-catching.
B. Men are visual creatures.
C. Some gay men are image-obsessed.
D. Some gay men are insecure.
E. There's a feedback loop that results from physical fitness or the lack.

The first half of the movie is primarily interviews with shallow people describing their pressure to mold themselves into whatever physical ideal they feel their peer group demands. We then get a survey of industry practitioners that capitalize on body image: pornographers, a naked yoga instructor, therapists, and the like, followed by an off-key advertorial on medical anti-aging techniques. The film closes with commentary from older gay men who have found ways, whether by choice or force, to make themselves attractive outside of physical beauty.

All well and good, this, but not particularly insightful. What long-term harm might we expect from an overemphasis on appearance? Was it a backlash to the appearance of the AIDS-afflicted in the 1980s, or did the cultural shift begin earlier? To what extent is it reinforced by the fashion industry, or those that would seek to profit from insecurity? Are there parallels with metrosexuality in the straight population?

Grabbing this low-hanging fruit would have made for a vastly more interesting documentary. As-is, I can't recommend it.",1321488000,2,1541,5.404166666666667

4237588,2,B00400L8XO,"This ridiculous film takes the first 45 minutes to make this point:  Attractive people get more attention and strokes.

Duh.  I think we all know that.  In the entire film, there's about five minutes of actual discussion and analysis of why many gay men are body-obsessed and why so many don't put an effort into doing something more meaningful with their lives than looking good.

So the film is pretty much a waste of time - if you watch it for eye candy, you'll probably be disappointed, as the guys are not as hot as they think they are.  If you watch it to gain some insight, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1317513600,6,611,4.45945945945946
4237589,3,B00400L8XO,"This movie has a certain type of gay man.  And it is one that I'm glad I'm not.  Interesting to see a subset of people in a certain culture but after it was done, I was glad I wasn't any of them.  I don't deny that I try my best to look good (whatever that is, at least to feel confident).  But I'm glad that I try not to judge others the way most of these men seem to do.  I don't resent any of them, and I wish happiness for all of them but at the end of the day, it just seems like SO much unnecessary effort to maintain an image based on how others perceive you, based on looks rather than the content of your character.",1299888000,4,624,3.806201550387597
4237590,4,B00400L8XO,"Beefcake everywhere you look, and why? ""The Adonis Factor"" takes to three cities to investigate (primarily Los Angeles, San Francisco and Atlanta, with a side trip to Palm Springs). Director and narrator Christopher Hines is on his second tour of this turf after his ""The Butch Factor"" in 2009, which was broader in focus. In ""Adonis,"" he asks why big beefy men are the template for 'beauty' and talks to a bunch of them.

He also sidelines with talks with Titan Films, a plastic surgeon, a nude yoga instructor and a bunch of WeHo Twinks (who are all about ten years away from serious therapy). While the Adonises in the film fall into the spectrum of kind of sweet to genuinely annoying, it's the other interviews that shed light on the subject. The Goth Model Clint Catalyst is the most intriguing as a man who discovered his alternative nature and used it to his advantage. The trip to Lazy Bear is almost as interesting. One point I really wish Hines had spent more time on is the aging Colt Model as he muses on becoming the invisible former star. Which is amazing enough in the fact that he still looks like a million beefy bucks.

There are enough beefy men here of various ages (and several of them nekkid) to intrigue the voyeur viewers, but the underlying message is that the subset of A-Listers who cluster with fellow A-Listers aren't always as beautiful as you think. A trip into some smaller cities might have given the film more depth, then again, once goes where the pickings are best. Granted that finding poorly adjusted muscleheads in LA is like shooting sharks in a barrel, ""The Adonis Factor"" does a pretty good job at balancing the sexy and the smart.",1291507200,13,1674,4.614093959731544
4237591,3,B00400L8XO,"This film is about the pervasive attention given to a man's looks in the current gay scene. I identify the scene as the bars, circuit parties, street fairs, weekend parties, and gay-ghetto gyms of Los Angeles, Palm Springs, San Francisco and Atlanta as shown in this film. By focusing on about a dozen men who have found life pretty good by having ""Adonis"" credentials (or inventing them with extensive workouts, correct diet, supplementation including anabolic steroids, and plastic surgery), the film's surface message that such looks are superficial is countered by a subtext that these men are worth paying attention to only because of their physical appearance. In other words, the film buys into the stereotype it's trying to fight. Yes, a handful of men who resist the Adonis syndrome get profiled, but let's face it: the Adonises get the first and last look. Most of the Adonises here don't seem very pleasant or self-aware; it's hard to take someone seriously when he says the most important things in life have nothing to do with his looks after he's described the Botox injections and plastic surgery he's had done. Many explanations are offered for why gay culture idolizes men for their looks, but nothing sticks. The bottom line is this: when a man buffs up, other men pay him attention. I found the bonus feature interviews with the men profiled in the film (and the interview with director Christopher Hines) to be more interesting, relaxed, and insightful than the film itself. It is most suitable for mature audiences because of explicit content.",1290988800,5,1564,4.973282442748092

4237598,3,B00400L8XO,"The documentary chronicles a segment of gay culture in which the men place physical appearance on a pedestal seeing it as the primary door in which a gay man can feel validated and desired. More than half a dozen interviews of said group may leave the viewer repulsed by their highly superficial outlooks but the documentary also explores the ramifications of their obsession by interviewing plastic surgeons, dermatologists, therapists, and spiritual guides. The price to pay is clear - eating disorders, plastic surgery, depression, depreciating confidence and self acceptance, superficial friends, STD's, exposure to drugs and steroids. The documentary is a subliminal warning sign telling gay men that lasting attraction comes from a man's interior rather than his youthful exterior which will fade over time. Most of us all ready know this but the documentary is worth viewing to see the extent of the obsession as well as inspiring insights from those who except themselves for who they are with rolls, crows feet, average proportions and middle age. To be balanced it is also made clear that body image naturally plays into attraction and can open the door to meaningful lasting relationships. If nothing else it opens the door to discussion between men to become aware of the dangers of image perfection. The one criticism I have is the over emphasis on the superficial boys in contrast to those offer who more insightful viewpoints on the psychology of why we can become obsessed by image perfection.",1364169600,,1509,5.138211382113822
4237599,5,B00400L8XO,"I just watched this on NetFlix and I'm here to purchase a copy for my collection.  As an openly aging gay man I was surprised at how well this documentary was.  It hits on the pressures of being a gay male in places like SF in the Castro or LA or New York.  There is an ABUNDANT amount of pressure, esp if your young and just coming out.  It's fatal to some it's so bad.  Back in the day (80's) I developed a very thick skin early on and what I couldn't handle, unfortunately,  I turned to substances with which to deaden my perception of what I couldn't handle or didn't want to face.  Clean and sober now for over 20 years, life goes on.  Back in the day I saw myself as just too different to really fit in to many of these groups that I wanted so badly to be a part of and I simply wasn't prepared to deal with rejection of it emotionally.  Now the pressure is even more so as there are even more sub cultures to deal with and it's not easy for allot of folks to deal with.  Folks who view this film as ""paltry eye candy"" with very little substance really don't know what it's like.  For folks that want a good documentary on what's going on in many of the gay sub cultures captured in interviews and yes visuals then this will be helpful to them in understanding.  I liked that many of these Adonises admit that it's not all about looks. It's not meant to scare guys but it is good to go in prepared for the pressure or just be strong enough to say ""I'm good the way I am"" and move forward.",1359072000,4,1494,4.04421768707483
4237600,5,B00400L8XO,"It is an interesting film and touches on interesting topics. I do not agree with all the conclusions the film presents, but it is well worth watching. Very thought provocative. Sometimes it is hard to hear some truths; the realization is that our gay culture is very superficial. If anything this movie has tons of great eye candy! Definitely recommend watching.",1338163200,,362,4.950819672131147
4237601,2,B00400L8XO,"This is an exploration of looksism among American gay men.  However, it's not the guys who unfairly lose out in this meat market; it's the guys who always get hit on doing the talking.  The interviewees do a poor job in critiquing the system that benefits them.  However, this work is for two-faced viewers like myself: the guys who lose out in this contest also get to look at all kinds of beautiful eye candy.  Everyone on either side of the camera or the audience needs to think about Audre Lorde's comments on the Master's tools.

Here's a standout example of the doc's mixed signals.  A beautiful, muscular Black porn star says something like, ""Gee!  When I go to circuit parties and other meat markets, I begin to realize 'hey!  There aren't too many of us Black guys here!'""  C'mon!  I don't know one single, gay, Black man who doesn't think about racism in the gay community and will he feel left out in enter predominately white gay establishments.  This is not something that would just come up 30 minutes into one's being at the spot.  Also, his statement is said with a ""Golly-gee-whiz!"" manner that I suspect is meant to make white viewers ""feel comfortable"" and not have to think about how their establishments kick Black men to the periphery on many occasions.

So yes, if you love He-man looking gay guys, then you should peep this.  However, no these men are not being sincere and might as well admit that they love being worshipped by the men who could never get to walk in their shoes.",1328400000,4,1504,4.563432835820896

As a very straight woman, I can only say that I wish straight men would take such pride in their physique! It's really a darn shame. too many straight, white men are total slobs , about their physicality and for their demeanor. They are really just crummy pieces of fat. It really helps me, to remember that I love gay men! I've had a couple of friends who were gay men, and they were absolutely the best friends of my life. But, needless to say , they weren't very good sex partners! But that's okay. because, really, life doesn't revolve around sex!
 MY friends were beautiful , spiritual and lovely human beings altogether. I wish people could just stop focusing on sexual orientation . Doesn't matter, none of it matters. All that matters is really how our souls connect to one another . For me , anyway .
 I enjoyed watching this , because I enjoy watching gorgeous men!

8411520,5,B00400L8XO,"This Documentory starts out highlighting and almost promoting the often shallow and pretentious gay circuit scene as it relates to the targeted muscular male demographic.  As the film progresses you realize the intention of this production was to let the participants speak for themselves and share their story which is simply a reflection of the world they live in.  This film exposes the harsh reality of what is really a self imposed prison of desperation to be accepted by other gay men.  The ""boys"" from West Hollywood which were interviewed was a perfect example of this and how when taken too far can lead to disorders such as bulimia and anorexia.  Sadly they seemed to think it was pretty funny and couldn't grasp how diseased they had all become. I'm really glad the filmmakers included a couple that appeared to be healthy and stable as well as a hyper masculine gay man that couldn't care less about the scene.  It helped illustrate that not all gay men are so shallow and some are actually pretty normal and desirable.  Finally the viewer is left to ponder why most of the hottest men portrayed are still single and don't appear at all that happy.  Funnelling so much energy into your appearance definately has its drawbacks.",1465603200,3,1238,4.784037558685446

The main complain of the subjects is exactly this. You may belong to the best group, avoiding the ones that cant get there, but where exactly do you want to get. The film avoids thorny themes, as to what means getting old in a society that abominates the older and just thinks of the moment.
There really happens to find beautiful bodies through the film, and the sole meaning is to show the biggest hips, even with the indiscriminate use of steroids (what is somehow masked along the film) but whats next. They aren't looking for an answer.",1445040000,,973,4.763313609467455
