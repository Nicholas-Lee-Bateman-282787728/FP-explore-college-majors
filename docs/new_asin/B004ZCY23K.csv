8449641,5,B004ZCY23K,"While I have not seen Ken Branagh's version of this excellent crime drama, the Swedish version of Wallander is a welcome relief from USA action focussed crime dramas.  The main character is a low key investigator not without his conflicts and occasional emotional outbursts.  The scripts are superbly written, plots are complex and well developed, and the relationships between Wallander and his co-workers are realistic and poignant.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy crime drama without the usual histrionic antics of US cop shows.",1400198400,,539,5.392857142857143
