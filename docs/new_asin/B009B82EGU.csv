5312349,5,B009B82EGU,"This is quite a good ova for the Shana series.  While I agree that it would have been nice to have the original english cast back it really doesn't detract from the overall story.  The three stories presented here are a nice break from the main storyline.  The first one, in which Yuji and Shana swithc places is my favorite of the three.  It is also the one which has the most humor in it as the other two are done rather seriously.  The second story is about Shanas appreciation of Wilhelmina and the third recounts the events immediately preceding the start of the first season.  Though the three stories aren't directly connected to each other chronologically they are a very good ""inbetween"" for the overall series.",1362009600,,720,4.6299212598425195
5312350,4,B009B82EGU,"Shana and Yuji have been through a lot together, but for some reason she is avoiding him. Wilhelmina also notices Shana's odd behavior. Wilhelmina and Yuji are determined to get to the bottom of it. They snoop around and try to get answers from friends, but everyone is in on it. Ogata, Yoshida, Tanaka, Sato, Marjorie, and even Ikei seem to be keeping Shana's secret. Wilhelmina and Yuji think something ig is about to happen, but they may be mistaken.

In another episode, Yuji finds a treasure that causes him to switch bodies with Shana. The 2 of them must find a way to switch bodies again before anyone notices. The treasure has a secret that would cause their body swap to become startling news if it was discovered. The last 2 episodes are a prequel to the first season. It covers a time when Shana was still taking the places of dead humans and had no social skills. They are actually a pretty touching little divergence.

This OVA was pretty much what I expected. These 4 episodes do not advance the story at all, but are fun all the same. The atmosphere of fun and character development in season 2 are carried over into this OVA. The voice actors are the same as in season 2. By now, I've gotten used to the change. I liked all the new voice actors before they did Shana, and I think that they do a good job in this series too. I can't say that this deserves 5 stars, because it doesn't really advance the story any; or have anything emotional or exciting involving the main characters. Even so, I really enjoyed Shakugan No Shana S, and I think every fan of the series needs to see it.",1359417600,4,1598,4.39527027027027
5312351,5,B009B82EGU,"A truly marvolus addition to the Shakugan no Shana first season.
Love how the character development continues along nicely. Can hardly wait till I get the second season to add to the story",1359417600,,188,4.7272727272727275
5312352,5,B009B82EGU,"i like the series but why is it only on blu ray and  japanese are they going change it? if they make it in english dub like the rest of the series it would be better. And i wonder if it going on dvd as well.

So is it all of the ovas on there then? well it said 110 minutes so i would think that maybe the case.",1348790400,,311,3.4927536231884058
5312353,5,B009B82EGU,"""The year of 2012 is the best year for me"" xD I always said to myself, ""When is Funimation going to release all the Shana in one year?"" Looks like it finally happen!! It actually took like ""7 Years for Funimation to release these ""AAA Grade Anime"" Reason I give Shana a ""AAA Grade"" cause the series took awhile to come out also it one of the best anime characters in history!! Shana is a Tsundere other wise in english term a ""Bipolar Girl"" What makes ""Shana"" a favorite character is that she doesn't have huge over rated breast, she is not one your typical shy anime girls, she always manage to fight her way through in ""TOUGH BATTLES"", She always likes to eat melonbread ""Morning"", ""Lunch"" & ""Dinner"" Seeing Shana eat Melonbread is sooooo cute >< and the fact ""Shana"" always says urusai to ""Yuji"" a.k.a ""Boyfriend"" is what makes Shana the best anime character around!!!

5312376,5,B009B82EGU,"I ordered this as a gift for my brother. I do not watch amines too often, but I have seen some episodes from this one. I enjoyed the plot, and the graphics are quite impressive. It was not just gore and blood and big knockers, but actually had a story and meaning. Because of going a more difficult route Shakugan no Shana has done very well in its genre.",1403568000,,355,4.159420289855072
5312377,5,B009B82EGU,I skipped over these episodes when i watched all the season of Shakugan no Shana and i kinda regret it now that i watched this. The OVAs where good the dub was great and the mini specials where hilarious. Definitely a good buy if you like Shana.,1395964800,,245,4.23404255319149

5312380,4,B009B82EGU,"Two of the episodes were heavy and one episode was pretty far fetched.  The heavy episode, I didn't understand if it happened before or after the series based on what was going on. . .

There are also mini series in along in the combo.  Very Japanese humor.

A great addition to the collection though.",1378771200,,301,4.418181818181818
5312381,4,B009B82EGU,"In 2002, Yashichiro Takahashi and illustrator Noizi Ito created the Japanese light novel series ""Shana"".

Published by ASCII Media Works from 2002 through 2011, the light novel series would receive two manga adaptations serialized in ""Dengeki Daioh"" and ""Dengeki Maioh"" and in 2005-2006, a PS2 and Nintendo DS video game and would also receive an anime series adaptation by J.C. Staff in 2007-2008 and a movie released in 2007.

A second season titled ""Shakugan no Shana Second"" was aired in 2007-2008, followed by a four-episode OVA in 2009-2010 and most recently, a third season titled ""Shakugan no Shana Final"" airing in 2011-2012.

With FUNimation releasing the first two seasons and the animated film on Blu-ray and DVD, the anime company released the four-episode OVA ""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" on Blu-ray in January 2013.

""Shakugan no Shana S"" features four OVA's with individual storylines that were released four months apart.

The first OVA titled ""Reshuffle"" revolves around Yuuji and Shana going through Friagne's old pile of treasure tools.  When Yuuji uses a telescope and looks at Shana, the two automatically switch bodies with each other.  Unfortunately, they lose the reshuffle object and now must try to find it and try to live life especially at school and pretend to their friends that nothing is going wrong, until they can do a switch.

The second OVA is titled ""Domicile"" and revolves around Shana behaving strangely.  With Wilhelmina concerned about Shana's behavior, she and Yuuji begin following Shana to find out what may be going on.

The third OVA is titled ""Overture (Part 1)"" and takes place during Shana's earlier days as a Flame Haze.  Shana has taken the identity of a Torch named Junko Ogami and tries to find out who may have killed her, but meanwhile learning more about Junko's life.

And the fourth and final OVA is ""Overture (Part 2)"" and finds out that Junko had a relationship with a boy named Yukio and a Denizen is now going after him.  Shana must stop and kill the Denizen before it's too late.

VIDEO:

""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1). It's important to remember that these are OVA's and are not TV series and thus there is an improvement on the overall picture quality. Characters have much more shading, art backgrounds are much more detailed and the film looks more vibrant and colorful than its TV series counterpart. Some scenes tend to be re-used, especially classroom scenes but for the most part, the animated film looks good with the newer footage or backgrounds featuring more detail.

AUDIO:

""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" is presented in English DolbyTrue HD 5.1 and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0. The animated film tend to have more dynamic range and better use of the surround channels compared to the TV series. So there is an improvement thanks to the lossless soundtrack. Voice acting is well-done on both soundtracks but its important to let people know that the original ""Shakugan no Shana"" series was dubbed by a Canadian cast from the Geneon release, while the film (and the second season) features an all new cast courtesy of FUNimation. But for the most part, FUNimation did a very good job at casting because the new voice actors are not so far off from the original Geneon voice talent.  The English lossless track has better dynamic range as can be expected since it has the 5.1 track versus the 2.0 Japanese lossless track.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" comes with the following special features:

  Shakugan No Shana-Tan G - (4:05) Featuring anime shorts with regular and super-deformed versions of the characters.  In Japanese with English subtitles. Came with the OVA 1 release in Japan.

EXTRAS:

""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" comes with the Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" is extra episodes for fans who have enjoyed the first two seasons of the animated series.

The first OVA is actually a bit significant as Alastor confronts Shana's feelings towards Yuuji.  Typically in the past, Alastor has not been to supportive of it but he realizes that these two do care for each other, they just aren't good at communicating it.  But it's rather interesting to see what happens when the two switch bodies.

The second OVA is interesting that it focuses on the relationship between Shana and Wilhelmina.  The relationship between both individuals has been more like trainee and apprentice but with Shana observing human customs, she's starting to show this caring side that Wilhelmina has never seen from her.  So, a little nice surprise between Shana and Wilhelmina in this episode.

And the final two OVA's are pretty much about Shana and her earlier life as a Flame Haze and lessons she learned after taking the identity of Junko Ogami and human customs and emotions in general.  But more or less prequel episodes before she met Yuji.

As for the Blu-ray release, as one can expect from OVA's, they are much better detailed and look better than the TV series.  Picture quality is good, while the lossless soundtrack definitely is much better in the English dub track as it has a better dynamic range courtesy of its 5.1 soundtrack versus the Japanese 2.0 lossless track.  And as for special features, there are no audio commentaries but you do get the Shaku-Tan special features and Japanese opening and ending themes.

Overall, ""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" are four episodes that revolve around Shana and seeing how her time with humans have affected her.  From her being around Yuji, her and Wilhelmina and her earlier years as a Flame Haze and getting to know the parents of Junko Ogami, the girl/torch that Shana has taken over identity.

We know that Shana has changed a lot since meeting Yuji and she is starting to enjoy the life that humans get to experience and this four episode OVA series is pretty much about that.  One should not expect anything too deep from this OVA series but if you are a fan of the series and have purchased the first two seasons and the animated film on Blu-ray, then you will probably want to give ""Shakugan no Shana S: OVA Series"" a try!",1364601600,4,6926,4.9189655172413795
5312382,4,B009B82EGU,"i gave crimson s a four out of five only because of the confusion in the time between the episodes. the first episode starts shortly after the end of the first season, but then in the last episode you see the events that lead to shana's decision to travel too misaki city!
