the story keeps it interesting. I enjoyed seeing Dina Merrill looking so great and acting very well, as always. This would not be on my ""must see"" list of movies, but worth viewing if you are fans of the headliners.",1374796800,8,359,4.070422535211268
4430038,5,B004MFFB4O,"I read the book, ""Twenty Plus Two"" in the 1960's and loved the story.  I saw in the 1990's that there had been a film made.  I looked high and low for a copy and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  I watch it over and over and it is still one of my favorite films.",1355961600,7,269,3.603448275862069

8435984,5,B004MFFB4O,"David Janssen was always great as a PI, cop, and fugitive. Twenty Plus Two has him playing a finder of missing people. Like Warning Shot, the film has great character actors moving the plot along. The plot is simple. Janssen believes a cold case isn't so cold and despite everyone telling him he's wrong, he proves he is right. Even if you guess the truth before the story has not progressed too far, it is a good B movie.",1417996800,6,422,4.3544303797468356

8435986,4,B004MFFB4O,I have always been a fan of David Janssen and this movie is as good as always. I think anyone would enjoy this older movie if they are into that. I certainly did enjoy seeing it again after all these years.,1391990400,4,206,4.048780487804878
8435987,4,B004MFFB4O,It wasn't his best movie but I liked it.  You can't beat the Fugitive or Harry O in his acting career.,1378080000,4,102,3.857142857142857
