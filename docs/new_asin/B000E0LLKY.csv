2476388,1,B000E0LLKY,"Total big waste of money. Wasn't the movie you wanted to see. The focus was on 50's rise to stardom-but it was a story about a gangsta who has really messed up before he was starting to achieve. The good life is NOT free. If you want to be rich-robbing banks won't do you. You'll be going to the big house, all right-Not in the Mansions of Beverly Hills, but to Prison! You can kiss your ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous"" goodbye. This Movie Sucks!",1131667200,8,448,4.22093023255814

2476447,5,B000E0LLKY,Great Movie Starting 50 cent and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje !,1471046400,,59,5.666666666666667

2476469,3,B000E0LLKY,"Im not a 50 Cent fan, but I was curious about this project and how he would do. At first, I thought this was a biopic, but after watching some of the extra features I understand this is an original storyline and some of 50s life events were worked into the movie. I thought he looked good on screen, and he was surrounded by a good cast and high production value, but . . .

This movie needed some editing. It felt reeeeally long. Many scenes could have been whittled down or even eliminated. Also, 50 provided narration for parts of the movie and, for me,  that diluted the feel of authenticity. His performance, while not the worst given by a musician-turned-actor, lacked spark. There were several intense scenes in the movie, but I didn't get a real sense of urgency from him. He was shown to be more animated in the behind the scenes documentary. If he had brought some of that energy to the movie it would have elevated his performance.

The movie could have been a decent gangster movie without the rap tie-in. 50 Cent could still have been the star. As it is, the segue from street hustle to rapper was awkward and over simplified.  Perhaps more foreshadowing and inclusion of hip-hop activities throughout the movie would have made the ending more believable.  I thought it was funny that one early scene featuring a young 50 Cent, had the character taping a picture of Rick James on his bedroom mirror. I didn't realize Rick was a big influence for rappers!

Fans of 50 Cent will probably enjoy the movie. At the same time, I doubt the movie will make him many new fans. Regardless, kudos to him for going for it. After all, hes going to get rich, or die trying!",1467244800,2,1672,4.465573770491804

2476550,4,B000E0LLKY,"A lot of people are putting down this movie for the wrong reasons, I believe. If it's not the movie you wanted to see, make your own movie. That's harsh, but I read a lot of reviews and always look at the two- and one-star ratings when so many others have loved a book or movie. So often the reviewer writes something such as: the director should have done this; the writer didn't do that, etc. Often they just give it a one-star because they disagree with the message. That's talking about politics alone, which is valid, but it misses the artistic value - were the shots good? Were the scenes good? Was the acting moving? Were the actors believable?

I came upon this movie by accident and just went along for the ride, knowing nothing about it ahead of time. I felt that Chris Wallace had real heart, and real dreams, and he fought to get his message out there. It showed his struggle, and how it's nearly impossible to become successful, or even support yourself, on your music. The music industry is even more corrupt than Hollywood. Now that there are so many indie labels, rappers have become producers of their own stuff - a very good thing, indeed.

Anyway, while it's not ""New Jack City"" or ""Hustle and Flow,"" it's a decent movie. Don't write it off because it isn't a documentary. Allow yourself to listen to the heart of it.",1432857600,,1336,4.471311475409836

2476620,5,B000E0LLKY,"In ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" , we delve into the basic idea of what 50 Cent's life was like (aka Young Cesear) back in Jamaica Queens, NY. He began crack dealing as a young boy after his mother passed away (he didn't have a dad). Thus, the violence, the rap, and the drama all began in this epic, explicit, and brutally honest flick about real-world tragedies of the ghetto and truly encapsulates the concept of ""Survival of the Fittest"". And 50 Cent by FAR is the fittest!

I could always connect with 50 Cent in a way. My mom passed away when I was 11 (drugs). Then I moved in with my Dad. He started a drug company that was designed to get people OFF of addicting drugs and medications and on to natural supplements. Since I miss a lot of school to work, (they understand), I spent most of my free time free-style rapping like Fitty did instead of doing my homework.

Whenever I feel like the work I do is for nothing in the end, or feel like my life is unfair because I work harder than other kids and don't have all these friends to play with, I just think of 50 Cent and everything he went through. And this one phrase - Get Rich or Die Tryin'.

But first, I think I'm gonna need a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HyperFocus-DRIVE/dp/B00J2GO0RW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HyperFocus DRIVE</a>&nbsp;cap.

The movie really gets you to feel the obstacles that 50 has had to overcome and how he got to who he is today. If you're looking for action, gang violence, and are interested in seeing the life in the ghetto areas and the obstacles that 50 had to face to get to who he is today then this movie is for you. Compared to Eminem, I prefer Eminem as a better rapper than 50 cent, yet when comparing their autobiographical movies 8 mile vs Get Rich or Die Trying, I actually preferred this movie just because the action scenes and gang-life are a lot more realistic and gruesome than in 8 mile. Coming from an Eminem fan, I'd say that this movie was definitely worth watching and very comparable to 8 mile, both were definitely amazing though.

2476677,5,B000E0LLKY,"Jim Sheridan (My left foot and In the name of father) is one the most talented directors of the cinema ; in this sense he is in the same road that his colleague Ken Loach: his concerns have always turned around the social issues, the oppression and the injustice.

Thereafter when he realizes in prison he's going to be father, he begins to distinguish an exit door through the rap. These songs are part of his own experiences in the streets.

2476707,4,B000E0LLKY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Amazon reviewers are real sheep. Everybody is bashing 50 Cent but very little of these rants posing as reviews actually speak about the actual movie. Let's get one thing straight. If you hate 50 so much that you cant even write a partial review on this movie don't review it. Im not fond of 50 as a rapper and as a person but that is a lousy reason to give this movie bad reviews.

Get Rich Or Die Trying is loosely based on the life of Curtis Jackson and based on that reason its pretty good. 50 plays himself and there are good performances from Terrance Howard as well as Joy Bryant who plays Charlene, Marcus's girlfriend in the movie. Bill Duke is pretty good as Levar the boss of the organization Marcus links up with. Adewale Akinnouye Agbaje is excellent as the ruthless Majestic. The movie covers Marcus childhood as well is how he became to be a rapper. One might question the authenticity of the story being told in this movie(this being the movie's real flaw) but as far as entertainment goes I enjoyed myself.

Its a shame when people allow the hapless trendies that run amok on Amazon, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes dictate to you what qualifies as quality movies. These weirdos think that defending awful movies that were rightfully panned like Freddy Got Fingered, Nothing But Trouble, Batman and Robin, The Musketeer and The Black Dahlia makes them hip and cool and not pathetic posers in dire need of a life. And as far as acting goes the last time I checked  Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Leonardo Dicaprio, Brad ""Musty Arm"" Pitt(overrated beyond belief), Casper Van Diem,  Chuck Norris were not real actors! To all of you reasonable people out there do not allow the circus freaks on Amazon, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to tell you what counts for good cinema because you will be disappointed every time. There are a lot of great movies that never made the Top 250 or gotten Fresh Tomatoes. Just goes to show you the bandwagon mentality of these pseudo intellectual rodents. And as far as the overly sensitive sheep go, I wouldn't waste time trying to reason with your schizophrenic a**es. Go fawn over the ever-so-overrated Quentin Tarantino like the spineless groupies you are.

2476708,5,B000E0LLKY,The movie has surpassed my expectations. It can be watched by any mature age group and show a positive message. This isn't about guns and drugs.

2476709,4,B000E0LLKY,"I sat back and watched it, and i was like ""hey...is this movie actually be'n a good movie...wow""

You look at the central character, and you might have reservations about rap music or atleast you might hate new hip hop being made these days, especially maybe from guys like 50 cent, one of todays new hip hop icons and poster boys.

And on top of that, when this film came out, it wasn't like he had been around from decades, like he was this tried and true rap legend. So a lot of questions come about when considering whether to even give this movie the time of day.

Is this some movie about some fake thug dude trying to look cool and glorify himself? or is about more than all that stuff, stuff we see common place with the likes of ""rappers"" like lil wayne and other b.s.

Well, i watched all of it, and it actually was a well done, likable, honest, heart felt movie. Its like the guys behind making this really took this project seriously, and delivered a movie you'd wanna own and watch again.

50's story, if you don't know it totally, is worth learning about, it will open your eyes a bit to who he is and where he came from. From a little boy, to rising rap star. A lot goes on in the movie. And though it wasn't as long as i would of liked, it went a long at a decent pace, though some events didn't take long to show the viewer, it didn't seemed rushed or anything.

50's acting gets the job done. I didn't think he was trying to act too hard or anything and the supporting cast really did a decent job, like Terrence Howard, who plays a friend of 50.

Its not a great great film. But for a movie like this about a 'thug', a rapper, it really did a good job. Probubly one of the best in this genre ive seen. And it has some memorable qualities about it aswell. Which i really didn't expect.

There is an emotional aspect in this film too, that really makes you care about the character, and that i didn't expect above all. So i think this movie is worth watching. Its decently put together, its NOT a cheaply made film by any means. It really is good. I enjoyed it.",1227139200,2,2078,4.164588528678304

2476713,4,B000E0LLKY,I would like to start by saying that i really enjoyed the movie. It started out cool with a good scene in the begining which lead to him being shot. I thought that they set up the story very well starting when he was a child. I could not imagin how it would be to not have a father and than have your mother raped and killed when you were only 12 years old. He did do alot of bad stuff in his life but for me i cant blam him i have never been in that situation and it is inspirational the way he oevrcame all those things and still was succesful. There were some spots with some action were someone got shot and you would root for them to get shot back. The thing is he got shot 9 times and still lived. Most people after getting shot 9 times would have given up on life but he fought through it and decided to turn his life around and work on his music. Prison it looked like helped him alot. Just being able to think that he is the most succesfull rap artist selling records wise weather you hate him or love him he is good at selling cd's. It was coll at the end how the people did not want to be apart of the crack community and they sided with 50. A truley inspirational story i think you should check it out.,1188777600,,1214,3.9390243902439024

2476720,4,B000E0LLKY,"Very loosely autobiographical, this film tells the story of the rise from hard beginnings of the wildly successful rapper ""Fifty Cent,"" who plays himself. In the hands of director Jim Sheridan (""My Left Foot,"" ""In America""), it also becomes a story of a man's struggle to find his father (or whatever his father symbolically stands for, his own identity perhaps) and to learn the value of family in his life. His mother is killed, and his childhood sweetheart taken away. Two characters who may be his father are feuding, and he ends up taking sides, ultimately becoming responsible for the death of one of them. As is usually the case in such hard luck stories, the hero Marcus manages to overcome long odds and win his way back to love and success.

As that plot summary suggests, the general story lacks originality, or a more flattering description would be: it has an archetypal appeal. I prefer the latter interpretation. I liked this filim better than the other reviewers here. To enjoy it you have to enter into the appreciation of rap music and specifically of Fifty Cent's deadpan mumbling style. He's a big overgrown kid, with a luminous bashful smile; at the same time, he is a dangerous gangster, a young man in his physical prime not afraid to trade on his charm. It's a charismatic combination, and Jim Sheridan does a good job of coaching Fifty Cent in the trick of conveying his innocence and his menace.

I also like this movie because it frankly crosses cultural lines, bringing ancient principles of storytelling and family loyalty to African-American gangster culture, interpreting this working underclass both to itself and to the rest of America. I think it's a big-hearted movie.

It's also a well made film. The violent scenes are tough enough to be believable without being gratuitous, and the film editing works effectively to underscore the movie's themes. In addition to Fifty Cent himself, who I think is charming on screen, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaie as Majestic (gangster boss and one of Marcus's possible fathers) is riveting. Terence Howard is also excellent in the role of Bama, Marcus's friend and manager, and Marc John Jeffries is well cast as the young Marcus.",1153872000,21,2197,4.916442048517521
2476721,2,B000E0LLKY,"After the success of 8 mile, it was obvious that hollywood would make a clone to cash in. The movie certainly looks very cheap, nothing spectacular, not even in the shootings.

The story is predictable 50 cents' mother is killed when he is young, he gets tough, kind of wanting to avenge his mom, becomes a gangster, then a better gangster because his mentor gangster is good at this gangster-job.

Predictably, 50 goes to jail, remembers his lost dream of being a rapper, though it was never clear that he wanted to be a rapper. of course he must fight his former crime buddies because no one can ""retire"" from crime, as we know from countless mafia movies.

In the movie as in real life, 50 cent IS a speech impaired rapper, he just mumbles through his songs. This is addressed in the movie, and for fans this brings value to the film, we see 50 struggling with his own lack of clarity.

There is a strange side-story in the movie that is not persued and does not add anything, which is sad, because it had real potential. In the movie, 50s mom is killed and until the end we don't know who did it, but it turns out that the two main suspects might also be 50s dad, and in the end it looks like his dad killed his mom, and there could have been some nice struggle in the possible dads over all this. In fact in connection with this side plot we have the movie's one ray of light: Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaie, who plays Majestic, the afformentioned good at gangsterism gangster. He is a superb actor, outclassing anything in the movie (including ""Bana"" played by the excellent actor from Hustle and Flow). If he was white he would be hailed as the next young Brando, he's that good. Sadly, trapped in this aweful movie he has to give terrible lines. His subtle struggle, not knowing if he is 50s dad, is drowned out, because one does not look for good acting a movie like this. I first noticed this actor in The Bourne Identity (the matt damon one), where he has a small role, but steals every scene he is in.

I found the ending the worst part, because as 50 finally makes it onto stage, the winner, the hero, stepping into the limelight, he falls totally flat. just a muscle bound guy with no expression, and oddly no pressence, inspite of his bulked up, schwarzenegger body. Perhaps this total lack of pressence is part of his appeal. Eric B. and rakim, where are you?

So if you love 50, you might get something out of this, otherwise stay away, if you are forced to watch it, keep an eye on majestic.",1153612800,3,2503,4.383620689655173

2476724,5,B000E0LLKY,"I'm not a big fan of 50 Cent. I'm not even, particularly, a big fan of rap. But, I did like Eminem's ""8 Mile"" so I gave this movie a chance. It's got the same formula basically...Multi-platinum rap star stars in a fictionalized version of his life story, with an uplifting message, and an odd director. ""8 Mile"" was directed by Curtis Hanson (who has directed L.A. Confidential and In Her Shoes), this film is directed by Jim Sheridan who (in the past) has is Irish and white. You may remember Sheridan as the director of ""In America."" Anyway, it's hard to say what movie is better; ""8 Mile"" or this, both films are very different...Both films feature surprisingly superb performances. Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent plays Marcus. We meet Marcus as he and his crew rob a small store; They all escape, but Marcus is subsequently shot on his way back home. The film jumps backwards as we see Marcus grow up with his loving mother, who happens to be a drug dealer, who ends up being killed. Marcus is sent to live with his grandmother, but ends up dealing drugs under the watchful eye of Majestic (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaie). But Majestic is just small time compared to Levar (Bill Duke, who looks like a black mobster), who apparently runs everything. Anyway as Marcus grows up he forms his crew, consisting of Karyl (Omar Benson Miller, who was part of Eminem's crew in 8 Mile), Justice (Tory Kittles), and Antwan (Ashley Walters). But, putting aside the drug dealing and everything; there's gotta be a love interest which comes in the form of a childhood girlfriend named Charlene (Joy Bryant, ""London""). When Marcus ends up getting arrested, his life is saved in jail by Bama (Oscar nominee Terrence Howard, Best Actor ""Hustle & Flow"") who becomes a friend of his and ends up joining the crew.

Roger Ebert said this film was ""A film with rich and convincing texture, a drama with power & anger."" That pretty much sums it up, but it's not cheap movie anger. 50 Cent is a gifted actor, you can see the pain in his face and in his eyes. Terrence Howard, as Bama, proves he's one of the finest actors around yet again. This guy holds your attention to the screen. Even if you don't like rap or you do like rap and don't like 50 Cent; This is a powerful, honest, and very entertaining movie.

GRADE: A",1151884800,8,2306,4.554216867469879
2476725,2,B000E0LLKY,"What do you think if you look at the following names -- Daniel Day Lewis, Brenda Fricker, Richard Harris. Pete Postlethwaite, Emma Thompson, Djimon Hounsou, and Samantha Morton? Pretty impressive, isn't it? These actors, all undoubtedly talented, have received Oscar nomination for their roles in the films directed by Jim Sheridan, the guy who did 'My Left Foot,' and 'In the Name of the Father.'

Now Jim Sheridan, for the reasons I don't know, decided to shoot a film based on the real-life tale of a rapper named 50 Cent. And instead of using the first-rate cast like Denzel Washington or Samuel L. Jackson, Sheridan decided on casting 50 Cent, or Curtis Jackson himself as the title role of Marcus, a drug dealer who later becomes a rapper. Perhaps Sheridan thought he could at least draw out the best thing that is in this rapper, or could show some unique perspective on the life of inner city by using him. And you know, sometimes rappers turn out very good actors like Ice Cube or Andre Benjamin.

Whatever his motive might be, the result 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' became a terrible film that would be easily a career killer for lesser known directors. Probably Sheridan will survive this mess that looks multiple car-pileups, but not 50 Cent who has no charisma, let alone the acting skill that is needed to make the character more interesting enough not to let us sleep in the theater. His rendition of the hero remains flat, lacking any emotional expression while he most needs it.

But more irritating is the cliched script full of stereotyped characters and all-too-familiar plot devices. I am not talking about the material itself, which is worth telling here, but the way the insipid film is presented. As to the descriptions of the street-life, they did it better in the early 90s, for example, in the works such as 'Juice' (1992) 'Menace II Society' (93) and 'Fresh' (94), all gritty dramas. For all its biographical elements, 'Get Rich or Die Tryin' has nothing to add except for the good supporting acting from Terrence Howard ('Crash') and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (TV's 'Lost').

This movie is basically the story of 50 Cent but on the big screen. 50 Plays Marcus a gangster struggling to make a living and make it as a famous rapper but being a gangster gets Marcus alot of enemies which winds him up getting shot. Marcus survives the fatal shooting and the shooting winds up getting him the career he always longed for to be a famous rapper and earn a big living from it.

This is a great movie even if you're not the biggest fan of 50 Cent the person this movie is still a great watch because it is very, very good. 50 isn't the best actor in the world but basically playing himself he does a great job.",1149724800,3,1019,4.09

Mr. Sheridan's has two Oscar award winners on his resume including; Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker for ""My Left Foot."" So I think he knows how to develop a script and film.

  This film is based ""loosely"" on the life of 50 Cent. The term loosely comes directly from ""The Making of"" as told from 50 Cent's mouth. 50 Cent said there were a few real events that were translated to the film; the handing over of his demo tape to a studio with his Beamer in tow, jail time and the obvious shooting with nine bullet holes. Other than that it was up to the Mr. Sheridan to make a useable script. Growing up in the harsh lifestyle of inner city drugs and gang violence gives you more credibility with the hip hop rap music genre. The rags-to-riches story gives situational relationships hope.

  Terrence Howard (Bama), Joy Bryant (Charlene) and Adewale Akinnuoye-Aqbaje (Majestic) are the most notable experienced actors that give this film some spark.

  This film is an okay rental. And if you're a fan of 50 Cent it is a must buy for your collection. But for the other folks this film will not change your mind to suddenly become a 50 Cent fan.

Movies that are based on the lives of others are usually predictable seeing as how they got to be who they are now. we knew 50 became a rich and famous rapper. How on earth did you expect the outcome to be different in the movie? and seeing as this is his first movie, acting will not be up to par with that of Will Smith. OK now that's done I can review this movie.

As you know this movie is somewhat based on the life of 50 Cent. the story unfolds as him looking back on his life. He narrates the entire movie, showing as to how he was brought up and life. the cast for this movie couldn't have been picked better. Terrence Howard acting overshadowed most of the otehrs by far. For the most part whenever him and 50 were in a scene together he took care of the acting for both of them. Not to say the other actors were bad. Joy Brant, Omar Benson Miller, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and 50 Cent's acting were all well done. Seeing as how this is 50's first movie you can't be to hard on his acting skills. It's just like making fun of someone who is just learning how to swim and is struggling.

The story itself was well played and written. Showing you how the drug world was operated and how people made it by day to day. And was only showed as predictable because it was based on a life people already knew about, even those who hate rap knew about 50's life for the most part. Many said it was a play off 8 Mile, and Hustle & Flow. It's be safer to say it was played off 8 Mile, but keep in mind that was also based on the life of someone everyone knew so the ending there 2 was predictable. Those who say it was a copy of Hustle & Flow also need to understand these 2 movies where being produced around the same time... so how much of a play off could it be when one movie was released into theaters only a few months earlier? Back to topic now... there were a few surprising scenes in this movie but in order to know about those yu need to either rent or buy this movie. all in all this movie did well on it's own. though critics gave this an unfair ruling. To be honest if yu hate 50 then you'll find ways to hate this movie. If you like him you will like this movie. If your indifferent then yu can really appreciate this movie for what it's worth. I myslef like 50. but i also enjoyed movies even before i heard him. I can honestly say that if I was indifferent i would like this movie. and once you see it you'd appreciate him more once you see what he went through. and if your one of those people who say ""he should've been shot more than nine times for making this movie"" your ignorant as hell! Stop hating on the fact he made money of his flow rather than his skills in rhyming, and learn to just appreciate the movie for what's it worth not who's in it.",1143676800,8,2945,4.084628670120898
2476740,1,B000E0LLKY,"Thank God I didn't pay any money to see this, although the two hours of my life which I will never get back could have been spent listening to great music or watching a quality film will be sorely missed nonetheless. Anyone with more than the three brain cells required to understand the remedial plot, cliche characters, and generally overproduced, over-dramatized, and extremely overrated pile of garbage that this movie is should already have enough sense to stay away from this ""gangster"" movie in the same laughable vein as Eminem's (another walking cliche) 8 Mile, but for those even the least bit curious as to whether or not this sad excuse for a movie has any quality to it, I'm here to confirm what any intelligent movie-goer already knows: this movie sucks.

Meant to portray the tough, crack-selling ghetto lifestyle of millionaire rapper 50 Cent before his rise to fame, while living in the slums of Brooklyn, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' makes a sorry attempt to match the intensity of Boyz In Tha Hood and Menace II Society, showing us just how hard 50 worked to get into the mainstream rap game and make a few million bucks. The story is filled with the typical cliche characters who are about as interesting as a pile of rocks, the movie's only redeeming quality being the scenes where we can actually watch them get killed. Of course there has to be the strained romantic relationship between the tough-on-the-outside but soft on the inside gangster rap guru and his childhood sweetheart, which develops with the same old, used-up plot twists as every other movie like this you've ever seen, all in the midst of young 50 Cent running the streets of New York selling cocaine and using up good studio time to record his pathetic attempts at hip-hop. And of course there is the end, which might actually be worth watching simply for the laugh factor, where our gangster-rap hero watches his drug-dealing mentor turned enemy get executed by his hardcore thuggin' friends right before walking onstage in front of a soldout venue. Extremely realistic. And of course there is no doubt that 50 Cent really did all these things, killed people, robbed bookies, and dealt drugs all over the Big Apple. Give it a rest Marcus, you're singing the same old song every other wannabe in the rap game has ever sung, and while the ""hardcore"" fans lacking any individual tastes or opinions in anything will probably buy the whole deal as nonfiction and will ""ooh"" and ""aah"" at all those genuinely gangster parts, just like the producers intended, I don't buy it for a second. I'd like to see 50's hack imitation of a gangster go up against Al Capone anyday. Or better yet, Tony Montana for that matter (since we're talking about fiction, after all.) At least Eminem's movie, as crappy as it was, had enough guts behind it to portray him as the white trash he truly is. Why can't 50 just be honest and make a film admitting that he's another ghetto-dwelling moronic failure who got lucky and scored a record deal?

I shouldn't even have to tell you to avoid watching this at all costs. But if you feel it necessary to throw a few brain cells into the frying pan of corporate ""art"" for a good laugh, you've got a solid two hours of laughter coming at you right here. Keep it up 50. There's still enough morons in the world to sell a few million copies of this.",1143590400,3,3350,4.638047138047138

Terrence Howard was amazing in this film and there were scenes with him in the film, which prove he is an incredible actor. I also do not find 50's acting as bad as others claim.

2476745,2,B000E0LLKY,"The agenda of each of the characters in the film Get Rich or Die Tryin is to make money and get laid. A quality that I can easily identify with, as I too, like to earn income and have sexual relations with the female gender.

Get Rich or Die Tryin is a fascinating, yet extremely predictable story that glamorizes the world of gangster rap. What is fascinating is that we are supposed to root for any of these characters. I found them all to be abhorrent.

The Story

Get Rich utilizes the tired scenario featuring a talented kid with a dream trying to break into show business, thus leaving the streets behind him. What is really sad about this movie is that the audience is supposed to like this character. Most of the film focuses on him earning money by inundating the city with illegal drugs, and eliminating his enemies with no remorse for anything he does. Not everyone enjoys destroying their bodies with drugs, Mr. Cent!

Orphaned as a child, Marcus (50 Cent, or Fiddy) continues in his mother's lifestyles of distributing controlled substances, ignoring his grandfather's advice to stay off ""the streets."" His goals in life, besides making money and romancing the girls, are to find the man who killed his mother (who he believes looks like Rick James) and to push his rhymes in front of a larger audience. I guess the latter is intended to be admirable?

Special Features

A short documentary on the making of Get Rich is presented here along with the theatrical trailer.

Overall

This film is demanding too much of the audience in asking us to feel any sympathy for these characters. I couldn't feel that I could identify with any of them, even though I do enjoy pleasures of indulgence. The only characters you can really feel for are his grandparents. They provide some voice of reason. Even in the end, when the character has broken away from his past he refuses to condemn it. The only people that can enjoy this film will be die hard fans of 50 Cent. The film Hustle and Flow which was a far better film, had a similar story that didn't attempt to make a hero out its main character. Get Rich or Die Tryin should have looked at this film for inspiration. The film was advertised as 50 cent's real life-story. My question is why should we like him? Maybe if the movie stared somebody nice like my home skillet Wayne Brady I could get connect more with the protagonist. This film is certainly not intended for children under the age of 25.",1142985600,,2455,4.5636363636363635

As for people who say that 50 Cent did a poor acting job, it wasn't that bad and I've seen a lot worse. Those of you who said the story was bad, you are retarded or someone who cant stand to see another man succeed.

His story is very said but at the same time he learns from the lessons that life threw at him which made him a better person.

Frankly I did not expect much from the movie, but when I went to see it in the theaters...I was suprised!!  I read the critical reviews and saw that even Roger Ebert gave it is thumbs up.  The movie is NOT Crash or Hustle & Flow, then then again it is not a John Singleton or Paul Haggis joint either.

50-cent is not an A-grade actor, but then who really expected him to be such.  Apparantly the idiots who are bashing the film merely because they do not like RAP.  If you hate RAP music, then why in the hell are you watching a RAPPER's film about his rise to riches in the RAP industry after breaking out of his hustlin' drug-filled post-teen years!!  I mean D**m!!

I teach high school, and watched the film based on student's input...(I feel the need to keep in touch with the younger generation, YES).  I can see how this might motivate a few of my ""thugs"" into reality.  Yes, they idolize 50 (some hate him...snitch), but overall, the movie showed a positive moral message about WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND.  If you work hard at something positive, you gain something.  If you work hard at doing something bad and illegal (easy cash), then you get what's coming to you...a quick DEATH.

I plan on buying the movie when it is released on DVD.  I would put it right up there in league with ""Paid in Full.""  Another movie that in which a rapper (Cam'Ron) plays a lead roll.",1141257600,7,1408,4.340996168582375

There are a couple of bright spots here though: #1) the camera keeps panning in on Fiddy's teeth and #2) Fiddy rocks a totally sweet pair of teeth for about half the film.

2476754,2,B000E0LLKY,"Thanks to his colossal debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin' and commercial omnipresence, everyone knows the saga of 50 Cent. The real challenge of his Get Rich or Die Tryin' (MTV Films/Paramount) film is to weave humanity into ""Fiddy's"" mythical journey from small time hustler to bullet-riddled superstar. Despite the assistance of celebrated director Jim Sheridan, a winner of two Academy Awards, and a talented supporting cast, Curtis Jackson the man fails to come through on screen, leaving the audience with what amounts to a feature length music video.

Marcus, 50's film alter ego, is left orphaned after his drug dealing but glamorously feminine mother is brutally murdered in their small apartment (there are no traces of the hardcore lesbian mom that the rapper candidly portrayed to the media.) Forced to move in with his grandparents, the youngster's rebellion and anger is palpable. Actor Marcus John Jeffries's portrayal of young Marcus renders the character real in a way that 50 never does.

As Marcus, the only emotion that 50 can convincingly convey is anger, anger at his grandparents, at his crew and at the world. When Marcus's brash street antics land him in jail and eventually in solitary confinement after a brutal shower fight scene, a guard tosses him a razor blade, delivering the implicit message that Marcus should kill himself. Never does 50's performance ever illuminate the tumultuous emotions that his character should be feeling in the hole, even with him narrating. There is no moment of heart racing fear that Marcus might actually be contemplating suicide-only the certainty that his character has the brute strength necessary to overcome anything.

Everything comes easy to Marcus, even in the midst of his struggle to change his life from gangster to rapper. He easily wins his girl Charlene, played by Joy Bryant, who seems too good for Marcus despite his street success and their childhood friendship. Charlene's unquestionable loyalty and almost conflict free acceptance of his lifestyle isn't realistic, particularly because she's managed to escape the hood's desperation. Bryant's Charlene is way too smart to remain with such a thug-even if the sexual chemistry is crazy.

Marcus is virtually untouchable as the film's hustling hero. He robs a high level rival drug organization with no repercussions and is basically left to his own devices after an attempt by his former affiliates to kill him goes awry. Though he relied on drug money as his sole source of income, after he goes straight, we never see him struggle to pay for anything from studio time to pamper money. Even his post-shoot out blacklisting at record companies seems inconsequential; 50 and his crew simply decide to start dropping mixtapes. Young Caesar (Marcus's rap moniker) is then immediately embraced by the streets. When the film draws to a close and Young Caesar/50 Cent the legend is born, nothing seems extraordinary about his rise to fame except its predictability.",1136764800,3,2988,5.154639175257732

2476759,2,B000E0LLKY,"In recent years, Hollywood saw an emerging generation of actors particularly from the hip-hop world.

Eminem made a lasting impression with 8 Mile, Dr. Dre made a flashing appearance in Training Day, and Snoop Dogg has made several movies including Bones and Soul Plane (both flopped). With the rise of a star in the hip-hop world these days, there seems to be a trend of have-to-make-a-movie-next. 50 Cent, who I honestly and without bias don't understand the hype that surrounds him, fails to leave any sort of impression in this film about his life in the streets, near death incident, and rise to fame. Where Eminem succeeded in engaging the audience with his life in the down under and how he crossed the line to public adoration and respect after a climactic rap battle, Fiddy just doesn't reach a climax nor attract cheers.

The movie starts by showing 50 getting shot about 10 times leaving him for dead, but only to be saved at the last minute by paramedics. Travel back in time, 50 is raised by a drug dealing mother who gets killed in front of his eyes. He's brought up by his relatives. Slowly, the little boy becomes a drug dealer, looking for a way out through rap. Earlier this year, John Singleton explored this issue with the incredible Hustle And Flow starring Terrence Howard who appears in Get Rich as Marcus's, 50's character in the film, eccentric partner in crime. However, Howard's turn in and the movie Hustle And Flow outweighs this by way more than 50 million cents!

All in all, Get Rich Or Die Trying, is not a great movie. It's not even a good movie. It's a movie I would classify as a special interest film. The only people I recommend this movie to are hip-hop lovers or 50 Cent fans. But for the movie lovers, this is definitely not the golden ticket of the year.

However, I must say that I was very surprised at the fact that the story kept me interested all the way from beginning to end.  For his first movie, I think that 50 did a good job.  It was very interesting to see how someone that was very talented (business or rapper) but had a horrible childhood and saw horrible things on a daily basis delt with the cards he was given and the choices that he made as a result of those choices.  He was truly a product of his environment.  I think that the fact that he overcame the only way he knew how was the story of many black young men and something that most black folks that grew up in the hood could relate to and this kind of stuff happens every day.  It is unfortunate that a lot of folks from different backgrounds don't want to try to understand that there are thousands of little boys just like that who live and die under these type of circumstances.  But considering the fact that it goes on all the time for years while those of us who have made it or don't have these kind of issues really don't want to be bothered with ""those people"" and their issues.  There is a lesson to be learned from the movie.  I think that the story line was better than 8 mile as well as the music.  I cant think of any other role that 50 could play after this because it was really just his story, his life and who better to play that than him.

It was just as good as hustle and flow.  I think that the supporting cast helped a great deal.  With the guy from OZ, Terrence Howard, and the old head and great actor Bill Duke,  it was great to see them all again.

Yeah, this is yet another film about how a guy coming out of ""da ghetto"" who becomes a big rapper and gets the girl at the end (in other words, an enormous ""8 Mile"" rip off).

We've heard ""Fiddy""'s bull**** story a million times. 50 Cent is *beep* intolerable. Mr. Hardcore Gangsta From Da Streetz that got shot in the face 9 times. Yeah, sure. He'd have no *beep* mouth to rap out of if that was true.

Why the hell does he need to make a movie about his experiences? I mean, even those who despise this no talent ass clown have to see enough of this his face on TV, and hear enough of his crappy music on the radio. Bleh.

If you're going to make a movie based on a true story, then base the movie on an interesting figure like Malcolm X, Henry Hill, Napoleon, Nixon, etc, not on some ignorant ""All I care about is hos and guns"" rapper who was not only dumb enough to get shot 9 times, but who is the latest throwaway ""gangsta"" who has been exploited by greed and power rather than talent and originality.

Oh, and I figured I'd mention that he can't act. He mumbles his way through the movie, and tries so hard it's just awful. Ironically, he's very good at miming his own songs in his videos. There are times I could swear I'd almost seen his lips move. Hmm.

I still can't believe Roger Ebert (a critic that I usually agree with) gave this film a thumbs up. Don't watch it, I did (went with my ""Fiddy"" Cent loving brother) and regretted it.

If you want to see a great movie similar to this one, go see Boyz N Da Hood, Friday, or my personal favorite, the Brazilian slum movie ""City of God"" (Cidade de Deus).",1132876800,3,1948,4.2771739130434785
2476775,1,B000E0LLKY,"Honestly, I don't give a rat's behind about 50 CENT. If being a drug dealer turned ""rapper"" made him rich, then more power to him. My problem with this is that when all this shooting, drugs, and all that bull gets glorified, our kids want to do the same thing too. Teen agers always want to follow everything they think its cool. Trust me, not every crack dealer has turned into a millionaire rapper. Alot of them have DIED trying. I ain't worth it.",1132531200,14,449,4.357142857142857
2476776,4,B000E0LLKY,"Okay all of you intellectual movie critics. Let's get to it. This movie was NEVER ""Oscar material"" so what the hell are you even DOING here? 50 may not go down in history as a great actor, but this movie was an autobiography - he wasn't acting. In my opinoin, if you want to go see 50, then go see 50; because that's what you get - Curtis Jackson/50 Cent. If you want to see Denzel Washington win an Oscar, then go rent Glory.  Hey ""Totally Sweet"", did you actually see the movie, or are you just expressing your disinterest for everyone to hear? The rest of you negative reviewers, did YOU actually see the movie, or did the ""drug dealer turned rap star"" plot cause your nose to tilt slightly upward? As I said before, this movie did not set out to conquer the box office, or even the critics; it's an autobiography. It's his STORY, not his MOVIE. He IS Curtis Jackson - not playing him. And no, this movie is not 8 Mile 2. 8 Mile was actually praised by quite a few critics, and Em showed us that he had more that he could add to his resume. But 50 is not Eminem. And he does not try to be. So don't expect to see the same movie. Just because you see ""rappers"" and ""drug dealers"" and ""hoodlums in baggy clothes"", DOES NOT mean that the more- often-than-not, poverty-stricken, hip-hop generation of PEOPLE today, are one-dimensional.

2476781,2,B000E0LLKY,"The central plot of ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" is an age-old scenario: A talented kid with a dream tries to break into show business.

Will novice rapper Marcus (portrayed by seasoned rapper Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) eventually get to stand in the lights, bust his rhymes and bask in the reply of applause?

Maybe. And if you can completely ignore the fact that, for much of the movie, we mostly see him earn his fortune by flooding his city with crack cocaine, and dispatching his enemies with close-range gunfire, then you might actually enjoy watching his climb up the entertainment ladder.

But if you can't get around those troubling character flaws . . . you're in for a long movie.

Imagine ""Scarface,"" for example, if Tony Montana occasionally locked himself away to tap out pages of his autobiography; or ""Superfly"" if Ron O'Neal took singing lessons on the side in preparation for an audition at Carnegie Hall.

At the story's start, orphan Marcus rejects his grandparents' guidance, hits the streets and prospers in the drug trade in the late '80s.

He earns stacks of cash, finds a good woman (Joy Bryant), dabbles in armed robbery and broods about the man he believes killed his mother.

The suspected killer, as it happens, is a dead ringer for the ""Superfreak""-era Rick James. The resemblance is so close, in fact, that Marcus bitterly takes to carrying around a photograph of the real Rick James, to stoke the fires of his anger.

The Rick James photo is a plot point that might fit nicely into an episode of ""Arrested Development,"" but here, in the context of a drama, it feels hilariously silly.

""Do you like Rick James?"" Marcus' girlfriend asks after spotting the photo on a dartboard; ""No,"" he replies.

Eventually, stints in prison persuade Marcus to try his hand at rapping, and his ambition is reinforced when he is shot nine times by a rival, but survives (that he sees the MTV logo as his life passes before his eyes would seem like a snide touch... if this film weren't an MTV Production).

In real life Jackson, too, took nine bullets and lived to tell about it. Surprisingly, though, this version of the events isn't very interesting or coherent: Character introductions are vague; the gangster politics are hazily sketched and the story is rambling and, at two-and-a-quarter hours, overlong.

As a musician-turned-actor, Jackson has some charisma but is a little stiff and awfully mumbly (which is kind of understandable since, in real life, one of those nine bullets did go into his mouth).

Fortunately, the cast includes Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (the gifted British actor who played Adebisi on ""Oz"" and now plays Mr. Eko on ""Lost"") as a steely-eyed, sword-cane swinging gang leader and also Terrence Howard, who's great as Marcus' hot-headed manager.

Good as he is, though, Howard's presence here kind of works against the movie. He was the star of July's ""Hustle and Flow,"" an infinitely better film with a similar plot. In ""Hustle,"" Howard's wannabe rapper wasn't a privileged thug trying to get rich or die trying; he was just a hard luck guy trying to make some good music before he ran out of time. ""Get Rich"" could've benefited by considering such a constructive urge.",1131667200,21,3206,4.847985347985348
