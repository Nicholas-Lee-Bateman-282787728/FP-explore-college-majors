4066461,5,B00347E2YQ,I have other DVDs and Books by Steve Murray and I am always happy with his programs. I bought both of his new DVDs Chakra Healing Step by Step and Aura Healing Step by Step off his web site and both are great tutorials for Healing the Chakras and Aura. I highly recommend both if you are interested in learning how to heal the Chakras and Aura.,1279324800,9,344,4.149253731343284
4066462,4,B00347E2YQ,I have used this dvd many times for my class in terms of what chakras  are. It is well done and easy to follow. If you need to know what chakras are I suggest this dvd.,1380672000,2,168,3.6666666666666665
4066463,4,B00347E2YQ,Very helpful presentation.  It gives stronger base rooting in using Chakra healing.  Worth considering in expanding your world in positive light.,1361059200,,145,5.857142857142857
4066464,5,B00347E2YQ,Lazy woman who after being overweight and chronic migraine headaches have gone back to using this video. Of course I am eating healthy and s l o w l y begun to exercise.,1360108800,,169,4.151515151515151
4066465,5,B00347E2YQ,THIS DVD IS DIFFERENT FROM ANY ONE I HAVE WATCHED OR PURCHASED. I FIND IT INSPIRING AND INCREDIBLE WITH ITS ART AND DESIGN. I NEVER TIRE OF WATCHING THIS DVD.,1359936000,,158,4.3
4066466,5,B00347E2YQ,This is as excellent as all of Steve Murray's other DVD's. I am a therapeutic massage educator and this makes Chakra healing easy to understand. Very high quality and well planned. Very enjoyable and easy to follow. I recommend this to anyone interested in Chakra healing.,1352505600,5,272,4.934782608695652
4066467,3,B00347E2YQ,This DVD on chakra opening explains the seven main vortexes. They do a good job of explaining the parts of the body that are connected to each one. I found it informational but not enough examples to use on yourself to open or clear a particular chakra.,1321747200,8,253,4.404255319148936
4066468,5,B00347E2YQ,"Being involved with Reiki and other healing methods, this video offers a straight forward approach to applying an interesting method of healing. It is an easily understandable way of applying a method of energy flow that has some interesting results. For the person that needs deep, intricate understandings- this video will probably seem far to short and incomplete, but for people (like me) who like- right to the point (start applying) this has a great delivery as a learning tool.",1306627200,6,484,5.0625
4066469,5,B00347E2YQ,"A great way to bring this much needed skill into your life. Steve Murray brings a slightly intimidating subject down to earth with easy to follow techniques, careful , gentle instruction. The production is well done and not glitchy or camera shakey.",1295049600,11,249,4.9523809523809526
4066470,5,B00347E2YQ,"This DVD is well made,and easy to understand. The methodology is very similar to the Young lion kabballah uses of color and energy work for the preparation of the metals. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.Mr. Steve Murray has certainly demonstrated his knowledge and technique as a Reiki Master with this work. I would advise all those on the path to acquire this DVD as I have done. As it will certainly help all to get to a higher understanding of themselves,and benefit in healing,integrative medicine. I use this knowledge to help others in the relief of pain.",1282176000,18,558,4.762886597938144
4066471,5,B00347E2YQ,"I also bought both the Chakra Healing and Aura Healing DVDs off Steve Murray's web site at a special price. If you are looking for a process and method to heal the Chakras and/or Aura this is it. Steve shows you how to heal your own Chakras and Aura and how to heal another person's Chakras and Aura in a step by step format. I recommend both DVDs.

8388242,3,B00347E2YQ,this is a good intro to healing chakras if you are familiar with chakra healing you probably will be disappointed.  I would really go with jane matti Smith's video of chakra's.  I think you get more from her.,1424304000,2,208,4.447368421052632

8388246,2,B00347E2YQ,Really bad camera work. I found it difficult to get through more than 15 minutes due to the background the constant spinning made me really dizzy.  I think you should look elsewhere  is you have problems with vertigo or seizures.,1395619200,2,229,4.7
