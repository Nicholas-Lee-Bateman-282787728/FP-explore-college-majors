To see it ""come to life"" reinforces the understanding of the written word. While I have seen some complaints of the quality , it is geared toward the professional and not to a tv audience. Those who are professionals will appreciate all the experience and knowledge shared. Those of us that are in the profession owe Will a sincere thank you for sharing his knowledge and sacrificing his time.",1497052800,,512,4.7

Filmed using a wide angle lens, you not only get front row access to classroom presentations explaining the theory behind the major aspects of the art and science of roof cutting, but also -- and perhaps more importantly -- the first-person view of a master at work as he carries out and narrates the various steps of that timeless craft.  Like all good pedagogy, this course provides both angles of reinforcement.  With hours of valuable content, your own practice will surely benefit.",1430006400,,660,5.083333333333333

7793551,5,0945186037,"Hello.  If you took the time in reading reviews of a roof framing video, then you obviously have a desire to learn more about it or how to do it.  This is the video for you.  Will Holladay, author of ""A Roof Cutter's Secret"", shows you step by step some of intricacies of the art of roof cutting.  I always wanted someone to show me how to cut rafters on racks and looking at diagrams didn't help much.  In this video, Will Holladay shows you not only how to do it but how to cut them efficiently.

I set a lot of trusses and one situation that always comes up is a California overbuild.  Before watching this video, it was string lines and a decent amount of time to build them.  Now, I can cut the sleepers, ridge, and valley jacks on the ground before the trusses are even set. The method I learned in this video has saved me a lot of time.  Thanks Will!

I believe that to be a carpenter you must be able to cut, stack and assemble a roof.  Today, most roofs are built as a truss system, but there is a lot of information you gain by knowing how to cut a stick roof.  You don't have to be advanced to watch this video.  You need to know standard terms and how to safely operate a skill saw.  The most important thing to have is desire.

Bottom line: You'll love this video!",1397088000,,1277,4.092741935483871
