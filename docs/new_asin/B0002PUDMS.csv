8299415,5,B0002PUDMS,"I have camped out in the Everglades, alone, in a Glade Skiff that I built. Watching Totch's ""Yesterday's Everglades"" makes me hungry for more. If you've any interest in the Everglades, Florida outdoors, or Florida History, this video is a must. I am not going to buy the other vids in this series, I'm going to buy the 6 CD set, to get it all, including the ""sweepings from the cutting room floor."" It's THAT good! What you will see in this video is history happening right before your eyes, re-created by one who actually lived it. I cannot recommend it strongly enough. While you're at it, get and study Totch's book, also on Amazon, as well as another, by Glen Simmons, ""Gladesmen."" (From that one, I built my Glade Skiff.)",1422576000,,726,4.549618320610687

His camp was re-created for the filming, and remnants still exist inside Everglades National Park. It's a bit hard to find, but if you'd like to see pics of what it looks like today, see @ [...]",1324771200,2,279,4.185185185185185

8299418,5,B0002PUDMS,"This is the best documentary I've seen in a long time,

even though it's centered just in one area, that of southwest Florida.

I never thought of that area even existing before, and

feel a bit quilty for not knowing.

But this video was an eye opener to the fact of many

things that happened back in that era in that area, and

that such an area still exists as well.  Everyone, I think,

should learn more about it, want to visit it, and they can

thru this video, and maybe even visit the Everglades in

person one day!

By the way, who is the lady/Ms Deborah in the video? :)",1144972800,4,581,4.1441441441441444
