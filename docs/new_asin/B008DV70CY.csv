8527030,5,B008DV70CY,"George Schellenger, Jim Abernethy, and Guy Harvey have created an intimate encounter with Emma, the tiger shark. Shark conservation is so long overdue. We can only thank these shark and marine professionals and enthusiasts for their contribution to the welfare of the apex predator of the planet. The only way to better experience Emma is to go visit her in person.",1368576000,,365,5.0
8527031,5,B008DV70CY,Fantastic film!  The divers relationship with Emma the shark is a step in the right direction to break down the irrational fear of sharks.  lovely to see all the talented artists and how the sea inspires them.,1357603200,,209,4.621621621621622

8527033,5,B008DV70CY,"This movie is very informative and well done. It should be viewed by every person that does not have this full story and information about these amazing Sea Creatures until now. The narative and the actual visual interaction between man and Shark, was beyond awesome. Seeing what communication and connection between the diver and shark was almost beyond unbelievable. My feelings about sharks and the horrible innocent killings of these magnificent creatures made my blood boil. I will send out e-mails to others I feel should see this as well as try to get school children to have access to this beautiful movie.",1343692800,,614,4.970873786407767
8527034,5,B008DV70CY,"I was thrilled to be at the World Premiere of This is Your Ocean: Sharks at the Newport Beach Film Festival with Wyland, Guy Harvey, Jim Abernethy, Shawn Henricks and director George Schellenger. While totally enthralled with the film on the big screen (Emma is HUGE), I could not help watching the audience reaction to this film that presents a totally different view of sharks. These divers swim confidently with the sharks at Tiger Beach and the sharks interact with the divers in a truly remarkable way . . . not hostile, not aggressive, but playful at times. This is not a one time occurrence, but happens constantly with these experienced divers. This is Your Ocean: Sharks is a rare and important look into the world of the ocean's apex predators that are being wiped out by very cruel methods. Support this group and their fine conservation efforts and (hopefully) there will be a sequel soon! Yeah Shark Team 6.",1341792000,,920,4.75625
8527035,5,B008DV70CY,"This Is Your Oceans: Sharks is different from other shark documentaries out there and is a documentary that many people are not yet ready to see.  The star of the documentary is an individual tiger shark known among many divers affectionately as Emma.  Emma is a 14-foot tiger shark and an occasional visitor to lucky divers who visit her domain in the Bahamas.  I had the opportunity to meet her in April 2010 with Jim Abernethy, featured in the film, and saw her swim up to Jim like a great cat meeting an old friend.  This relationship between Emma and Jim, built up over years, allows for the signature moment in the film between the two.

In the 1960s the world could not believe that men could interact in the water with another great predator - the orca, aka killer whale.  Welcome to the 2010s.  Be ready for the next underwater surprise.",1340928000,,846,4.526315789473684
8527036,5,B008DV70CY,"I saw a showing of this film at a special engagement in Palm Beach, FL to raise money for the Bahama's National Trust. In short, my long held perception of sharks was shattered. Emma, the Tiger Shark featured on the cover, steals the show. The film is both entertaining and educational, and appropriate for all ages. I had an opportunity to meet the Director, George C. Schellenger, Dr. Guy Harvey, and Jim Abernethy. These guys are the real deal. They are passionate about protecting our oceans and these wonderful creatures. I highly reccommend this film, and will be purchasing multiple copies for members of my family, and it's for a great cause. We need to get the word out, the health of or ocean depends on it. Remember, This is YOUR ocean!",1340668800,2,747,4.666666666666667
