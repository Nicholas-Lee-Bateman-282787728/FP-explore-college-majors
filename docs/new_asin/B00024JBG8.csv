It was ok...",1421193600,,82,4.125
8022134,1,B00024JBG8,"Blue Daniels, a convict who is getting of jail after a 5 year sentence, moves in with his loyal girlfriend.  After trying to find a job by phone for a couple days, he decides to go back to his drug dealing, blackmailing ways.

I really don't see the point of the movie at all.  A drug dealer getting out of jail and going back to the game, WoW, that's shocking.  He bullies and ruins other people's lives, YeP, that's new.  I mean, couldn't he have a slight ""Aha moment"" after visiting with his old running buddies finding that they are no longer in the game.

I almost gave this 2 stars because I was impressed with Ralph Tresvant acting skills.  But they made his character so self-righteous that it made me annoyed.  I was hoping that his problem with Charlie Robinsons' character had to do with a similar issue he was dealing with his fianc&eacute; and her ex or something.  But no, he was just very judgmental because he started going back to church.

And give me a break, the nasty attitude female barber who amicably agrees to go back to being friends with a male barber in the same shop after having had a physical relationship.  Giving each other a friendly hug of friendship was a little much.  I'm not saying it can't happen but it is not believable in that story line.",1295222400,2,1280,4.423076923076923
8022135,2,B00024JBG8,"If you want to see New Edition's Ralph Tresvant and Charles Robinson, the Black dude from ""Night Court,"" then this is for you.  I'm Black and lately I've been watching many low-budget Black flicks that have no redeeming features.  This one was not pure garbage: I could live with it, so I give it more than one star.

This could be seen as dynamic.  The person I assumed would be the main character was the villain.  I thought this was going to detail how hard post-prison life can be for ex-cons.  Instead, this was another flick that glorified the illegal fast life.

A red envelope service message said this would be a ""whodunit?""  However, the act that would raise that question didn't happen until the end and the matter was quickly resolved.

If you think this is going to be happy-go-lucky like Ice Cube's ""Barbershop,"" then think again.  This was darker.  I hated ""Trois,"" yet it made two sequels.  If you can stomach ""Trois,"" then you can stomach this.

The locations were cheap.  The acting was amateurish.  However, I liked that they showed men and women, people of all ages, people who embraced the thug life and those who abandoned it.

If you think a D is a good grade because it's better than an F, then you may like this film.",1275436800,2,1242,4.527027027027027
