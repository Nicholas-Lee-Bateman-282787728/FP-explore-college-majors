1924417,4,B0000DFXV9,"In a pre-9/11 world, THE TERRORISTS addresses the fears we all have of being victimized by self-righteous, insensitive terrorists.  Tame by today's standards, this little known vehicle for Sean Connery is an intelligently plotted and tense little thriller.  Connery plays the no-nonsense head of Norway's Security, called in when a group of British terrorists invade the home of the British Ambassador and hold him hostage, demanding release of imprisoned compatriates and safe passage out of Norway.  These plans go awry however when the British government discovers the drop point and the terrorists are forced to make a change in plans.  This change is orchestrated by a fellow terrorist, played with subdued relish by DEADWOOD's Ian McShane, who holds a commercial airline and its passengers hostage until the other group is released.

As in most British films of the seventies, the pace is deliberate but there is a good amount of suspense generated, and Connery is effective in his role.",1151020800,21,993,5.220125786163522
1924418,4,B0000DFXV9,"I wish I would have waited till the DVD came out because I paid $29,99 for the VHS tape.  But anyway, very good movie and Connery is at his best after the post 007 era.  He is more of a classy verison of Dirty Harry where he breaks all of the rules to get the terrorist but does it with charm!",1140825600,24,293,3.7868852459016393
1924419,5,B0000DFXV9,"This movie also goes by the title of Ransom in Britain. It is a tense drama with Ian McShane and Sean Connery (need I say more!!???). Connery is the head of a security force sent in to negotiate with terrorist holding an ambassador and his servants. The terrorist demand transport to the airport, where they learn an aeroplane has been hijacked and is awaiting the arrival of the terrorists and their hostages. Connery is determined to stop them at all costs. It is a taught game of move-counter move, with nearly everyone involved running their own game within a game, and Connery can trust no one. McShane is very believable at the head of the hijacking team, that has more than one mask he is wearing.",1038787200,7,704,4.595238095238095

1924425,3,B0000DFXV9,"20th Century Fox's 'The Terrorists' (UK, 1974) is a largely forgotten, thinking man's action/suspenser featuring some very good performances by a top-notch (mostly British) cast.  Connery is stolid yet commanding in the lead and the story, while generally by-the-numbers, is gritty and engaging, shepherded along adeptly by Finnish director Caspar Wrede.  As for Anchor Bay's Blu-ray release, much less need be said as no apparent effort was put into it aside from the transfer to hi-def:  It's the same lackluster print used for Fox's 2003 DVD (a fullscreen/widescreen flipper) without restoration to any noticeable degree, resulting in only a marginally sharper picture and enhanced audio.  No extras.  Movie rates 3 1/2 stars; presentation 3-minus.",1394150400,2,751,5.552631578947368
1924426,5,B0000DFXV9,"This is a wonderful and very difficult to find movie. Very British and therefore lacking the American ""Saving the World"" feel of the Bond Films. The movie is an anti-terror action movie. A terrorist takes the British Ambassador Hostage to free his comrades in England. His getaway is blown and one of his comrades hijacks a plane to fly him out. Sean Connery is the Chief anti-terror Officer in the Norwegian army and is tasked with handling the situation. The movie ends in an exciting and absolutely unexpected shootout.

Great screenplay and a very British action movie. It was partly filmed in Norway with great views of the country.",1393113600,,637,4.844036697247707
1924427,5,B0000DFXV9,"Great over looked movie with a good story and plot and twist ending. Connery kind of walks

much, they still hide in a sea of other people waiting to

1924432,3,B0000DFXV9,"This film is a carefully crafted melodrama, with an intricate plot.  Despite the presence of Sean Connery, the film avoids the action of the James Bond genre, and more closely resembles slower, deliberately-paced British spy movies like The Ipcress File, or Funeral in Berlin.  The plot concerns hostage-taking and airline hijacking, while much of the drama lies in the issues facing security personnel in these difficult situations.  The cinematography, which showcases snow-covered Scandinavian landscapes, is outstanding.  The twist at the end is somewhat implausible, but on the whole this is a tense, taut movie that holds the viewer's attention.",1281052800,2,651,5.545454545454546
1924433,3,B0000DFXV9,"Big fan of Connery, so I was looking for some other films since he's ""retired"".  This one was pretty good action/thriller with a twist at the end.  However, as a movie, it's in the same category as other forgettable action/thriller movies.",1242777600,,239,4.804878048780488
1924434,2,B0000DFXV9,"Bombs are going off in London and the government seems helpless to resist ? When was this film made ? Too long ago and too shoddily to hold much interest for anyone other than Bond completists, but considering how many of them there are in the world, hopefully they all find their way to this filler. The premise is fine. Unfortunately, it doesn't even measure up either in looks or scripting to a half-decent episode of ""Spooks"". There seems to have been ambition behind the project. There's even a paperback novel which, sadly, this completist also owns. Where did this one come form ? Sometimes Connery lent his status to film projects in burgeoning film-makers he trusted, though he knew he would not emerge well. See ""Sword of the Valiant"" for example, or note the fact that his name enabled the financing of ""Time Bandits"" to take shape. Perhaps there was a loyalty factor involved here. Connery's peformance is fine - a Scandinavian with the customary Scottish accent, as Scandinaians do. He is focussed in the role without being dynamic, but then the role doesn't demand this. A Friday night T.V. crime flic if you take it at face value. As a probably-thought-lost must-have in the Connery lexicon, worth its few bucks many times over. Interesting side-note is that the pilot of the hijacked BOAC jet was Norman Bristow, an actual BOAC pilot, and in fact the face and voice of BOAC in all those commercials of the era when BOAC was BOAC and all that implied. Presumably, his only foray into acting, and not really a stretch as he jams on those brakes. Sean in a fur hat. Sean in nay hat is always worth a look. A curiosity. Be curious.",1235433600,,1643,4.63013698630137
1924435,3,B0000DFXV9,In this 70s international thriller Sean's not the only heavy hitter on board -- Jerry Goldsmith scores and it's shot by Sven Nyqust. The pictures not bad -- Sean's temperament fits the bleak Scandinavian setting -- you can imagine him in the role of Martin Beck. (Although the cynical twist at the end does render his character a bit of a hothead.),1215216000,,348,4.629032258064516
1924436,4,B0000DFXV9,"Caspar Wrede's Ransom (retitled The Terrorists in the USA) is an entertaining enough cat-and-mouse yarn from 1975 if you have an hour and a half to spare, helped immensely by a commanding performance by Sean Connery as the Scandinavian security chief having to deal with a hostage crisis and an airplane hijacking by Ian McShane's terrorist. There are some neat plot twists, Sven Nykvist's cinematography makes good use of the snowbound locations and there's a strong Jerry Goldsmith score that helps drive the film along nicely, although it is rather disconcerting to hear John Quentin speaking with Malcolm Terris' voice in a particularly noticeable bit of dubbing. All in all, an efficient Saturday night thriller that doesn't aim high but does deliver.

Unlike the UK DVD under the film's original title, which offered the theatrical trailer, Anchor Bay's Region A-locked Blu-ray release has no extras - in fact, it's so barebones it doesn't even have a menu, simply playing the film on a loop with fewer chapter stops than the US DVD. The mediocre widescreen transfer is no better than you'd get from an upscaled DVD. Fox's Region 1 video is similarly extras free but is a better bet at the lower price.",1200441600,4,1208,4.9507389162561575
1924437,5,B0000DFXV9,"Decided to get the little unknown films where our favorite start, Sean Connery is involved. The Tterrorists is a rare find. Sean Connery plays the part of the head of security and has to get involved with terrorists demanding much in exchange for the hostages they are holding, a British Ambassador and his servants.

To make matters worse, the Ambassador has a heart condition. As the plot develops, we see Connery determined to make sure the terrorists do not get away with their demands. Connery soon finds out that not all is what it seems, for there are many involved in their own games. The end of the movie is rather interesting. We highly recommend this thriller, especially if you like Sean Connery as much as we do!",1196726400,5,725,4.6640625
1924438,3,B0000DFXV9,"I like this sort of film, which has extended bouts of dialog to create a genuine plot, along with a decent amount of action, just to keep it exciting. This film has that 60's British feel to it, although it was made in 1975 and set in Norway.
(warning ending slightly revealed next) The only thing I thought was wrong with this film was a rather perverse ending. Connery was set up to be the ""fixer"" of problems others created, but in the end, it seemed like the plan was going well, but Connery bungled it, causing someone to get killed, all in the name of some ambiguous ""higher"" morality.",1194134400,2,591,4.381818181818182
1924439,3,B0000DFXV9,"While the production all-in-all was pretty good, performances by an all british cast competent, the DVD is slightly disappointing in that it lacks the snap and digital sparkle of many newer releases. It is presented in a 1:33 aspect ratio, it lacks image enhancement values and the soundtrack is very weak-kneed. I enjoy viewing the movie, but it just fall way-short of many other offerings...if it wasn't for Sean Connery, I'd send it back.

8000908,3,B0000DFXV9,"If you'd soaked in Connery's various cool iconic takes on 007, but you'd been hankering for different dimensions of the man, you're in luck. 1974's The Terrorists (a.k.a. Ransom) presents a more subdued, less action-hero-driven Sean Connery. In this one, he plays hard-nosed, uncompromising Scandinavian head of security, Colonel Nils Tahlvik, who finds himself matching wits with a group of terrorists. The British ambassador to Scandinavia has been held hostage in his own home. London has capitulated to each of the terrorists' demands. And it's up to Colonel Tahlvik to take control of not one, but, two, hostage situations going on simultaneously, what with an Oslo-bound passenger jet having just been hijacked by what seems to be the mastermind (Ian McShane) of the gang.

Not much in the way of the splashy stuff. It's a slow burn melodrama, and Connery's Col. Tahlvik doesn't quite acquit himself as dynamically as did Commander James Bond. If you expect Connery to spring into action, well, he doesn't quite, at least, not until the climactic sequence. Instead, for most of the film, he schemes and negotiates and hems and haws and gets most his every move foiled by the canny terrorists. For their part, these terrorists have to be the most civilized, most second-chance-giving bunch of perpetrators in history.

There's a cold, clinical, abstract vibe to this movie, and a peculiar inertia, and moments that drag, and extensive talking. Yeah, there's an element of suspense, but it feels somehow muted - again, the sense of peril would've been heightened if the bad guys had offed someone or brutalized someone. It's almost as if director Caspar Wrede and cinematographer Sven Nykvist were pulling a sleight-of-hand with their splendid photography of Norway's wintry setting, kinda like ""Hey, folks, we know this story isn't quite the nail-biter, but, woooo, look at the awesome landscape!""

Connery, who commands whatever room he's in, isn't put to maximum use as, as I've said, he's removed from the action and delegated to strategizing and negotiating duties. In a film sparse on action, the one decisive action beat that takes place halfway thru involves his watching from afar as his operative attempts a one-man rescue. So what we get is bureaucratic Connery as his character has to deal with the ambassador's shrill wife who begs Tahlvik to capitulate with the terrorists' orders and with the panicky, covers-his-own-ass Minister of the Interior who threatens to fire Tahlvik if he doesn't fall in line. Yeah, Connery is still compelling because of what he brings to the screen as an actor, but the screenplay fails him. As a catch-and-mouse game, it's blah. Moreover, Ian McShane and John Quentin are polished enough as the two big bads, but, ultimately, they come off as these impenatrable characters. A bit more of a probe into their psychology would've better served the plot. For me, The Terrorists is a 3 out of 5 stars picture. Connery certainly pulls his own weight, and it's an interesting change of pace from his dashing secret agent days. But he could've used some help from the writers. This story needed punching up.",1434326400,,3148,5.061657032755298

Although shot in Norway, they only refer on screen to Scandinavia as if that were a country instead of a region.",1432857600,,438,5.2
