8297963,3,B00176G1PY,"The DVD contains all three of the Final Four games from the 2008 NCAA Basketball championship.  However, even though the games were broadcast in 16:9 HD, the DVD resolution is 4:3 SD.  So much is packed onto this DVD (Three full games along with all the pre-game broadcasts) that the DVD master had to be severely compressed, so the image is not very good.  I would rather have purchased Blu-Ray versions at the original high resolution for my big screen TV.",1335052800,,458,4.62962962962963
