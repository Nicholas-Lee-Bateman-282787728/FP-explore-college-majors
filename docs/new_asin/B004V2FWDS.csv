8442818,4,B004V2FWDS,"I watched this movie as a young boy and really like it. Mostly for the singing, action and pretty girls. If you are someone who can appreciate a movie regardless of the era it was created then this is a good movie to watch if you like romance and don't mind reading subtitles. Granted the English translates back then were not top brass. Its still a decent movie for people with enough brains to grasp the funky concepts.",1361232000,,421,4.410256410256411
