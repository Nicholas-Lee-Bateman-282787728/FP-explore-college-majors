172596,5,0966531248,"I did not buy this book but heard many good observations about this book.  I browsed around in the book stores about this book.  The pictures are fasinating.  That just shows us the power of human emotions.  Imagine.  The most dominant substance of humans and animals' bodies is actually water.  So, the research the author has is an interesting observation.  If we learn how to stir our emotions effectively returning ourselves to love, appreciation, gentle and kindness, it creates a nice, harmonic being inside ourselves and this emotional energy will spread over to everyone else around us too (Look.  If emotional energy can make such an impact to water, imagine how impressive and powerful it could be when we show love, appreciation and kindness to ourselves and others).",1125878400,40,778,5.0234375
172597,5,0966531248,"Excellent - and very interesting.

Interesting to the point, where I have tried out myself putting

labels with blessings on my water bottles.

It actually benefits the people that drink from it.

The DVD is more interesting than the book, since one actually sees, what goes on in the water. There is food for thought in

the Messages from Water.",1125187200,20,346,4.7
172598,5,0966531248,"It's a great work.  Very interesting.  Again, behind is quantum philosophy.  Yes, I do have some books on this subject.  Yet I would like to have more details, examples and related experiments.  What about on the crytals and/or (water)solutions of other elements in the periodic table?  Why not?",1122854400,11,295,5.041666666666667
172599,4,0966531248,"I came across Dr. Masuro Emoto's work after hearing him recommended by Gregg Braden.  I purchased the book first, and was so delighted that getting the DVD was a no-brainer.

The DVD is a simple presentation of how Dr. Emoto came to experiment with vibration through the medium of water.  We see that its not as simple getting the crystals to form as it may seem.  They use many samples of water from a single batch, and not all of these coalesce into coherent patterns.  I'm only surmising but it seems that the intensity of our degree of focus and intention dictates the clarity of the crystal manifestation.  So trying to replicate this experiment could be quite challenging.  I would have liked to have seen more stats on the failure rates.

Despite this, the visual feast of seeing the direct and instant impact our consciousness has on energy thru the medium of water, is fascinating.  In many ways the photo's provide an instant internal recognition of just how sensitive and powerful our biological bodies are to the vibrations in the environment.

Although this DVD is somewhat being promoted due to its subject matter being shown on What the Bleep, it rightfully stands on its own two feet.

Its great to see this type of wisdom being pioneered from Japan.

172600,2,0966531248,"I have the book and like it much better, more pictures and info.

Very disappointed in the video.  Did not like the Japanesee language and hard to read subtitiles.",1188518400,6,163,4.586206896551724
172601,3,0966531248,"A great deal has been made about the influence of chemicals on the structure of water. This documentary demonstrates purported effects of sounds, thoughts and even printed words on water. The technique for producing the crystals is demonstrated, but not explained. Indeed, there is a striking lack of scientific integrity underlying the demonstrations. For example, only some of the crystals from a sample look beautiful; most drops of water do not form beautiful crystals. Also, the crystals form as the frozen drop of water warms up under a microscope, not as the water freezes. Apparently, the crystals form as moisture in the atmosphere freezes onto the very thoroughly frozen drop of water. All this is without explanation. The documentary alludes to the successful use of specially prepared  water in the treatment of diseases, but provides no explanation. Still, as was said in ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"", if thoughts can do this to water and our bodies are 90% water...",1179100800,6,980,5.086956521739131

172603,5,0966531248,Simply amazing & interesting ! .. It makes you look at everything in a different way .. ! i mean water is a living thing !... they hear us ! and react with us .,1173744000,5,160,3.6
172604,5,0966531248,If you are interested in quantum physics and the way we affect all around us this is for you. It is amazing how we influence water and tells a story regarding how we are all inter connected in the world and beyond!,1172448000,11,214,4.119047619047619
172605,3,0966531248,Interesting science but japanese language made it somewhat annoying.,1171843200,,68,6.666666666666667

172608,5,0966531248,"This book will blow your mind.  If you believe in talking to you plants, you'll enjoy this, too.  Gives ""holy water"" a whole new meaning - i.e., it's ALL holy water.",1168473600,6,165,4.290322580645161
172609,5,0966531248,"Watch this movie first. Then Watch ""What the Bleep Do I Know?"" and ""What the Bleep Do I know - Down the Rabbit Hole"".  Very thought provoking. But it makes so much sense. Our bodies are over 95%. It makes sense that those molecules react to what they are exposed to. I just loved this movie and have shared it with many people, who in turn, loved it as well. Very much worth the time and money in my opinion!",1167955200,8,408,4.1
172610,5,0966531248,Sent this as a gift for my family and they loved it.  VEry inspiring!,1163030400,8,69,3.9285714285714284
172611,3,0966531248,"I have fallen in love with the science of life... however I felt this dvd to be a bit insipid. Perhaps it had something to do with the japanese to english translation (It seemed the english subtitles were rather condensed compared to the dialogue... by the way, I do not speak japanese).  I sort of feel like I could have made a better choice by buying the book rather than the dvd... I think I may pick up Alexandra Bruce's book (Beyond the Bleep) instead.",1146873600,18,457,4.376470588235295
172612,5,0966531248,"I had a wonderful information through the DVD. I have the book but have not read it, the DVD helped me gain knowledge quickly, saved me time also.  It is a must watch DVD, my kids have not read the book but watched the DVD.  It has helped my family understand the power in positive words to people,places and things.",1145145600,19,316,4.25
172613,4,0966531248,"Rather short, but very interesting.  Good video, good for little kids and big kids...had hoped there would be more scientific stuff in it, but it seems an overview or a summary of the entire project.  Very fascinating stuff...now I'll have to read the book!",1142294400,14,257,4.818181818181818
172614,2,0966531248,I love this topic as discovered in What the Bleep. However this book as a follow up is a disappointment. It is basically a documentary of how the scientists did the experiments and does not really expand on the significane of the findings or offer any new eye opening insights. The DVD is especially boring to watch. The book at least has some nice pictures.,1138665600,25,358,4.523076923076923
172615,4,0966531248,"This video was quite interesting and mind opening. A lot of it is in subtitles which wasn't a problem for me and it is rather short, just over a 1/2 hour. Overall though, a very interesting DVD.",1138492800,11,194,4.27027027027027
172616,3,0966531248,"Although the DVD is only 38 min long and probably not worth the cost of a dvd, the concepts regarding vibration through words to change 'feelings' is pretty amazing.  Worth a watch, but should be longer to charge as a normal dvd.  WIth the cheap cost of DVD's this should be included with one of his books.",1136678400,33,306,4.350877192982456
172617,1,0966531248,"hmmmm  Funny thing this was released on DVD and not in a scientific journal.

Don't waste your time with fake science there are plenty of real science out there :-)",1127692800,22,164,4.433333333333334
172618,5,0966531248,"After seeing the small bit about the research on Water Crystals in the movie ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" (another very good movie!) I wanted to learn more about this Japanese researcher and his work. That is why I ordered this DVD. It was a wonderful synopsis of how this researcher from Japan discovered the hidden healing messages that water has to share with us. It is truely amazing. This DVD is in English Language and also has some parts with English subtitles. It is a wonderful way to introduce people to this information. For those I have shown it to they were utterly amazed by it!",1127692800,44,591,4.481481481481482
7793887,5,0966531248,We bought this after a friend had recommended it to show us the power and impact of our words.  This man has no concept of Christianity or the Biblical statements concerning our words yet from a non-religious point of view shows the impact our words have on things around us.  He takes it one more step and shows the effects of music on crystals being formed in water.  The crystallization process from various types of music is very good and every teen ought to watch that part.,1500336000,,479,4.482758620689655

7793890,5,0966531248,"This CD is quite amazing for any to know more about human spirits as they really are. Thoughts formation, words and reactions are eventually revealed through Water Crystals. Humanity can indeed benefit much more from these revelations and adjust our behaviors with each other. For there can be only through Love in giving and receiving and endeavoring in sending positive thoughts and receiving much benefits in return.

7793891,5,0966531248,"This has to be seen to be believed! Water can be charged with our intentions and our emotions and our words and even by writing a simple label! I have been labeling my water ever since I first saw this (after watching ""What The Bleep Do We Know!?!"" DVD). I have bought this for family and friends as well as myself! It shows you an interview with Dr. Emoto as he explains how he made this tremendous discovery and even takes you into the lab with him as he shows you how this work is done as well as examples of water slowly evolving into crystals. Ugly words written on water will not produce any crystals. But beautiful words written, or beautiful music played will produce beautiful crystals! They even show you how a group of children and adults send their intent by talking to the water and compare it to regular distilled water. He slowly freezes each millimeter of water in a seperate petrie dish and watches it under a high intensity microscope, then before your very eyes beautiful crystals grow in real time! A must see!",1399075200,,1030,4.48404255319149

7793896,1,0966531248,"Harmless enough video with a fairly insipid message.  If you are a die hard New-Age junkie you will like this video.  If you are looking to enlighten yourself with some fresh and reasonable debate ammo for your not so enthusiastic New Age friends and family, this falls way short of filling that bill.

Pretty pictures and music to go with it, but can't recommend this one unless you can find it at a garage sale for about a buck.",1208390400,2,430,4.417721518987341
