1252754,1,B00002E240,"I saw this film with two friends.  We all agreed that this film was one of the worst films we have ever seen.  The dialog was trite and unimaginative.  The only pleasure we had watching this film was mimicking the actor's  repeated lines ""Oh my God! What are you doing here?""",948758400,8,275,4.333333333333333

1252756,5,B00002E240,"I saw this movie in the begining of a new relationship, and it mirrored everything i felt and thought.  I have never had a movie make such an impact on my life...I could only see it once, but I plan on buying it as  soon as I can.  It was amazing!",947808000,11,247,3.803921568627451
1252757,3,B00002E240,"Deja Vu had all the makings of being a classic.  The story is first class.  The acting was good.  The concept fantastic.  But - the score was non existent, the audio mixing very poor, photography equally dismal and the  editing - well it hardly existed.  This was a movie that could indeed  replace Casablanca but ended up in the Blair Witch category technically.  Further, inasmuch as I absolutely LOVED it, it is actually an almost remake  of another movie from the '70's.  Check out ""And Now My Love""  starring Marthe Keller and Andre Dusollier for a movie with very  interesting parellels.  (Available here and very much worth while.)",946857600,5,638,4.796296296296297
1252758,5,B00002E240,"I saw this movie in a small theater that only played lesser-known films. I was totally unprepared for how good this movie is. The acting is top-notch, there isn't one bad performance in this film. The scenery is evocative and  perefectly sets the mood of finding your true love. I wanted to go Europe  after seeing this. It changed my feelings about everything, marriage, love,  destiny, etc. This isn't some Hollywood movie dumbed down by stupid  executives. This feels real; almost like it could happen in real life. This  movie will make you feel warm and happy!",946512000,9,565,4.783505154639175
1252759,5,B00002E240,"If you want to watch a movie that will forever challenge your thoughts about love, marriage, fate,and life, rent this movie, or own it. The acting, the scenery, the screenplay, the music are beyond what Hollywood  can ever produce. My favorite movie of all time, surpassing Casablanca,  Wings of Desire, and even Blue. A movie for those who believe that it is  never too late to be who and where you really want to be.",946080000,10,418,4.546666666666667

I think that as of the second time I saw Deja Vu it has replaced Casablanca as my favorite movie ever.

1252773,4,B00002E240,This is a wonderful story that could have been told in a 75-minute film . That it runs over 100 minutes  is a crime The leading ladies hairstyle was about as hideous as I've ever seen. She's supposed to be in her early thirties but looks like she's almost 50 and acts as though she's 12. I really enjoyed the premise of the story and a lot of the dialogue about it but I don't think I'll ever be able to Fair hearing the White Cliffs of Dover one more time,1502150400,,456,4.010989010989011

This story had SO much potential but is lost in extremely poor dialog, lack of clarity and little embellishment.

I am left sorely disappointed.",1501977600,2,199,4.823529411764706
1252776,3,B00002E240,"The premise of the film caught my attention.  Yet, once I started watching it Victoria' Foyt's whiny voice began to annoy me big time.  Her over dramatic acting didn't help. Then Stephen Dillane's character acted as though he was on tranquilizers.  Enjoyed the minor characters.  The husband and wife, who everyone end up staying at their home,
excellently portrayed a couple who had been married a long time.  One of my favorite parts was when more people came, the wife said they might as well turn their home into a Bed and Breakfast, Bush's reply was that was why he wanted to put an addition on their home!  There are a lot of different believable relationship issues between various people that made the film worthwhile to watch.  The two main can relationship was the most unrealistic. Foyt's voice and how she acted almost made me stop watching several times.  Glad I didn't because of some of something that came to light right towards the end that I never would have guessed.  After writing this review I would give it almost 4 stars",1501891200,,1043,4.686813186813187
1252777,2,B00002E240,"I've lived in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem & Paris. That was my reason for watching this film. Vivid memories of the film locations, although they could have done much more. The film, acting, and storyline: 2 stars is being generous. The lead actress would do well to return to Acting-101.  Overacted, hysterical, neurotic. It was hard to get past all that. Also sad to hear what years of cigarette smoking have done to Vanessa Redgrave's voice. You can hear it in the deep gravelly tone & her laugh. In the outdoor scene with her smoking dressed in black & wearing a black hat it seemed as if I were watching a female Peter O'Toole at the end of his life.",1501718400,3,647,4.436974789915967

1252780,5,B00002E240,"Beautiful movie about finding one's other half with a twist or two in between. This is a Henry Jaglom movie where he gives his actors directions about where he wants the scene to go, and they come up with the lines themselves. So, as many of the conversations are extemporaneous, there is an air of verisimilitude about this film. Stephane Dillane is wonderful. He is such a nuanced actor. Watch it with someone you love!",1497830400,,421,4.626666666666667

1252782,5,B00002E240,"Love the story so much I can get past 'you know who's ' acting, or lack of ability to act. She was seriously awrful, but maybe the camera work contributed to the problems as well. I don't care. Love the story.",1479772800,,209,4.121951219512195

1252803,4,B00002E240,"I remember TV channel-flipping one Saturday afternoon years ago and finding this film.  Love this story.  Henry Jaglom made a number of independent films in the 1990s and 2000s about complex, creative women.  This film is written by his wife, Victoria Foyt, who also plays in the starring role, Dana, and American designer.  While on a buying trip to Jerusalem, Dana has a chance meeting with an older English woman who shows her a beautiful ruby and diamond pin.  When the woman excuses herself to the ladies room, and then never returns, Dana becomes concerned and goes looking for her to return the very valuable pin.  In her attempt to locate the woman, she meets an English painter, who she feels she has always known.",1459900800,2,723,4.744

1252808,4,B00002E240,"I really loved this move and I would have given it five stars were it not for the overacting of the actress playing the lead.  Stephen Dillane was amazing.  I know the subject matter is a bit tricky since the lead actors are involved in relationships.  It is a wonderful, quirky movie that makes you want to believe in such things as love at first sight and fate.  I liked the fact that it wasn't a fairy tale like story but rather a bit messy as one would expect for there are consequences involved when the fated lovers make their ultimate decisions.",1448582400,,552,4.382352941176471

1252847,5,B00002E240,"To me, there is something magical about this movie. It combines believable and yet intense romance, mystery and other worldliness, international travel (scenes in Israel, England and France), realistic but captivating and clever dialogue, and an array of fantastic unique actors -- including Vanessa Redgrave and her mother!  Even with all of these components a movie might not work, but this one does. It's like entering another world within this world, and it raises some essential life questions without ever feeling heavy. I highly recommend it.",1392422400,,549,5.383720930232558

1252850,3,B00002E240,"I bought this movie on the strength of Stephen Dillane's talents. Since I have never seen him do a poor job, I knew that at least I would enjoy his performance. I have never seen Victoria Foyt but I thought hey, so what? I'll try it out. In a word, she is almost a complete disaster! She appears to be demented....not just flaky but demented. Did she even know she was doing a film? She gives new meaning to the word ""emote"". Vanessa Redgrave was as usual beautiful. As for the ending, it was pretty predictable. I give Stephen Dillane 5 stars.",1382140800,3,544,4.3431372549019605
1252851,3,B00002E240,"Perhaps the biggest mistake of auteur director Henry Jaglom was casting his cold, reptilian wife Victoria Foyt in the lead role. She has the charsima of a tree stump and sadly appears ruinously in nearly every scene. This seems to be a film about two people who are each married to others falling in love with each other. It couldn't be lust....  Stephen Dillane is a good actor and is well cast opposite Stumpy. Most of the dialogue/scenes appear to be improvised. The luminous Vanessa Redgrave and the amiable Anna Massey come off best. The film feels long  -  its richness lies in those occasional scenes where the improvisations work  -  and the over-length is apparent in the interminable scenes that do not (Foyt again). Better for its parts rather than its whole  -  the truth strikes in the unpretentious moments while the wanking thumps on and on elsewhere.",1380412800,2,866,4.771812080536913

It's about seeming coincidences and ""chance"" meetings. It's about destiny of how two people meet and keep meeting each other in unsuspected places; and how they were really destined to meet and fall in love. The difference between Firelight and this movie is that Deja Vu is not as dramatic or as serious, but more lighthearted and fun!

Please see this movie if you love romance!!!",1335139200,,514,4.840909090909091

1252861,5,B00002E240,"Other reviewers have said very well why this is so superb and so rare, but there are a couple of points they didn't seem to touch on. (Spoiler alerts.) One is that the main couple would never have met if that earlier couple hadn't made the ""wrong"" decision and then had children -- a strange thought. It's as if fate had to miss its mark in order to hit a better one a generation later; or maybe the moral is that that which we can resist can't quite be fate? The other weird point is that I don't buy part of the plotline and yet I love this movie unreservedly (and while watching it I'm completely in love with Victoria Foyt, unlike some of the reviewers whose tastes leave me stupified). I can't really buy that the woman whom Victoria encounters at the beginning has been dead for years, or that a ghost can give a lovely pin to a real person, who can then lose it and get it back. But I guess, because we invest in these scenes before we know the whole truth, somehow by the time we realize what we've accepted, it's okay?
Anyway, I think Ms Foyt's performance is mesmerizing and amazingly believable, and that she is a rock star in looks and charisma. I find Mr Dillane's performance a tad too mild, though charming, and he seems not quite to match the sexual dimension that Ms Foyt projects... but these are minor quibbles. The scene where they run into each other outside the London house and are appalled to learn of each other's attachments is played partly for laughs but is so natural, so human, that it is one of my favorite scenes in all the movies. I also like that the movie pulls no punches and dodges no issues: we get to see both people go through the awful business of breaking up and trying to explain to their mates: the messiness of human life is not understated. The slight hint that the two dumped spouses might be good together is another hilariously ironic touch (are they starting to flirt?).
This is a gem, one of the best studies ever of the meaning of compatibility (along with Kissing a Fool), and don't let anyone tell you different.",1306195200,2,2066,4.3828125

As the plot develops the film sweeps you along to experience travel to various countries and cities: Israel, the cliffs of Dover, London, Los Angeles, and Paris! Another great feature is that the writer/director Henry Jaglom gives his accomplished actors free rein to extemporize.  This creates a very natural and dynamic dialogue between actors which is so refreshing. In this regard it is also worth watching/hearing the actors speak about this experience in the ""behind the scenes featurette"". I saw this film in 1998 and I have never forgotten it. Thus I decided this year, after searching high and low for it, to buy it right away from Amazon, so that I could have the ""Deja Vu!"" experience all over again :)",1260748800,,842,4.8068965517241375

The ""no script"" thing shows how important a script is.  I hope the director bagged that idea after this movie.  It is painfully apparent when Stephen Dillanes character runs into Victoria Foyt's character at the house in London, she just keeps saying ""what are you doing here?"" and Dillane doesn't respond.  The bedtime conversations between the old couple that owns the house are just plain weird and completely irrelevant.  I agree with the other reviewer that Victoria Foyt's character comes off incredibly whiney!  The other story lines - Vanessa Redgraves -  would have meaning if they were in turn experiencing some sort of Deja Vu but they don't.  I would pass on this movie, this director and certainly Victoria Foyt.",1195344000,6,857,4.895833333333333
1252878,5,B00002E240,"Film director Henry Jaglom has been hailed by critics as ""the definitive Hollywood filmmaker"".Jaglom and his real-life  actress/wife ,Victoria Foyt, once again team up to bring a startling and originally scripted and crafted screenplay to the screen. Anyone familiar with the Jaglom/Foyt team (LAST SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS) will again recognize the earmarks of their work which always tend towards multiple characters intertwined in almost ""reality-like"" situations and conversations making the viewer one  with the characters as  an invisible third party to the entire scene-cinema verite at it's best.

This DEJA VU,filmed in 1998,and not to be confused with three other films bearing the same title,is romantic,magical,mysterious and down right philosophical bordering on the existential! The term DEJA VU simply means ""the feeling that one has experienced something or someone before exactly as it is being presently experienced"".When deja vu is experienced it can startle,baffle and even ""creep you out"",but the fact that it is a phenonenon that is worldwide is undeniable.

Jaglom and Foyt's tale of ""deja vu"" takes a far more indepth and more philosophical road than the other films on this phenomenon as it asks the question, ""If two people experience the undeniable 'pulling together' that cause them both feel that they are indelibly linked somehow/someway, then do they act upon it in spite of life choices already made?"" This deliberately paced,well-acted and very intense dialogue-heavy script is a real find for lovers of the ""intimate"" film. This is a film,not so much of action, but of words skillfully set and spoken. Victoria Foyt and Stephen Dillane play the ""haven't we met before"" woman and man,Dana and Sean. The acting is so natural and engaging that the viewer is simply carried along in a very natural drift. The supporting characters played by Vanessa Redgrave,Rachel Kempson (Redgrave's real-life mother),Anna Massey (brilliant!),Noel Harrison and others make for a real two hour treat!.

The music choices of Franz Schubert's SERENADE and the nostalgic WW2 love song WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER are constantly interlaced throughout this film which was shot in Paris,London,Los Angeles and Jerusalem.

I absolutely refuse to give any plot away,because to do so would destroy the impact and the surprise  that each subtle scene contains.(I hope this entices you!)This film will probably not interest people who want ""action/entertainment"".This is a character study of one of the highest degrees that may well interest patrons of ""live"" theatre. The film poses alot of questions and asks alot of the viewer to think about the choices that we make,have made or maybe should have made. As a person, myself ,who has experienced and acted upon an undeniable ""deja vu"" several years back, I can only say that for me it only confirmed the truth of what Jaglom and Foyt postulate...and I am happy..very happy for having made that decision. Perhaps you will too!?",1177718400,7,2973,5.283898305084746
1252879,1,B00002E240,"This viewer came away from this movie with the idea that Victoria Foyt and her husband must have been very generous with the cash to purchase such great actors for such a silly little movie. A check of Victoria Foyt's ""acting"" credits at IMDb shows that she hasn't been in any ""real"" movies, only those that she puts on herself. Foyt can't act her way out of a wet paper bag, and repetition and loud lines don't compensate for a lack of talent when supposedly working extemporaneously. I love Dillane's work, and to give him credit, he did his best to stay professional in this odd story. His best scene, though, was the one with the doorway, when he could just act, and not have to (one imagines) suppress winces at how awful it must have been to work with Foyt.

I do like that Vanessa Redgrave and her mother Rachel Kempson together, but they didn't have anything to sink their teeth into. Anna Massey is wonderful wherever she is. But she was wasted here.

1252891,3,B00002E240,"This movie is 99% dialogue, and most of that dialogue is improvised.  Luckily, the actors are good at it, but the improvisation shows.  The other one percent is travelogue, and the scenes of Jerusalem, Paris and Dover add to the movie.

A number of movies have tackled the love-of-one's-life phenomenon, but the others used some kind of story to try to get the feeling across.  This movie merely talks about it.

The lead actress was actively off-putting.  I didn't find her whiney, just not particularly likeable, and certainly not attractive.  In any love story, the audience (or at least half of it) has to fall in love with the female lead.  The other half has to go for the male lead.  It was impossible to like, much less love, this female lead.

Bottom line: worth seeing once for the scenery, if you can get it for a VERY low price.",1165881600,4,840,4.54
1252892,5,B00002E240,"For many reasons, I liked ""Deja Vu"" and many of those appear in other reviews. But no one here seems to have mentioned and reviewed the special commentary by Henry Jaglom (Director)and Victoria Foyt (star actress) in the DVD. That is worth seeing because it is like having a second, complete film in itself.

Clearly, Jaglom and Foyt are very much in love, and to some extent ""Deja Vu"" is about them. At one point, Jaglom tells how he first met Foyt -- on the telephone -- and although each had other commitments and responsibilties, each of them realized the other to be the love of their lives. But most of the commentary was a lovingly executed version of artistic arguing about how the film was made and the concepts in it. I've been a serious film buff for years, yet learned a lot about acting and filmmaking from the commentary.

In the middle Henry asks Victoria does she think someone is watching the commentary before having seen the movie. Then he scolds the audience for this and insists they STOP immediately and see the the movie first.

Both the movie and commentary are fantastic, great entertainment (and even -- God forbid -- educational). The DVD goes beyond just the film ""Deja Vu"" and is worth buying just for the commentary.",1137715200,6,1246,4.6289592760181
1252893,5,B00002E240,"I love this film and have seen it many times. It has lines in it I've never heard before in any love story, though I've had this wonderful soul-mate experience myself and know the words by heart. It's the language of the soul that's captured here, and I think the characters reflect this soul-mate understanding perfectly, at least in the major love scenes between the lovely Victoria Foyt and the excellent Stephen Dillane. This makes it difficult for me to imagine anyone else in the lead role other than Ms. Foyt.

In fact, the movie would never have come into being without her and she deserves ample credit: she wrote it with her husband, who happens to be the love of her life, and vice versa, if their commentary is to be believed in the special features section... The relationship between Foyt and Jaglom was fated, as she was married to someone else at the time she met him, and consequently they both sacrificed everything to be together - and so far, it's worked out personally and creatively for both of them, including their two young and lovely children. Now what other actress could have stepped in and played her role with more insight, conviction and understanding? Keira Knightley? Hmmm.

What some viewers lament as her constant ""whining,"" I see as a reflection of the type of woman she is: feminine, vulnerable, emotional, and deeply upset and confused by this sudden turn of events with someone from out of the blue just when her conventional life was about to fall into place with her fiance. She's shaken by this and it comes out in her voice. What's happening to her is beyond her understanding at the time.

Speaking as a man, I love Victoria Foyt's maturity, being an older but hardly an old woman, and her classic beauty, and I particularly love her words in her last major love scene with her soul-mate. (I won't spoil the beautiful exchange by revealing it here.) For what I look for in a woman, she has feminine appeal in the way she's in conflict with herself, and she has feminine appeal in her emotionally vulnerability and the way she expresses herself when she surrenders to her lover and decides to give into having a life with him. I like it, I like it, I like it, because she's lived enough to have some depth of feeling, and appreciates it, because it comes later in life, though that's not explicitly stated in the movie. She also knows how to kiss and use her hands to express her emotions, which I love in a woman. I would find it hard to throw a woman of this classic beauty and emotional vulnerabity out of bed should I ever be lucky enough to have this soul-mate experience again.

This romantic ""fantasy"" is perhaps my favorite movie about fate, destiny and life's unexpected possibilities - ones that keep you hanging onto life and expecting the next great adventure right around the corner, including non-romantic ones. Whether it's a perfect movie or not is a moot point for me because what movie could ever exactly capture the real thing?... that special something so overpowering in its magnetic attraction between two people that they can only say `yes' to it no matter whatever else is happening in their lives. While it can turn lives upside down, and sometimes ends up being only an illusion, it may be the ultimate act of self-discovery that was part of their life's plan from the beginning, and this movie explores this gossamer line between fantasy and reality.

I think the movie may also have another message:  that sometimes you have to say 'no' to someone when you painfully realize that person isn't right for you, and only then is there room for the person you were destined to be with.",1136246400,17,3651,4.643962848297214
1252894,3,B00002E240,"Another cute movie about love at first sight, destiny, regret, and the responsibilities that follow.  The story's web of coincidences proves highly predictable as long as you're paying attention.  The smart thought-provoking dialogue pulled me into the characters' dilemma.  I couldn't decide know whether to judge Dana and Sean selfish or hopelessly romantic.  Like many other viewers, I found Foyt's character rather annoying... very whiny and spastic.  The cinematography is terrible.  I haven't researched whether or not this was a low-budget film, but I'm hoping it was because the cameraman zoomed in and out spontaneously without any real purpose or direction.  This drew my attention away from the story many times, especially near the beginning.

Despite these annoyances, the creative dialogue (most of it anyway) and feel-good, tear-jerking ending makes Deja Vu worth seeing at least once.",1122508800,5,900,5.518248175182482
1252895,5,B00002E240,"A film unabashedly romantic and in love with the concept of ""soul mates"". And why not? Is love merely a product of genetic attraction or blind chance? Jaglom accepts the idea of ""soul mate"" as a premise, indulges in a little mysticism, effectively utilizes an old standard (The White Cliffs of Dover) dripping with nostalgia, and in the process delivers a film that will be revered by those who are believers and reviled by those who remain skeptics. ""Paris? How cliche!"" or ""Paris because it had to be!""  Dana and Sean are soulmates but Dana is engaged to Alex and Sean married to Claire. Both relationships could be described as happily content,  but once Dana and Sean discover each other, being content suddenly seems empty. And so they are confronted with a dilemma: seize the day or turn away. In the film Citizen Kane, a reporter searching for the significance of ""Rosebud"" to a man that had everything is told thus: ""One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since, that I haven't thought of that girl."" And this coming from an old man! Jaglom asks the question, ""What if that girl was that boy's soulmate?"" And then the follow up , ""Should he have seized the day rather than wonder his whole life about what ifs?""",1106784000,5,1503,4.402877697841727

While watching the movie, I just kept wondering why any of these people would want to spent time with her, let alone, seek her out or leave their wife for her.

1252897,4,B00002E240,"Deja Vu is an intriguing film that is flawed but worth seeing, chiefly for the brilliant acting of Stephen Dillane and the original, compelling premise of the story.
Unfortunately, the lead actress, Victoria Foyt, brought the film down a notch in my eyes.  She is whiny and annoying, and doesn't have the kind of compelling presence the part requires. But then again, she is director Henry Jaglom's wife, so I guess she was a shoo-in!
I liked how the characters had to wrestle with their situation - while their attraction was immediate and undeniable, their loyalty to their existing relationships caused them to wrestle with their consciences and really delve into the importance of love, fate and personal fulfillment.
I had not seen Dillane's work before seeing this film, but have since found his acting to be of consistently high caliber.  He does not look like a traditional leading man, but has a magnetic, thoughtful quality that is quite compelling.
Deja Vu is an interesting, quirky film, that could have been truly memorable with a different lead actress, some script tightening (hearing the actors exclaim ""What are you doing here?"" over and over becomes really grating after a while)and editing, but it is still an enjoyable film that is well worth seeing.",1021161600,19,1270,4.985849056603773

This is not a cynical movie, but it is realistic.  It's not about fate, it's about being presented with opportunities and exercising your free will.  It's a movie about the suspension of disbelief and trusting something bigger than yourself.  It's about life sometimes being inexplicable and accepting that fact. It's all about taking chances, having regrets and living with consequences.  The acting is superb - most of the dialogue seems like it is improvised and this lends an immediacy to the film.  Now, this may be off putting to people used to the typical Hollywood do-not-deviate-from-the-script approach to acting, but please just trust it and allow yourself to become involved.  The main characters - Sean and Dana - have to make some hard choices when they acknowledge their feelings for each other.  Each is deeply involved with someone else and the people they are involved with are not horrible people. This is not a romantic fantasy where someone finds their true love, casts off their dismal spouse and rides off into the cardboard sunset.  This is real life, in all shades of black, white and grey.  The circumstances the characters find themselves in repeatedly would seem to suggest fate, but they know better than that - what happens is up to them, it's a choice and not an easy one.  Other characters in the movie have had to make choices in similar circumstances.  After watching the movie you'll know that no one can say which choices were ""better"" than any others - all the choices people make and have to live with are valid even though they may seem foolish or cruel to others.

This story captured my heart and kept me thinking about it long after the movie ended.  In fact, instead of ""White Cliffs of Dover"" I have started downloading different artist's versions of ""Where or When"".  There could not have been a better song to go along with this storyline of 2 people that meet that really feel like they've already met each other before.  That's always been a favorite theme of mine, from old songs like Dionne Warwick's ""Deja Vu"", and it's good to see a movie made around this theme.  And to throw in the storyline twists of the older woman with the ruby pin and who she turns out to be, it is reminiscent of the feelings I had when Christopher Reeve first saw Jane Seymour's picture in the film book in ""Somewhere in Time"" and realizes she is the old lady that gave him the pocket watch and said ""Come back to me"".  Highly recommend this for anyone who's a true romantic at heart.  You don't have to have graphic sex scenes and language for a good romantic picture: just good eye contact, body language and an engaging, nonpredictable storyline.

Dana admires a piece of jewelry the mysterious woman is wearing. The woman goes on to tell how she acquired the piece-and the story is a sad, tragic one. The woman excuses herself for a moment, leaving the item with Dana. Hours pass, and the woman does not return, which sends Dana on a quest to France, where the woman said she stayed, to return the woman's jewelry. This woman simply cannot be found, and Dana must get to England to meet up with her fiance, who was waiting to begin a holiday with her. In the process between France and London, Dana seguays to Dover. This is where the true magic begins. She meets up with Sean, who she swears she has met somewhere before-and Sean just knows he has met Dana before as well, but knows it's  just not possible. This is such a wonderful story,  from beginning to end. The characters are all believable, each star in this film did a wonderful job, it feels like you are right there with them, experiencing every bit of angst and joy they are-there is no over the top acting in this film, it  just feels true to life, and i love that in a movie. I would recommend to anyone who wants to  escape into a beautiful, romantic film to watch Deja Vu.",1504828800,2,1550,4.2087542087542085

Slow paced but well written dialogue, romantic music that exactly fit the story line, great photography,  great acting by all and a mysterious underlying theme of destiny saved..To me it is a movie to just sit back and enjoy the moment.",1503705600,,341,4.573770491803279

I stumbled upon this while searching for a film with a ""foreign vibe"" to it. This kept coming back to me.....
I can't wait to share it with my mother and grandmother, I know they will love it too!
What I enjoyed most was the reconfirmation of what I've always been taught and what I've always witnessed with people. ALWAYS be with the one you LOVE!!  Not what looks good on paper, or what everyone else thinks. Live life to the fullest, and always follow your heart. You won't regret it.",1503187200,,515,4.364583333333333

Stephen Dillane and Vanessa Regrave are the only two people who should be allowed to talk in this film, except for the old couple who own the inn because they were adorable. The ending didn't shock me because I guessed it, along with many other small details that were later explained. I wouldn't watch this movie again, but the idea of the movie was pretty good.",1502755200,,410,4.63013698630137
