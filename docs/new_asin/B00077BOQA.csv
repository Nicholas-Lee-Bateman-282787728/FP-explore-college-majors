8045434,4,B00077BOQA,1983 Reno casinos and the Truckee river. Just add Kevin Costner and you have a fun movie,1512864000,,88,4.235294117647059
8045435,3,B00077BOQA,"This is not a very well made movie, but I still enjoyed it well enough to recommend. It was interesting to see Costner before he developed all his effects and affectations.  Many of the other characters were good ideas, but not very well developed. And the sequence of actions mostly was quite predictable. Still, I thought it had its pleasures if you don't expect it to be more than it is.",1510358400,,390,4.492957746478873
8045436,1,B00077BOQA,"Love Kevin Costner but never thought I would see him in such bad movie; bad acting (not only him) and crappy plot, I would pull this movie from planet earth if I was him.",1510099200,,170,4.029411764705882
8045437,5,B00077BOQA,"One of those movies that takes me back to childhood, just learning how the play cards and going to Deadwood and Vegas pretending to me the best shark in town.  And a great Justice movie, kinda in the Spirit of The A Team.",1493078400,,221,4.1395348837209305
8045438,5,B00077BOQA,"One of Kevin's first movies.  Not HD, of course, but good for his early work.",1442448000,,77,4.133333333333334
8045439,5,B00077BOQA,"This is an early Costner film.  I did watch it, and I believe his character gets killed off at some point.",1402704000,,106,4.0476190476190474
8045440,3,B00077BOQA,"I bought this dvd because I worked on this film for a few days as an extra in a couple of the blackjack table scenes towards the end of the film. Did not get paid more than $50 for 2 days work, but I DID get a nifty ""Double Down "" T-shirt (Double Down was the original name of this film. It was subsequently re-named Stacy's Knights several years ago, and then again re-named The Touch, for reasons unknown).It is definitely NOT an Oscar contender of any kind, but , at least I can point myself out to friends and say""Look, I've worked with Kevin Costner, you mere mortals!"" ""Kiss my ring!"" For a local Reno resident, it is quirky to look at The Peppermill Casino (the setting for all of the gambling scenes) when it was still just a one story building, taking up no more than 7 or 8 thousand square feet of property. Now, the Peppermill is 50 times that size and, come to think of it, so is Kevin Costner's career. I don't think he would've made it without my valuable contribution to this epic. No one stands still in a crowd of people, looking at other people playing blackjack, like me. Look out, Nicholson...I'm hot on your tail!",1386201600,16,1134,4.328638497652582
8045441,3,B00077BOQA,"Im a die hard Kevin Costner fan but I wasn't impressed with this movie. Its a low budget movie and an older movie, it was one of his first movies. Sizzle Beach was out before The Touch and they both are not anything like his newer movies. The Touch isn't a trashy as the other one.",1385424000,3,281,4.035714285714286
8045442,4,B00077BOQA,"THIS MOVIE WAS A SURPRISE TO ME SINCE I DID KNOW OF KEVIN COSTNER BEING IN IT, SO MUCH FOR MOVIEFONE LISTING ALL THE MOVIES A STAR IS IN. VERY EARLY MOVIE WITH KEVIN COSTNER BEFORE HE BECAME A MEGA STAR. NOT THAT GREAT BUT HAD TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION.",1341187200,,254,3.9038461538461537
8045443,5,B00077BOQA,"For the seller I am giving an overall 5 stars.  The movie is one of Costners earlier works formerly titled ""Stacey's Knight"".  I have it on video and it was a crappy copy from another seller on Amazon.  The DVD of ""Touch"" is in excellent condition and it came well packaged.  Thanks",1125705600,10,282,4.365384615384615
