This is not a business that you get to learn in any college, you learn by tradition. Most documentaries hype up the story with loud music that you can hardly get to hear the narrator. This documentary is different. There is no narration, fishermen talk, fish wholesalers talk and their families talk. You do not get statistics; you get facts, real facts, what it means to have oil in an environment where oil has no business. This documentary is about the impact of oil spills on marine life and the fisherman families' livelihood for generations to come.

Average life span of Exxon Valdez worker was 51 year old. Infact, everyone who worked on the cleanup of Exxon Valdez is dead. OSHA does not recognize colds or flues which are the hazards of oil spill cleanup. That one sentence which allows the spiller not to report colds and flues releases any oil company from any chemical induced illness which is not recognized by OSHA. Exxon was able to reduce the five billion dollar liability to five hundred million after some twenty years of court proceeding and a final Supreme Court decision which paid ten cents on the dollar to the fishermen. Once again, after some twenty years of legal proceeding with fishermen pilling up huge financial bills, debts and still millions of gallons of oil all around Valdez, some one foot below the grade. Oil industry learned that controlling the images means limiting liability since public perception is everything. That twenty billion dollar by BP in Gulf is down to five billion dollars due to lessons learned by oil companies not by the residents of this country.

Delusion is a solution to pollution. Fishing is the second oldest profession in the world. How oil industry, coast guard, governors, presidents work together against one industry like fishing and a clean environment and a healthy marine life is what this documentary is all about without any fan fair. Painful, emotional and a sad reality of human greed although the ones in charge happen to be the Democrats, the environmental group. What an absolute joke, Gores writes about issues which he has no knowledge of and gets hundreds of five star reviews but oil spills and fishermen get none.",1369094400,5,2428,4.73758865248227
8545925,4,B00A0O443K,"This DVD for me is full of information about the cleanup operation and the impact that the oil spill had on all those who were involved , but more importantly it is a documentary about the manipulation of how the public are presented with information by corperate America to control their comprehension of what is happening . To learn how you are being presented with controled story by both the Government and corperations , to make you feel all is well .
To see how these people lie and control with image control is asstounding .
If you are interested in how you as a human is being played , this is the one",1369008000,3,610,4.359649122807017
