8398959,2,B003KW15OU,"If you like lots of sexual innuendo ""sit-com"" style comedy, then this 8-part series is for you.  The biggest thing I loathed was the constant and incessant ""old-tech"" canned laughter.  No matter what was going on, funny or not, there was ""old-tech"" canned laughter. Yuck!

Yes, hippies did smoke cigarettes, but there is this one dude in the series that smoked as much as the canned laughter; Always a cigarette between his fingers and puffing away.  Did this have something to do with ""big tobacco?"" Maybe it's a joint.  I thought joints were held by the index finger and the thumb???  Whatever...

Some of the film was hippie related, and a lot of it was just plain stupid sexual sit-com related; Is this what British hippies did?  Now, all of that being said, there were a few funny moments, and British humour can be very funny.

I can't imagine that this is an accurate representation of British hippies, though there are some even worse American hippie films, such as ""Joe,"" that I would rate as one of the worst films of all time.  Oops, I forgot, this is supposed to be a ""spoof.""",1304726400,2,1088,4.590673575129534
