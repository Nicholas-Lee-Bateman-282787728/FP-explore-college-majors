8546538,3,B00A3TFHVA,"This movie isn't bad at all. Picture is at a 70% on quality and sound is about 60%. But overall it is gruesome in a few parts like I expected. Even though it's a VHS quality film. Some of the dialogue is corny and downright senseless but I'm not watching for the dialogue...only the violence and gore, which has enough to satisfy fans of gory jungle films. So I guess I'll give it 3 stars",1448323200,,388,4.1866666666666665
