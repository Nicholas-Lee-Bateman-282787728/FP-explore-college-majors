8099044,4,B000CGX7EI,"The Two Gun Man, 1931 film

This is in 1896 Carson City Nevada. Markham asks the Sheriff about the Billingham case, shot by the cattle companys men. The cattle company is shipping in 40,000 head of cattle. There isn't enough free range space to feed them says Markham. An argument over gambling leads to a shooting inside and out on the street! Miss Joan is in danger, a rider helps her out of danger. Blackie Weed of offered a job as a two gun man; so too his older partner Joe (who had good references). Men must hand in their guns when they enter the tavern [gun control]. They don't want employees shooting each other. Blackie sits at a table. Howdy Big Boy! Blackie orders beef, beans, and coffee. Did he sit with the wrong girl? Joe enters and rearranges the people. Blackie wants a fair fight, Joe keeps watch.

Then they ride out of town fast and find a place to stay. A mans barn burned down, he will be gone. The Sheriff gets a report from Markhams man Thorn about Blackie and Grandad. The two new hires will train Markhams men. Blackie shows them what he can do. Any more clothes pins? Blackie explains how he became a gunman. Joe gives a lesson. Blackie wants to be a peace officer someday. Does hiring gunmen create a problem? Joe discusses hired gunmen and marriage. A woman arrives to warn Blackie against danger from Sullivans men. Markham learns about the fire at Browns barn and orders a man to stand guard. There is a warning, but someone let the horses out! Thorn points suspicion at Weed. Weed is fired by Riggs, but Markham hires him back again.

Riggs is ordered to watch Weed. He finds Thorn instead, there is a conflict. Thorn plants something in the bunk house to put the blame on Weed! Weed was locked in the smoke house but escaped. The other men chase him in vain. Thorn awakes and finds a Deputy U.S. Marshall badge! Weed goes to Tollivers office in town and finds a ledger page with payments. Thorn arrives to catch Weed, but there is a fight. Weed gets away. Thorn tells Tolliver about Weeds status as a Deputy US Marshal; they ride out to follow Weed. Weed eludes them again, but is seen and chased. Weed dismounts and runs downhill, the others follow. Thorn climbs a hilltop to ambush Weed, but Joe stops him. Joe and the others arrived in time. So does Miss Joan.

This has a very good story, even tho some scenes were deleted to shorten the running time. Youll see women in the saloon, the later 1934 Production Code would disallow such scenes. This story was inspired by the Johnson County War of 1892 when the corporate cattle company hired gunmen from Texas to drive away the small ranchers so they could steal their lands. It failed because the small ranchers were united to defeat the gunmen. Other western movies used this for their stories, like Shane. Owen Wisters novel The Virginian was based on this historic event.",1509408000,,2862,4.508670520231214

Maynard bought him in the mid-1920's --- With his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and pair of six-shooters, from the 1920s to the mid-1940s --- Maynard appeared in more than 90 films --- However, his alcoholism severely impacted his life and his career ended in 1944. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors.

The significant amount of money he had earned vanished and he lived a desolate life in a rundown mobile home --- During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown admirer - long thought to be Gene Autry --- More than 25 years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to two small parts in films in 1970 and 1972 --- Ken Maynard died penniless in 1973 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California.

Our story line and plot, Marshals Blackie Weed (Ken Maynard) and Joe Kearney (Lafe McKee) posing as two-gun men, hire on at Markham's ranch --- They are after Tulliver (Tom London) and his gang of rustlers --- But unknown to the two, Tulliver has planted Thorn (Charles King) on the ranch and he kills the foreman Riggs (Walter Perry) and puts the blame on Blackie --- The Two Gun Man is one of the finest westerns produced by low-budget Tiffany Productions. Starring Ken Maynard, the man best known as the cowboy who taught John Wayne how to do his own stunts, The Two Gun Man features plenty of frontier action, from barroom brawls to desert gunfights --- Ken Maynard had been a major star in the 1920's famous for his trick riding and daring subnetwork. Unfortunately he had a few too many personal demons and his career steadily declined during the 1930s. This film is from his final solo starring series. He would re-surface briefly over weight and as nasty as ever in the 40s in Monogram's ""Trail Blazer"" with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele --- After that he basically ""retired"" from the screen.
