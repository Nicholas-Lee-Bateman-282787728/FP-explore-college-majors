4698622,4,B005GYXNIG,"This review is only for IF YOU BELIEVE, as I haven't seen the second half of the DVD yet.  IF YOU BELIEVE is a very comical and entertaining Christmas story.  The main character is an up-tight professional whose life is going nowhere, until she is confronted by her younger counter-ego, her younger version of herself, who brings about radical change for the good in her life.  Her younger version is always hanging around, prodding and poking the heroine in order to get her to remember how she used to be more carefree and fun-loving as a child.  The interchanges are often hilarious, and it's just a fun-filled story with a good ending.  Couldn't ask for more in a DVD that Amazon sold for five dollars!",1323648000,4,706,4.616
4698623,5,B005GYXNIG,"Christmas is my favorite holiday of the whole year.  I love the music and the movies and all that goes along with all that.  So whenever I get a chance to obtain a new movie to go with all those I have already, I take a chance and get one.  I chose this one as I had not seen the first of the two before.  I enjoyed both of them.  This was shipped to me in good conditon in a timely manner and I would suggest this seller to others again.",1323302400,7,438,3.769230769230769
4698624,5,B005GYXNIG,"I really enjoyed this movie! Though a little slow to start, it rapidly had my interest. Its for someone , anyone who ,for one reason or another, has been hurt, disappointed..and somehow that pain made an emotional impact and changed this person...closed their heart and mind. It is always good to see one come to terms with themselves and realize all the fun,beauty , and love there might be waiting for them if they unlock a very pained and closed heart. I had it on VHS, and so happy to now be able to watch it again. VERY enjoyable. The one character in it really reminds me of actor James Stewart. Hope you like it! I will be watching the other movie A DIFFERENT KIND OF CHRISTMAS soon and get back to you on that!",1319241600,24,718,4.325925925925926
4698625,5,B005GYXNIG,"This is a great Christmas movie.  The acting is superb.  The actor that plays Susan as a little girl, is great.  So many kids are annoying and try too hard to be cute.  She just was cute.  One can actually believe that she is real.  The story line about the book is good but the real story is about Susan and how fearful of life and failing at life, she has become.  Of course, since it is a Christmas movie, it has a very happy ending!",1458000000,,436,4.0

4698642,5,B005GYXNIG,"Two good movies for the price of half a movie; can't beat that!

  ""If You Believe"" is an excellent movie, set in the Christmas season and starring Ally Walker as Susan Stone, a very unhappy person, not just in her career -- she's a book editor, once upon a time a good one, now just about to be fired.  She doesn't get along with her family, people walking down the hallways or on the street or pretty much anyone who happens to be on the planet.  Ebenezer Scrooge was a happy camper in comparison to Susan.  She will, however, get visited by a very special personage -- no, it's not an angel or the ghosts of Christmas past, present or future.  No, it's going to be much better than that -- this character is just what she needs and is very enjoyable to watch working the necessary magic.

  The story is excellent, very different from others I've seen -- I've seen a few that star book editors (e.g. ""Wolf"" with Jack Nicholoson & Michelle Pfeiffer, also a very good movie) -- but this one is wrapped around that job of hers.  The movie is well written, very well acted, and fresh.  The story draws me in:  it's not an epic movie, nor a big-budget blockbuster -- it was made for TV, but it has my interest from beginning to end.

  The second feature, ""A Different Kind of Christmas"" is also a very good movie -- perhaps even more different than ""If You Believe"".  It stars a Santa who shows up in his red and white suit in a town with a moving van full of Christmas.  In short order, there are reindeer hanging off the roof, a yard filled with Christmas novelties, statues, everything you can think of that mean Christmas -- and the inside of the house has even more:  it puts Santa's workshop on the naughty list by comparison.

  And all of this happens in June.  This guy is dedicated to being Santa all year long.  The kids and their parents come by in droves and love him and the whole business; the neighbors complain to the city and he's shut down for ordnance violations.

  And that's just for starters.  It's not my favorite Christmas film, but it is a good one.  Very different story, a cliche or two, but nothing that I can't live with.  It's family friendly and full of kids, happy kids, and then there's that beautiful Christmasssy house and the war that's developing between Santa and the powers that be in town.",1419897600,,2330,4.376168224299065

4698644,3,B005GYXNIG,Both of these movies are more geared for adults and teens than for small kids.  The stories are different than you normally see and for a change of pace they are worth a watch.  Both are a bit slow and tend more to the drama side than the humor side.,1419120000,,250,3.98

4698653,5,B005GYXNIG,I have seen this movie on TV and so enjoyed it I had to have a copy. It has some great humor and some really touching moments. When the grown up susan kisses her youger spirit in such a loving and motherly way it really touches you. She goes from hating to deal with her young self to embracing her and changes her life.,1389225600,,320,4.015625
4698654,5,B005GYXNIG,"I bought the DVD because I like the film ""If You Believe"".  I have watched it a couple of times during the holiday season and have enjoyed it.  As of yet, I have not watched ""A Different Kind of Christmas"" so I don't have a rating for it.",1388707200,,238,3.9375
4698655,5,B005GYXNIG,I liked both movies If you believe  reminds  you of childhood  Christmas and how we sometimes get caught up in the adult life and forget about fun we had as a child .Different kind of Christmas was heart warming  and make all of believe in santa clause and miracles that can happen during the holiday season .,1388620800,,309,4.368421052631579
4698656,4,B005GYXNIG,I like both of these movies.  I haven't had cable for years so I buy Christmas movie I loved watching in July and Christmas time.  If you believe is the main one I wanted.,1387324800,,171,4.0

4698659,3,B005GYXNIG,Shelly Long was boring in A Different Kind of Christmas.  Can we say boring?  The movie was poorly made... we had to turn it off because it was so ridiculous.,1383264000,,158,4.233333333333333

4698662,5,B005GYXNIG,"I really liked both movies, but i loved If You Believe. It was super cute and was a great Christmas movie. I wouldve paid just for If You Believe, so A Different Kind of Christmas movie was just an added bonus.",1378166400,,210,4.146341463414634

4698664,3,B005GYXNIG,"I really purchased this pair of Christmas DVD's because If You Believe happens to be one of my very favorite Christmas stories. The story is well done and equally  well acted. I re-watch it every Christmas since the DVD was released. The second DVD, A Different Kind of Christmas didn't particularly appeal to me, and I couldn't really say what the reason is. It was worth the purchase price  to just get If You Believe.",1368057600,,420,4.586666666666667
4698665,4,B005GYXNIG,"I really enjoyed both of these Christmas movies mostly because they spark nostalgia from my childhood.  I delight in those feelings throughout the year, not just from Thankgiving to New Year's Eve.",1364342400,,197,5.15625

4698667,4,B005GYXNIG,"I love Christmas movies - no matter how sappy they are.  A Different Kind of Christmas was really sappy in the usual Christmas movie tradition but it has a good moral in that family is always the most important thing-even when you have been hurt by the ones you love the most.

If You Believe was different but good.  I liked it, but I like most Christmas movies so I have nothing negative to say.  Just the usual Christmas sappy love story that makes you feel really good at the end.  Which is what I watch movies for in the first place.",1362441600,,538,4.235294117647059
4698668,5,B005GYXNIG,"If You Believe sounded far-fetched, but the characters pulled it together nicely.
The little girl in the story carried off her part well as did the other characters.
Flashes of long-ago-Christmases intertwined with current conditions helped understanding.
I found this movie extremely pleasant to watch & look forward to viewing it next Christmas.",1362441600,,347,5.566037735849057
4698669,4,B005GYXNIG,"I bought this DVD for the Ally Walker movie If You Believe ( though I have watched and enjoyed A Different Kind of Christmas) I saw If You Believe on cable a few years ago and just loved it. A re-watch did not disappoint and although the theme is hardly new (a Scrooge like adult rediscovers the meaning of Christmas) the approach is fresh. Also featuring a young Haydn Panetierre and a good supporting cast, this is a fun addition to any Christmas movie library.",1361404800,,463,4.458823529411765
4698670,5,B005GYXNIG,"Don't we all need that check now and then? I watch If You Believe several times each year long - nothing wrong with Christmas in July. My dvd is old and worn so I am thrilled to find a new one with a bonus. Yeah it's a chick flick but frankly the world needs them. Nobody shoots up schools, teachers and little ones after watching a chick flick (just don't try to get ""him"" to watch 2 or 3 in a row). So try it - join Susan for Christmas (both of them) as they get out of NYC on a train to CT to edit a new writer and finds an attitude adjustment in her stocking.",1361232000,,563,3.8205128205128207
4698671,5,B005GYXNIG,"I rememeber seeing If You Believe Years ago, and thought the little girl would go places - and she did, of course, Hayden Panettiere!  It is a beautiful story and I would have paid the price for just that movie, but it also included another Christmas movie as a set.  Well worth the price and a great addition to your Christmas Movie Collection!",1359072000,,345,4.4603174603174605
4698672,5,B005GYXNIG,"if you believe - - great way to begin and end a movie.  a good lesson is to be learned as we watch - if we listen to our inner thoughts and feelings we can make changes in our lives, usually for the better.

a different kind of christmas - - this movie had different aspects, family vs political, love vs resentment.

both, in my opnion, were good movies as well throught provoking.  would recomond both as family friendly.",1358467200,,423,4.3164556962025316
4698673,4,B005GYXNIG,"I had never seen either of these so I went on Amazon reviewer's opinions. I'm glad I did! I wouldn't say they were 5 star quality but ones I'm sure I'll watch many times. I love holiday movies but not all of them are worth even watching, then alone purchasing. These were well worth the money! ""If You Believe"" was very sweet and touching. Perfect for the holidays. ""A Different Kind Of Christmas"" had a different plot, which is always welcomed, and Shelley Long was her usual great self. I usually can't go wrong with her movies and this one was no different.",1357689600,,560,4.446601941747573

4698676,2,B005GYXNIG,"These movies can be watched by the entire family.  If you beleive is a little unbelievable.  Kind of an inner child sort of thing,.

4698679,5,B005GYXNIG,"I enjoy ""If You Believe"" very much and had a ""bootleg"" copy, that wasn't too great, but watchable. Was very happy to see it finally released on DVD, but the second movie isn't one I particularly enjoy and wasn't needed. However, the price was right, so what the heck.

4698680,5,B005GYXNIG,"If you Believe was my favorite - coming to terms with your adult self can be hard - loving yourself can be harder.  But with the insight of the child inside of us all, it becomes possible - if we only listen!",1355529600,,208,3.9523809523809526
4698681,5,B005GYXNIG,I saw A different Kind of Christmas on TV last year. Our family loved this movie. It is about a women who is running for political office in her hometown.  Then santa moves in. Things get crazy and there are a lot of 'plot' twists.,1355184000,,231,4.133333333333334
4698682,5,B005GYXNIG,"These are tow of my favorite holiday movies. Allie Walker, a longtime favorite of mine, is terrific as a jaded editor who has lost her way. The scenary is nostalgic as you are treated to both a small town Christmas celebration and the exitement of New York City in December. A Different Kind of Christmas is a heartwarming story of a daughter who comes to grips with a father who plays Santa Clause year round.",1353974400,,410,4.48

4698686,4,B005GYXNIG,"I bought this DVD because I didn't see ""If You Believe"" this season.  I love this movie and try to catch it every season.  It has two great main charactors who are actually the same person!!  Ally Walker plays the older character and (I love her work) is great as the lead in this movie. She has lost her way; she is a tired and angry executive book editor who finally finds a great new author through her crazy fun loving assistant. The main character used to be fun loving, too. That's where her younger six-year old self shows up after she falls and hits the back of her head. The six-year old is played by the adorable Hayden Panettiere. Of course she thinks she's nuts and has herself check out.  She is seen talking to herself and is embarrased. You can imagine all the scenarios one can play out with your six-year old self. It's a really funny, engaging family  movie, with a little romance and a few welcome revengeful scenes with a snobbish,jealous, uppity, co-worker, who tries to steal her new author!!  Rent or buy, you won't regret it.  Enjoy. P.S. Haven't watched the second movie.",1328486400,,1096,4.505050505050505
4698687,5,B005GYXNIG,"I have seen and taped both these movies on TV, but it is great to have these on DVD. The picture quality is clear, and there's no banners or channel IDs to block the picture! If you like Christmas movies, you will love these feel-good ""chick flick"" movies. ""If You Believe"" also features a very young Hayden Panettiere. She was a cute child, but it's amazing to see how she grew up to become the beauty she now is. She is one of the main characters in the story, and even at such a young age, she was able to hold her own against more experienced actors. ""A Different Kind of Christmas"" features the funny and enjoyable Shelley Long, and is a wonderful film.

4698688,4,B005GYXNIG,These two videos were not what I expected. They were better. The video descriptions were not written well because of lack of space to tell about the videos I am assuming. If You Believe was kind of like the movie The Kid which was kind of fun because the lady was quite uptight at first and then learned to handle things better and learned to enjoy life. A Different Kind of Christmas was interesting as a single mother of one tries to run for mayor but her father shows up back in her life making it difficult to run successfully. The ending was expected but the plot in between was not what was expected. Enjoy these videos!,1327276800,,626,4.358974358974359

4698691,3,B005GYXNIG,"""If You Believe,"" starring a very young Hayden Panetierre in dual roles, is an entertaining little picture, although not really a Christmas movie so much (parts of it are set during the Christmas season but labeling it a Christmas movie is a stretch). It has a very rushed ending but other than that is very watchable made-for-TV fare.

""A Different Kind of Christmas,"" with Shelley Long as a ladder-climbing attorney, feels even less Christmas-y and is at points pretty depressing and mean-spirited.

8472442,5,B005GYXNIG,"Surprisingly good.  Thought it would be another Hallmark style romance but it turned out to be well done character analysis and a warm romance.  Great acting.  Ally Walker is fabulous and Hayden Panettiere is an incredible child actor in this early movie for her. Tom Amandes is the perfect choice for the male lead.

Good acting and an engrossing romance all in the context of internal struggles for a woman caught in the true to life hysterical career in a publishing house!",1464393600,,476,4.7682926829268295
