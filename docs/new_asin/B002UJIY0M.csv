3991247,3,B002UJIY0M,"So when I first saw the trailer for this, I thought it would be a good solid if not stereotypical movie of a dancers redemption but it was anything but. Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining, just not on in the way it was supposed to be. It starts off really fast with the dancer, Angel, getting stabbed by her ex-boyfriend. No explanation is given, she just automatically moves to California to live with her grandmother. After that it just gets weird. Her mother looks only like 5 years older than her, her grandmother is questionable, and everything just happens in such a whirlwind you are not really sure what you watch by the end. I say if you have a boring sunday afternoon this movie is for you or if you just want something to laugh at with your friends go ahead! Maybe if more people keep watching it, it'll make cult status.",1322524800,2,837,4.406451612903226
3991248,4,B002UJIY0M,"This movie feels as if all the B-Boys/Girls that are cast as extras in those cheeseball hollywood ""Dance"" movies, got fed up and decided to make their own movie.

Its not perfect, for one I feel the choice of the main female lead could have been better, (don't get me wrong, she is a fine dancer as well as a capable actress). I just feels it allows the movie to inadvertedly fall into the ""stereotipical white girl dancer that hangs out with all the latino and black guys..."" movie cliche thing.
I'm also willing to bet the lack of Hollywood glam and teen anghst has to do with the low rating it has received.

Besides that, the movie is Pretty good with beleiveable characters and situations (well, withing the context of the subject matter). The movie features a good number of real B-boys as real people, not simply ""characterless other member of a crew the lead is trying to join"" The Dancing is great, thought as always there could always have been more.

I suppose this movie never had a chance what with the numerous Hammed up hollywood numbers before it.
B-girls are few in number compared to their male counterparts and finding a lead that could dance as well as act was a chalenge i'm sure.

For fans of the 80's breaker movies, this movie is what Beatstreet was to Breaking...lol",1317600000,,1291,4.551724137931035
3991249,5,B002UJIY0M,I Love This Movie it has Beat Freaks Lady Jules in here and man she can break i love her and the Beat Freaks,1310860800,,108,3.5416666666666665
3991250,1,B002UJIY0M,"The biggest mistake for this movie was using Jules Urich to portray a high school breakdancing phenom.

I know it is typical that Hollywood uses twenty-something actors to portray high school kids, but seriously, Jules looks thirty-something and no amount of makeup is going to change that! Her dancing at times was awkward (not her fault) and if she was attempting to have a NYC accent it was hard to tell.

No doubt there are definite limitations making a plot line on a movie based on breakdancing. Jules Urich is talented, but misplaced (age wise) for the storyline in this movie.

There were some really good breakdancers in this movie, but it feels as if they had to be toned down at times to allow Jules to come off as prime. Also the amount of dancing was few and far between.

My suggestion to those who want to make a breakdancing movie, take a chance on finding a real teenage (14-18 something) breakdancing phenom that can act. As for Jules, she can dance and act, there must be some action packed movie she would fit in if given the right director (to direct her).",1305936000,6,1077,4.536082474226804

8381266,1,B002UJIY0M,I was really upset with the quality of the video not the video itself. I could not hear a word even when the volume was on full. it cracked and I could not enjoy it at all. I would like a refund because I could only watch it 5 minutes into the movie. It was really disappointing.,1364256000,,279,3.912280701754386
