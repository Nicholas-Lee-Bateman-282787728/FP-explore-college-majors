8639766,2,B00I86UJDG,"I realize these are amateur productions, so I can forgive the uneveness of the performances.  The only other Madison G&S plays were The Mikado and Utopia Limited.  I love Iolanthe, but it is not an easy one to do, so the quality is rather mixed. I'm giving it two stars because the best thing is the lovely artwork on the cover of the disk.  Iolanthe is beautiful, and the fairy Lord Chancellor is really wonderful.",1515801600,,415,4.506666666666667
8639767,1,B00I86UJDG,The sound is terrible. You just can't understand the dialog or lyrics.  If it had subtitles it would get three stars.,1467849600,2,117,4.571428571428571
8639768,1,B00I86UJDG,"Amateur productions should be labeled as such, or, better still not offered. This production is badly sung, badly cast, and badly directed, with a tiny chorus. It lacks movement, energy, and creativity. It is the sort of local production you attend because you're related to a performer or need an indoor activity for children.",1431043200,,327,5.074074074074074
8639769,5,B00I86UJDG,"What an exquisite production of this charming G&S operetta!
While it is clear that this show was cast with local talent, very few disappoint! Strong performances include Adam Shelton in the role of Strephan, Petter Bissen as the Lord Chancellor,. Both have very good voices and excellent comedic timing. The female chorus was quite strong in this show, greatly outnumbering the men. Their diction was good and they definitely were all connected to their characters which is refreshing to see. Other leads played their parts well with strong singing. All in all, a very entertaining, funny show, with beautiful sets and costumes, good acting and great singing!",1420416000,2,659,5.168224299065421
8639770,1,B00I86UJDG,"I've been buying/watching/reviewing the DVDs from this company for a while.  I was really charmed by the G&S ""Patience"" a while back, and bowled over by the ""Pirates of Penzance"" two years ago.  The other productions have been largely disappointing (some nice stuff in the ""Utopia"")just the kind of G&S you would expect in a small town conuumunity theater.  Last year's ""Pirates"" was fantastic, the treatment of Gilbert's text, the leads, the chours the fantastic diction overall, the clean lines of the direction; great costumes as well.  It seems as though this company has gone back to it's ""let's put on a show in my grandpa's barn"" mentality and it shows throughout the production.  Iolanthe, although not one of the Big 3, is charming little show with lots of potential. Gilbert plays well with the mystery, the mystique and the grace and poise of the imaginary beings (fairies) around which the plot centers.  This production makes the fairies into a herd of women who run around around without purpose, laughing hysterically and crippling any sort of ""fairy tale"" feeling. The leads are serviceable; there are no standouts, as in past years.  The lead soprano was young, very young, and it showed.  The ""lords"" wereall dressed identically, defeating the idea that they are supposedly from all over the British Empire.  NOthing sets the Bartone and Tenor leads apart for the other ""lords,"" in costume or in stage action. The men's chorus from Act One was distracting, with the men bowing and playing pretend percussion instruments; also the men were too few and too weak to pull off that fantastic (long) chorus.  The ""strephon"" charactter (a tenor instead of the usual baritone) was very well sung, but his acting was absurd, harkening back to the ""Monty-Pythonesque"" treatment of past shows.  The female roles were all too low for the ladies cast, although they did try valiantly. Diction was almost completely absent and the laci of coordination between the pit and the stage was, at best, distracting.  The gentleman performing the role of Private Willis had a fine bass voice, although I did not care for the interpretation of his solo song.  The gem, the show-saver (if it could be saved) was the ""love Unrequited"" aria (Lord Chancellor) of Act Two. This was a perfromer, he not only sang very well, but his comic timing was brilliant and the tongue twisting texte delivered flawlessly.  In my review for ""Pirates"" I commented that I hoped the artistic team from that show would be re-assembled for years to come, but there was no one remaining from that show.  A pity.",1399852800,7,2582,4.903448275862069
