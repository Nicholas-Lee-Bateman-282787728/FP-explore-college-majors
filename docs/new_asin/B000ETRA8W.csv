2533674,5,B000ETRA8W,"Don't despair about those school children not jumping on board of the Evolution process.  I was one of those children in my younger days where everything is nice, sugar and spice and puppy dog tails. Well something like that, until I met my high school principal (that had a major in music and literature) later in life, we started to discuss everything from music, literature, governments, religion and science plus local issues. So one day I was going to impress him with my knowledge of bible about creation.  So, I went through the 7-day creation bit with him and he started to ask questions. By the time he got done with me trying to get answers like where did Mrs. Cain come from and where was the light coming on the first day when the Sun was created on the 4th day, he dropped a statement on me that I will never forget.  He said, Hey, when you read a book, you read with an open and inquisitive mind.  If it make sense to you then you can say Okay, this make sense and could possibly be true, however if it doesn't make sense, then you challenge it with own thoughts.  I said"" what if I'm wrong!""  He came back with, ""right or wrong is not the issue, thinking is the issue.""  There was no bright light like they have in religion, but a dimmer light was triggered in my mind and through the years it got brighter and eventually in time I realized that in my early years what my parents exposed me to was not entirely correct. To overcome those young minds in a day trip may not be practical, however, what you may have done is put a dim light in some of these students minds that may enlighten to a brighter ones in the future.

Debating between Religion and Science is a fruitless debate.  Why do I say that, because, there are in two different frame of references and go by different rules.  Religion frame of reference and rules are beliefs, faith and spiritual, while Science frame of reference and rules are analysis, observation and materialistic.  There are good debates and bad debate's, this debate is differently a bad one.  A good debate is where the opponents are in the same frame of reference and rules, have common interests, are in the same fields of interest and debate technical issues only in their fields of expertise.

Those that state that Evolution is a religion will also have to include the Theory of Relativity, Atomic Theory, Germ Theory, Molecular Theory, Plate Tectonics Theory and any Theory that I might have missed. Hey, we just eliminated Science in public schools all together and these Theories can only be taught in a bible class.  I'm begging the scientists, please don't let that happen, I don't want to get brain washed again.  Kidding aside, Evolution can easily be defended in court as a scientific concept and not a religious one.  It was conceived by facts, evidence, observation, analysis, and good old thinking and besides it's not in any scripture.

Transitional forms, the doubters are always asking, "" show me the transitional forms.""  Well, I think the next question Dr. Dawkins should ask is ""What are looking for"" Free swimming worm with a notochord; Fish with flat heads and fins like feet; Reptiles with feathers; Reptiles with mammal like teeth and fir; In mankind is a series of transitional forms with bipedal walking Australopithecus series of Apes to Homo series of Apes including mankind.  I believe the scientists got most of them for the vertebrates.  If these transitional forms are not convincing, then if evolution took place right in front of their eyes would still not convince them.  Hum, I wonder if the mural of transitional forms at Dover was too convincing, so they had to be burned to make them less convincing.  Beware, those that burn murals will eventually burn books.

There is one issue that I disagree with Dr. Dawkins, which he states Evolution is a fact.  Facts are undeniable, not disputable, unchangeable, and repeatable and so on.  Evolution is very convincing and I think it is the most complete scientific concept to date. But, Newton's Laws were also convincing and you know what happen to them by Einstein Theories. Quoting other sources:  (A good Theory will describe a wide range of phenomena based on the most workable philosophy of science with the usage of a few postulates that can be tested and make predictions.  If the Theory passes the tests and if predication's agree with observations, the Theory survives, though it can never be proven correct) I would like to keep it a theory, so scientists, (not fundamentalists christens) can fine tune it and fill in any unexplained phenomena that it may have.

Of course Evolution has no goals, it's a natural process.  A natural process has no intelligence and needs none to operate.  Is somebody telling gravity what to do?  It takes intelligence to set goals and to strive for them.  Also, ""Why"" is not appropriate for a natural process, because it takes intelligence to ask ""Why"" and it also takes intelligence to answer ""Why.""  Evolution can only solve immediate problems and is not goal oriented.

I believe you scientists have a winner, please fight for it, so we don't go back to another Dark Age.",1345420800,2,5153,4.695216907675195

2533676,4,B000ETRA8W,"It's quite unfortunate that RD gave little or no reference to two other greats in this arena: Alfred Russel Wallace and, no less than the father of genetics, Gregor Mendel.  It could be because the former was a co-competitor to Darwin while the latter just happened to be an Augustinian monk. Not that this lends credence to a ""divine"" creation, a very murky concept.  It's seems a wonder of sorts that this ""grand view"" of life sprouted from a mind nurtured in a Judeo-Christian culture; didn't happen in an Islam, atheist, Hindu, or any other social setting. Darwin, Wallace and Mendel are the progenitors of this young discipline of evolution and genetics.  One only needs to walk inside some of the hallways of leading biotech companies, or maybe academia, to see that labs and conference rooms are named after these giants.
The interviews in Part II were exasperating:  Prof. Dennett merely waxed poetic about Darwin with nary a doubt from RD; whereas the two doubters Wright and Mackay were from another time zone altogether; however, the interview with the physician, R. Neese, was enjoyable and informative.",1278460800,5,1115,4.978494623655914

""This series is about perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to the human mind.  The idea is evolution by natural selection and the genius who thought of it was Charles Darwin [1809 to 1882].  I'm a biologist and Darwin has been an inspiration to me throughout my whole career.

His masterpiece, ""On the Origin of Species"" was published 150 years ago [in 1859] and it changed forever our view of the world and our place in it.  What Darwin achieved was nothing less than a complete explanation of the complexity and diversity of all life.  And yet it's one of the simplest ideas that anyone ever had.

In this series, I'm going to set out Darwin's big idea, I'll explain how the human species has struggled with the story of its own origins, and take you into the storm that is today's backlash against Darwin.""

The above is what the narrator, Richard Dawkins, says in the introduction to this three-episode series.  Dawkins is an ethologist, evolutionary biologist, popular science author, and formerly professor for Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University.

It is important to remember that this is a science presentation.  It is NOT a documentary that presents the science VS religion debate.

This is a good primer on the man and the big idea that changed the way we think of the natural world and ourselves.  The program goes further by looking at the implications of Darwin's work in the contemporary world.

It also addresses the continuing controversy surrounding Darwin's ideas and while it may seem to be a one-sided presentation, it's grounded in science rather than politics.  (For me, after I saw this documentary, I wanted to read Darwin's 1859 masterpiece again!)

Three things stood out for me after I viewed this documentary:

(1) Darwin's ideas are explained quite well.

(2) Richard Dawkins' personal comments on Darwinian principles.  For example (and I agree), he thinks ""survival of the fittest"" is an abhorrent way for human society to function.

(3) The e-mails Dawkins received after the publication of his bestselling book ""The God Delusion"" (2006).  The comments (he reads some of them) he received were just horrible.

There is a second bonus disc included as well.  It consists of six uncut interviews with a philosopher, a doctor/author, the head of the ""Concerned Women for America"" (CWA), the archbishop of Canterbury, a creationist, and science teachers.  All interviews are informative, amusing, and can be exasperating.  (I must confess that I almost pulled some of my hair out when listening to the interviews with the head of the CWA and the creationist.)

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2009) is flawless in picture and audio quality.  The main disc has 3 informative extras.

In conclusion, Richard Dawkins does a superb job in this presentation of Charles Darwin's ideas.  See for yourself why this show won the BBC's ""Best Documentary Series"" award!!

2533678,1,B000ETRA8W,"I'm open minded when it comes to the natural selection versus religion debate. Unfortunately, however, this film did not present both sides of the argument. I think it is important to weigh both pros and cons of any debate to be truly educated about your beliefs but this film was not able to do that. I was hoping for something more intuitive.",1272585600,5,344,4.564516129032258

of evolution. It is a bit light on the science but this is expected since Mr. Dawkins
is also focusing on how evolution affects our society, vis-a-vis politics. Still there is good science presented and a lot of neat evidence for evolution. If you really want more details on evidence for evolution I would stongly recommend his book 'The Greatest Show on Earth'. Even better, if you commute often, try the audio CD in which he is co-narrator.
I am devouring the book after listening to the CD. Amazing stuff!",1268611200,4,595,4.6761904761904765

2533681,5,B000ETRA8W,"This is an excellent BBC documentary by one of our best scholars on evolution. Richard Dawkins gives an excellent defense of Darwin and evolution. His interview with Wendy Wright shows the shallowness of the Intelligent Design proponents, who want to throw the best supported theory in science into the trash can because it conflicts with the views of ignorant prophets who wandered around in the desert thousands of years ago.
Dawkins is an atheist, which I believe is the correct position, but an atheist is in a difficult situation. It is often argued that atheists believe in nothing. I believe a good balance to this position is to argue with Joseph Campbell the value of religion as myth, not as revealed truth as the Intelligent Design people do. This is an improper use of religion. A study of comparative religions shows that they all have similar myths which give spiritual support to their believers. I don't feel this sense of awe in church, but I do feel it when I'm hiking in the mountains.
I'm sending a copy of Campbell's Mythos I DVD to my grandchildren along with this one. It shouldn't be Science Vs. Spirituality. We need both.",1257984000,30,1147,4.768844221105527
2533682,5,B000ETRA8W,"I purchased this title from Richard Dawkins' website some time ago and have enjoyed watching it many times.  The Athena programs are great educational experiences, and some are dated.  This particular series aired in 2008, and is an excellent addition to the Athena catalogue. The extensive supplements may not quite equal those seen on RDF's separately available unedited interviews 3-disc set, but I am sure will feature the best material.

Here's hoping that Athena will pick up other Dawkins series, such as ""The Root Of All Evil,"" and ""The Enemies Of Reason,"" although I suspect that they'd be considered too controversial.  Still, they are widely available elsewhere.",1256860800,25,673,5.261682242990654
2533683,4,B000ETRA8W,"Not long ago I read that a group of American tourists was being shown around Westminster Abbey in London. When the guide pointed out the grave of Charles Darwin, one of the Americans actually walked over and spat on it.

While the perpetrator may not have been the first reviewer of this DVD (below), they are certainly spiritual kin. If you believe that the world was created - in seven days - in 4004 BC, and that Adam and Eve were surrounded by romping dinosaurs, you won't like this film. Equally, if you judge the greatest scientific discoveries by your perhaps biased estimate of the scientist's moral caliber, you may also be disinclined to purchase it.

If, however, you possess a mind that is open to new concepts - or simply want to learn more about a great man who is regarded by the majority of scientists as a major contributor to the sum of human knowledge - you will be interested in this well put together collection of expert opinions, accurate biography, and archival photography.",1251849600,13,998,4.6647727272727275
8114129,5,B000ETRA8W,"This is an excellent buy. Dawkins is always great and presents the genius of Charles Darwin's discoveries very elegantly. He covers the push back from creationists and presents evidence for the facts of evolution far beyond what Darwin had imagined. This film also covers the moments of anguish, as well as excitement, Darwin felt after the verification of his theory and the effects that had on his life.",1492473600,2,405,4.970588235294118
8114130,4,B000ETRA8W,"Richard Dawkin's passion about evolution is contagious and he does have an ability to teach.  I would urge everyone to watch this; it is well worth watching.  Informative and personal -- one feels very close to Dawkins and appreciates his excitement. But be it certainly known: his main point in this series and elsewhere is to attack religion -- any belief in God or nonmaterial reality whatsoever that hints of something more....

His attacks are not fatal as he would wish but he presents believers in the worse light simply because he finds them so unbelievable!.  He attacks and scorns liberal, more intellectual believers equally with conservative believers.  Dr. Rowan Williams, archbishop of Canterbury, is probably eager to embrace and integrate evolutionary awareness into a larger faith picture.  But that would be intolerable to Dawkins.

Dawkins not only chooses unbelief for himself, he wants to force unbelief on EVERYONE. I am not exaggerating. Christianity is not acceptable and must fall.  The Bible in the face of science cannot be believed ---as Dawkins sees it.  It's time for liberals to choose science or religion, and to join him in mocking common religious folk out of the public sphere.

The truth of such a grand idea will not win out on it's own. This is really the message underlying the ""The Genius of Charles Darwin.""  Right is right and wrong is wrong. The grand fact of evolution has not been grand enough to kill off faith in God and so Dawkins is pouring his life into forcing the dreadful (yet exciting) reality of it on us all.  You have to give him credit and appreciate all his commitment and effort: it is not easy for most of us to see what he sees.  He's kind of a driven prophet of unbelief crying out in the streets here.

Dawkins does seem to be acting out a cruel kind of survival of the fittest mentality in his own struggle against religion.  And to survive and thrive the best response is to take on his challenge and read and learn everything you can about evolution and science. It is all fascinating. I feel my faith will probably change; I will certainly continue to read the Bible and understand it, and life itself, in a new light as I continue to study evolutionary science and other sciences -- at the same time.

But no --  I know evolution will not -- counter to what Dawkins says over and over -- evolution will not explain EVERYTHING.  So don't feel afraid to watch and enjoy this series.  It is a well thought out and a moving unbeliever's testimonial.  And Dawkins can be respected and even loved for it and his other work.  And his belief in evolution through natural selection does get through much more clearly than any other presentation I've seen.  Evolution is moving and meaningful and exciting and, to me at least, God-like.

Nevertheless...He's highly intolerant. I'm not one for post-modernism as a central value system, but certainly as a way to get along and to persuade others (rather than demand acquiescence), it is a huge advance over Dawkin's approach. It's hard to even talk with someone for whom all religious words are despicable!  Having read a few biographies on Darwin, I'm not sure Darwin would approve of his methods.  A major flaw, but apparently you can't get Dawkins strengths without his weaknesses so I have to give it a solid 4 stars.",1464825600,,3328,4.726169844020797

I've ever seen UFO by my eyes 3 times last year, 2013, (all appeared in the sky. Other people in the area watched it also. I've 2 eye witnesses on the 2nd watched) but I also do believe God existence as I find God's wonderful creation in me & other creations too. How wonderful is my mind & body work. From the lower cast (viruses) - highest (human/ alien) until the mighty universe (galaxies, quasars, dark matter, BLACK HOLES, etc) nothing is created by chance/ coincidentally. Even until subatomic particles bcs scientists found regularities & they can formulate it (nuclear energy, particle elementary science). I can understand some scientists anti/ battle against religion and vise versa bcs they see each other in different angle.

Scientists see anything based on 100% evidence & logic way of thinking while religion(s) is made for human moral guidance only bcs in the past/ ancient time human were still wild/ sadistic. Sometimes religion could explain something but admits miracles. It also admits God(s) who created this life/ Someone who is(are) higher thn us while Budha doesn't believe in God but in reincarnation. Hwvr, correct/ true religion is teaching us about moral/ do good things for humanity. So scientists & religion they see something at different angle bcs they both are created/ exist for a specific job.

Science without religion is like human can understand how material works/ created until subatomic level (elementary particles) but they don't believe tht stones form SOS sign in a desert means someone is in danger. They thought those are created naturally. While religion without science is like our world was created only around 6,000 yrs ago (bible says 1 day on earth is 1,000 yrs in heaven) but many geological evidences indicating/ prove much much older (some billion yrs).

I do believe in evolution/ diversity  theories bcs God commanded to multiply/ full fill earth in the early creation. All creations from viruses-human are equipped wth adaptive capabilities to changing / hostile envinroments. Elvis/ M Jackson could soon be forgotten after several generations but all creations, especially human being, are the legend. It's not a simple task to keep exist & even becomes more versatile/ intelligence  frm a very simple life form in the early creation until now. Some billions yrs already and all creatures are still keep adapting themselves for new environments (eg. climate change).  So both should fulfil each other.",1389052800,,2620,5.226190476190476
