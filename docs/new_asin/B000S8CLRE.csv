8204733,2,B000S8CLRE,"I cannot follow the book - I am looking for a simple ""send"" or forward whick eludes me  - how to ""save"" pages - favorites are too confusing for me.  The book is really too complicated for me.  I have been on heavy pain meds for years which probably killed some brain cells - I cannot find or follow through simple things with this book.  Before this I had MSNTV2 - it took foreever but was so easy for me to work.  I am stuck with a book I cannot understand.  Thank you.",1201132800,4,470,4.0
