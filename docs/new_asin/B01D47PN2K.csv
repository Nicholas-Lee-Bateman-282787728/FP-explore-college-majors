I'm a long-time avid Carter Family fan (since 1962 when I was 12 years old and heard them sing for the first time).

7697003,5,B01D47PN2K,"For those of us who are interested in the history of country music, this video is a must for us to see and enjoy.  The Carter Family were and continue to be an integral part in the development of country music and music in general.  I was fortunate to be able to see Johnny Cash and his extended troupe of great musicians perform when they appeared at the Civic Center in downtown San Diego many years ago.  That nigh,t I was able to see Johnny Cash on stage along with June, Helen, and Anita of the Carter Family, along with Carl Perkins and the Statler Brothers and Tommy Cash.  Unfortunately Mother Mabel was not feeling well at that time and was not on stage with them.  In the audience were many members of the Carter and Cash family such as Johnny Cash's father and daughter, and June Carter's daughters and other family relatives.  They all came to San Diego to see Johnny and his troupe perform. I have seen a lot of great rock, blues, classical, and country artists perform over the years, but getting to see the Carter Family in person was probably the best concert experience that I ever have had.  In this video and in the book with the same title, I  learned that Chester Atkins (later Chet Atkins) got his start with the Carter Family and they helped him be accepted by other country musicians who had previously had been willing to accept him style of playing as being ""country"".  Apparently, in his earlier days he had developed his style of playing by watching and listening to Mother Mabel.  I am a professional musician myself and after watching this, I began to realized that  lot of things that I was learning to do in the l960's had been developed many years earlier by Mother Mabel where she where she would be playing the lead line on the lower strings of the guitar while playing the chords on the upper strings of the guitar at the same time as can be seen and heard in her performance on ""Wildwood Flower"" and so many other Carter Family recordings.  I can see why Johnny Cash became interested in June Carter when he first heard the Carter Family sisters perform on the ""Border"" radio station.  June may have not been the most gifted musically of the Carter Sisters, but she was certainly the most outgoing of the sisters and most entertaining.  My favorite Carter sister though was Anita Carter who was more shy then June and was content to be more in the background.  Anita Carter probably had one of the best voices in country music or in popular music and it is too bad that she did not produce more tracks as a solo artists.  When I saw the Carter family perform, Anita performed the lead vocals on one of the songs.  As I mentioned I have had the chance of see a lot of great artists, but hearing Anita sing was probably the best vocal performance that I have ever had an opportunity to listen to.

I would give this video 10 stars if that was possible!!!

This video is one that you will want to watch over and over again.",1468540800,7,2957,4.412523020257827

7697010,5,B01D47PN2K,"'The Winding Stream explains how the 'Carter family' just keeps adding while growing as it curves around to involve and envelop their entire family. From the very original family of A.P. (Alvin Pleasant), Sara, and Maybelle Carter down through their children also including grandchildren, cousins, husbands, and wives; The Carter Family just continues to expand like a widening winding stream at all times.

The quite extreme authenticity of 'First Family of Country Music' begins in Maces Springs, Virginia deep in the Appalachian Mountains. Daughter of Johnny Cash, Miss Roseanne Cash, explains that many musicians (featured within) talk about how the ultimate grounding sound came from the unique sound of the Carter family's music. Even her father, the amazing Johnny Cashs music can be traced back to the primal and rooted sounds heard as a child himself. The grounded country sound of the Carter family he followed through a whole career.

The original Carter Family revolutionized Traditional Regional music, Folk music, Roots music, Bluegrass, Traditional Appalachian music, Americana and, of course, Country music, and brought each to these to the limelight. A.P married Sara and cousin Maybelle married A.P.s brother, Ezra which soon split (Mama) Maybelle along with her daughters, including June Carter, who consequently went on to marry Johnny Cash who blended even more to the original sound through their children's vocal talents. The stream keeps winding and widening to inclusively, generation after generation never forget to ever remember their sound is grounded their heritage's astounding type of traditional 'roots-based music'.

Johnny and June's son, John Carter Cash, chats here about his mothers effervescent comedy and elaborate songs including the autoharp and the important placement in the line-up of the family which she plays. Maybelle and Sara Junes are the famous sister's as they progressed on their own. Roseanne Cash (""Tennessee Flattop Box"") weighs in on the newer sound still being primal, rooted and quite direct"" even still. Her influential commentary, including a great amount of archival footage, makes the story of this exquisite and original family wonderful as many musicians have their say of why the familys music lent so much to different, but also, original genres of music.

This documentary is filled with music, explanation, much familial love and how their sound spread like wildfire throughout the country and it is still as relevant today. Deeply-rooted in Gospel first, then a simpler but also more of a complicated structure, the ""Carter family"" is lauded for their unmatched contribution to great American music; the first and undisputed family of many different genres of engaging original music.",1466553600,8,2755,5.444964871194379
