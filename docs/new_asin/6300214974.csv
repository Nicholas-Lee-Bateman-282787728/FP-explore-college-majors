262049,3,6300214974,"I remember enjoying watching this on the Wonderful World of Disney as a child.  A ""boy meets dog, loses grandfather, finds new family"" formula film. A couple of sad/scary moments, nicely smoothed over by the sudden appearance of a parent/adult to explain things.

A pleasant, if bland depiction of Flanders in 1900. Worth watching to see scenes of Antwerp in 1959 where it was filmed.

Out of print I believe, but I found it in a bargain bin at ""X""mart.",1087689600,7,453,4.6375

Then at my library I found this older edition and was so pleased when I found it still in print and available ....  The older edition is different abit from the newer version; however I love both stories.
It is a classic of the highest standards.  The original book has a sad ending and I am glad the movies are more joyful!
Excellent movies for children to see, especially any children with artistic talent!  Enjoy!",1000339200,9,504,4.376344086021505

But I'm still no fan of Rubens -- I'll take Rembrandt.

262138,5,6300214974,"I first saw ""A Dog Of Flanders"" as a kid, maybe 40 years ago. I remember it was a sweet and sometimes sad story that I liked very much, but the details had grown vague with all the years. Recently, I heard about a film remake of the same name (and I presume, story), on cable. I haven't watched it and I probably won't. Remakes are almost always inferior to the originals and often disappoint.

Seeing this copy here at Amazon, I bought it on a nostalgic whim. Something to add to my collection of old-time favorites. I'm glad I did, as it's even better than I had remembered. I think that this is one of those films that should be in every house with a kid under the roof. A beautiful little classic.

Oh, the picture quality was perfectly fine, if a bit dated, and I had no issues with the sound.",1317600000,,798,4.209150326797386
262139,5,6300214974,"This is a movie set in Northern Belgium, highlighting the city of Antwerp. It's about a boy's love for his dog, and learning responsibility. The boy's grandfather gives him many lessons in life which he will definitely use for the future. If you're an older person, you may remember the way most of our parents taught us responsibility, and how hard work pays off. The gentle boy also teaches us that love, caring, and giving comes back to us double. The countryside setting, as well as Antwerp is absolutely beautiful. The story never has a dull moment. The actors are wonderful, and overall still one of my favorite movies of all time. Please, if you purchase a version of this movie, make sure it's the original.",1312416000,3,715,4.682539682539683
262140,5,6300214974,"""A Dog of Flanders""  is family entertainment at its very best and will delight all ages.

Made in 1959, it showcases the rare talent of the three leading players - David Ladd is
Nello, a young Dutch boy who's ambition is to become an artist, Donald Crisp is his
wise grandfather who is dedicated to raising the boy and Theodore Bikel in perhaps his
finest role is an artist of considerable talent who befriends Nello and inspires him
to pursue his dream. Donald Crisp and Theodore Bikel have good character roles.

Based on a story by Ouida and beautifully filmed on location in Belgium and the
Netherlands, it tells the story of Nello and his grandfather who live in abject
poverty in a small rented house on the great Flanders Plain and who barely exist
on the money they earn transporting milk for sale in their dog drawn cart to
Antwerp.

Their dog is an animal that they found by the roadside and which had been cruelly
beaten and ditched by its previous owner.  Nello nurses the dog back to health
and they become good friends.

Life is a daily struggle which only gets worse when Nello's grandfather dies and he is
tossed out of the house by his cruel landlord when he can no longer pay the rent.
Only his passion to become an artist and his close association with his artist friend
save him from disaster. The story is told in a straightforward and winning manner.

The movie has been digitally restored and re-mastered to a pristine condition, in
fact I believe that it looks and sounds better now than it did on its initial
theatrical release.

Highly recommended.",1272153600,3,1574,4.576512455516014

I was about 8 or 9 years old when I first saw it and seeing, probably for the first time, real art, artists and works of the great masters resulted in life long love of art and its creation. Fifty years later I love art even more and love this fine little film.",1266105600,3,382,3.9740259740259742

I rented this movie on netflixs and decided it was a must have. Its about a orphaned boy named Nello, who lives with aging grandfather. They seem to be barely making ends meet. They don't even have enough to eat. One day they are coming home from a very long day selling milk, and fine this old abused and neglected dog, against this grandfathers better judgement they take the dog in knowing that it will make a even bigger hardship on the struggling family.  Nello takes a very strong liking to the dog and names it Patrasche, but soon things get worst, Grandfather gets sick and Nello and Patrasche take over the Milk deliveries. After a while Grandfather dies, and leaves Nello Struggling he looses his milk delivery job...

This movie is about having dreams. About having friends and about being loved even when you think their is no one left to be loved by.",1262736000,2,885,4.660256410256411
262173,5,6300214974,"I went to see A Dog of Flanders in 1961, when I was fourteen, and it became one of my all time favourite films. This is a superb tear-jerker, filmed on location in Holland and Belgium in 1959, but set in 1900. It stars the then twelve-year-old David Ladd as the orphan Nello and veteran actor Donald Crisp as his elderly and infirm grandfather. Although devoted to one another, they live a very poor life selling milk from a hand cart they pull around Antwerp. Nello is an artistic, intelligent and sensitive little boy who wants to paint like his idol, Peter Paul Rubens, but he has no money to enable him to study or to buy proper materials to paint with. They find a badly treated dog, left to die at the roadside by his heartless owner and take him home and care for him. Because he's been so badly treated, it takes time for him to accept them as his friends. But eventually, they gain his trust. Nello names him Patrasche...the name that Rubens had given to his dog...and he becomes part of the small family, even pulling the cart when grandfather is unable to do so any more. One day, Nello has just finished a sketch of the old man dozing in a chair outside their one-roomed hut and goes to show him the finished drawing. But he cannot awaken him and slowly, he comes to realise that his beloved grandfather is dead. Completely bereft and unable to keep up the rent on their home, Nello and Patrasche are evicted by an uncaring landlord in the middle of winter and just before Christmas. Somehow, they have to learn how to survive without his grandfather in a harsh and bitter world.

A Dog of Flanders, from the 1872 novel by Ouida, had been filmed previously, notably in 1934, but never so well as this. Even though the very tragic ending of the novel is changed to a happy ending here, it really is beautifully done all round and everyone connected with it should feel very proud of the result. The picturesque landscapes of Flanders are superbly captured on film in CinemaScope and Color by De Luxe by Otto Heller and the music score by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter is very haunting. David Ladd, who had previously given such a truly wonderful performance alongside his father Alan in The Proud Rebel (1958), is superb. David and I shared the same Christian name, were both the same age and had similar looks, which made it easy for me to identify with him in A Dog of Flanders. Theodore Bikel has a good character role in it as an artist who befriends Nello, eventually adopts him and helps him to realise his dreams.

This is a wonderful film and you really would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by it. I give it ten out of ten. This E1 Entertainment re-mastered and restored 2009 DVD release of this classic 1959 film is a joy to behold. Having had to put up for years with the truncated pan and scan video and DVD of this film, the new DVD restores it to its original 2.35:1 CinemaScope and Color by De Luxe glory, complete with the original ""Twentieth Century-Fox presents a CinemaScope picture"" opening trade mark, previously removed from the Paramount and other DVD companies pan and scan videos and DVD's. It seems that 20th Century-Fox have somehow lost the rights to their own film here, but don't be put off by the fact that this new DVD release isn't released by Fox. The quality is as good as anything released in their own Studio Classics series. The DVD is also anamorphically enhanced for 16 x 9 monitors and televisions. Highly recommended, even though the sound on the DVD is in mono and not in the original stereo of the film as first released.",1258156800,7,3590,4.462709284627093
262174,5,6300214974,"I had the old Paramount VHS version of this great classic 1959 film, but it was pan-and-scan with a rather washed-out picture.  The first DVD version was an improvement but still utilized the pan-and-scan full screen treatment.  However this new DVD blows both out of the water ! The film looks brand new and includes the Fox trade-mark logo.  How wonderful to finally view this heart-warming story in the original wide-screen format...there's just no comparison.  Full marks to the producers of this re-issue !  But make sure you get the blue case (wide-screen) and NOT the purple case (pan-and-scan).

262175,4,6300214974,"A Dog of Flanders is a compelling movie especially for those people who love dogs.  This particular version of the film (1960) has several outstanding actors, such as Theodore Bikel, Donald Crisp and David Ladd and is, without doubt, my favorite among the several versions.  The story takes place in Belgium and is based on an old Belgian story about a young boy who wants to become a painter and his loving relationship with a dog he rescues.  The particular Ruben's painting that the young boy, Nello, so desperately wanted to view can actually be seen today in the Cathedral in Antwerp.  It is indeed a beautiful painting.

I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a traditional good family film.  It is beautifully set, sentimental to a point, and an endearing memory to hold.",1232755200,3,796,4.731884057971015
262176,4,6300214974,"It is a well-told story of Nello, a poor boy aspiring to be an artist, and Patrasche, a faithful dog who becomes a friend to him. Based on Ouida's 1872 novella, ""A Dog of Flanders"" is heart-warming family picture, in which good people (and a dog) get what they deserve and bad people get their due. It is also about a friendship between a poor boy and an ill-used dog, which is appealing to us even now.

As is often the case with film adaptations, the original story is considerably changed. The people of the village (near the 19th century Antwerp) are more compassionate to the lonely boy and his grandfather than those counterparts in Ouida's book. The changed conclusion (seen again in the 1999 adaptation, which is slightly more faithful to the original) will be satisfying to most viewers, but still the new ending could have been developed into something more emotional.

The cast (including the dog) is unanimously good and among them Theodore Bikel is memorable as an artist who befriends Nello. The character and his subplot are added in adapting the original, but you may find the love story of this slightly eccentric painter a bit detracting because the film is, and should be, about the boy and the dog after all.

For me the real star of the film is its location. The wonderful landscapes of Netherland and Belgium give the film credibility and so do Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp and its interior with its solemn beauty. Maybe slightly dated, but ""A Dog of Flanders"" is a nice picture you can enjoy with your family.",1223769600,3,1536,4.660516605166052

262179,4,6300214974,"This is an interesting story that consistently presents the optimistic and appealing side of existentialism.  The characters are multi-dimensional and believable, and the story touching but not sappy (except maybe the ending).  The acting and video are typical of 1959 and are a bit jarring now -- but the story makes up for it, in my opinion.

The movie presents a consistent, optimistic existentialist point of view: virtue is having and making choices which shape your own destiny; while un-virtue is having or exercising no control over one's life.  Also, virtue is focusing on the individual human side of people, while un-virtue is treating people legalistically as objects.  As the plot progresses, Nello, though persistent and determined in his pursuit of his dream, finds his choices slipping away until it looks like he has lost everything, even his life.  But in the end, he, the miller, the legalistic priest, and the artist mentor all find existential redemption.

I've also reviewed the 1999 version of this movie, which I really disliked.  I go into more details about the characters and compare the 1959 and 1999 versions point by point.  You may find that review helpful also.",1098489600,6,1193,5.076923076923077
262180,3,6300214974,"This movie would be just another run-of-the-mill movie about an orphan boy and a dog with some serious overacting on the part of Theodore Bikel, among others, but there are parts of this movie that make it worth watching.

Nello, played by David Ladd, the future husband of Cheryl Ladd, lives with his grandfather after his mother passed away.  Nello loves art and paintings and longs to be a painter.  He frequently sneaks into the local cathedral to avoid paying a franc to see original paintings by Peter Paul Rubens.  However, Nello's grandfather is poor and the pair can barely afford to eat, much less purchase paints for Nello.  However, in spite of the little they have the two are happy.

Life changes for Nello when he and his grandfather come upon a dog left to die.  Nello wants to adopt the dog and help it, and his grandfather reluctantly agrees.  The principal difficulty is that there is barely enough food for Nello and his grandfather, and the dog is just that much more burden.  Things continue to degrade for Nello as the miller refuses to allow his daughter to play with Nello after catching Nello drawing her picture.  Then the man who abandoned the dog tries twice to take it back, planning to abuse the dog again.  The second time the man attempts to take the dog back the miller gets involved and the man meets an unfortunate end.  It seems as though life continues to go down hill for Nello.

There is one bright spot in Nello's life.  He has made a kind of friend of a painter in Antwerp who, after yelling and complaining to Nello, has started to help Nello realize his ambition of becoming a painter.  Ultimately the painter helps Nello enter a local painting competition by providing Nello with paper and paints.  Nello's grandfather sold some things and allowed Nello to buy a brush before he died.  Nello's one great hope is that he will win the painting contest, which will allow him to continue to live in his rented hovel.

While you can see where Nello has hope that all will turn out well, there are too many factors working against Nello, and eventually he gives his dog to the Miller's daughter and leaves.  In the meantime, the painter has found the painting that Nello has entered in the contest and wants to talk to him about it, but then he finds that Nello has disappeared.  Where did Nello go?  What will happen to his dog?  Did I mention that Nello wonders why the painter has yet to marry his model, who is obviously in love with him?  I leave these questions for you to answer if you can find a copy of this movie.

Difficult to see from the quality of the movie, but the paintings by Peter Paul Rubens are truly wondrous and appear to be authentic.  Even with the weak video I will still impressed by these magnificent paintings.  The cathedral in which they were housed, which the end credits states is genuine, is gorgeous, a fitting home for the art within.

The quality of this movie may leave a bit to be desired, as the performances vary from wooden to hammy, but the scenery in 1959 Belgium and Holland, especially the cathedral interiors, is beautiful, and the story should appeal to mature children ages 7 and above who can handle the occasional violence.  David Ladd is wonderful as the center of the attention and his perfect blend of enthusiasm and innocence brings to mind Little Orphan Annie.",1098316800,13,3355,4.565217391304348
