Even if you had never seen a teen or a zombie flick, this movie would still be like watching your neighbor's vacation videos.. This film didn't have an original bone in it's body. The script and writing is weak, and I was bored the whole time. I couldn't find one single laugh or scare, and the love fascination with the song ""Shadow of the Night"" was annoying, and the cover is horrid.. this actually was the only real scare in the whole thing.

3540643,4,B001DWFEIW,"A school from hell (filled with teachers who belong in prison), houses the perfect buffet for a pack of zombies fresh from their graves.  No surprise, the students are categorized by type (most look too old to still be in high school).  Far too much time is wasted on the imbalance between these factions.  Things only pick up once the Sci-Fi Club heads for the local graveyard and find an empty coffin.  From that point on, this movie improves immensely.  A veritable zombie army leaves their graves by leaps and bounds.............literally!  Those not at the prom rush to join forces with other survivors.  Unfortunately, they mistakenly take refuge in a funeral home.  These chosen few take it upon themselves to vanquish the horde and save those not eaten.

There's humor aplenty and sometimes it works.  Most of the characters are borderline obnoxious, some are just bland.  The teachers are all played with far too much exaggeration.  It makes it seem as if they are in a loony bin rather than a high school.  But the zombie action is exceptional.  There is that to look forward to.  This one definitely goes into my collection of zombie flicks.",1425254400,,1152,4.8061224489795915

3540645,4,B001DWFEIW,"If the zombie apocalypse happened during your high school prom, wouldn't you help your classmates out?  Well honestly I would have preferred the ZA to going to my senior prom because it was totally boring, but watching this cheesy movie was more enjoyable than my prom was.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

There's really not much story here.  There is a nuclear power plant that is dumping toxic waste into the water supply of the town it powers, and it's causing the dead to rise from the grave as zombies.  The geeks of the school as well as a rockin' garage band, a cheerleader, and the student body vice-president, (Well the president is a zombie so I guess she is now the president), are the only survivors of the ZA and they have to destroy the zombies along with the help of their militant gym teacher.

They head to the school and find out that all the kids and teachers at the prom are already zombies so they want to blow up the school to take out all the zombies.  Our main geek and the vice-president, (The girl he has a crush on), have to go into the swarm of the zombies to retrieve the detonator to the bombs, and the garage band helps out by playing on stage and it actually calms the zombies.  Now that was pretty awesome!  I love heavy metal and these guys actually were playing some decent music!  So we got zombies, an awesome metal band, and a group of sci-fi geeks.  What more could you want in a bad zombie movie?

In the end they manage to get the detonator and escape and in the process they rescue the prom queen and two other girls and manage to spout out a line from Star Wars, (My name is _______ I'm here to rescue you!), and blow up the school and take out the zombies!

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

I was totally expecting a low budget bad zombie movie, but this movie pleasantly surprised me and gave me an actual good movie!  The blood and gore are lame, the special effects are good, the writing is decent, the costumes are good, and the actors are halfway competent.  Put all that together and you've got a zombie movie that you don't mind sitting down and watching for 90 minutes.

3540654,5,B001DWFEIW,"I have watched ""Dance of the Dead"" several times now. The characters, the plot, the pacing and the dialogue keep bringing me back. There's simply no reason to miss this film. What I've seen of the Ghost House Underground offerings has been mostly unimpressive junk, but this is a sparkling gem. Even the extras are a whole lot of fun. Joss Whedon, you have company.

The story: The nuclear power plant is leaking enough to wake the dead. And so they rise up, on the eve of the prom. It takes an oddball ""Scooby gang"" of high school stereotype characters, deliciously well cast, to try to stop them. There's the middle-aged loser gym teacher, the over-caffeinatedly perky class booster, the slacker (who looks like one of The Ramones), the nerdy members of the Sci-Fi Club, the cheerleader, the class-cutting guys who just want to play in a rock band, and oooh, the class bully -- played spectacularly by Justin Welborn, a guy who truly deserves to be seen more often. The bonus short involving his character is worth the price of the dvd, all by itself.

Anyone who's ever attended high school should enjoy this film. Anyone who enjoys a good zombie film will be likewise entertained. Anyone who likes ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Zombieland"" should recognize a close kinship between these films. Anyone who never missed an episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" will sigh with pleasure. And naturally, anyone who watched ""Freaks and Geeks"" or ""My So-Called Life"" and imagined it would be even better, if only it had an undead component -- well, look, just watch this film. It's perfect in every way.",1339459200,,1594,4.750902527075812

3540656,4,B001DWFEIW,"I'm not a fan of horror flicks by any stretch of the imagination due to their 'predictability' in my esteem, however, Dance of the Dead is one of my favorite films.  I bought it on a whim thinking it looked more funny than gory, and was I in for a treat.  The film hinges on the fact that a power plant is making the dead come back to life and the worst of it occurs on the same night of Prom.  A group of the usual suspects (cheerleader, geeks, loner, troublemaker, class president, etc.) must fight the zombies to live.  The characters are pretty realistic for being high school tropes and the one liners zing faster than bullets, but that's what makes the movie fun.  I would have liked to have seen the teacher's fleshed out a little more other than their being the 'bad guys' but otherwise Dance of the Dead was a lot of fun as everyone finds a way to come together and fight the big bad zombies who can actually drive a car and come flying out of their graves as if they are some sort of super zombies.
While it is violent and bloody, it is never over the top gross out or anything like that and the movie benefits from the fact that no one seems to take themselves too seriously.  A seriously fun and funny zombie flick.  Recommend it.",1322438400,,1242,4.237288135593221
3540657,4,B001DWFEIW,"Three and a half stars on the zombie b-movie scale. (Spoilers follow . . . )

This movie ""borrows"" from just about everywhere. The grounds keeper at the cemetery is from ""Cemetery Man"" and isn't surprised when the zombies start exploding out of the ground (a la ""Evil Dead""). The president of the sci-fi club steals dialogue from Luke Skywalker, etc. None of it makes a whole lot of sense, but it's all so much fun that we don't care.

The caretaker at the cemetery knows that the dead are rising as zombies, but so far he's been able to kill them off as quickly as they rise and hey, he can't afford to lose his job; so he hasn't told anyone about it. Our two romantic leads have a fight, break-up, and now the female is going to go to the prom with a jerk. Well, at least she thinks she is. He thinks they are going to park by the cemetery and get some action before the dance . . . this being a zombie movie the rest is inevitable.

She survives and later (with some nerds and a cheerleader) manages to hole-up in a mansion, which turns out to be a funeral home . . . She calls the male protagonist who, with the assistance of the school bully (complete with ""extreme wrestling"" videos on youtube), manages to reunite with her. But wait, all their friends are at the prom which is sure to attract ""all"" of the zombies. (No, why the school dance would attract zombies but not the movie theater or the express way is never really explained, but don't think too much about it, this is a zombie movie.)

By the end we have every teen movie clich imaginable, plus a gun loving football coach, trying to save the day by blowing up the school with the zombies in it. Note: these are not Romero's zombies. They are faster and they . . . have a weakness for rock music. If you want a ""serous"" zombie movie, this isn't it, but if you can park your brain this is a fun little movie.",1322179200,,1874,4.211699164345404
3540658,5,B001DWFEIW,"I love this movie! It's not a big budget, pretentious Resident Hollywood Evil, poorly written and un-thought  out plot and story line piece of crap movie. Nor It is a low / no budget, hardly thought out past the first page, unrealistic dialog delivered by goofing friends who thought it would be fun ""acting"" in a ZOMBIE movie, movie! Dance of the Dead is unpretentious fun with a well thought out and well written script and a great group of actors that have no egos and can really act!
A bunch of high schoolers; the unpopular geeks (but not the really weird ""emo / goth"" kids), save the day by kicking zombie butt.  What is not to love about this movie? Dare I say that I like this zomidy more than I do Shawn of the dead... it's true! I can't believe it either!
Dance has such a real, unrefined, un-glossy look and feel to it. Like it's a budget movie, but it doesn't know it. And as a viewer, you like the look and don't care cause the story is so damn great and the actors are doing a wonderful acting job and anyway you are sick of all the over done special effects and mega budget Hollywood crap James Cameron and Resident Evil movies, and you wish you were a possessed Linda Blair so you could throw up acid pea soup all over your copy of Night of the Living Dead 3-D, and you thank God you bought it used for very little money!
But anyhow, Diary of the Dead is my favorite George Romero zombie movie, and I refuse to watch any more Resident Evil movies cause they are more about kung-fu action hero grip fighting boss hybrid monsters instead of zombies, so what do I know. Check out Dance of the Dead, it`s full of originality and realism. And if you don't like it, you can always rewatch you bluray of Resident Avatard!",1318896000,,1730,4.287461773700306

I'm an old-timer, so I'm probably more concerned with story and characters than outrageous antics and tits, so if you're of the age this movie was made for, my comments may be irrelevant. This isn't a great movie, but given that I couldn't care less about prom night and other teen concerns, the movie entertained me. The gore and violence was good and so were the laughs. I don't remember any of the jokes falling completely flat. So if you're up for a teenage horror move that won't rock your world, but won't be a total waste of time, Dance of the Dead may do the trick.",1315612800,,628,4.3760683760683765
3540660,3,B001DWFEIW,"Reviews Of Unusual Size!

Re: Some nonsense about a reactor causes the dead to rise on the night of the prom. Death, destruction, bad acting and hormones ensue.

Outstanding: I was quite surprised with how much I enjoyed the first part of Dance Of The Dead. The kids look like kids and they seemed to be up to shenanigans just like kids. The zombie effects are pretty decent.

Unacceptable: The story kind of goes off the tracks once everyone is armed and decide that killin' zombies is more important than survival. The prettyboy band is awfully annoying, but I think that was their intent.

Summary: Overall, an OK teenager zombie movie with some funny lines, plenty of gore, most of which was not CG, and bad acting, but in a good way.

3540667,3,B001DWFEIW,"DANCE OF THE DEAD is a fun watch if one can deal with absurd plot devices.

* The dead come out of the ground as if they are 1 foot down in soil only.
* The zombies are apparently caused by a nearby power plant.
* Zombies can drive cars.
* Zombies enjoy rock music and will ""dance"" to it.  (Instead of eating you.)
* There is a...(Are you sitting down?)...frog zombie.

Other than this sort of thing, the movie is fun to watch with some very funny scenes.  For the most part, the film is full of small scenes that by themsleves are enjoyable.  With that in mind, the movie is watchable.  Zombie buffs will like it and fans of teen comedy will like it.

One issue of note:  This DVD has more trailers for other movies than I have EVER seen on a DVD release.  It seemed to go on forever.  I like trailers, so this was not an issue for me.

The acting is great,the one liners made me LMAO..
and the gore was off the chain. Outcasts really do make the best zombie killers and let's hope these misfits get to the prom before the student body is turned into student bodies. The character of Kyle ""the school bully"" was a treat to watch and the coach was great also.

3540674,4,B001DWFEIW,"I don't own this movie but if I see this movie for a good price I'll be sure to pick it up to add it to my zombie movie collection. This movie is WAY BETTER than the latest George Romero zombie movie, the one where they carry the video camera around through the entire movie. I rate that movie as a piece of irritating garbage.

Dance of the Dead has a lot going for it. You have a cemetary on a hill overlooking three nuclear silos. It seems that nuclear waste is leaching into the groud. The caretaker at the cemetary knows this only all to well. In the opening scene of the movie the caretaker takes some hedge clippers and lops off the hand of a zombie who reaches out of the ground grabbing him by the throat. Then the caretaker casually throws the hand, which is crawling around, into a wheelbarrow with other body parts, arms, a head, etc.

This movie has an entertaining cast of young people, mostly the nerds of the Science Fiction club who could not get dates for the school dance. This was fortunate for them since the zombies beseiged the prom dance and killed most of the kids at the prom.

The movie has the hapless teenager who is forced to deliver a pizza at the last minute by his boss. The boy drives around in a very dumpy old car with a big fake pizza on the top of it. He had just broken up with his pretty girl friend because she said he could not be ""Serious"" and how the boy thought that everything was some sort of joke. So the boy ends up leading others into a funeral home, through the sewer, to save his girlfriend. Another girl runs through the zombies and fetches up a heast to cart away the small group of kids who have taken refuge in the funeral home.

Before the girlfriend had taken refuge in the funeral home with some friends she first had to escape from the cemetary. Her replacement date for the prom was some horny guy who was trying to have his way with her in the cemetary. They were parked at the top of the hill in the cemetary overlooking the nuclear silos. So of course the zombies all decided to come to life on the night of the prom. It was quite cool to see zombies catapulted from the grave and as soon as they were out of the grave they were running their rotting corpses in search of brains and fresh live meat.

These kids meet up with a misfit rock band who had not been picked to play the prom. They decided to stay home and jam in a garage. They were beseiged by zombies but they found out that guitars and music put the zombies into a trance of sorts.

Later the kids met up with the coach who just happened to have an arsenal in his garage, machine guns, pistols, machettes, hatches, sickles, knives, and some plastic explosive putty, aka, C4.

The production value on this movie could have been better. This movie is pretty good but isn't very developed. I give this one four stars for the excellent zombies, some special effects, the cemetary overlooking the nuclear silos, and one scene of zombie kissing which quickly becomes face munching.

All in all this movie is FUN and SCARY too. George Romero, are you watching any other zombie movies? Get some decent ideas and make another zombie movie, and please don't let is suck like that Zombie Diaries movie. What a turd that movie is.

(1.) Made by high school film club for the 25% schoolers who find anything dead more exciting than the challenge of reading. Including those who really believe that all myths are true as in vampires, werewolves, elves, leprechauns, dragons & Satan.
(2.) This film is attempt number 13 in a string of a dozen retreads of the same decapitated very fake heads & hands; fake blood; rubber axes; prom dance at school; running over zombies (of course only after the car doesn't start at first); fake white contact lenses; fake crawling out of graves; very fake eating each other. Spoof is a rationalization. There is no comedy in a total rip-off of other people's work.
(3.) No acting, no script, no story, no emotion, no scariness - really none, not even close.

3540677,2,B001DWFEIW,"""On the night of the big high school prom, the dead rise to eat the living, and the only people who can stop them are the losers who couldn't get dates to the dance.""  That's the tagline for Dance Of The Dead, and with a premise with like that, how can it miss??  I was expecting an over-the-top, comedy-tinged horror ride like ""Re-Animator"" or ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"", but Dance Of The Dead came off (to me) as more of a horror spoof than a horror comedy, and reminded me more of ""Scream"" or ""Cursed"" than of something like Evil Dead 2.  Now, depending on one's individual preferences, that isn't Necessarily a negative, but for me personally it was.

  The end of the school year is fast approaching and preparations for the prom are well underway, while at the local cemetary trouble is afoot with the stirrings of the restless undead.  Sounds good so far.  The local undertaker seems both aware of the trouble and the impending uprising, but not much inclined to do anything about it, other than whack the occasional early-rising zombie and go on about his business.  Neither he nor the movie ever really tells us what's going on with the character, and it didn't work as creating a cool, purposefully unexplained mystery; or succeed as being funny. It Might have worked either way (straight or comedic), but it feels like a tacked-on prelude the way it is.  Perhaps they're planning on exploring this aspect further in a sequel.

  From then on, it continues a path of hitting some high notes while missing others.  There's no one plot point or big hit-or-miss to point to as to why it didn't live up to its potential, it's just that the overall tone feels more like a parody of zombie movies than an actual zombie movie.  It's like I imagine ""Shaun Of The Dead"" to be from the trailers (never actually saw that movie) - the living dead come off as buffoons who don't exactly pose an apocalyptic threat: you can tackle one and rip its arm off by giving it a good yank.  And lots of time is spent trying to set up humorous situations.  I'll admit that some of them worked, but for every amusing scene or joke they were two more that fell flat.  The zombie rampage never reached the kind of over-the-top zest that a movie like this called for, and another flaw is that a horror comedy placing itself on prom night should by definition be sexy, at least some of the time.  Dance Of The Dead didn't really even try on that route though, although the actresses are certainly attractive.

  Alright, on to the good points.  It had a good basis, and competent acting on some characters who could have really helped the show along, they kind of grew on you as the movie went on.  In fact, in the last half hour or so, Dance Of The Dead even started to win me over a bit as the spoofish feel started to wear off in favor of an emerging genuine humor or charm.  If this had kicked in sooner and had progressed more I probably would have given the movie a higher rating.  There was one scene toward the end, involving two characters both in the early stages of zombie infection, that was both tender and horrifying, and hinted at what this movie might have been if it had taken itself more seriously.  Just a Bit more seriously, mind you - I'm not saying it should have had a ""Night Of The Living Dead""-type totally serious approach, but it didn't merely go for fun and laughs, it seemed to be just plain goofing around a lot of the time.  And that was unfortunate, because there were tonnes of potential here.  Obviously a lot of people (judging by the high average ratings here and on other sites) thought it was a great movie, but personally I really wish it had been less of a parody.  The bottom line is that if you've enjoyed movies like Scream, Shaun Of The Dead, or Jason X (the only Friday The 13th I couldn't get into, kind of a deliberate self-parody itself) you'll probably also enjoy this one.  If you're not into the spoof-types you're less likely to really get into Dance Of The Dead.  On a technical level it's not at all bad, and to be fair, if I'm going to classify it as a horror parody I have to admit that it's among the best of its breed - it manages on several occasions to be amusing, it's never dull, and its particular kind of parody seems a bit better-natured and less scornful, less blatantly absurd, than some of its peers.  So you could do worse than this one, but it didn't nearly meet my (admittedly pretty high) hopes.  Leaves itself wide open for a sequel, and perhaps that'll more fully live up to the promise in this great idea.",1242345600,,4562,4.410991636798088

3540679,4,B001DWFEIW,"Dance of the Dead (Gregg Bishop, 2008)

Ever watch an old movie (and here I use the term ""old"" relatively; twenty years will do you) and think ""they just don't make 'em like that any more""? Let me introduce you to Dance of the Dead, the film that really should have been the sequel to Return of the Living Dead. It's got just about everything you could possibly want in a good old-fashioned zombie comedy--some decent gore, a good dose of laughs, and the embodiment of the good old-fashioned tropes of the genre, while still skewering them as often as possible. As a side note, I'd been over at a relative's house just before watching this, and they had Sixteen Candles on; the two make a perfect double bill.

Plot: there's a nuclear plant outside of town. The town gravedigger (James Jarrett) had discovered that the dead are rising, and is trying to keep the problem under control (the movie's first obvious influence should be showing here). All well and good until prom night, when the members of the Science Fiction Club, investigating possible paranormal phenomena, don't take the gravedigger's advice, thereby releasing a horde of zombies. All of whom, of course, head straight for the school, leaving only the misfits who couldn't get a date to the prom to save the city.

Yeah, you've seen it all before in a host of different eighties movies, but never quite like this. (Okay, maybe a little like this in Night of the Creeps). It's witty, it cuts uncomfortably close to the bone for those of us who were geeks in high school,  it's quite well-directed, and it's a great deal of fun. Bishop (The Other Side) has crafted himself a fine little film here, and it's well worth your time if you're a fan of zombedies. *** ",1238371200,,1727,4.630718954248366

When I saw that this movie was made by the makers of The Grudge and 30 Days Of Night.. I thought for sure this was going to be a decent movie, but I was ""DEAD"" wrong!! It seems to me that these film makers had a few days to spare with nothing big in the works, so they slapped together the most rediculous script they could think of.. Then released this trash under Ghost House Underground knowing the public would buy it.. it seems this was a job done with no imagination and no heart just to make a few extra bucks on a name. Those who compared this film with the cult classic Return Of The Living Dead were so far off base that they weren't even in the ball park. Return was a good movie, it blended horror and comedy in a nice way that actually worked.. This movie was just out and out stupid.. The Jokes were lame, we had no love for the characters, there were no scenes that pulled off the creepy vibe and it seemed this was written by drunk teenagers in a dirty bedroom somewhere. It was just great to see the zombies freeze and stop attacking everytime this lame punk band in the movie played their music for the dead.. I loved seeing zombies drive around in a truck and hanging out at their own little prom once they killed everyone at the dance.. What a great and orignal story... NOT!!!!!! I can't think of one positive thing to say about this movie, it wasn't funny and it was not scary.. It wasn't even fun to watch.

""Dance of the Dead"" is a surprisingly enjoyable zombie flick.  It was a bit cheesy at times, but it is expected from a B-movie.  Good zombie films are hard to come by nowadays, but ""Dance of the Dead"" succeeds.  It will satisfy zombie fans with the gore, the make up, and the overall look of the zombies, and it will also satisfy those who love horror comedies with some clever one-liners and some creative zombie beat-downs.  What truly made this movie so good in the humor department was the teenage actors, who stuck to their roles so well playing stereotypical high school clique members.

Dance of the Dead is an up-to-date tribute in some ways to films like The Return of the Living Dead which by itself makes it worthwhile, but there are many elements that also make Dance of the Dead original.  That is actually saying something believe it or not, because there have been countless failures among similar films but this one captures the right tone.

The reason the tone works is actually pretty simple, director Gregg Bishop has the ability to create a decent teen comedy.  He does so by the starting the film with very entertaining characters and the actors do a fantastic job in making us like their funny and sometimes stereotypical personalities that become unique and even funnier given the circumstances.  So we get introduced to a group of humorous characters (my favorites being Kyle and Coach Keel) who are not going to the prom.  Then these characters become the protagonists as Bishop throws a zombie apocalypse into their setting.  Now, overly violent slapstick humor ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Terror/dp/B001F0TM5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Terror</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Stooges/dp/B000SSQ7JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Stooges</a>&nbsp;is my kind of comedy, so if it's not your thing you won't like this, but I doubt you will have even heard of this movie to begin with if you don't appreciate that sort of thing.  So we get an American Pie blue print setting that eventually gets invaded by zombies.  Another reviewer effectively compared it to a John Hughes zombie film in his title, which is actually right on point.

I'm giving this a high rating but I normally struggle in giving movies like this too high a rating.  Usually silly movies like this can take decades to ease into being truly appreciated but I'm willing to bet that in ten or twenty years folks will look back fondly on Dance of the Dead as a horror comedy cult-classic.  Time will tell of course, but I'm willing to make that prediction and give this movie a strong recommendation to those who enjoy similar fare.",1226620800,,3337,6.115631691648822

There might be a correlation between these two principles simply because it is hard to do a zombie comedy if they are running and you are running.  When it is more ""The zombies are coming!  Walk away!  Walk away!"" there is way more time to make with the smart aleck remarks (and to go out for pancakes).

""Dance of the Dead"" is apparently a movie that was a decade in the making, since the writer and diretor met up in film school at USC, which might explain in part why it works so well, because the script by Joe Ballarini exhibits evidence of fine tuning.  The same can be said for the special effects put together by director Gregg Bishop ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Side/dp/B000T28C6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Side</a>,"" who manages not to over indulge in the handheld camera work that so often distracts me (or threatens to make my head explode) in contemporary horror films (i.e., ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>"").  But I think a big part of the success for this 2008 release is that this film follows the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Franco-Zefferelli/dp/B00004SPYJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Franco Zefferelli</a>&nbsp;approach of going out and hiring actual teenagers to play teenagers, which is why so many people make John Hughes references when talking about this film.  The young cast, many from Georgia since that is where ""Dance of the Dead"" was filmed, give it a certain charm (e.g., when Lindsey leads the group in prayer before the ensemble has its requisite ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-The-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B000AQ68RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;movement of striding purposely down the hallway with their array of weaponry, a moment that serves as the backdrop for the DVD's menu).  That also means this film has the advantage of featuring unfamiliar faces instead of twentysomethings from television shows slumming in splatter flicks.

I have no idea what ""Dance of the Dead"" is doing in the Ghost House Underground series of horror films that Lionsgate has put out to distract horror fans from the fact that this year's Horrorfest has been delayed until January (they still only have 5 and not 8 films 2 die 4).  This is far and away the best of the six of eight films I have seen so far, and if there is something better than ""Dance of the Dead"" still out there, that would be really sweet, but I doubt it is going to happen.  This DVD also sets the standard for special features in this series, with audio commentary by Bishop and Ballarini, a featurette on the making of the film, a special look at ""Blood, Guts, and Rock 'n' Roll: Effects and Stunts of Dance of the Dead,"" a handful of deleted and extended scenes (with optional commentary by the director), Bishop's short film ""Voodoo"" (also when commentary, because apparently you cannot stop Bishop from commenting, you can only choose not to listen), and the trailer (which contains the film's one flaw: which is that the best line in the trailer is actually two lines cobbled together, in reverse, from the end of the film).",1225065600,,5904,6.020286396181384

3540699,5,B001DWFEIW,"Now here is a film that truly gets it.  That is, here is a horror-comedy that knows that it is a horror-comedy without blowing it and turning into a joke onto itself.  Instead, we get a cult classic that will be enjoyed over and over by new and old viewers alike.  The screenwriter sums it up completely in his commentary track and the DVD extras; he wanted to get a film that had classic horror elements (in the likes of Evil Dead 2, Shaun of the Dead, etc.) but within the world of high school and it's funny quirks.  So what we get is Evil Dead 2 meets Mean Girls ... and that, my friends, makes one hell of a ride!

The story is about a zombie outbreak that occurs the night of the senior prom.  The local cemetary, next to the town's nuclear powerplant, seems to be plagued by the occasional undead outbreak, kept in check by the local gravedigger (a great character here) who figures not telling anyone but keeping all in check is a way to remain employed and keep his job.

We now turn to a group of seniors (and the occassional teacher), and their teen comedy set pieces.  We get the rock-and-rollers, the cheerleader, the class bully, the pretty class vice-president, the science geeks, and our unknown-to-him hero, the class drifter and his unrealized potential.  The drifter and VP break up right before the prom.  With her new date, a guy that happens to be the class president, she heads to ""view"" the town at the town's highest point, inside the cemetary.  At the same time the sci-fi science club geeks, having no dates to the prom, instead do an expedition to the cemetary for who knows why.  Then the outbreak begins.

The film from this point goes into high gear, rocking the viewer with absolute classic moments of horror comedy but still remaining a solid horror, right there with the best of the genre.  Hilarious moments take place with the class bully, the sci-fi club, and the VP.  Then we get the rock-and-rollers who unwittingly discover a way to stop the zombies while doing a jam session.

The night continues as these different cliques join up together, breaking all school boundaries, to save their prom and their class from a zombie epidemic.  If you are part of the classic B-movie blood-and-[...] viewer, look elsewhere.  There's definately a lot of gore and hilarious zombie deaths, but no exploitation here otherwise.  Instead, check this film out for just being great.

The DVD and its extras are great.  It appears that the director and screenwriter worked together almost hand in hand and as a result we get a great film.  The featurettes and commentaries were great.  Everything was great.  Horror, comedy, teen angst ... all together, we get one great friday night film; just a well made, well acted, well written film.  By the way, did I say this film was great? :-)",1225065600,,2807,4.610887096774194
3540700,4,B001DWFEIW,I thought the that movie was great. I enjoyed the fact that it was more original then most of the horror dreck that has been released lately. The acting was solid and the special effects were good. I would recommend this film if you like the Dead.,1224979200,,247,4.276595744680851
3540701,3,B001DWFEIW,"I thought this was pretty good. It wasn't really what I expected, but that's alright. For some reason, all the zombies come back on the night of the prom. Some of the nerds, and groups of people who didn't go to prom have to save the day and kill the zombies. Something I thought was too silly was when the zombies drove the car, and when the zombies listened to loud rock 'n roll music!

3540702,4,B001DWFEIW,"This was a neat film. Zombies infest the prom with some quirks and humor. If you've ever been a nerd/geek/etc, you will appreciate this movie. Its a typical zombie flick. Zombie movie fans will delight at this one. I reccommend this one if you like zombie movies for sure, and general horror fans should get a kick out of it also.",1224720000,,330,4.426229508196721
3540703,2,B001DWFEIW,"A mildly entertaining zombie flick about a zombie outbreak on prom night. The eventual heroes are the usual assortment of losers who couldn't get a date and even a couple of gals decked out in their prom gowns. The outbreak of the living dead is never explained but the town is bordered by three huge industrial smokestacks which billow black smoke.

One amusing scene finds a three man garage band stumbling onto the idea that the zombies are entertained by loud guitar riffs and drumming.  The zombies stand transfixed actually swaying back and forth to the music.  I was hoping they would show the zombies with their hands in the air waving, holding cigarette lighters. Oh well, you can't have everything. The losers  with the help of a macho Rambo-lite ex-military man, complete with confederate flag in his garage, arms the kids to the teeth with weapons, machetes, sickles, clubs with protruding nails, bats- but no guns for the kids-he's in charge of the guns and explosives.

The movie is gory but how can you take a movie like this seriously when in one scene a zombies body is severed at the waist and the waist and legs run away?

The movie is ok to watch but George Romero won't lose any sleep.",1224633600,,1206,4.63849765258216
3540704,4,B001DWFEIW,"Prom was never like this!!

1) ACTING: I found the acting to be very well done. While the characters were the usual high school stereotypes that we have all come to know, each actor took their role and made everything that could be done out of it, without going over the top and becoming a caricature. And, luckily, none of the teen actors look like they are in their 30's.

2) PRODUCTION: After viewing a number of less than stellar zombie movies, I am happy to state that the people involved in the production of this movie knew what they were doing and show a love for genre. No soundtrack or lighting issues. A couple of very minor continuity goofs appear, but most likely will not be an issue to the general viewer. The zombie make up is really good, with some of the lesser made up zombies relegated to the dark and to the background. The blood and gore is plentiful and usually surrounded by humor.

3) ZOMBIES: The zombies in Dance of the Dead are a mixture of many different kinds that we have seen in various movies and a few new ones. We have the slow Romero shamblers, the fast moving Snyder runners, and ones that can still drive cars!

4) THE CAUSE: nuclear power plant emissions.

5) NUDITY: None.

FINAL: What a wonderful, fun movie! I was disappointed that this did not go to theaters nationwide, as I think, as Shaun of the Dead has proven, ""zomedies"" do work, when done correctly. Think of this movie as a collaboration between the zombie master, George Romero, and the teen movie master, John Hughes. I can't wait to see what comes next from the creators of this movie. This is one Dance everyone should attend!

RATING: 4.5 out of 5",1224633600,,1653,4.453642384105961
3540705,4,B001DWFEIW,"What a great surprise: a teen zombie film that really seems fresh with nice characters, great actors, a well written screenplay, well directed, well shot... and with some truly scary moments.

It's prom night and Jimmy is upset because his girlfriend decided she's had enough of his irresponsible and immature behavior. She goes to the prom with someone else while he has to deliver some pizza. Meanwhile, the geek club (whose members did not find a date) is spending the night at the local cemetery looking for ghosts. ...And that happens to be the night the dead come out of the grave.

Yes, there may be nothing new about the story. It's all by the numbers - something that zombie fans (like me) will enjoy after being tired of films that try to pass up the worst ideas in search of some innovation. Anyway, the characters here a delight to watch. Jimmy is the most adorable loser whose pragmatism is very funny and empathetic. And most other characters are truly funny to watch too.

Unlike many other recent zombie flicks, this one shows a careful production in many aspects:
a) Casting - with solid young actors in solid performances.
b) Special effects - this is a cheap film that actually looks a lot more expensive than it was due to great calculation on which moments demand more money AND where to compromise or not.
c) Screenplay - from beginning to end, the story gives you the goods.
d) Direction - I'm happy to say, Gregg Bishop seems to be fully aware of what he wants to show and where to put the camera. He is also capable of setting up the scene in ways seems cheap to shoot and yet professionally looking and that's quite a treat if you think of the amateurish direction we see on many recent zombie films.
e) Gore - interestingly enough, AFTER watching it, I realized this film has very little gore when compared to other films. Why? Because the story is fast paced, the characters keep you interested and the scenes are good enough to keep you going.

The only lesser elements are:
a) The fact that the zombies here keep screaming ""brains"" (which reminds me of the last two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Living-Dead-4-Necropolis/dp/B000EHQ7YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Living-Dead-5-Rave-to-the-Grave/dp/B000M9BPFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave</a>&nbsp;films that by now seem to have exhausted the original ROTLD idea (those two sequels are below the freshness of this film). I believe this film should have stayed away from any resemblance to the series (that by now is very tired due to unworthy sequels).
b)The lack of a better music soundtrack (especially if you think some of the characters here belong to a garage metal rock band).
c) The makeup could be slightly more spectacular... come on, it's zombies.

Still this film has plenty of goodies to deliver to the viewer.

I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to have some scary-funny night watching a zombie film.",1224633600,,3152,5.207100591715976
3540706,4,B001DWFEIW,"Dance of the Dead was released by Ghost House Underground, which is sort of their take on the 8 Films to Die For and I suppose the Dimension Extreme label as well. From what I have heard Dance of the Dead was hand picked by Sam Raimi for Ghost House Underground and bottom line is this; you'll either really enjoy Dance of the Dead or hate the movie, while most reviews have been more positive this is the type of movie I can see why many loved it and some hated it. I for one really enjoyed Dance of the Dead and it was exactly what I expected.

Dance of the Dead however is as flawed as it is entertaining and quite honestly not everything works here. There are moments where it's too over the top and seems too forced, but other times certain aspects work and it's highly enjoyable. Despite any flaws in my opinion Dance of the Dead has far more good going for than against it. Think of this movie as a John Hughes movie meets Night of the Living Dead or more like The Return of the Living Dead since Dance of the Dead has a lot more of Return of the Living Dead rather than Night of the Living Dead. Dance of the Dead starts off as more of a teen comedy and like I said something in the style of John Hughes, but than the horror kicks in and it becomes something like a John Hughes movie that meets a zombie flick.

The screenplay written by Joe Ballarini and overall it was quite well done, but not everything he does works well. As stated there are moments that are too over the top and moments that seem a bit forced as if Joe Ballarini was trying a bit too hard. But once the middle sections come his script while already good gets better. The characters aren't the best developed characters we've ever come across, but most of them are likeable. Honestly I actually grew fond of a few of the characters and was hoping they would survive. The characters were a lot of fun and Joe Ballarini does very well with the characters he created. Again despite any flaws with the script it does work well overall.

Director Greg Bishop does a bang up job, but like the script there were moments in his directing where certain aspects just didn't work, but for the most part he does well and crafts a very enjoyable and funny movie. Most of the scenes in Dance of the Dead are played light with little suspense, but more of a comedy. Though with that said there are some fairly suspenseful moments in Dance of the Dead, but most of the scenes are played light and it works great. The pacing is solid and there really aren't any moments where the movie is slow. It pretty much always moves forward and always has the fun level working.

The zombies are cool looking and this one has a mixture of running zombies and slow moving zombies. The zombies are pretty much inspired by those from Return of the Living Dead in many ways you can see Dance of the Dead as a modern day version of Return of the Living Dead. Like I said about aspects not working one in particular was a zombie frog; it was only one brief scene, but that's what I mean about things not working, but thankfully it was only one brief scene and that was the end of it.

The cast was solid and all the actors put in good performances with the highlight for me was seeing Mark Oliver as Coach Keel; Mark Oliver starred in Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland as Tony DeRaro. Mark Oliver pretty much steals the show with his intentional over the top performance as a former military man who goes on a zombie killing spree. James Jarrett as the Gravedigger is a brief role, but very memorable. Again as I stated before the characters were really fun and I was hoping quite a few of them would survive.

The gore level is good and it's a mixture of special make up F/X and CGI, but don't worry any CGI used looks pretty good. It wasn't over used and it was mixed with make up F/X so most of the time you won't really notice the CGI and the way it was shot and edited makes it tougher to notice. I hate CG used in horror flicks, but if used right it could work and it was used right in Dance of the Dead

Dance of the Dead is a movie you'll either love or hate; certain aspects fall a bit flat, but overall in my opinion it was a fun ride, but as I stated before I can easily understand why it's also disliked by some people. But I highly enjoyed this movie and it delivered just what I expected. Don't go into Dance of the Dead expecting to see something totally different; it follows the basic zombie movie formula, but still works well in my opinion and was a fun ride.",1224547200,,4529,4.234953703703703
3540707,1,B001DWFEIW,"Seriously, how is this film getting such positive reviews? I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow for negative numbers.

Like anyone else watching this film, I did so because I like a good zombie film.

This isn't one. In fact, its surprising to me that it could be this atrociously bad and still have been released without some sort of warning label such as ""Warning: Total waste of time and money"".

The plot is a mix-and-match of elements stolen from of a half dozen better done films, the acting is barely on a par with that usually found in lower end used-automobile commercials and the cast of characters couldn't be more stereotypical if you tried.

I should know better by now than to let myself be swayed by reviews and comments posted on the box, this one reading that (somehow) the producers/directors of ""30 Days of Night"" (a superb film) and ""The Grudge"" (another winner) were also involved in this one (why? did they lose a bet to someone?)

This one wouldn't even make a decent rental.",1224460800,,1014,4.611111111111111
3540708,4,B001DWFEIW,"I just watched this film, and was really surprised!! I thought it was really great, and for what is pretty much a direct to DVD release, had top-notch effects, acting and story. For those of you that love zombie movies, this is one of the best to come along in awhile... Keep in mind, these are a new breed of zombies altogether - the Running, jumping, car-driving, dancing, and making-out kind. It really didn't bother me because it added an interesting level to the film and worked well in the context that this doesn't take itself too seriously. Bottom line, own this one!",1224288000,,575,4.592233009708738
3540709,5,B001DWFEIW,"Dance of the Dead makes you think of Return of the Living Dead as it is a film done in the same spirit of that '80's classic. While Dance of the Dead is a loq-budget production, which is evident at times, it does not feel like a cheapo straight to video production. This movie has some chills, lots of blood and gore, and loads of laughs. Mega kudos to the director, Gregg Bishop, and his cast and crew for a job well done!!!",1224201600,,425,4.132530120481928

 With bad acting and a bland script, this film sits comfortably alongside Hatchet and the Day Of The Dead remake as the worst dvd releases in the last year. For real horror/comedy see ""FIDO"" instead.",1224201600,,452,4.305882352941176

This is your typical teen zomby film that has been done to death, and back apparently. However, I just couldn't help but like this movie. It's got plenty of splatter, gore, and of course tongue-in-cheek zomby humor. The FX are real good too. It's the kind of fun horror movie that went out with the 80's, or so I thought. The kind where your yelling things like ""Oh man, did you see that?"" So if you like zombies, or just fun (funny) horror movies...this is a good one to rent, or maybe even buy.",1223942400,,639,4.333333333333333
3540713,5,B001DWFEIW,"I recently watched ""Dance of the Dead"" at the Rome International Film Festival.  We attended only because it was filmed in Rome and our friends were zombies in the movie, but I have to admit the film surpassed my expectations.  Not only were the special effects well done, but I was amazed by the way the zombies were thrust out of graves in ""real time"" landing on their feet running.  The house featured in the film ""the funeral home"" was very exciting to me because my family actually owned and ran the house as a Bed and Breakfast (a side note would be that the house is actually located directly across from an actual funeral home!)  I'm not going to ruin the movie for any one but you just need to know that the movie was extremely well done and I would rate it up there with ""Shaun of the Dead"" as a humorous zombie film.  For all viewers.....wait for the first Zombie Make-out scene that I've ever experianced!!!  Fun for All!",1220659200,,933,4.395348837209302

I just don't know why they're not releasing it to theatres first because it's alot better than most of the crap in theatres today and well worth the admission price. If you ever get to see it on the big screen don't hesitate to see it.
