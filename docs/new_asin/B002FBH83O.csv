I wish other fans and non fans could see

The picture quality and sound were perfect.

3921691,5,B002FBH83O,"This documentary presents a concise, detailed, and truthful look at Michael Jackson's 2005 child molestation trial and the 1993 allegations that preceded it.

3921692,5,B002FBH83O,This was so different from all we see on TV. I think everyone who was a fan or not should watch this.  It makes me happy to see how many fans and and friends MJ had all over the world. It is sickening that some are so cruel and that the media looks for anything negative.  How hard this must be for celebrities and their families.  Very touching footage and I would recommend it.,1247702400,17,379,4.094594594594595

A world famous Star and Humanitarian accused by a deceptive family, coaxed by the Law Enforcement, and manipulated by rating hungry world media Networks and their reporters.....
It's An Honest open minded look behind the Beautiful Gates of Neverland Ranch, MJ and lets you see what the Media and Sheriff's Office did not reveal, or want you to know. I loved this documentary and watched it twice upon it's arrival, and you will want to too.  In addition, I appreciated Larry Nimmer taking the time to contact me about a possible delay of delivery and the new updated ending that was added with the Jackson Memorial services. I Still received it very Quickly and way before estimated delivery date !! Thank you for such a Great DVD !!!",1247616000,89,836,4.76551724137931

3921695,5,B002FBH83O,"I would have given this book 100 stars, if I had the choice to do so!. This book (from start to finish) tells the honest truth about Michael. His life had never been easy, from when he was young, right up until he left this earth. All he wanted out of life ""was to be loved"" and appreciated for ""WHO"" he was, not ""WHAT"" he was. Michael was one in a million, he could have anything he wanted, but not what he wanted most. The media called him whacko jacko,which infuriated me and millions of other fans as well. Michael wanted to be like a normal person and do normal things, which everyone takes for granted. But because Michael was so popular, he never had the opportunity to do that :( Everyone called him weird when he built Neverland, they never gave him a chance and never once tried to understand him or get to know the real Michael :( But I can say, after reading Karen's book ""Defending A King"" that she took a lot of time to research everything about Michael and for that I am grateful and very happy :) More people should take the time to read this impressive book and learn what Michael was all about, how he lived and why, how he felt etc!
I also thank you Tom Meserau from the bottom of my heart, for being their for Michael when he needed a friend the most. I was never lucky enough to be able to see Michael in Concert or meet him in person and that will always be my biggest regret in life :( A lot of people never knew about the hundreds of charities that Michael selflessly helped out and how many people in this world he gave to, he was such a humble, generous and giving man, who deserved so much more. Thank you Karen from the bottom of my heart for putting your whole heart and soul into this amazing book. I am so glad that someone finally had the guts to let people know the truth about Michael.

Even if I only believe half of it, I honestly hope everybody who was part of that unbelievably rotten machinery will sometime in their lifes get to the point when they need help - and may god only send people like themselves to their side.

There is still no interest in telling the truth, isn't it? It can't be explained in any other way that documentaries like this one never air!

3921711,5,B002FBH83O,"I have always known in my mind that Michael was inocent but having read so many different stories that the press have put out in the past it was good to be able to see first hand the tape that the jury watched which proves without a doubt that the Arviso's were a family of money hungry griffters who set out to ruin Michael by lying and making the most disgusting accusations against him.  What upset me about it was the LAPD'S attitude towards the search of Neverland with regards to breaking down doors(they threaten to do this at one point if they can not get in) and when they question the Arviso boy (can't even bring myself to say his name) they are so against Michael the boy could have said anything and they would have believed him.  Just watch the boy's body language when he's saying what happened. he's such a bare faced liar.
Anyone who doubt't Michaels innocence will find this enlightening.  Michael was ALWAYS innocent!!!!!

This is Larry Nimmer's footage that he was hired to shoot for the '05 trial, as well as footage of the Arvizos that convinced me of Michael's innocence.  Larry, as far as I know, was NOT a fan.

I was surprised to see interviews by the Arvizos (those low-life sociopaths) and the police interview of Gavin Arvizo...obviously NOT telling the truth!  Its plain to see why the jury could not convict MJ of anything based the lies told by the Arvizo family or the obsurd charges by the DA who only sought to make a name for himself by destroying the life of an innocent man.

I enjoyed seeing into Neverland, but wish there would have been more of that...like a real virtual tour, though I understand the purpose of this video.

3921720,5,B002FBH83O,"I think this is one of the real things, telling the truth. It gives a summary for those who did not see all the information on internet. Worthwile buying, especially to have it as a means to show to people that are no MJ fan (yet). We have to let the world know Michael Jackson, not the image the media showed to the world. It is time everybody starts to be curious what a tremendous artist, and above all, human being he is. He will love forever. Larry, I have been on internet for more than 4000 hours in the last year. The information is overwhelming. I think you can make another great DVD showing more of the humanitarian side of Michael, of how he was, there are so many stories about people who's life he influenced for the better. He stood for gread values. DVD's like that should be aired on TV stations. This info has to be ""thrown"" at people. The media ""threw"" so many lies and distorted stories on him to the audiences, why not confront the same people now with the truth and the beautiful person that Michael was. This is the only justice that Michael can have and get. Let us all demand for that. Thank you Larry for the beautiful vid.",1279238400,2,1149,4.299539170506913

3921722,5,B002FBH83O,"I never thought Michael Jackson did thoses horrible things they said he did. He was very lonely and had the money to fill his void of loneiness. Many people took advantage of him (even some rotten kids) to get some of his money. Shame on the prosecution for framing Michael back in 1993. What people won't do to become famous for trying to bring down a person who is globally know. May he Rest In Peace.

3921723,4,B002FBH83O,"This is an excellent documentary that is good for those who know a bit about the trial but haven't spend a lot of time of discerning fact from fiction.
So for those it is an excellent way to get some more facts.

For those who are bit MJ obsessed anyway- nothing that you couldn't know already by following the trial information etc. Transcripts are public so anybody with a real interest could identify most of the information.

I felt a bit guilty watching his private quarters and seeing book titles scanned knowing how he hated someone drawing conclusions about him as a person through the books he read and that material was made for a trial, so you kind of have to see it that way because no way on earth would have Michael Jackson shown anybody his private reading stash on child raising.

I also find the initial ""dramatic introduction"" a bit over the top because it toys with his innocence. There is no need to create added drama in the style of TV show.

If you have the chance of producing a documentary without TV producers chopping it to bits in trailers to create as much ambiguity as possible to lure in people- I would have refrained from it.
I understand that Mr. Nimmer clearly stated that he went into the job initially  not being convinced one way or the other- that's fine.
However this documentary is clearly being a positive one, stating his innocence and this documentary (I would hope so...) is being released from the stand point of vindicating Michael Jackson- I found the ambiguity and the innuendo in the beginning unnecessary just to please as wide an audience as possible.
And that is the reason why I only give it 4 stars.

The cover could be more professional, most 3d semester film students have better covers for their movies.

I give it 4 stars because that kind of information NEEDS to be out there in an easy to digest format because most people don't have the time and nerve to dig through trial transcripts- and the mainstream media for sure won't bring it up for public consumption.
Therefore kudos to Mr. Nimmer for releasing it, we need more of Nimmer and Jones and less of Bashir and Dimond.

Thank you Mr. Nimmer.",1274572800,,2158,4.558139534883721

I hope they now are ashamed of themselves but too late for poor Michael.  He gave so much and this is what they did to him.  The raid on Neverland was just a circus, and created havoc and despair in the life of a good man.  Every disbeliever needs to see.",1273708800,4,365,3.958904109589041
3921728,5,B002FBH83O,"Part of me wanted this DVD because of wanting to see more glimpses of Neverland but it will shake you to your core to understand what happened there that day.  More than 70 law enforcement officials swarmed the sanctuary and home of a gentle, innocent man and turned it into a public spectacle, violating him in such a disgusting, inhuman manner. This was a colossal ""witch hunt"".  Only his ""forced"" physical  examination could be have been worse.  He was treated like  some kind of unearthly terrorist.  Is it any wonder he could never, ever return home?

Michael missed out on so many wonderful experiences of childhood so he sought to recreate it by turning this ranch into a child's fantasy paradise.  The children and adults who had the true pleasure of experiencing Neverland and possibly meeting Michael, were treated to an unforgettable day of fun and excitement.  Michael Jackson's heart was pure.  It is the evil that exists in all of us that caused him to endure so much pain and mental suffering because of perverted thoughts about things that never happened there.

I am so grateful for Larry Nimmer's determination and insight to produce this video.  He does a great job of narrating it, too, describing the depth of violation that took place.  What did these cops expect to find?  It's what they didn't find that proves the insanity of this raid!

How i pray that a caring journalist  takes this DVD and the two books--Redemption and Michael Jackson Conspiracy--and tells the true story about Michael Jackson and how he was demonized and destroyed by a blood-lusting DA, a jealous filmmaker, a legal-savvy and greed-motivated family,  and a horribly biased media.  People need to know that this man was innocent of all charges.  He deserves to be remembered for his genius talent, compassion and humanitarian efforts.

In summation, you will want this DVD if you are a fan.  While it is heartbreaking to watch what took place there, you must realize that you have an important document that captures images of the beautiful place that Michael's magic created.

Watch it and let it motivate you to join the legion of fans that won't rest until Michael's name is respected and revered for his goodness, talent, and pure love of children.

There is much discussion disputing the claims and you get a glimpse of all the players including the attorneys on the case.  Although a one sided view of the trial, for those who are interested in finding out what went on behind the scenes, it gives you a visual of some of the goings on.

3921733,5,B002FBH83O,"This was well worth the money. Larry Nimmer filmed inside the gates of Neverland Valley Ranch, Michael Jackson's home. The documentary shows the Neverland Michael had dreamed of ... the amusement park, the zoo, the statuary of playing children, the guest house, inside the main house, the train. Nimmer remained open-minded and objective in his narrative at a time when objectivity was just a concept that no one was paying attention to. Much easier just to trash a life behind lies and innuendo than to investigate, research.

I particularly enjoyed the outtakes from Bashir's documentary. They showed the deviousness of Bashir coaxing Jackson to reveal more and more of himself that ended up broken and bleeding on the cutting room floor in favor of sensationalizing for ratings. This is a sickness in our national media that we must innoculate ourselves against. Otherwise, we will end up losing more and more of our brightest and best to media invasion and the need to tear down those in positions of brilliance. Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Princess Diana, and Michael Jackson ... who's next?

The interviews with Mr. Mesereau and Aphrodite Jones were extremely well done. The rebuttal interview with Jackson's accusers was also very telling. The taped interview with the accuser by the sheriff's department showed a lot of the character of the child in question. I pray for him daily. May he, finally, admit the truth and some remorse for his part in killing Mr. Jackson.

Tom Sneddon, Larry Feldman, the psychologist, Martin Bashir, and the tabloid and mainstream press corps, should stand beside Conrad Murray in a court of law and all should face charges for their parts in destroying one of the most talented human beings on our planet. I pray that their parts in destroying one of the most beautiful souls our world has ever seen will not be forgotten when they face their creator.

The world should view this documentary and weep for the parts we all played in Michael Jackson's demise by buying and believing their crap. We are the only ones that can curb our out-of-control journalists. There was not one iota of truth in the accusations of this child ... or the one from 1993. Our media made absolutely certain that we didn't know that. Instead, they were drooling over their anticipation of covering Jackson's life behind bars and the daily sound and video bites that would perpetually boost their ratings dollars. It was a conscious decision on their parts.

But a beautiful human being, a prodigiously talented singer, dancer, videographer and composer, a doting father of three, a world-class humanitarian is gone just the same ... destroyed by their lies.

Mr. Nimmer: Please make sure this documentary is viewed on a more widespread basis. The world NEEDS to see this footage. And thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm sure Michael would thank you, too. If he were still here to do so.",1266451200,7,2913,4.9105691056910565
3921734,4,B002FBH83O,"I always believed that Michael Jackson was innocent of any of the false allegations that were brought against him. I'm a fan of MJ but this is not the reason why I believed in his innocence. The reason is simple - common sense. There are so many things that just points to the fact that he is a good person.  Some accusations hurled against him were just ridiculous and unbelievable and for this to happen in a country like America makes it very sad. Whatever happened to `innocent until proven guilty'?  How can there be so much hatred and negativity towards a human being who just wanted to share not only his talents but his time and material possessions to help other people? How can some people (especially Tom Sneddon) be allowed to operate this way, waste taxpayer money and humiliate an extraordinary person along the way? Most of all how can we have a media who  just doesn't have integrity and allow people like Martin Bashir, Dianne Dimond and the rest to have jobs? These people are malicious and liars and they are still allowed to practice in their profession (although they are not 'professionals' in the true sense of the word)? How come we can allow so much lies to prevail? Well, this is the society we live in now. For these people who want to destroy other people for their own gain - let their conscience bother them...

So far this is this is the best DVD I have seen which is an honest account of the truth.  Like the others I just wish that it was shown worldwide a long time ago. I would also recommend Aphrodite Jones' book - `Michael Jackson Conspiracy' and Geraldine Hughes ""Redemption - The Truth Behind the Michael Jackson Allegations'.  I also want to mention my admiration for Tom Mesereau  and his team for making the truth come out.  Truth and good people always triumph at the end.

One thing I didn't appreciate though is Larry Nimmer's comment about MJ's face. I felt that wasn't necessary.

I would have given this DVD a 5-star rating but some parts of it don't play well and it stops sometimes.  It also has some very blurry parts and bad sound. Otherwise it was great and refreshing to hear something sensible and truthful!",1266105600,2,2163,4.548969072164948

Of course, there are also outtakes from the famous Bashir documentary, as well as points from his lawyer, and the jury foreman of the trial. This is a lot of powerful footage and I highly recommend viewing it to get a fuller picture of the situation surrounding the singer.

3921738,5,B002FBH83O,"This is a great DVD.  It provides validation for anyone who already believes in MJ's innocence and if you are undecided or think he was guilty; this may change your mind.

It is ""interesting"" to see how the police ask Gavin leading questions and almost put words in his mouth.  Also noteworthy is how certain claims by the Arvizos such as being held prisoner and not being able to find out what time it was are disproved.

MJ tried to help this boy and his family; Janet, the mother proclaims this herself and it is sickening to see how they abused and used his charity and love.

There are also outtakes from the Bashir interview who showed only certain scenes which included his own commentary to make it appear that MJ was suspect.

In addition, there are also 8 special features that include the police search, victory celebration by the fans and discussion between Aphrodite Jones who wrote The Michael Jackson Conspiracy and Thomas Mesereau...Michael's attorney.

A must have for anyone interested in the FACTS of the case.",1264809600,2,1029,4.747191011235955
3921739,5,B002FBH83O,"i bought this on larry's website and actually discovered more facts regarding the trial.  as someone who has followed all of
this since 1993, i personally never knew that the arvisos and the prosecution claimed that they [the arviso family] were prevented from knowing the time.  that seemed very odd, since every media shot of neverland almost always shows that huge grassy clock.  i also was curious when i saw janet's booking photo at the time of the infamous jc penney case...she looked fine to me. didn't seem to be upset, crying, injured, etc. as someone who claimed to have been beaten up in a parking lot by the jc penney security.

my only critique to larry would be if he could include chapter selections in the main content. for example, if i were rewinding or fast forwarding to something i wanted to see...it would go right back to very beginning or very end.  but other than that...the information and facts are well worth it.  i especially liked the mini-interview he did with tom mesereau and aphrodite jones in the extras. and the in depth interviews he did with mesereau and the jury foreman. and of course gavin's 'confession' to the sheriffs.  that kid looked a lot bigger and older than what the media was portraying and he didn't come across to me as someone who was traumatized from sexual abuse.  and i agree with aphrodite...how does a 13 year old boy not know basic questions about sexuality?  and seeing him in a football uniform...that totally blew me away.  you mean to tell me you play football and deal with guys who are stronger than michael jackson and you let him touch you and not do anything about it? there's also some outtake footage the arvisos did and shows them being very spontaneous, and at times, not knowing they were being taped. [they claimed it was all scripted and that michael's people forced them to say all those nice things about him]

for all of you still wanting to know more facts about the trial, def. get this dvd.  larry's team responded very quickly to me and i got the dvd in a very timely manner.  i hope one day, him, aphrodite, geraldine hughes and tom mesereau will all go on larry king and really inform the public on all the facts surrounding this case.  it really saddens me that there's still many people out there that are still mis-informed or too ignorant to know the facts.",1264464000,2,2346,4.594724220623501

In my opinion everyone needs to see this and it's a shame that this was never shown on national and international TV.  However, as usual anything telling the truth about Michael Jackson seems to get boycotted/ommitted by the media...

I had to order this via the US (I live in the UK)as there are no websites/shops that sell this in England.  Hopefully this will change so that it can be shared with as many people as possible (everyone I know didn't know that this DVD existed).

This shows that MJ was indeed innocent of all the nasty allegations made against him. It also shows those who stood to gain if he had been sent to prison and their motives to get a guilty verdict; i.e. for money, prestige and their fifteen (or more) minutes of fame.

Well narrated by Larry Nimmer and very insightful as to what went on behind the scenes.  I can't recommend this enough - please buy it!",1263686400,4,933,4.452941176470588

I know this won't help to bring Michael's image or Michael back but this will help us to see the side that most of the time people don't see. specially people who involve in this case ( to show it to the world how bad those people are after he is helping so much for them this is what Michael got). I'm a Buddhist so i belive in Karma Michael has done so many good Karma in this life some people even can't imagine or do that in 1000s of life so he will be in very good place and I'm sure those people will understand what they have done but they are too late but please don't let this happen to somebody else ( I mean to a good person )Michael was strong thats y till he go he could survive no matter what people and media say about him and you can see how much he care about his children as example i live in Australia i remeber i was reading article some of parents saying when he visit Australia in 1996 when he visit some Hospitals and visit some children ( ill children ) they health came back to normal because not he is magic or kind of god or any supernatural just because he is so caring and he was genuine but saying that I'm not saying he is kind of god or the greatest human being lived on earth no i'm saying he was a very great man try to do good things but same time he was human being but he was  keep doing good things he go people hate it because he was one of kind you won't see that talent again maybe another life time or maybe forever once again Mr Larry Nimmer thank you so much and Mr Massarau thanks for helping Michael not because he was the Greatest star because he was a good person i think those good Karma will help you when u do something and it will help ut lives and finally one thing i can say if you do bad those things will come behind you like ur shadow look what happend to first accusers father he suicide it's sad because nobody deserves that but that's how it is so people should be very carefull all the Michael fans should buy this to help Larry Nimmer and same time it's good to see something about Michael pls try to broadcast this on TV Mr Nimmer,1262044800,,2326,4.045553145336226

It paints the true picture of Neverland. That of a fairyland; not one of evil. I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them. It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word.

3921748,5,B002FBH83O,"i have read ""michael jackson conspiracy"" and that goes into so much detail about what i saw in this dvd, so i had a fuller understanding watching the movie.

this dvd -

1. seeing footage shot for the jury's virtual neverland tour
2. michael jackson's accusers speaking on the record
3. the sheiffs raid of neverland
4. the accuser making his accusations on camera during a police interview
5. clips of mj from the martin bashir documentary
6. highlights from mj's career

extras section -

1. mj speaking from the martin bashir documentary
2. shows tours of neverland taken with larry nimmer commentary
3. neverland sheriffs raid outtakes
4. clips from the aborted rebuttal video by the arviso family
5. tom mesereau and aphrodite jones disscussing the trial
6. mj's victory party in las vegas
7. messages to michael from his fans
8. mj's fans mourning his passing in los angeles and neverland

this dvd shows what an outstanding job tom mesereau does in mj's defense, prooving his innocence, which ended up being the verdict! i loved the part in the martin bashir documentary where michael jackson starts climbing a tree - i always have loved climbing trees and have done it to think by myself and have deep discussions with my friends ever since i was small and on through college - so i can totally relate with that part of mj. it makes me angry to know that martin bashir was trying to put this and a lot of other things about mj in a very untruthful and negative light. i also like seeing the michael jackson impersonators at the party scene in las vegas - some of them were pretty good at what they do - it was really cool to see how much support surrounded mj by his fans. the other thing i will mention that i thought was so sweet was the letter that paris wrote to mj during the trial - ""i love you daddy so much more then that get well daddy - love paris""

THEY ACTED LIKE HE MURDERED SOMEBODY, WITHOUT FINDING OUT IF IT WAS THE TRUTH. THEY COULDN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO BE HOME? THEY RAIDED HIS HOUSE, DRILLED INTO HIS SAFE AND DOORS, TO GET GIRLY MAGAZINES, TAKE PICTURES OF SOME NAKED STATUES. THIS MAN WAS INNOCENT!!! THEY PUT THIS MAN THROUGH HELL AND NOW WE HAVE LOST HIM FOREVER. WHY CAN'T SOMEONE DO GOOD, WITHOUT IT BEING ALWAYS SOMETHING STRANGE OR WRONG? YOU CAN NEVER SEE OR TRUST THE GOOD IN SOMEONE, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE EVIL UNTIL IT HITS YOU IN THE FACE. NONE OF US ARE PERFECT!!! GOD TOOK HIS ANGEL BACK AND I HOPE HE IS HAPPY AGAIN.

3921754,5,B002FBH83O,"Anyone who still believes there is any shred of doubt as to MJ's innocence or guilt should watch this documentary. By simply presenting the facts of the 2003 allegations brought by the Arvizo family, it is an eye-opener in how one very greedy and manipulative family managed to ruin the life of a great entertainer and gentle soul whose only ""guilt"" was that of being too trusting. While it could be argued that the documentary is decidedly pro-MJ, it nevertheless offers an intelligent and insightful alternative to a media frenzy that has too often gone overboard in the opposite direction. As Jackson's attorney Tom Messereua reminds us at one point, the general public was never allowed access to what transpired in that courtroom. And everything that we did hear was slanted by a sensationalist-seeking media to make Jackson appear guilty. This documentary takes us behind the scenes and shows us what we were never allowed to see or hear in 2005. And after watching this DVD, it certainly gives you a much better understanding of why the jury came to the decision that they did, and acquitted Michael Jackson",1257292800,3,1114,4.8994708994708995

Although I appreciated the various categories documented as extras along with the main documentary of ""The Untold Story of Neverland"", it actually brought tears to my eyes to see that the media/press needlessly chose to ignore the factual circumstances of the court fiasco! Since the media filled the courts during the trail, they were aware of this photographer, Larry Nimmer's factual Neverland video presentation to the court and deliberately chose not to report it!

Michael didn't deserve ANY of this!!! I always knew he was completely innocent, but to see these conniving officers desecrate his beautiful home was sooo disgusting! As I cried, feeling so much pain, I kept thinking how Michael felt! This was HIS home yet I felt like I was the one being stabbed. That alone lets one imagine just how deeply HE was hurt! It just angered me all over again! Neverland was fantastically beautiful!!! It was undoubtedly understandable why MJ refused to live there anymore the way they defiled his peaceful territory with their evil spirits!

On the positive side, you get to hear Tom Mesereau (Michael's attorney), author Aphrodite Jones (The Michael Jackson Conspiracy), author Geraldine Hughes (Redemption), and MJ fans! Although I'd say this dvd is a keeper, it's also a great one to share with those who're skeptical about MJ's innocence because this dvd is all the proof they'll need to see how wrong they were in believing the media/press lies.

As a new Michael Jackson fan, I'm grateful to Nimmer for this effort. In a world filled with the likes of the Arvizos, the Chandlers, Larry Feldman, Stan Katz, and the countless others who betrayed Michael and attempted to extort money from him throughout his life, it's an enormous comfort to know that Tom Mesereau, Susan Yu, Larry Nimmer and Aphrodite Jones are also part of this world.

3921762,5,B002FBH83O,"This video was very interesting and enlightening to the truth behind the accusations and the trial. Mr Nimmer presents the documentary with sincerity, and expresses his initial uncertainty over Michael Jackson's guilt or innocence, which gives all the more veracity to the account.
He presents the information fairly and by showing original (fascinating!) footage of the police interview with the boy accuser as well as the family's rebuttal video, he allows the viewer to make up their own mind about the truth. For myself it was clear immediately that the boy was lying and acting a part and that there was nothing believable about the accusers at all. I found it amazing that the prosecution purported to believe it and that they thought anyone would find it convincing.
I also appreciated the interviews with the Jury foreman and with Tom Mesereau, who come across as honest and with great integrity.
This DVD was a great taster! - I feel that Mr Nimmer has much more material which would be very informative to see. Having said that, I was left almost reeling with shock that Michael was put through such hell on the basis of such obvious lies. Although I hadn't believed that Michael was guilty, I had not expected the accusations to be so poorly constructed, to lack any real substance, and, as such, to have made it through the processes to get to trial. I truly cannot understand the role and motives of the police in this. Why was none of this reported by the media? Why did they ignore the truth and condemn him on the basis of pyjamas?

Why wasn't this shown on T.V. all the Michael Jackson Haters out there need to see this DVD, as trusting as he was they broke his heart, and tried t make him out to be a monster, all I have to say is get all the facts before you condem someone, Oh yeah I forgot truth doesnt sell.....Thank you for this video",1252368000,6,377,4.04
3921774,5,B002FBH83O,"I agree with everything Tina Grimes said in her review.  In fact, I feel so strongly that the MEDIA--even mainstream--was hell bent on convicting Michael Jackson that I created a discussion board to talk about ways to restore Michael's reputation as the children-centric humanitarian that he is.

This group, called ""Vindication Better Than Tributes,"" supports full and irrevocable vindication of Michael Jackson BY MAINSTREAM MEDIA. Michael was already exonerated by a jury of his peers in 2005, but that's not good enough. For the sake of Michael's children, and for the health of society, mainstream media must become more responsible. This group will discuss the manner in which truth can compel mainstream media to examine its methods and publicly admit that it wrongly accused--and continues to accuse--Michael Jackson of despicable crimes. Many people still believe Michael was guilty. They were influenced to believe the allegations by an out-of-control and biased mainstream media. This was wrong and continues to be wrong. To a high degree, mainstream media has gone tabloid and is very destructive to many, many people's lives.

Here are the members of mainstream media (not a full list) who have--directly or peripherally--denigrated, mocked and/or ridiculed a good man--and continue to do so.

The List of Shame:

Gloria Allred, Martin Bashir, Diane Dimond, Willie Geist, Nancy Grace, Ian Halperin, Jay Leno, Bill Maher, Michael Medved, Jim Moret, Bill O'Reilly, Maureen Orth, Joan Rivers, Chris Rock, Diane Sawyer, Mark Steyn, Jeffrey Toobin, Young Turks

This group is NOT about vilifying the boys who falsely accused Michael of these crimes. They were kids who were easily manipulated by their parents. Our official position is that no matter how egregious the parents' actions were, these two children (now young adults) may still love the only parents they have. Jordan, especially, was a pawn whom Michael defended in an interview. Michael said he ""knew the child's (Jordan) heart"" and he would never have done this on his own. Our desire is that Jordan will summon the strength to come forward and vindicate his good friend, Michael, who loved him. We all need to gather around him and make him realize we support him so he can do this.

Here's the group address:  [...]",1251676800,11,2290,5.186991869918699
3921775,5,B002FBH83O,"This documentary serves as an excellent visual aid to understanding the false allegations made against Mr. Jackson during his 2005 trial.  It exposes the Arvizo family what they truly are.  These allegations were only made after Michael learned from Chris Tucker and Jay Leno that this was a family he needed to steer clear of and Michael began to distance himself from them.  This is an excellent insightful piece on understanding how easily someone can be falsely accused and how the media will do anything (I mean ANYTHING) to increase their ratings!  Michael Jackson once said ""lies run sprints...but TRUTH runs marathons.""  In the long run, the whole world hopefully will know the truth behind these allegations and Tom Sneddon.  Also, it gives a brief glimpse into the false allegations in 1993 which were made after Mr. Jackson refused to invest $20,000,000 into the boy's father's movie script which was briefly reported on CNN years ago but of course it didn't get 24 hour coverage like the sensationalism does.  Excellent job, Mr. Nimmer, on this visual account of the accusers and their history of trying to ""milk celebrities.""  However, for a detailed account of what really happened in the trial, one needs to read Michael Jackson Conspiracy by Aphrodite Jones...now that is a GREAT book and well documented regarding the facts.  The 1993 allegations are well documented in ""Redemption"" by Geraldine Hughes.  These three pieces of work put together truly tell the story of how Mr. Jackson was falsely accused and how his life was destroyed thanks to the media capitalizing on anything they could sensationalize.  I'm sick to my stomach that the entire world does not have enough curiosity about the truth to watch this documentary and read these two books!",1250726400,23,1769,5.023972602739726

3921777,5,B002FBH83O,"Dear Mr. Nimmer,
Thank you for producing this revealing DVD.  It gives us such an insight to the truth behind Michael Jackson's evil accusers, the pompous Sheriff's Department, the vindictive Tom Sneddon, the backstabbing Martin Bashir and the dreadful media.  We would never see on television what you have shown us on this DVD, never.  I'm glad you were the one hired to work with the Jackson defense team to film Neverland for the jury.  Because of your neutrality towards Michael Jackson I feel this DVD was produced in a credible manner on your part.

My husband and I were extremely appalled watching the Sheriff's Dept. invade Neverland... especially knowing they waited until Michael was out of town (he may even have been out of the country).  It was clear they were all mesmerized being in Michael Jackson's house.  I hope all these money-grubbing people who have sent Michael to an early grave are living with the heaviest, nagging convictions of their evil deeds to the point of insanity!  Sorry, I had to vent here.  Of course, this DVD only solidified what I have believed all along.  I hope all the MJ haters and the ""fence-sitters"" really consider watching this DVD.  Too bad, for Michael's sake, this piece wasn't produced and aired on television after the trial, but I am very happy it is available at all.  It will serve to comfort Michael's children and his family.

Thank you, again, Mr. Nimmer for a superb DVD in Michael's defense.
P.S.  this dvd didn't play in my dvd player, but played perfectly in my laptop.",1250380800,10,1534,4.761363636363637
3921778,3,B002FBH83O,"I moved this review from 3 stars to 5.  Originally, I purchased this product and the DVD didn't work.  However, Larry Nimmer was gracious enough to send me a new DVD. I truly enjoyed viewing it and would like to thank Larry for his narration and awesome work.  The scenes at Neverland,the court room, interviews, etc. were really interesting. I think differently about the accusations now.  Anyone viewing this DVD will most likely believe Michael was innocent of the charges.  Larry added additional footage of the news regarding Michael's passing and this is truly a historic event to have on DVD.

May he rest in peace and thanks again Larry for bringing his story to life.",1249344000,32,676,4.7844827586206895
3921779,5,B002FBH83O,"I have watched Michael Jackson for years. A few months ago I bought his concert DVD for the dangerous tour which is great. I wanted to see more of Neverland as it was when he lived there but more importently I wanted the whole story behind the trial and accusations. This video provides just that. Very well made and edited. It takes you through the trial issues step by step and allows you to form your own optinion. T was told I had to wait for addtional footage to be added before it shipped and that was worth it. At the end there's footage of the funeral service, celebrations and more. If your a Michael Jackson fan then you really need this video!",1249171200,11,654,4.32520325203252
3921780,4,B002FBH83O,"I never believed that Michael Jackson was guilty of child molestation. Not because I'm some over the top or obsessed fan who believes that an icon can do no wrong...because that's not who I am. I'm just a 42 year old woman who grew up listening to some Michael Jackson tunes once in awhile. I loved some of his songs, and I hated some of his songs. But I was never one to follow his every move, nor did I watch every music video, or try to catch his every appearance on TV. I was however always intrigued and captivated when I did see Michael on the screen or hear his music. He had a talent that commanded attention, and a passion for helping others, especially children, and I always admired him for that.

So I remember standing in my living room when I caught a glimpse of Michael on TV, as he spoke out against the horrible crimes against a child for which he had been accused. Just looking at the pain in his eyes and listening to the power of his voice, I did not see a child molester. Whatever they were accusing him of, I just could not believe to be true, because I could not see one trace of guilt on that man's face, nor in his voice as he pleaded with the world not to condemn him for something he did not do.

But the media sure seemed to paint a different picture of Michael Jackson, one that seemed to convict him early on. And it was so insane to me that so many people suddenly looked at him and talked about him differently, as if it was just so easy to believe he was guilty. Because after all, if a man likes children, he must be a pervert too, right? And when he agreed to settle with the accusers for a large sum of money, that seemed to make everything worse. To many people, that made him guilty.

When the second case came along, it definitely didn't help Michael in his efforts to rebuild an image that had become so badly tarnished. And for many who had their reservations about his innocence before, the new charges erased any doubt. But not for me. My very first thought was, someone wants money--they saw him pay off the last family, so surely he'd pay again. Easy target. And as the trial unfolded, I watched with sadness as this once energetic and magnetic personality seemed to withdraw even further within himself, inside a cocoon of obvious pain. He was acquitted of every single charge, but he was condemned in the minds of many people and viewed as some freakish form of evil (his obsession with plastic surgery only seemed to add fuel to this fire). And you could tell when it was all over that Michael Jackson had become a different person, a shell of his former vibrant self. I can only imagine how betrayed he felt by his accusers, and by those who would believe the most vile of lies about him. No wonder he left the country!

When I found this DVD last week, I ordered it right away and couldn't wait to watch it, and it definitely confirmed to me what I have believed this entire time: MICHAEL JACKSON WAS INNOCENT! As was noted in the DVD, if he was guilty of anything, it was only bad judgment. But he sure paid a high price for that, in so many ways.

I only wish that this video had aired on TV long ago, to help combat all the lies and negativity that followed MJ even long after the acquittal. More people need to see this DVD. More people need to know the truth--that Michael Jackson was a talented, compassionate, and caring human being, who had flaws just like the rest of us. But he was not a child molester; rather, he was a victim of lies and outright extortion, and of the tabloid journalism that would follow him until he took his very last breath.

I can't help but wonder how differently things might have turned out, if this video had been broadcast on national TV sometime after the acquittal. Surely, it would have had a positive effect on how people viewed him. And that could have had a major impact on the course of Michael's life over the last few years. Who knows what might have happened, had Michael not felt the need to run away from the spotlight after the trial, and from a public that seemed only too happy to vilify him. But we'll never really know, will we?",1248912000,288,4134,4.30719794344473
3921781,4,B002FBH83O,"this documentary is good, it is not as complete as one migh hope but it give what the jurors saw during the trial and it give a better understanding of what Michael jackson was about and why he was acquitted, i think this with aphrodite jones and geraldine hughes books gives a better understanding of what Michael was about: love.",1248825600,14,331,4.533333333333333
3921782,5,B002FBH83O,"It's sad that this documentary has never been shown on TV, because I imagine it would open the eyes of a lot of people who still believe Michael Jackson is guilty, despite the innocent verdict.  Why do they still believe that?  It's because of all the negative media Michael got at the time. Unfortunately those who already have their minds made up that he was guilty are not likely to buy this DVD, which is ashame, because they really should.

I feel this documentary proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Michael Jackson was innocent.  It takes you through Neverland, talks about the claims made by the family of the accuser (that they were all held hostage at Neverland among those claims) as well as their more Michael-positive rebuttal video, talks to a jury member of the trial, shows the interview with the accuser and the police, and lots more.

I recommend this for everyone.  Whether you believe he's innocent (I always did) or guilty, you need to see this documentary. I will always continue to defend Michael whenever I can, and this movie had some great facts to add to my argument.",1248480000,24,1097,4.628865979381444
