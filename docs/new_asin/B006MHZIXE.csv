8500891,4,B006MHZIXE,Received this film timely and in good condition. Overall a very attractive film with a lackluster story line. I'd say 6-9 year old would enjoy it most.,1492473600,,151,4.62962962962963
8500892,4,B006MHZIXE,"Wonderful art and story. Initially we watched in the original French language, then ordered and watched the English version. Still like the sound and feel of the French original! We don't speak French but there you go!",1473465600,,218,4.918918918918919
8500893,2,B006MHZIXE,"Was not pleased with how excessively nasty the businessman father was in his work and personal life. Was also disappointed with the role of the Migoo... hoping they would be more conservation focused and less goofy and bumbling. The mountain troll-witch (whoopi goldberg) seemed frightening for no good reason and she took the little girl's sentimental amulets which were never returned. Then the troll-witch never appeared again and it made her character seem unnecessary.  The animation was lovely though, as were the scenery shots and landscapes. Mia is one tough little girl who showed much bravery and strength which was welcome. Felt too scary for my 5 year old but my 10 year old liked it okay.",1424736000,,701,4.9914529914529915
8500894,5,B006MHZIXE,"This spectacular tale is the story of a bold girl, Mia, who sets off on a dangerous journey to find her father, and a boy who accompanies his cruel father on a business trip. The roads of the two kids cross and result in a thrilling adventure about saving the tree of life in a tropical forest together with the mystic Migoos.
Producer Jaques-Remy Girerd truly created a master piece of animated beauty and wonder with brightly colored landscapes and unique characters.
Recurring themes of the film are respect (towards beings and nature), relationships between children and their parents and environmental protection.
Mia and the Migoo touches your heart deeply. The little girls faith on her journey is as powerful as the magic of the cuddly giants. The views, drawings, colors and animation in this film are amazing. A must see!",1420156800,,831,4.900709219858156
8500895,2,B006MHZIXE,"It's clear that the creators were inspired by Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke, as it has similar themes of human development encroaching upon nature, and a being representing all of nature being shot by a human and endangering the whole world.

The movie directly took some of Mononoke's set pieces, with a frightening canopy covering the sky (red mist in this movie, black ooze in Mononoke), and the male and female protagonists coming to in restored world, covered by grass. I mean, if the inspiration was any more obvious, there might've been some legal ramifications. They even ""borrowed"" one of Mononoke's voice actors. The guy who played Gonza (John DiMaggio) in Mononoke is the main antagonist in this movie.

But Princess Mononoke this movie IS NOT. Not as beautiful, not as character-driven, not as riveting, not as epic, not as thematic, not as thorough, not as rich. The animation is refreshingly different, like crayon drawings brought to life, and that almost makes it worth watching. But the plot, the dialogue (at least in the English translation), and the characters are all pretty poor.",1360627200,,1100,5.071823204419889
8500896,5,B006MHZIXE,"From GKIDS, the theatrical distributors of The Secret of Kells and A Cat in Paris, Mia and the Migoo is a heartwarming story about a young girl who sets off on a journey to find her father. Little does she know what she will also see, meet and find along her way. She is fearless, a little bossy at times, and very independent. In this fable-like quest she must also overcome her fears and help innocent, bumbling forest spirits called the Migoo save the ancient Tree of Life that is being threatened by money hungry developers.

I love this film! It has a beautiful eco-friendly message of hope, healing and change for the better. This film took 6 years to make. Created from an astonishing 500,000 hand-painted frames of animation, the gorgeous second feature from award winning French director Jacques-Rmy Girerd and animation studio Folimage is a work of art, breathtaking to behold. Its rich backgrounds and colors are reminiscent of famous paintings in watercolors and pastel. It has won best animated feature in the European Film Awards and the HSBC Environmental Film Award.

This English version features voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Modine, James Woods and Wallace Shawn. Bonus features include ""Making of"" Featurette & an Interview with the Director. Total movie run time is 91 minutes long. It is rated PG for thematic elements, some peril and brief mild language so you may want to screen it before having your children watch just in case.

My children, especially the youngest were entranced by this film and thought the Migoo were funny and strange. Zari, my very youngest loved it every time a jungle critter would appear. I thought the bus scene was great! My boys loved the meteorite shower scene because they love looking at the stars themselves and it reminded them of the meteorite showers we will have on August 11th and October 20th.
