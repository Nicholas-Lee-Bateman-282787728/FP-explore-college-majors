1017892,5,630537497X,"I first read my issue of Tokyo Pop to hear about this Anime.  I couldn't believe the raving reviews those guy's gave it!?  They are usually HARSH on anime (like their poor review of Revolutionary Girl Utena), but since they  ranked it so highly I realized I had to see it.  The cover and artistry on  the back did not please me, and I was horribly afraid I would be  disappointed...until I watched it!!  This is one of the better Anime I have  ever seen!  The dubbing was not only good, but EXCELLENT!  Childish at some  points, it had it's moments where it was very much fun for the older crowd.  Even my friends, who are TERRIBLY picky about what they watch were  addicted to it!  i can't wait to see the rest and to see the television  series, Master of Mosquiton '99!",937785600,,771,4.293706293706293
1017893,5,630537497X,"Ok this is a great anime, but is extremely kiddy at times.  The only reason I would say this got a 13+ is because of certian expanding body parts (which is still very funny considering the sound effects they used.)  Still I would say almost anyone could view this video without worry.",935798400,,284,4.4423076923076925
7888577,5,630537497X,"There are many great animes that get passed over except for a select group of intense anime fans.  This is definitely one of them (it is not even avaliable on DVD, only VHS).
Master of Mosquiton is the tale of the firey-haired and attituded Inaho, who is in search of the mysterious O-part that will make her immortal (and therefore young and beautiful forever).  To aid her in her quest, she awakens the reluctant vampire (well, part-vampire) Mosquiton.  Along with him comes two lackeys, the fire-breathing Hono and the icey and seductive Yuki.  This vampire-comedy tells the tale of what happens to the four on their adventures inside of a giant pyramid.
This anime is so great for two reasons.  First, the storyline is solid and interesting.  Who ever thought that a vampire-romantic comedy could be so good?  And unlike other vampire animes like Vampire Hunter D, there isn't much gore, and the focus is much more on comedy than scare tactics as Mosquiton, Hono and Yuki try to keep Inaho from falling into traps.  This is the OAV version of the show (2 episodes per tape spread over 3 tapes), and although there is a televsion version called Master of Mosquiton '99, this has a much tighter and more interesting storyline.
Second, the voice actors are really talented.  Mosquiton is voiced by the splendorific Koyasu Takehito, best known for roles such as Touga in Utena, Hotohori in Fushigi Yuugi, Kira in Angel Sanctuary, and Aya in Weiss Kreuz (among many others).  Inaho's voice actress is Imai Yuka who has done various small parts such as Wakaba in Utena (typecasting?), Hono was voiced by Ueda Yuuji (Houjou-kun from Inuyasha, Daili from BGC 2040...), and Yuki's voice is Neya Michiko (Rally in Gunsmith Cats, many small rolls).  With an experienced and versatile cast such as this, the strong storyline really comes alive.  This is a definite buy for anyone who likes  fun, unique comedy-adventure anime.",1073606400,,1918,4.882716049382716
7888578,5,630537497X,"Any viewer who is a major fan of ""Inuyasha"" will definately love this.  The relationship between the two main characters (Inaho and Mosquiton) is unbelievably similar to that of Kigome and Inuyasha.  The movie's humor and use of sexual innuendo will make it enjoyable for all audiences (though some parents may not approve of the nudity which comes in an abundance in the second volume). One thing I must note to all who know nothing about these 3 volumes is that they're all 60 minutes long each, and they all consist of 2 episodes running 30 min. apiece rather than one movie running 60 minutes. However this does not take away from the plot as many would think, but rather helps enrich and intensify the plot to its final conclusion in the last volume.  The many misadventures of Inaho and Mosquiton keep the viewer interested and is a must-see for any anime fan seeking a light-hearted anime with a slightly less-complicated plot than that of animes such as ""Akira"" or ""Jin-Roh - The Wolf Brigade"".",1069977600,,1002,4.714285714285714
7888579,5,630537497X,"There is very little I can say about Mosquiton that is not insane screaming about how good it is, but I will try my best to give a bit of a sane review.
This series is absolutely hilarious, has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard (though that's iffy for Lew Temple who just shouldn't have long pieces of dialogue at all), the best writing, and one of the most original plots ever.
Think Indiana Jones crossed with Bewitched and Dracula, and you've got Master of Mosquiton.  Poor Mosquiton, who has been sleeping with his minions Yuki (ice) and Honou (fire) for the last few years in the Hitomobore family crypt is awakened by the newest of that line, Inaho, to help her find the mythical O-Part, which will grant eternal life and youth.  And thus the globe (and moon) hopping adventure starts in the 1920s.  Add to this the fact that Honou and Yuki hate Inaho, that Mosquiton's in love with her (and vice versa) and that Mosquiton's got not only an old enemy, but a 300 year old wife waiting for him , and you've got the insanity that is Master of Mosquiton.
This is a great series.  Even for a non-anime fan, you can't fail to find fun in this miniseries (too short!  too short! they must translate the rest of the TV series, even if it isn't as good as the OAV).  The voice acting in English and Japanese is top notch, the writing is absolutely fabulous, and the animation is a sort of off beat wonderful.
If you want something different, something that will make you laugh, that will make you thirsting for more...check out Mosquiton.  I promise that you will enjoy it!",1024185600,,1582,4.43448275862069
7888580,5,630537497X,"Waaah! Mo-chan! *glomps on Mo-chan* I never knew vampires could be so, well, cute! Consider me smitten - or bitten. ;-) What's a vampire to do when every person he bites falls madly in love with him, but the girl he loves (why DOES he love her, anyway?) treats him like a dog? You've just got to check out Mosquiton and the rest of the maladjusted monsters in this series!",1001203200,,372,4.328571428571428
7888581,5,630537497X,"I went out and bought this because it looked good and no one owned it.  I am so glad that I did!  This is possibly one of the funniest animes I have ever seen.  Mosquiton is very cute, although I can't understand why he goes for Inaho, the main character.  Inaho is annoying and manipulative, and she doesn't know how to shut up.  Hono and Yuki are fun characters that you can totally feel for if you've ever been stuck in a situation with someone that you don't really like.  There are some great lines in there too.  If you want to see this and don't know anyone who has it, then you should definately buy this video, it's worth it!",988243200,,634,4.190082644628099
7888582,5,630537497X,"I loove this anime! Hono and Yuki have awesome sarcastic dialogue, and Mosquiton pulls of the exasperated-but-i-love-you thing so well ^.~ And  Innaho...well i don't know what else there is to say about her except that  she's a brat, but in a way that has you rooting for her because although  she may be a little manipulative, somehow that makes her even more  admirable! Buy this anime!  Oh and I have to say I am in love with the end  duet..its soo kawaii! Buy this anime!  Mosquiton and Innaho forever!",966902400,,506,4.555555555555555
7888583,5,630537497X,"I brought this video just on a whim. It was listed in the beginning previews with another tape I purchased. The animation style is different from what I'm used to seeing, yet I really liked it and the video. The  charactors Mosquiton the vampire brought to life again by a mortal female  he calls Inaho and his two unusal servants who look like children but when  using their powers become teens. One fire and the other ice, which pretty  much somes up Mosquiton's and Inaho's relationship. It's a strange but fun  loving one I'm sure you'll enjoy. This is a great movie or should I say  series since there's more than one tape, so if you're looking for something  to watch that'll make you laugh I recommend this one for you.",956188800,,726,4.4961832061068705
7888584,5,630537497X,"Funny, erotic and sweet - Master of Mosquiton is wonderful! It's lightly scary - not overly bloody at all. It's quite sophisticated & witty and the plot is wonderfully sentimental - Mosquiton is a vampire, resurrected  by his Master(rather, Mistress),beautiful Innaho, in the 1920s. It seems  he's bound to serve her family and she, after falling head over heels for  him, goes on a quest for the O-part, a mystic relic that will grant her  immortality. But she wants her immortality not for selfish reasons, but so  that she & Mosq-y (as she calls him) can be together forever. This is a  wonderful anime that any fan of japanese animation shouldn't miss!",948412800,,656,4.8125
7888585,5,630537497X,"By the first scenes, I was laughing hysterically. I really didn't stop until the end, when I was dissapointed...because it was over! I can't wait until I get the second one! ""Yea, shnooky wooky pookums!""",943228800,2,203,4.828571428571428
