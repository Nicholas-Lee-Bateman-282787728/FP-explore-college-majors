8038740,5,0767011929,"This A&E biography of Donna Reed gives us a broad overview of her 40 plus years in film and television. Picked by studio executives from a newspaper photo where she won a college beauty contest, she signed with MGM, where she was soon cast in her first film ""The Getaway"". She went on to star in many more MGM films including ""The Courtship of Andy Hardy"", ""They Were Expendable"", ""The Human Comedy"", and more. She actively persued the role of ""Alma"" in ""From Here to Eternity"" even though the director and producer didn't want her. They finally agreed to test her for the part, and she won them over, and won the Oscar for her performance. In the 1950's, she and her husband, Tony Owen, came up with the idea of a television series for Donna - ""The Donna Reed Show"" where she played a not so normal housewife. She was splendid, and the series ran for 6 years. She had an amazing life and wonderful persona. I always wished my mom was Donna Reed.
