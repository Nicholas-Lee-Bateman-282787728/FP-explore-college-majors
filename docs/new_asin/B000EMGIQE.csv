8111298,4,B000EMGIQE,"This was filmed in 1988 in a period when Argentine tango was in the infancy of its comeback.  Most recent documentaries of tango tell its history from the perspective of the immigrants to Bs. As. and the references to the brothels.  This one however has less on that part of the history and more about the period of the ""lost generation"" characterized by the draw of other musical/dance forms and the period in which tango was forbidden in Argentine for political reasons. Most documenatries ignore the political period with its arrests.  Throughout the narrator as the dance asks ""Who or what is tango.""

The strengths of this DVD include that part of the history, the interview with Robert Duvall in which he elaborates on what drew him to the dance and a wonderful milonga.  Stage shows like to present male dancers as guapos, but this elimates the flashiness. I enjoyed the inclusion of the interviews of Juan Carlos Copes and the music of Daniel Binelli. Copes relates his conversations about the Russian dance style and the discovery of Julio Bocca.

The film has the feel of the rediscovery of a lost family connection.",1291766400,,1126,4.808290155440415
8111299,4,B000EMGIQE,"Finaly a documentry with real danced Argentine tango with normal people, realy improvising on the music. Not everything I like in this video, there is a part with Ballroom tango and a choreographed dance (orgenised by an american program for latino's) that misses the point, but I like realy the end, a ballet , but it is beatifully danced in real Tango stile, that means heavy, down to the ground.",1003536000,11,398,4.7
8111300,4,B000EMGIQE,"Somewhat overwrought in its politics, but this film does put tango in its cultural context.  This film shows ordinary people dancing the tango and talking about the dance they love.  It contrast the real tango in Buenos  Aires and the acrobatic tango you see in shows.  This film is insightful  and passionate and beautiful and sad, much like the tango itself.",935452800,30,360,4.836065573770492
