It arrived in about 3 days after my ordering it, and she was in love. My mom called me once after receiving it (to say thank you), and called me again after watching a few of the episodes. She enjoyed it and laughed lots.

If you are a fan of King of Queens, you definitely have to purchase this.

And I have seen some harsh reviews about this (ppl not receiving the actual dvd, etc), all I can say is if you buy, purchase from Amazon, and not a seller. Only purchase from a seller if you trust that seller because you probably will receive a knock off or a ""burned dvd"" that someone just copied.",1290297600,5,761,4.0
3938534,1,B002JH2EJ2,"I ordered the King of Queens Fan Favorites DVD and when I opened it the label on the DVD also said this but when I played it the DVD was one of the discs from Season 8 of the King of Queens. Since I did not play it for awile after I bought it, it was past the return date. I didn't know that I should check it, I usually don't have to check any DVD that I buy. So, not very happy review.",1273622400,3,387,3.619047619047619

8371492,5,B002JH2EJ2,"King of Queens will remain in our hearts forever.  One of the funnist sitcoms of all time.  This DVD is the last few episodes of season 9.  We say goodbye to Doug, Carrie and everyone's favourite Arthur.  I wished they could have included some behind the scenes of filming the final episode.  I recommend this to all King of Queen fans.
