988608,4,6305205787,"A burlesque show on Broadway, at the Old Opera House, is the locale of several killings of women artists. The relationships between the artists and the staff of the theatre are closely examined in both their daily or nightly life and their way to cope with the crimes. In many ways the film is funny, burlesque in itself. The very prompter of the crimes is the hostility between old operatic arts and those modern burlesque musicals that are invented by the America stage in the twenties and thirties. It is a lesson too that no evolution can be stopped, only slowed down. The most interesting trait of the film is the appearance of Barbara Stanwyck as the leading actress. She is better known for her roles in the Western series The Big Valley. We find her here at the beginning of her career and it is fascinating to see how she is already what she will become. In Hollywood many actors and actresses only exploit one potential of theirs and rarely try to create characters that are completely different one from the other.

988609,4,6305205787,"An unusual though entertaining Stanwyck vehicle based on Gypsy Rose Lee's novel entitled THE G-STRING MURDERS.  Stanwyck is enjoying her first taste of success on the burlesque stage where murders eventually upset the merry atmosphere!  Apparently, Stanwyck didn't forget her early Broadway hoofing as she excels in her role. She's great as Daisy (the Gypsy counterpart) in the movie and adds vitality and mirth to a very jazzy part.  The cast of chorus cuties couldn't have been bettered: gum-chewing Iris Adrian; squeakie-voiced Marian Martin; gravel-voiced Gloria Dickson; imperious Victoria Faust; statuesque Stephanie Bachelor; sarcastic Claire Carlton; cutesy Janis Carter and all the rest.  The only time the production slows down is during the murder investigations..... Michael O'Shea, a basically Broadway actor had great chemistry with Stanwyck and their scenes together fairly sizzle.  Stanwyck surprised many with her rendition of TAKE IT OFF THE E-STRING, PLAY IT ON THE G STRING, complete with appropriate bumps and grinds!  Arthur Lange was nominated for an AA for his scoring.",1004227200,,1093,5.554216867469879
988610,2,6305205787,"The only real reason to sit through this melodramatic kitsch-filled dramedy is Barbara Stanwyck. That and the fact this is an actual adaptation of the famed stripper's foray into the world of literature. Yes, folks, this slight film is based on the one, the only, Gypsy Rose Lee's story, entitled, ""G-String Murders."" It's campy fun now, but when it was penned, about 50 years ago, this was major no-no territory. My, how things have changed. Demi Moore should have watched the real pros when actors had faces, and real acting required more than forming tears at will. Stanwyck always knew she could act, and that formidable presence makes anything she stars in palatable. And who would've thunk Pinky Lee did more in his life than entertain kids....",971395200,6,750,4.913385826771654

Two members of the girlie show have been strangled with their own g-strings; and the fiend is among the employees of the Old Opera House where the daily shows appear. Dixie, Barbara Stanwyck, refuses to let the killer scare her or the other performers out of the Old Opera House. She begins her own investigation to find the killer before he/she strikes again. Michael O'Shea plays one of the burlesque comics and becomes her partner in solving the identity of the phantom murderer as well as Dixie's love interest. Most of the film takes place back stage. However, there are stage numbers performed throughout the film. Stanwyck's dancing and gymnastics on stage are incredible for an actress who seldom did these things in her other films.

988857,5,6305205787,"Based on a cheap pulp novel called ""The G-String Murders"" written by notorious stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, this role was a very odd choice for the then superstar Stanwyck to take, who, by 1944 was the highest paid woman in America. While considered a strange and somewhat B-level role for an actress of her stature, a four time Oscar nominee, Stanwyck clearly liked something about this script and brought the main character a life and personality a lesser actress could not have possibly pulled off. The film is a heavily sanitized version of the sleazy book, but Stanwyck is gorgeous in this flick as a stripper caught up in a murder mystery, and her legs are killer in the skimpy costumes. I had almost forgotten that Stanwyck started as a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl and dance instructor. Good entertaining stuff!",1362700800,3,812,4.848920863309353

988876,5,6305205787,"I am being dead serious here...99.9% of all copies of this film are nothing more than cheap public domain prints. Most are shoddy, fuzzy copies that will only disappoint you. Furthermore, if you are like me, you're not interested in a synopsis of the plot - you want to find the best quality copy out there.

I can do better than that - I have found the STUDIO ORIGINAL !!  Just look where it says ""product details"" and look for ""studio"".  If the ""studio"" listing is for ""Image Entertainment"", then you have the original print! All the other copies are fakes...this is what fools everyone. Unfortunately they just take a guess, buy from the wrong studio release(one of those companies that makes cheap bootleg-quality copies), & get ripped off. If you found my review before buying, then you will be spared from all the guesswork! And your copy will look as good as a normal Turner/MGM release (like Casablanca!)

Remember to look where it says ""studio: Image Entertainment"" - that is the original film. William Wellman made this as an independent release, so you won't see a familiar name like Warner, Fox, Universal, etc(your guarantee you aren't getting a cheap bootleg copy). That is what makes getting a decent copy of this film so hard.

988877,5,6305205787,"Had this fun little murder mystery from William Wellman not starred Barbara Stanwyck, it would certainly have been relegated to ""B"" status. As such, it is very fun and entertaining to watch, and the perfect ""B"" movie for a rainy night. Most of the more risque elements of Gypsy Rose Lee's 'The G-Sting Murders' already seemed tame by the time this was filmed in the early 1940's, but it offers a bit of nostalgia for the viewer today.

Stanwyck's Dixie is the center of this lighthearted look at Burlesque and the people who starred in it, hoping for the break that would get them to Broadway. What goes on in the old opera house where Dixie is playing, however, is as far removed from the Great White Way as one can get. During a raid by the cops, Dixie finds hands around her throat when the lights are out, and barely escapes with her life. She ponders whether a real killer might be around while fending off the brash Biff (Michael O'Shea), a comic in the show who's smitten with her. When a fake Princess (Stephanie Bachelor) shows up and the boss wants to bankroll her in a show, the claws come out and soon murder and blackmail take center stage while Dixie and Irish (Biff) do some snooping of their own.

The tone is easy and light, making for an amusing ""B"" mystery with a romantic ending. A nice cast includes: Iris Adrian, Charles Dingle, Victoria Faust, Frank Conroy, Gloria Dickson, Pinky Lee, Marion Martin, J. Edward Bromberg, and Gerald Mohr, who would later star on radio in a famous detective series. Stanwyck seems a bit uncomfortable at first, but once this one gets going, it has a certain charm you'll find enjoyable as the girls argue and romance while a killer prowls among them. This one's only for fun, with no real tension. On a rainy night, with a big bowl of popcorn, however, it's a fun time.",1269043200,,1823,4.5212121212121215

This film is based on famous stripper Gypsy Rose Lee's novel, ""The G-String Murders"". Stanwyck plays wise-cracking ""lead stripper"", Dixie Daisy. She works in a burlesque house owned by Bromberg. O'Shea plays a comic who has the ""hots"" for Stanwyck---initially, Stanwyck does not share his sentiments, and they engage in a running verbal sparring match. When some of the other strippers begin to turn up dead---strangled with a G-string---Stanwyck and O'Shea join forces to find the killer, which they inevitably do. Along the way, Stanwyck falls in love with O'Shea.

This is an entertaining little film and Stanwyck, as usual, turns in a good performance---she is convincing as the ""worldly-wise"" stripper(and reveals as much of her flesh as the Production Code would countenance at the time), and does an adequate job singing, ""Take It Off The E-String, Play It On The G-String"". The movie provides yet another example of Stanwyck's amazing versatility and ability to play an incredibly diverse range of roles.

988880,4,6305205787,"In theory, LADY OF BURLESQUE is a murder mystery, but mystery takes a back seat to the brawling backstage antics of crossed love affairs and star rivalry. Barbara Stanwyck endows star stripper ""Dixie Daisy"" with her own memorable brand of tough class--and although she can only be shown from the waist up when she bumps and grinds, she still manages to tear strips off her musical number ""Play It On The G-String."" The rest of the cast is equally memorable, many of them burlesque stars in their own right. Pinky Lee (Mandy) is memorably teamed with Marion Martin (Alice Angel) to delightful effect; Iris Adrian (Gee-Gee)is the gum smacking brash blonde to end all gum smacking brash blondes; and such memorable character actors as Michael O'Shea (Biff), Gloria Dickson (Dolly), and J. Edward Bromberg (Foss) round out the cast superbly.

Sad to say, LADY OF BURLESQUE has fallen into public domain, and it has not been well preserved. I have seen several releases of the film, and all of them are plagued with breaks in the film and the soundtrack. LADY OF BURLESQUE may never be regarded as a ""great"" film, but it is an extremely entertaining one, particularly for those who already know something about the now-lost world of burlesque.

988883,3,6305205787,"""Lady of Burlesque"" has been in the public domain for years with some lousy prints. This DVD is probably the best available. Even so, the soundtrack is still often hard to hear and there are some jumps in continuity. A pity too, because this is a very entertaining film.

Gutsy William Wellman directed the laconic Barbara Stanwyck in a role which returns her to her roots on Broadway. She sings, dances, throws off the wisecracks and easily dominates the screen with her witty performance. She is beautifully paired with the underrated Michael O'Shea as a Burlesque comic and surrounded by as tough a group of broads as ever assembled - foul mouthed Iris Adrian, dumb Marion Martin and bitter Gloria Dickson are standouts. The film is very clever because while the censorship would not allow anything too raunchy, Wellman brilliantly creates the tawdry backstage atmosphere of a burlesque theatre.

The film is based on famous stripper Gypsy Rose Lee's novel ""The G String Murders"".  The murder mystery is trite and secondary to the byplay.",1236470400,2,1041,4.971264367816092

988927,5,6305205787,"In 1941, Simon & Schuster published a mystery novel called ""The G-String Murders.""  On the title page was the name of author Gypsy Rose Lee.  Yes, the very same Gypsy Rose Lee who is ""Baby Rose"" in that musical based on her early life, ""Gypsy.""  The book is set in a burlesque theater densely populated by comics, strippers, stage crew, hangers on and one serial killer.  The several crimes were eventually solved by a stripper who was coincidentally named ""Gypsy Rose Lee.""  By the standards of the time, it was a good, solid story in a racy setting.  The book was a best seller.

In fact, Gyps did not write the book, although her autobiography published many years later and her successful stint as a talk show host on Bay Area television certainly suggest she had the gift of gab for it, if not the inclination.  The book was actually written by Craig Rice, a well-known and popular hard-boiled mystery writer of the day.  Gyps provided the hook, the background, a few anecdotes and some dialogue.  Rice put it all together, exchanging writer's credit for the payday the book generated.

(By the way, ""Craig Rice"" was also a false creation.  In those days, literary detectives were hard drinking, hard-boiled and surrounded by hard-hearted dames.  Only men could write about such he-men, no ladies need apply.  That being the case, or so a vastly knowledgeable mystery book specialist informed me many years ago when I first inquired about the true authorship of the book, a certain lady created ""Craig Rice"" to play on an equal footing with the boys.  In the end, she outshone all but the very best.)

In 1943, the book was toned down a bit to be filmed as ""Lady of Burlesque.""  Sadly, Gypsy Rose Lee was not cast to portray the fictional ""Gypsy Rose Lee.""  That was a shame, because Gyps was funny, gorgeous, sexy and she brought an instinctive hauteur and class to her down-and-dirty art form.  She was a hoot!

In Gyps' place was cast Barbara Stanwick, who was funny, gorgeous, sexy and who brought a much more earthy persona to the film than Gypsy would have done.  Since everyone knew that Barbara wasn't Gypsy, her character was renamed to ""Dixie Daisy"" and her position in the hierarchy of theatrical stars lowered by several steps from that of the actual Gypsy Rose Lee.

Dixie Daisy is the headliner of a big-time burlesque review that plays at an old near-Broadway theater in New York that once had known the heady glory of being an opera house.  She is a stripper, but she also has the lead in the review's big singing and dancing production number.  In addition to that, she is the wise-cracking dame with the ever-running motor in the skits of the comics.

Michael O'Shea is cast as the Top Banana among the comics, Bitt Brannigan, and a very young Pinky Lee (no relation) as  his Second Banana.  When the comic skits actually appear on stage, though, it instantly becomes clear that Pinky, a real-life burlesque comedian, is a natural-born Top Banana, while O'Shea, funny hat, baggy pants and all, just fades into the painted scenery.  Sadly, the comics perform material created for the movie rather than such classic skits as ""Floogle Street"" or ""Slowly I Turned.""

Off stage, Bitt Brannigan is the hard-edged, generally unreliable, vaguely comic, vaguely heroic love interest for Dixie.  Watching O'Shea, who was competent but never rose to the top rung in Hollywood, it struck me that he was so obviously doing a Bob Hope impression that I could only wonder whether the part was originally intended for Hope.  Hope and Stanwick, now that would have been something to see!  Certainly, Top Banana Hope would never have faded into the scenery for the likes of a mere Pinky Lee.

There is another excellent Second Banana in the cast.  She is Iris Adrian as Gee Gee Graham, Dixie's pal and sidekick.  Iris was a short, brassy, blowsy, bosomy, wise-cracking blonde whose name was largely unknown to the general public, but whose face and voice would have been instantly recognizable.  In movies, radio and television, she could be counted on to appear whenever Abbott and Costello or Jack Benny or Bob Hope needed a reliably astringent dame.

Stanwick is terrific and as red hot as the old Production Code would allow.  (Even so, I wish Gyps had got the part.)

""Lady of Burlesque"" is not a great picture but it is as entertaining as all get out and a true credit to the old studio system.  That's worth five stars as far as I'm concerned.",1185840000,2,4455,4.71280724450194

But this old Barbara Stanwyck movie is kind of fun to watch -- not only is there a genuinely baffling murder mystery, but there are lots of over-the-top costumes, silly characters, and a street-smart heroine who doesn't let anyone push her around. Oh yes, and the guys will love the jiggle.

At the Grand Ol' Opry, Dixie Daisy (Barbara Stanwyck) is the star burlesque attraction -- she sings, dances, jiggles, and manages not to get embroiled in the backstage catfighting. But soon things take a nasty turn: snotty stripper Lolita is found -- poisoned and strangled with her own G-string. (What a way to go) Perhaps even worse, autocratic Russian diva Princess Nirvena returns to the stage, nudging Daisy off it.

Both the police and Dixie begin investigating who might have killed the dead woman. When Nirvena is found strangled onstage, the Ol' Opry faces indefinite closure. And Dixie begins to uncover a web of blackmail, adultery, suicide and family hatred -- and a very shocking reason why someone has been murdering the girls.

Despite being set in an old burlesque club, don't expect lots of skin. I've seen picnics with a higher sex factor. Instead, the filmmakers had more fun with the murder mystery angle, Stanwyck wittily rejecting a smooth Irish comedian, and the ambitious strippers brawling and verbally slicing each other. It's deliciously catty.

The murder mystery is a pretty solid one, with plenty of suspects and some police chases, only to lose steam near the finale. But the script is tight: the dialogue is as spicy as the 1940s censors would allow, and it's full of snappy one-liners(""When I dress for a date with you, it'll be a suit of armor and brass knuckles!""). And the scriptwriters had some fun, with the comics frustrating the cops.

Barbara Stanwyck plays Lee's alter ego, and she does an excellent job. Her Daisy is a street-smart, independent girl who is still warm-hearted and loyal. A few characters -- like the idiot blonde Gee Gee (Iris Adrian) -- are more than a little annoying, but the majority of the supporting cast is solid.

  I believe that every actor or actress who ""breaks out"" into fame has one film that you can point to and say ""THIS is why she is a star.""  LADY OF BURLESQUE is that film for Stanwyck.  It has everything she is known for, plus a vaudevillian side that was not often seen in her other work.  She really was an all round talent, a triple threat.  She acts, she sings, she dances, and boys, she bumps and grinds.  She's lovely and a tomboy.  What a treat.  It's all here.

  What is even better is that this film has all that too.  It is a backstage murder mystery set in the seedy world of Burlesque.  It has realistic behind the scenes shots that have rarely been equaled.  Backstage usually IS this run-down, even in the best theatres, and when you're waiting to go on, this IS what it looks like from backstage.

988933,5,6305205787,"Barbara Stanwyck was the leggiest, midrift-showin'est film diva kicking around in the post-Hayes Code thirties and forties.  In the early forties, when the censors were at their heavy-handed meanest, Babs bared her waist in *The Lady Eve,* bared it again in *Ball of Fire,* and bared it again, gloriously, as the headlining stripper in *Lady of Burlesque.* It's almost as if, in Hollywood's golden era of faces, directors thought Babs needed a little help.

Whether she did or not, *Lady of Burlesque* crackles enough in Babs's song-and-dance routines to compensate for whatever the film's flaws, including the grainy picture and criminally poor sound quality. (NOTE: it is **ESSENTIAL** to get a recent DVD transfer--the 2002 is okay--if you want to hear a word.)  Watch closely and you'll catch Babs busting out with moves rarely seen again until the 1980s.

The mystery plot of *Lady of Burlesque* is almost an afterthought: a hackneyed, slangy, and thoroughly charming romp through every dime-novel clich imaginable.  Some old movies you watch because of their enduring significance; others you watch because you're feeling nostalgic.  *Lady of Burlesque* clearly falls into the latter category: it's a two-fold antique that celebrates both 40s Hollywood and the earlier heyday of Burlesque theater.  *Citizen Kane* it ain't, but it's as easy to love as a Sunday trek through a curio shop.",1121817600,4,1424,5.187772925764192

Dixie Daisy is the headliner of the Old Opera House, now a burlesque establishment.  The relative peace and normality of the lives of the performers and crew is disturbed when a series of murders take place.  Both Lolita La Verne (Victoria Faust) and Princess Nirvena (Stephanie Bachelor) are found dead, with their own g-strings wrapped around their necks.

This is camp entertainment at it's best.  Barbara Stanwyck and the ladies of the cast shine like silver, spewing caustic remarks and insults like nobody's business!!  A choice line is ""I'm not staying around here to be strangled by my own beadwork!"".

Burlesque was all but dead by 1942, shut out of most towns and cities by relentless moral crusaders, and Hollywood itself was mired in the infamous ""production code,"" which put a heavy lid on what could and could not be shown on screen.  But burlesque had spawned a number of stars who remained favorites with public, and in 1941 the legendary Gypsy Rose Lee penned a book called THE G-STRING MURDERS.  It proved extremely popular, and a year later United Artists took a chance on the film project.

True enough, the movie couldn't show the strippers in action or play out the bawdy comic sketches so popular in burlesque, but writer James Gunn turned in a superior script, and director William Wellman and his cast gave the whole thing tremendous dash and style.  The result was a movie that captured the seedy, underworld-edged world of burlesque without actually causing censors to yank it from distribution.

In theory, LADY OF BURLESQUE is a murder mystery, but mystery takes a back seat to the brawling backstage antics of crossed love affairs and star rivalry.  Barbara Stanwyck endows star stripper ""Dixie Daisy"" with her own memorable brand of tough class--and although she can only be shown from the waist up when she bumps and grinds, she still manages to tear strips off her musical number ""Play It On The G-String.""  The rest of the cast is equally memorable, many of them burlesque stars in their own right.  Pinky Lee (Mandy) is memorably teamed with Marion Martin (Alice Angle) to delightful effect; Iris Adrian (Gee-Gee)is the gum smacking brash blonde to end all gum smacking brash blondes; and such memorable character actors as Michael O'Shea (Biff), Gloria Dickson (Dolly), and J. Edward Bromberg (Foss) round out the cast superbly.

Sad to say, LADY OF BURLESQUE has fallen into public domain, and it has not been well preserved.  I have seen several releases of the film, and all of them are plagued with breaks in the film and the soundtrack.  This particular DVD release, however, is definitely ""as good as it gets;"" unlike some other versions, the picture is sharp and clear and the sound is extremely good.  LADY OF BURLESQUE may never be regarded as a ""great"" film, but it is an extremely entertaining one, particularly for those who already know something about the now-lost world of burlesque.

989018,3,6305205787,"If no one has already, I'm sure some film studies student somewhere will eventually write a dissertation on sassy, wise-cracking broads as a sign of emerging class consciousness in the American cinema of the 30's and 40's.  Or something like that.  The abundance of B-movies from the era, with tough guys and hard-bitten dames suggested that a good segment of American society identified with (or at least were intrigued by) tough cookies from the wrong side of the tracks--and that as a group, this segment of society was beginning to assert itself.
Where did they all go?  By the 50's, there were still quite a few rough and tumble guys, but sassy, spirited broads were becoming increasingly rare.  Oh sure, you had a few gold diggers around trying to marry millionaires, and that sort of thing.  But worldly wise gals, of the kind one finds in abundance in this 1943 gem, were giving way to housewives and career gals.  The emergence of a solid--if somewhat staid--middle class in post-War America seemed to spell doom for wise-cracking dames with a bit of a history.
So LADY OF BURLESQUE is a peek at another era, both in cinema and society at large.  Ironically, one of the movie's themes is actually a previous social and cultural change--the fall of opera houses of the early 20th century and their re-emergence as burlesque theaters.  To elaborate much more on the topic risks spoiling the murder mystery that is not quite at the center of the film--the milieu itself is its real subject--but suffice to say that in this kind of investigation, it behooves you to look at suspects who are looking back at the past.
The movie has a lot of spirit, a lively cast--and Barbara Stanwyck singing (OK), dancing (pretty good) and giving lots of attitude (no one better).  Other reviewers below have quoted examples of the snappy banter that abounds in this movie.  They're right.

Barbara Stanwyck, the new principal dancer at the Old Opera House, is the primary suspect when two rival dancers are strangled-appropriately involving G-strings. Shes great but doesnt overshadow the rest of the lesser known cast. I won't give away any more, so watch this entertaining glimpse into a too-neglected art form of yesteryear.

I cant recommend any particular print, but the version on the Dangerous Dames Collection is fairly poor.

I cant compare the movie to the novel on which it is based, by the famous Gypsy Rose Lee, but I plan to read it now!",1523923200,,1107,5.207865168539326

7885165,3,6305205787,Another interesting period piece. For Stanwyck fans you get to see another stage in here evolution. Pretty just on the good side of OK,1518652800,,134,4.625
7885166,4,6305205787,Seeing Stanwyck singing and dancing is a bit awkward to watch.  Take it off the E-String and play it on the G String. I'm sure she wasn't happy about it.,1492387200,,153,4.1
7885167,4,6305205787,I liked it a lot. The restored version is better than anything I've seen on youtube.

A really fun movie with a lot of wise cracking, especially from Michael O'Shea. This is probably his best film, at least in my opinion.",1478563200,2,266,4.448979591836735
