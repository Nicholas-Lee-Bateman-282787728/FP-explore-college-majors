7801516,2,1932068414,"At the time I ordered this DVD, it was listed as ""usually ships within 24 hours"".  It took 3 months to arrive and when it did, it would not play on any DVD player, only a computer.  We called the manufacturer, they apologized and got a replacement out promptly after we sent the original to them.  A good 30% of the time is wasted on unnecessary footage and explanations, as if after going to Barcelona and returning they realized they were lacking sufficient good footage so they had pull some stuff back off the editing floor.  The camera work is fine, the voice over dude sounds like Antonio Bandaras, but it fails to  capture the excitement of Barcelona.  The true test of a good travel DVD/video is:  Can you watch it more than once and still get enjoyment out of it.  This one fails the test miserably; by the third viewing you absolutely hate it.  The footage used to stretch the time is irrelevant and banal. This is definitely not a DVD to remind you of being in BCN.  My recommendation is to pass on this, it is very disappointing at $29.95.",1088812800,26,1051,4.427083333333333
