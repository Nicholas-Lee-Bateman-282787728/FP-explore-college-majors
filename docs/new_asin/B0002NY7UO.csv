2107454,5,B0002NY7UO,"I love the RAMONES, so I felt like I had to write a review for this awesome DVD. The previous reviews describe the video perfectly, so I won't go into it again. It's simply AWESOME!!! the best RAMONES' video I've seen. A MUST HAVE for RAMONES fans all over the world.

Something else that is not mentioned on the previous reviews and I thought was really cool is the fact that DeeDee appears on the video quite a bit! (nothing against CJ, but DeeDee was THE MAN!) there's even a clip of his ""rapper"" days!! how great is that?!?

The live footage in Italy and Finland are the best!!!!!!!!! it also has a lot of footage of us crazy South Americans flipping out over our favorite band (like on the other videos, but this one has more of that :-).

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",1096502400,5,767,4.387323943661972
2107455,5,B0002NY7UO,"Addendum:

Look, all I can tell you all is that I own everything the Ramones ever put out on vinyl, VHS and disc and I've watch and rewatched this DVD 8 times already. I too cannot get ""I Can't Make It On Time"" out of my head. I wish Sire would release ""End Of The Century - Naked"". It's so obvious after seeing the ""I Ramones"" footage how Phil Spector watered down that album. The Italy concert footage is amazing. Not one of their better shows? C'Mon now! The sound check alone will blow you away. The majority of the DVD is not on ""Around The World"". Yes, some stuff is, but it's been given different editing which frankly I found amusing. This disc wasn't made for the casual fan; it was made for the die hard fans to enjoy. All the little stuff that the casual fan might find boring is pretty fun for us die hard fans to get to see.

My original review:

I don't usually write reviews, but this time I felt I had to.  First off, I've seen the Ramones live 40 times.  So you can trust I know the band.  Thus don't take it lightly when I say that this is the best video release I have seen from or about the Ramones yet.  That includes all the legitimate and bootleg stuff out there on VHS and DVD and even ""End Of The Century"" (though that was great too).

By the title, I expected a ""raw"" bunch of clips loosely strung together.  The footage is raw home movie footage, though not at all amateurish.  The scripting and production around the footage simply blew me away.  It was thoroughly entertaining.  It's a movie; not just some random raw footage.

The ""I Ramones"" footage from Italy was amazing to see.  It was like watching the concert scene from ""Rock `N' Roll High School"".  The biggest thrill for me was seeing ""I Can't Make It On Time"" played live and without all the Phil Spector production (complete with Johnny playing some lead parts).  The volleyball scene was a howl, as was the rest of bit with ""Gilbert Ramone"".  There's some footage you've may have seen before if you're a die-hard fan, though it's been given a new twist (I won't say more so as not to spoil it for you).

This DVD captures the Ramones at their best, both musically as a band and with each other as people.  If you like the Ramones at all, purchasing this DVD is a no-brainer.  I'm going to buy 3 more today for my friends.

Marky, thank you so much for making this DVD for us.  With the deaths of Joey and Dee Dee and the recent passing 2 weeks ago of Johnny, I was in serious need of a catharsis.  Your DVD gave me that and more.  It reminded me of why I love you guys so much.  The Ramones were and are a bunch of cool people, real and genuine, never pretentious.  I owe so much of who I am to your inspiration.

2107467,4,B0002NY7UO,"I remember when Punk Rock first appeared. It was almost universally condemned in the press. America's and England's musical culture had taken a turn for the worse, or so the stories went. Well, I just didn't care and took no interest in it. Then in 1978, an article came out in the Wall Street Journal, of all places, talking about the new music that was appearing and the article featured Devo and Talking Heads, two of the more unusual new bands. These weren't Punk bands but belonged in a closely related genre known as New Wave. I bought an album of each of the mentioned bands and really, really liked the music. As such, I began buying up other New Wave albums and had a clerk at Tower Records acting as my advisor. One day he showed me the ""End of the Century"" album by the Ramones and assured me that I'd like it. Wait a minute here. These guys didn't wear narrow ties and have short hair. They wore black leather jackets and had jeans with holes abraded in them and had long dark hair. They didn't look at all like gentlemen rockers, They looked like hooligans and druggies. The clerk assured me that I'd love the music, and I did.

Well, that was the beginnings of me and the Ramones. I also bought their ""Road to Ruin"" album and one other that I just can't seem to find anymore. At about the same time, I started going to ""The Skeleton Club,"" a local Punk Rock place in the poorer part of the downtown district. It was interesting and fun. They'd feature three bands a night and most of them looked like they'd fit right in with the Ramones. In the audience there were ""ladies"" who wore dog collars and and had crew cuts and a lot of the guys had black leather jackets and heavy boots and looked tough as nails. Well, they were just young people dancing and having a good time. Oh, there were occasional fist fights between band members and guys on the dance floor, but most of that just amounted to foul language and some pushing and shoving around. I specifically remember one night. The place didn't have air conditioning and it became so sweltering inside that they opened the doors and let the crowd out to get a bit of fresh air. A cop drove by and saw about 50-75 of the punks out in the street. He immediately stopped and called for reinforcements. In a matter of minutes, we were surrounded by four police cars all shining their lights on us. One guy was on the mic and declared us an unlawful assembly and said if we didn't get back inside we would be arrested. Ah, yes. The early Punk scene.

In any case, the Ramones were directly or indirectly behind all this, although they never  received nearly enough credit. Just recently, I picked up the ""Ramones Raw"" DVD and relived a bit of this very interesting part of rock history. The DVD features the Ramones, of course, and Raw is a meaningful part of the title.  It's not a story. It's not a concert. It has no readily apparent organization. It's not in chronologic order. It's just a hodge-podge of stuff put together around the Ramones and their constant touring. The whole thing makes for fascinating viewing and there's many excellent bits of the Ramones going trough their songs. I suppose the thing has some structure to it because it holds the attention, but the structure isn't apparent to me. If you're wondering what it might be like to be a popular Punk band, then this DVD is a good start. If you've ever wondered what the Ramones were like as individual persons, this is excellent. If you've heard about the Ramones being as popular in South America as the Beatles, this is the place to see it. In short, if you're really interested in Punk Rock and the Ramones (the founding fathers of Punk), this is a fine DVD.

Well, If you aren't all that interested in Punk and in the Ramones, then it wouldn't make all that good of a watch. If you don't like Ramones music, then why would you be reading this? If you had no previous knowledge, then this might be a simply awful movie. If you aleady have a good background, then it's a fascination.

2107468,2,B0002NY7UO,"RAMONES RAW: Second RAMONES beatkeeper MARKY RAMONE's disorienting hodge-podge of home movies from the road, rapid fire live clips, and kitschy TV appearances pales compared to the more cohesive, definitive documentary END OF THE CENTURY. RAW provides no insight into the band's humble climb to punk rock immortality or messy non-speaking relationship between JOEY and JOHNNY; however, numerous foreign fan riots and shots of various band members on the toilet prevail. Peak period concert footage of a 1980 Italian soundcheck and tongue in cheek guest shots the group made on SPACE GHOST: COAST TO COAST and THE UNCLE FLOYD SHOW make up the majority of redeeming footage. The choppy hotel clips and ""sloth"" jokes are repetitious and seemingly endless. The so-called ""guest shots""...DREW BARRYMORE, AL ""GRANDPA MUNSTER"" LEWIS, THE DOORS' ROBBY KREIGER...are brief and superficial, while UP ALL NIGHT's host GILBERT GODFRIED (as ""the fifth RAMONE"") does his usual unfunny ""look at how incredibly annoying I am"" schtick. In spite of the proclaimed ""five hours of rare material"" in RAW's liner notes, less than 60 minutes is worth a gander. Entertaining, short 'n sweet, like the band's classic ditties, should have been the rule here. Hey Ho Hum...

2107476,4,B0002NY7UO,"to me, end of the century was good, but it lacked a lot when someone like myself was dying to know more about the years after the ""end of the century"" album.

that is where ramones raw kicks in. first, i will say, this for someone who is definately a Ramones fanatic.  someone who is fascinated, loves, or wants to know more about the deceased members of the Ramones. if the Ramones, to you, are just ""the band that made blitzkrieg bop and i wanna be sedated,"" you may want to just rent end of the century or read facts and bios about them on websites.  however, if you live and breath ramones, are sick of hearing about the formation of the band and the early years for the 20,000th time, listen to multiple albums of theirs daily, and love every album ramones-adios amigos, then this is a must have!  also, there is some nice commentary from johnny ramone on this!

if you have seen/own end of the century, but felt it lacked too much coverage of the band's later years, this is the dvd for you. yes, this dvd is more of a slice of life compilation of video goof-offs, commercials, and other interesting things the Ramones encountered while on the road(mostly during the brain drain and mondo bizarro eras.), but it does do its job in revealing those relatively unknown years of the band to some youngster like myself.  my only gripe is that it weren't longer! it made me want to see more Ramone antics.",1169856000,2,1405,4.426356589147287
2107477,4,B0002NY7UO,"""Ramones Raw"" is a documentary that a combination of live performances through out the years, a very good range of various years, and the band members filming each other...which is hilarious now and then.  Marky is usually the one filming, but it's really great to see the LEGENDS, like JOHNNY, JOEY, and DEE DEE just being themselves.

A couple highlights of the film include a true vintage performance in Italy...a really beautiful setting combined with the Ramones' performance of one of their hit songs (can't think of it right now, sorry).  There is also a comical segment with Gilbert Godfrey trying to get into the Ramones, claiming he is one of them.  It's hilarious really-they go golfing and lock him in a closet...good times.

Even the littler scenes with Dee Dee begging for someone's credit card (ah what a journey) and him drinking coffee in Valencia are just really heartwarming, because that was Dee Dee just doing what he does.

Joey and Johnny of course, were more on the quiet side, but Marky does get some pretty good shots of them eating or joking around...this movie is really the Ramones ""raw.""

I recommend it to even the slightest fans, for you will see what that band really was, during their candid moments of course.  It is enjoyable for all ages of all types of people that have a place in their hearts for the Ramones.  Long live the Ramones!",1153785600,,1372,4.707112970711297
2107478,2,B0002NY7UO,"Ramones Raw is basically Marky Ramone with a handheld camera annoying Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee and C.J. while on tour. There is some great live footage of the band playing some classic songs. The DVD doesn't really tell a story but is more of a narrative of the Ramones life on the road. The inner relations of the band are not touched upon at all. In fact, by watching Ramones Raw you'd never know that Johnny and Joey hated each other with a passion. Most of the running time is lighthearted gags and inside jokes interspersed with concert footage. For a complete look at the inner workings of the band, as well as the making of most of their albums, pick up the End of the Century DVD it is a MUCH more comprehensive look at the band as a whole.

2107480,4,B0002NY7UO,"Before I put Ramones Raw in the DVD player I thought it might seem bittersweet to watch, what with three of the band members now deceased. But instead of making me feel sad, the footage only made me happy that the world ever got to experience this thing called Ramones in the first place.

The DVD contains five hours' worth of footage, including concert footage from 1980 to 1996, clips of television appearances (Howard Stern and Uncle Floyd), their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and ""I, Ramones,"" a concert shot in Italy.

With exception to concert footage, most of what we see was shot by Marky Ramone on his Super 8 camera. Apparently Marky was determined to capture life on the road for the band and it is his behind-the-scenes footage that makes this DVD worthwhile. The title is appropriate as some of what you see is indeed raw, and it gets a bit confusing at times because things aren't in chronological order.

Some of the more interesting footage includes the band's van being mobbed by screaming and fanatical fans much like the Beatles in ""A Hard Day's Night,"" and Johnny sarcastically giving tour manager Monte Melnick a hard time anytime things get chaotic: ""Really well organized, Monte. Nice job."" Not.

We also get to see the usually stoic Johnny actually laugh and joke as well as sobering evidence of Dee Dee's physical and mental decline from drug use as we see clips of a youthful and vibrant Dee Dee and a hardened and somewhat narcissistic one. There are also lots of shots of the boys sitting on the toilet, which they themselves find hilarious.

Joey appears to be an easy-going, laid back guy who gets along well with everyone. But the footage suggests, as has been reported since Johnny's death, that he and Johnny did not get along very well after Johnny stole his girlfriend. We don't see the two fight or bicker. Instead, they simply and quietly avoid each other.

Diehard fans of  Joey, Johnny, Marky and Dee Dee won't be disappointed with this one. It's a lively snapshot into the life of four ordinary guys whose impact on music was anything but ordinary.",1113264000,33,2107,4.678378378378379

My favorite part is the concert shot in Italy in 1980, along with the Uncle Floyd segments.  I love the part where they perform ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" even if they are lipsynching, and I also loved the clip from ""Rock'n'Roll High School,"" when they play ""Do You Wanna Dance.""

The backstage footage is interesting, although a lot of it consists of inside jokes that only the band understands.

Now that three of the four original Ramones are gone, I'd highly recommend getting this DVD, so you can see the magic over and over again.",1109116800,7,637,4.4655172413793105

I am talking about the Italian concert that, as others have noted, is the best reason to own this DVD.  My husband, who didn't know the Ramones music (oy), walked in while this was playing -- he stopped, listened, and said, ""Wow, they didn't suck!""  Indeed they didn't, and this proves it for all time, in case you needed it proved.  I can't get ""I Can't Make It on Time"" outta my head either!  It's like discovering a new Ramones song (even tho I had ""End of the Century"" when it first came out, I guess I must have forgotten this one).  I have probably watched this DVD 20 times since I got it in January, and it woulda been more but I was out of town.  That concert footage is such a thing of beauty.  And it is cool to hear Johnny Ramone talk, and even to see them goofing around (altho once or twice is enough).

2107485,4,B0002NY7UO,"I've seen reviews here and elsewhere that complain that ""Ramones Raw"" is strictly for Ramones fans. Well, as we used to say in junior high, no duh, Sherlock. Of COURSE it's for Ramones fans! Yes, the bulk of the material consists of Marky Ramone's home videos, shot on the road. And, no, this is not an in-depth documentary (such as ""End of the Century"") that explores the history and impact of the Ramones. But what it IS is a glimpse into the everyday life of the band that singlehandedly re-invented rock-n-roll. It's a peek into the dressing room before showtime, a ride in the van. It's an all-access pass to hang with the Ramones from concert stages in Europe and South America to the airports, highways and Holiday Inns they called home for twenty-plus years.

In showing the band in its everyday life, ""Raw"" even calls into question certain impressions one might get from viewing only ""End of the Century."" To watch 'EOTC,' you'd think that these guys never actually enjoyed being Ramones even for a minute. But ""Raw"" shows them hanging out, joking around, goofing off...just acting like bandmates. You may get a sense of the rift between Johnny and Joey, but the rest of the lads seem to get on just fine.

Of course, in addition to the home movies, ""Raw"" sports some pretty amazing concert footage of the Ramones at their peak, GREAT commentary by Johnny and Marky (you've never heard either of them talk this much anywhere else) and clips from various TV appearances over the years. For Ramones fans only? Probably so...but it's a look at the band that any true fan is going to love.",1107475200,2,1594,4.669039145907473

SE CONSIDERA QUE LOS RAMONES SON OTRO GRAN GRUPO, TAN BUENOS, TAN FAMOSOS Y ADORADOS COMO LOS BEATLES.",1105747200,,1152,4.683168316831683
2107487,5,B0002NY7UO,"Okay, most of you goons that ""reviewed"" this DVD could pass muster as true Ramones fans, but the rest of ya make me wanna fart rather loudly and oh so stinky!

A guy I was talking to about ""music"" the other day told me, although he thinks the Ramones are ""crap"", the interesting thing, he noticed, was that old time Ramones fans basically ONLY listened to the Ramones.  The jerk-off I'm talking about was nothing other than a sleepy eyed, drug infested ""Dead Head"" , who can at least understand musical fidelity to ones favorite band.  And he's right!  I ONLY listened to the Ramones, although I could tolerate a little bit o' Black Flag, Social Distortion, M.D.C., old Bad Religion, Husker Du, Christ On Parade, etc.  But it started and ended with the Ramones, period.

This DVD, yes, DOES consist mostly of Marky's 8MM films, as well as stuff from ""We're Outta Here"".  However, as someone else in this ""review"" thread so astutely observed; this DVD has more talking from Johnny than I have ever seen, and that's saying someting, man!  The fact that Marky co-produced ""Raw"" is kinda par for the course.  Anybody who saw the old ""Lifestyles of the Ramones"" VHS tape will remember that a lot of the ""footage"" between videos was Marky's films.  And to the yn-yang who ""couldn't finish"" watching the Raw DVD because ""Joey was standing too far away from Johnny""; DUH!!  The Ramones were a PUNK ROCK BAND!!  There wasn't SUPPOSED to be an atmosphere of ""love, peace, and everything"" with these guys; they began to hate each other when it became evident that the Ramones were never going to catch a break and get the commercial success that they deserved.  Joey wanted to be a bubblegum band, as is evidenced by almost every song he ever wrote for the Ramones, Johnny, after realizing it was never going to happen financially for the Ramones felt loyalty to the die-hard fans (he never wanted to ""sell out"" and make albums like ""End of the Century""), and Marky, well, Marky was pretty much d.o.a. drunk most of the time, pulling his pants down at recording sessions and exposing his bare ass to the band in all of its hairy glory!

Marky is generally seen as ""the Ramones"" drummer, and I guess he really was, but Tommy was the original genius behind the image and sound of the Ramones.  Ritchie, of course, was a very goo punnk rock drummer (and a damn good songwriter, as ""Humankind"" off of Too Tough To Die, ""Smash You"" off of the T.T.T.D. reissue bonus tracks, and the immortal ""Somebody Put Something In My Drink"", off of the Animal Boy album) who became a ""rock star"" and demanded, via his wifes instigation, $500 a show or he was going to quit the band.  So, Johnny said ""he man, quit""!  Then they got Clem Burke from Blondie to play drums, albiet only for four shows.  Clem dubbed himself as ""Elvis"" Ramone.  Well, then a sober and apologetic Marky rejoined the band, and there you have it; Brain Drain was released (arguably the best post ""Too Tough To Die"" Ramones album.

The Italian show was great, especially the performance of ""I Can't Make It On Time"", which, quite frankly, I never saw the Ramones play live, and I saw the Ramones a verifiable 39 times between 1978-1993.

Yes, the discs have a lot of filler, and yes, this actually should have been a one disc set, but hey, in TRUE Ramones fashion, you get two dvds for the price of one!

GABBA GABBA HEY!",1104537600,3,3365,4.554817275747508
2107495,3,B0002NY7UO,"i am a huge ramones fan. my sister is safekeeping my ramones vinyl collection. this is almost sacreligous to say as johnny has just passed away but who wants to watch somebody else's home videos?
can we say boring to the tune of gabba gabba hey?

the band was best captured on film in rock n roll high school.

just watch the interaction between the band and it will give you goosebumps. joey stays away from johnny the whole time.

i couldn't even finnish this dvd. i'll wait for the end of the century to come out.
sorry johnny. it just didn't get my attention.",1102291200,2,563,4.3428571428571425
2107496,2,B0002NY7UO,"When I saw this DVD I thought, due to packaging similiarities, it was the ""End Of The Century"" movie that was being released to theatres at the same time. That was a good movie.

""Raw"" is mostly dull home video (actually, road video) footage. I had a hard time watching that all the way through -- how many shots of Ramones on the toilet, looking into the camera do you need? The concert in Italy is worth seeing. The rest of the live footage documents the extent of their decline as a live band -- even at ever-increasing beats per minute, it's no fun to watch them go thru the motions. There's also some almost dada Uncle Floyd, and starved-for-rock Brazilian rioters. All in all, maybe 30 minutes of good stuff; the rest is sad, numbing tedium you'll wanna skip over.

Soundcheck for the Italian show is in the main program -- a half dozen Italians not dressed as punks lounge in the sunny audience area while the Ramones rock the rock. That was kinda cool. The actual concert is in the bonus features. The band, while no longer in their brilliant early period, are still young & healthy. The show occurs on a green in front of what looks like a castle, sweet place for a medium sized outdoor concert. A great day to be a Ramone.

Fans should rent ""Raw"" for the concert. Non-fans should still see ""End Of The Century"", a swell documentary that should please anyone with even a tolerance for rock'n'roll.",1101600000,5,1406,4.484375
2107497,5,B0002NY7UO,"Ramones Raw is the best DVD on a band out there. It has everything you need about the Ramones. Live performances, documentary, TV appearances and a whole lot of more stuff. Anything you need about the Ramones is right here in this DVD.  I don't know how any true Ramones fan can't be satisfy by this DVD.  With Marky as camera-man anything can go on. The thing that I would like to point out is how funny the ""easter egg"" scheme is. I found all twelve and there all a bunch of the Ramones just saying one word than it's done. If you would add all the easter eggs together it would probably be a minute and a half (just like a Ramones song). To access the easter egg just to go one title of the menu and press the right or left arrow on your DVD controller. The T.V. appearances show the Ramones on the ""Uncle Floyd Show"" (interview, a clip from Rock 'n' Roll high school, and Ramones performing ""I just want to have something to do"", it sounds like a voice over though), the Ramones on the howard stern summer show (very funny, howard points out how him and Joey could be twins), Ramones on ""Space Ghost Coast to Coast"", ""interview with Joey on MTV's 120 minutes"", and ""USA's Up All Night with Gilbert Gottfried"". The live performance from Italy in 1980 is an amazing show. It's just that in the program they name the songs wrong. It would have better if it were longer than 27 minutes. If it were an hour it would have been better. They could have picked a better show though. The commentary with Marky, Johnny, and John Cafiero is quite funny. If you are a true Ramones fan, you will not be disappointed by this DVD. Everything you need about a band is right here on one DVD. Live performances, a documentary, commentary, interviews all the things you need to see about the Ramones. I don't understand how anyone can give this DVD less than 5 stars. If Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee were still alive I'm sure they would agree that this DVD tells it as it is.",1101081600,4,1956,4.3125
2107498,3,B0002NY7UO,"If you love the Ramones in all their ragged glory, then RAW will suit you fine. Just make sure you understand that the emphasis here in on the ragged. Culled mostly from Marky Ramone's (also serving as the executive producer) collection of home super eight's, RAW combines extensive footage of the band as they traveled the world. The material is also not presented chronolgically, and that can get jarring. At times, these low-fi bits get tedious, best serving as bridges between the really good stuff. Of which there is plenty. You get to see clips from (mostly European and South American) concerts, TV clips and the band as they accept a gold disc award.

Oddly enough, the true high points of RAW are in the bonus materials, the 30 minute ""I Ramone"" concert sequence in particular.  The ""Up All Night"" and ""Space Ghost"" segments are cool too. But frankly, if you are only curious about the Ramones and want to pick up some home viewing, my advice is to hold out for the superior ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/End-of-the-Century-The-Story-of-the-Ramones/dp/B000642JG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">End of the Century - The Story of the Ramones</a>,"" the warts and all 2004 documentary.",1100131200,19,1227,5.352331606217617
2107499,5,B0002NY7UO,"I can't believe people are being so picky about this DVD.  Though some of this footage might have been released before, this is probably the only way you will see it on DVD.  Everything looks and sounds outstanding in my opinion.  I can't believe anyone would complain because it looks too nice.  The best part is it's a very good price.  I expected it to be in the $30 (canadian) price range when it was released so I was quite happy when I saw how cheap it is.  I enjoyed watching it a ton, and will watch it many more times.",1099267200,,527,4.1683168316831685
2107500,5,B0002NY7UO,"I don't know what DVD ""Jonathan"" was watching, but compared to the crappy ""Ramones Around the World"",  RAW is the definitive DVD to own.  This guy has no idea what he is talking about.  It has TON'S of new material!!!! Besides the INCREDIBLE Italy footage, it also contains the Ramones appearances on theHOWARD STERN SHOW from the  WOR TV series, the USA UP ALL NIGHT APPEARANCES, as well as the weirdest assortment of celebrity appearances that I never even knew about. Their appearances on the UNCLE FLOYD  show are worth the 15 dollars alone. NEVER BEFORE SEEN MUSIC VIDEO for ""TOURING"", File footage of Dee Ramone and his RAP CAREER! And file footage from New York, when Joey Ramone died, including when the city of NEW YORK named a street after him.  There is too much material to count. ALSO, it does not say it contains `FIVE HOURS OF FOOTAGE. It says it contains FIVE HOURS OF MATERIAL! That includes audio commentaries, easter eggs, and tons of bonus stuff.

The Italian concert is shown during the main program.  It is shown in it's entirety as a  bonus feature, without interruption and  FOUR EXTRA SONGS that are NOT in the main program.  The Songs are:

Commando, I Want To Be Sedated, Gimme, Gimme Shock Treatment and Lets Go!

Get it Straight if your gonna do a review!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GREAT DVD!!!!!",1097798400,8,1324,4.650862068965517
2107501,5,B0002NY7UO,"If your a Ramones fan, then you have to buy this DVD. Its worth the price just for the live concert. You will watch it again and again. !!!!",1097452800,2,140,3.8620689655172415
2107502,1,B0002NY7UO,"This is a slickly edited and completely processed revision of footage available on the far superior RAMONES AROUND THE WORLD VHS tape; all the footage was shot by Marky Ramone and his crew as video Super 8mm documents of their tours. RAW offers pretty much the same footage, but with ""slicker"" editing that ruins the roughness of the original footage, and offers many snippets as ""deleted scenes"" which can be seen in their entirety on the RAMONES AROUND THE WORLD tape. The tape is rough, poorly edited, but conveys (as much as possible) the genuine power of a Ramones concert, intercut with the hassles of endless touring, gold record awards, talking to out-of-it journalists, and the infamous ""van attack"" sequence. The only new material here is the concert in Italy, shot on film by RAI, and offered here twice (which strikes me a cheating); once in the RAW disc itself, as part of the program; and once as a stand-alone document of the concert. Unfortunately, it's not one of their better gigs. My strong recommendation: get RAMONES AROUND THE WORLD on VHS before it goes out of print, and skip this. It's really a rip.",1097452800,6,1124,4.769230769230769
2107503,4,B0002NY7UO,"Ramones Raw is a good little peek at the Ramones on the road.  Now, some of this footage was seen on ""We're Outta Here"", but Marky Ramone and his High-8 camera has captured a lot of good stuff here.  I never saw Johnny talk so much!!!!  One thing this video does do, is shatter the myth that the bruddas hated each other.  They are seen actually having fun with each other here, so all couldn't have been bad.  The footage from Uncle Floyd and Up All Night is good stuff for those who missed it the first time around.  And I have no idea why another reviewer trashed the ""I Ramones"" live performance, because it is top shelf!  Filmed in 1980, it has the Ramones still at the top of their game.  The tunes performed here you've heard before, but perhaps not played as passionately.  However, most fans have not heard ""I Can't Make It On Time"" from End of the Century performed live, and you get it here!  Very nicely done, and I bought this DVD four days ago, and I still have the tune going through my head.  This despite having known the song for 24 years!

Some negatives- This dvd is very heavily Marky centered, mainly because he's the man responsible for a large part of the footage, and he's also the exec. producer.  Tommy is there and C.Jay is there, but Ritchie Ramone is not mentioned or seen.  He has been officially ""whacked"" by the Ramones.  There is one clip where Ritchie would have been playing, but there's no shots of him on tape.  Not a big deal, but interesting.

Also, this DVD comes billed as having over 5 hours of footage.  Not quite....While it's all good stuff, the bonus section contains the 1/2 hour ""I Ramones"" concert, which with the exception of, I believe, one song, is cut into the full length documentary anyway.  I suppose you can argue that you get the full program uninterrupted in the bonus section, but you're not seeing anything new.

Good DVD, and it also makes you a bit sad to see the boys there and knowing that three of them are gone now.  I recommend it!",1097366400,4,2000,4.380434782608695
2107504,2,B0002NY7UO,"This is not a review of the Ramones, who are for, all purposes, one of the greatest bands of all time. But ""Ramones Raw"", the first officially issued Ramones DVD, feels like patchwork.

Composed mostly of behind the scenes footage of the last eight years of the Ramones, ""Ramones: Raw"" tries to tell the story of the band from its beginning to its end in the mid ninties. And for the most part it fails.

If you had never heard the Ramones and wathced this DVD, you would probably wonder what all the fuss was about. The behind-the-scenes stuff is so unrelentingly boring I'd be really suprised if anyone but the most die hard fans would want to watch it twice. Even they may not want to.

And the live clips that pepper the film and serve to move the documentary are some of the sloppiest, poorest quality Ramomes live footage this side of a bootleg shot by an epilpetic parapalegic. The sound muddies up the songs to a point where you can hardly even hear it. Some will say that this is ""charming"". I say its just plain lazy.

Also included on the DVD are some bonus features that aren't really bonuses. All the extras that are taken from T.V. shows feel as if they were put on this DVD from an aging VHS copy somebody owned, and with the exception of an intersting bit taekn from MTV's ""120 Minutes"" do little to help show the Ramones legacy in the way the recent ""End of the Century"" documentary did.

The editing is choppy and the whole 105 minute program is just unforgivably boring, which is all the more sad since the band in question is the Ramones. They deserve better than this hackwork job, and so does the viewer.

For a group who never seemed to get the recognition or fame they deserved, seeing this just makes that mystery greater. And what I really like about this is that despite the tension between bandmates that was well-known, these guys were professionals who took the work seriously and made things work for the benefit of the music and the fans. I have a lot of respect for them on that level. I was unaware that they toured for so many years without many breaks and how the fans responded to them in various places around the world.

8029669,5,B0002NY7UO,"A Ramones fan since 75! saw them a zillion times each time they kicked butt. No band was ever as original and wrote so many hits that
never became hits until Green Day and other bands stole their songs and sound! They should have been bigger than Zep or Stones etc.
This is such a great treat with backstage footage and videos of them touring and the best is the live concert in Italy from 1981 End of
the Century tour! too bad the entire show isn't available. Joey Ramone had one of the best voices in rock history! While Johnny wasn't
the greatest technically player he created a sound that nobody else can duplicate. Mark and Tommy was two of the most original and
best drummers in rock history! Dee Dee while not a great bassist was a great songwriter and had great stage presence. The Ramones
should have had 1,000 hits and sold millions! shame on radio and snob critics who ignored them and put them down. They still got
in the rock n roll hall of fame if that means anything since the rock hall of fame is a bunch of snobby stupid hippies! HEY HO LET'S GO!",1486598400,,1063,4.293532338308458
8029670,5,B0002NY7UO,"Great behind the scenes footage of the band traveling and hanging out. I think it actually makes them seem quite normal compared to the image of The Ramones. They certainly put in the hours. Toured almost continuously til the very end. 35 years of rocking out around the world is pretty impressive. It might be nice to have more concert footage but that's not what this video is about. I'd recommend it for the longtime fan who wants everything Ramone, and for the newbie who wants to get a feel for the individuals in the band. Very nice.",1477872000,,539,4.510204081632653
