Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks so you can bathe in the full splendor of this epic film.  ""Kingdom of Heaven"" only told part of the story, and not nearly as well:  This film is also about the birth of a nation called Sweden.",1286668800,,320,4.283333333333333
3623671,4,B001H606S2,"1 Disc Widescreen, being released October 12, 2010

""Arn the Knight Templar"" was directed by Peter Flinth in 2007 and stars Joakim Ntterqvist as Arn Magnusson who has been trained from the age of a young boy to become an expert swordsman and after being double-crossed by a nobleman is made into a Knight Templar and sent to the Crusades. In the process of fighting to regain his freedom, he battles in the war and becomes a ""hero.""

The beauty of a big budget film like this about the Crusades being made in Sweden is that the languages spoken in it are English, Swedish, Arabic, French, AND Latin -- not just English like it would be in America. It does a great deal more to authenticate the time period. There's just something so romantic about knights, chivalry, the costumes, the architecture, the nuns -- wait a second, the nuns?

Since the Crusades actually were a dark time in history and not at all heroic like history books originally made them out to be, the church's darker side comes out as well. Arn was supposed to be a monk and his romantic interest, Cecilia was supposed to be a nun and the two are split apart after being found out and made example of. Arn gets to be a knight instead of a monk since he happens to be good with a sword, but he's a HOLY knight so that should make ALL the difference. Cecilia is thrown back into the nunnery where women are punished with lashes from a whip until blood is drawn for speaking. Scenes inside churches are more gruesome than ON the battlefield for the majority of the film.

Joakim Ntterqvist as the lead goes against type because when he is young and clean shaven, he just looks kind of goofy, immature, and short so nothing like a future hero. He gets more realistic street cred after growing his beard, but I never believe him as anything other than a guy who would get lost in the ranks. He is ""Russell Crow-ed"" up a bit on the cover, but he looks nothing like that during the film. It is played like he is supposed to be Aragorn from Lord of the Rings, but he is no Viggo Mortensen. Sofia Helin plays Cecilia Algotsdotter who is brought up as a nun-in-training, falls in love, then is practically imprisoned back in the church by the other nuns. Nuns are evil in this and the Mother Superior type character goes so far as admitting she wanted to ""crush the happiness"" shared by Cecelia and Arn. When Cecelia finds herself unable to forgive the woman who not only crushed her happiness but stole her child away from her, the woman freaks out and attempts to curse her!

The costuming, sets, props, and accurate language really adds something special to this film and the whole thing has a big-budget feel typical of our American films but unique in Sweden. The lighting out in the desert is pretty fantastic as well. There is an overlying theme of obedience to one's elders, church, and country. It is pretty hard to keep up with when everyone seems out to get the two main characters who seem perfectly willing to serve their penance and when they do, they get it taken away from them again by jealous people in power. When the battle is truly underway, it feels like ""Braveheart"" but instead of being ""FOR FREEDOM!!!"", it's ""For Norway!""

This movie is based on a series of historical fiction books by Jan Guillou and in 2008, a follow-up movie came out called ""Arn: The Kingdom at Road's End."" A three-part series of novels was made into 2 feature-length films and were the most expensive films made in Sweden's history. It feels like every big budget film period film you've seen in America, but it's from Sweden. It's still well done, but I don't care for the story. The Crusades were a dark point in history, not to be romanticized. As soon as I learned about the Crusades in school, I had to ask, ""why is our mascot The Crusader??? There's nothing good about that story!"" It is one of many doomed holy wars and we often forget its association with the story of Robin Hood. A bunch of people thinking they are off to do good when they aren't. Clearly everyone in power was vilified in this film, but our leads were made out to be martyrs doing the time for their crime in a saintly manner and I just was not feeling it.

Special Features:

There are two bonus featurettes of the making of the film subtitled in english with a running time of approximately 40 minutes total. It feels like the making of every epic period film you've ever seen before...the difference is that this was made in Sweden where they do not have a vast history of epic big-budget films to draw from so it all is pretty new to them. They are clearly very proud of what was accomplished in this film, but I have to say...I really don't get films about the Crusades.",1286582400,6,4711,4.4570765661252905

This is a Region 2 DVD.  But it's such a great movie that it's worth the extra cost of buying a region-free DVD Player.  If you don't already own one, get one so you can watch this great movie.

No English subtitles, though.

Here's my product review (in English and Swedish):

(English)
Arn, the son of a high-ranking Swedish nobleman is educated in a monastery and sent to the Holy Land as a knight templar to do penance for a forbidden love.

(Swedish)
Historien om Arn och Cecilia utspelar sig i Sverige och Det Heliga Landet med ett rikt galleri av modiga riddare, mktiga drottningar och svekfulla kungar. Det r en berttelse om krig och intriger, vnskap och svek, men ocks en berttelse om stor krlek.

r 1150 fds Arn Magnusson p Arns grd i Vstra Gtaland. Han uppfostras i kloster och blir en bildad ung man och en skicklig krigare. I Cecilia mter han den stora krleken, en krlek som gr dem till offer fr striden mellan den andliga och vrldsliga makten. Cecilia sprras in i kloster och Arn skickas som tempelriddare till Det Heliga Landet dr kriget rasar mellan kristna och muslimer. Nr Arn tervnder hem mste han kmpa fr sin krlek och det som har blivit hans livsml: att ena Sverige till ett enda rike.",1243555200,7,1262,4.598214285714286
3623694,5,B001H606S2,"an impressive work.  i have no idea how much was historically accurate, but it was very believable.  the actors seemed to be speaking their local languages throughout the film, replaced at each transition with quality dubbing.  the battle scenes were realistic (although i would have waited to see if the svarks (sp??) and Danes would have been stupid enough to charge again ).

other comments suggest that this is an abbreviated version of the original; if so, it was an epic job",1522540800,,480,4.817073170731708

This is just a small part, but important to the understanding of holding on to beliefs and tradition.  This is the story of how Sweden was on it's way to becoming it on country by surviving the invasions of indigenous tribes and at the same time telling of why the crusades were so important.

It was an enjoyable movie from the first time I watched it (this will be a go-to film for me now, to watch again and again).

3623749,4,B001H606S2,"I read the trilogy of novels by Jan Guillou which this is based on first.  This was originally broadcast as a miniseries on Swedish TV, I think (and the miniseries version used to be available on YouTube), and the theatrical film here is cut down from that, with what was kept of scenes from Arn & Cecilia's youths used as flashbacks.  Mr. Guillou also wrote a 4th volume, ""Arvet efter Arn"" (never yet translated to English, AFAIK), in which a grandson of the fictional Arn & Cecilia (possibly via a son other than Magnus Maaneskold, whom we met in this movie) grows up to become the real-life founder of the city of Stockholm.  (I've got the Swedish original and a good dictionary, but my Swedish has gotten a bit rusty since my college years, and it would take a LONG time for me to read an entire novel in Swedish nowadays.)
Anyway, the movie itself is good, if a bit overly compressed, and hopefully those who'd like to understand a bit more about the real-life events of the Crusades or medieval Swedish history will at least read Mr. Guillou's novel trilogy, and perhaps find some history books about the period as well.",1518912000,7,1126,4.564356435643564

Often times there is so much dialogue with a foreign film it is hard to watch. Not the case here.

There is also a very neat device where the same scene changes somewhat to show what the principal actor feels as a person acting alone, and also how he feels the pressure of those also present.

The plot is straightforwardly simple but there is a great richness of detail in the scenes. Also, there is an absence of stereotypes despite the time and topic.",1516924800,8,518,4.641304347826087

Elongated heads and bodies take away from a great story. Between the Swiss and Arabic dialogue, there is quite a bit of reading. I enjoy reading books, but reading subtitles really takes me out of the story. When will film makers realize this? I think they believe it makes the film more authentic,  but not knowing the true nature of the dialogue, due to not being able to"" read"" pitch and tone fluctuations in the speech patterns of the characters, makes it confusing and annoying.

3623836,5,B001H606S2,"Arn was an unusually great series.  Yes, as have said numerous reviewers, it is an abbreviated version of the original production.  However, not knowing that and watching what is shown, one wouldn't necessarily feel cheated.

Arn was a young man during the Middle Ages whose actions led him to having to make a choice.  Into the Knights Templar and off to the Holy Land he goes.  The series revolves around his adventures from a lowly ""boy"" to an accomplished swordsman and both friend and enemy of the Moor.

Anyone having watched the series The Vikings would easily find this an enjoyable viewing.",1410134400,,599,4.823529411764706

3623843,2,B001H606S2,"This is a re-release of the earliest US edition that disappointed fans because of it's substantially shortened run time and clipping of many important plots and events from the storyline.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS RE-RELEASE APPEARS TO BE THE ADDITION OF AN ENGLISH DUB to the foreign language portions of the movie.  For authenticity, the original movie employed the appropriate languages for each region where Arn finds himself.  When in Sweden, they speak Swedish, at the English monastery, they speak English.  In the Holy land, he even speaks the native tongue with Salahudin.  This is a virtue of the movie, not a detraction.  I realize many out there try to avoid subtitles at all cost.  I strongly suggest in this case you seek out the original (link below) this time and enjoy the authenticity.  This English dub was not horrible, but I still found it annoying and sub standard.  A very small minority out there may prefer it, but you still don't get the combined movies for the whole story.

The full name of this show is ARN - THE KNIGHT TEMPLAR - and can be found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ARN-The-Knight-Templar-The-Complete-Series-Blu-ray/dp/B007K7IB84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ARN The Knight Templar - The Complete Series [Blu-ray</a>]
The full version is 258 minutes and worth every single second of it!  It is based on a fictional character from the Jan Guillou Trillogy.

This version is indeed the massively shortened version, slightly renamed in order to trick people into buying it again.  Curiousity got the best of me and I actually bought it after I wrote this review and included updates.  Hopefully my expense will save you the effort.  When this was originally released in Europe, the first movie was called Arn, The Knight Templar & the sequal was called Arn, Kingdom at Roads End (they never appeared this way in the US).  Later a combined and shortened version was released in the US (this same movie without the dub).  Fans of that series patiently awaited the full, combined version that finally came out a few years ago in the US and is the link I provided above. Most people who know this show will know the difference.  If you have not heard of it before, you are in for an amazing experience that rivals the best of Crusade movies Hollywood ever produced.  Much more realistic in many ways and absolutely well executed as you would expect from the long line of great Scandinavian cinema.  If you are interested in the genre, Arn is a must own, not a rental!

THE PLOT:  Arn Magnusson is a young boy (son of a prominent nobleman) raised in a local monastery so he can devote his life to God.  A retired knight, now a monk, teaches the boy Arn to fight and realizes his skill lies more in combat than in being a monk.  Arn grows up in the monastery and becomes enamored with a beautiful young girl (Sofia Helin) who sings with the choir in the monastery.  He commits an indiscretion, is falsely accused of further crimes, excommunicated and assigned to do penance by the church through service in the Holy Land, fighting as a Knight Templar for a period of 20 years.  He displays legendary skill and honor, becoming well respected even by his enemy Salahudin and his forces.  They call him - Al Gouti.

While he is in the Holy Land, his love is forced into a convent and abused by the Abbess who is a member of the rival clan to the Magnusson's and close relative to the king.  They are also behind the addition of false charges and his excommunication.  This story has great depth and engages the viewer virtually every moment.  You will want to watch the combined set (two movies in one) in a single setting.  Great conflicts, great adventures, and epoch love will all need to be resolved somehow, and the quest to do so is just plain beautiful.  The condensed version of this movie removes many very important elements and results from the story.  It's not even the same movie really.  If they had to do a re-release for the dub, I wish they had at least done the entire set.  I really don't think this one has much value and I would still prefer the original over the dub had they done it anyway.  Very much so!

Even if you never saw any other version than this butchered release, even with the dub, you would probably still be impressed.  If you see the entire production as intended you will understand exactly where I am coming from.  I cannot recommend strongly enough that you seek out the complete, non dubbed version.  You will notice a few similarities in the plot to Kingdom of Heaven, mainly because it deals with the same time period.  This is absolutely it's own movie, not a knock off.  Kingdom of Heaven is a higher budget, glitzy showpiece that is also one of my favorite movies.  However, in fundamentals I would say there are many areas where this is a superior piece.  Not to mention the entirely separate parts of the story taking place in Sweden.  My negative review does not denigrate the original listing because of the change in title - the two listings are not connected at the time of writing.  The original is FIVE STARS.",1401235200,14,5138,4.727784026996625

Even though it is in subtitles, I had no problem understanding the dialogue or following the plot.  The actors are Scandinavian and the language mostly Swedish which most Norwegians speak as well.  The story is fabulous.  I taught history and political science for 27 years.  But Nordic history is not as well-known as other European history.  This movie also gives insight into the Crusades and the politics, greed and quest for power that had little to do with the lofty goals of saving men's souls which was used to justify the murder and mayhem that was the Crusades.  But looking at the ""forest"" instead of the ""tree"", the Crusaders brought back knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, science, philosophy and culture that dragged Europe out of the dense darkness of the Middle Ages.  This brought about the awakening of Europe from the practice of punishing of anyone
who questioned authority or embraced exploration, thought and dialogue, science as opposed to religion and also brought more humane conditions for those who broke the laws.  The result was the beginning of The Age of Enlightenment.  All of this history is part if the story of ARN.  Be good to yourself.  Watch this movie!",1393459200,,1302,4.922018348623853

The DVD presents a well-balanced intermix of well-done battle scenes and the romantic tale of our hero and a local girl.  Unfortunately for them, their carnal knowledge becomes common knowledge, and they are banished -- she to a convent and he to duty as a Knight Templar in the deserts of the Middle East.  The locations are stunning and the photography excellent, including the scenes of chain-mail-clad Christian crusaders lugging their precious ""true cross"" across the sands while being broiled by the desert sun.  The dialogue is a mixture of English and subtitled Swedish.  The acting is more than adequate, and the makeup and costumes are top notch.  As an example of current Swedish TV productions, this ranks right up there with some of their recent movies, notably in my memory the adaptations of Stieg Larsson's three novels.",1372636800,,1002,4.887573964497041

I enjoyed Arn as much as The Pillars of the Earth & World without  End & recommend  it. The scenery was breath taking & the acting suburb along with the action scenes. It is a story of devotion in 2 people who refused to give in to their clans wishes, the political situation & the church( which in my opinion back then had way too much say so).

3623873,4,B001H606S2,"This movie squishes a three-book series by Jan Guillou into one movie just over two hours long. It follows the full life of Arn Magnusson, a Swedish lad who grows up in a monastery where he's trained in use of sword. He falls for a local girl, but fates intervene and the two are forced to be apart for twenty long years. Cecilia is stuck in a nunnery, while Arn is turned into a Knight Templar and sent off to the Holy Land.

The movie is stunning in how it portrays the many cultures involved in medieval times. Some people tend to think of medieval in terms of a tiny village in England where everyone knew each other, looked the same, and spoke the same language. In reality, many people did travel in medieval times, and cultures often mixed. In their homelands Arn and Cecilia speak Swedish. When he's on the road he speaks English. With the locals in the Middle East he speaks Arabic. Other languages get mixed in as well. Yes, this means subtitles - and it also means you can hear the rich wealth of tones and sounds.

I love the attention to detail. The rough fabric the women wore, the types of chain and armor the soldiers wore, all seem richly evocative of the time period. This movie ended up being the most expensive movie in Swedish history.

There's a lot of history being squished in here. I've read news that this is actually the 2 hour version of a 6 hour miniseries, and I can believe it. I will definitely be trying to get my hands on the longer version. There is so much going on here, from the Swedish battles for control to the battles for Jerusalem. We see how life in a nunnery and monastery was not always as placid as one might believe. In some situations the truncation makes it a bit challenging to follow what is going on if you're not a history buff. Hang in there, it makes sense as you go.

Well recommended as a good view into the challenges of living in medieval time, and something more realistic than a Robin Hood dancing around in green tights :).",1347580800,,1986,4.359459459459459

Ultimately, to avoid needless suspense, the movie was a very pleasant surprise.  I have read other reviews lamenting that the movie was edited and cannot proffer an opinion on that since I have never seen any other version of this film than the one here.

Nevertheless, for what it is worth, this is a solid film, the acting is decent, a little better at times, and somewhat worse at others, but overall the actors did their job.  The visuals were inspiring as was the storyline - in fact, the storyline drove the movie, much more so than any acting or special effects; however, to be fair, Arn, for example, was a little too two-dimensional at times and other characters were not fully developed as well.  This could be due to the unfortunate editing that others have noted before.  However, that aside, the main story was inspiring and entertaining.  Thus, it was, in short, a very pleasant movie littered with noble ideals and strong moral convictions.  Sadly, these two characteristics are too often missing from other contemporary (US) movies and why this movie is a `buy' overall.",1341878400,2,1204,4.672985781990521

3623889,2,B001H606S2,"Having recently watched Black Death and Season of the Witch, Arn - The Knight Templar seemed like a nice way to round out the knight trifecta. Arn is considerably different from those two films.  Where Black Death is about the rejection of paganism in light of a terrible plague and Season of the Witch is about biases against women (and Cage's accent), Arn is more like a historical reenactment.

Things start out promising: Cecilia (Sofia Helin) gives birth in a convent.  The child is proclaimed a bastard and taken away to a chorus of Cecilia's wracking sobs.  What will become of the child? Who is the father?  Why is this nun (she's not a nun) giving birth?  We'll have to wait an hour to find out.

The other plotline is about Arn (Joakim Natterqvist) who is raised by a former Templar in a monastery.  When he returns to his family, Arn has the opportunity to defend his father's honor.  He is instructed to never take a life except in self-defense, so instead of slaying the rival clan leader he just cuts off his arm.  This will have repercussions later.  Much later.

Arn falls in love with Cecilia, who is betrothed to the rival clan.  He ends up bedding Cecilia and is accused by Cecilia's scheming sister of seducing her as well.  These accusations lead to them both being banished for twenty years to their respective convent/monastery.  Arn's simply back where he started of course, so it's not long before he's sent off to fight in the Crusades.  Twenty  years is, as the judge states, ""half a lifetime."" It's a long time for Cecilia to wait until Arn returns for her.  Fortunately for Cecilia, she won't age a year. Unfortunately for us, it takes us over a half hour to get to this point.

Arn is a Swedish film far more interested in presenting a historically accurate narrative than telling a good story. The summary I gave above is more compelling than the way the movie lays it out.  This is because it's actually a hacked up version of a much longer miniseries.  It shows.

At times the movie drags.  When Arn has a sit down with Saladin (yes, THE Saladin) we can guess what's going to happen.  When Cecilia pines for Arn, we can guess what's going to happen.  When Cecilia gives a cheesy cross to Arn, we can guess it will be given back in his bloodied hand at the very end of the story.  All these obvious plot points would be excusable if the editor made any effort to provide suspense, or drama, or anything besides a beat-by-beat retelling of two different tales that only intermingle occasionally.

There's also the complete lack of acting makeup.  Arn grows a beard, which helps make him look a little more grizzled, but Cecilia doesn't age a day.  You get the impression director Peter Flinth is proud of the fact that this movie is without artifice, but that doesn't make it any less distracting.

Beautifully shot with real locations and a dizzying array of languages, accents, and ethnicities, Arn feels like an epic...in dire need of an epic editor.",1329091200,,2984,4.6072106261859584

I quite like how the personal and impersonal religious and military apsects are in a fine balance of respect for Faith and its trials -- including an unsually balanced view of Christendom and the Islam of Saladin -- AND a most unusually balanced [even favorable] view of the Knights of the Temple +++",1322870400,3,962,4.631578947368421

That explains why many characters felt woefully underdeveloped and why the plot sometimes left me scratching my head.

The acting is good, and the plot is intriguing. The battle scenes, particularly the final one, leave much to be desired in terms of realism. Additionally, too many modern phrases make their way into a movie set in the 12th century.

Overall, I enjoyed this as a light action film, but I would have loved to see what the production team did in the original two movies, rather than this abridged version.",1318377600,3,697,4.612903225806452

The only negative issue (to some) is the necessary reliance on subtitling.  For me, this was essential as my proficiency in Scandinavian or Arabic dialects is nonexistent.

Perhaps longer, more inclusive alternatives to this presentation are available.  This in no way diminishes the quality of this film.",1315699200,,520,5.37037037037037

I managed to get a special edition from Europe after grabbing the European/International 2+ hour theatrical release DVD, but wanted to see more.  So I went ahead and splurged on a R2 disc to see what I was missing out on.

Wow.

Shot as an 8 hour feature film, it's easy to see why thing was so darn expensive, and it shines for it.  Even so there are some improvements to be made.  Notably the leads acting, though very respectable, isn't as thurough as one could expect.  He plays the ""innocent monk"" part to a fault, but doesn't dare much beyond that.

The rest of the film is very respectable and worthy of an extended view.  An excellent period piece that was probably the forerunner to Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" in concept and production, but fell by the way side due to the expense of this expansive project.  As such came out a few years later.  More's the pity, but the wait is worth it.

Give it a chance.",1315440000,2,1179,4.398148148148148
3623909,5,B001H606S2,"This fabulous production IS available, all ca. 258 minutes of it, almost 5 hours, from AmazonGermany, in a 4 disc set, 3 discs for the movie and 1 disc for extras.  It's a tad expensive...and it's only subtitled in German.  With shipping, I ended up paying about $40...the shipping cost more than the boxed set!  The box is handsome and well designed and the video and audio quality excellent.

As the dialogue is minimal, the subtitling was not all that challenging for my 3 years of college German (35 years ago).  The story tells itself quite well visually, and the few times the dialogue became somewhat complex, it was easy enough to freeze the picture and work on the subtitles.  If anyone is game, it's worth the effort.  Keep a dictionary handy.  AmazonGermany works just like AmazonUSA and AmazonUK.  It's easy enough to click your way through to checkout.

The movie is spectacular.  I have to agree with the reviewer who said ""Arn"" is in the great epic filmaking style of the past.  I enjoyed every moment of it.  The sets and costumes were impressive and made the time and places recreated very convincing.  The battles were well done.  Though not full blood-and-guts as a larger budget may have allowed, there was tremendous tension in the battle preparations and the initial assault.  Some brief battle scenes and then the aftermath, showing the carnage and slaughter.  Very effective.  The audio helped tremendously in building the drama.

Beside the many actors reviewers have pointed out, I should mention Michael Nyquist (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" etc.) as Arn's father.  It was a pleasure seeing him again as I enjoyed the Millenium film trilogy greatly.  All the actors were fine and did their work well.  Editing was topnotch and the movie flowed easily from beginning to end, inspite of the obvious fadeouts for commercials.  The musical score, never overwhelming, was a solid part of the presentation and added great beauty to a magnificently photographed film.

3623912,5,B001H606S2,"Despite the unevenness due to truncated editing, this is one of the best historical epics on the era of the Crusades that I have seen, including even the Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven that cost three times the $$$.

Most recent historical epics put a modern anti-religious spin on the Middle Ages, but anyone who has actually studied the period knows that religion permeated European culture. This is the first film of the period I have seen that depicts children being placed in monasteries to be raised by monks, women being placed in convents as penance for sins or because of family poverty, and in this case, a son sent to join the Knights Templar in the Holy Land to alleviate a potential clan conflict.

These were common historical realities of life in the Middle Ages that I have read about in the history books, but rarely seen depicted in film accounts of the period. In this film, religious devotion is assumed and shown rather then discussed in the dialogue. There are numerous scenes of Arn praying while clutching the ivory cross his beloved gave him, or praying while staring at the cross on his sword pommel. The Templars all kneel together in prayer before an important battle.

The film has a lot of small historical touches, such as the sophisticated medical care Arn receives from his Muslim captors who carefully stitch a huge gash on his face after the battle of Hattin. This is Muslim return hospitality for Arn having saved the life of Saladin earlier in the movie. These touches add to the historical realism of the film.",1309478400,5,1553,4.723247232472325
3623913,5,B001H606S2,"I really like all the epic movies with knights and battles especially when mixed with a dash of love and heartache. If you love a good love story and are into the Knights and or Knights Templar this is a great movie. UUUGH!, So GOOD!",1309478400,,233,4.2
3623924,3,B001H606S2,"I understand that this film was produced at a budget of $30m, then the most paid for a Swedish film (I don't know if it still is). That this film has had significant money spent on it is clear, the sceneray, sets and, as other reviewers have noted, the battle scenes are of a high standard.

A film that is not produced in the hollywood bubble, particularly onethe that is based outside of a US/UK context, will find it hard to produce a work that appeals a significant percentage of movieviewers - I think Arn does that.

However, despite its strengths which do make this a film worth viewing I did find the film's continuity and plot unconvincing. There are two major plot lines that run through the film (and here the spoliers start so you may want to stop reading here). First there is a romance conquering over all obstacles put in its way angle which, to be truthful was well done if you like that sort of thing. Second, there is a an interesting theme of violence and diplomacy that I felt could have been developed substantially but which, ultimately, seems to be tangential. In Arn we have a man who was foreceably compelled by the Church to take up arms in the Holy Land where he proves to be an effective soldier. However, unlike some foolish Knight Templar who fight uncritically and feel assured of victory because they fight under the auspices of the Holy Cross Arn is more realist and develops a mutual respect for Saladin, the leader of the opposing army. This mutual respect mean Arn is healed and allowed to leave whilst the rest of the Knights Templar are killed. After a touching ""can't we all just learn to get along"" moment Saladin allows Arn to leave.

However, on his return to his homeland we find that Arn effectively and without explanation renounces this new found respect for diplomacy by defending his homeland and, without attempt at conciliation slaughter the invaders which, the end credits tell us (this is remember a fictional story) forged the basis for national self-identification for decades to come. This surprising twist is entirely unexplained, although I wonder if the unedited original explained this theme. My point is not to be all moralistic but simply Arn, the central character doesn't really ring true.

So, in summary, a good all round feel good movie but as a film that provokes thought as well as emotional response it leaves a little to be desired but still worthy of a viewing.",1309046400,2,2432,4.675233644859813
3623925,4,B001H606S2,After hiring Arn The Knight Templar it was disappointing as I could see that this was a much longer movie. It turn out to be two movies. I would not purchase it as it was disjointed. I have always wanted to see the whole thing. Well you would not believe but down under they have just release a 2 disc bonus 60 minutes extended version. It looks like it is the two films that was release in Scandinavia as each disc as a distinct movie on them that follow on from each other. It was great to watch these two movies and see the whole story.

3623926,4,B001H606S2,"As others have said, this movie was put together out of a miniseries, and it definitely shows.  The movie is good, the costumes and acting are first-class, but you just get the feeling throughout that you're missing out on a lot of really good scenes and a lot of dialogue that would make everything better.  Not only that, it would likely make some seems that just seem random probably make perfect sense.

The film is in English, Swedish, Arabic, and Latin, with most of it being in Swedish.  Still, the subtitles are well done and easy-to-read, so if you're a historical film buff, the languages will not be a problem.  I would've given this movie five stars but for the fact that you can obviously tell they cut the battle scenes short and there are obvious gaps in the story line that you're left to just assume about how certain things occurred.  It's well worth purchasing, but, I'd really like to get the complete series and spend a few evenings watching it.",1307491200,,966,4.587209302325581
3623927,5,B001H606S2,"There are two principal reasons epic films about the history of the Crusades or the Middle Ages don't get made: 1) the atheist Left has been successful in slandering and demonizing Christianity for every conceivable evil, thus religion warred against ""love"", no one was ennobled, there were no heroes, it was all a sham and hypocrisy, blah, blah, blah, so we make few films about all the heroism in our history; all our heroes have to be one-dimensional super-heroes from the futuristic comic-books. And, 2) the films are inherently so damn expensive to make.  (An aside: most even ""educated"" people also confuse the ""Dark Ages"" (476-732 AD) of the mostly pagan, and destructive, barbarians with their mostly Christianized descendants who built the Christendom of the Middle Ages (c. 800-1300 AD). This film can be called, it's true, choppy, and confusing with its use of flashbacks.  And of course if you do not like sub-titles, then you cannot watch many foreign films, right?  But I was blown away by the Faith of the principal characters, and the Romance of it all.  The film was also good at illustrating how personal, petty, and political motivations are used within Christ's Church by some with faithless agendas, but that has been going on since Judas Iscariot. (We Catholics do not like evil done when claiming divine or ecclesial authority anymore than do atheists.) Finally, it takes guts to make the most expensive Swedish film production ever, and I exclaimed near the end of this truncated version, ""Kudos to you guys for making this film!""  What I saw was well-done, so that I wanted to see the rest of the Swedish mini-series, hoping it was of the same high quality. A very unusual modern-day film. It made me want to read more about the origins of the history of Sweden and Norway, and to read the historical novels upon which the film(s) was based.",1307059200,3,1866,4.836990595611285
3623928,4,B001H606S2,"This is the Swedish epic that tells part of the story of Arn, who helped to forge Sweden into a real nation. In Sweden this was two films that ran to over 250 minutes. Here they have been melded down to 130 minutes. So I have some sympathy for the negative reviews that have called this a mish, mash etc. However, it is still a ruddy good effort.

Arn is schooled in a monastery as a way of thanking God for saving his life after an illness (not uncommon practice). He leans more towards archery and sword play than Bible study and so his path to serving God as a soldier is pretty much mapped out. He falls for the daughter of a rival clan and as punishment she gets sent to a nunnery and he has to go off to the Holy Land and serve with the Knights Templar. This is not the story of the Crusades but does deal with it in part, but not very well for historical purists, but the real story here is the love story between Arn and Cecilia, and I felt that there was chemistry and thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting is all pretty much on the money and the cinematography is excellent. And it is epic in the cast and also battle scenes, though I have seen better, but that is a small point. Joakim Natterqvist and Sofia Helin are both excellent and Simon Callow is there for us Brits. Whilst there is the usual 'poetic licence' taken with the plot, this just adds to the narrative and helps sweep yopu and the plot along.

There have been complaints about the language and I see that might be a problem for some, it is mainly English, but with dialogue in Swedish, Arabic and Latin; I found the subtitles very good and in no way detracted from my enjoyment. However both the Amazon description and the DVD box do not mention the foreign language which has upset a few people.

It was so obvious after the first 20 minutes of the movie that important parts had been deleted that I had a hard time watching it all the way through. For the Swedish producers, making such an effort and spending so much money to produce a series which compares more than favorably with similar movies, and then letting someone butcher it, is incomprehensible. I sincerely hope that a full international version will be available in the future. After all, it happened to ""The Lord of the Rings"", why not ""Arn""?

3623961,5,B001H606S2,"It's quite sad that a movie that was released in 2007 takes until October 2010 to get a BD release here, especially when it's this good. I guess that's not unusual for European films, especially subtitled ones, which it's deemed by someone to not be mainstream enough for US audiences?
The story was broken up into two movies in 2007, and 2008 originally so to get the ""whole"" story so to speak, is almost worth the wait, albeit in truncated form.
That being said, apparently the original version ( a truly lavish scale of production by European standards ) was released initially in a Mini Series format running about 6 hours in total, much like the original German version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Das-Boot-The-Original-Uncut-Version/dp/B0001XAOLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Das Boot - The Original Uncut Version</a>
To date, no plans have been made to make this version available, and although it is possible to get the original two movies - ARN: The Knight Templar, and ARN: The Kingdom at Roads End on DVD, they are hard to find, and in PAL format, or region 2 coded.

Arn (played by Joakim Nattergvist) is based on the trilogy of books by Swedish author Jan Guillou, and although I have not read the books, I consider this adaptation to be a rare treat for fans of the genre.
It's easy to quickly draw many comparisons with movies like ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and even the Lord of the Rings trilogy in some ways, partly due to the fact that the movie is so well made. The acting is great throughout, the locations impressive, and the battle scenes are graphic and realistic.
Some will feel that the battle scenes are scant, even though they are done on a grand scale, but the story is about the struggle, not just the fighting.

It's a story of two parts really.
A young boy growing up in 12th century Sweden is taken by his parents to a monastery as he has an illness, and is not expected to reach adulthood.
While there, he is taken under the wing of a monk who previously ""served God"" in the holy crusades, and he nurtures Arn's apparent natural talent with weapons to teach him the finer arts of fighting, swordplay and archery - something the youngster takes to well, aided by the fact he is naturally ambidextrous.
Historically, much of Europe around the time the movie is set, was not as geographically delineated as it is today, many countries were a loose collection of warring fiefdoms, vying for power, land and the throne, and Sweden was no exception. It is during one such encounter that while defending his fathers honor, he makes an enemy of the powerful Svenger clan.
Against the wishes of his family, the young Arn also falls in love with Cecilia, the daughter of a local family betrothed to the Svenger clan to help cement an alliance between the two most powerful families trying to control the country.
Through lies and scorn he is sent to the Holy Land as a Crusader to do penance for 20 years, while his young bride to be is sentenced likewise for 20 years in a local convent, run by a vicious Abbess, who is sympathetic to the Svenger clan.
Half of the movie centers on her struggle and life in Sweden, and the other on Arn's arduous and battle ridden path through the Holy land.

I'm not going to go into much more detail than that really, and that's about as much information you would get from the movie trailer anyway, so not really a spoiler.

Compressing three books into one movie, that runs just under two and a quarter hours, I'm sure will leave some plot holes for people who have read the books, but to me it felt very complete.
It's also going to feel a little slow to some people, this movie is as much about love and family as it is about fighting and the crusades.
despite these two points, I strongly recommend seeing this movie.

There are those who will be put off by subtitles, although a large portion of the movie is in English. What is particularly well done is that all the characters speak their own language, Arabic, French, Swedish and English, clearly stated on screen with the subtitles, so it's easy to keep up.

There are a few familiar faces US viewers will probably recognize, not least Stellen Skarsgard, but most I'm sure like me will be amazed that they haven't seen Joakim Nattergvist in anything before.
This is top notch acting, whichever way you look at it, from the whole cast but particularly him.
Focused, driven and really believable in the role, he seems to embrace all aspects of Arn's character.
This feels to me like old fashioned story telling, with modern technology kept to a minimum. It feels ""Epic""

If you like this kind of movie genre, see this film. 5 stars",1291593600,7,4691,4.685679611650485
3623962,2,B001H606S2,"I rented the international version of this film.

Only the last fighting scene is good. It's exciting, fierce, and on a large scale. All the others are so brief that I can't feel any thing.
The love between the two main characters is so abrupt that it does not stir up my emotion at all.
The only good thing about this movie is it successfully portrays Arn's courage and compassion. He fought on even though he fatally wounded. He spared his enemies' lives when he had the chance to kill  them.

According to ""Cannucklehead Film Addict"", one of the other reviewers, this movie was a TV mini series. This international version is about two-third shorter than the original. No wonder, the scenes showing the love between 2 main characters are so short. What a waste!",1291075200,2,764,4.644444444444445

Based on actual Swedish history, this film has an excellent story line and great acting. This is actually the second part of two flims done on this Story, as far as I can tell, the first part never made it to the United States and it actually featured the Lead Actor as the young Arn and tells the back story of what lead up to his coming to the Monks at the Monestary as a young boy. I would not have known about the first film had I not watched the behind the scenes feature that was included on the DVD/Blu-ray disc. If that film ever became available here in the United States I would buy it. Although I was not familar with Joakim Natterqvist (the lead Actor) it was the Story itself that caught my eye. There is one international Swedish film star in the movie however that I believe most people would know, Stellan Skarsgard (of ""Mama Mia"" fame)and the father of Eric Skarsgard of ""True Blood"". If you are into history as I am, I would highly recommend this film. It is both worth watching and owning.

As I neared the end of the movie, I couldn't wait to see the second movie, but then I realized that they edited in the ending of the second movie! The 2 movies are each around 2.5 hours in their own right, and some imbecile cut it down to just over 2 hours! This means that there is lost plot! Lost sub-plots! There are missing characters! There is an entire MISSING MOVIE!

THIS BLU-RAY IS MISSING OVER 2 HOURS OF THE ACTUAL MOVIE!

This is some kind of insulting scam. Never pay more than 5 dollars for this! This is basically just a 2 hour preview. This is NOT what the screenwriter or director intended. Americans are not dumb. We like foreign movies as they are. We dislike chopped edits of what is considered a great epic. We like STORY. We like artistic vision. We hate re-edited, moronic marketing scams of international art.

It felt weird that parts of this EDITED FOR DUMB AMERICANS VERSION was actually in English. It's nice that it wasn't a dub, but was the English even necessary? It was very well acted. It has great cinematography. It has an effective (although clich&eacute;d) soundtrack. Stunning visuals. But you only get to enjoy less than half of the full story! Entire battles happen with little explanation.

Please release the original version in the United States.

I'm asking for a 50% DISCOUNT because this is not the product it appears or claims to be. I hope Amazon steps up and corrects the posting for this item. ""RE-EDITED SHORTER AMERICAN VERSION"" should be in the product's title. Amazon is guilty of falsely advertising this truncated version of the product they claim to be selling.

This is a negative blu-ray review for a beautiful production. The other half of the production IS NOT ON THIS DISC!

The director ,Peter Flinth, has given us a grand epic of honor and treachery all focused on the love story between Arn and Cecilia with religion, once again, separating true love. It contains so much passion with some great performances within its structure.  You will recognize of course Bibi Anderson as the mother superior and Sven Bertil Taube ( the only other movie I know of his is a guilty pleasure- 'PUPPET ON A CHAIN') as the Bishop also Steven Waddington from 'THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS' as the Grand Master of the Templar Knights.

This is a really good story in the historical epic category. It propounds to be based in fact and, though I don't know how much they had to tweek it for script purposes, it contains certain things that feel true.

Arn is a Swede who falls in love with a woman who is betrothed to another family. He knocks her up so she has to do 20 years in a convent while he has to do twenty years in the Crusades as a Knight Templar. As he himself was raised by the church he's a very serious dude. He was also schooled well in combat by a monk who did time in the Crusades so he can fight with the best of them. He heads off to the Holy Land where he becomes key in winning some battles. His time is up so he heads home to be with his woman but ends up facing a whole new challenge. It seems Sweden isn't all that united and there is a new grab for power he needs to thwart.

This is an Historical Epic in the best sense. Great locations, costumes and lots of extras. You like Arn. He's a cool guy because he's good and devout, but can kick booty if he needs to. You like Cecelia his girlfriend. She's pretty and has a good spirit. It's acted well, shot well, edited well. The music score is good, though maybe a bit too similar to the ""Lord of the Rings"" score but that's a minor quibble. I also could have used a bit more in the building of the relationship between the two Cecelias, but again, it's a minor quibble. Surprisingly, they spent little effort on the major battle scenes. Were this Ridley Scott or Antoine Fuqua we'd have been dazzled by meticulous staging and swordplay. But here the director just didn't seem that interested. It's as though the battle scenes were no more important than anything else going on. I could have used more there myself but they were good enough to get the point across and move me to the next scene.

This is a good, solid effort. It has all the right things in all the right measure. If you're disposed to this sort of thing then have at it. It's well worth your while.",1287014400,71,2170,4.1350710900473935
