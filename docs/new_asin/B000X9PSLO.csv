8227599,5,B000X9PSLO,"The airdate is specified as June 8, 1993 (after the actor's death), but I presume the interview was first broadcast live on June 8, 1983--the prompt being that Perkins was undertaking Psycho II, 22 years after the original Hitchcock film.

Interviewer Greg Jackson stays out of frame. The cameras concentrate on closeups of Perkins, whose forehead is deeply incised owing to habitual arching of his eyebrows. There are no rude Gotcha questions. Perkins maintains eye contact and does not succumb to showing off. His dark thick hair shows smidges of graying. His chin doesn't seem a bit undersize. His lower teeth appear, but hardly his upper. He wears a rich-blue shirt, honey-colored suede jacket, dark gray pants, and white socks--not a fashion statement.

His marriage plus two sons, after years of gay life and ""successful"" analysis, peaks my interest (but gayness is graciously skipped over in this interview, and his wife, 16 years his junior, is not named--Berry Berenson, 1948-2001--but she began to love Tony when she was only 12). Perkins concludes the interview, happy with his personal life and ready to consider new work as it just comes along.",1380499200,4,1157,5.08421052631579
