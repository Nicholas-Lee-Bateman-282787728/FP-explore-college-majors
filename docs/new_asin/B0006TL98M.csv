8043063,3,B0006TL98M,"Unless you're a fan of British horror films, the name Tigon (a combination of tiger & lion, their logo was a lion with tiger stripes - see the upper right corner of the DVD box) would mean nothing to you. Between 1966 with the release of Michael Reeves' THE SORCERERS and 1973's THE CREEPING FLESH, Tigon and executive producer Tony Tenser released over 20 films and took on Hammer and Amicus as the leading purveyors of British Horror. They even tried to purchase Hammer in the early 1970s but the deal fell through which was just as well for both companies as the British Horror boom would wane considerably after the release of THE EXORCIST in 1973. This quaint coffin box set from the British arm of Anchor Bay contains the best and worst of Tigon's output and shows you what the company could and shouldn't have done. The set is Region 2 and it contains the original U.K. prints which differ somewhat from their American releases. Many of these titles are now becoming available on Region 1 DVDs or on streaming video. Whether it's the American or British prints, I can't say but they are worth checking out.

The contents range from the sublime (WITCHFINDER GENERAL, THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW) to the ridiculous (THE BODY STEALERS and VIRGIN WITCH) with THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR and BEAST IN THE CELLAR squarely in the middle. Unfortunately WITCHFINDER GENERAL uses an old, substandard print of the Continental version with censored scenes sloppily edited back in. The remaining 5 prints range from very good to excellent with VIRGIN WITCH ironically being the best looking followed by BEAST, HORROR, THE BODY STEALERS, and SATAN'S CLAW in that order. The uneven HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR is probably the first teenage slasher film while BEAST IN THE CELLAR is like a Harold Pinter play with gruesome murders. THE BODY STEALERS is bad but fun while SATAN'S CLAW is hypnotic and unforgettable. The ""coffin"" comes with a booklet of info on the company's history and is definitely worthwhile to those in the know. Unfortunately other Tigon films like THE SORCERERS and CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR  (both with Boris Karloff) are not available here. An interesting set but it could have been better.",1414972800,9,2200,4.817460317460317
