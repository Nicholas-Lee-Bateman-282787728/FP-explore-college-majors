198791,1,1584481358,"""The Greatest Places"" has a syrupy and cloying narrative. I often used MUTE in order to endure it.
I give it 1 star. If Avery Brooks could only have had laryngitis that day ... this movie could have earned a 3 instead (without *any* narration). The low grade for the movie really isn't Brooks' fault, although he does a superb job of melodically drawing out each sappy line with his highly skilled voice. At the end, watching the credits, I cursed the writer.
Moving on to the cinematography: Some of the images were, as you should expect, quite breathtaking! I was especially engaged by Madagascar and Namib. But the power of this imagery was consistently undermined with choppy editing and many dozens of abrupt cuts (every 15 to 20 seconds) from panoramic landscapes to adorably cute animals and other close-ups.
Arrggghh ... how frustrating! Each time that amazing scenery sweeps over you with its awesomeness and spectacle, it's crudely jerked away and replaced with something to make a first grader go ""awww that's cute"".
What's the movie about, anyway? Is it supposed to be Places (geography, landscapes) or biology (cute animals and closeups of flora & fauna)? I'm not sure the creators of Greatest Places had a clear idea about their concept.
The frequent changes in scale -- from viewing aerials of miles of landscape and switching to face-shots of baby animals -- are enough to give you vertigo, or at least a headache.
The movie began with a valid concept. But together with a horrible writer, Brooks' outstanding saccharine execution of a juvenile narrative, and ""gotta get a little of every shot in here"" editing, the entire movie was lost. I wouldn't watch it again (but I would order some 16 x 20 color prints from the movie's imagery.)

198792,4,1584481358,"The movie and the sound is good. I may rate as 5 stars if this movie is not too short. It lasts when you just get relaxed. But despite this,it worths to buy.  This dvd means traveling the most interesting places in your home!!",969494400,5,226,4.136363636363637
198793,5,1584481358,"When I went to see this in IMAX, I had NO idea about any of these places.  But this short, yet fun documentry broadened my eyes and made me think about these places.  GREATEST PLACES is one of the truly greatest (IMAX  films)!",961286400,3,226,4.209302325581396
198794,3,1584481358,"An Imax film with no real plot or story, its a short tour of some of ""The Greatest Places"" on Planet Earth. (I would have given the film an extra star if there had been some sort of ""connection""  for the audience). There are some truely stunning wildlife and location  images in the films 40 minutes and because of that it really needs to be  seen either at an Imax cinema or on a large sceen TV, but even on my TV at  home it looked incredible. The film visits the Amazon, Namib, Greenland,  Okavango, Greenland, Tibet, Iguazu and Madagascar spending differnt amounts  of time at each. Some of the places visited deserved a bit more time spent  on them while others could have been a bit shorter. An interesting feature  of this DVD that I'd like to see more of is the seperate Music and Ambiance  track. You can turn off the narration, (which is a bit corny at times), and  just listen to the music and natural sounds. The only problem with this  feature is that the music decreases in volume where the narration would be  then comes up again when the narration stops. (Also features a description  track for the blind). Dispite this the music and natural sounds are  excellent. Well worth repeated viewing for the armchair tourist.",946598400,17,1234,4.524886877828054

198796,3,1584481358,It's not one of the best IMAX movies out there. But is very interesting and very well presented. The audio and video are of great quality. The only reason I couldn't rate it great was because 40 min. is too short a time to  cover 6 great places in the world. I wish they made it at least 60 min.,939168000,10,295,3.9166666666666665
198797,5,1584481358,The Greatest Places is beautifully filmed and helps you feel that you are there. It's nice to be able to see scenic wonders that you might not have the opportunity to see in person.,1389830400,,181,4.352941176470588
198798,3,1584481358,"This was hard to follow as far as the ""story line"" goes, but the footage was great. It went back and forth a bit and was hard to tell where they were for awhile and what made the ""place great"". It wasn't bad, just odd the way it was laid out I guess.",1389139200,,250,3.7358490566037736
198799,4,1584481358,"It's a daunting task to make a video series which claims to cover the ""Greatest Places."" There are so many amazing places in the world the time restrictions on a series like this require the producers to make so very difficult decisions. They're also on the hook to pick places that are going to be great, but they don't want to just pick the standard top places, they have to throw in some surprises without neglecting the more commonly known great places. Anyway, they did a pretty good job, definitely worth watching when you just want to put something in and zone out.",1382918400,,572,4.563106796116505
198800,4,1584481358,"I was eager to watch this as I received it yesterday. Great I MAX, but too short. I was expecting a the narrator to talk about a lot more great places in the world. He
missed quite a few. For the most part, visually wise very nice I MAX.",1339545600,2,237,3.857142857142857

198802,5,1584481358,"TO WHOMEVER HAS THE POWER TO MAKE SUCH DECISIONS....
This is SUCH a beautiful DVD -- one of the best IMAX pieces of eye-candy I've ever savored (repeatedly, i might add!).  The visuals are so staggeringly magnificent that this has to be made into a Blu-Ray... and it is wonderful to watch in its current format, so i can only imagine how gobsmackingly fantastic it would be in Blu-Ray.  SO -- all of you who loved this DVD also... I'd like to join you in recommending it to anyone who wants to sit back and be transported to some of the most amazing places on earth.  And second, I'd like to encourage you to join me in campaigning for this dvd to be converted into blu-ray.  i cannot even imagine it being more beautiful than it was already -- the possibilities are so exciting!  So -- yeah -- buy it if you don't have it in DVD...and lets try to earn the opportunity to buy it again in blu-ray! :-)
This is one of the few dvd's i will not be at all annoyed to pay for twice when i buy it again on blu-ray;  nuff said.",1239667200,2,1019,4.147208121827411
198803,2,1584481358,"I would have given this movie another star if I didn't have to endure all the THEORY TALE.  The beginning was hard to endure as they tried to indoctrinate everyone with the evolution theory.  Remember, it has never been observed.

The whole Pangea theory was funny though.  To think that the continents drifted apart as if the world was a large pond and the continents were lily pads.  Hey, if you take all the water out of the oceans guess what you will find?  That's right kids the continents are connected.

Once the indoctrination stopped the movie was bearable.  It had fairly good shots and a good variety.  I think the part about Tibet was the best.  You don't learn much about Tibet in your nature docs.

The narrator was the kind you want when you tired and bored.  Hint, He is boring.  His voice was as interesting as watching ants carry food through the grass.  It lacked excitement, and it seemed he was labouring.",1208908800,4,926,4.533333333333333
198804,5,1584481358,"Greatest Places: IMAX is collectible and awe-inspiring, however, it is a very quick journey to vast expansive landscapes that will require further exploration. Once you are introduced to seven of the most amazing places on earth, you can then look up additional IMAX movies.

The footage in this DVD captures vibrant moments in stunning beauty. An elephant rises from a river in a display of pure power and herds sweep across dry landscapes creating an almost primal glory as hooves thunder across the African plains. Almost indescribably beautiful waterfalls, majestic rivers and towering icebergs contrast with the Namib Desert and Tibetan plateau.

The filming takes place mostly in places with lush vegetation and abundant water, making this especially nurturing and healing. The lives of the animals featured throughout are captured with a sense of artistic perfection.

The extras include Audio tracks in English, French and German. There is also a detailed soundtrack so you can listen to the movie with your eyes closed and imagine the scenery.

198805,3,1584481358,"I have enjoyed IMAX films in the past, in particular, ""Everest"", but this 1998 release directed by Mal Wolfe is comparatively disappointing. The primary problem is one of scope. In the span of forty minutes, we are taken to seven diverse locations around the globe - Madagascar, the Amazon basin, Iguazu Falls between Brazil and Argentina, the Tibetan plateau, the Namib Desert in southwestern Africa, the Okavango Delta in Botswana, and Greenland - each of which warrants its own IMAX film. While each segment offers visual treats worth savoring, the consequence of the ambitious scope is that the film feels cursory and the perspective unbalanced. Each locale certainly lends a certain exoticism, but ultimately, the choice of places feels somewhat arbitrary, as one could count off other areas that hold as much intrigue, for example, the Galapagos Islands, Patagonia, the Serengeti, the Australian outback, the Mariana Trenches, etc.

In the film, some areas like Madagascar and Greenland get relatively more time, while coverage of other areas like Iguazu Falls is hardly more than a series of panoramic snapshots. Granted Chuck Davis's cinematography is razor-sharp and often breathtaking, the vertical depth of IMAX films seems particularly cut-off in this film's translation to the TV screen, which at times makes one wonder what is going on below the screen. Compounding the problem is the pretentious script by Pamela Stacey, full of high-minded descriptions that come off rather condescending and remedial as actor Avery Brooks (the Captain on the ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" TV series) tries his best to mimic the stentorian vigor of James Earl Jones in his narration. As a result, the film feels targeted toward middle school students taking geography rather than interested armchair global travelers like myself. It's obvious that the film took a lot of effort, apparently three years of effort to complete, but sadly, I have to say it's more an eye-pleasing series of movable postcards that lend minimal insight into the eco-history of these areas.",1138492800,2,2064,5.254545454545455
198806,3,1584481358,"I watched this DVD shortly after returning from 7 months straight of traveling around Asia, India/Nepal, Arabia, and Australia. I started it up with much anticipation, hoping it would wet my appetite (Which needed and continues to get a rest at the moment) for more travel to places further afield.

Unfortunately, I have to agree with an earlier reviewer. The video skips around so fast and frequently that hardly enough time is given to enjoying the manificient landscapes that the video team traveled too. I found myself replaying certain sections and pressing the pause button. This video could have been so much more. They started with a great idea.

The off the beaten path destinations themselves make me give this video 3 stars. Perhaps the preferred IMAX feature length does not lend itself to such a video that travels to numerous places. Perhaps if the team concentrated on 1/2 as many places the result would have been better.",1094083200,9,938,4.930379746835443

7799439,1,1584481358,"The family sat down ready to enjoy some views of some wonderful places on Earth.  Instead we got a very short (45 mins?) look into a few places piled together at random.  We didn't feel like we really learned anything about any of the places, or the animals and people that inhabit them.  The Greenland segment is laughingly short.  We see animals and landscapes that pique the interest but they they are whisked away and we cross the globe to some other place.  If this film was three of four times longer, we might get just the merest look at the places featured.  As it is, this film is laughingly poor and unsatisfying.",1419984000,,623,4.469026548672566
