1413685,5,B00005AAEI,"Words cannot describe the emotional impact of seeing veterans of the Pearl Harbor attack tell their stories, of lost friends, of survival, of their families back home. Completely incredible video of the interior of Arizona.  I consider myself a big, strong ""he-man"" who doesn't get emotional about such things as the endings of movies and television shows. But my wife and I found ourselves with tears in our eyes watching this tape, to the point of sobbing.  This is much more than just a documentary. ... it's worth at least double the price. Buy this tape if you care anything at all about Pearl Harbor, World War II, history in general or if you're simply fascinated by ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.",991872000,15,721,4.901639344262295

1413688,5,B00005AAEI,"The documentary had a great combination of telling the story about what happened on Dec. 7, 1941 and interviews with WWII Pearl Harbor survivors. I showed it to my 8th grade history class. They were all paying careful attention. I especially found the eyewitness memories informative, interesting, and moving. I believe those testimonies gave my students a better idea about the horrors of war. They live in a world of video game and movie violence that has no consequences. Seeing these men vividly remember the sights and sounds of that day 60 years later shows my students that war not only has national consequences but personal consequences to the individuals involved.",1396742400,2,674,5.081081081081081

I was expecting more from an ""ultimate"" WWII collection.

Mickey Ganitch is a Pear Harbor Survivor, USS Pennsylvania Ship and he is 94 years old. He was there on his ship. Mickey said, this was a very good documented. My very first trip to Hawaii Dec 2010 and see Pear Harbor. Mickey gave me history of that day. It bring tears and see Arizona ship and memorial center.

1413694,4,B00005AAEI,"The Attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan is covered thoroughly by Tom Brokaw.

The students like the first hand accounts of what people actual saw/felt. However, it seemed that the sound was sort of off in places and someone would be telling their story and it would get louder and quieter a lot which made for some annoying controlling of the volume the entire time.",1382572800,,445,4.575

1413704,5,B00005AAEI,"This is a good American history lesson with NBC Anchor Tom Brokaw.  There are many rare footage for this sneak attack which was well planned and coordinated. Why Uncle Sam failed all the warning and intelligence?  Japan tried hard in crippling the American Asian Fleet and swept through their invasion and occupation of South-East Asia.

Japan had manufactured the September 18 1931 Incident to attack  and occupy China and eventually waged a full scale war by July 7 1937 with an excuse.  China endured the brutal atrocities of Rape of Nanking and later germ/chemical warfare.  China engaged Japan in her massive continent alone and prevented their dream of joining forces with Nazi Germany in Middle East to enslave the world.

The 1942 April Doolittle raid on Tokyo was encouraging news.  But the Bataan Death March and hell ship killed many American POWs.  The surviving POWs were enslaved in coal mine as hard labor in violation of Geneva Conventions with poor nutrition and no medical care.

This year will be 70th Commemoration of this attack.  Our former POWs still suffered physical and mental problems without the sincere apology and compensation.  This former enemy and now ally did not have the courage and moral to restore our veterans the dignity and honor.

Forgetting history will doom to repeat itself.  Shall we keep alert to prevent another Tora! Tora! Tora!?",1305417600,,1378,5.013215859030837

I had read about it in history classes, and had seen Hollywood's various reenactments of it, but I was quite unmoved until I saw National Geographic's attention to detail in documenting the this brutal assault on our nation.

1413716,4,B00005AAEI,"This DVD Collection is most likely mislabeled...  The Ultimate WWII Collection probably makes a casual observer think that this set covers the war from start to finish,  It doesn't.  2 of the 3 DVD's cover the first 6 months of America's involvement in the war (Pearl Harbor and Midway).  The third DVD is a little disjointed in terms of trying to tell a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and ending.

Pearl Harbor and Midway are utterly fantastic.  These 2 DVD's tell the tale and have excellent mix between live footage, interviews and graphics.  You will not be bored with these two at all.  Both tell the story of the battles, have live footage and interviews with those who were there and then compelling modern underwater footage of the Arizona and Ballard's expedition to find the Yorktown's final resting place.  (which they do).  Every patriotic American should see Pearl Harbor and the Battle for Midway.  The first will bring a tear to your eye, the second will make you proud.  Pearl is the Japanese sucker punch and Midway is our payback!

I give 4 stars because the third DVD just didn't do much for me.  The trilogy would have been better as a dual disk set.  Please know though that Pearl and Midway are first rate and make the collection worthwhile and very nice to have.  Consider the third DVD to just be a ""bonus track"".",1198281600,13,1346,4.639830508474576
1413717,3,B00005AAEI,"I can't find captions or subtitles anywhere on this DVD, and I've looked a number of times. There's no caption symbol or mention of them on the DVD cover, so I can only assume they're just not there. This is a particular shame given that the DVD is otherwise so excellent, and this is inexcusable in this day and age. I would give the content 5 stars, but I have to mark my rating down to 3 for this apparent omission.

On a different note, I also wish the DVD came with an update on the search for the minisubs, which I find intriguing. The inside view of the Arizona was amazing, with the officer's desk, papers and items still perfectly in place, was striking.",1187913600,4,663,4.304

1413719,4,B00005AAEI,"I got this video as a part of a three DVD National Geographic set of WWII related topics.  What interested me the most about this video was the combination of original film with elderly veterans giving a first person account of what they experienced at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  There is a third aspect to this DVD having to do with a modern underwater search for a sunken Japanese mini-sub.  There were times that this story was somewhat interesting but mostly it interfered with the rest of the program.  As I understand it, this search was the reason that the National Geographic took on this project.  If so, I guess this documentary had to give that search SOME coverage.  However, I would have preferred more of the interviews and the the original film of the attack and its' aftermath.  History is presented well in ""Pearl Harbor; Legacy of Attack"" and it is aided by the excellent narration of Tom Brokaw.  Overall I give this DVD a ""4.5""  but it could have been a ""5"".",1110499200,5,986,4.556818181818182
1413720,5,B00005AAEI,"Robert Ballard's search for the Japanese sub fired upon by the Ward an hour before the attack on Pearl Harbor and the promise of the first look inside the sunken USS Arizona may be the featured selling points for this wonderful National Geographic special, but it is the personal stories of Pearl Harbor survivors that makes this a moving, incredibly rewarding video experience.  This special, hosted by Tom Brokaw, was filmed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the reprehensible sneak attack, and it is definitely one of the most impressive Pearl Harbor documentaries I have seen.

The video deals almost as much with the present as it does the past, switching back and forth between then and now in a pattern which basically takes you through the overall sequence of events on the day that will forever live in infamy.  Personally, I could have done with much less footage of Ballard's search for the Japanese midget sub; it's certainly interesting, but the search fails to provide us with any important new information.  The footage taken by robotic vehicles from inside the Arizona was also interesting; this was, after all, the first time the interior of the ill-fated battleship has been seen since the morning of December 7, 1941.

I won't quibble very much about the description and footage of the attack.  Obviously, this one video could not go into all of the tragic events of that day, but it does offer a good overview of the situation, does great honor to those who died that Sunday morning as well as those who survived, and gives mention to several facts that aren't mentioned all that often - e.g., the fact that a sub was spotted approaching Pearl Harbor four hours before the attack (and three hours before a second sub was sighted and fired upon by the Ward).  It also describes the senseless positioning of naval forces on that morning, making US ships and planes sitting ducks to the overpowering air attack.  It does not go so far as to cast blame or ask who knew what in advance, but it does drive home the point that Japanese forces gave themselves away three times in the hours preceding the attack, but no action of any kind was taken by anyone on Oahu.  It should not be a secret by now, of course, that the depth of the disaster that day had as much to do with American military incompetence as it did the actual Japanese attack.

The heart of Pearl Harbor, though, is the stories of the victims and the survivors, and this documentary does a great service to all those young men and women.  Personal stories of bravery, such as that of Dorie Miller, are told, but these are far surpassed in emotional terms by a number of personal stories of victims - these are stories some men carried with them for decades, and few can relate them now without shedding tears of horror and heartbreak.  One survivor had come to Pearl Harbor for the first time in six decades, finally opening up and telling his story because he knew he had only a few months to live.  All of those men who suffered and died must never be forgotten, and they must never be relegated to mere numbers.  Hearing the personal stories of survivors, no matter how horrible the things they describe witnessing, brings the importance of every individual soul lost that fateful day into the proper perspective.  I daresay there are very few men and women who can watch this National Geographic special without becoming emotional themselves - it is a powerful presentation that I think every American should see.",1102464000,10,3504,4.693311582381729
1413721,5,B00005AAEI,"Nobody who has been to Pearl Harbor and the 'Arizona' memorial is untouched by the experience. I had always wanted to visit it since I was a child, and finally did so in 2002. Even after all the planning and anticipation, it was still far more emotional and moving that I could have imagined. This DVD is like that, too, although on a smaller scale. Even if you have read about Pearl Harbor, this documentary still has the power to draw tears to the eyes of viewers.
The DVD is multifaceted. In part it showcases Bob Ballard and his quest for a Japanese midget sub. That is interesting enough, but that isn't the real attraction of the documentary. The more important part of the film are images of the December 7, 1941 attack, the haunting footage of the 'Arizona' as she is now (including unbelievable interior shots), and most powerfully of all, the interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors. There are also some interactive maps, a behind the scenes feature and extended survivor interviews as bonus features.
I really must emphasize the importance of the survivor interviews. These interviews are unstructured, and they tell the audience what they think is important. It is all important. I can't imagine that anyone can listen to these men recount their experiences without feeling a huge debt of gratitude to them. They are true American heroes. This DVD is about sacrifice and the things that are good about the United States. It is hard to watch what they went through, but it is important that we never forget.
Buy this DVD and remember the lessons of Pearl Harbor.",1089244800,7,1572,4.761904761904762
1413722,5,B00005AAEI,"This video does an excellent job of telling the story of the Pearl Harbor Attack by using actual footage as well as testimonials of survivors.  Again, National Geographic has solicited the help of Dr. Robert Ballard in hopes of finding a sunken Japanese midget submarine which tried to enter the harbor during the attack.  Dr. Ballard has been featrued in other National Geographic videos dealing with the search for the U.S.S. Yorktown, the German Battleship Bismarck, and the ships of Ironbottom Sound.  I own all of these other videos and I particularly enjoy Ballard's approach to finding sunken ships, so I was anxious to see how he would do in his search for the Japanese submarine.  Survivors of the U.S.S. Ward, an American destroyer on patrol on December 7, 1941, are interviewed in this video.  Their ship was the actual one which fired on and sank the sub that Ballard is searching for.  I have always enjoyed the way that National Geographic has blended together the actual war footage along with the stories of the survivors, and this video keeps up the tradition.  Perhaps my favorite part of this video was seeing the first images taken from inside the U.S.S. Arizona.  It was really someting special to see.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone who enjoys underwater adventures as well as Pearl Harbor readers/viewers.",1020211200,27,1344,4.911504424778761
