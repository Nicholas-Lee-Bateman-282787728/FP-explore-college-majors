2486924,1,B000E3LD68,I think this dvd is great I saw Jonny A in New York and was blown away by his guitar playing. This dvd helps you to understand the man's approach to his music. The camera shots are great and the sound is perfect. A great DVD for the guitar fanatic.,1168560000,,248,3.98
2486925,5,B000E3LD68,"There is no one like Johnny A. I never travel far without his music in my car or on my IPod. I play him at public events and am always asked ""Who is this?"" And I say, ""The best guitarist...ever."" I'm old enough to have seen Duane Eddy, Bucky Pizzarelli, Hendrix, Clapton, the Ventures (with Bob Bogle and Nokie Edwards sharing lead), Wes Montgomery, Alvin Lee,  Jerry Miller, Peter Green, and Neil LaVange (Yes!  From Lawrence Welk [also a session musician for  Zappa's ""Freak Out""--the Mothers first record]), and dozens of other masters. But Johnny A, in honoring his muses, does them proud by creating melodic, dynamic and performance master themes and nuances that free guitar music from the gravity of  the joyless, luckless club of speed and one-upmanship which obsess most guitarists. Johnny A conjures what William Wordsworth would call the ""lyric moment,"" where the emotion conjured by the poet profound, conjures an emotion profound in the listener. He'll get your pulse running with a ripp-off riff and then macrame harmonic tones and unusually carved melodies around themes that build on previous subtle nuances that explode the form and create anew something original and memorable. I've seen him live four times and he is even greater in person. And you can tell he's a humble student of his instrument. He stands by himself as the master of tone and never shortchanges his music by making room tone a cursory acoustic of the room. He's also a lot of fun live, invoking a medley of styles and stances and doing it with humor and respect. This instructional video is well conceived and honors anyone who wants to study guitar. Johnny A is articulate, patient and unabashedly enthusiastic about guitar instruction. It's a great and unusually detailed DVD for any level of guitar playing.",1162598400,15,1799,4.927392739273928
2486926,5,B000E3LD68,"I ordered this dvd after seeing it mentioned on FDP. I buy a few dvds and this is one of the better ones. THis guy is excellent and crosses into a few different styles from Chet to blues.  Really liked the printable tabs and all the bonus material.  After watching it, ordered his cd's and a book. I would compare it to EJ's dvd's in what you'll get from watching. Just great guitar work that you can pick up and play yourself.  Hope that he brings a few more out.",1147910400,16,464,4.133333333333334
2486927,1,B000E3LD68,"""U.S. and Canada only""

So no need to market it to me in Europe !",1145750400,2,65,3.3333333333333335
2486937,5,B000E3LD68,What a remarkable guitar player!  I wish he would put out more CD's and DVD's.  He has his own style of playing that is just phenomenal.  I haven't heard him play anything I didn't like so far.,1386460800,,193,4.162162162162162
2486938,5,B000E3LD68,All I can say is ....more please !! Awesome video  Awesome player ! I love the format of the question answer dialogue in this video.,1377561600,,132,4.28
2486939,5,B000E3LD68,A great performance and a great lesson on the art of modern jazz guitar.  Johnny A is a true natural guitarist.,1372809600,,111,4.285714285714286
2486940,4,B000E3LD68,"for the first few minutes the audio and video are out of sync, but in all it worked out to be okay",1371513600,,98,3.5
2486941,5,B000E3LD68,"Johnny A.and his band run through some classic pieces from Johnny's two albums, ""Sometime Tuesday Morning"" & ""Get Inside"".
Following each selection, Johnny sits down with guitarist/instructor Aaron Stang for breakdowns of how each tune is constructed.
The DVD is set up so that you also have the option of viewing just the performance, as well as chapter breakdowns, tablature embedded in the disc, and a special section where Johnny discusses his style, influences & his equipment, including his amazing signature model Gibson guitar, who's good looks are surpassed only by it's amazing tone.

Bonus performances are included from Robben Ford and an amazing country chickin' pickin' performance by Albert Lee.

Entertaining and informative. 5 stars.",1250553600,,750,5.456896551724138
2486942,5,B000E3LD68,"It is one thing to play the guitar well and, indeed, very well in the case of Johnny A. It is quite another to be able to talk about one's playing without coming across as preachy or pedantic. Johnny A. talks simply and with some inspiring axe handling to back him up so that the guitar player and/or enthusiast comes away from this DVD understanding the guitar a little better.",1238803200,4,378,4.414285714285715
2486943,5,B000E3LD68,"I've listened to Johhny ever since ""Oh Yeah"" started to play on the radio out here. I've always liked him  and I thought both CDs were equally good. But then I went on a trip down to New Orleans and Mississippi. I got some quality time along I-35 and it finally took hold, took my breath away and ever since, I can't get enough of him. Now that I have a visual, it's helping with my addiction. Since I live in Colorado, I don't get to see him live, however, I'm hoping he'll make a western swing soon.

This DVD is excellent. The eight songs he chose to perform are some of his best. The audio could've been just a little better but mostly, it sounds pretty decent. ""Two Wheel Horse"" is great (the song that hooked me) but the real surprise was ""You Don't Love Me."" Not only does he completely change it up, but the solo is unbelievable. ""Sometime Tuesday Morning"", of course ""Oh Yeah"" and many every other song are wonderful.

A new CD would be great and a national tour would be really welcome. Come west Johnny and play Red Rocks!!!",1213488000,3,1035,4.297435897435897
2486944,5,B000E3LD68,"This guitar player is amazing. Excellent DVD including explanations about how to play the songs etc. A ""must"" for every guitar player",1202428800,,133,5.090909090909091
2486945,5,B000E3LD68,"Here you get very well-made videos, with perfect audio, of Johnny A. playing eight songs.  If you have ever seen this guitar magician play, you know that alone makes this DVD well worth more than the purchase price.  In between songs, Johnny is interviewed about techniques used in the songs.  Bonus stuff includes printable tablature for six of the songs, info on the Gibson Johnny A. signature guitar, and performances by Robben Ford and Albert Lee.  What's not to love?",1194307200,4,472,4.8625
2486946,5,B000E3LD68,"""Taste, Tone, Space"" -That says it all right there. Johnny A. is a master. I'd buy this DVD for the excellent performances alone. I love the format; first you get the full tune performed by Johnny and his band, which looks and sounds great. Then it's broken down part by part. DVD includes PDF files of all the notation/tab. Great stuff, can't beat the price either. Don't hesitate, you'll love it!",1176076800,2,398,4.619718309859155
