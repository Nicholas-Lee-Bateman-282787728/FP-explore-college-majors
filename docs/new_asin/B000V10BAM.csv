It does not read in USA DVD machines..it is not advertised as a foreign (PAL) disc...I am upset also because I bought it 2 months ago and just opened box and tried to play it...so it is too late for me to return it...Not happy..
It MUST be listed properly....",1446163200,3,326,4.09375
8216142,5,B000V10BAM,"Nanni Moretti is the director and actor in 3 short but combined movies which add up to 'Dear Diary'. He does what we all do. He lives his life and we find that similar to our own experiences what appears mundane and boring can be funny and entertaining. One reviewer describes it as 'wry'. I'd say that's the perfect description. Moretti on a Vespa, Moretti dancing to a commercial, Moretti on a boat, Moretti scratching ........it's cute and utterly compelling. One of my favorite movies and I really have to buy another copy!!",1383696000,,528,4.688172043010753
8216143,3,B000V10BAM,"In the description of the product, it says that the DVD region is set to All regions. Unfortunately it is not true. The DVD I received was set to Region 2 (Europe).

My north amercian DVD player won't play it, but I found out that VLC media player is able to play it in the computer, without changing the DVD Region of your DVD-ROM.

At least I can play it now.

The quality of the video transfer is quite bad, but it is better than the old recorded VHS I had of the movie. You don't have control over the subtitles, but at least you have them.

In all, it is quite a bad DVD edition, but it is still good to watch Caro Diario.",1341532800,2,627,3.992
8216144,5,B000V10BAM,"This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. It is full of small funny moments and watching it with a group of friends its as if someone is going around the room tickling people as they begin to laugh.

It is a very Italian movie and the humor maybe too local to be generally accessible but the look at the medical system with its tendency to over prescribe pills, to the island where children are the bosses, this is a very funny look at life in Italy at a specific time and place.",1263772800,4,494,4.092783505154639
8216145,3,B000V10BAM,"What is it all about? If not being a semi-biography of a later cancer-fighter, this work is just a comedy of a boyish bearded man on a motorbike hanging around Rome and Europe with no sexual commitment/interplay as nice music followed his any motion.

Well, perhaps, it will worth more as a semi-doco over a few decades oncoming.",1212796800,2,329,4.672413793103448
