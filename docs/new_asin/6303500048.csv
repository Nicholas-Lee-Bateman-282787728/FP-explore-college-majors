  The movie is about a man who meets a woman in a bar.  He  helps her escape from a man, and ends up getting intimate with her on the  roof of the building.  She pulls away and leaves him without any phone  number or address.  Fortunately, they meet again at the airport.
  The man begins to have an intimate affair with the woman.  The affair  continues, but a suggestion pulls them apart from each other.  The woman  suggests that he kill her husband in exchange to kill his wife.  The man  thinks that she is making a sick joke, and he doesn't take it seriously.
  He knows she isn't joking when his wife's truck turns up in a river.  The woman had to be a part of it.  The woman calls him and tells him to do  the same for him.  He refuses to do so and tells her to get out of his  life.  She tries to convince him constantly, but he still disagrees.  Finally, she convinces him to plot the murder of their husband.
  The plot seems perfect, until it goes awry.  When it was time to finally  kill her husband, things didn't go as planned.  In the process, he lost  something that could be evidence to prove that he was the killer.  Later,  he finds out that he has been brought into a web of seduction, deception,  and murder.
  The plot thickens after this and twists and turns will  lurk around every corner.  Although this movie is suspenseful, it does have  many scenes of sexuality, one which is strong.  There is not as much  nudity, but still much sexual activity.
  I would recommend this movie  and another that was similar to this one.  The movie was called Body Heat.  In it, Kathleen Turner stars as a deceitful woman who seduces a man into  murdering her husband.  It is more erotic, suspenseful, and taut.",966643200,4,1880,4.319767441860465
