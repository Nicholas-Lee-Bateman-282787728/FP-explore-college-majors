The dvd version of all 3 films run longer than their vhs counterparts. So instead of finding the vhs, find the dvd. All 3 films are much longer and make much more sense storywise. You could even say they are UNCUT. Part 1 alone made way more sense in it's entirety.",1516147200,,389,4.131578947368421

500475,3,6302722764,"The Lost martial arts classic No retreat No surrender from 1986
Jean claude van Damme's first Theatrical mainstream film is on blu-ray by Kino Lorber
tragically the HD transfer is terrible i would rate it about 4/10
the picture quality still has lots of Grain in it similar to VHS quality actually but widened to 1:85:1 ratio
looks like Kino Lorber didn't make any effort cleaning up the picture quality at all
there's 2 versions of the film on 1 Disc the U.S. 85min & the Longer 94min version, both versions have the same 1:85:1 HD transfer
pathetic effort by Kino Lorber they should be a shamed of themselves
however they did make some effort with the sound quality with new 2.0 master stereo mix
and Kino made the effort with new extras
a new interview with Actor Kurt McKinney & new audio commentary by the screen writer of the film
plus the original Theatrical trailer in standard quality and stills Gallery
Kino Lorber also reissued the film on dvd with the same extras, so cause of the terrible HD transfer the blu-ray is not worth buying
so better to save money and buy the dvd reissue just for the new extras
so i give 2-3 stars for this new blu-ray reissue for the new extras but terrible HD transfer",1503360000,,1210,4.504545454545455

a few fine scratches are visible in the start and trough-out the film.
this is the best release by far as it includes both international and U.S. cuts.
bonus features include various trailers of other films,also includes a very interesting interview with actor/star Kurt McKinney.
this blu ray is the best version compared to whats out there, including both australian and german releases.",1488153600,7,559,5.153846153846154
500577,3,6302722764,"No Retreat,No Surrender(released May/86)stars,among others,Kurt McKinney, J.W. Fails and Jean Claude Van Damme. This was Van Damme's third only film,having done two others starting from /79. It was also the one that was just before Bloodsport,which would launch JCVD's career for good.
The story finds McKinney as a Karate student at his father's establishment in L.A.One day a group of thugs who want to take control over all the martial arts schools in L.A.,drop by for a visit. They put the pressure on his dad who caves, by closing the school and moving his family to Seattle(JVCD is one of the visiting thugs- a Russian).In Seattle McKinney establishes a new life,which includes a girlfriend. However an associate at a Karate school he attends muscles in on he and his girl, and ends up humiliating him at a party. He first goes to Bruce Lee's grave(whom he worships)to ask for advice. Then it's off to home where his Dad and he get into an argument ,which leads to his father throwing all his fitness equipment in the garage out into the driveway. He later comes back with a friend to take away his stuff and set it up in a garage in an empty house. He falls asleep and is awakened by Bruce Lee's spirit, who from then on teaches him all he needs to know about Karate.
The film's finale takes place in an arena where the best of the Karate school go up against punks from the gang who put the hustle on McKinney's father in L.A..They are there to win and take control of Karate schools in Seattle. Before the fight commences the gang leader informs to crowd that JCVD alone will take on all three. As predicted he puts a beating on the team. When McKinney's girlfriend comes to the aid of her brother and gets pushed away, McKinney is up and into Jean Claude's face. There are American flags on the walls,and even the ropes are red,white and blue. It's good vs evil. The final bell rings and it's McKinney the victor over the bad Russian.
This is a cheap movie, made with a majority of seemingly cheap/first timer actors. Jean Claude at least gives us a good show as the menacing Red. Other than that it's strictly amateur time from the rest. There are two versions of the film here, and the American one is by far the better cut. The International one is fleshed out too much and makes for slower action. The two swap alternate and cut scenes with the latter coming in a bit longer than the former. Of course this film plays on Rocky Four where Stallone(red,white and blue)takes on Russian Lundgren. This is the only JCVD film that I know of where he,by himself,plays the bad guy.
Technically speaking the films are clear and crisp and in their original a/r of 1:85:1. Extras include commentary on the American version,the International trailer and an interview with McKinney done recently by Kino Lorber. Both first reels are a bit grainy.
All in all a film for JCVD collectors only. I'd like to thank Kino Lober for making it possible. It is of its time and the acting overall is  poor,especially evident in the International version. JCVD is only in the film twice;once at the beginning and in the finale. The American version doesn't make it seem so long between appearances,but the other makes it seem like forever. 2 1/2 stars.",1487980800,,3240,4.6055363321799305

500585,5,6302722764,"Finally, I have been waiting for this to hit Blu Ray for quite some time now. I always would catch this on HBO as they would air it, and enjoy it on VHS for many years. I tried streaming the International Version, however i was very disappointed with the added scenes and music changes enjoyed on the U.S. version. Thankfully Kino Lorber has done us a huge favor and is releasing both versions on this BluRay. As we know the film follows Karate Student Jason Stillwell (Kurt Mckinney) and his family, Kurt's dad owns a karate dojo in California, and is being forced to use his business as a front for drug smugglers, Naturally he refuses and receives a broken leg, by the enforcer of the smugglers, Ivan the Russian (played awesomely by Jean Claude Van Damme). So he sells the business and moves his family to Seattle. Jason then becomes the punching bag for the local bullies, and also becomes friends with local resident RJ. While all this is going on, jason has a fight with dad, who doesn't believe in unnecessary fighting, jason runs out of the garage when dad rips up Jason's prized Bruce Lee poster, Lee who is buried in Seattle becomes the trainer in spirit form after Jason asks him for help in dealing with the bully situation. Lee, appears and agrees to teach only for self defense. Meanwhile the bullies make their way to Seattle to challenge the local dojo owned by Ian Reilly. Reilly's camp consists of the same bullies that have been tormenting Jason, especially since Jason is seeing Ian's sister Kelly. After Ivan the Russian reappears during the fight and systematically destroys Reilly's fighters, Jason comes to the rescue and destroys Ivan using Leedaka's training(Sensei Lee). This is a great movie and fun just for the fight scenes. Grab it before it disappears.",1483574400,,1785,4.7243589743589745

500846,5,6302722764,"Does everybody remember the scene in ""Back to the Future"" where George McFly goes into the malt shop to ask Lorraine out on a date? Do we all remember how exaggerated he acts - because he's so nervous - the wild arms waving, the absurd intensity in the way he speaks his lines?

Now imagine an entire cast acting and speaking that way throughout the whole film, and you have imagined the ""acting"" on display in ""No Retreat, No Surrender"", Hong Kong director Corey Yuen's first English-language film, and the flick that introduced the world to - as my college buddy would say it, raising his voice and pronouncing the words very slowly and distinctly - JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME.  Both of them managed to survive this, but you may wonder how after seeing it.

At the beginning of the film, we find one Tom Stilwell (Timothy D. Baker - like most of the principal actors here, a martial artist who shows little if any aptitude for playing a character) running a dojo in California. He teaches martial arts as a defensive tool - not as a means for attack - but his philosophy is tested when the Mob decides to take over his establishment, on their way to presumably controlling all of the enormously lucrative martial arts businesses in rundown areas in western cities...but I digress.  This is our first opportunity to see JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME who plays a bad guy here, Ivan the Russian; he quickly beats the crap out of Tom and shows up his son Jason (Kurt McKinney) as well.

Cut to a few weeks later, as the Stilwells have moved to Seattle. Tom's leg is crippled and so he tends bar; Jason meanwhile makes friends with R.J. (J.W. Fails), apparently the only black kid in the neighborhood and the only male under 25 uninterested in martial arts in the whole city. Alas RJ has a nemesis in the portly Scott (Kent Lipham) who hates him - and then hates Jason - for no reason whatsoever, and tries to make their lives miserable. Jason wants to be a Jedi - er, a karate expert - like his father, but he gets nowhere when he joins the local dojo - because somehow out-of-shape Scott is a member in good standing and gets him kicked out, I guess - this wasn't clear, and I didn't care. Eventually, though, Jason will come to a true understanding of the spiritual power of martial arts through ... the spirit of Bruce Lee (Tai Chung Kim)! Which is a good thing, since we have to have at least one more scene with second-billed JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME - but only one, and it's at the very end, so if that's all you want to see, just the first 10 and last 10 minutes will suffice.

But you would be missing some of the very worst acting by an entire ensemble cast to ever grace - or disgrace - a film.  ""Mac and Me"" bad.  ""Plan 9 From Outer Space bad"". There's a scene where Tom is yelling at Jason, and Jason turns away, gesticulates wildly, and yells at Tom behind his back. There's the first meeting of Jason and RJ, both of them smiling like idiots and instantly bonding in a ... uh ... shall we say, overly friendly way while Jason unloads the family car and the cheesiest 80s electronic soundtrack music ever plays. There's JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME with maybe 8 words - but 8 words that sound like he'd learned English phonetically just the previous day - in the whole film.  And finally, there's the constant over-exaggeration of nearly every phrase uttered by everybody in the whole film, as if they think they're talking to mildly deaf people.

It's not just the acting or music though - there are narrative lapses, like the one female character who is suddenly introduced as Jason's (potential?) girlfriend, out of nowhere, and who then disappears for an hour, unmentioned. There's the aforementioned Scott and his odd hatred of R.J. for no reason at all - R.J. is black, but there's never a hint of racism or racial differences anywhere in the story, which I guess could be said to be to the credit of the film, except it's just weird in the context of the plotline. There's the fact that all the fat people in the film are really evil; there's the Mob's crazy dojo power-grab; there's the fact that R.J. isn't into martial arts and yet follows Jason into the dressing room to watch him change...and the two are basically inseparable throughout the film. There's the Bruce Lee thing - Jason needs to get better at karate, the spirit of Bruce shows up, nobody else can see him - but Jason not only gets better, nobody questions him as to how he's training alone in an abandoned house all night long...and, well, best not to go on trying to think about it too much.

Decent martial arts, but atrocious acting, an idiotic story, awful music, cheesy outfits, mediocre direction, and just plain incompetence on most levels all add up to one of the most entertaining awful movies I've seen in a while. Trying to rate films like this is always tough; let's just say that the OK action might *almost* keep it from a 1-star rating - but if you're a bad movie aficionado, this is closer to the other end of the scale.  And that's where I'm putting it, because it makes me laugh just to think about it for a second.",1380326400,2,5097,4.480603448275862

500993,4,6302722764,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

I don't think anyone who starred in this movie made it big, outside of Jean-Claude Van Damme.  It was one of several inferior knock-offs of the ""Karate Kid"" concept to be churned out during the mid-1980's, and in spite of everything holds its own as an entertaining B movie.

Concerning the story of one Jason Stillwell, it follows the spirited young martial artist on the expected journey of self-empowerment.  In this case, both Jason and his father receive humiliating beatings in their own dojo to start the movie, and promptly move away.  It's worth mentioning that doing the beating is Jean-Claude Van Damme, in what is, I think, one of his first visible roles.  Though Russian political communism was about to die, it was still safe in 1986 to villify the Russian strongman as evil.  I think this was a tired stereotype even then, and Van Damme is not in reality Russian, though the filmmakers still manage to get some mileage out of this scenario.

Additionally, instead of Mr. Miyagi hanging around to pull Jason up by his bootstraps, this movie features a supernatural version of Bruce Lee.  I appreciate the surrealistic twist, and the actor playing the departed Mr. Lee does an admirable job.

This will never be mentioned as a great movie by any stretch, but its power is that it doesn't try to be anything other than what it is.  It is a reminder that the B movie can, in fact, be very entertaining.

P.S. SPOILER Van Damme actually loses in the end, but because he's the bigger star, he's on the DVD packaging.",1265414400,2,1542,4.691449814126394

Only the enthusiasts know why, but what everybody ought to know is that the original outing is certainly worth tracking down for fans of cheesy 80s nonsense and awesome kung fu.

The story: Jason Stillwell (Kurt McKinney, ""General Hospital"") is the Bruce Lee-idolizing son of a karate master who is forced out of his dojo by a crime syndicate backed by a powerful Russian martial artist named Ivan Kraschinsky (Van Damme,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>). After relocating from LA to Seattle, Jason finds himself humiliated at every turn by a community determined to make him miserable; but when all seems lost, he's visited by the ghost of Bruce Lee, who offers him personal instruction to become the martial artist he'll need to be to survive both bullies and a returning Ivan.

Jut by reading that summary, you ought to get a feeling of how undoubtedly weird this movie is. It's my belief that director Yuen used this film as a kind of creative outlet for everything he had wanted to put into a film: I think he took all the cool ideas that he hadn't been able to utilize in other movies, coupled with everything he thought was hip in the US at the time, and threw them all together amidst some cool fight scenes. That, at least, would explain the presence of Bruce Lee's ghost (played by former stand-in to the real Lee, Tai Chung Kim), the nonsensical and completely useless disco scene in which Jason's strange friend RJ (J.W. Fails) dresses like Michael Jackson, and the overall 80s-in-overdrive feeling that permeates the movie. Very, very bad acting from everybody involved is further offset by illogical exchanges (""Don't worry; I'm nobody's lunch!"") and a general feeling of everything in life revolving in one way or another around martial arts.

Of course, the martial arts in question certainly are worth devoting attention to: there are about six real fights in the movie, and despite not being Corey Yuen's best work, they go to show why the director is one of the best there is when it comes to what he does. To list them chronologically, Jason's father (karate champion Timothy Baker) fights an invading thug and Van Damme, McKinney is confronted by Peter Cunningham (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>) in a one-sided but very technical exhibition match, Jason and his father take on a group of alley thugs wherein McKinney really begins to shine with some awesome kicks, a series of three fights wherein Van Damme takes on Dale Jacoby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Fire/dp/B000094FE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Fire</a>), Cunningham, and tang soo do expert Ron Pohnel (the third of which is probably the best fight of the movie), and the final emotional confrontation between McKinney and Van Damme. I don't think it's an exaggeration to claim that prior to this movie, most Americans had never experienced kung fu quite like this; even though some fights aren't as fun as others, the collection is about as good as it gets for this kind of show, Van Damme's full leg splits included.

Whether or not you should be interested in buying the film depends on your tolerance of cinematic cheese and whether or not you're willing to accept it, either as a complementary side or a grain of salt, alongside the action scenes. Rest assured, ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" has earned its cult status many times over, but unless you're willing to grasp the significance of all of the film's flaws and strengths as a cumulative package, you ought to look somewhere else for you kicks (and punches).",1248048000,8,4835,5.824858757062147

501029,5,6302722764,"No Retreat No Surrender is a classic martial arts movie from the 80s.  It's classic because it follows the 80s formula of ""screw it, put it in there, people will enjoy it regardless of how unbelievable it is"".

The movie ""stars"" a runt named Jason (Kurt McKinney), who looks like the guy perpetually gets his lunch money stolen.  All is well in his sheltered life until one day he skips into his father's dojo just in time to see his father getting a beatdown from a Russian mobster henchman named Ivan (Jean Claude Van Damme).  Evidently, the Sherman Oaks Karate School is prime gangster real estate, and the Russian syndicate simply must have it.

After his dad gets a can of ***-whoopin' from Ivan, and a broken leg, the family is forced to move to Seattle to regain any semblance of pride.  It's in Seattle that Jason meets RJ, a black guy who wears a jheri curl to distract others from seeing how lame he really is.  But, hey!  He can breakdance, and he sure can dribble a basketball while riding a bicycle like it's nobody's business!

Anyway, Jason and RJ get bullied by karate thugs, and afterwards Jason is visited by Bruce Lee's ghost.  (seriously)  Lucky for Jason, it's just in time to meet up with Ivan, who is yet again applying a beating to an unprepared opponent.  This time, however, Jason has had a few months of training behind him and is more than prepared for the final battle.

The final battle is classic.  And by classic I mean most atrocious choreography for a fight scene in movie history.  There is one bright side, and that is the fact that we get to see the genesis of Jean Claude Van Damme's patented move: the splits.  Jason uses it on him during the fight with deadly effectiveness, and JCVD hasn't forgotten the lesson to this day.

I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  Watch it for the laughs, the bad acting, and the beginning of the phenomenon known as Jean Claude Van Damme.",1210809600,,1919,4.52906976744186

The movie stars Kurt McKinney as a wimp named Jason whose dad gets beaten up by a Russian guy named Ivan, played by Van Damme. His family move to Seattle where he gets pushed around by a group of karate bullies. Just when he thinks he can never learn karate, Bruce Lee's ghost appears to him and turns him into a fighting machine. In the meantime, the Russian arrives to fight for a championship against the karate bullies...and the rest is history.

No Retreat No Surrender is one of those movies that connects me to my past childhood years. I watched this movie so many times when I was younger that I felt persuaded to revisit it with a purchase and this review!

501059,4,6302722764,"I remember seeing this movie long time back , maybe when i was 15 or something..and since then i was immediatley hooked.

Yes , it is old , yet it is so good and has a simple and an attracting plot .

I used to have an old version of this movie , i remember i got it from my uncle , it was on the BETAMAX video.(of course now it does not exist).

So i went back and bought a new version on VHS , but i was surprised as there were many differet points between this copy and the old copy i used to have.

First , there were many deleted scenes as well as many added secenes that i don't recall seeing them.

for example , one deleted scene i remember was when JASON meets his girlfriend for the first time in his house and his mother tells him that shes here to meet him , i guess she was a friend of his even before the movie have started , i remember also that they go out for shopping together and jason notices that she likes rabbbits , hence he bought it for her in her birthday.

This scene was deleted in my newer copy.

As for the added scenes , i never remember the scene when the newyork mob gang visit RILY in his club and threaten him as well , also in the final fight between jason and van damme , in my older version jason didn't recall what bruce lee taught him during the fight , while in the newer version i found that the fight was inturrepted many times by recollections of jason to what LEE has taught him . !!

Secondly , the music score and the soundtrack was much different between my older version and the newer version , the older version i had , had much better music to it , more moderen and exciting and fast paste , while the newer version had what seemed as cheezy very old music!!!

So does any one why these differences between the two copies??? i would really love it if someone knows how many versions on VHS are there for this movie??? and how many editing process did this movie have???

501060,5,6302722764,"This film is a severely underated cult classic.  The acting is bad but the one liners are instant classics.  The basis of the story is the New York mob want to take over Jason's dad dojo but Mr. Stillwell refuses to join the crime syndicate and ends up with a broken leg (but the cast only goes up to the shin.)  Once having arrived in Seattle from L.A. Mr. Srillwell finds work as a bartender at The Brig a bar where its illegal for anyone under 2 to be served and also no dogs are allowed (they must've had very strict laws back then) Jason fast becomes friends with a kid named RJ ""check me out dudes"" Madison whos skills of dribbling a basketball while riding a bike go unmatched to this day.  RJ has his own problems with the local bully named Scott who ""has his reasons"" for not liking RJ.  A classic scene between Scott and RJ happens when we see RJ just aimlessly wondering around the local burger time parking lot but *looks surprised* when surrounded by Scott and his friends.  Jason one day decides enroll at the local dojo run by Ian ""whirlwind"" Reilly but the day Jason decides to enroll back up instructor Dean ""shooting star"" Ramsay is filling in.  Dean is told by Scott (watch his facial expressions) that he had a run in with Jason who was talking about how bad Seattle karate is and was  putting down Seattle karate in a big way and talking about how wonderful Los Angeles karate is. Jason is further humiliatted at Kelly's b' day party by Dean (Kelly btw is Ian's little sister) after informing Kelly that they are ""old pals"" Dean tells Jason ""stay out of the way punk shes mine"" and after telling Dean to back off Jason is thrashed by Dean and while Jason is in a choke hold Dean says ""hear that PUNK she knows whos the best"".  Jason quickly finds refuge at the grave of Bruce Lee Jason begs Bruce Lee to help him ""I NEED help Sensei Lee you have to help me  Sensei Lee I've no place else to go no one but you no one but you"".  After arriving home the following exchange happens

Mr. Stillwell: Where you been?

Jason: Nowhere

Mr. Stillwell: I asked where you were

Jason: and I told didn't I

Mr. Stillwell: I'll pretend I didn't hear that

Jason: Suit yourself I'll pretend I didn't say it

This leads to Mr. Stillwell trashing out the garage (what should've been done long ago) after telling Jason until then you do as I say clear.  Jason goes mental after his dad rips a poster of Bruce Lee off the wall and runs to RJ's.  Fear not though RJ provides transportation and knows of an abandoned house near by. After settling in Jason witnesses the controversial second coming of Bruce Lee ""Lee Da Gar you call me"" (whose appearance and dubbing have changed since we last saw him)  After what seems like two weeks of training Jason's first challenge is to take on 4 bar thugs that have bullied Jason's dad afterwards Jason and dad become closer than ever.  Moving back slightly Ian has his own problems with the same crime syndicate that had a run in with Jason's dad earlier in the film (don't the mob have better things to do then takeover small karate dojos) and this sets up the climax at the first full contact karate exhibition match between Seattle and NY.  The NY syndicate unleashes its secret weapon Ivan ""the butcher"" Ivan has no problem making light work of the first two Dean and Frank he however has trouble with Ian and the following exchange happens Ivan doesn't talk

NY agent (the guy with his hair slicked back) What are you doing? get him kill him

after Ivan gets kicked in the face by Ian this exchange happens

NY agent Take him get him kill him KILL HIM

Ivan goes mad and beats Ian after Ivan grabs Kelly by the hair Jason only then leaps into action a few lines come to mind

Ivan: So it is you the son is it not

Jason But this time it'll be different Russian (Ivan goes berserk)

Ivan: You're good

Jason: I get better

In the end Jason saves the day and Seattle wins.  A damn fine film I watch this at least 2 times a day.  Where does it all end USA vs USSR LA karate vs Seattle karate good vs evil.  There are 2 different versions of this film with 2 different soundtracks (as well as 2 different title songs with different singers) the cut version has a yellow logo and the longer version a red logo.  I have seen the uncut version on F/X I own both the cut and uncut version on dvd as well as the soundtrack. The longer version adds more story.  Where on earth were the oscar nominations for this film?  A true classic in every sense of the word.  I also think there was missed potential with Kurt Mckinney and he could have been a big star but fell below the H'wood radar he is excellent as the lead.  The movie also marks the film debut of Jean-Claude Van Damme as Ivan ""The Butcher"" Kershinski or is simply credited as Karl Berzdin during the end credits.

It hasn't been restored or digitly remastered to well :( but I found it in the cheapie bin for $8 Australian, and seeing as how I remembered seeing it years ago, and also recalling it was Vanne Dammes first movie... I had to get it!
The quality is not great. The sound is 1.0 and terrible. and there is no bonus features...well, except trailers to NRNS 2 + 3 plus King of the kick boxers... but I don't consider trailers any kind of bonus.
After seeing the movie again, and refreshing my memory.. I gotta say... the acting is not great, the movie is pretty well dated, and the plot goes from one thing to the other with no preperation ... but theres just somthign about the movie thats terrific!
Jason is a kid from L.A who's father is a Karate intstructor. His father is asked by a group who are trying to take over all martial arts training dojo's to front for orginized crime.... that bit is kind of corney to me... then Vanne Dammes charactor prooves that Jasons father is no match for him. and the buisness is closed down , and they move to Seattle. Jason is a Bruce Lee fanatic, and learns that Bruce Lee is buried in the Seattle area.... and after a confrentation, he asks for Bruce Lee's help! And wullah, Bruce Lee's ghost comes to train Jason! And Jasons martial arts skills improve from beeing taught by the best!
A great thing about this movie that I have to mention is the way the plot goes from one thing to the other without previous information, but yet, either accidently, or ingeniously able to let you know straight away what has happend! like for exsample, Jason has a girl freind, and he speaks about what they did and how they met previously, without you witnessing any of it... but yet, you understand what had happend before hand very easily! I don't know if there was a great number of deleted scenes? or unshot scenes? But it works out very intresting, and easy to follow and figure out what has been happning! Which like i said, the creators where either geniouses, or accidently did that without knowing?!
The movie is good IMO. And its also the first movie Jean Cluade Vanne Damme appeared in I belive? I don't know why its not available on DVD yet for regoin 1, but its on region 4!
I honestly beleive this is a movie that should be remade! I think with todays advancments, this movie beeing made again would really be worth it, not to say theres anything wrong with this version, but I reckon it would be a movie that should be seen again, and the things that could be done for it would make it incredible!

501105,5,6302722764,"Let's begin this review with a quote from the back of the box this piece of cinematic magic came in:
""Ivan the Russian butcher, who makes mincemeat of everyone, faces off with Jason the kid karate student in a do or die bid over syndicated crime.""
Don't let the fact that the movie has almost nothing to do with the previous statement keep you from feasting on the delights contained in ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" a collaborations of the formidable Yuen brothers, Ng See and (?) Corey!  Yeah, if I were a parent of two boys, I'd probably name them Chow Fa and Larry.
Just to break it down for you, Jason is a ""kid karate student"" with a fondness for tank tops and Bruce Lee.  His father doesn't like him, and neither does anyone else.  That is, until Ivan the Russian (or Karl Breznev, depending on whether you pay attention to the actual movie or the credits...either way, it's Jean Claude Van Damme, who unbelievably outclasses the rest of the talent here) and his slickster mafia handlers from the Big Apple come to take over what was surely an irrestitable tactical prize for the Don....Sherman Oaks Karate School.  After his father gets one of his knees broken (he gets hit in one, but ends up with a cast covering his shin on the other) despite his lecturing that ""Karate is NOT to be used aggressively.""  I guess Ivan (or Karl) doesn't speak english, otherwise he surely would have seen the error in his ways after Jason's Dad's moving litany.  Anyway, he busts his leg, or knee, or shin, or something.  Naturally, Jason's family moves to Washington to start a new life.
Enter RJ, the blackest guy who can breakdance and dribble a basketball like a white guy.  He also wears a Jheri Curl bag on his head at night, which you'll find out right before he procures an abandoned farmhouse for Jason to live in, where Bruce Lee (played by some white guy with an asian name) rises from the dead, and teaches Jason that the key to true martial arts understanding is calisthenics, especially using machines like the ones my grandmother used when she watched ""The Price is Right."" I'm not making this up.
RJ is hated by a fat kid named Scott, who ""has his reasons"" for disliking RJ.  When RJ is aimlessly wandering in a parking lot, Scott's gang chases him, and RJ, who can ""Dance a bit"" and is ""really quick"" thinks on his feet, and to escape the gang pursuing him, jumps into the nearest small area that is completely enclosed by a fence.  Luckily, Jason shows up, and they fight the guys off.
After watching a karate tournament on TV, Jason learns from RJ that the champion has a dojo nearby!  Cool!  Then Jason fills out an application at the speed of light, gets his ... kicked, and runs away.  A bit later, he sees his girlfriend, who is the little sister of the karate champion, but somehow Jason wasn't aware of this when they ""met"" in Sherman Oaks the previous summer.  Sensibile enough, I suppose.  ???
The movie goes on and on, in this same general directionless direction, culminating in a ""final, last-ditch battle of savage proportions.""  Don't miss it!

This film works on so many levels I can't list them all.  NRNS tackles issues such as father-son conflicts, long distance relationships, the effects of moving on a teenagers life, the role of martial arts in society.  Every time you watch this movie I guarentee that you will find a comedy editing error, a hilarious facial expression, a continuity mistake...the possibilities are endless.  So lets examine the movie...where to start??  Possibly with Van Damme who dispays some of the finest acting of his illustrious career in this film.  Jean Claude is so fast in the last fight scene he actually appears to teleport. Or possibly with the real star Kurt McKinney who has the greatest array of sleeveless tops in the business.  Then there's a host of others RJ the comedy black side kick, who can transform into a white guy whenever he has to do a break dancing routine, or Kim Tai Chong who puts in a brave performance as Bruce Lee, overcoming the handicap that he looks nothing like  Bruce.

After 3 humiliations in the order karate club,love,father McKinney who is called Jason asks BRUCE LEE to help him. But there's a problem: Bruce Lee is dead. But there's also a clever director who probably said to the crew: ""Solving this problem is easy for a man like me. We'll take the next Asian guy who walks around here, give him 100 dollars and tell him he's Bruce Lee now."" And so they did. Bruce Lee appears and helps Jason to become a true master.

""One step,  sensei.""  ""This is not Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune DO!  Now get with  the program."") to glaring scene flops (where you see the slice in the  heavybag before jason kicks and breaks it.  The final fight scene where you  can see the other cameraman, and when sensie stillwell gets elbowed in one  leg, and then clutches the other leg claiming that its broken). Throw in  the killer soundtrack,  ""There comes a time...when you face your  battles all alone.  There's no retreat, There's no surrender! ""  What can I say, Awesome!

This movie is pure 80s. It's like a mix between  the Bad News Bears and The Karate Kid. You must see the obese bad guy, the  resurrected Bruce Lee (played by a white guy, I think). The hero (NOT, I  repeat, Van Damme) is a white suburban Joe. Best of all, there's a  breakdancing scene by Joe's sidekick. Gnarly!

R.J.: hip hop nice boy, breakin' master, ""I dance a bit  and I'm really quick.""  Jason: a total puss, but his never give up,  never retreat, never surrender attitude makes him endureing. He also likes  Bruce Lee. ""Yaw, right!""  Jason's dad, Mr. Stillwell: a very  upset man at times, and once he get's going, there ain't no stoppin' him.

Has all the good  lines and does not like R.J. ""I've got my reasons."" I wish I knew  what they were.  The best scene in the movie is during the fight between  Ivan a.k.a. Karl and Ian ""Whirlwind"" Reilly, not the fight but  between rounds. Ivan's ""friend"" gives him a back rub and makes  his ""feelings"" for Ivan known, too bad Ivan is too focused to  notice, poor guy. From the opening scenes we see that he gets very upset  and Ivan bails him out, it's hard to love someone from a distance, my hero.  I told all my friends about this movie for years then I ended up working  at a video store that had it, now everyone loves it, and you will too.

501127,5,6302722764,"No retreat No Surrender is one of the greatest movies of the 20th century, without a doubt. Jason Stillwell is a ""Bruce Lee freak"" and a karate practitioner at his father's Dojo, ""Sherman Oaks Karate.""  The only problem is; as his father puts it, he needs to  "" Get with  the program! This is not Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do."" When some east  coast thugs try to strongarm Mr. Stillwell into surrendering his dojo,  Sensei Stillwell tries to fend them off and uses his karate for defense  only, but has his leg broken by Ivan ""The Russian.""  This leads  him to move the family to Kingswood, Washington and to a new life for them  all. Jason just wants to start anew and when he befriends Rayford Jefferson  Madison III(RJ for short), he has found a friend for life. Jason shows RJ a  thing or two about karate; and Jason learns a thing or 2 about  breakdancing. RJ shows him some dance moves, and what makes this movie so  special is that RJ(who is black) turns into a white guy while doing some  dance moves. All seems well in Kingswood, until Scott(""Stick with me  kids and you'll never go hungry"")starts trouble. RJ is mysteriously  wandering in the parking lot of a local burger joint, when trouble starts.  Scott says ""There's that slimeball, RJ."" When one of Scott's  disciples asks ""Hey Scott, why do you hate that kid RJ so much?"";  Scott defiantly retorts, ""I've got my reasons.""  Scott and his  thugs then corner RJ, but Jason who also happens to be wandering in the  same parking lot, comes to help RJ. RJ then declares ""No Retreat No  Surrender!"" By uttering those words an inseparable bond is formed. I  never knew there were palm trees in Washington, but this is one of the many  suprises of this movie. RJ then takes Jason to join Ian  ""Whirlwind"" Reilly's dojo. You see, Ian just took 1st in the  nationals. Jason and RJ go to Ian's dojo and after Jason fills out the  application in record time, he decides to join. Unfortunately for Jason,  Scott just happens to be at the same dojo and tells Sensei Dean Ramsey that  Jason started the trouble at the burger joint. Shooting Star Ramsey then  commands his best fighter Frank Peters to fight Jason to prove the  supremacy of Seattle karate. Jason is thoroughly pummelled and then his  life starts in a downward spiral. At his girlfriend Kelly's birthday  party,he fights with Dean, and upon returning home to his house, his father  and him nearly come to blows. What's curious is that Jason never knew that  his girlfriend Kelly is actually Sensei Ian's brother. One would think it  might have come up in a previous conversation. Jason then seeks refuge in an  abandoned house that RJ provided. Bruce Lee's Spirit(Leedaga) then appears  and the real training begins. Will Jason get revenge on Ivan? Will Leedaga  show Jason that karate is not to be used aggressively? You must buy this  video to find out. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of the video.  The editing is fantastic, as well as the acting. It seems so real when they  show team Seattle training for the big fight, and it appears as if the film  is sped up, but it is the director's unique style. If you are a true  American you WILL buy this movie.",956966400,11,3180,4.550442477876106
501128,4,6302722764,"I would love to be able to give this movie the five stars it deserves for sheer excitement.  But despite being a massive fan, not even I can forgive RJ's 'Bruce Lee dance'(it really is sad!)and the somewhat less than  astounding acting.  With that said, the rest of the film is great.
The  movie follows a simialr path to most of the martial arts films that  engulfed our video shops in the eighties.  I.e. boy gets beaten up, boy  gets trained by master etc. etc....However this film does offer some  differences, firstly the master just happens to be Bruce Lee arisen from  the dead and the 'baddie' happens to be Jean Claude Van Damme in his first  film role.  Although revenge (that all to common driving force behind so  many movies in the genre) is the original motivating factor behind Jason's  (the boy) training, the movie surprisingly moves away from this to give a  refreshingly Gung ho! Adrenaline filled finale which will have you cheering  from your seat in true Rocky style.
Fans of Hong Kong cinemas will  probably criticise the fighting on display, but as a Karate practitioner  myself, I was very impressed with technical side of the fighting, the  powerful, well choreographed fight scenes once again bring me to compare  against the Rocky films in their ability to really get the audience  involved, to the point where you can almost smell the blood and sweat and  feel each body blow. This is one of those films which really motivates you,  whenever I don't feel like training I just put this into the vcr and two  hours later i'll be hitting the bags harder than anyone else in the class.  So what are you wasting time reading my review for? just go and get this  film now.",956620800,3,1695,4.60738255033557
501129,2,6302722764,"I rented this movie a long time ago, I was still a teenager, and the 80s was the decade of these silly low budget sophomoric movies, this is no exception. The storyline is so innocent, but I can identify being somewhat  of an outcast in my day and being picked on ,I can't help but notice the  similarity compared to ""The Karate Kid"" released 2 years earlier,  a boy learns the Martial Arts to battle karate school bullies. Does this  look familiar? Anyway, I was always in the corner of the underdog, at the  time I thought this movie was cool, but we all grow. It's funny the only  actor (If you can even call him that) to go on to bigger fame is Jean  Claude Van Damme, and he was only in this movie in the beginning and the  end. I guess someone saw something in him, he has a good physique and moves  well, thats all that mattered. I would recommend this film to those between  the ages of 15 and 18, but not to adults, who must shake their heads every  time their kid pops this in the VCR, saying in a low pitched voice ""Oh  Jeez!""

As for Van Damme,  it was a bit part, and to truly appreciate his greatness, move on to  ""Bloodsport"".  The movie does also have a certain amount of charm  and whimsy.",952473600,2,422,4.473684210526316
501131,1,6302722764,"This movie is atrocious. The acting is on a very low grade school level. The Title show Jean Claude Van Damme is to make you think that you might see some real good action. You only see him a drop at first, a little more  at the end, with some of the worst fight Choreography ever. The fight  scenes are reminisce of what little kids do in the playground. The plot  with great potential lead to empty characters, illogical acts, and a weak  ending.

This important movie from visionary Ng Se Yung will surely become one of our era's lasting contributions to western  thought. From the dazzling footwork of Peter 'sugarfoot' Cunningham  (""Hey, I'm nobody's lunch), to the stinging sarcastic wit of Dean  ""Shooting Star"" Ramsey (""L.A. karate...I'm impressed""  {see, he really wasn't impressed}); from the emotional father/son struggle  (""we'll start calling it your house when you start paying the  rent""),to the lasting bond of friendship of Jason/R.J.III (""Don't  worry, R.J. will provide""); NRNS has it all. It would be a shame if  100 gaping editing blunders were to overshadow what this film is all about:  Protecting seattle karate from the very real threat of an NYC/Russia  takeover. So what if the punching bag Jason ""kicks open"" is  already cut in half; and so what if Mr. Stillwell breaks his knee and wears  a cast that only covers his shin; and who cares if you can see the karate  class in the window's reflection after class has already been dismissed;  and pardon me for not lamenting over the fact that Scott's father gets  thrown out of a bar into the dark of night when it was broad daylight 2  minutes before. These are minor points that should not distract us from  Yung's message. Thank you Mr. Yung. Thank you Mr. Mckinney.
