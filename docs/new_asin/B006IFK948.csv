4990534,5,B006IFK948,"While Volume 1 of Kukla, Fran and Ollie: The First Episodes was a collection of what Burr Tillstrom himself counted as his favorite episodes, Volume 2 is advertised as episodes chosen by Burr's colleagues to demonstrate the development of the show over the years. To that effect, the selections for Volume 2 go from one of the earliest surviving episodes (a little over a month after the coaxial cable linking the east and the midwest went online, setting into motion the show's transition from regional to national sensation) to one of the only known surviving episodes from the ABC years, and a selection of the early 1960s 5-minute shows to sweeten the pot.

The only ABC episode is a humdinger, though: ""Bunny To Bunny"", the 1955 KFO Easter special, is Fletcher Rabbit's Edward R. Murrow-esque tour of the Easter Bunny's factory, and a fully staged production with orchestrated musical numbers,  involved-looking sets and props, and (this is a ""new"" development) multiple puppeteers. Although I love the loose, cozy nature of the improvised one-man-and-a-puppet-stage version of KFO, it's nice to see what happens when Burr and company get ambitious on the production side of things.

They're all marvelous, of course. These shows really do have a cumulative effect, so having more of them to see makes the golden era of Kukla, Fran and Ollie that much easier to love. That's my way of saying you need BOTH ""First Episodes"" volumes.",1325203200,13,1436,5.0

8498671,5,B006IFK948,"This is actually the second copy I have purchased--the first one I passed on to family with young children who were entranced by the mastery of Burr Tillstrom's art.  The gentle humor of Kukla, Fran and Ollie should be compulsory viewing for anyone weary of the current scope of what we refer to as ""popular entertainment.""  Buy it and see for yourself!",1391126400,3,353,4.67741935483871
