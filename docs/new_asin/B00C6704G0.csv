5690976,5,B00C6704G0,"The movie has a great story line.  It has many layers of relationship, between a father and a daughter, between a client and his manicurist, and between a husband and a wife.  In helping her client to better his marital problem, the manicurist became too close to her client.  She crosses that boundary of client/provider privilege.

She herself needs help in her personal relationship and seeks intimacy.  The problem stems from early childhood.  Flashback of childhood upbringing shows that she has been seeking her father's love all her life.  Familial duties force her to take care of her disabled father; she neglects her own needs in the process.  In the end, she did find a man who genuinely loves her, but the viewer is left wondering if she settles or does she really loves him.

Touch is a wonderful movie.  It will stir your emotions.  It entertains with wonderful cinematography from the director and through cultural expressions.  There are funny vignettes of the ladies who work in the nail salon and what they discuss in their natural language while working.",1370822400,3,1073,4.9
5690977,3,B00C6704G0,"I thought the main actress was endearing, with lots of potential. That's what kept me watching this movie. The story is so-so, the love scenes are not exactly sizzling, there are no surprises to expect. If you are an insomniac, this is a great movie as it will slowly put you in a dozing mode, with nice dreams to follow.",1370390400,2,321,4.366666666666666
5690978,4,B00C6704G0,"Very funny and perfect for that romance night. The movie really hit the heart and your emotion. It's truly an amazing movie to watch. Great script for the characters, they show the kindness, hardship, and the battle we goes each day. How we tend to hurt the one we love most, not intentionally but it's just when we are so busy and we forgot how to love or show the passion for our love one.",1370390400,5,391,4.226666666666667
5690979,5,B00C6704G0,"Most sensual Indie film of the summer. Directed by Vietnamese-American director Minh Duc Nguyen and starring Porter Lynn.

5690980,5,B00C6704G0,"I had the pleasure of watching this film at a film festival recently.  What a joy!  TOUCH has the perfect combination of warmth, joy, drama, humor and angst.  The film is directed amazingly well...and the cast is excellent.  What a great story!

5690981,5,B00C6704G0,Every now and then I run across a film that moves me to the point where I get a lump in my throat and my eyes tear up...but I also laugh out loud at parts.  That film is TOUCH.  It is a perfect blend of drama with humor kicked in at appropriate times.  This film is a real joy to watch!  I highly recommend watching TOUCH.  It is expertly directed and the cast is terrific.  You won't be disappointed.,1369872000,13,401,4.012658227848101
5690982,5,B00C6704G0,"This is an extremely engaging film, and an utter joy to watch.  It's clever, gentle, quietly witty, brushed with melancholy, and lovingly shot.

5690983,5,B00C6704G0,"Brendan (portrayed by John Ruby) is a mechanic desperate to save his failing marriage. He visits a nail salon, where he meets Tam (portrayed by Porter Lynn), a shy new employee who offers guidance upon Brendan's request. Along the way, their unexpected friendship provides some welcome revelations, and takes both of them as well as those around them in directions unforeseen. This is crux of 'Touch'.

Directed by Minh Duc Nguyen, 'Touch' offers some of the best metaphor usage I have ever seen in a a movie. The multi-edged meaning of the film's title displays itself over and over. While the acting was above average by the mostly Vietnamese cast, Porter Lynn as Tam is a breakout star waiting to happen. As the reserved manicurist, she often communicates without saying much at all. This truly was a tour de force for her, and I look forward to see what the future holds for her. The screenwriters weave an intricate allegory that will keep you thinking about the movie long after you've stopped watching it.

'Touch' is a unique, emotionally complex narrative that will keep its audience engaged from beginning to end. This is a great movie that deserves an audience, and I encourage you to become a part of it.",1366761600,3,1216,4.785714285714286

5690985,4,B00C6704G0,"I liked the movie. it kept me there, wanting to see what happened next. Even though the pace is very, very slow, I think that it makes the film, it builds and builds your expectations. Sadly for me, the ending was not to my liking. I get that the author might have wanted to have an unexpected ending, but I just feel like everyone just settled. Where's the risk taking when you want something so badly? I don't know. I have mixed emotions about this film. I did cry like a baby with the scene with her father towards the end. The main actor is absolutely stunning! The actress touched my heart, so many emotions kept inside due to cultural expectations. I praise her, the character for dealing with everything life dealt her with such grace! And so what if she dealt in ways that others would deem unsuitable. It's her life. I liked it, but would have liked her to have her deliriously happy ending, not just her being content..",1519862400,,929,4.43859649122807
5690986,5,B00C6704G0,"Beautiful. It gets at something that is a plague in our society today--Our inability to be able to tolerate touching one another. I wonder if the reason we long for sexual connection so quickly and want such a huge amount of it at times is really just us wanting to be touched affectionately? To be able to have skin to skin contact with another is something we carry around from our primal beginnings as children. It is hard to be labeled as ""too much"" by others. I have begun to see that I am not ""too much."" Actually, I am a healthy adult with healthy needs and wants. I see now that those who would label me this way may have problem with being ""too little"" in expressing or validating their needs and wants. They have suppressed theirs. Therefore, they look to suppress it in others. But, I digress.

The movie makes you think. It is full of warmth. It would make for an interesting ""date night movie."" Reason being is the conflicts and issues this production raises could help you move yourself and your relationship in good directions. It would definitely help increase intimacy and facilitate discussions about intimacy.

Give it a shot.",1518652800,,1145,4.607843137254902

When it's finished, you might cry tears of separation, as I did, because I was sorry to see it end. And yet, it's the perfect ending.",1513728000,,292,3.9661016949152543

5691003,1,B00C6704G0,"Welcome to the demasculinization of America. The movie opens with a black woman describing how her husband is mesmerized by her feet! Maybe they could not find a black man to accept that role. That was just a warm up for what to come. The young millennial white and Asian males in this movie are wusses who are whipped by the all-empowered females. The older generation cruel Asian male is demonized as a heartless tyrant who gets his share of punishment and finally succumbs to his 'victim' after he literally breaks every bone in his body, crawls, cries, and lays at her feet. I was expecting the conclusion to be that the 'men' will end up dating each other. After all, they sure acted like they are not capable of holding their ground with the other sex. Wait, maybe that's what the sequel will.",1501977600,4,799,4.555555555555555

5691006,3,B00C6704G0,"Poor acting for the husband's character keeps this movie from being better. Plus little things like why does he start showing up at her house all of a sudden, and why is she allowed to only come to work when she feels like it? But the story kept me interested and I couldn't tell for sure how it would all work out. There are hints of something in Tam's past that is never made clear, and that adds a dimension to her character. The ending was reasonable.",1501372800,,455,4.241379310344827
5691007,5,B00C6704G0,I LOVED this movie. Good movies are far and few between these days. Very beautiful and emotional movie - evocative. Genuinely touched my heart. And I am so glad that the leading woman ended up with the engineer good guy.,1501200000,2,220,4.525

5691009,5,B00C6704G0,"Not to be confused with other same or similar-titled offerings, this insightful and engaging one is written, directed and edited by Minh Duc Nguyen. You might not be charmed at first, because the opening scene delivers some serious trash-talking by the bevy of manicurists at VIP Nails. But that seems to serve more as counterpoint to this wonderfully sensitive tactile journey.  Tam (Porter Lynn) a Vietnamese-American manicurist, knows all about the magic of touch, severely punished as a child by her father for clinging to her mother for that soothing comfort.  When the very attractive, naturally self-conscious mechanic, Brendan (John Ruby), presents at her workplace for oil-stained-hand-cleansing, the exquisite drama begins. His wife rejects him, mainly his touch, and he decides cleaning his hands is the way to begin reclaiming the relationship. Tam embarks on an arresting tutorial with some engaging in vivo lab work. But does it cross the line? You decide.  The cinematography is excellent, with choice subjects and especially skilled close work. The music is just right; the acting solid across the board. This is a deeply moving beautiful exploration of what is inherent, unless spoiled by insensitivity or cruelty--  skin hunger-- the longing for touch, the lovely feel of skin on skin. I saw this film a few years ago and am delighted to see that Prime has captured it.  Highly recommend!",1500249600,9,1406,5.20353982300885

Involves multiple core relationships (e.g. parent-child), not just the obvious romantic one at the center. Some of the disappointed commenters here did not get it. They are wishing for the happy, obvious ending, favoring the white American man, a nice frilly romance where butterfly-like sensations win, and the movie did not offer that. But as it is, the ending is profound. It offers a less popular view on what love is: commitment to make someone happy, to be there for them no matter what they need, a decision to always stand with them and for them, to be truly involved with them, with their demons, as well as with their better angels.",1419552000,6,785,4.737226277372263

5691032,5,B00C6704G0,"This entry from the USA got split reactions from our Seattle International Film Festival audience. Some thought it slight and the rest of us liked it. To me, the film is contrived, but sensual and sweet. It isn't really predictable but we are invested enough to care what happens. John Ruby (lots of TV) is a mechanic whose wife objects to his oil-stained hands. He visits a young manicurist in hopes that she can make him more acceptable to his wife.

The manicurist, played by Porter Lynn in her screen debut, not only cleans up his hands, she offers him advise, much to the amusement of her lively coworkers, all of whom provide a generous supply of comic relief throughout the film.

A montage behind the opening credits amplified on the film's name: Each image offered something that relates to ""Touch.""
  * A manicurist
  * A dog groomer
  * A mechanic
  * A seamstress
  * A pizza maker
  * A masseuse
  * A hair stylist
  * A baker
  * A baby's parent
  * A myriad other images flash past and we identify and smile at each.

I confess my main reason for liking this one was the young man cast in the lead. If television is the only place I can see John Ruby, I may have to start watching it! He makes my socks roll up and down! Yum!!!

5691038,2,B00C6704G0,"I enjoy foreign films and unique storylines but this was slow and vague.  I get the premise - touch is essential to our well-being but I think this woman's need for touch was excessive.  Felt more like a fetish of some sort rather than sensual as some reviews indicate.  Sure, there was some disfunction in her childhood courtesy of her father's apparent aversion to it but it still seemed over the top. If I had a kid who had to cling to my bare leg I'd be worried too.  It was just way too slow-moving with an ending that indicated some closure but what exactly I don't know.  Maybe I was too tired to fully appreciate it but I don't think it would've been anymore scintillating in the light of day. The interactions with her coworkers were by far the most interesting.

5691045,5,B00C6704G0,"For a budget indie film, the cinematography was wonderful.  I think the acting of Tam's character reflects the true nature of Asians heavily influenced by their culture, in that I mean their subdued expressions and characteristics.  I think the Director wanted to stay with that.  The Mechanic's initial intention was solely get his hands and nails clean to satisfy his wife.  Nothing else.  But it seemed to me he was captivated by her sheer Asian delicate beauty.  Both him and Tam were craving 'touch.'  Both physical and emotional.  He wasn't getting it from his wife (who he missed and desperately wanted back along with his 'needs' met), and Tam no longer was from her deceased nurturing mother.  Put that together with two good looking lonely people and that is a perfect recipe for an affair.  They both knew it was wrong (remember the camera focusing in closely at the mechanic's wedding ring and Tam looking up at him with a look as to say ""This is wrong"" as she was cleaning his hand), yet Tam stayed quiet without actually voicing her concern because she too was wanting 'touch' just as much as her client, the mechanic was.  Finally, as he and his wife were working out their marital problems and 're-connecting', he was slowly detaching himself from Tam, yet still missed what he and she shared.  The advice Tam gave him on improving his marriage seemed to be working and that, along with his wife doing her part on improving the marriage, enabled them to 'become One' again.  He no longer cared if he was being ""a wimp"" by wearing gloves again to help keep his hands cleaner.  Therefore visits with Tam at the Salon were no longer needed.  When Tam drove to see him at his work (she was still attached to him) and saw the gloves on his hands, it spoke 'volumes' and she then knew he was fully committed again with his wife and that the affair was over.  She drove off and that was the end of that.  The ending scene was perfect IMO.  Both Tam and her father were getting satisfaction; he sitting at the park pond, and she getting her craving 'touch' from her date from the restaurant.  It seemed to me as she was non-verbally giving a message to her father, as if to say, ""it's payback time for how you treated me when I was a child.  I am now finally getting my much deserved 'touch.'""  I also want to point out that this movie can provide lessons on strengthening relationships/marriages because there is truth in it and it could cut back the divorce rate.  This movie is by far one of the best I've seen.",1386633600,3,2522,4.508810572687224

This is definitely a ""chick flick"" kinda of movie (as other reviewers have said), but don't fret there's not too much estrogen to disinterest the opposite sex.""Touch"" had some interesting characters (primarily from Tam's co-workers who add the funny elements to the movie), pretty good acting (Don't expect too much from the crying scenes, its definitely not up to par with Anne Hathaway's performance in Les Miserables...STTTRRRRIIIIIIIIDDDDDDEEE. Sorry, I couldn't help myself.)and decent cinematography as well. On the downside, I would have liked the movie to delve deeper into Tam's childhood and the relationship with her father a tad more because Tam is a pretty intriguing character and is the centerpiece to the movie in my opinion. I also was a little disappointed by the ending, as to whether the two (Tam and her father) mended or were working on their relationship. But, all in all, this was a pleasure to watch.

He confides in her and she offers suggestions.  I started to get confused because I thought a line was going to be crossed, which one was, kind of, but not really.  Anyway the story shows how their interaction affects their personal lives.  The acting is OK.  I felt that the actress who plays Tam is a little too expressionless for me. Since she basically has the same expression for happiness, sadness, and anger, I couldn't really tell what she is supposed to be conveying in a scene.  I had to insert how I'd feel in that situation.  That was kind of frustrating.  But the overall story itself is still decent.  I'd watch it again.",1373760000,,889,4.598726114649682

When we see Tam as emotionally bankrupt with a condescending, crippled  father  who has no feeling  towards her, we can understand her attraction to this vulnerable,handsome man who is searching for some connection that he does not have with his wife.

8577536,5,B00C6704G0,"This is a wonderfully sensitive film about the search for love and the compromises necessary in missing what may have been the ideal. In my view the film ultimately asks the question is it love that makes a successful relationship, or is it something else.

The camera loves Porter Lynn who is able to bring us into her interior life, and we want to see ever emotion that runs through her. John Ruby and Melinda Bennett turn in good performances as well. An ensemble cast of manicurists provide delightful humorous relief.

I did not feel that the film drug at any point. Of course this is not an action film. The interior life is the point, and we see the actors struggle through their conflicted desires, hopes and dreams.

The plot is not complex. And we are left wanting more. The story supports greater investigation certainly into Porter's ultimate decision, and into  the relationship between Ruby's and Bennett's characters.
