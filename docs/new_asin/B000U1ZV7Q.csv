2914982,5,B000U1ZV7Q,"Great collection overall, although I would have expected the werewolf movies to be together on one disc and the body snatcher movies on the other. Anyway they look pretty good, anamorphic ws on all as i recall.

Bad MOON requires you to get past some major schlock in the first 5 minutes, and after that there isn't a whole lot going on. I give it staggered 1 view

Coma was a good sci fi vehicle for Douglas and Bjould I give it 2 views

Wolfen is pretty interesting, with its offbeat cast, it take a more cerebral approach. Carefully developing the characters and ground rules up until the great finale. I give it at the least 3 to 4 views.

Body Snatchers lives up to its namesakes legacy, while the budget didn't seem to be too high it succeeds in creepy. Abel Ferrara most likely made this as a favor for someone as it lacks his signature themes. I give it 3 to 4 views

Note that I rate the films by how many times I can stand to watch them, for example a great film by Leone, or Kurosawa or the original invasion of the body snatchers gets a multi view rating meaning they can be watched over 6 times and as many times as necessary.",1289606400,8,1139,4.2304147465437785
2914983,4,B000U1ZV7Q,"WARNER's ""HORROR: 4 FILM FAVORITES"" consists of two dual-side recorded discs of American fright films made between 1978 and '96. Transfer quality of these is excellent.

SYNOPSES--

BAD MOON--  The family dog defeats Uncle Werewolf. Cheesy special effects and a small budget hardly detract from a mediocre script.

BODY SNATCHERS--  Family staying at a Southern military base notice that soldiers are acting oddly. The EPA inspector's daughter is warned to stay awake, because ""they"" get you when you sleep.

COMA--  A hospital's patients are being killed so their organs can be sold on the black market. This set's oldest film is also the best of the bunch. Superb cast includes small roles for Tom Selleck and Ed Harris (who made his screen debut here). Directed and scripted by author Michael Crichton-- he based his screenplay on Robin Cook's bestseller.

WOLFEN--  A NYC cop investigating deaths that appear to be animal attacks discovers an Indian legend concerning wolf spirits. (Watch for a cameo by Tom Waits as the ""drunken bar owner."")

2915112,4,B000U1ZV7Q,"Even if you like only really like Coma and Wolfen as I do this is still quite a bargain. Both have great stories and very good picture quality. Both are very suspenseful in their own unique way. Genevieve Bujold gives a tour de force performance as the menaced doctor in the 1978 ""Coma"". And the great Albert Finney also gives a wonderful performance as a detective in the very original "" Wolfen"" from 1981. As a matter of fact I consider "" Wolfen"" to be a great werewolf movie that's not really about werewolfs at all. As I said very original. And quite scary.
"" Bad Moon"" is a second rate B movie that is just OK. It has silly cheap special affects. And "" Body Snatchers"" is a third go round for "" Invasion of the Body Snatchers""and by far the worst of the three.
 So this set is definitely a steal just to get ""Coma"" and Wolfen"" at a great price with good picture quality. And who knows, you might also like the other two better than I did. This a genuine bargain in any case.",1429315200,,979,4.207446808510638
2915113,4,B000U1ZV7Q,"All four of these films are entertaining to a horror fan like me. I didn't like 'Wolfen' that much when it first came out and I saw it at the movie theater. The murkiness of the plot is mainly in the explanation of the creatures themselves. At one point, a native American character in the film explains to the detective (Albert Finney) investigating some gruesome killings, apparently by wolves, that ""they might be gods"". Okay. So are they, or not? Thefilm implies that the creatures have existed long before man and... well you figure it out. Wolf spirits, werewolves or whatever they are. The film is well done though, and holds your interest. I like it better now that I've seen it a few times. Sometimes crystal clarity in horror is detrimental to the flow and mystery of a story. Keep them guessing, I say.
'Bad Moon' is a straight up werewolf movie with Michael Pare as the lupine uncle of a woman and her young son. He's bitten early on in the movie by a large snarling werewolf. Some say the werewolf effects are cheesy, but I thought they were excellent for a movie with a small budget. If you want to see cheesy, watch any of the 'Howling' sequels, the 'Howling' being my favorite werewolf movie right beside 'An American Werewolf in London'. But I digress.
'Body Snatchers' is pretty good, but doesn't cover much more ground than the original black and white version 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' with Kevin McCarthy (best version to me) who also has a brief cameo in the runner-up pod people movie with Donald Sutherland. Still, it's a good action and horror movie and well worth watching.
And the winner is! 'Coma', as far as white knuckle thrills. This is an unusual pick for my top film of the collection, because I've been a lover of monsters since I was a kid...and there are no aliens or monsters in this one, except for human monsters who believe they have the right to dictate who lives and who dies. It's well paced and well directed (Michael Crichton who also wrote the screenplay from Robin Cook's book), and makes you truly concerned for poor Genevieve Bujold's character who spends much of the movie running from unscrupulous people who want to kill her. A well paced thriller with good acting, a great plot, and an exciting and satisfying climax.
And not a bad price for all this excitement.",1428969600,,2322,4.624697336561743
2915173,5,B000U1ZV7Q,"Four movies for less than the price of one.  My experience has been the four-movie sets sold by Warner Home Video are of excellent quality.  I bought this collection to receive Coma and Wolfen, two outstanding thrillers.  Body Snatchers, the third version of this alien story, was a pleasant surprise while Bad Moon was a bit of a dog.  All films are 16 x 9 anamorphic widescreen and are presented on two double-sided discs.",1427673600,,424,4.6891891891891895
2915174,5,B000U1ZV7Q,"I really wanted Bad Moon, so I received four movies for the price of one. When I see a movie or two attached together in a deal like this, I always buy the DVD set for one price. Although Bad Moon was released in 1996, it still is a very high priced movie DVD on Amazon at the Prime's price. This is most definitely a good price to get Bad Moon.",1427155200,,345,3.8732394366197185

2915224,5,B000U1ZV7Q,"Phenomenal films conveniently put together. Only bought it for Bad Moon, ended up loving Wolfen as well. Worth adding to your collection if nothing else because of the value.",1415232000,,174,5.0344827586206895
2915225,4,B000U1ZV7Q,not bad,1412985600,,7,3.0
2915226,4,B000U1ZV7Q,"This is a pretty solid horror movie collection you've got here. Wolfen is a really interesting spin on the werewolf movie genre and has some great performances in it. The entire movie is sort of a mystery about who or what is killing people in a rundown NY neighborhood. You will THINK you have it all figured out, but then the ending comes and completely makes your head spin. Body Snatchers is another take on the Invasion of the Body Snatchers story. This takes place on a military base with a new family moving in and finding that not everything or everybody is what they seem. This is an interesting take on the old familiar alien invasion sci-fi trope and there are at least two moments in this film where I was completely blindsided by who turned out to be a pod person. Bad Moon is pretty much what you'd expect from a movie called Bad Moon. It does, in fact, have a very well made werewolf and a few scary moments. You know pretty much from the get go who the monster is. What's cool is watching him in human form as he tries to come to terms with what has happened to him and how it's going to effect those around him. Pretty good flick. I'll be honest, I haven't watched all of Coma. I started it and got a little bored. It is more of a medical drama/thriller than a horror movie. It has a good cast and is based on a Michael Crichton novel, so it's probably pretty good. It's just an odd addition to this collection of pure horror movies. Of the three movies that I did watch from this collection, I am pleasantly surprised. Well worth the price of admission. There are a lot of these multiple movie collections out there that are just pure garbage. One good movie and a bunch of terrible movies that Sharknado would look down on. This is not one of them. Horror fans should give it a try.",1412812800,4,1801,4.3
2915227,5,B000U1ZV7Q,"I was searching the web for a dvd copy of Bad Moon to replace my VHS one. Since it's considered ""rare and OOP"" (out-of-print), people expect you to pay $68 for it. Let me play psychic for a minute and reveal that you just said ""screw that!"" in your head, because that's a cleaner variation of what I said when I saw it on here for that price. Ebay was not much friendlier to my wallet either. So, I remembered seeing it on one of those 4 film favorites that WalMart is so famous for selling in the $5 bins and began searching for that. Voila! Here it was. When you can pick it up like this for around $7, get it shipped to your door AND get Wolfen plus 2 other flicks...well, shut up and take me money!  Never seen Coma and barely recall the Body Snatcher flick, but hey! bonus movies! I'm not gonna lose sleep over that.",1412467200,,821,4.13125
2915228,5,B000U1ZV7Q,This is a collection of movies with varying levels of quality. Wolfen is surprisingly good and is about wolves trying to take back their habitat from New Yorkers. Bad Moon is about a young woman who helps out a young man but finds out that there is more to him than meets the eye. Coma is surprisingly tame compared to other horror movies but is still very much a thriller. Human experimentation is never pretty. Body Snatchers is what you think; it is basically the same as The Invasion of the Body Snatchers where humans are being replaced by alien lookalikes. These movies in this collection are made a little better than other horror collections that I have found recently. Enjoy!,1407715200,,684,4.661157024793388
2915229,4,B000U1ZV7Q,"Coma can be found in the 4 Film Michael Douglas collection but the other three are quite nice, especially Bad Moon. When reviewing these DVD movies, most people fail to mention the most important aspect: Is it Anamorphic?.

I will tell you, all four movies are Anamorphic and look fantastic when played on a Widescreen TV with a HDMI DVD Upscaler. Also, to get a sharper picture you should turn OFF any Noise filtering your TV may be doing and make sure you are connected via the HDMI cable; a DVD can't be upscaled from any other connection (Composite Etc.) and make sure the Upscaler is using 720p or 1080p and not 480i/p. If you did it right, your DVDs will look very much like HD programming. Also make sure you are at least 6 Feet away from your TV, which has actually always been the recommended viewing distance.

Another tip, if you want your TV to last longer, turn the backlight/brightness down to 50% or less. Also try not to turn it off and on too much as the Power Supply is usually the 1st thing to go. Believe it or not, leaving your TV on all the time will give you more life than turning it on and off. I use to repair Televisions, incidentally we use to get a lot of Sony and RCA TVs in our shop; not that it means anything.

In any case this is a good buy. You should be aware though, these 4 Film Favorites usually use the ""old"" transfers and sometimes Warner Bro. copies the wrong side of the disk and you end up with a Fullscreen version even though the box states it as Widescreen; as is the case with the collection containing the movie ""Copycat"". It's just bad quality control and Warner Bros. isn't interested in correcting it.",1397347200,,1653,4.343042071197411
2915230,5,B000U1ZV7Q,"Been hunting for Bad Moon, a werewolf movie featuring a charismatic German Shepherd named 'Thor.' Trying to find this on Amazon. Easy.

Coma-brilliant, Wolfen, a flashback to m youth werewolf movie with Albert Finney, and a redo of Body Snatchers that is a terrific Sci-Fi. I scored big on this buy; this 4 movie DVD... cheaper than the one movie Bad Moon DVDs.

I saw Wolfen at a young age and it left a mark on me forever. There are a couple scenes that drag on but the film goes over pretty quick. Bad Moon stars the sassy and attractive Mariel Hemingway. The film is a unique, original, gory, fantastic, werewolf film. Coma I have yet to see. Body Snatchers is okay it's not bad but it is not that good, if your gonna watch a film about Body Snatchers see Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978 and Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956.
