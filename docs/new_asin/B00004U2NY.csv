7923433,4,B00004U2NY,"This movie involves a parasite but enters the body in such a simple way. And this parasite is passed from host to host in the most strangest and disgusting ways. I'd say this much like a ""sexual"" zombie like thriller. Where the hosts are often attached to themselves while passing the parasite to infect the others. It does give you the kind of give you that warm happy ending that most classic horror films often times end with.",1041552000,,429,4.512820512820513
7923434,4,B00004U2NY,"Also known as THEY CAME FROM WITHIN (a far more appropriate title), SHIVERS is the eye-popping debut of Canadian auteur David Cronenberg, probably best known for VIDEODROME, THE FLY and DEAD RINGERS.  Due to the very low budget of this film, the special effects are not quite up to Cronenberg's usual high standards - the effect of the well-done appliances which enable us to see the parasite moving underneath the skin of its victims are nearly compromised by the appearance of the parasite, which basically looks like a moving mound of bloody dung, and is even less convincing thanks to way too many close-ups of the thing in nice bright light!  However, SHIVERS is that rarity in the world of the macabre - like most of Cronenberg's work, SHIVERS is a horror film of ideas in addition to mere effects, and the ideas in SHIVERS are brilliant.  Produced at the mid-'70's height of the sexual revolution, SHIVERS is on one level a delicious satire on the mating customs and relationships of the upwardly mobile, liberal, middle classes.  The film opens with a calm, soothing salesman's voice showing off the facilities and interiors of the deluxe, ultra-modern Starliner apartment complex.  Even before we meet any of the characters, we have a pretty good idea about the kind of people they are, thanks to the very trendy decors in the apartments - shag rugs, sleek furniture, wood paneling, waterbeds  and macrame abound.  The lives of the Starliner's inhabitants are self-centered and self-absorbed; if you can afford to live on totally self-sufficient Starliner Island (where shops, apartments, medical facilities and entertainment are all readily available), you can ignore the outside world completely.  Starliner Island's exclusivity (its big selling point) eventually becomes its Achilles heel, allowing all of the residents to be infected by the parasites within the course of a single night.  Don't think that this movie is a hedonist's delight just because of the sexual nature of Cronenberg's parasite - not everyone who becomes infected is young and beautiful!  The boundaries between husband and wife, hetero- and homo-, age and youth are violated constantly, and even incest is ultimately no big deal.  The inhabitants of the Starliner become better-dressed, sexualized versions of the zombies in Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the final sequence in the Starliner's swimming pool, where the residents victimize the last inhabitant free of the parasite and then engage in one big love-in, is utterly horrifying, a kind of sexual anarchy.  The paralells between HIV and Cronenberg's parasite (which, however, may not be deadly - no one in this film dies as a result of the infestation) are quite striking.  SHIVERS suggests that the polymorphous sexuality celebrated in the ""liberated"" era of 1965-1981 may have been a lessening of individuality and a diminishment of human potential rather than an expansion of it.  In this regard, SHIVERS is a profoundly moralistic and conservative film, yet its exploration of the dark power of sex belies liberal assumptions about human happiness being contingent on ""sexual freedom"" and raises issues about the nature of sex which many people find difficult to confront.  Even in this early film, Cronenberg's ideas about the simultaneous joy and horror of the body are present and fully developed.  I was astounded by this film and highly recommend it - certainly, it could never be made today!  A courageous and shocking work.",985996800,5,3487,5.143362831858407
7923435,4,B00004U2NY,"Right now David Cronenberg is easily my favorite writer/director, what with impressive films like ""Dead Ringers,"" ""eXistenZ,"" ""The Dead Zone,"" and ""Naked Lunch"" tucked under his belt.  ""Shivers"" was his feature debut, a film about a parasite that infects the residents of a self-contained modern apartment complex, turning them into animal-like sex maniacs.
Made in 1975 with a low budget and a 15-day(!) shooting schedule, Cronenberg shows uncanny expertise behind the camera (even though, in an interview after the movie, he claims he had no idea what he was doing).  The buildup to the freaky climax isn't without its slow spots, but in general the movie keeps a quick pace and the last act will definitely remind seasoned horror fans of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" (just try to remember that THAT horror masterpiece only came along in 1979).
Anchor Bay home video has done a good job at remastering another obscure title (as usual), but the version of ""Shivers"" I got is NOT widescreen (the video box states it is) and for the first half of the movie (at least), there are blurry trails left behind the characters when they move; it's not terrible, just a little distracting.  On the other hand, after the movie there's a trailer and a 20-25 minute interview with Cronenberg himself that's pretty amusing.",975283200,,1316,4.9457013574660635
7923436,4,B00004U2NY,"SHIVERS has another title, THEY CAME FROM WITHIN. Stars Barbra Steele, Joe Silver, and Paul Hampton. A sadistic doctor calls for volunteers in his  medical research. When  a young woman accepts his offer, all the men she  meets are endangered. Great way to keep safe-sex message! We enjoyed wacky  warped aspect.",967161600,,312,5.0588235294117645
