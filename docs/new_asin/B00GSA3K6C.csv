This was not the case for Capital Game the movie, it  was surprisingly good especially for a low  budget film. The story of Mark and Steve captivate me from the first time I read the book and the 100 time after.  I love Mark's personality, here was a guy who always struggle with his sexuality but until he met Steve was he able to let go and experience what he had hidden deep inside. Steve was strong, even with his family baggage,  he always goes after what he wants and with one touch from Mark he knew Mark was the one for him.  I wish the Movie was longer and i wanted more and more of the story.  I also imagine Mark and Steve differently the actors were great but I really wanted more of Mark and Steve like they were in the book strong and control. Overall, the movie was great cant wait to watch it over and over again.  Ga. Hauser what a wonderful job, cant wait for more books to movie.",1385164800,2,1019,4.18974358974359
6106489,5,B00GSA3K6C,"I am a huge GA Houser fan, especially of Mark Richfield so when I saw the advertising for a movie.....about Mark Antonious Richfield, I was pumped. Then not so much when I saw the actors. Everyone knows Mark has shoulder length, straight hair and he doesn't like hair on his face so I was a little less excited but being a loyal fan of Housers books, I bought the DVD as soon as it was available. Houser blog warns you that this is a low budget film; however, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't feel like I was watching low budget. Don't.get me wrong, no one is winning an Oscar but it was above low budget. Even though Mark doesn't look like Mark, this actor does grow on you and pull you in and he is a cutie.  Jack, although looks sexy, seems stilted and awkward when speaking. Steve... well, I just couldn't connect with him as Steve but be did play the part well. I am giving this 5 stars just because it was so much better than I expected. Maybe with enough sales, more movies can be made on our favorite boys... Mark, Steve, Adam, Jack...",1385164800,,1047,4.287878787878788
6106490,5,B00GSA3K6C,"Ga Hauser was one of the first M/M books I ever picked up. I started with Acting Naughty, and made my way to Capital Games. I loved the relationship between Mark and Steve throughout all the books. So, when I heard she was making a movie about it? Well, I about screamed. Bought it, watched it, loved it. The movie takes you from Steve's past to meeting Mark for the first time. The hate/hate/love/love, to the I-can't-keep-my-hands-off-you, was brilliant, and I am not surprised. The actors were wonderful, the movie was tastefully done. Once again, GA pulls off another masterpiece. ;)",1385164800,3,587,4.821782178217822

Of course wishing it could be a little racier, but understanding having to stay within the rating, I loved the actors that were cast for all of the parts loved the storyline and loved the movie in general!! I am glad it came together the way it did and I was glad to see your first film be such a success!! Well done, GA. Going back to reread the book now that I have seen the movie. This is one I don't mind owning because I will watch it over and over whenever I am in the mood for a good old fashioned love story. Bravo!",1385164800,,617,3.944
6106492,5,B00GSA3K6C,"First, I have to say I loved the book this film was adapted from.  In many cases, what makes it to the screen is hugely different from the written page. That is not the case with Capital Games. The film stays true to the story, which I'm sure is largely due to the fact that Ms. Hauser is the driving force behind the film.

This is a wonderful story of two men who fall in love, both with issues in their past which make being in love not the easiest thing to accept.  The cinematography is beautiful and the actors are superb in bringing Ms. Hauser's characters to life.

If you have read the book and enjoyed it, you will love this film. If you're just in the mood for a great film and watching two men fall in love and figure out their lives, you need to watch this film.

6106493,5,B00GSA3K6C,"I am a HUGE fan of G.A. Hauser's books and was thrilled to be able to get an advanced copy of her film, ""Capital Games"" at the GRL 2013. The film was beyond my expectations. Steve Miller (Eric Presnall) has recently split up with his girlfriend Sonja as well as quit the LAPD. Deciding to get into the advertising world he encounter suave Mark Richfield (Gregor Cosgrove) and electricity as well as sparks fly. The firm has a retreat in the Santa Fe Desert and Steve becomes very competitive with Mark. At the retreat they get to know each other very well and Steve also finds out that Mark has a fianc, Sharon. Steve not convinced that Mark is totally straight goes to his home and runs into Mark's very sexy roommate, Lawyer, Jack Larsen (Shane Keough. I do not want to give away anything more. The cinematography is beautiful as are the songs in the film which the multi-talented G.A. Hauser also wrote.

This is one of those films that you watch and say, ""Wow, that was even better than the fantastic book!"" The screenplay was so well adapted, so close to the original and the characters of Mark, Steven, and Jack were very realistically portrayed. I have read the book several times but seeing it on the wide screen is much different. From the opening credits, with a magnificent aerial view of our beautiful California coastline to the closing scenes with our boys faces awash in pleasure and deeply in love, I was captivated by the action. I congratulate the wonderful author, GA Hauser, the cast, and the crew, and the fantastic editing that brought it all to life. I am thrilled to see how others react to this great great film!

He is the main reason why I enjoyed this film. Some of the other acting was to be kind, lacking! Eric is multi-talented as well as beautiful! Author G A Hauser played her script very cautiously. Sometimes a little too much. The movie did have a happy ending which is a little unusual for a gay film. There was much tenderness especially from Steve. Eric conveyed that tenderness very well.

6106529,5,B00GSA3K6C,"SPOILER ALERTS:

I loved this movie.  I recently re-watched it and was amazed at how well it was done, especially given its limited budget.  Some of  the supporting casts performances were good and some not so good.  But the pacing, set design and cohesiveness of the plot were exceptional.  The cinematography was stellar, using great aerial and freeway footage of L.A.  And the music, much of which I believe was written for the show, was incredible; it really intensified and deepened key scenes like the beach, the car drives (all of them) and the scenes in Steve's bedroom.

The two leads were superb and their portrayals are not only passionate but, importantly, ring true to people who have been in this situation.  Both Eric and Gregor are incredibly handsome men, in very different ways, and their chemistry and attraction for each other poured off the screen.  They both deserve future consideration for meaty, demanding roles.

I have to say that the movie was intensely and beautifully erotic, but never slipped into any semblance of pornography or even soft-porn kitsch.  The scene with Steve in his officers uniform frisking Mark against the wall could be studied by novice filmmakers on how to depict explosive sexual tension without the need to bare a lot of skin.  And the few subtle scenes of the naked male form lovingly caught both the power and vulnerability of a mans body and soul.

Best, the ending was joyful, as it had to be for these two characters. I note from people who read the novel that this was a pretty faithful interpretation of a great and romantic book.

Give this movie a chance. Its tastefulness, attention to detail (especially in some great music during key scenes) and, most importantly, some great acting by the two leads paint a worthy image of two men deeply in love.",1511827200,4,1813,4.803225806451613

This one dragged on forever to it's inevitable conclusion with few surprises, other than the tediousness of when they would finally just either end it or get together. side plots were purposeless. The guys were very good looking, but that didn't even seem to interest the filmmaker, as there was only one actual erotic scene, which was poorly edited.",1511568000,,491,4.764705882352941

I run my audio through a fairly good sound system yet at several critical points early on I had to play scenes several times to hear what was being said. Finally I just gave up and turned on the subtitles.

There was some serious over-acting during parts of the film, most notably when the emotions went from calm to infuriated - without a real believable catalyst. Steve's sister, although not prominent, played her part well; I'd certainly cast her. Overall I enjoyed the film even with its little flaws. I particularly give the Director credit for not being afraid to show some small amount of very nice D. After all, that is a pretty important element in a relationship between men...

Looks like everyone was reading their lines off of cue cards, a soundtrack that drowns out every salvageable moment, and really so many flip flops in how the two lead actors felt about each other, it was hard to keep track.
Then there's the thing about the one actor that was supposed to be British, but he kept changing his accent, and has this gratuitous crotch shot that either proves he was Jewish or Muslim, or they just got it wrong all together. But they both do have pretty blue eyes. (Not nearly enough to salvage this turkey).
This one is the Gay TeleNovella of the year ,where no one is actually expected to believe any of it. Its all done in fun as a parody, only the actors don't seem to know it.

The rivals-to-lovers thread was treated a bit hastily, but the real script weakness was leaning on that tired old gay-for-you thing, at least on the part of Steve. Mark's Kinsey spectrum status was also more or less kept in the wings; self-declared as a hetero but best friends with an out gay man who'd clearly had a serious unrequited eros-and-agape love for Mark.

The main reason that this one dropped from 3 to 2 for me was the music that was thematically inappropriate in most spots and often a block for dialog and good scene sound. The scene of playing around with the cop stuff would have been far stronger if the verbal silences had been filed with the sounds of Steve and Mark dancing with their lust and fear of that lust. If the actors weren't up to working with their body sounds at that level of sophistication, at least some basic heavily aroused noises would have helped viewers engage with the scene. As it is, the psuedo-metal music left me wanting to slap someone, or a least turn off whatever device was blocking the 'real' sounds.",1498348800,3,1120,4.656565656565657

6106563,3,B00GSA3K6C,"First... if I could give this a 3.5 I would, but I decided to err on the reserved side. Despite a worthy premise, the screenplay had a few crippling inconsistencies. The biggest leap of faith demanded us to believe that 2 alpha males (at least in their own minds) with a young, but bitter rivalry, suddenly abandon their disdain for each other to reveal an intense sexual attraction for each other, with no significant build up previously. It was a questionable feat in Broke Back and an even greater stretch here. The wedding scene was curiously void of any conflict and unpleasantness that would have been triggered at a real wedding. I've seen more reaction from a cast when an ice cream cone topples to the floor. Yet here everyone just seems to say inwardly "".. O well, okay... "". Really?
The character, Steve, failed to develop sufficient depth, most of which should have been fleshed out earlier rather than later, but Eric makes a valiant effort to give Steve substance as the script allowed. Mark was emotionally difficult to nail down, and although Gregor's acting was perfectly believable in most of his scenes, it didn't always seem like the same character. The supporting cast was rather flat in their portrayals, defaulting more to the script and the leads' pretty faces than the competent delivery of their lines.
The cinematography was superb, and visual editing, crisp. The engaging original score and songs, crucial to the film's pace, prevented a cliche descent that would have resulted from the use of commercial radio tunes. Sound editing and audio levels were out of sync in half a dozen places, with the music often overpowering dialogue, none of which can be dismissed if we are to follow the storyline. In at least 3 places I had to rewind and adjust the volume to hear what was said.
Also on the plus side, the chemistry between Steve and Mark was more than adequate, and their kissing/intimate scenes definitely NOT laborious. And for many of us, a good bit of passionate hot guy on other hot guy action covers a multitude of ""meh"".

This story has been extracted from a series of books written by a female author (G.A. Hauser) who believed (rightfully so) that there was a shortage of good ""bromance"" or gay male romance stories. Not only are the two main leads (3-dimensionally and brilliantly played by Eric Presnall and Gregor Cosgrove) physically captivating, they also engage us emotionally. The supporting cast - a sister, a former female lover, a female fiance, a gay roommate, a boss, and several co-workers - is likewise excellent and not just ciphers.

This movie, while not the worst I've ever seen, certainly does not deserve the high ratings it received. I can only assume that the strong ratings are from the family members of the individuals involved in bringing this product to market.

The story is not believable--at all.  The dialog is cliched and contrived--see previous comment about lack of believability. The principal characters lack chemistry--again, not believable. The sex scenes were cringe-inducing--did I mention not believable? However, the VERY handsome actors are shirtless for a large portion of the movie, which was nice. The sets were decent--even though the office building on the outside was a high-rise and from the inside was at most a mid-rise (oops, believability again). The audio quality was relatively decent, despite some bad looping during the beach scene.  Finally there were two gratuitous penis shots that, well, didn't ring true.

6106647,1,B00GSA3K6C,"Since I have read the Capital Games book, I want to start out by reviewing this movie much the way I initially viewed it: as the film adaptation to the much loved book. Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, this movie is far removed from the book - so much so that I had a hard time finding anything that resembled any of the things I came to appreciate and admire about the book's characters and their stories. So this will be brief:

None of the main characters look like, sound like or resemble their respective characters in the book. The settings are quite different and even several of the tertiary characters are only vague shadows of their book selves. This was disappointing, you would think with the author of the book producing the film, you would get a decent adaptation of the story already told, apparently not.

With this in mind I will simply move on to my third viewing of this movie (I couldn't even finish the second viewing, I just lost all interest) - the one I just finished - in which I viewed this as a stand-alone movie with no book comparison (and I made myself not only finish the movie, but take notes).
What this movie IS:

* Capital Games is a movie about two men who supposedly fall in love with each other. (I say supposedly because you really have to suspend all logic to believe the story you see in this movie shows two men falling in love - I don't see it at all.)
* The movie is an independent film's attempt to portray a gay relationship. In other words, it's gay film, which in this day and age is still a feat in and of itself so one star for that hurdle. Again, not done well, but it's still out there.

And... that's about it. Now for what it is not:

The Capital Games movie is not very good. Most namely, the production value on this movie is weak, sophomoric and cringe-worthy at best. Even Ms. Hauser herself, per her blog, stated the following when speaking about CG while discussing the making of her next film:

 ""Beginning pre-production with a team so powerful it makes Capital Games look like a college film. And perhaps that is all it was. A learning experience for me.""

If the producer knows the movie's substandard then that alone should be a huge red flag!

The acting by the two main characters, Presnall and Cosgrove, do give a performance that seems to be a study in their trying their best in a very flawed atmosphere. Although their efforts are laudable, they do not have the chemistry to carry the story on their own merits. The initial kissing scene is indeed long, but not hot, sexy or remotely romantic (to be fair, romantic probably isn't what they were going for, but who knows it's really hard to tell with this movie). Directly after the initial kissing scene is the big ""first time sex""-scene where they... give each other a hand job? I'm guessing the college intern wrote that in - it reminded me of something you would see in a fraternity porn flick. In other scenes you either have Mark and Steve screaming hatred for each other, at each other, or gazing upon each other lovingly like they are in puppy-love. One particular scene has them smiling at each other giddily in the elevator at work and kissing tenderly, but they had just a scene or two before been screaming at each other. The elevator kissing scene was so off base it was as if the editor said ""hey look what I found on the cutting room floor, let's just stick it here"".

The movie's editing and camera work is about ten degrees shy of awful. You have close up shots of Steve taking off his shoes after a sweaty run - why? Who wants to see that, and how does it explain anything? There's tiresome overhead shower shots of Steve - not sure why. Lots of Steve inside his car just driving around, changing radio stations - really?  In other words, tons of ""padding"" in this movie! Seriously, you could have cut out about half of this movie and still gotten the gist of things. It's misplaced shots like these and the cock shots (2 if I remember, and I'm trying not to) that are so unnecessary it's mind boggling as to what the editing team - if there even was one - was thinking (or not thinking). And then there's the odd ""body shots"": of someone's mouth while on the phone, of feet (I think I mentioned that, but it bears repeating) and then this long, slow shot that runs down the back of Mark's back while he lays in Steve's bed, while Steve looks on smiling (can you say cheesy?), and I don't know who directed, or even wanted that shot, but if I was the actor I would have wanted it cut out. It was not a flattering shot of a reasonably attractive man and I'm pretty sure any first year college student could have told them that.

The tertiary characters are where the acting really lacked (to put it kindly): Sharon, Sonya, Jack Larsen, Steve's sister and most especially the actor who played Charlie are wooden and distracting. Yes, Shane Keough who plays Jack is a very nice looking man, but unfortunately that's not enough here. And don't even get me started on Steve's dad; his line about ""I guess you want dark meat"" (not verbatim, but I am not going back to check it) was not only delivered like they pulled some guy off the street to do his part, but really? That line is awful! Who wrote that and thought it was good?

Believe it or not, with all of the above said, the one thing that distracted me the most and made me want to stop the the movie mid-stream more than once was the music and sound editing! It's second rate and reminds you of a porn movie (and I'm pretty sure that was not intended). Through most of the movie the music is too loud or there are sounds that play over dialogue. In one scene, that I'm pretty sure was suppose to be sexy, Steve is frisking Mark for fun and all you hear is this awful music, then you see Steve say something in Mark's ear but you can't hear it because the music is playing over it, but apparently it's important because Mark abruptly turns around and shoves Steve and tells him to get off him! So what did Steve say? That was kind of important don't you think?! If you want an idea of just how bad the music/sound is in this movie, watch the trailer - the trailer gives you a perfect example of the music in this film, the atrocious dialogue and the uninteresting characters. If you think the trailer is ""top notch""/award winning stuff, then you might... kind of... maybe like the movie. I'm pretty confident that's not going to happen.

I don't know how this movie got 5 star reviews. I'm going to assume that these people either are relatives of the cast/crew/producer, part of the fan club or have never watched a gay-themed film that was really and truly great, or even just good. If you want a great gay movie about men falling in love, beating the odds in a difficult culture with great acting, chemistry, production values, directing, etc. you want to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Falls-Testament-of-Love/dp/B00F98FOPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Falls: Testament of Love</a>&nbsp;and the preceding movie, The Falls. These two movies are written and directed by Jon Garcia and are nothing short of brilliant!

Please make sure you read all of the reviews, both the good, bad and the ugly along with the raves. I also would advise NOT to buy this movie, like I had to, because now I have a movie in my video library that I will NEVER watch again. For some reason, and I'm pretty sure I know why, it was decided not to make this movie available to rent so to be able to review it I had to buy it - wonderful.

6106654,1,B00GSA3K6C,"I'm all for brave, low budget, passionately made film projects (I majored in film making in college many years ago). But this film really pushed me beyond my endurance. I really, REALLY wanted to turn it off after 30 mins, it was so dire. But I gave it a go, as I could see it was a project made with love and I respect that. However I'm writing this review to balance the scores of 5 star reviews on here. So this is how I arrived at my 1 star rating ......

- 1 star for this film being made. It's great to see that projects like this still get made, and we're given something more than mindless superhero movies to watch.

- Another star for the passion that went into making it. This is definitely a labour of love.

- One more star for the cinematography. Bravo to the camera-people, it looks great for a minuscule budget film.

- Another star for the last 4 minutes of footage behind the closing credits. This was for me the best part of the film. And the final few seconds of Mark and Steve just before the credits started rolling. Beautiful!

So that makes four stars. Now for the bad .........

- Take off 1 star for the acting. Sorry, but the acting sucks big time. It's on a level with porn films, especially the bit players; Jack (OMG!! was that acting?), the boss (I've seen puppet shows more animated), the African American work colleague, and both main actors lost of the time.

- Take off 1 star for the script. I haven't read the book, but being a film this must be able to stand on its own merits, not be a companion to the book. The script is atrocious, just a few rungs up the ladder from an Ed Wood effort.

- Finally, take off 2 stars for Mark's APPALLING English accent. Dear Americans, There is no such thing as a 'British' accent. The UK has literally hundreds of different regional accents, with variations within those regional accents. As Henry Higgins pointed out, one can pinpoint a Brit's location of upbringing to the village, (and to the street in London) by their accent. Mark's accent sounded like an American trying to pass himself off as a Brit, and failing miserably. This may seem a small point, but for those of us who live in the UK this kind of brings the entire film down. In a tense dramatic moment, I was reduced to 10 minutes of hysteria brought about by his hideous accent. That dramatic moment went down the loo.

So that leaves zero stars which isn't allowed on Amazon, so I have to go back up to 1 star.

I know this review will upset many people who love this film, but maybe if enough people write 1 star reviews, the producers will look at their mistakes and make a better film next time. And I really hope they improve, as passionate film making doesn't exist anymore. I wish the makers of this film all the best in their future efforts.",1401667200,6,2791,4.329501915708812

We watch as they work through their struggles (Mark is engaged to be married; Steve just broke up with a female attorney) and realize how intense their feelings are for each other.

On the down side, it has one of the dumbest pieces of dialogue I've ever heard--""Are you gay?"" ""No"" ""Me neither""---after they got it on.
'The Nile' is not just a river in Egypt!  And the two three second instances of full frontal were jarring and subtracted rather than added to the story.

6106682,5,B00GSA3K6C,"The erotic tension in this film gets like a steambath at times, as two powerbroker alpha males discover a mutual and natural attraction in the middle of the swanky L.A. advertising office where they both work.  So how will these porcupines mate?  Very, very carefully... at first.  Then oh so passionately.

This film really tells it like it is when you a man who loves, wants, needs and defends another man.  If you aren't gay you won't get this film at all, it will seem frivolous or tedious, or amateurish.  If you are gay it's like when The Wizard of Oz goes color midway thru.  And the actors will even seem touched by the clumsy poignant grace of Bresson's people.

So this prompts my little routine on the Great Awakenings based on the Poe-ish pendulum swings of l'histoire.  We are currently in the Fifth Great Awakening of Gay Male Consciousness.  There have been four previous ones.  The first came during the ancient Greek and Roman times, and was dealt its fatal blow by the Visigoths who ushered down several centuries of darkness and brutality and various cruel and unusual punishments for the love of god.  The second great awakening was in the 17th century, Foucault did much to excavate the casual gender laxness of that period; but it came to an end with the serious men of the Enlightenment, the pursuit of empires far and wide, and the dreary churchiness of Victoriana.  The third great awakening was in the 1920s, and we know what happened there.  Adolph Hitler; say no more.  The fourth great awakening was in the 1960s and it lasted for about fifteen some years before AIDS struck.

This is the Fifth Great Awakening of Gay Male Consciousness.  Films like this one and Triple Crossed and the ones that Franco is contributing (the brother's not gay, tho) and Carter and Calson and all the other brave, tender artists newly tongues untied and rarin' to go are laying out ex-act-ly what it's like to be a gay man.  Cutting thru the b.s.  Taking off the uniforms to show the manly beating of gayhearts.  And if these films strike some as misogynistic (and they will), it's because we as gay men are stepping out from the shadow of women.  We have invested women with our longing, our envy, our shame at letting them down somehow, and our lack of freedom.  We have suffered the heartbreak of losing closeted gays to women again and again.  Imagining a gay male world is to imagine a world largely without women, godspeed them in their own battles for liberation but their battles are not ours and our battles are not theirs.  Sometimes we will even have to fight our battles over and against womanism and feminism, and they as well.  The consciousness that identifies a specific group cannot exist in the shadow and shackles of the consciousness of a different specific group.  The ""united front"" of gays and women against patriarchy and heterosexism has been more or less a convenient lie of academic queer-theory orthodoxy.  It never withstood the light of day...  Or rather, we see enough light at the end of that tunnel now that we can define an interpenetrative consciousness that is proudly male, proudly sexual, and proudly gay.

So, gay men, enjoy this Fifth Great Awakening while it lasts, however long that is, because if l'histoire teaches us anything it's that it will be dark, dire, dirty and worse on the other side.  Love to my brothers.",1397260800,2,3370,4.701365187713311

No one in it can act. The leads are barely touching in their first sex scene. That scene also includes a completely unnecessary dick shot. I'm all for male nudity in films, especial my gay films, but this shot was like a kid looking and quickly looking away from something he wasn't supposed to see. There are a some shots that are completely rushed and make the film feel choppy.

Back to the leads. They insta-hate each other. The hate is over the top. Their talks always go from trying to be intense constantly to screaming with no in-between. That's kind of the whole move for me from here to there with no build in the middle. These two have one shot that's believable so far. They're in the office and the chemistry is actual there for a bit. Then out lead gets all stalker like. They've had one encounter and stalking is happening?

6106702,2,B00GSA3K6C,"OK, clearly my opinion is at odds with the majority of reviews for this movie, but diversity is a good thing.

Firstly, psycho: that's who must've written the dreadful script and then believed it would make a good movie.  There was no character development which made their actions and motives unbelievable.

Secondly, thriller: I have to say I was thrilled when it finished so I didn't have to squirm with discomfort &/or stifle yawns.

Thirdly, romance: this was supposedly meant to be a romantic movie about two supposedly straight men falling in love.  There was nothing remotely romantic about it.  The characters were one-dimensional, and the one over-played by Gregor Cosgrove seemed Schizophrenic and about as romantic as three-day-old pizza.  The actors also seemed to be physically uncomfortable in each others' presence, hence absolutely no chemistry.  To be fair, even the best actors would have failed to bring this dismal script and story to a higher level.

Finally, comedy: yes, it was so bad as to be almost comical.

A lot of reviews make reference to the book, which I have not read and which should be irrelevant - the movie should be able to stand on its own.  Unfortunately, for me, it doesn't.  The script writer, author and executive producer is G A Hauser, who I assume is a woman.  Why is it that so many women think they can write convincingly about gay men ?  Surely there are other LGBT books more deserving of a transfer to the screen ?

I guess in summary, desperately trying to find something positive to say, two stars for trying, but I certainly wouldn't recommend spending 97 minutes of your life watching this.",1390953600,6,1646,4.807829181494662

6106704,4,B00GSA3K6C,"This is a gay romance and like all romances there are star-crossed lovers who must overcome barriers, obstacles, and challenges to reach each other. Being a romance, the primary focus is on the lovers, in this case two young men who work for the same advertising company, and thus other characters in the film have as their function the ability to hinder the romance or facilitate it or to be the friend to whom the protagonists open their hearts and thus open their hearts to the viewers of the film.

Well this film is pure romance and for those who wish to see handsome men overcoming obstacles, including their own prejudices and self-definitions, to find each other, then this is the film for you.

Steve Miller, an ex-policeman turned advertising man, is played well by Eric Presnall. Steve finds himself in competition with a bright, ambitious, dashing young man, Mark Richfield, played well by Gregor Cosgrove.  These two men are very handsome in very different ways. Presnall is very all-American with a short blond haircut and a military look. Cosgrove, with his long hair and compact muscular body, is a great physical compliment to Presnall. One thing I cannot understand is why the producers of the film would use a basically unflattering photograph of these two men on the cover. Presnall has a scowl and Cosgrove is squinting into the sun. There were so many other images of these two men together that are more revealing of the beauty of these two guys.

The film is about 90 minutes long. In truth, I felt it could have been improved a bit if it had been 2 hours long which would have allowed more conversation and process to occur which I think the film needed. One example is that Steve has self identified as a heterosexual and has had an African American girlfriend. As he realizes he is in love with Mark, wishes to continue a sexual relationship with him, he then must come in terms with his sexual orientation. This process of weighing his past sexual and romantic attachments to women and his current obsessions, both romantic and sexual, with a man all takes place while he is in an automatic car wash. The symbolism seems to be that his old past is being washed away. However a bit more process would have been welcomed. The same observation must be made for the character of Mark Richfield, a man engaged to a woman, who must navigate even more barriers than Steve to find the right person for him in life.

6106723,3,B00GSA3K6C,"I think someone's enjoyment of this movie will depend on two things: one, how much you love the Gay For You trope; and two, how much you can tolerate cheating, as one of the main characters is engaged...to a woman. Myself, I love the former, but hate the latter, so my review of ""Capital Games"" will reflect that.

Steve is a laid-back, mellow type of guy. He left the LAPD and has been working in advertising for the last five years, climbing the ladder to success. Enter one Mark Richfield, new-hire, drop dead gorgeous with a sexy accent to boot and Steve knows his days as top dog in his firm are numbered.

Steve and Mark clash from the moment they meet. Mark is a pompous, arrogant know-it-all and Steve butts heads with him 24/7. When their boss takes the office away to a ranch for ""team building"" exercises, I think Steve would rather be shot than go. When a simple exercise goes wrong and the men get stranded in the desert together overnight, things turn heated. All that love-hate emotion finally bursts and they have sex. Both men claim neither is gay, and try to put it behind them, but Steve is falling in love with Mark and with Mark's wedding looming, something has got to give.

I've been renting/watching independent films since 1989. Quirky, avant-garde is my thing, so I was excited to see that an M/M author was having a movie made from one of her best-selling books. On one hand, ""Capital Games"" is a great movie, the cast is talented (sometimes with low-budget gay films the acting is sub-par, that is not the case here). On the other, I had some issues with the plot, which is why I did not rate it higher.

First, the good things.

The production aspects on this film are top-notch. It is beautifully filmed, the sound and editing are perfection. You do not normally see this level of professionalism in low-budget movies, but ""Capital Games"" has that and more. The sights around Los Angeles are gorgeous and the aerial shots sublime. (Yes, I took a few film classes in college.) Two stars for just the cinematography.

Second, the acting, as I said, is above-average. Eric Presnall won me over as the sexually confused Steve Miller. He's so cute and his acting so believable I wanted to eat him up with a spoon! I see this guy's career taking off big-time. And while I did enjoy Gregor Cosgrove's performance as Mark, his British accent left a lot to be desired, so if you can get over that, you will probably like his Mark Richfield. Plus, the chemistry the two men shared on screen was burning hot. The nailed the enemies-to-lovers trope perfectly. I added another star for just them. The casting department really hit the jackpot with these two.

Now, we have to move to my reservations. While I loved the directing and acting in ""Capital Games,"" the screenplay felt unfinished and disjointed which is why I couldn't rate it higher than 3.5 stars. I read the ""Capital Games"" book many moons ago, so I had a vague idea what the movie would be about. And while it does follow very closely to the novel, the movie does leave out what I felt were some of the most important aspects of the book, namely Mark's relationship with Jack, his roommate, and Steve's dysfunctional dynamic with his bigoted father, a former LAPD cop himself.

With only 97 minutes, I know a movie cannot cover everything in a book, Stephen King's novels are a great example of that. But if I were just viewing the movie, never knowing about the book, I would have a hard time following the plot. There were many inconsistencies that were never fully explained and characters who were never developed (Jack). At times I was very confused about what was going on. For example, in a flashback scene, you see an older man pull a gun on Steve and his ex-girlfriend in front of a coffee shop. That is not explained until towards the end, when its revealed the ""older man"" was Steve's dad! Now I know from the book, that action got Steve's father an early retirement, but the whys and hows were never explained in the movie. It just hung out there confusing me.

Another example was after Mark and Steve slept together in the desert, Steve becomes this Edward Cullen-like stalker of Mark. It was a tad creepy and made me want to tell Mark to get a restraining order against Steve. Hey, I like Insta-Love plots, but this was one hand-job...not sure how you can go from that to: ""I love you, leave your fiancee."" In one scene, Mark is telling Steve to leave him alone, stop touching him, then in practically the next scene they are making out in their work elevator like the previous conversation never happened! Continuity-wise those scenes did not flow together properly, so viewers who have not read the book I think would go: WTH?

Plus, Mark had some huge mood swings in this movie and while the I-want-you-I-don't-want-you can be entertaining, this push and pull was too schizophrenic for me. Mark yelled a lot and then kissed Steve, pushed him away, yelled some more, then kissed him again. I think you get my point. It was a little too soap opera-ish for me.

Now, I did say the movie had some hot sex scenes and it did. Mark and Steve should get an MTV Award for Best Kiss in a Movie. I do believe some tongue was involved. The sex scenes are not for the prudish. Yes, we've all seen simulated sex on screen, some bad, some good; but Capital Games took it to a new level by showing Mark and Steve kissing, caressing, then cut away scenes to actual simulated sex. (I had to re-watch it twice to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. For research purposes, of course. *g*)

Hey, I did say it had hot sex scenes! So, depending on what you are comfortable with, this movie strays into the NC-17 arena. I admit I gave the movie an extra .5 stars for delving into risque territory. It felt very ""9 1/2 Weeks"" to me.

My last niggle was the ending. I don't want to give it away, but it does end exactly like the book. So if you enjoyed that, you will like this. But that ending was the main reason I didn't love the book. Yes, with a love triangle, someone is going to wind up alone and hurt, but I think that could have been avoided by editing the end of the movie to portray Mark as a more caring, compassionate individual by not doing what he did!

So, overall, I did like many aspects of ""Capital Games."" I think fans of Ms. Hauser's Action series will love this movie. But for the average gay-themed movie watcher, there are some niggles. Not enough for me to advise against renting/buying it, but still some reservations that makes the movie not join my Top Ten Gay-Themed Films list.

6106724,4,B00GSA3K6C,"When I was in college, there was an brilliant but eccentric chartacter on campus who was loved by everyone for his candor and honesty. However, when he observed anything that appeared inauthentic on some level, he'd scream repeatedly, ""Mass confusion, just mass confusion, honey!"" Looking back, he was more than accurate in every account of his keen observations.

Capital Games is a film filled with ""mass confusion"" early on. The story line is clear but the character's motives and initiatives are chaotic and often unsettling. Yet, the extremely attractive, correction:sexy, beautiful, and masculine, male leads are alluring enough to hold your attention to see what eventually happens in this cornucopia of denial, disruption, misleading appearances, and ""deception""?  Buckle up cause it gets even more chaotic and inauthentic.

I did not like the ""lost scene"" and the scene mechanics when the two leads finally ""connect."" Something simply did not work, whether it was the suddeness in direction or the director's attempt to creative a visual for a more realistice ""first time"" for both characters. The acting slips and the dynamics add to the inauthenticity I cited earlier.

CG is not a perfect film, but let me get to my point before I lose it. THIS IS THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.

The film is sexy and diverse and pushes all the button, homophobia, racism, bigotry, and family rejection, yet, still though full of contradictions. By the way, why to beautiful men who think they are straight go after the most unattractive women?)

As a film with a happy ending it is less predicatble than it is a take-off of scenarios we've all seen before. At least in Sex in the City, Bigg never enetered the church, and I still hold that writer/director ploy sacred.

After learning it is a film based on an AG Hauser novel and characters, I still have mixed emotions and strong feelings about women writing about the men who sleep with men experience. On the other hand, I will seek out her work in the future to see if she can remain effective in her authenticity of the angst, stress, and love true to male/male relations. That is a plus for her.

Don't miss out, BUY THE DAMNED DVD. If you don't, you'll be sorry and will missed a low, budget independent gem. View with few expectations and come way pleased as I was. In fact, I'm off to tell others and view it again and again.",1388534400,,2398,4.77536231884058

but I would live it all again! because I've seen a few times a story so addictive ..
having read the book I was afraid that the story took a different turn and I would have felt the absence of my favorite characters .. but it did not happen, anything but!
the movie is great! I had the distinct feeling that the words of the book come to life right in front of my eyes!
I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to continue to dream ..

6106741,5,B00GSA3K6C,"This movie starts out as very adversarial then morphs into a romantic movie that is quite poignant.  It is well acted, the characters are believable in their performances; however, the story line is definitely fiction and highly unlikely to ever occur in the real world, one could only hold out hope that such a story line could play out in real life. It is a fun movie and well worth adding to your collection.",1387152000,,411,4.554054054054054

6106743,2,B00GSA3K6C,"I am livid!!! This has been on my wish list since it was released as a DVD. I'm just now getting around to buying it for myself for a Holiday gift and it's UNDER REVIEW? For what? Because it's a gay romance? Just how far are you going to take this censorship thing? Has Amazon turned homophobic? Good grief, what's next, pulling all the gay romance books??? I am one angry Amazon customer!

I buy a LOT of books from you. I own over 2300 ebooks and about 200 audio books. I'd hate to take my business elsewhere, it would be very difficult, but I'll do it if Amazon doesn't start acting like adults. Adults who honor our First Amendment, equality, and diversity.

6106755,5,B00GSA3K6C,I love GA Hauser!!! When I heard she was making a movie out of one of her books I was so excited. I bought the DVD and was happy I did. She came through expertly. I have read pretty much every book she has written and this movie was an extension of how great she is. I could feel the emotions of Mark and Steve. Those two were excellant choices. They did a great job!!! I highly recommend this movie whether you are a fan or not. It is a beautiful love story. I can't wait to see what else she does.,1386288000,,499,3.9019607843137254

6106757,4,B00GSA3K6C,"I was so excited to hear that G.A Hauser was making a film adaptation for her fabulous book, Capital Games.  I've read it many times and love the red hot chemistry and love between the two MC's, Mark (Gregor Cosgrove) and Steve ( Eric Presnall).  The movie did not disappoint.
So many of us Hauser fans have been following Mark and Steve's life in the Action Series, and were thrilled to know that they would be brought to life on the big screen.  I was sceptical that a real life Mark could be found though.  Gregor Cosgrove did not disappoint, and really impressed me in his astute portrayal of the Mark Richfiled. Plus...he's is really, really easy on the eyes. ;)
If your looking for a gay romance movie that has a happily ever after (an unfortunate rarity in the genre) than you'll enjoy this movie.
I hope more Hauser novels make their way to film adaptation.  Maybe one featuring gorgeous Shane Keough!?! Wink.wink.
Great job Ms. Hauser! You rocked it.",1385769600,,959,4.584795321637427
6106758,4,B00GSA3K6C,"I loved Capital Games, I read the book at least 5 times. It was very romantic I'm in love with Steven Jay Miller. Mark and Steve make a perfect couple. even though there relationship got off to a rocky start.  the sex between them then and now is fantastic, every time they make love it gives me goose flesh. They are so passionately in love with each other and Steven would do anything for Mark. Eric Presnall (Steve) and Gregor Cosgrove (mark) did a great job, however the spark I was looking for was not there. so I was just a little under whelmed. To me the movie liked passion. and if you have read any of the books in GAHs action series you know Mark and Steve's relationship is  all about passion, Steve can not keep his hands off of Mark.

Of course it showed up on an evening I had plans to attend a home opener for a local sports team.  I promised myself I'll watch 30 minutes and go.  Thirty became forty five and forty five became I am not hitting the pause button.

Just like the book, I could not put it down or in this case press the pause button.  The movie runs very close to the book and I was not disappointed when it didn't.  The characters were correctly cast and very engaging.  The bonus feature was a pleasant surprise and also very informative.

Not to be a spoiler but i was surprised to find out Ms. Hauser had a bit part in the movie.  Shame on you from hiding it from your fans. :)",1385510400,2,774,4.1066666666666665
6106760,5,B00GSA3K6C,"Ive almost given up the majority of GLBT films that come out. Yes, its a good thing they're being made, only the acting tends to be subpar, the direction non-existent and/or the writing absolutely horrific. Fortunately, having read G.A. Hausers novels for many years now, I know a project won't receive her stamp of approval or her name unless its worth sharing. Thats why I gave Capital Games a chance.

Former LAPD officer Steve Miller works for an advertising firm and is up to take over a major account, only the company hires a major snarky, obnoxious, self-centered, arrogant Brit named Mark Richfield. And with a name like that, you just know the man is going to be troubleand not because hes British. Its because his name is Mark. Theyre all mildly psychotic, especially the ones whose last name are Richfield.

So, yes, chaos ensues, tempers flare, and the questions of whos gay, who isnt, whos getting married and whos in denial are all asked. As for the answers, youll have to watch for yourself. Im not going to spoil the fun.

Capital Games still falls within the realm of a low-budget production, but its obvious this is a work of love. Miss Hauser and team get a great deal of bang for the buck; the acting is strong, especially from the two leads and especially Gregor Cosgrove as Mark, the money is on the screen in terms of locations and the score is solid (most productions like this skimp on a decent score).

Im sincerely hoping this isn't the only time well see characters from the G.A. Hauser universe come to life. Nicely done.",1385337600,2,1551,4.629090909090909

6106762,5,B00GSA3K6C,"GA Hauser, the Queen of M/M erotic romance novels is proving herself to also be the Queen of M/M erotic romance movies. This adaptation of her book, Capital Games, the prequel novel to her series of 14 books in her Action series, truly brings the key characters of Mark, Steve and Jack to life.  The opening scene of Steve doing his daily jog is so hot that I could have spent the entire 90 or so minutes of the film just watching that opening scene.  Glad that I could not do that, because the rest of the film was so good, I would not have wanted to miss it, nor should you. All three actors portraying Mark, Steve and Jack were excellent.  Mark and Steve initially disliking each other because of their competition for the same promotion at their advertising agency morphing into a deep love for each other was totally convincing.  As was the distress of both Mark and Steve when Mark is determined to prove to his friends and family that he is not gay by marrying his very demanding fiance whom he is coming to dislike intensely. I will not give away the dramatic climax to the movie, though you who have read the book are aware of it.  I also will not reveal the details of the extremely erotic scenes except to mention both the humor and intense sexuality of the scene when Steve wears his uniform from when he was an LA cop knowing that Mark has a police fetish. This DVD is a must have for those of you who, like myself, love this genre and particularly those who love GA's wonderful books. It would also make a great Christmas gift for any friends or relatives who enjoy M/M love stories.",1385251200,9,1597,4.363636363636363

Well done Ms. Hauser in keeping this movie true to your book and well done on the lyrics to the original music.
The choice of the main cast is well done and the actors did a great job that drew me into the story. If you desire to watch a true love story then this is the movie for you and if you want to know what happens later with the men of CAPITAL GAMES check out the novels of GA Hauser.
