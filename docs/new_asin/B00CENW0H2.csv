5719606,5,B00CENW0H2,"I've really enjoyed watching this anime. As always, it holds great fights, humor, loyalty and romance. This season didn't have as much romantic action as the first one did but enough to keep you interested. In episodes 17 - 26, you really see Rikuo grow into the Yokai he's always meant to be. As usual, his friends are nuts. If you liked the first season, you'll love this season as well. Can't wait for Season 2 part 1!!",1377043200,,422,4.423076923076923

5719699,5,B00CENW0H2,"AND Season one was a breathe of fresh air IMO for the dubbed anime community. I've already extensively reviewed the whole series in my Demon Capital Set 1 (Amazon Instant but also posted under the physical release) - and shorter review of Nura: Rise of The Yokai Clan Set 1. This series sold me immediately on the name, description, its cover artwork (esp the amazon instant artwork which is more like Set 2, across the board - than the red covers of Set 1 and the physical copy of Demon Capital) and the fact that it touches on many of my favorite ""tropes"" if you will (may be using that word incorrectly) - in Anime. The correct use of mythology, mysticism/religion (in this case Onmyodo - ""The Way of Ying and Yang"" which in itself is a development of the Chinese system of Wu Xing and the Ying/Yang - aswell as influenced (heavily in my opinon) by Shintoism, Taoism and Buddhism (lesser with the latter). Aswell as the right cultural atmosphere/sociological-psychology of these eras/periods in Japanese history. The idea of a clan of either demons (ayakashi/yokai - Im still not sure what the difference is, quick wiki could probably clear that up - but I just know Yokai are the 'good' demons - the main characters - and Ayakashi seem to be the 'bad' demons, other than that they both seem alike in their abilities, but differ in their goals). Whilst the Onmyodo practioners (Onmyojji) are there to protect the people, their safe gaurds (temples, shrines, pagodas, seals, castles) against the Ayakashi and rogue Yokai. Well I was right - there is really no different other than terminology according to wikipedia

""Ykai (?, ghost, phantom, strange apparition) are a class of supernatural monsters in Japanese folklore. The word ykai is made up of the kanji for ""bewitching; attractive; calamity"" and ""apparition; mystery; suspicious"".

They can also be called ayakashi (?), mononoke (?), or mamono (?). Ykai range eclectically from the malevolent to the mischievous, or occasionally bring good fortune to those who encounter them. Often they possess animal features (such as the Kappa, which is similar to a turtle, or the Tengu which has wings), other times they can appear mostly human, some look like inanimate objects and others have no discernible shape. Ykai usually have a spiritual supernatural power, with shapeshifting being one of the most common. Ykai that have the ability to shapeshift are called obake.

Japanese folklorists and historians use ykai as ""supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants"". In the Edo period, many artists, such as Toriyama Sekien, created ykai inspired by folklore or their own ideas, and in the present, several ykai created by them (e.g. Kameosa and Amikiri, see below) are wrongly considered as being of legendary origin.""

In Nura: Rise of The Yokai Clan - it seems evident that the Yokai are mostly the mischevious/helpful kind, and the ayakashi are malevolent for the most part. The Kappa is one of the more interesting of the Yokai (the Japanese name for this being - and the most prevelant Yokai noted in Japan), - that seems to have corresponding creatures/beings - across most of Eurasia, mostly in the orient but even stretching as far into Scandanavian/Germanic/Norse mythology, Finnish Mythology and even Scottish Mythology aswell as Cryptozoology where they're refered to as - like most Cryptzoological 'creatures' are - a ""cryptid.""

""Kappa (?, ""river-child""), alternatively called Kawatar (?, ""river-boy""), Komahiki (horse puller), or Kawako (?, ""river-child""), are a ykai found in Japanese folklore, and also a cryptid. Their name comes from a mixture of the word ""kawa"" (river) and ""wappo,"" an inflection of ""waraba"" (child). In Shint they are considered to be one of many suijin (,water deity), their yorishiro, or one of their temporary appearances.[4] A hair-covered variation of a Kappa is called a Hysube (?).[5] There are more than eighty other names associated with the kappa in different regions which include Kawappa, Gawappa, Kgo, Mizushi, Mizuchi, Enk, Kawaso, Suitengu, and Dangame.[3] Along with the oni and the tengu, they are one of the most well-known ykai in Japan.

Kappa are similar to Finnish Nkki, Scandinavian/Germanic Nck/Neck, Slavian Vodnk and Scottish Kelpie in that all have been used to scare children of dangers lurking in waters.

It has been suggested that the kappa legends are based on the Japanese giant salamander or ""hanzaki"", an aggressive salamander which grabs its prey with its powerful jaws.""

Didnt want to repeat my self endlessly having reviewed it twice already (once extensively for Demon Capital Set 1 and a smaller review for Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan Set 1) but did want to give the series its just dues. So I figured a little background on the mythology of it all - which is all based on facts from that time period - would be atleast interesting.",1395619200,,4880,5.023485784919654
5719700,5,B00CENW0H2,"This was amazing and some parts were so heart touching that I was like ""awww no it wasn't his fault why?"" and was just great. It had a sad yet at same time touching ending and it like ""aww"" the fight scenes are epic and very gripping. I had a hard time looking away from the screen when watching.

I would recommend it to anyone who is into Japanese anime, samurai's, fight of good verses evil, jealous bodyguard, and the heart touching of a misguided character meeting tragedy but then perhaps finding a second chance at happiness, the only thing that misguided person wanted was happiness and acceptance among others.",1392249600,,619,4.627272727272727
5719701,5,B00CENW0H2,"This is an amazing series. I was captivated from the first episode. It's funny, serious, romantic, and so much more.",1383696000,2,116,4.85
5719702,5,B00CENW0H2,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
5719703,5,B00CENW0H2,"This review will be for the Blu-ray release meaning I cannot speak for what is on the DVD version. Although it is usually the same exact release. - May contain spoilers so read at your own risk!

Just like with the first part of this series I feel like it had very slow pacing. It took a good amount of episodes to get to where it had to be, a lot of talking and even an episode that felt like a filler episode. I feel like this part took a little bit longer to get down to the action and really good content than the first part did. With the Gyuuki arc in Part 1, it only took about 5-6 episodes max to really get into the Gyuuki arc. Although we did have the introduction episode to getting to know some of the yokai, Rikuo and his human friends, etc. before the Gyuuki arc fully began something about the pacing in Part 1 was much better than this final part. What I'm trying to get across is that this final part has a lot of talking, potentially boring moments, and even a meaningless episode with one of Rikuo's human classmates. Like, this episode came out of no where, did not advance the plot in any way and even back slight background information on a character that is literally useless for the rest of this season and the next one. I'm not sold on the fact that it was actually canon material. - Hell, it really may be a filler episode, I didn't bother to do any research on it. Once you get this set and view it for yourself hopefully you will understand the episode I'm referring to here. I'd prefer to give as little spoilers as possible, meaning I won't get much more into it than that.

Seeing Rikuo's dedication and power as the new Lord of Pandemonium is strongly presented and shown in this final set. As the war between the two night parades draws closer, Rikuo's courage and resolve as the new leader is tested more than ever. If you thought his speech and resolve after the Gyuuki arc was strong and pretty impressive, than you're in for a special treat with this set. Rikuo's yokai form takes awesome to a whole new place within every episode. - His night form is actually what encouraged me to get into this series at all, actually. I'm a huge InuYasha lover and this series had it's special moments in it for me. Rikuo did not disappoint in this set one bit.

This is the same release format as the previous set. Two standard Blu-ray discs with nice artwork on them, a Neon Alley advertisement inside and all of that. Nothing special at all. The only extras are some character artwork, creditless opening 2 and that's really it.. nothing to write home about. The quality for the Blu-ray release is still just as good, no complaints from me about it.

I honestly want to give this box set a 10/10 simply because I love Rikuo and all of the main characters.. but it really does not deserve it in any way. I'd give it roughly a 6 or 7 out of 10. This box set lacks any real extra features, standard boring release and nothing new. The episodes and quality were good but were very slow paced and even somewhat boring. Hopefully my review doesn't turn you away from watching and buying this set, because I really did not intend for that to happen if it did. I loved this box set and the series as a whole, so if you've seen part one then do give this final set a shot and base your own opinion on it. I'm just giving mine as a possible warning to new buyers of the set.

This is the final set for season one until Sennen Makyou / Demon Capital is released sometime next year (I'm assuming).",1378252800,,3511,4.281626506024097
