8465223,4,B001S852S8,"After ordering a couple of DVD's from this series, I was not disappointed.

The information comes first-hand, but how much value it would add for the series, be it accompanied with English subtitles: it is very difficult to understand what they are talking about (even for audience that is close to the overall concept and numerous subject-specific terms), which is rather annoying.

On the other side, the music is great, and will surely enlight enthusiasts looking for keys to the Carnatic musical tradition, although somewat less approachable for English-speakers.",1340668800,,567,5.359550561797753
8465224,5,B001S852S8,There's not many resources available on this subject and this DVD series comes as a blessing for aspiring carnatic singers to develop/polish up their Manodharma skills. TRS Sir has done a marvellous job of compiling this complicated set of topics and making it an enjoyable learning experience.,1266105600,3,294,5.276595744680851
