8415073,4,B0043KX3N4,"In honor of my 'big 3-0' today, and this show's 25th anniversary this year, here's a review of Goof Troop volumes 1 and 2 on DVD! The first 54 episodes of Goof Troop are in these 2 3-disc DVD sets, including the show's Halloween special! The Christmas special's not in these, but on its own DVD! Back in 2006, there was a volume 1 DVD of Goof Troop, but with only 3 shows, causing lots of anger and backlashing for fans everywhere when compared to the much bigger volume sets of Ducktales and Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, with up to 27 shows for each set! That DVD was vaulted soon afterward, but strangely, volume 1 of Quack Pack was also done that way, but it's still being made and sold new today! In 2013, the Disney Movie Club originally put these 2 volume sets in 3-disc DVD sets with 27 shows each, and they'd be out everywhere in January of 2015, just like the show's Christmas DVD, weird as it sounds! The drawbacks I noticed with these sets are the cases aren't clear but black, with no artwork or episode guides whatsoever, and the 3 discs in each set are in the center spindle with no disc trays, making the discs easily scratch each other and hard to arrange without dropping them! Lucky thing Amazon and ebay have lots of new empty DVD cases to choose from for such problems, ranging from single-disc cases to really thick 16-disc cases! You can always recycle the problematic spindle cases these sets are made in! Other than those drawbacks, Goof Troop volumes 1 and 2 are must-own sets for fans of the series old AND new! Like most other classic Disneytoon DVDs, Goof Troop's last volume set, #3 with the last 24 or 25 shows, has never surfaced on DVD! Goof Troop originally had 65 shows in 1 season, but later had another 13 shows and the 1 Christmas special in the 2nd season! You never what Goofy will mess up next, to the dismay or happiness of his son Max and his best bud PJ, Pete's son. From hereon, Pete was voiced by toon legend Jim Cummings, to this day, as Bill Farmer played Goofy and Pluto since even before I was born by at least 1 year (except for Roger Rabbit in 1988, when future House of Mouse and Digimon actor Tony Pope played Goofy, and Pluto was nowhere to be seen, as far as I can remember)! Add volumes 1 and 2 of Goof Troop to your classic Disneytoon TV show libraries today; you'll be glad you did!",1503792000,2,2339,4.330296127562642
