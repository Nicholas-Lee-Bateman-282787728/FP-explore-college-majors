2223272,3,B0007NMJD6,"HIGH LONESOME was Eagle-Lion's sequel to THE SUNDOWNERS (1950). While several cast members from the earlier film also appear in this one, most notably Chill Wills, the film lacks the ""star-power"" of a Robert Preston (or Robert Sterling). John Barrymore Jr. isn't as bad as some have written, but neither does he give the film that essential lift that it needs to be truly memorable. Still, for the price, and the fine camera work, and for Chill Wills (who always adds something), the film is worth investigating. Again, thanks to VCI gives us a handsome print..and we owe them thanks.",1156118400,,584,4.85
2223273,2,B0007NMJD6,"If you like westerns, this movie has some moments. It was filmed in the Big Bend river country of Texas on the property of 6 working ranches. The technicolor photography is rich and scenic. There are some accomplished actors giving good performances as well some servicable ones by what must be genuine ranch hands based on their looks and riding ability. Unfortunately, the story is somewhat preposterous and it's main focus is on the character played (and I use that word in it's fullest sense) by the only Barrymore who couldn't act - John Drew Barrymore, father of his middle named daughter. Because of his famous lineage, J.D. bypassed the learning process of acting experience and jumped into lead roles like this one. Other than shouting out his lines, his entire range consists of contorted facial expressions to show suprise, fear and God knows what-all. The price of admission is almost worth the laughter it provokes. Because the producers or director couldn't have failed to notice how inept his acting was, most of his scenes take place with a squeaky voiced actress who deflects attention from him by being even more annoying. Also it must be noted that if music were medication then this movie is overmedicated. The soundtrack is shrill and overbearing, particularly in the beginning.

  So what are the good points? Chill Wills gives the kind of appealing folksy performance before he became a cariacture and Basil Ruysdael as the father left me wanting to see more of him in something (anything) else. The film was directed and written by Alan LeMay who can be forgiven for this since his story was the source for Ford's  ""The Searchers"". And there's the landscape spread out over 6 ranches, from arroyos to plains to riversides. As for John Drew Barrymore- well, he's got beautiful blue eyes and a great head of hair which as Mick Jagger once said is all you need to be a rock star.  Not a film star.",1149811200,4,1918,4.782477341389728
2223274,3,B0007NMJD6,"The credits are most intriguing: Eagle-Lion London-financed production, Alan Le May, Big Bend locations, Technicolor, Jack Elam--and perhaps Barrymore Jr., presciently channeling Sean Penn. These credits and the characters' names (Cooncat, Boatwhistle, Roper, Horse, Smiling Man) do suggest one of those offbeat postwar Westerns without John Wayne, much peacetime angst, noirish dark shadows and perhaps archetypical parables for McCarthy Era paranoiacs. The best of those films are BLOOD ON THE MOON, PURSUED, COLORADO TERRITORY, THE FURIES and SILVER LODE--all leading up to JOHNNY GUITAR and ultimately to THE SEARCHERS. Alan Le May (1899-1964) wrote the novel on which Ford based THE SEARCHERS, and here Le May, directing straight from his own script, remotely prefigures themes, motifs and high, lonely landscapes we'll find considerably amplified and perfected in Ford's great masterpiece of 1956.

Le May, like James M. Cain, was a surprisingly fine writer on very filmable tropes (this is a solid script, poorly acted) but had little notion of how to direct or how to edit down a superfluity of rather beautiful location footage. Every scene runs slightly overlong, giving the film a lumpy rhythm, and the bargain-basement cast seem bewildered and not quite on top of the script complexities. Junior Barrymore's performance as outcast drifter Cooncat is not bad, Chill Wills rocks the barn party with his greatest hit, the rather butch cowgirls Lois Butler and Kristine Miller are surprisingly emancipated, and of course Jack Elam steals the show in the badguy role ""Smiling Man.""

Le May was no auteur but knew his Western landscapes very well, and here West Texas' Big Bend country around Alpine and Marfa (where George Stevens later shot GIANT) plays a major role and is far more interesting than the humans. I'd like to say this is a premake or preamble to THE SEARCHERS, but it's only a thematic variant thereof--a footnote to the Ford film--and certainly the least of the progressive cycle of neurotic postwar Westerns. Le May's Western mode and creds are, however, vital in fully appreciating the complexities of the Ford film. Needless to say, this is the writer's only credit as a film director. Scattered seeds that will flower extravagantly in THE SEARCHERS are found in more primitive form in HIGH LONESOME. Indeed, Le May's one film as director more resembles any late Western by the great Canadian primitivist Allan Dwan than any of Jack Ford's.

Mindful of their Eagle-Lion backers, Le May and his producer George Templeton swapped Stetsons and while in the neighborhood filmed Le May's range-war story THE SUNDOWNERS in Palo Duro Canyon outside Amarillo. Its cast credits are roughly identical, with the Roberts Preston and Sterling added on. The more scenic Big Bend shoot, clearly a vanity project for Le May, was photographed by W. Howard Greene, while the Palo Duro Technicolor cinematography is credited to Ford's great painterly cameraperson Winton C. Hoch (SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON).",1432080000,2,3014,5.24896265560166
2223275,3,B0007NMJD6,"AUUUGHH,, I DID get the b/w version, and it's a terrible transfer.  Will try again, to get the VCI  product, if, indeed, it IS in color.  Main interest in this film is Chill Wills, and his song at the barn dance.  I remember it from childhood, and it is a nice tune.  Would REALLY be great to find the complete song on a cd with other Chill Wills tunes, but, still looking for that, if it ever existed.",1431734400,,402,4.102564102564102
2223276,1,B0007NMJD6,"The film quality is terrible in this version, it was pixelated and barely visible. Why pay to watch this horrible rendition of High Lonesome when you can watch free on youtube and in color. Not worth the money.",1403913600,,210,4.552631578947368
2223277,5,B0007NMJD6,"Yes, this copy of the film is a photographic bummer, but the story has some surprising twists.  A little Hitchcock, a little Serling and Chill Wills' singing voice!  (I expected the usual gravel throat, but was treated to something smoother.)",1387238400,,242,5.025
2223278,4,B0007NMJD6,"VCI did a good job with this one.  Audio/video quality is quite good and there are no technical issues to speak of.  Despite other reviews, I still like the film and it's story.  The extra ""Stories of the Century"" episode runs 26 minutes, but it is full of dialogue splices.",1383004800,,274,4.44
2223279,3,B0007NMJD6,"Started the movie - quit. Just wasn't my cup of tea. Further, I care not for a required amount of words to send the message. Better to delete the request for comments.",1382400000,,167,4.25
2223280,1,B0007NMJD6,"The quality of this picture was so poor that I had to abandon early on.  I skipped ahead hoping to see improvement, but no such luck.
I remember our old 1950s era Philco television (needless to say, black and white) whose picture tube was on its way out.  Believe me, the old Philco had better video quality than this.  Too bad, too, because it looked like an interesting movie.",1380672000,,378,4.449275362318841
2223281,5,B0007NMJD6,"I thought the movie was well written, well acted and well directed. The movie had a great storyline, full of suspense. A real WHO is the killer kind of thing. I really enjoyed it.",1367280000,2,179,4.294117647058823
2223282,4,B0007NMJD6,"John Barrymore Jr., or John Drew Barrymore, is listed in this matinee-type western at the mid-century mark of the twentieth-century as the top name. Why? He doesn't have much to do but play a confused kid, apparently left over from THE SUNDOWNERS. He doesn't even get to shoot anybody. When he is offered that opportunity, his gun is out of bullets.

Okay. He has a family name important to earlier movies. Does that mean anything to fans of Saturday afternoon westerns, even in 1950?
John Archer, clearly the lead in this film, is billed beneath Barrymore. He is a stalwart type -- masculine and tough-looking and capable of handling the leading man chores. He even shows up as the town physician in one of the better Randolph Scott westerns, DECISION AT SUNDOWN, appearing at the end of the same decade. Anyway, in HIGH LONESOME, referring to the mountain range that is of some significance to the characters in THE SUNDOWNERS, he must play second banana to Barrymore.

Barrymore has had an interesting, if less than significant, career in films. Some viewers might remember him from THE NIGHT OF THE QUARTER MOON, but fans of the Italian spectaculars of the early sixties will know him as an ex-pat actor in such films as THE TROJAN HORSE, THE CENTURIAN, and WAR OF THE ZOMBIES (later retitled ROME AGAINST ROME). His role as Ulysses (Odysseus for you Greek classic purists) is noteworthy only for his outrageous costume as the great Greek warrior who dreams up the idea of the Trojan horse and for his stage-acting which is so mannered and over-articulated that it seems not to belong with the dubbed Italian actors. Fortunately for Steve Reeves as the top-billed Trojan hero Aeneas, they share only one short scene together.

In HIGH LONESOME, it might have been better if his voice had been dubbed.

Again, this Technicolor production, which looks great on DVD, particularly considering its age, begins with a testimony for the owners of real cattle ranches who permitted these two films to be shot on their property. As I mention in my review of THE SUNDOWNERS, this is an interesting tidbit of information. What is not as interesting is the plot of this film. Maybe those seeking matinee escapism didn't really care about the plot, but fans of the western genre who collect DVDs of older movies might.

Back again are the always likable Chill Wills, with his gravelly voice, and Jack Elam, this time playing a stubble-faced villain instead of the bewildered good guy that he plays in THE SUNDOWNERS.

Perhaps it is a bit irrelevant, but my non-academic side wonders what his daughter, Drew Barrymore, thinks of her father's role in these films. I wonder if she tells him that he was great, or if she sighs and says, truthfully: ""Daddy, you sucked.""

Is this film worth purchasing on DVD? I guess it depends on how much a fan you are of these mediocre matinee westerns like THE SUNDOWNERS and ALBUQUERQUE. This is not the John Ford west or the Sam Peckinpah west. This is a minor genre effort whose main saving grave is that it was filmed in fade-defying Technicolor.",1249948800,,3074,4.777777777777778
2223283,1,B0007NMJD6,the movie is high lonesome it was in the details as a b&w film but i didn't see that. now if i send it back it will cost me so i am stuck with this copy.too much trouble to send back i have not seen this sort of thing since the days of vhs tape  it was common pratice then but now it's wierd.i did get the color version put out by by vci and it is excellent.so be careful and look at the product details.i would not want you to be had.,1221696000,2,435,3.6774193548387095
8049313,3,B0007NMJD6,"I seldom, maybe never, give a low rating because of picture quality.  But I almost made an exception for this Synergy release of High Lonesome.  A color movie in black and white with a picture so blurred that in some shots I couldn't recognize Jack Elam or tell a horse from a cow.  Really, Really bad.  If I had not streamed this via Amazon Prime, I would be arguing with Amazon about a refund.

Now to the movie itself and SPOILERS AHEAD:  Another reviewer said that this movie is a bit of Hitchcock and Rod Serling.  There are scenes in the movie in which the Smiling Man (Jack Elam) and Roper seem to be ghosts and the movie seems to be in the Twlight Zone, but writer and director Alan LeMay played it straight.  There is a non-supernatural explanation for all that happened.  My opinion is that the movie would have been much better if the studio had gotten some one to finish in a Hitchcock or Serling style.  This was novelist and screen writer Alan LeMay's only directorial outing.  For good reason.  His directing is hit and miss.

John Drew Barrymore has drawn some criticism for his acting in this movie.  True he wasn't a great actor but he is not outrageously bad.  A young Chill Wills is very good as an actor and singer.  I was also impressed with Basel Ruysdael, particularly his voice, as ranch owner Horse Davis.  In his last movie role Ruysdael provided the voice of the truck driver in 101 Dalmatians.",1508544000,,1422,4.470817120622568
