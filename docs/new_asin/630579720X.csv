1073389,5,630579720X,One of the best HORROR movies of the seventies.  If you went to see it at the Drive In Theatre it was always paired with Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I remember as a kid it scared me to the point I never forgot about it and getting to see it once again was awesome.  Still scares me.  A must see for any vintage or current horror fan.,1460851200,,331,3.9696969696969697

1073394,5,630579720X,"This is one of the best giallo films ever made. I know that's a pretty big statement and a lot of people are going to disagree with me (hell, I review dozens of giallo films on this site and I usually love them all), but this film, especially in its original Italian uncut form (which is a mix of English language and Italian/with English subtitles), deals with sexuality and, especially, sexual violence, in such a frank and brutal way, once you watch it (and I mean really WATCH it, not put it on while you are doing something else), you will never forget it. The film opens at a photo-shoot (or rather, a secret photo-shoot), where we see Carol (Cristina Airoldi) and Flo (Patrizia Adiutori) making love to some unknown man as the camera clicks away. An eyeless doll hides one of the girl's private parts, as we see the man striking the doll's hair and sticking his fingers into its empty eye sockets (How's that for symbolism?). We then switch to Italian Professor Franz (John Richardson; FRANKENSTEIN '80 - 1972), who is teaching a class on painter Perugino and his fascination with St. Sebastian, as the camera pans across the students in the class (Cinematographer Giancarlo Ferrando has a way of making all the girls look innocent, while the men and male teens look like they are hiding something or leer like sexual perverts. You'll be seeing a lot of both in this film). After the lecture is over, students Jane (Suzy Kendall; SPASMO - 1974), Daniela (Tina Aumont; LIFESPAN - 1974) and Stefano (Roberto Bisacco; HANDS OF STEEL - 1986) confront Franz on why he was so harsh in his assessment of Perugino's later career. Franz gives a brief explanation and leaves, but to the viewer, we see that both Jane and Franz are interested in each other. Stefano ask Daniela if he can give her a lift home, but she brushes him aside, saying she is going home with Jane. Stefano looks really mad (as do two motorcycle thugs standing next to him) and then, for some reason, seems to follow Flo and her boyfriend John (Fausto De Bella) as they drive off, which Daniela notices. The next time we see Flo and John, they are parked at an abandoned building making out in the car. John then notices someone in a gray ski mask and black leather gloves (a giallo staple) is watching them. He gets out of the car and chases the stranger, but when John doesn't return, Flo gets nervous, turns on the car's headlights and gets out to look for him. The black-gloved stranger reaches into the car and turns off the lights, so Flo returns to a car, only for the stranger to strangle Flo with a red & black patterned scarf, fondle her breasts and then graphically cut open her chest with a knife. As the camera pans back we see John's dead body, his throat slit wide open (a really graphic image, especially for 1973), as the shot expertly turns to daytime with Inspector Martino (Luciano De Ambrosis) and his squad hovering around John's body. He interviews a bum who discovered the body, but gets nowhere with him (The bum tells the Inspector that he was about to take a crap outside, but once he saw John's dead body, he became constipated!). We then see the mysterious Roberto (Luc Merenda; KIDNAP SYNDICATE - 1975) buying the same exact patterned scarf that killed Flo from street vendor Gianni (Ernesto Colli; AUTOPSY - 1975), while he and Gianni leer at the miniskirt-wearing Carol, who once hearing of her friend Flo's death, screams out ""No! No!"" and runs away. Because of Flo's untimely death, classes are closed for the day at the University, so Franz asks Jane if she would like to get a drink with him, which she readily accepts. Franz tells Jane that he is pleasantly surprised that an American could show so much interest in Perugino (you really should Google him) and Jane replies that she doesn't know whether to take that as a compliment or an insult. Franz and Jane hit it off rather nicely and, as this meeting ends, Franz asks her to go to a music concert with him in the near future and she says yes. As Jane is walking to her car, she notices Carol arguing with Daniele's Uncle Nino (Carlo Alighiero; THE CAT O' NINE TAILS - 1971) and hears Nino say that he wants to break-off his relationship with Carol because of the circumstances going on, it could become public knowledge and ruin him. Nino then spots Jane and drives away quickly. Stefano picks up a hooker (Rosaria della Femmina) from the street and they go back to her place. When he is unable to perform, the hooker calls him ""queer"", which seems to set off a trigger where Stefano becomes violent, slapping the hooker and then putting his hands around her neck, but somehow stops himself from strangling her. Carol, who is acting extremely jittery, spots Roberto leering at her (there's a lot of leering going on in this film) through a cafe window, and then blows-off Daniela, instead jumping on the back of a motorcycle of one of the two thugs we saw earlier in the film. We see Carol smoking a joint at the party, while the two motorcycle thugs fondle her breasts, When they try unbuttoning her pants, she pushes their hands away and tells them no. She then leaves the party and ends up in a foggy marsh, with the two thugs jumping on their motorcycles trying to find her (One of them says, ""I'll strangle that b**ch!""), until one falls off his bike and they decide it's not worth the trouble. The ski-masked killer is not so forgiving, though, as he strangles Carol with the same patterned scarf that killed Flo, only this time he graphically pokes her eyes out with his fingers (subliminal frames pop-up showing the fingers going into the doll like we saw in the beginning of the film) before he fondles her breasts and cuts open her chest. Inspector Martino is clueless and appeals to the University students to offer up some clues. Daniele tells Jane that the last time she saw Carol was when she jumped on the back of a motorcycle and maybe she should tell the Inspector. Jane tells her that she has an over-active imagination and since the two motorcycle thugs are also University students, she shouldn't get them in trouble without more concrete proof. Once at home, Daniele gets a threatening phone call (if you look close enough, you can tell who is making the call), telling her to keep her mouth shut or she will get strangled with a red & black scarf. Her Uncle Nino arrives and when Daniele tells him about the phone call, he tells her that she should take a few of her female friends to his country estate for the weekend for some rest and relaxation. Before Daniele and her friends go to the country estate (Jane has something to do and will join them later), Daniele is nearly sexually assaulted by Stefano (who professes his love for her, saying she and him were meant to be together forever), and Gianni the scarf seller, after being interviewed by Inspector Martino, makes a phone call to someone saying that he has to sell his business (it's obviously a blackmail call). The next time we see Gianni, he is stuffing two bundles of cash into his sports-coat, but someone driving a car crushes Gianni's head over and over with the bumper of his car against a stone wall (it's the first time in quite a while that I nearly turned my eyes away because this scene is so graphic and that's quite a compliment!). Now that we have enough red herrings to fill a sardine can, including Uncle Nino, who leers at his nearly naked niece while she is getting a neck rub from Jane, we have to figure out exactly who the killer is. It could be any man still alive at this point, even the country estate's village idiot (Enrico De Marco). Nearly every male holds some deep dark secret, so it won't be easy to spot the real killer (and I'm not going to tell). I will tell you that the last 25 minutes of the film is a white knuckle ride (and nearly dialogue-free), as the late-arriving Jane falls down a flight of stairs and sprains her ankle, so when the killer arrives and murders all the girls in the house, he has no idea Jane is in an upstairs bedroom knocked out with a sleeping pill. When Jane wakes up, she watches horrified as the killer (we still don't know who it is, but some of the suspects have been murdered or are revealed as nice guys) cuts up her friends into pieces with a tree branch saw (really graphic) and stuffs their body parts in a burlap sack so he can bury them outside. Will Jane survive or succumb to the killer? I've given you all the clues to figure it out, so it is up to you to discover the answer to that question.  Brilliantly directed and co-written (with Ernesto Gastaldi; ALMOST HUMAN - 1974) by Sergio Martino (YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM... - 1972; SCREAMERS - 1979; THE GREAT ALLIGATOR - 1979; AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK - 1983; and many others), who was not afraid to make a film like this, especially at a time when sexual violence was frowned upon and was usually relegated to porn films. While there is plenty of beautiful full frontal nudity, including lesbian lovemaking, nude sunbathing and naked swims in the country estate's lake, much of the nudity is used for opposite effect, showing how some women use their sexuality to get what they want. Only in this film, they pay for such sins with their lives and Martino doesn't pull away when the violence happens. Those who saw this film in U.S. theaters in the R-Rated version are in for a treat, as the widescreen Blue Underground Blu-Ray offers us two versions of the film: The 90 minute unedited English cut and the 93 minute Italian cut, which is the preferable way of watching it. Most of the Italian version is in English, but what isn't is in Italian with English subtitles. The copious nudity and graphic violence is really an eye-opener, much of it missing from the U.S. theatrical version and all VHS tapes. The Italian cut offers the film with its original Italian title, ""I Corpi Presentano Tracce Di Violenza Carnale"", which translates to ""The Body Shows Traces Of Carnal Violence"". It's a much better title than the well-known English one because it conveys exactly what you are about to see when you put your Blu-Ray into the player. The killings are unflinching and very graphic for the time. It blows away anything you see in FRIDAY THE 13TH, made seven years later, out of the water. The killer's motivation has to do with the way he sees women. As a child, he saw his younger brother fall off a cliff and die while trying to retrieve a female friend's doll, so he equates women with dolls and death, cutting their limbs off as easy as pulling the legs and arms off a doll (and poking their eyes out, too!). There are also some great POV shots and beautiful sweeping photography (pay attention to the scene where Jane leaves Franz after having a drink with him and then going to her car and try not to be impressed). The last 25 minutes will have you gripping your chair until your knuckles are white, as Jane tries to find a way to alert the town below that she is in trouble (First using a mirror in the sun to try and get someone's attention from her bedroom window, but it doesn't work). There a scene where Jane tries to retrieve the key from the other side of the locked door (using the old ""newspaper slid under the door while she pokes the key with a hairpin to make it drop on the newspaper"" trick) that will have you s***ting your pants when you think she has failed, but it has only alerted the killer that she is in the house and he puts the key on the newspaper. If you want a good, old-fashioned murder mystery, look somewhere else. But if you want a take-no-mercy, nudity-filled, graphic and brutal look at a sexual deviate on a killing spree, you can do no better than TORSO (also released in some countries under the title CARNAL VIOLENCE). Believe me, it's that good (be on the lookout for gratuitous shots of J&B Scotch bottles, another staple in Italian films). Also starring Angelo Covello, Carla Brait, Vincent Crocitti, and Luciano Bartoli & Gianno Greco as the motorcycle thugs. Originally released in a severely cut fullscreen print on VHS from Prism Entertainment, with a nearly uncut print on DVD from Anchor Bay years later. The Blu-Ray from Blue Underground is the most complete you are ever going to see it and it looks nearly flawless, to boot. If you want to watch it the way it was meant to be seen, this Blu-Ray is your only real choice. A Blue Underground Blu-Ray Release. Originally Rated R, but this uncut version is Not Rated and rightfully so.",1437782400,4,12468,4.526595744680851

1073500,4,630579720X,"Supposedly, this is a forerunner in the slasher genre.  Considering it involves a killer who prefers to strangle his victims............  At any rate, bodies are involved.  There's nudity throughout gratuitous and otherwise.  The story evolves over many days, shown in brief snippets, day/night/day/night, regular as clockwork and just as irritating.  There are a lot of senseless scenes, characters introduced then dismissed, guys who scowl or squint at women in a decidedly unfriendly manner.  Bursts of conversation tedious and dull.  Not a few angry invectives are shouted indiscriminately: ""I'll strangle the bitch!""  ""I'll kill you bitch, I'll kill you!""  All of which eventually leads up to four woman taking refuge (or a holiday of sorts) in an isolated villa high on a cliff.  Naturally, the killer follows them and does just what you would expect.

I wouldn't consider this movie to be particularly inventive, it's a plot that's been used to death.  The so-called `mystery' of who the killer is doesn't shock, it also doesn't make much sense, considering the reasoning behind the murders.  Like a lot of mysteries, the `clues' can't be pieced together in such a way as to figure out who's doing what and why.  You have to wait for the reveal.  Needless to say, the story involves sex, violence, several blackmailers, and a guy who hates women.  And a creepy eyeless doll.

I liked it well enough to keep it for future viewings but it's hardly a masterpiece of the genre.",1410566400,,1480,5.0

1073625,4,630579720X,"The film oozes with psycho-sexual tension. Voyeurism plays a strong role in the film. At face value, the film shows Italian males all to be dangerous and crazed sexual predators. The cinematography is excellent. You really see a lot of shots that are still used today in the horror genre. It looks like the French film, High Tension borrowed a lot from this film, and for good reason. Even the film is dated, the suspense is still there when watching the home invasion scene. There is one part where the female protagonist, (who is injured) can do nothing but hide in the closet, as she watches the killer take a hacksaw to his victims. The film makes every male character seem like some sort of sexual deviant because it wants you to keep guessing who the killer is. The problem, for me at least, is that it's painfully obvious.

1073627,5,630579720X,"Anyone familiar with Sergio Martino's filmography knows that Torso is the film many cite not only as his most recognized achievment, but a bridge to the rest of his catalogue. It was a constant on the shelves of the VHS rental stores I frequented in my youth. I snapped it up on impulse early on and rented it at least once more, decades ago. I knew nothing of Martino or his other work, but I could tell a well excecuted film when I saw it. It stayed with me, in my head's back catologue. Years later, Blue Underground gave it the treatment it deserved and I picked it up. Never reading up on the history of Italian cinema, I expanded upon my love of Fulci's City of the Living Dead prior to this and began picking up not only Lucio's works, but things that remained in my mental rolodex of what I consider above the bar. This release I want to thank Bill Lustig for. Picking it up a bit ago, I realized that it stood on even ground with anything I had recently ingested from Fulci, Bava and Argento. The film work and coloring is presented as it was in theaters, maybe better. That alone would captivate me. Usually enough to keep the interest of any fan of the genre. What really struck me as strongly now, was the story, the killer, the  remarkably beautiful women and the obvious influence it had on the american slasher genre that hit it's golden age in the late 70s. Also the fact that this is better than all those nascent U.S. films circa 79-82 technically and in it's ability to allow me to suspend my disbelief and just enjoy the film. All this has made me dig deeper into his catalogue and reaffirm everything I love about his directional style and the film it produced. Looking back on Torso now that I have reference, I can see that this is the product of a man gifted with revealing and realising his passion to the world. Maybe the guy was a little over reactive for his emasculated youth memories, maybe the story could be seen as a bit thin and maybe I am a bit biased since I love these type of films. All these maybes have not detracted from the enjoyment I get revisiting this film and allowing me to be taken into his vision. High fallutin prose, I know. But if you like GOOD horror you can't go wrong. Light on the gore by today's standards, but emminently engrossing as a product of it's times. These times, too. Little competition from today's formulatic approaches and CAGs. Taken for what it is, it is hard not to appreciate this film. If you do like it, dip back into his catalogue. It only gets better and more outrageous. If you are an armchair critic prejudiced by Hollywood/ US Cinema, don't waste your time looking for another scapegoat to defend Jason or his mom. This is not your's to behold. If you know what a good thing is when you see it, dive in.",1389139200,5,2786,4.357692307692307

Yes violent is definitely the word, because this packs it on like hamburger joints pack in salad.... Tons! Slashings, stabbings, eye poking, strangulation, drowning, etc, etc, etc...

Don't listen to people whine about the only uncut version being Italian. I can assure you that once this Slasher starts playing, you won't care one bit.

1073722,4,630579720X,"Sergio Martino takes a...ahem...stab at a giallo flick.  And why not?  Like most Italian directors, he's directed films in practically every genre anyway.  It's not his only genre offering, but probably his best, and definitely his most well known.
A string of murders occurs on a college campus by a masked killer, and a group of female art students decide to escape the madness by taking off to a remote villa.  Guess who follows?
The Italians really had this slasher thing down well before Friday the 13th came along.  The murders are bloody and violent(for the time it was rather extreme, but not so much now for the typical horror fan), and there is a great deal of female flesh on display, including a lesbian scene!  Whoopee!!  Of course, this makes it easy to predict who will get slaughtered by the killer, as pretty much all the victims are shown nude at some point except Kendall, who naturally doesn't appear nude.  The killer's identity is rather easy to figure out, but it's all about the journey, not the destination, right?  In the giallo tradition, there is a heavy attempt to make a particular character seem the most likely candidate for the killer, but it's so obvious that he isn't the killer because of how disturbed and messed up they make him.  And the fact that all the evidence points to him too!  The last act with Kendall and the killer playing a game of cat and mouse in the villa is actually rather suspenseful at times.  Like many giallos, it's stylish, and looks great.
The film's title more than likely refers to the fact that the killer likes to cop a feel on his victims after he murders them.  Tasteful.

I have been a fan of this classic since seeing it at the drive in during the mid '70s, now to own a copy of this movie that looks the best it has ever looked! Blue Underground just keeps releasing some good (and some bad) blu rays. It is hard to believe a film from 1973 could look this good. Glad I took the risk, because this blows away the DVD BU released several years ago. You have the option to watch either the English 90 minute version or the Italian 93 minute version. And the greatest part is you can choose English audio for the Italian cut!! That is so cool. Although some of it is spoken only in Italian, but not much.
The film is presented in its original 1.66 aspect ratio (where most prints have over matted the prints). Just glad a company took the time and money to make this classic look this great. This is a great looking blu ray of this forgotten Italian classic.

Both are indeed uncensored, but there are slight differences in the disks. The most recent version (yellow box, and less expensive) is missing a few brief scenes, none critical, that appear on the older (red box) one. Because the scenes are not important, and have apparently suffered the permanent loss of their English soundtracks (the Italian soundtrack is still there), they were probably deleted for the reissue, although the cuts do remove another brief bit of slasher fondling victim. I thought the yellow version looked crisper, with brighter color, perhaps benefiting from work done for the Blu-ray transfer. Given a choice, I would take the yellow version, but not pay extra for Blu-ray. The movie is a product of its time and place, and, by Hollywood standards of the day, crudely made with weak acting. It nonetheless has sufficient clever moments and, at the end, genuine suspense, to warrant its reputation. The first half looks more like a nudie film which, together with the graphic violence, made it much more provocative than contemporary mainstream American films (though not for long), and probably accounts for the censorship to which it was long subjected.

There are two versions of the film, a U.S. dubbed cut which is 90 mins, and the original Italian cut which is 93 and contains nice clear yellow subtitles.

There's also an introduction by Eli Roth who claims it's one of the best Gialli, and an interview with the director which is 11 mins, some trailers, T.V. spots, all in Hi-Def, not a huge amount but enough (it's not exactly The Godfather!)

There's lots of potential suspects and dead people along the way.  One death scene is almost painfully bad in execution as a rubber head gets crushed between a car and a wall (you can literally see the fake head cave), then in the next shot the guy's head is intact as he stumbles, not quite dead.  Yet cinematography overall is gorgeous, largely thanks to the locations, and overall direction is solid.  The whole thing clocks in at 90 or 93 minutes depending on if you choose the US or Italian version to watch, so it doesn't overstay its welcome either.

I've always been impressed with Blue Underground's ability to produce clean clear transfers of the sometimes obscure movies they release, and this one's no exception.

Pretty standard z-grade giallo in that it completely abandons any pretension at coherence and sits around coming up with inventive ways to kill people. Of course, there are directors who do this sort of thing wonderfully, but I'm still not convinced that Sergio Martino is one of them.

In this case, it seems that a crazed killer is targeting art students at a prestigious Italian university. One student's father counsels her to get out of town and head for his country villa (conveniently located in the middle of nowhere) and take as many friends with her as she wants to. Setting up, of course, the classic, and somewhat boring, secluded-house-stalked-by-killer scenario. That said, while the ending is predictable (by Roger Ebert's rule of thumb in bad slasher films that the guy you least expect is inevitably the killer), Martino does take a few liberties with the time-tested formula, and so this isn't quite as bad a film as it could have been (and as many now-forgotten giallos are), but it's still trite and full of clich&eacute;.

Yes violent is definitely the word, because this packs it on like hamburger joints pack in salad.... Tons! Slashings, stabbings, eye poking, strangulation, drowning, etc, etc, etc...

Don't listen to people whine about the only uncut version being Italian. I can assure you that once this Slasher starts playing, you won't care one bit.

Anchor Bay, in the early days of DVD, were, perhaps one of the best companies releasing cult titles as they were usually of high quality remastering and the best versions available at the time (many times the first time available in any home video format). Needless to say, Torso certainly falls in that category as they release an uncut version for the first time to US audiences. Some of the scenes are in its original Italian because some of the original English soundtrack was lost. But you do have the option of watching with original Italian language with subtitles, or dubbed in English. Both work equally well. It is presented in Widescreen and the image looks clean.

Directed by Sergio Martino tells the story of a killer of sexy coeds in Rome by using a red and black scarf that everyone is now suspicious of anyone who owns one. In the meantime, Tina Aumont and Suzy Kendall, along with other women, show off enough skin to let the audience forget about the killer, at least for a time.

The plot is not deep or thickly involving, but does have its moment of curiosity. There are some scenes of excellent tension towards the end, but it is a little slow getting there, despite some of the gruesome killings. On the other hand, the killings are also never overdone as to be a bloodbath for the sake of gore, but plays within the means of the story. Of the giallo's, TORSO remains one of the classics of its genre.

According to dvdcompare.com, the Anchor Bay version has 1 scene cut from it, but no censor cuts. This is not the Us released version which originally cut out scenes for its violence and gore.

1074006,5,630579720X,"""Torso"" is to Sergio Martino what ""Deep Red"" is to Dario Argento.  It is a wonderful slash-and-stalk giallo with a delightfully high body count.  Numerous American movies during the slasher frenzy era, especially ""Friday the 13th,"" were influenced by this Italian giallo.  Instead of a hockey mask, the serial killer wears a ski mask.  Also, some of the musical score for ""Torso"" reminded me of that found in ""Halloween.""  ""Prom Night"" was similar to ""Torso"" in that both movies involved a killer who had suffered a traumatic experience as a child.

  Suzy Kendall (star of Dario Argento's ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"") is June, the blonde, virginal heroine in ""Torso.""  She, like so many beautiful blondes in the slash-and-stalk thrillers of the slasher frenzy, is the last to survive the killer's fury.  At a secluded villa, she awakes to discover the mutilated bodies of her friends.

  The killings throughout ""Torso"" are imaginative and gruesome.  However, they lack the realism found in Lucio Fulci's gialli such as ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" and ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin.""

  Sergio Martino directed ""Torso"" as well as other famous gialli such as ""Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key"" and ""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail.""  It is understandable why he said that ""Torso"" was his favorite film in the seventies.  He must have been constantly surrounded by beautiful, naked women.  ""Torso"" has a stronger sexual content then most of his other gialli.  However, the nude scenes are essential to the plot.  They are also understandable considering the ""sexual awakening"" of the seventies  Naturally, the movie also has plenty of drug use, promiscuity, and lesbianism, as much as there was in other gialli of that time period.  European directors must've loved watching beautiful women kissing each other.  Those crazy seventies.

  The plot, characterization, acting, scenery, and musical score are superb.  ""Torso"" is a great giallo and I highly recommend that you buy if for your giallo collection.  The out of print Anchor Bay edition is very expensive, but there is a more affordable import.  However, I've read that the audio and video are of higher quality from Anchor Bay.

[I Corpi Presentano Tracce di Violenza Carnale]

(Italy - 1973)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Following the murder of several classmates by a frenzied sex-killer, a group of female students retire to an isolated villa until police have apprehended a viable suspect. But the maniac is wise to their deception, and he/she follows them...

This stylish, gripping giallo-thriller - the equal of anything directed by Dario Argento at the time - was co-written by veteran scribe Ernesto Gastaldi and director Sergio Martino, the latter a journeyman technician whose commercial ethos catapulted him from one genre to another within the dictates of Italian popular cinema (cf. BLADE OF THE RIPPER, THE VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS, SEX WITH A SMILE, etc.). Despite bland performances from an unremarkable cast (including Euro stalwarts Suzy Kendall [THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE], John Richardson [THE MASK OF SATAN] and Luc Merenda [THEY CALLED HIM AMEN]), and some pretty obvious red herrings amongst the supporting players, TORSO is augmented by a number of beautifully crafted set-pieces (most notably the stalking of a young woman [Cristina Airoldi] through desolate marshland by the masked maniac), photographed with stunning visual flair by Martino's regular DP Giancarlo Ferrando (THE CASE OF THE SCORPION'S TAIL) and edited to perfection by Eugenio Alabiso (MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD).

The second half of the movie, during which Kendall becomes enmeshed in a nightmarish situation at a remote but picturesque country villa, is genuinely nerve-racking, staged with cat-and-mouse efficiency by Martino at his most inspired. Spiced with audience-pleasing elements of sex and violence which tested the limits of censorship in 1973, TORSO is a minor gem. Produced by Carlo Ponti, previously responsible for the likes of WAR AND PEACE (1956) and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO!",1077580800,17,1885,5.508650519031142

Director and co-screenplay writer Sergio Martino develops a loosely interesting mystery through the films course. However, after the first half-hour everything about Torso becomes tediously redundant and stale, and the murder scenes do not succeed in creating any horrific element at all (one scene, where the killer is chasing a witness through the city streets, is actually very effective, though). Redeeming the film somewhat, Torso does have some terrific performances and cinematography coutesy of veteran Giancarlo Ferrando.
Aside from the film, this Anchor Bay release lacks extras aside from two trailers.

After reading them both, she said Torso, and by gosh,  she was right on target.  This is an awesome giallo that has one of the  coolest murder scenes I've ever seen; it takes place in the woods, and the  poor girl really gets it good.  First, she looks up and sees a figure  obscured by the mist, but she's stoned so she kinda just stands there  dumbly.  Then all of a sudden, he's right in front of her, and let's just  say he's not taking an evening stroll.  The plot has something to do with a  killer who's haunted by some weird childhood memeory involving a doll, and  he goes around killing college girls and sawing them into little bits....  Though the film  is sometimes dated and sometimes stupid, it is enormously entertaining.  There's enough gore to keep everybody interested, and lots of sex and  lesbians making out (if you like that sort of thing).  I think this is a  very capable giallo that should be checked out by eveybody who likes this  stuff;you won't be disappointed.",961200000,6,1520,4.468864468864469
1074125,5,630579720X,"This is a better than average Italian horror flick that most likely influenced films such as ""Friday the 13th"" & ""Halloween"".  The scene with the girl lost in the woods is  excellent.  The trees are spinning around her and then suddenly...well I  won't tell you, but the scene is just wonderfully shot.  There is lots of  sex and nudity involved (being that the killer IS a psychosexual) but the  gore isn't as heavy as suggested with a title like ""Torso"".  It  kind of reminds me of a foreign ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".  The  DVD itself is pretty good.  Not PACKED with extras, but still visually  marvelous.  I was hesitant to buy this film, but I'm glad I did.  This is a  MUST HAVE for any true horror fans collection!",961027200,8,722,4.5234375
1074126,3,630579720X,"I originally saw this giallo about 5 years ago in a terrible censored and pan and scanned video. Thought the film was awful.  The quality of this DVD is magnificent and greatly improves the film - it can now be seen in all  its original stylish, suspenseful and misogynistic glory.  The ski-masked,  knife wielding killer must have inspired the Halloween series.  Director  Sergio Martino's use of colour is awesome in the two early murder scenes.  The last half hour, with Suzy Kendall alone in the house with the killer  (not having taken her clothes off, she is the only woman allowed to  survive), having to watch her friends being dismembered is really tense and  exciting.",957225600,,678,4.817391304347826
1074127,5,630579720X,"Anchor Bay's DVD of TORSO is incredible - the image is crisp, sharp, colorful and there is no artifacting whatsoever.  The print is also UNCUT!  For years the film was seen in the US only in an edited version  with most of the gore and sex cut out.  It's great to finally see the  entire uncut film with it's original opening and the extra sex and gore  bits....I love the head crushing scene (albeit kind of fake) plus there's  extra shots of the killer sawing up the bodies into little pieces.  What  more do you want?  There's the cool looking hooded killer plus lots of  stylistic giallo touches...this movie is better than ever especially in  this impeccable presentation.  It's letterboxed and includes the fun US  trailer-""Tor---so!"" as well as the original euro-trailer.  A few  shots in the film are in italian with english-subtitles because either the  english track was never recorded or it had been lost...but it's not  annoying at all and you just can't help loving this disc...especially if  you are into euro-sleaze!  One of Anchor Bay's best!",954892800,51,1058,4.804469273743017

7894924,4,630579720X,"A group of girls are targeted by a masked killer at an Italian college and go to a local villa to get away from him. Torso is an Italian giallo film that focuses on eroticism and slasher kills. The characters are pretty frivolous and basically interchangeable. All of the women are kind of vapid and idiotic. The film very often focuses on their beauty, their nonchalant sexuality, or their over the top sexuality. I couldn't name any of them individually except for Jane, the unlikely final girl. The men are all vaguely or overtly threatening. Any one of them could be the murderer or at the very least rape one of the women. They definitely objectify these women, either stalking them and staring with intensity or literally chasing them down with motorcycles threatening to kill them. Believe it or not, the latter isn't even the real murderer. The gender portrayals are unflattering on all sides, but the film has some merits.

The real success of the film is the last section. After a predictably sapphic couple of days in the idyllic countryside, Jane wakes up from her upstairs room to all of her friends dead. Giallo and slasher films typically show these kills in extreme closeup with focus on the women's bodies and whatever mutilation is being done. This scene is uncharacteristically restrained. In the scene previous, the audience knows the murders are going to happen, but we only see the aftermath. We are put in the same situation as Jane, confused about what happened and struggling to put the pieces together. The killer had no idea Jane was even there because she didn't travel with the others. When the killer steps out, she desperately tries using the phone and escaping the house, but he's cut off every means of communication or escape. Even through her shock and horror, she decides to cover any trace of herself in the house, but of course she makes a fatal mistake. The best scenes of the film are when she is hiding in the house after finding her dead friends, struggling not to make any noise while the killer goes about disposing of their bodies in the most gruesome way. Torso is not the best slasher or giallo film. However, it breaks conventions, making the ending extremely effective.",1490054400,,2218,4.761038961038961

The nude scenes are okay, but none of them involve Tina Aumont (who has nothing to do in this film) and Suzy Kendall (who spends the last third of the film hiding in a chateau while the killer works his deeds below). The revealed motivation for the killer is ridiculous and unconvincing, as if they had just tacked it on at the last moment.",1466553600,3,447,4.209302325581396
