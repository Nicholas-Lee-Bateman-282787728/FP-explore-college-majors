8652431,3,B00JMF4SCA,"La Wally appeared at an interesting stage The Late Romantic Era was fading, and Verismo was emerging. La Wally shows evidence of both, There are overheated, exaggerated emotions;  and fairly ordinary squabbles erupt into high drama. As is typical of Verismo, the singing rates second to the drama.  The ageing voice of the lead soprano performs badly under pressure in her one decent aria, 'Ebben?... Ne andro lontana'. The leading man has cruelly high tenor tessitura throughout, apparently his way of expressing deep feeling. The orchestra is big and noisy, with the percussion manufacturing drama. This at least comes in handy for the avalanche. The scenery is poorly done Too often one wonders: Where are we? What's that thing supposed to be?Actually, the plunges over the cliff, supposedly making this opera too difficult for a provincial opera house, are quite believably handled.",1476316800,2,886,5.232394366197183
8652432,2,B00JMF4SCA,"I wanted to see this opera, so I bought this DVD, which is the only one I could find.  It was interesting to watch it as performed by a Tirolean opera company in Innsbruck.  All the singers seemed too old for their parts, except for the excellent female singer in the boy role.",1456963200,,277,4.2075471698113205
8652433,4,B00JMF4SCA,"La Wally is a verismo work that is hardly ever performed unless a great diva (Renata Tebaldi) wants to do it.  It has one famous aria for soprano which the film Diva popularized.  The rest is melodrama.  Since it has an alpine setting, it is a natural for the Innsbruck Opera House to do it.  The singers there are all ""house"" artists--they're not on the international circuit.  But as provincial productions go, this is a winner.  The singers have the overstuffed look of a different era, but they throw themselves into the work with energy, conviction, and good musicianship. I've heard far worse performances in small opera houses in Como and Bergamo.  Hence, I would recommend this release for anyone with an interest in verismo or for ""completists"" who want DVDs of operas they're unlikely to see in live performance.",1433203200,4,822,4.828571428571428
8652434,3,B00JMF4SCA,Nice to see this opera at last. Well sung and directed.,1427587200,,55,4.090909090909091
8652435,1,B00JMF4SCA,"Imaginative production of the ""singing glacier"". Music a bore. Is there hope for Dallas's ""Everest""paired with Act 4 of Wally?",1418515200,,126,5.35
8652436,4,B00JMF4SCA,"This one was quite a surprise.  Good staging and costuming, and solid vocal performances by Von der Burg, Langbein.. and Ferreira.  The libretto?  Well, not so strong, but the music sizzles.  And, how many times do you get to listen the Tiroler SymphonieOrchester from Innsbruck?. I welcome this (only) recording of La Wally.  It fills  a niche in my collection of Verismo.",1414195200,5,373,4.935483870967742
8652437,3,B00JMF4SCA,"I've known and enjoyed Wally's aria for years, but had never seen the whole opera, and I'm unaware of any other production of La Wally on DVD, so I was really looking forward to finally seeing this. It was a mixed bag.
I enjoyed it visually. The costumes were traditional. The set was modern and minimal and moved in elaborate ways with lifts and turntables and whatnot. It went fine with the costumes.  I'm not sure why there were abominable snowmen periodically walking around, but whatever.
You know those emails you get from someone in Africa or the Philippines? The ones when they ask for your banking information because they need to wire you $250,000? I'm pretty sure the author of those emails did the subtitles for this, ie ""me have to live my live"" and such. It wasn't like that throughout, but there were definitely times I was painfully aware that whoever wrote the English translations hadn't quite mastered the language and does not ""belief"" in proof reading. Pretty distracting.
The video is pixelated at times. Granted, I got the DVD and not the blu ray, but a DVD is normally much clearer. It was like watching something someone had burned to a disc from YouTube. But again, this was inconsistent.
The performances were good for the most part. Lukewarm attempts at acting, some more interested than others in playing their characters in addition to singing the music. Nothing unusual there, I suppose. And if opera is all about the music to you, that's not an issue. I thought Susanne Langbein in the trouser role was the real stand out, engaged in her role vocally AND dramatically. Susanna Von der Burg has a voice well-suited to the character and her delivery of her aria was good.  Paulo Ferreira sounded terrific as Hagenbach, but as an actor, he phoned in his performance.
Anyway, that's my opinion and I'm sure some will respectfully disagree. But I hope I was able to help you decide whether to purchase this item, which is my intention.",1412553600,22,1962,4.733918128654971
