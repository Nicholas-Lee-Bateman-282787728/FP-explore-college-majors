1884806,4,B00009MEIY,"Except for the cheesy music and picture quality, this is by far, the best yoga video I have ever done.  Not recommend at all for beginners.  Baron takes you through a very fast paced routine starting with Sun Salutations, both A and B series.  After that you move into a lot of various stretching poses.  Unlike other yoga videos I've done, there are no modified poses for different levels.  If you want a challenging workout.. buy this video!",1074038400,8,443,4.628205128205129
1884807,4,B00009MEIY,"I liked the workout.  The DVD is not packed with special features or an aesthetically pleasing set (if you want that, check out Power Yoga with Rodney Yee), but I got a great workout that left me centered but also made me sweat.
More importantly, even though I've used several yoga dvds before (Rodney Yee, Crunch Yoga (one of my all-time favorites), Bender Birch (difficult, I've only tried it once)), I actually felt like I was learning a new approach to the practice.  The moves, taken by themselves, are not new.  But his cueing and instruction flow and make me think about emphasizing different techniques as I go through the standard sun salutation poses.
Worth a try!",1068163200,17,674,4.743589743589744
1884808,5,B00009MEIY,"I found this to be one of the best beginner/intermediate ashtanga workouts that I've seen.  This DVD cuts right to chase, no special features tabs, about the teacher tabs, etc.  There is a brief introduction by the Baron, and then he gets right into it. Baron and his class (composed of 4 women and two men of various skill levels) stay pretty true to the warmup and standing poses section of the primary series (Sun Salutations A & B, forward bends, balance pose, etc.).  The only adjustment is the half bound lotus forward bend is modified so that you can either grab the foot and hold it to the inside of opposite thigh without having to ""bind"" the foot and bend forward, or do tree pose if that's too difficult.  Baron then gets into the floor exercises, he pretty much performs the beginner and few intermediate level floor poses (eastern plank, one-legged forward bends A and B, Marichyasana A, etc.).  The more advanced poses are left out (i.e. tortise, sleeping tortise, rooster, headstands, etc.).  He then goes into a modified closing sequence, and ends the class with the corpse pose.  Overall, I think this DVD is a great intro to ashtanga yoga.  It makes the Primary Series accessible to either yoga newbies or beginner/intermediate level students who are trying to ease there way into ashtanga yoga.  This tape is a great building block towards completing the Primary Series.  This DVD could also be used (along w/ attending regualr classes) as a stepping stone towards more advanced DVDs like Richard Freeman's Primary Series DVD which teaches the entire Primary Series with no modifications, see my review for details (not for the faint of heart ;-)).  Overall I enjoyed this DVD and would suggest it to anyone looking to start learning the Primary Series without being intimidated by the some of the poses it includes.  The advanced practicioner of the Primary Series however, would be grow bored easily.",1067212800,32,1921,4.858895705521473
1884809,5,B00009MEIY,"This is the third tape in the three-part Baptiste ""Power Yoga"" series.  It is essentially the Ashtanga Yoga First Series split in half to make a 45-minute session, which makes the tape sort of like David Swenson's Short Forms tape.  I like Baron quite well, and this is a nice chance for more fitness-oriented Yoga practitioners to explore more advanced elements of Yoga like breathing technique, abdominal locks and gazing points.  It is also, of course, a great workout, although it focuses a bit more on the poses and less on vinyasa or movement flow.  Never fear, though, you will definitely breathe deeply and sweat.",1062633600,8,621,4.885714285714286

7991575,5,B00009MEIY,"I have all three of the power yoga series dvd's. My 1st introduction to yoga was level 1 ""the initial challenge"". in the beginning, not being used to the sun salutation, and standing poses sequence, I would get fatigued. I was always able to finish though. Level one was a nice way to prep for the next level. The flow, pace, and length of the routine is a nice change that gives me a challenge. I love the level of fitness I have attained through yoga practice. I consider my self to be athletic and in better than average shape, playing sports, running, biking, and weight training. Yoga practice has enhanced the quality of everything else I do. I feel more sharp at work, and in dealing with others. My posture has improved greatly. Learning to synchronize breath with the movements, gaining strength, and endurance while holding poses, and postures. Learning to be in control of the flow, through mind, and body is a challenge in every practice. I'm not interested in taking an actual class (at this time), because I like the comfort, and concentration I get being at home. This is a dvd I would recommend only after practicing yoga for a long enough time that your ready to take a new step. I also, would recommend Rodney Yee's videos as well. Between him and Baron, I have two master teachers at my finger tips. They both have there own style and flow, that make for challenging, yet fun workouts. I will be doing yoga until the day I die.",1429574400,,1446,4.522900763358779
7991576,5,B00009MEIY,"This video compliments Power Yoga 2 and Long & Lean Yoga. I have been a fan of Barron Baptiste for over ten years and highly recommend these yoga workouts for both strength and flexibility training. I am in my mid 50's, I practice yoga 2 - 3 times a week and run 2 - 3 times a week and feel I am in the best shape of my life! I watch what I eat, however, I feel the workouts are what really keep my body toned.",1404777600,,410,3.7790697674418605
7991577,2,B00009MEIY,"I thought I was buying a level three challenging work out. However, Baron says on the DVD that this is a beginner's class. It certainly wan't challenging for someone looking for more advanced yoga. I didn't realize that this was an ashtanga yoga disc. I much prefer the flowing vinyassa style.

I found his style of speaking to be a bit harsh - not very spiritual or inspirational. The positioning of the yogi's wasn't really good- they were all facing one another in a line and it didn't allow very good camera angles.",1327536000,2,519,4.580645161290323
7991578,4,B00009MEIY,"Baron Baptiste is one of the inspiring, authentic master yoga teachers of our time. His level III power yoga routine follows the Asthanga primary series. Baron is the yoga teacher that taught me how to take my own yoga practice to the next level. His level III DVD took it even further.

7991579,5,B00009MEIY,I enjoy this video. It's not crazy difficult but not at a beginner level either. It's perfect for me on days I want to work on my practise but don't want a really quick paced Power workout. If you want a quicker paced video try Rodney Yee's Total Body Power Yoga (not for beginners at all). I am excited to have this video as part of my collection.,1232150400,,348,4.132352941176471
7991580,3,B00009MEIY,"I purchased Power Yoga 3 thinking it will be the hardest work out but yet it is for beginners (level 1), I don't know why it calls 3 then. It is a good program but after doing it two times I got so annoyed by the music Baptiste chose (it is a version of a modern dance music) that I can not continue with it anymore. There is no option on DVD to turn the music off. Although, music should sound in the background, during this practice it is a main thing and it is very loud. I don't know what makes experienced yoga instructors to turn away from the yoga classic music. Besides a good work out yoga is a relaxation time. Krshna music is a good combination to yoga practice. I am giving up on Baptiste's DVDs. By some reason, it is always too much of something. My all time favorite is Bryan Kest Yoga. One DVD comes with 3 different work outs (not 1 as the rest do), so it is a much better value for the great exercise.",1182816000,2,919,4.054945054945055
7991581,4,B00009MEIY,"The good thing about this tape is that it does make you sweat and it also gives you  a renewed and energetic feeling afterwards..Baron had condensed the Ashtanga series into a 40 minute practice,which is ideal for those who don't have an hour and a half to invest..I like the fact that Baron seems very sincere,and I would recommend it to those new or fairly new to yoga practice and  also  for those pressed for time..A good tape..",1075680000,6,432,4.512820512820513
