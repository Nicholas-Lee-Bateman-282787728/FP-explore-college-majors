8162260,3,B000LMM09Q,"For fans simply looking for a collection of matches - and no extras - the five-match set featuring Kane may be the way to go.

Taken from 1998-2005, there are three bouts from Unforgiven - 1998 w/ Undertaker, 2003 w/ Shane McMahon, 2004 w/ Shawn Michaels - and one each from SummerSlam (2004 w/ Matt Hardy) and Vengeance (2005 w/ Edge). The latter pair are with a then major storyline surrounding Lita. The highlight is the Inferno Match versus the Undertaker, which can be appreciated without knowing the back story of the ""half-brothers.""

Like a quality house show, the emphasis is on the work-rate inside the ring, minus the nonsense of the soap opera drama.",1229990400,,662,4.747826086956522

Inferno Match vs. Undertaker - For those who've never seen this type of match (currently, there have only been 4 of these types of matches), the ringside is surrounded by fire with the only way to win being to set your opponent on fire.  With the fire being around the ring & occasionally shooting up as high as the top rope, both men were very limited in what they were able to do during the match but still dished out physical punishment towards each other from trading strikes & chokeslams & even a double big boot at one time along while also taking big risk near the fire like Taker's ""old school"" & a top rope superplex.  Kane was able to be tossed over the flames to the outside before meeting up with someone who also wanted his revenge on Kane followed by Taker himself flying over the flames to not only meet Kane on the outside but also finally get his hands on Paul Bearer.  This match was a first of it's kind & knowing the limitations surrounding the match which they were able to surpass, this still stands the test of time to this day.

[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane; Armageddon '06]

Last Man Standing Match vs. Shane McMahon - Shane was out for revenge for Kane giving a tombstone piledriver to his mom on the stage weeks earlier to the point where Shane attacked Kane from behind during his entrance with multiple chairshots to the head & legs before sending Kane into the steps but Kane responded by shoving Shane so hard that he fell into the crowd & caught him coming off the barricade with a powerslam as he dominated Shane using the steps & knocking out the referee in the process.  Shane kept coming at Kane using the steps in the ring as both men then started brawling down the isleway with Shane being thrown into the stage multiple times before Kane tried to crush the spanish announce table on top of him with Shane coming back ""lowering the boom"" on table & even attempting to sacrifice himself to make sure Kane stood down.  This was a physical match with Kane still being an unstoppable monster while Shane just wouldn't give up & brought the fight.

[Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane]

vs. Matt Hardy - This match revolved around another one of those storylines in Kane's career that you wish you could forget about where Kane made a deal with Lita that he'll stop attacking Matt Hardy if Lita had sex with him which lead to Lita becoming pregnant with Kane's child resulting in this ""Till Death Do Us Part"" match where Lita would marry the winner.  Matt tried to hit & move and go for fast covers before Kane caught him with strikes & a drilling clothesline but Matt kept coming with high risk offense like a over the top crossbody & Twist Of Fate on the floor while Kane was able to take advantage of the one high risk opportunity Matt had.  The reality of the situation was that Matt Hardy came into the match injured so it was kept short & served it's purpose.
SummerSlam '04
[Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane]

No Disqualification Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Shawn was given the opportunity for revenge against Kane, thanks to Lita, for putting him out of action for months which Shawn started out in control with Kane being able to catch him with power moves in the corner only for Shawn to keep coming causing Kane to sacrifice his pregnant wife in order to target Shawn's throat using uppercuts & twisting head vice while also punishing him with anything around him like the spanish table & barricade.  They traded momentum finding different ways to counter each others signature moves while Shawn was bleeding around his eye with factors like a chair & Lita herself playing a big role here.  This was what you expected from this match but a little known fact is that it had it's long term effect on Shawn as this is the match that started the effects that gave him his ""lazy eye"" that we've seen to this day.

vs. Edge - Kane was out for revenge for not only Edge costing him his World Title opportunity but also stealing Lita away in the process which he showed from the start being very dominate by beating on Edge in the corner while also heavily choking him using both a death grip & the ring ropes before sending Edge off the apron to the floor with a hard punch & into the ring post back first to the point where Lita tried to cause a distraction to no avail.  Edge was able to catch a break when he was able to send Kane into the post followed by a spear allowing him to focus on Kane's ribs keeping him grounded as both men traded momentum with both men catching each other in mid-air with offensive moves while Kane continued to use his power moves like a sidewalk slam & big boot while Lita & Snitsky tried to make their presence known.  This came off like the grudge match it was intended to be as Kane was the most motivated that we've seen him around that time while Edge & Lita were starting to come into their own as the heel couple that would later be remembered for.
Vengeance '05

This was originally released as a bonus DVD to purchase with the ""See No Evil"" DVD for only a very cheap price.  This was actually Kane's first DVD set that is a no-frills release 1 disc set that's just strictly the matches with no host, extras, or anything (""Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane"" DVD that would come years later would have all of that).  I would recommend this for Kane fans who just want to be able to watch his matches in one session.",1169596800,13,5547,4.415279138099902
