5309744,5,B009AVCADK,"I have never written a review before but, I can not say enough great things about this DVD. I wish that I found it sooner as I'm in my 3rd trimester now! Pre-pregnancy, I was extremely active- going to the gym everyday, etc. This is the first pregnancy video I have found that give any decent workout. I love that I can customize it! You can workout 10-60min! I'm a bit sore the next day! I am finally feeling strong again, and not huge and out-of-shape! Really wish I had found this sooner!! It is easy to follow along, and very modern....Highly recommend!!!",1360540800,19,559,4.436893203883495
5309745,5,B009AVCADK,"Good DVD. Easy to follow. Would recommend. Good all throughout pregnancy. Has cardio, strength, & yoga. The stretching feels great.",1359849600,,131,5.6
5309746,5,B009AVCADK,This in my second pregnancy and I'm 3 months in. I've been feeling exhausted and tired so thought I'd give this a try and absolutely loved it.  I'm not a highly active girl to start with so I like that you can mix and match work out to fit your level and schedule. The 10 minutes sections make it easy to break up your workout through out the day if you have a busy schedule or an energetic toddler. The DVD also offers sections on how to work out with a birthing ball or get in some exercises at work.,1359417600,3,502,4.02
5309747,5,B009AVCADK,"I love that each segment is only 10 minutes. The 3 cardio segments were challenging, but not overly so. It was very much like aerobics, and sometimes hard to follow since it was fast paced. I am sure after doing those segments a few times, it will be easier. The Mind, Body, Baby segment was very nice and relaxing. There were several stretches on there that I had never even tried before. Cute to the Core was the easiest work out segment (not counting the mind/body segment of course!), and Buns in the oven was challenging for me. There was also upper body work on that one, too.
This DVD has a good mix of intensities, and has a customizable feature where you can pick and chose what workouts to play.",1359331200,3,705,4.3893129770992365
5309748,5,B009AVCADK,Great especially for pregnant women who are out of shape or don't really know how to work out now that they're pregnant. Each workout is approximately 10 minutes so you can work up to the recommended 30 minutes if you're really out of shape.,1358640000,3,241,4.5
5309749,5,B009AVCADK,"I love that the different workouts are broken down into 10 minutes... this way to can do a few of them and have time in between to check on my toddler to make sure everythings ok before starting the next workout.  The best thing is I actually feel like I got a good workout without exhausting myself.  It's so important to keep active while pregnant and this dvd makes it possible for a full time working mom, housekeeper, cook, wife to be able to stay active :)",1358294400,9,462,4.2988505747126435
5309750,4,B009AVCADK,Really enjoyed the cardio sections but found the strength and stretching sections to be lacking in intensity.  Overall this DVD was definitely worth it even for just the cardio sections!,1358121600,,186,5.2
5309751,4,B009AVCADK,"I consider myself physically active, and when I became pregnant things changed. My usual routines became unbearable. This workout DVD allows you to take advantage of 10 minute workouts, from cardio to light strength to stretching, all with pilates and yoga influence. I feel like I am targeting the areas of my body which are becoming weak and flabby because of the pregnancy, and this makes for a really satisfying workout. If you don't have 40 minutes, switch your workouts to 10 minutes a piece throughout the day. Either way, there is something about starting a workout that is only 10 minutes that makes me want to do more and more...",1357862400,17,639,4.7657657657657655
5309752,5,B009AVCADK,"I purchased this for my daughter, who just found out she is expecting.  She loves the workouts. It provides a good variety.",1357862400,4,123,4.590909090909091
5309753,5,B009AVCADK,"I just bought this dvd today and I'm not going to lie I was a bit questionable on it because I thought it was going to be super easy like the workout video I just bought the week before, but after doing some of the workouts today I must say I completely love this workout video. I like how there are different types of cardio and strength workouts so I won't have to do the same thing ever day. I also love how its actually makes me work up a sweat and it made for all trimesters with women from their 1st trimester in the video to about to pop and of course some of the workouts have water downed options for those who are farther along. I would recommend this to anyone it really is a great work out at a really great price.",1356912000,44,726,4.0137931034482754
5309784,4,B009AVCADK,"The best thing I like is that the workouts are 10 minutes long.  I'm not an exercise lover, but know I need to keep my cardio up for healthy circulation, so 10 minutes is perfect for me!  I do one cardio, and the stretch workout and then change it up the next day.  There are 3 different categories; cardio, strength and stretch.  It's very easy to follow. I'd recommend this DVD for those mothers that want to be healthy and active but don't want to work out for 45 minutes (although you could work out for 45 minutes if you wanted to do all the work outs on the DVD).",1484438400,2,569,4.1454545454545455
5309785,1,B009AVCADK,"If you worked out at all before pregnancy, these workouts will not feel like workouts at all - they'll feel more like you're aimlessly moving your feet & arms around while pretending to ""work out."" I'm not an athlete by any means - I don't run, & I only work out for about 30 minutes a day. Maybe I'll circle back to this DVD when I'm 8-9 months... but for the first trimester, this is NOT what I would consider a workout. Plus, I find the instructor to be kind of annoying, & I don't like the dance-inspired moves - they just feel silly.

If you're looking for a good workout DVD with some real resistance training, try PregoFit, Karyne Steben, & Lindsay Brin.",1482796800,,661,4.330645161290323
5309786,5,B009AVCADK,"Some of the routines are a little on the easy side, but I like that I can customize my workout and keeps me moving. I would say it's definitely not for the very active/fit momma-to-be, but it's great to get a little movement in your daily routine.",1479340800,,247,4.276595744680851
5309787,1,B009AVCADK,"I really loved this bra at first, and then tonight when I was taking it off it broke! It's cheaply made and I can no longer tighten the straps. I'm pretty bummed too because it was actually very comfy and supportive but obviously not anymore now that I can't tighten the straps.",1478649600,,278,4.365384615384615
5309788,5,B009AVCADK,"I'm not athletic by any means. Prior to pregnancy I would work out sporadically, but that first trimester nausea really put a stop to any movement that wasn't necessary. Into my second trimester I noticed how out of breath I would become over anything and really wanted to do a light 30 minute workout 5-6 days a week. This workout is perfect! I typically do one cardio, one strength, and the stretch each day. These workouts are enough to get my heart rate up and make me break a little sweat without over doing it.",1478131200,,516,4.442105263157894
5309789,4,B009AVCADK,"Very energetic and the instructor is also pregnant which gives you motivation. Nice, easy, and short segments which gives you a burn",1477699200,,132,5.045454545454546

5309792,5,B009AVCADK,"Quirky but great workouts for pregnancy. Best part is you can do them with a lot more weight, deeper squats, etc., and create a more challenging workout if that's what you're used to.",1474761600,,183,4.575757575757576
5309793,3,B009AVCADK,This was ok. I was hoping for a more difficult work out. But still for the price it was good. Obviously the work out feels harder when you are 9 months pregnant.,1474329600,,161,4.0625
5309806,5,B009AVCADK,I absolutely love this workout video! I used it while pregnant with my first son as well as when I was pregnant with my twins! It was also great to do to slowly get you back working out after delivery. I would recommend this to anyone.,1466985600,,235,4.130434782608695
5309807,4,B009AVCADK,"I like this video. Personally I find the dance and the stretching sections awkward, but the rest is great. I usually do 3 sections twice and definitely get a low impact full body workout. The narrator lady has really awful puns and makes a few cringey comments like when she tells you your normal workout clothes ""probably"" don't fit. #rude. Lol",1463443200,,345,4.672131147540983
5309808,5,B009AVCADK,Best video out there for expecting moms. One of the segments is available on YouTube I would view that one and purchase the did if you like what you see!,1459728000,2,153,4.133333333333334

5309810,4,B009AVCADK,"This is a good workout. It has three programs to pick from. A cardio, weights, and stretching/cool down. The cardio and weights have three workouts to pick from, and they are about 10 mins. each. I have been doing one cardio, one weights/core and the stretching each day, for a total of 30 mins. I sleep a ton better after I do them and my weight has stay fairly low. My doctor said I am doing well, and staying on track. I will say, as I get farther along, the workouts do seem to be alittle harder to do, my belly gets in the way. But all in all, its a good workout and I plan to use it the rest of this pregnancy and the next (if there is one).",1456790400,,647,3.946564885496183

5309813,1,B009AVCADK,"If you worked out before your pregnancy, do not expect much of a work out with this specific DVD. The cardio circuit is 10 minutes and your heart rate hardly gets elevated.  The strengthen portion is less than 10 minutes as well. I'm not sure why pregnancy instructors have to be corny but they are.  Last, the instructor does not give you instruction before the moves are executed. They explain it as they are doing the move so you fumble a bit.  I think I will stick to my elliptical.",1450137600,2,486,4.377777777777778
5309814,5,B009AVCADK,"My favorite pregnancy workout DVD!  Good mix of cardio, toning and stretching.  6 10 minute segments so you can customize your workout.  Not too intense but still gets your heart rate up.  Love it!",1449705600,,197,4.705882352941177
5309815,2,B009AVCADK,"This is a bit too easy, I'm in my third trimester but maybe it will be better for working out right around due date. Also, the woman in the beginning talks so much and it would be better if she just didn't have something to say every workout and instead it would just go to the workout...",1447632000,,288,4.0701754385964914
5309837,5,B009AVCADK,"I got this from the library so I could try it before I bought it, and I really enjoyed it.  No, it's not a Jillian Michaels type knock you on your butt workout, but that wasn't really what I was looking for. Before being pregnant I did a lot of yoga and some Zumba, I'd say I was in pretty average shape.

Being pregnant in the Ohio winter, I just wanted something to get me moving that isn't totally boring.  The workouts are easy to follow, a lot of the moves I recognized from Zumba, so if you are a fan of Zumba you will probably like this.  I like that they are in 10 minute segments so you can mix it up depending on how much time you have. The different workouts incorporate arm and butt exercise.  The girls in the video are really relaxed, talking and laughing with each other, which I like. It be kind of cheesy, but who cares? Just be silly and go with it.

All in all, it gets my heart rate up and my muscles feel a little sore the next day.",1447632000,2,953,4.015873015873016
5309838,5,B009AVCADK,"These were great workouts for while I was pregnant! The instructors are very sweet and talk about how special it is to be pregnant. I even got a little teary eyed with all those hormones going crazy. I loved the barefoot workout since my feet were so swollen, and the stretching segment always  felt good at the end of the day.",1445558400,2,327,4.360655737704918

5309845,5,B009AVCADK,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this DVD!  I ordered separate cardio and yoga DVDs prior to getting this one and was not impressed with either one.  This DVD has so many different 10 minute workouts.  It's easy to customize a plan that includes cardio, strength and stretching.  The ladies leading the sessions were not at all annoying.  I can put 4 segments together to get 40 minutes all at once or just pop in the DVD for a quick 10 before I start my day.  I should have gotten this one in the first place!",1438214400,,492,4.236559139784946
5309846,3,B009AVCADK,"Background: I am 6 months pregnant now, and have been using this DVD 1-2 times per week throughout the second trimester.  Before my pregnancy, I worked out regularly at the gym (45 minutes of cardio 3-4 times per week), and used other exercise DVDs at home on other days of the week (I am partial to Jillian Michaels).  So, when I began looking for a pregnancy DVD, I had in mind a workout that would keep me toned and fit throughout my pregnancy.  I am also not one who has ever sought out dance or yoga for my workouts.

This DVD has 6 10-minute segments.  10 minutes isn't quite enough time to get a good workout going, and just when it feels like it's starting, the segment ends.  Of the 6 segments, there is one cardio and one strength segment I like, which I can pair together for a 20-minute workout.  After that, I have to either do a segment that isn't nearly as rigorous, or repeat a segment, which doesn't hold my attention.  The other segments are based on dance or yoga moves, which wasn't what I was looking for.  I also like the stretching segment, which is a good way to cool down but isn't a workout itself.

Also, there are no good suggestions from the instructors for how to intensify the workouts.  After the first few times I worked out with this DVD, the workouts stopped feeling much like workouts.

This is a good DVD for anyone who doesn't work out much regularly, but if you're used to more intensive workouts, you may want to look elsewhere.  This will feel like a very simple DVD, and the workouts will stop being interesting rapidly.  They are largely dance or yoga based, which does not provide much for people who are looking for something with more intensive cardio or toning.",1437436800,,1708,4.45016077170418

The workouts keep you entertained and are over before you know it! I also loved that it incorporated talk about babies and motherhood and promoted bonding and appreciating yourself, baby, and belly. I normally did three videos at a time, but it was nice to have an option to just do 10 minutes on those extra tired days.

There are several workouts to choose from including cardio, weight training, and pilates. I usually do about 20 minutes worth and by the end I feel like I have had a great workout without being exhausted or overly sore.

5310012,5,B009AVCADK,"I got this from the library to see if I would like it and ended up purchasing it. I love how you can choose from 6 ten minute work outs depending on how you feel. Some days I just do one 10 minute workout, other days I do two or three 10 min workouts. it has 3 cardio, 2 core and 1 stretch workout. I started it at 30 weeks with very little exercise previously in my pregnancy(unless you count chasing 3 little boys around exercise!). I worked out before I got pregnant but felt so nauseous and tired I wasn't up to it for awhile. Finally getting back into a little shape before delivery and I love this! I tried the Tracey Anderson workouts, but they were a little more advanced for my current physical state and I honestly didn't have time to workout for 40-50 mins each day. During the exercises in this DVD they even add in kegels which is great since I so often forget to do them. Some of the moves are a little cheesy but you'll be more embarrassed during delivery ;-) after delivery I will probably start back on this before I do my hardcore Jillian Michaels workouts so I don't push my body too hard, too fast. Even if you have another workout, get this for those days you don't have a lot of time and just need a short but effective workout!",1420588800,,1250,4.190871369294606

I cannot stand Heidi's voice, so I am turned off since she talks at the beginning of each workout with some corny saying.

I do like the instructor on the last three.  I use the mind and body as a cool down/stretch routine after I run.  Perhaps this workout will be fantastic when I'm over 30 weeks, but as of right now I am sticking with running and ""Knocked up Fitness"".",1395964800,3,563,4.273584905660377

5310145,5,B009AVCADK,"Writing from the perspective of 20 weeks along and feeling a bit out of shape:

Pros:
-good variety so you won't be bored
-you can decide in what order and which segments you want to do on a specific day
-fun, non-annoying music
-upbeat and effective (sore muscles the next day)
-reasonably priced

Cons:
-stretches are a bit fast in the stretching/breathing portion
-as mentioned by others, the section on kegels was disappointing and worthless

Overall: if you're not super-fit but want to feel healthy and toned during your pregnancy, this is a great workout which will keep you motivated, huffing and puffing (depending on how much energy you decide to put into it) and feeling good about your growing baby and body.

I was impressed that I was able to feel the burn in these workouts even though thy are low impact. Before becoming pregnant, I went the gym 3-4 times a week and did free weights and high impact cardio. I had complications with my pregnancy and was restricted to very low impact exercising.

5310165,5,B009AVCADK,"...it gets the job done.  It's a very moderate workout, meaning pretty safe to do if you're pregnant.  Normally I'm in pretty good shape and enjoy doing some intense workouts, but during my first trimester I had bad morning sickness symptoms along with a bad case of vertigo.  It took about a month and a half before my head started to feel normal again so I pretty much stopped working out all together during this time.  When I started to feel like I could start moving my body again without being sea-sick and fatigued, I wanted to start with something I could easily do every day from home.  I bought this video, and just like starting out with any workout after a layoff it definitely challenged me.  After about a week and a half I started to acclimate and added some light weights to the cardio sections.  For the ladies that say it's not much, what you get out of a workout depends on what you put into it.  I do aspects of this video daily, and vary the intensity by deepening the lunges or squats, and adding weight or adjusting the weight depending on which section I'm doing.  Pregnancy workouts shouldn't leave you overheated and out of breath, it's not good for the baby.  Just like everyone else I find that the 10 minute segments are great for working around each particular day.  And now that I've been diagnosed with partial previa, I have to keep things a little lighter, and with this video I have no problem doing that either.  I'm determined with this pregnancy to not let myself go like I did with my first, and thank goodness for this video for helping me do that.",1384128000,,1588,4.4567474048442905

I am only 17 weeks right now, so I'm sure an easier workout will be welcomed by the end of my pregnancy. It also kind of bugs me that the lady talks at the beginning of each segment. With two kids I have limited time to work out, so I just want to get on with it instead of listening to her talk. I do like that you can chose which sections you want to do depending on how much time you have or what you feel like doing that day.",1371600000,2,576,3.7295081967213113
5310231,4,B009AVCADK,"I recently found I was pregnant with baby number two and really want to maintain my healty and fit lifestyle through this pregnancy because last pregnancy I gained 50 lbs and it took me 2 yrs to work it off :( I had heard WTE had put out a video and all the results were so positive so I gave it a go.

I really enjoy this DVD!! I love how there are 3 different cardio segments, that even though they differ in difficulty level I can still get a feeling of having worked out well with each of them. I also like the two toning choices one for core and one for total body. The toning segmens really give you a burn (not so much you are gonna drop) just enough to let you know you worked out. Lastly, I enjoyed the two bonus segments on the birthing ball and how to stay comfy at work.

As for the Instructors I enjoyed them. The cardio lady is very upbeat and pregnant so you don't feel discouraged, and the toning lady is very calm and things go very slowly so as to avoid injury.

The only Con I can come up with is in the Instant Video version you are unable to easily switch through your segments which really takes up a lot of time and can be quite frustrating :(

All in all I love this dvd and the All in 1 fitness it provides!",1371600000,3,1232,3.9959349593495936
5310232,3,B009AVCADK,"I bought this DVD early on in my pregnancy and used it 1 time. Te workout was ok, not as intense as I am used too. I went to use it the other day and it no longer works. It plays the introduction and then nothing. Have tried several times and in various DVD players. There are no scratches on the DVD. I'm disappointed....anyone know who I can contact about replacement/refund?",1371254400,,377,4.323943661971831
5310233,5,B009AVCADK,"This workout is perfect for me. Its upbeat, fun, and challenging. There is a great blend of cardio, strength, and yoga based workouts to target all the key areas that are needed during labor and delivery and beyond. I usually do five of the six workouts any given time I exercise and I always work up a good sweat with them. It's challenging for the average mom I would say, but not unbearable. I had a dvd workout that I used before this but it didn't do nearly as much for my core or pelvic floor. What's best is that it's actually modern (it doesn't look or sound like it was made in the 90s, like nearly every other pregnancy video I've seen regardless of when it came out), and they talk to you wonderfully. I love how they are encouraging to you and talk sweetly to you and your baby throughout the video.

The only cons I could come up with for this video (and they are by no means deal-breakers for me) are that the instruction-free version is really weird. All they did was mute the voices. The instructors are still talking and you can see their mouth move, but the voices are muted and you just hear the music. Could have been done a little better, but I always use the instruction part anyway because I think it's more fun so I don't really care about that. Heidi Murkoff also introduces each workout beforehand. Her voice is quite annoying, but you can skip right past that ""chapter"" and go straight to the workout. The only other thing I found weird was the second set of instructors/girls for the strength set seem to have a weird chemistry. The two girls that workout behind the instructor seem unenthused about the workout. That being said, I don't really care about it, it's just noticeable to me. I definitely think this is the best pregnancy workout I've seen so far, and I had to stretch to come up with those cons. Definitely worth the money!",1370822400,4,1864,4.4186046511627906
5310234,4,B009AVCADK,"A little cheesy but fun. I like that the segments are each 10 minutes & you can create your own workout. I feel like I get a nice workout from it. It's not too intense either. Overall, I would recommend it to friends.",1369958400,,217,4.069767441860465
5310235,5,B009AVCADK,This is my second pregnancy and unlike my first I am looking to keep as fit as possible. This DVD offers several selections that can keep workouts short on those days you are not feeling it but also allows you to get in a long workout on the days you feel like there's no stopping you. I will buy this as a shower gift for friends and family moving forward.,1369872000,,357,4.114285714285714
5310236,4,B009AVCADK,"This is a great workout that gets your heart pumping and body moving. It includes ten 6 minute workouts. Three for cardio, two for strength training, and one for mind/soul (similar to yoga/stretching). It also includes bonus material for kegal exercises and other helpful information. You can also create a customized workout. I usually do two cardio, one strength training, and finish with the mind/soul exercise. Some of the cardio moves are a bit cheesy but if you go with it and let go, you'll build up a sweat and maybe enjoy it too. The strength training workout is really good for your core, arms, and legs. All in all, I recommend this purchase.",1368662400,3,653,4.7368421052631575
5310237,5,B009AVCADK,This is probably a workout for someone who didn't already work out all thetime. For me it has been great because I hardly exercised before I got preganant and it isn't too strenuous. It is a great workout though and I love that I can pick and choose what type of exercise I want to do and how long I want to do it. I can tell it is working because my mucsles are generally pretty sore thenext day which tells me I must be doing someting right. : ),1367712000,3,447,3.977777777777778

5310240,4,B009AVCADK,"There are 6 10 min workouts that vary in degree of difficulty. This is great for the expecting mother. there is no obligation to continue working out if fatigued after 10 mins, but there's an option to continue to another workout if one wants to keep going. I love the yoga/stretching workout!",1366848000,,293,4.653846153846154
5310241,4,B009AVCADK,"I think this video is great, especially for someone like me who (pre-pregnancy) wasn't over weight but still out of shape.  It has multiple workouts for Cardio, Strength, and Stretching.  They use basic cardio (nothing too strenuous), yoga, Pilates and LOTS of Kegels! I love that they put in Kegels!

They do a good job showing ladies at various weeks of pregnancy with the ladies in the later weeks doing modified versions of the workouts.  Each workout also gives you the option of watching with the instructor voice over or just to music.

With all the different options, you can truly customize your workout.  You can do just one for a 10 minute quick stretch or multiple for a full body work out.

I don't think you can get a workout video that isn't a little cheesy but this one isn't too bad.",1366243200,,800,4.5524475524475525
5310242,4,B009AVCADK,"One of my favorite workouts. I use this product 3-4 times per week. I love the mix and match nature of the segments. They get your heart rate up and challenge but end before becoming overwhelming. Good cardio sections, nice mix of pilates and toning work. Some sections are more difficult for your high energy days and some more gentle for your not-so-great days. I found the ""host"" Heidi to be VERY annoying but you can just fast forward past her useless, cutesy ramblings. Love that all the ladies working out are pregnant and have different ability levels. Trainers are good about providing the adjustments that might need to be made depending on how far along you are.

I would definitely recommend this for busy ladies in their 1st and 2nd trimester looking to start a flexible workout routine.  I've slowly been able to build up to 3-4 sections in a row now. This product has become a vital part of my pregnancy routine.",1364860800,,926,4.640243902439025
5310243,5,B009AVCADK,This product allows you to do as little or as much as you want. Love the option to have instruction or music only. Plus customize your workout is awesome. I enjoy this DVD a lot. Highly recommended.,1364860800,,198,4.378378378378378

5310247,5,B009AVCADK,The cardio alone was worth the DVD. I really like it and get a lot out of the workout. Favorite part is that I can customize the workout exercises to the order I want and the length I want.,1361404800,,189,3.871794871794872
5310248,3,B009AVCADK,"This DVD has 6 ten-minute workouts -- three ""cardio"", two ""strength"" and one relaxation. I've done the first five, and nothing felt particularly taxing. (I'm about 7 months pregnant and worked out regularly before becoming pregnant.) They're pretty informal, with lots of giggles from the women doing the routines, which could be either fun or annoying, depending on what you like in a workout video. I like that you can build a custom workout from the six segments, and the workouts themselves, if not overly challenging, at least feel pretty good. The extras are nice, too. If you were in good shape before getting pregnant, this might be a little too low-key for you, but it's fun, and I'm finding it a nice way to inject some variety into my workout routines.

Details about the segments (~10 minutes each):

Cardio:
(These feel to me like they're lead by Barbie, Skipper, and their friend -- but they're fun. None of them really gets me breathing hard at this point, but they do raise my heart rate some.)
(1) Barefoot and Pregnant -- a ""gentle Pilates-based workout"" (all standing). This segment has a lot of rocking, taps, knee-lifts, gentle lunges, and arm motions. Basically a warm-up.
(2) Baby Bump Boot Camp -- Divided into 4 mini-segments: (a) Squats and knee lifts, (b) Lunges and knee lifts, (c) Upper-body (very, very gentle) kickboxing with hamstring curls (d) Lower-body kickboxing. I have to be careful not to overextend during part (d), but overall this workout is also quite gentle and has useful, low-intensity moves.
(3) Baby Steps -- Very low-impact, choreographed dancing. This is maybe the most fun for me, now that I'm used to the routine. It has some belly-dancing-inspired moves, followed by a dance that's pretty typical for dance aerobics. I don't think it's as challenging as, say, walking briskly up a hill, but it's enjoyable.

Strength:
(1) Cute to the Core: Very gentle core routine. They're careful about not having you lie on your back or do anything like traditional crunches, which I appreciate. Includes kegels with some of the exercises. This workout feels pretty good to me, in general, although I could (at this point) stand for more of a challenge.
(2) Buns in the Oven: Overall strength routine. It's easy to control the intensity of this workout by choosing appropriate weights. I think I get more out of this routine than I do from the others, but I'm still doing other strength exercises on alternate days.

Stretch and relax:
(1) Mind, Body, and Baby: I've only done this once, but it felt pretty good. It seemed like more stretching than ""mind"" work. :-)

Like I said, I appreciate the Bonus Features -- kegels, ball work, and ""workstation workout"" which is basically stretching in a chair. Overall, the best part of this workout DVD, for me, is the variety and the possibility of building different workouts from the segments.",1361404800,67,2877,4.875255623721881
5310249,5,B009AVCADK,"I wanted an easy workout as I'm not one of those crazy women who run around, go to the gym, engage in running etc. during their third trimester. I love this because it's a 'careful' workout and you can do from 10 to 60 min. if you want. Great for stretching, building muscle and getting your heart rate going.",1361318400,3,309,4.254237288135593

8538755,5,B009AVCADK,"I'm not generally a fan of exercise dvds (although I'm not new to exercise- I was running regularly several times a week until a month or so ago). However, I've been pleasantly surprised by this. I injured my back and so haven't been able to carry on running and find it tricky finding time to get out of the house to go to the gym etc. I'm now in my 2nd trimester and am really enjoying this dvd. I think it's a really good mix-up and a good overall workout ideal for us that want to do some cardio and core work etc but don't have time to spend ages concentrating on each individually. The first instructor is a bit cheesy but it is bearable and although I've done it several times it has enough variety in it that it hasn't got boring yet.
