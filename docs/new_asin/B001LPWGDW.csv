8319379,4,B001LPWGDW,I love a good low-budget horror movie and this was a good low-budget horror movie with it's tongue stuck firmly in it's cheek.,1408492800,,126,4.521739130434782
8319380,5,B001LPWGDW,"This movie is a riot--- funny, scary and creepy at the same time. Very low low budget but it is way better than other films with million dollar budgets. The whole feel of the film is inventive-- well worth watching as long as you realize that everything in the film is INTENTIONAL. You're supposd to laugh and boy did I! I'm waiting for the next film made by these guys!",1367020800,,370,4.3
8319381,3,B001LPWGDW,"""Small Town Folk"" is a horror-comedy tale about a group of people who get lost and find themselves in the small hamlet of Grockleton which is the home of a group of inbred lunatics.  I am sure that sounds familiar to you.  The film takes place in the middle of nowhere in England which provides a bit of a different locale for many horror movie fans. The Grockleton residents are on the hunt for a pregnant woman to provide them with a normal child to help rise them out of their inbred morass.  The film is obviously low budget and is shot with a ton of eccentric angles and CGI camerawork.  It does give the viewer a sense of being a bit off-kilter which works for the film.  However, the ""Small Town Folk"" are too stupid to seem to be much of a threat to the outsiders who they refer to as ""Grockles"" for some reason.  The protagonists are not rocket scientists themselves which makes for a frustrating viewing experience because they do lots of idiotic things that most normal people would never do.  ""Small Town Folk"" offers something a bit unique to this sub-genre of horror but does not make for an entertaining or essential viewing experience.",1365379200,,1151,4.5048076923076925
8319382,1,B001LPWGDW,"What a ponderous film this was.  If there's comedy, I somehow missed it, maybe it's a British thing.  The bad folks are certainly horrors to look at, with teeth that are horrors in themselves.  But the bad guys got on my nerves because they were so smug and sure of themselves.  The bad guys characters were also a bit over the top in terms of being way too hammy for my taste.  The good guy characters were not much better: a young kid who looks a little like a very young Richard Burton, wearing a bicycle helmet, but does stupid things like whistling when the bad guys are lurking nearby.  The traveler and his wife are quite hapless, the guy with a hat that makes him look like an Australian.  This guy keeps getting hit in the head by various bad guys, ends up falling onto the ground, but never seems to get knocked out, and he's the one without the helmet.  Most of his acting seems to have gone into bulgy-eyed stares of dread at his circumstances.  Toward the beginning of the film, he and his wife go into this forbidden area inhabited by the previously described misfits after having been warned.  They end up at the mansion and ask for a room.  The chief bad guy gets them a room, but should have said something like, ""You realize this is a ""Dead and Breakfast"" but the movie misses it chance at even that bad pun.  Dialogue is really dreadful overall, the pace ends up becoming monotonous.  The good guys end up killing all of the bad guys but I don't really know how they managed it.  Suggest you save this film for last on your list.",1344297600,,1548,4.329861111111111
8319383,4,B001LPWGDW,"Not bad, not bad at all. Little money was spent on this movie, but it was well filmed and does have it good parts. Funny, but a horror movie you should give a try.",1325203200,,163,3.823529411764706
8319384,1,B001LPWGDW,this film is literally like watching a very bad high school play recorded by someones parents on the family camcorder. save your money and don't buy this complete cinematic flop.,1303689600,,178,4.966666666666667
8319385,1,B001LPWGDW,"""Small Town Folk"" has a cutesy title and a cool Dvd cover and then it goes downhill and never climbs back up.  Mostly scenes of British rednecks who kill anyone who venture into their small town of Grockleton.  Most of the maniacs have grossly bad teeth, but i just chalked that up to British dentistry. The movie is pretty much unwatchable despite the gore and I checked out of Grockleton about half way through. And I couldn't even bear to watch the ""Leprachaun"" himself, Warwick Davis being carried around on the back of a giant retard.

You have been warned-this is a movie for people who like bad teeth, bad breath and bad taste.  And oh, those British hillbillies are so proper, one even wears a derby.",1246924800,3,708,4.551181102362205
8319386,5,B001LPWGDW,"looks like a local tv access sereal was turned ino a movie.  the cast is not pretty but charismatic.  very good acting.  flaws in filming but completely forgiveable.  this is a delightful film.  it should have been crap but this crap was made by eating diamonds, emeralds, and gold.  it's the old 'if you get lost on your trip you don't want to end up in this town'.  i believe this would win almost any film competition if it were entered.  and yet it is low budget and there are filming flaws [like: where'd that tree come from?  it wasn't there a minute ago.]
it's don't enter this little town.  like 'house of wax', 'the texas chainsaw masacre',  'delverence', ...  yet this film isn't really comparable to any of those.  there's not a lot of gore.  it does remind me a little bit of 'hide and creep'. [which i, also, recommend.  a zombie film with litte blood and lots of funny lines and scenes.  if you like big money films, keep away.  these 2 films would be good for training ideas for low budget filming.",1239235200,3,1013,4.389189189189189
8319387,3,B001LPWGDW,"I have to say that Small Town Folk is a very different kind of horror. It has a lot of qualities that are in a class by itself. Although very low budget they shot this movie with unbelievable style. With green screen effects and some great nature scenes that are unlike any other. Small town is not a straight forward horror. It shows us a fantasy/comedy/slasher movie instead. The characters are all very interesting even though there a more than a handful of villians. It helps make it more convincing being in a small town would you think there would be than two or three people living there. I only give this 3 stars because while it was a great to watch and very interesting it lacked in some areas. It never becomes scary. Watching this you find yourself saying there is in no way I would get killed by these idiots. None of the villians have an I.Q what so ever. While making the film funny it does not bring any fear to the viewers. Looking at the characters you would think they would be scary, but after watching and listening to the cruel deliberate scoundrels you find the comedic quality over powering compared to the seriousness that it should have entailed. It has a few moments of good gore but lacked in that department as well. So really those are the only two things the film lacked, but for some reason that makes it only a little above average.

 A couple by the names of Jon and Susan who are taking a road trip find themselves lost. As they approach a man on the side of the road they pull over to ask for directions. He seems to be talking rubbish and speaking as though another guy is there with them. After a minute or so a tiny man pops up from on his back. The two wierdos tell the couple not take to go into the town called Grockleton, it doesn't seem to be on the map. Of course the couple decide to go there anyway to find a place to sleep for the night. After discovering the locals are as weird and crazy as they seem the couple and a few others have to try and escape alive.

 Small Town Folk is a fun and different experience. It will never be in the top greats of all time. But for the horror fans who like low budget films and are really sick of most of the terrible Hollywood horrors than this will be a breath of fresh air.",1237507200,4,2262,4.229166666666667
