5359997,5,B009OE2O70,Excellent DVD transfer.  Pristine picture.  Would like to see TGG Direct do the same with Stuart Woods mini series CHIEFS!!  I would buy several copies of CHIEFS if priced in the same range as GEORGE WASHINGTON and same quality.,1361577600,,228,4.794871794871795
5359998,3,B009OE2O70,"In 1984 I recorded the George Washington mini-series on VHS.  I've waited for a decent DVD of this great portrayal of the Father of our Country for years.  I passed on opportunities to purchase an unauthorized copy transferred to DVD in hope that one day someone would release an officially sanctioned copy. Imagine my surprise when I spotted this on Amazon.com.  I quickly pre-ordered it and finally it arrived in time for Washington's Birthday. I started watching the first disc and was pleased with the video and sound quality considering the age of the TV mini-series.  Suddenly I noticed that a large chunk of the program was missing.  From 1765 to 1775, the period where Washington's patriot views were clarified, his break with the Fairfax Family, and his call to the First Continental Congress had been left out.  I know this was part of the original series.  I would have preferred to have received all of the original George Washington mini-series and skipped part 2 ""The Forging of a Nation"". I wanted to give this disc a higher rating, but nothing suggested this was to be an Abridged Version of the original which I would not have purchased.  If you fondly remember the original and want to own it on DVD, this is only part of it.  If you are new to the mini-series, you will probably wonder why the storyline jumps far ahead with no explanation of what happened, why Washington's friends are gone, and GW is standing before congress in Philadelphia ten years after the last scene.  This could have been a great release, but I find the omission of a major portion of the film makes it disappointing to me.",1361491200,174,1618,4.6855123674911665
5359999,5,B009OE2O70,"Great Mini Series
I don't know where the other comments came from but my copy is 480 min and 240 min (12 hrs. long). If it's a cut version I'm glad the commericals are not there.",1361491200,,178,3.9722222222222223
5360000,1,B009OE2O70,"What a piece of crap and cheap version of a great miniseries

... this DVD set was cut down from 8 hours (480 minutes  AS ADVERTISED ON THE BOX to just over 5 3/4 for the first miniseries ... TOO LITTLE to ACCOUNT FOR COMMERCIALS!!! ... the disk is broken up into 6 sections and is about 3:12 long if you play is all at once ... 1-5 is the first day and seems to have all of the orginal first day's show .... and #6 is 45 minutes of a 2 and 1/2 hour episode ... most or part 2 is missing including the introduction of the second day ... disk two is the third and final day and it too seems to have been edited, but not as bad ... it is about 2 hours and 20 minutes long in three section ... 6-9

If this is not fixed .... AVOID THIS ITEM.

Added ... I talked to TGG DCirect that made the DVD set.  A representative is looking into this problem  ... he was unaware that the set was short.  His DVD set is 3 disks, not 5 as some have said.  Part 2 of the set is Forging of a Nation, the second miniseries.  of the 240 minutes advertised, the second set is just over 3 hours long.

One more note ... the original VHS tape set was 3 tapes for part #1 and was the whole miniseries.  Part #2 had two tapes and was complete.

I posted that I contacted TGG Direst LLc on Friday (who made the set) and they are looking into this ... I posted the TGG telephone number as (856) 669-2561.  I urge everyone who got a t bad set to call them and complain.  Maybe the the SQUEEKY wheel can get the grease and make them redo the set with all the miniseries and send us the replacement disks.  The more people they hear from, the more they will take this seriously.",1361404800,33,1647,3.9186746987951806
5360001,5,B009OE2O70,For some reason I received a five disc set (Amazon site posts a 3 disc set). The first 3 discs are listed as simply George Washington and portray Barry Boswick as GW from the French and Indian War until the end of the US Revolution. The 4th and 5th discs are titled George Washington Forging a nation witch portray Barry Boswick again as GW during his complete 2 terms in office as the first US President. Is this the correct movie that everybody else received or is this a completely different movie of George Washington unrelated to the the one posted here?,1361404800,,559,4.490196078431373
5360002,4,B009OE2O70,"I would rate this as a 90 out of 100 on fresh o meter-type scale, just couldn't get the sliding bar to make the fifth star a half.  I have been waiting for years for this quality production to be released on DVD as the VHS offerings were gouge-fest city aka cost-prohibitive.  The value pendulum has finally swung the other way (praise be Hallelujah) in 2013 as my DVD arrived the day after president's day. This epic spans 50 years-plus years in the life of ""the Indispensable"" George Washington and the actor Barry Bostwick is to be commended as he is has to show a wide age range over the course of this three disk epic  (Part One is 480 minutes and Part Two is 240) and I would say he brings some zing and spice to the portrayal, mixing the expected facade of serious and stately and dignified with charm, warmth, anger and self-doubt.
  Why no five star masterpiece  rating?  A few times the plot and exposition gets lazy. One example of where a botched factoid in the storytelling damages credibility is in disc 3 when a graphic on screen says August 1792 and shows Jefferson congratulating Washington on his re-election as president  (weren't all presidential elections then as now held the first Tuesday in November)?  The cast includes some familiar faces, but a few corners are cut here as well as the actor playing General Knox for example seemed to be too young looking and lacking in gravitas to rise to the rank of general and later Secretary of War.  He is simply too much of clownish buffoon in the scene where he escorts Washington to Congress to fast track passage of treaty, only to be rebuffed.  Patty Duke also brings some depth and originality to her portrayal as Martha.",1361318400,,1693,4.572847682119205

5360005,5,B009OE2O70,"In the George Washington Mini:Series You will find a fairly accurate visual picture of the life of George Washington, our founding father, his strengths, his weaknesses, his temptations, his integrity, his bravery. This is an action packed miniseries. One fault of the miniseries that I thought do a little more consideration is between the years 1764 and 1774 the series skip these years and included the action packed years. This series needed a historic commentary as a special feature by the historian whose book was used as an added bonus to comment on the differennces between the film and reality. I would still rate it a 5 star, the cast was outstanding. Bostwick did an outstanding job as the humble founding father just what the historian would picture.",1361059200,6,763,4.96875

Although it's a bit old, with production values that reflect its roots in 1980s TV, the history is reasonably accurate and the acting is quite good. Bostwick engagingly portrays Washington's quick temper and iron self-discipline, and shows a meaningful evolution of the character throughout his life.

Viewing it in 2014, it does not disappoint and remarkably, given so many books have been written about Washington since then, it is fairly true to who he was.  Anyone who read His Excellency, will enjoy this.  Barry Boswick's portrayal of George Washington improves after the first segment.

It is terrible to see all the personal betrayals that Washington endured, and the extent to which other general and (later) government officials surrounding him were more concerned about their own advancement and ideological agendas than the good of their fledgling nation. This film also movingly depicts Washington's struggle with slavery and realization that slavery is inconsistent with the principles upon which the US was founded. It shows his decisions to free his own slaves near the end of his life.",1417910400,,570,5.344444444444444
5360044,5,B009OE2O70,"This series brings to life our great President George Washington and the sacrifices he made to make us a free country.  It was interesting in that George Washington owned slaves, but as soon as his presidency ended, he made them legally friend, gave them money to start a new life. Some of the slaves decided to remain on his estate, because they loved George Washington. He made them wages. The only reason for not setting the salves free earlier was that Virginia was a powerful colony which was big on slavery. There was fear that setting the slaves free earlier would provoke Virginia from leaving the 13 colonies and this would threaten the war for Independence. Buy this for your children, grandchildren, or yourself. Our children are no longer taught the truth about history and our great country. We need to be informed if we want to keep our freedom.",1417046400,2,859,4.726666666666667

Finally after some time it has. It is about as good a biographical film as any documentary, except better because of the acting. For me there was one drawback and that is that it is not closed captioned in any form. As I watch most dvd's at night while my wife sleeps, this is almost imperative for me. I think Amazon should do a better job in reporting which films are closed captioned as there are a great many people with hearing problems and for them a film like this would be a waste of time.",1413072000,,647,4.142857142857143

5360062,5,B009OE2O70,"At last the day has come.  The best production of my generation is finally on DVD.  (I am 53 at the time of this writing).  My wife and I, watching the decline of high quality entertainment and learning experiences through entertainment media, have carefully selected the best movies, miniseries, documentaries, TV series, etc. that we could find.  This DVD set has both parts of the miniseries.  I received them in the mail today and have not verified that the entire miniseries is on this DVD set, unabridged.  I will report back here when I check them out.  But as far as whether to buy these or not, take some free advice and invest in these, and a backup copy or three.  You will not be disappointed.  This miniseries in by far the best that there is.  My children were glued to it at a very young age and continue to be to this day.
1. It was shot to fit a TV screen.  Set you player to full screen, not wide screen.
2. Start by going to chapter 1 on the DVD and play it from there, not ""play all.""  I understand that there is a difference from other reviews.
3. I am AMAZED at the quality of the picture.  The sound is OK.  I think that the tapes sound better for some reason.  But it would not be noticeable to anyone else.
My rating is 5 out of 5 for this miniseries.  Maybe there should be a level 6.  It is that good.  The viewer will appreciate George Washington far more by watching this set than any other out there.",1404864000,,1430,4.214022140221402
5360063,5,B009OE2O70,"I recently came across this mini-series on Amazon. Based upon the previous reviews it had received, I decided to give it a chance.  I have long been a student of George Washington and have great admiration for both the man as well as his pivotal and crucial role in the creation of our nation.  I can honestly and unequivocally say that this set was even better than I expected.  This production was terrific!  I found the casting to be excellent, the acting to be superb, and the writing to be both historically accurate as well as entertaining.

As an author of historical fiction myself (Meetings with Jake and Joe is my debut novel and the main character Henry is a HUGE George Washington fan), I have great admiration for how the creators/writers handled the non-fiction aspects of this telling while sprinkling in enough of the flavor of the day to allow the viewer to get a sense of what life at the time was like.  The use of known speeches and actual words of George Washington in the dialogue was a very nice touch as well. It all comes together with a brilliant performance by Barry Bostwick who literally transforms himself into Washington.  Taken as a whole, it is a wonderfully entertaining and educational series that I will enjoy again and again in years to come.  I highly recommend it!!",1404691200,,1304,4.639130434782609
5360064,5,B009OE2O70,"I received my copy of ""George Washington"" the mini series on 3 July 2014. I was so happy to see that it was finally on DVD. I hadn't checked in quite a while and there it was. I started reading the reviews and hoped that I would get the complete series. I didn't. The run time, according to the back of the package was, for parts 1 & 2, 480 minutes or 8 hours, I ran the entire two disks and it ran from 12 noon till 5 PM, that's 300 minutes. There's something rotten in Denmark. I noticed that parts that were missing were Henry Knox bringing the cannons over rough terrain to George Washington, The death of Martha Washington's daughter, Patsy, Will and Sally's picnic with George and Martha, Will Faifax's decision to go to England and not fight for independence and the selling of a slave who was married to a slave who was not being sold with her and the firing of the estate manager. All these things were missing and that 's just off the top of my head from what I remembered. I am so thankful for those reviewers who posted the phone number of TGG direct and I intend to call them on Monday after the holiday week-end. I also sent for, before I saw what was missing, another copy for my daughter who also loved the series. We'll see how that works out. It's already been shipped. I can't believe that they missed this. I was confused about how many stars to give this. I took one off for the missing part. The color is great and the sound was also very good. Like another reviewer I think it would have been nice to have sub-titles and I might add some comentary from some of the stars of the series. But right now I would be happy with a complete series. I'll let you know how I make out with TGG Direct. Isn't posting the wrong times against the law, like the contents of food packages?

Update: As stated above, I ordered a second copy of ""George Washington"" for my daughter. I didn't ask for or pay for overnight delivery, but it was delivered this morning (Sunday) at 7:15 AM by the post office. I don't know why, but that's not the gist of what I want to say. I decided to open up the new one and see if the same problem existed. So instead of hitting ""play all"" at the beginning I went to either chapter 3 or 4, and the rest of the series was there. I won't go into all I did, but when I did hit ""play all"" on the first one I got, it played for two and a half hours and went to the credits, so I figured that was it for the first disk and stopped it. I have found out that after you hit play all, half way through, it stops, runs the credits and immediately starts again with all the parts I thought were missing. I don't know why they did this, but I'm so happy that I don't have to call the company and ask for a replacement. It's all there. The run times on the packages are still wrong, but as long as I have the full series, I am one happy history buff. God bless George Washington. PS I have changed from four to five stars.",1404518400,8,2945,4.103986135181976

5360067,1,B009OE2O70,"The George Washington miniseries is one of the best programs ever made for television.  Every American should see this.  Bostwick's portrayal brings the man to life and is very moving in places.  You see the honor, courage, dignity, self-restraint, and vision of perhaps our greatest president.  And yes, he did truly love Sally Fairfax as evidenced by his personal letters to her; but he possessed the aforementioned qualities (unlike some of his successors) to refrain from acting on it.  Unfortunately, TGG Direct messed up in that this series should consist of 5 DVDs, instead of 3.  I ordered this twice from Amazon and each time received one box containing Disc 1 and Disc 2 of Part 1 and a second box containing Disc 3 of Part 2.  Discs 1 and 2 of Part 2 were both missing.

This series, starring Barry Bostwick was well done, and Mr. Bostwick acquitted himself nicely as General/President Washington. He was believable from his portrayal of Washington's days as an eager, energetic young man, through the mature Washington at the conclusion of his dual presidential terms.......The only omission has to do with George's teeth, which he actually lost early in his life, being reduced to ill fitting false teeth for most of his life. Barry has great teeth in the series, and never once is indicated as having discomfort or awkwardness in wearing false teeth.

5360072,5,B009OE2O70,"As an historian of the American Revolution, I'm happy to say that this series is quite historically accurate.  It is visually appealing, has a good balance of action scenes vs.dialogue scenes, and does keep events moving.  Too much time was spent, however, on the supposed romantic feelings between Washington and Sally Fairfax.  But that's to be expected of Hollywood.  I would especially recommend the series to high school students.  Barry Bostwick did a good job showing that our founding fathers are not just words from some history book, but real flesh and blood people.",1395100800,3,576,5.085106382978723
5360073,5,B009OE2O70,"I first saw this when it aired back in 1984 (I think). While all such shows take some liberties, and leave things out, this one did a good job of bringing the principle players and events to life. The first series took us from Washington's teenage years and his first job as an apprentice surveyor (with a tip of the hat to his childhood and his love for his half-brother Lawrence) through his days as a colonial major and then colonel, his growing anger over his treatment by British 'regular' officers as a second-class citizen and finally his becoming ""The Great Man"" as commanding general of the rebel army, including the problems of keeping that army supplied and fighting not only the British but a powerless and sometimes recalcitrant Congress at home. In between it portrays his love for his best friend's wife and his courtship with Virginia's wealthiest widow, and his ultimate love for her and her two children. The show portrays the people around him, notably Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette. It shows his struggles with other men who think they could do a better job and spend all their time trying to undermine his authority, and wraps up with his farewell address to the army and final retirement, or so he thinks.

But that's not all. The 1985 sequel is also included in this set, with two lengthy episodes examining his eight years as the first President of the United States. His struggles with encroaching age and the frailties involved, his struggles with the dichotomy of being a champion of freedom while still owning slaves, the growing hostility between his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, and Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, are all adequately portrayed.

It doesn't have the gritty realism of the more recent John Adams series, and both film and music styles are firmly set in the early '80s, this piece of historical drama is still up there with the best, and well worth watching whether you are familiar with the material or not. It's still one of my all-time favorites.",1394928000,4,2035,4.828080229226361
5360074,5,B009OE2O70,"I had been hesitating to buy this set because so many buyers had complained that it was incomplete - that major sections of PART ONE were missing.  I finally ordered the set at the beginning of March 2014 and received it today 3/08.  There is one cover sleeve and two DVD cases, total 3 DVDs.  The DVD jacket cover is Barry Bostwick in profile close-up as President Washington in the white powdered wig.  PARTS ONE and TWO are both included in this one package for under $20.

The running times match the VHS that was issued years ago.  The DVD picture quality is much higher.

PART ONE  - Disc One  = 4:07:29 . . . Disc Two  = 2:27:38
TOTAL 395 Minutes  (6 hours, 35 minutes)

PART TWO - Disc Three = 3:16:38
TOTAL 196 Minutes (3 hours, 16 minutes)

This is an excellent program. It is well researched and well-written and should be seen by every American.  Without Washington, there would be no United States of America.

The casting is impeccable - especially with Barry Bostwick as George Washington.  His face, his countenance, his height and build and his characterization of the great man could not be better.  Patty Duke is also excellent as Martha Custis Washington.  All the casting is superb and could not be matched today with the current pool of American and English actors available.

Suitable for ages 16 and up.  Younger children will not be able to follow much of it.  Even adults require a reasonable knowledge of American history in the colonial period to fully understand what's going on.",1394236800,12,1508,4.615094339622641

The actual times when I played the disks are 394 & 197 minutes ... the difference being commercial breaks (8 nights at 60 minutes per night is 480 minutes ... 4 nights at 60 minutes per night is 240).  These actual running times (394 & 197) are about the same as the VHS running times ... which I have.  This means that all of the programs content is there!!!!

This is confusing enough ... yet the confusion is complicated by the fact that a version of the DVD set was released that was in fact missing content (it may be the red box)

So check your running times and make sure you have all of this wonderful mini-series! Buying from Amazon direct should help enure this ... but check anyways. This a very special ... in-depth .. telling of GW's life ... which is something that all American should understand. He was magnificent!

Like many others I was capivated when this mini series was on TV.  I have a copy of it on VHS tape.  I still have a player to play the tapes, but have been nervous for fear they will break from age.  I was thrilled to see this listed FINALLY as a DVD set.  I read the reviews on Amazon before ordering on Nov 21 2013 and crossed my fingers that the missing parts some reviews mentioned would now be included.  Tonight, Nov 28 was our night to watch this.  It was as good as I remember, Barry Bostwick does a fabulous job portraying George Washington and I remember him speaking about how honored he felt at the time playing the role, it shows, IMO, in his performance.  It is still good! For that reason, FIVE STARS, worth the money, worth the time spent watching.  ONE STAR... after all this time, the missing sections ARE NOT included, at least in the copy I received.  This is a Two Part Mini series, done in 1984 and part 2 done in 1986.  Problems are with the 1984 portion which is split into two discs.  The first disc is ""Chapter"" 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, the second disc is ""Chapter 6, 7 and 8.  The back of the DVD case states the 1984 miniseries run time is 480 minutes,  What we watched on these 2 discs tonight ran just over 5 hours.  The first disc ran under 3 hours, the second ran about 2-1/2 hours.  It is fine until the French and Indian War ends, George goes home, marries Martha and they move to Mt Vernon from where he attends a meeting of the House of Burgess.  The next thing you see is him sitting with his Officiers in camp during the Revolutionary War.  BIG JUMP!  Again, this is SO worthwhile to watch for the content and the performances.  WHY WHY WHY can't someone get it together and allow us to own and watch the entire thing!  If you loved the miniseries, for the price, buy this and enjoy it even with the missing sections.  It is sad tho that someone (MGM is listed) is making money on this incomplete version when there are many of us who would be thrilled to own the entire thing and at least for me, would be willing to be a bit more to have it in its entirety.  Also interesting that this DVD portrays George Washington as a man of intregrity and honor who puts doing the right thing ahead of all else.... wish those in control of the film to DVD reproduction would exhibit some of the same and make this right. , Hope this info is helpful to others.",1385596800,9,2511,4.183333333333334

5360084,5,B009OE2O70,"I discovered this mini-series after returning from visiting Mount Vernon and looking up George Washington related items on Amazon. I initially held off on my purchase until I could confirm that the earlier version glitches were resolved. I found that the scenes previous reviewers described as missing (1765 to 1775) are in the version I received. I also believe the original run times included commercials. My set Part I clocked in at 396 minutes and Part II at 197 minutes.
Now for the series itself. One of the best I've seen! Most video releases out there are documentaries about GW and not much in the way of a movie/series. I found this series very entertaining and informative. Both the ups and downs of his life are presented. Much of GW's life is captured here, but I found the parts about the Revolutionary War and his presidency the most fascinating. Barry Bostwick's portrayal was excellent. I thought he did a great job. I also found Patty Duke's portrayal of Mrs. GW very well done.
I highly recommend this set. A great story of GW and the founding of this great nation (as related to GW). I hope someday we may see some more mini-series of the founding of our country and the major players (like HBO's John Adams).",1382227200,4,1229,4.668202764976958

Most of the storyline follows history with the primary author's occasional interpretation of some events that might be questionable.  Most events, however, are depicted well.  Beyond that, the series gives the viewer a window into the early life of Washington as well as his struggles through the colonial upheaval with Great Britain that eventually led to our nation's independence and his appointment as Commander-in-chief of the Continental Army.  Relationships are revealed as they occurred in history.  Washington's development as a man and a soldier is presented in a way that is easy to follow and understand.  From his first fox hunt with the Fairfaxes to his tearful resignation as Commander-in-Chief at the conclusion of the revolution, walking away from power that could easily have been his, one can truly understand why Washington was the young nation's first and unanimous choice for first president.",1381968000,3,994,5.2993630573248405

I do think that the Valley Forge wintry conditions were lacking, as was the contrived battle scenes against the Hessians at Trenton, NJ. I  watched this series when it was first aired on TV. Seeing it today I can almost detect each commercial break. It has a feel of being done in such segments. There were things of importance that were either omitted or only glanced at. I certainly would have emphasized more the treachery of Benedict Arnold! Why they never apprehended him. This was a personal betrayal of Washington. I really think they had needed to show the scope of his treason against the US, but a total betrayal of Washington's friendship and dedication to him.

5360090,5,B009OE2O70,"Two terrific mini-series--now complete--that every American should view at least once. The videos will give you a new appreciation for this truly great man to whom we and the world owe so much. A man so many take for granted.

The mini-series show much you have never heard about President Washington. You will watch him grow from a complex, sometimes clumsy and brash youth, into ""Washington: The Indispensable Man""--an accolade applied by biographer James Thomas Flexner. Along the way, the series brings to life many of the hardships, tragedies, and self-doubts Washington suffered before, during, and after the Revolution. The video also graphically, and tastefully, portrays the suffering of the soldiers under General Washington during the Revolution.

Prepare to see Washington ""warts and all"" from childhood to his death. Despite the warts, Washington remains: ""First in war. First in peace. First in the hearts of his countrymen.""

Ever wonder why Presidents walk to their inauguration? Why presidents only go to Congress once per year unless invited? The included second installment, ""George Washington the Forging of a Nation"" will show you if you watch carefully.",1380758400,2,1175,5.375
5360091,5,B009OE2O70,"I have had a love of America's Colonial/Revolutionary history since seventh grade, so when the Washington mini-series was originally presented on TV, I loved it.  It was in two parts, a couple of years apart.  The first dealt with His Excellency's childhood (no, there was no cherry tree incident!) through the end of the Revolution.  The second part follows Washington's two terms as President.  I actively looked unsuccessfully for the series on VHS tape for years.  When they finally became available, I grabbed them.  I am thrilled that the series is now available on DVD.

This series is an abolute GEM!  Barry Bostwick and Patty Duke were excellent in their very human portrayals of George and Martha Washington.  I highly recommend this series for every American--from students to adults--in order to understand the tremendous debt owed to His Excelllency because of his integrity and the hardships our Army endured to win our freedoms.

5360110,1,B009OE2O70,"Just received it in the mail today and like other reviews I've read here, I also have a complaint about what I thought I was buying and what I actually received.  The Amazon description says the set includes five (5) discs that will run 480 minutes but I only received three (3) discs worth 240 minutes.  Wow!!!  What the hell happened here!?  I admit that I saw what Amazon had said about this being a problem purchase but I took a chance anyway.  Unfortunately the dice came up snake-eyes.  Read and heed all who would like to purchase this DVD set.",1370822400,4,551,4.405940594059406

I do think some parts have been cut out, it seemed like some of the battle scenes were missing and other parts as well. My VHS copy is extremely worn as we home schooled and got a lot of use out of our original. I would still recommend purchasing it for anyone who loves American history and see the sacrifices that were made for us to have the freedoms that we enjoy today.",1370736000,,502,3.98019801980198
5360112,1,B009OE2O70,"I was about to purchase George Washington miniseries, but if it's not the complete miniseries I don't want it. I'll wait until they release the full mini series!!! That's why I give it 1 star instead of 5. Why did they do this?",1370563200,5,227,4.3023255813953485
5360113,1,B009OE2O70,"I have the vhs tapes. Whoever made the dvd skipped the middle tape completely, covering the years between 1765 and late 1776.  This covered personal tragedy, the growing unrest and final break with England and the appointment of Washington as supreme commander. The cover shows a white-haired Washington in full profile.  In my opinion the dvd should be pulled until it is corrected.",1370390400,7,383,5.063492063492063

5360115,5,B009OE2O70,This has always been a favorite of mine telling the story of George Washington.  Barry Bostwick does a superb job portraying our General and first President of the United States.  It is well worth watching.,1369699200,,206,4.857142857142857
5360116,5,B009OE2O70,This an engaging tv movie about the life of George Washington.  It portrays him with his flaws...as all humans have them.  Very entertaining.,1368921600,,141,5.086956521739131

5360120,5,B009OE2O70,"I saw the original mini-series when it was first shown in the 1980s.  I was still in the Army at Fort Belvoir Virginia (where they filmed some of the battles scenes) at the time.  Some of my friends were actually in the movie.  General Washington is a personal hero of mine so I was excited to see his story finally put on TV.  Some people may be put off by the length of the series but that is one of the reasons I loved it as it covers virtually Washington's entire life from childhood to him leaving the Presidency.  It was filmed at all of the historic sites associated with Washington and the battle scenes are very accurate to the period.  You can almost smell the powder.
Barry Bostwick's portrayal is excellent and I think captures Washington's demeanor and character.  Highly recommened both for its entertainment and educational value.  GEORGE WASHINGTON the mini-series now has a honored and permanent place in my DVD collection.",1367280000,,940,4.689024390243903

5360122,5,B009OE2O70,"I had pre-ordered one months ago and it arrived and I saw an hour was edited from the 1984 mini-series, totaling 339 minutes. A friend of mine had recently bought it and told me his was 394 minutes, the correct time.  I never did get around to contacting TGG Direct (even though if I were to drive there, it would take me less than an hour LOL) so I thought I would take a chance and for $12.99, order another one here from Amazon.  As soon as I received it in the mail two days later I put it into my DVD player and recorded the time - 394 minutes! My MGM VHS releases from the '90s totalled 398 minutes, but there can be other factors for the four minute time difference like speed, etc. Anyway, I am VERY happy to now have BOTH the 1984 and 1986 mini-series' COMPLETE!!!  BTW, the time on the back of the DVD box is still incorrect. If it were correct, the first mini-series would be a full 8 hours and the second a full 4. When they originally aired on CBS they were those times, but of course those were with commercials!

I am not sure what TGG Direct did to rectify the situation - whether they got a different master from MGM or if someone was just asleep, I am just glad to see they fixed the problem!",1366761600,42,1210,4.114406779661017
5360123,3,B009OE2O70,"The Mini Series was edited down, cutting out the heart  the human side of George Washington as intended by the producers. The quality of the dvd was just ok, it needed to be remastered,  but thats no fault of the seller, arrived on time.",1366416000,7,237,4.363636363636363
5360124,5,B009OE2O70,"I have been reading some of the reviews on this. Some people are stating that they have received an edited version. I admit in 1984 when this was first shown on television, I was not in the country so I missed it. I did become aware of the series a few years later. One night, when I was sick and missed work and it was rebroadcast but I only saw one episode. However, I did not see the complete series until the mid 90's when either TLC or the History Channel showed it for the 4th of July. I collected the VHS tapes. I do not recall anything different between then and watching the DVD's just now.

What I saw on this was a very good mini-series about George Washington. What I received was the original "" George Washington,"" mini series and "" George Washington: Forging of a Nation.""  Of the two the first is the best, it deals with Washington's life from a young age until the end of the Revolutionary War. The second mini-series deals with Washington's time as president.

Both series are based on James Thomas Flexner's biography on Washington. I can only say if you love the Revolutionary War period of American history, buy the mini-series. It stays pretty close to Flexner's biography. It is also a good way to be introduced to George Washington. I remember when I was in grade school. Washington never excited me. Franklin or Revere was the interesting ones from the Revolution to me then. It was only as I became older did I really become really aware of Washington and just how important he truly was.

Note, if this DVD release is indeed missing portions return it but I think it is complete. I would also add read Flexner's books on Washington, if you can.",1366416000,,1670,4.465573770491804
5360125,5,B009OE2O70,I loved this Mini-Series.  It had a great story and was told in a new and interesting way.  i have watched it twice and will watch it again and again.,1365724800,,150,3.966666666666667
5360126,5,B009OE2O70,In my opinion this is a first class look into the life of George Washington and life in the coloneys. Well worth the price and the time spent watching.,1365120000,,151,4.241379310344827
5360127,5,B009OE2O70,"What a wonderful Mini Series. I read the books by Mr. Flexner, and they sure followed what he wrote. I was so pleased to see. that.",1363564800,,131,4.076923076923077
5360128,5,B009OE2O70,"This DVD set contains BOTH movies, ""George Washington"" AND ""George Washington: Forging of a Nation"" that were aired back in 1984 and 1986 respectively.

These movies were so good, that I had this on VHS (3 tapes each movie), and really wanted this on DVD so I could watch this more easily, since I have sort of forgotten how to use my VCR...

The cast in both movies are stellar, so you will not be disappointed.

WIll update review later, after I have watched them!",1363478400,,466,4.458823529411765
5360129,5,B009OE2O70,"A wonderful series about the 'father"" of our country and first Amercian President. The series begins with Washinton as a boy, his relationship to his older half brother Laurence and his mother and continues with him as a young man moving among the colonial society of VA. It continues with his military experiences in the French and Indian War, and his wedding to Martha Park Custice. He is then swept up in the conflict with Great Britian and becomes commander of the Continental army. The mini series shows his trials and tribulations as commander and concludes with his victory at Yorktown. Washington further shows his statesmanship by encouraging is officers not to rebel against the Continental congress. In the second series, Washington becomes the first President of the newly formed United States a new Federal Union. Faced with challenges both domestic and foreign, Washington charts the country in the direction of domestic tranquility and peace abroad. The seed of Civil War are also dispayed, the issue of States rights vs Federal power and the issue of slavery. It is a wonderful mini series, highly recomended.",1362873600,,1125,5.0864864864864865
5360130,2,B009OE2O70,"Plays well, but I guess you get what you pay for, edited version of a very good mini series. Barry Bostwick does a great job portrarying the great George Washington. I just can't figure out why it wasn't released in it's entireity on DVD.",1362441600,5,238,4.431818181818182
5360131,5,B009OE2O70,"I have waited years for this to be released as a DVD. Any lover of American History will love this mini series which debuted @ 1985.
Barry Bostwick is outstanding in his portrayal of the great man. It is overall historically accurate, even though Hollywood throws in some tiny curves. I had used this for years to supplement my lessons on the Revolutionary War. The students got a taste of what Washington was all about. Based on Flexner's books Washington comes to life on screen. His ambition as a youth, and his integrity as an adult are displayed prominently through out the series. A must for history buffs.",1362355200,,612,4.675925925925926
5360132,5,B009OE2O70,"The George Washington mini-series was was shown in three parts, over three nights. This set has the complete first and third parts, but the second part is missing a full half of the original broadcast. I have the original tapes. TGG Direct screwed-up badly on this one. I wonder if this company will do as poorly on all of their products.

The second mini-series included here, 'Forging of a Nation', is complete.

UPDATE - May 2013

I can now give this an unqualified 5 stars.

I went back to see the reviews on this and found that TGG Direct has added the missing segment. The entire series is now complete.

As others have written, this is an outstanding mini-series.",1362182400,93,670,4.5966386554621845

Obviously I am a bit of a Washington Groupie and always have been so I may be biased, but I also have a History/Education degree and I find this series to be a great aide that can capture and inspire young minds with his story! Washington in reality had his faults and shortcomings, but this story certainly does not sugar coat his life and is a rousing tale!",1362009600,,429,4.180722891566265

8543375,1,B009OE2O70,"Without a doubt this is one of the very best mini series ever to grace the television screen. So it is particularly frustrating that there are STILL difficulties in obtaining the complete and UNabridged version from Amazon. Many other reviewers have stated in the past that they had not received the full length version but a very much shorter one. After some time however it seemed that the problem had been resolved. I was delighted to find that the entire series was finally available and I made certain to place my order for the version that was copyrighted in 2016, as that was the corrected version. What I actually received was the (very) short version, copyrighted 2012/13!

Amazingly enough, in my search online for a different source to purchase from other than Amazon, I discovered that the entire series is available on Youtube. Admittedly the quality is much poorer than the DVD version since the Youtube version was made from the VHS tapes. But I was very grateful for the enormous amount of time it must have taken to post it and also delighted that I could at least get to see the full series. The original series starts with Washington as a young boy and progresses through his late teen and early adult years. This is all included in the Youtube version.

For reference, I stopped watching almost two hours into the show and still had not come to the place where the Amazon version started! That should give you some idea as to just how severely this series has been 'edited'. Throughout the entire series as well, large chunks of the story are missing. What you end up with is pretty much a ""George Washington for Dummies"" -- or people in a hurry. And that is a real disservice to the cast and crew of this wonderful glimpse into our nation's history.

At present I am returning my short version to Amazon in hopes that my complaints will persuade them to send me the complete and unabridged series (which runs for nearly ten hours.) I will update this review when and if I am successful in my attempt. If not, I will make more noise!  : )",1489449600,,2058,4.569105691056911

YES, I DID OPEN MY 3RD SET OF 3 DISCS - AND IN EACH PLASTIC BOX, INSIDE OF THE SAME KIND OF BOX, THERE ARE THE OTHER TWO DISCS.  AND THEY ALL WORK FINE ON THE.  SO IT IS HARD TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING...

ALSO, SOME OTHER THINGS I DISCOVERED WERE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTING IN THESE MOVIES - WHEN I LOOK AT THE BACK PART OF THE HARD PLASTICBOX. THEN READ WHAT IT SAYS.  ESPECIALLY ABOUT HOW THEY MADE THESE HARD PLASTIC BOXES.  ON MINE, IT IS MADE WITH MOSTLY OLDER ACTORS THAT I RECOGNIZED FROM THOSE TV SHOWS - AND MOST OF THEM ARE ACTORS THAT WERE IN MANY OF THE TELEVISION SHOWS THAT AIRED IN THE 1970' AND 1980.  IT ALSO SAYS THAT IT WAS MADE IN 1984, IN THE ""MGM"", OR THEIR FULL NAME -  ""METRO-GOLDWN-MAYER - IN THEIR STUDIOS AND SOMETIMES IN AND VARIOUS OTHER LOCATIONS.

FINALLY, YESTERDAY I OPENED MY HARD PLASTIC BOX, AND PLAYED THE FIRST DISC, OUT OF THE THREE - SOMEWHERE IT SAYS THAT: ""THESE MOVIES WERE MADE BECAUSE OF THE BOOKS THAT SOMEONE MADE LONG AGO.  OUT OF ALL OF THESE THIS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE ON FILM.  I HOPE THIS HELPS.

I DID GET THE 3 DISC, BLACK PLASTIC BOX OPENED, AND A VERY WELL MADE CASES THAT WORK VERY WELL.  THEN, WHEN THE SHOW STARTED, AND I WAS SEEING THESE LITTLE KIDS PLAYING ""SOLDERER,"" AND I WAS OK ABOUT THAT.  THEN AS THE NEXT DISC STARTED, G. WASHINGTON WAS LEARNING HOW TO BE A SHOULDER. (IT'S ALMOST A MONTH AGO THAT I WATCHED THIS, SO PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH ME.)

THEN, WHEN GEORGE W. BECOMES AN ADULT, THAT'S WHEN I SAW PATTY DUKE AGAIN.  I HAD SEEN SOME OF HER ACTING BEFORE, BUT THE PART THAT CAUSED ME TO FEEL CONFUSED WAS TO SEE THIS 6'6"" HUGE MAN, (G.WASHINGTON), STANDING NEXT TO HIS NEW WIFE AND MOTHER, AT: ""5'. MRS. WASHINGTON.  I KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN EVERY DAY, BUT WHEN THE CASTING PERSON IN HOLLYWOOD, CA PICKS: ""MRS WASHINGTON,"" WHY DID THEY DO THAT?

NOW I HOPE TO WATCH THE 2ND DISC IN THE FIRST SET OF THE 3RD.
