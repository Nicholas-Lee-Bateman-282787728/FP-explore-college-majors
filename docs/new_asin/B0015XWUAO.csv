8260373,5,B0015XWUAO,My daughters watch this dvd over and over and over!!! It is so cute and comical and it have good lessons for the kids. I recommend it to anyone! I can wait to get more DVDs from Loopdidoo!,1223424000,,188,3.973684210526316
8260374,5,B0015XWUAO,"This cartoon was part of Voom's lineup on Anamania HD.  Then Dish Network dropped Voom Network >( and my son was heartbroken that he'd never see Loopdidoo, Pet Alien, and especially Yuri the Spaceman ever again. So being able to find this on dvd is just too neat for us.  This cartoon has wonderful story lines and very clean animation that looks great in HD, or even with an upconvert dvd player.",1218672000,3,397,4.5
8260375,4,B0015XWUAO,My son is one and he loves this movie. He is not to big on alot of different cartoons but this one caught his attention. If fell in love with it the first time he watched it.,1217980800,,174,3.72972972972973
8260376,2,B0015XWUAO,"It seems cute enough and I thought it was good.
Although, it really is not keeping my 4 year old
daughter's attention. She gets bored with it really
very quickly! ...and that's usually not the case with
many other dvd's she watches. So, I really wish
I hadn't purchased this one.",1217721600,,279,4.490196078431373
8260377,4,B0015XWUAO,"My son is 5 1/2 yrs old.  This is his all time favorite DVD.  If I would let him, he would watch it over and over dusk till dawn. My son has autism and the words are easy for him to understand.  The music is upbeat, the stories are broken down into short stories that he can follow easily and the colors are bright and cheerful to capture his attention.
My son prefers cats where animals are concerned so the cat (or at least I think it's a cat)in Loopdidoo is not only his favorite animal but in his favorite color...PURPLE.  Even the fleas in the movie are cute.  Petunia, the lil' girl, is 5 years old and my son likes watching another 5-year old on t.v..  I would give this a 5-star rating except ""Bear In The Big Blue House"" is a 5-star in our house.",1217289600,,755,4.1020408163265305
