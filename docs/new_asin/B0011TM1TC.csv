8431372,1,B0011TM1TC,Designed for Europeans coming to US to tour.  I picked this for my husband who has dementia and Lake Powell is his all time favorite place to be.  There was not much to the DVD that was specific and way to much film of the water off the back of a boat.  A true disappointment.,1421366400,,276,3.981818181818182
8431373,1,B0011TM1TC,"This DVD is a waste of money don't buy it.  It is basically someone's vacation video taken from a tour boat coupled with a silly voice over with useless information about Lake Powell (and lame music to boot).  There is no helpful information about which canyon's to go to, which hikes are best, where to camp, what to see, etc.",1250208000,,327,4.433333333333334
