7902833,4,B000003K94,"Now that Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) is back at DS instead of the Changeling that had taken his place, he is approached with an interesting offer from Starfleet.  ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" Episode 114, ""Doctor Bashir, I Presume?"" (Story by Jimmy Diggs, Teleplay by Ronald D. Moore, Aired February 24, 1997), has Dr. Lewis Zimmerman (Robert Picardo) arriving at the station and informing Bashir that he has been chosen as the model for the new version of Starfleet's Emergency Medical Hologram (it seems the crew of ""Voyager"" are not the only ones who noticed that the EMG is not exactly user friendly).  This means that Zimmerman has to learn everything he can about Bashir, from interpersonal relationships to what his childhood was like.  The latter is what turns to be the rub, because this means interviewing Bashir's co-workers, friends, and family.  But Bashir pointedly asked Zimmerman not to talk to his parents.  Of course, the next day Bashir's parents, Richard (Brian George) and Amsha (Fadwa El Guindi), arrive at DS9 and the doctor goes through the nearest roof.
Despite its comic premise and title, ""Doctor Bashir, I Presume?"" takes a very serious turn as we learn there is a secret about Bashir that could destroy his career that really comes out of left field, except for how it explains Bashir's status as a medical wunderkind.  This makes for an interesting change of pace, because when this episode started I was thinking about them doing this same basic story line with Dr. McCoy or Beverly Crusher (why not, right?  Just think of what Bones would have to say about this whole process).  But then this episode abandons all notions of comedy and heads for the dark side.
For a long time I was not sure what the point of revealing Bashir's deep dark secret was in the context of the series, but it seems to me that there is a notion of introducing what prejudice is like in the idealistic ""Star Trek"" universe and to have a moment where the other DS9 crew members look at Bashir with truly different eyes.  Ultimately the payoff here is something that could have been better set up in earlier episodes, with a tantalizing tidbit dropped here and there throughout the previous couple of seasons, but that would have required this idea to have been out there before Season Five, and I do not think that was the case.  An interesting episode, but one that does serve as the springboard to much down the road.",1073347200,2,2432,4.755344418052257
7902834,4,B000003K94,"Dr. Lewis Zimmerman arrives on Deep Space Nine in an attempt to convince Julian Bashir that he would make the perfect model for his new emergency  medical hologram (EMH) but to make a more accurate, friendly and efficient  doctor Zimmerman needs to take an in-depth look at Julian's background,  including his parents.
But Bashir has a secret, a HUGE secret that will  put his very career in danger. A good episode that features Bashir's  parents for the first time and obviously marks the guest appearance of  Robert Picardo of Voyager fame.",966729600,5,542,4.9010989010989015
