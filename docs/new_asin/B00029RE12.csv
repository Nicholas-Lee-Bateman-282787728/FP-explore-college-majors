2072286,5,B00029RE12,I have been an avid fan of this show for years. It would be wonderful to have the complete set on DVD. I have been watching the reruns on Discovery Channel and the final episode aired last night (6/27/06). Please someone @ Discovery Channel if you are reading this - put the show on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1151452800,6,303,4.527272727272727
2072287,5,B00029RE12,"I am an adult with no children who loves this shop.  It's reminds me of the early X-Files before that show revolved around Scully and her baby obsession.  There is a strong ethical/moral component mixed with some valid science and interesting story lines.  The scripts are well written; one does not know the exact words a character will say before he/she says them and, for a young cast, the acting is solid.  I would highly recommend it to anybody with or without  kids.

PLEASE, powers that be at Discovery, make the whole series available on DVD.",1149379200,28,550,4.677083333333333
2072288,5,B00029RE12,"I am an adult with two young kids, but I love this show!  It is funny, cool and very interesting.  I love how science is mixed in with the fascinating story lines.  The characters are well written and you just fall in love with them!  I recommend this show to anyone who is a kid a heart.  I can't wait for it to be on DVD, I will definitely buy it.  Until then, I just keep watching the reruns on Discovery Kids!",1144713600,10,413,3.975609756097561
2072289,5,B00029RE12,"Discovery Kids broadcasted 3 seasons of this show followed by a 3 movie finale. This is an educational-adventure show about a  boarding school with a jaded past of scientific experiements that opened a wormhole. Now comes Josie...a tough 15 yr old who has a problem with authority. She meets with a group of friends and the strange events start to begin. This show contains it all, time travel, medical/scientific experiments, and more. My favorite episode is the ""Tesseract"" where rooms in the school transfer you to different places in time. Anyone who liked the show is looking forward to this DVD.",1143590400,12,601,4.9504950495049505
