6447911,4,B00KU3Y5FI,"I reviewed this set before, but I thought I'd take another look at this set, after doing some research.

First of all, I'm not here to review the show.  The show is awesome.  If you're looking at reviews of the Limited Edition then chances are you're already a fan of the show.

I did some research and I found out that this version isn't really the ""ultimate"" version of this set.  There's an edition of this that comes with an Ender box.  The LEs are designed to fit inside the box (box only holds part 1+2).  The box really completes the set in my opinion, although the box art contains a spoiler on one of the sides for some reason.  Please note that this edition does NOT come with the box.  This is just the LE book.

The LE is in a hardcover book format, which is thick and sturdy.  The discs are housed in plastic trays (attached to the inner covers of the book) have a crescent shaped release button (not my favorite, but not terrible) and are stored in an overlapping style.

A 22 page booklet containing interviews, character + titan bios, and some short comics is built into the spine.  The booklet is great but I wish they would have had it be separate from the disc packaging.

The LE also comes with a holographic pencil board of the same art used on the cover of this volume.

The discs themselves are pretty barebones, just a chapter select and audio/subtitle selection.

My only gripes about this set are the built-in booklet and the fact that they use spoilers on both the cover art and the box art.",1417737600,3,1518,4.367857142857143
6447912,5,B00KU3Y5FI,"This is one of the best anime series to own. great plot, good voice cast, and a lot of action.",1417651200,,94,3.75
6447913,4,B00KU3Y5FI,"Fantastic series and great edition, but it's a very bad idea to have included the booklet (which has good content) directly in the digipack. It make the booklet hard to read and makes the digipack more fragile.",1417392000,,210,4.702702702702703
6447924,5,B00KU3Y5FI,"The pricing for Attack on Titan Part 2 Limited Edition w/BOX is perfect when it comes to the Black Friday deal of 50% off bringing it around $53.50 even with tax. Before it could have cost you around $95.00. What a Black Friday deal on anime from Amazon.com.

I loved this anime series so much. My excitement first began with the PV that first hit via Youtube. I could tell even then it was going to make such an uproar. I mean the movement in animation was extraordinary when it came to scenes of the characters using 3D Maneuver Gear.

Even so, Attack on Titan, has such heavy suspense value and strong character development especially given the graphic story premise of the Attack on Titan storyline.

Yuki Kaji also shines in his role as Eren Jaeger the most. He instills such a mental fury in the lead character of the series that an audience likely will be moved by it. Other characters that have a sense of power and emotion will be Yui Ishikawa. Next will be somewhat of almost better known character Captain Levi voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya. If you are not aware of Hiroshi Kamiya's voice acting then please be aware he is an excellent voice actor and most of the time many of the anime he has starred in be it as lead or supporting character have also been excellent. Yes, Attack on Titan, also contains talented voice acting.

While I am sure other reviewers have stated the same. Attack on Titan does tend to be highly regarded by many but just because of that high praise does it just mean it is overrated. It is not. It is only that it tends to be very accessible across a few different cultures. Making it have a wide fanbase. Despite that there will, of course, be those who might still not find it to their taste but its still worth a look if you want to see a mature struggle for survival anime series for the most part and high production values when it comes to animation.",1417219200,2,1889,4.404011461318052

6447930,5,B00KU3Y5FI,"I bought this exact thing off rightstuf for $59.99 with the bluray box and so to see this price on amazon is ridiculous. The box is basically just cardboard that's been laminated with the picture and although it feels and looks nice, it's not worth the increase of $30. The going price for the limited edition without the box on rightstuf is about $53 and the increase of $6 for the box is reasonable, but not this scam. I guess being one of the only places offering this deal that's not out of stock would explain this outrage. You'll really have to ask yourself how much of a fan you are and whether a cardboard box is worth $30. I would just recommend buying the limited edition alone and saving the $30 to spend on something else because to me unless this box was encrusted with some sort of jewel and had gold lining the borders it's a rip off.",1412035200,4,849,4.3125
6447931,5,B00KU3Y5FI,"Attack on Titans:

I first saw this anime with subs, last year (2013), and I was surprised by how good it was! When I first heard of Attack on Titan, I was expecting the greek titans jeje I was wrong with that, The titans are more human like, with the thirst for blood, they will eat anyone who gets in their way (or at least most of them will). The anime can get very intense at times with top notch action scenes! It does get a little slow in some episodes, but it was nothing that made me want to stop watching it. The Japanese voice acting is really good, and while the dub is not as good as the subs, it's still good, for those who prefer the dubbed versions. The animation is different from what I have seen before, the characters outlines are thicker than most anime, but I really like that. Character development is not great, but still good, with the main character (Eren) being sorta 1 dimensional... The anime can be really gory and brutal at times, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids... Overall, it's a good anime, plot and story are done well, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action/adventure anime.

Part 2 Limited edition+ Artbox:

Part 2 limited edition is pretty much build the same as part 1, with different pictures, interviews, information on titans and such. The artbox holds both parts, Limited edition Part 1 and part 2 and they both fit perfectly in it. The box is made of cardboard (like a lot artboxes), but it's sturdy, so you don't have to worry about it bending easily. On the spine and top, it only has the name of the anime, and in the back it has the face on a titan. I recommend buying this edition ONLY if you're a big fan of this anime and or like collecting limited editions and such. Between part 1 and 2 limited edition, it would cost you well over $100 bucks, which is not really worth it, if you just like it, and want to own it. For you guys, I recommend the regular edition which goes for about $60 bucks for both parts.

I will upload some images so you could checked out, if you guys want to see how it looks.",1411689600,57,2073,4.267175572519084
6447932,4,B00KU3Y5FI,"I ordered the limited edition, which was supposed to come with a box that you could put BOTH part one and two with, but I didn't get it. I'm fine with what I got and it still is the limited edition with all the bonus material, but I didn't get what I paid for overall....????",1411430400,,275,4.0181818181818185
6447933,5,B00KU3Y5FI,"Not an anime otaku, but I found myself completely drawn into this series--I consumed each episode as it became available, and I can't wait for the next season. The technical aspects are spot on, and there's a hefty dose of strategy integrated into the story. If there are any drawbacks, I'd have to say some of the characters are unnecessarily clueless, which only seems to drag revelations out longer than needed. It's a minor observation, and not enough to warrant taking a star off the review.

By far one of the more ""adult"" titles to hit in quite some time. [""Adult"" meaning the intensity of the story, not because of sex/drugs/rock and/or roll.]",1411430400,3,651,4.761061946902655
