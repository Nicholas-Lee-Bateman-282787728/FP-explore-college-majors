Go read Bryan Magee, Barry Millington, Martin Gregor-Dellin, Paul Dawson-Bolling, Thomas Grey, Nicholas Vaszonyi, Stewart Spencer, etc. to find out the true greatness of the man and of his genius.  Wagner can do nothing good for Greenberg, ever...  This is the tabloid version of his life and biographical reductionism of his music and dramas.  No one has ever accused Wagner of being mad, and the blatant mistakes in interpreting his dramas that this ""lecturer"" makes are gross and simplistic and ludicrously one sided.  These ""lectures"" have an agenda and it is not truth or fairness to Wagner.  I always wonder why people like this man (or the late Robert Gutman who wrote the worst bio of Wagner) are so compulsively determined to attack Wagner...  Maybe Freud or any garden variety psychiatrist knows?",1465430400,18,978,5.1069182389937104
