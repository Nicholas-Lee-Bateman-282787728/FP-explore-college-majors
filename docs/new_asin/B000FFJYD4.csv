8121673,5,B000FFJYD4,"Had to give it five stars!  My kid is in the movie, well, listed in the credits.  The shoot was after midnight in a cemetery, creepy fun.",1408147200,,137,4.037037037037037
8121674,1,B000FFJYD4,"This movie is just bad. A vampire, zombie horror flick, where vampires make zombies. I tried to enjoy this movie being a horror movie lover but I could not even finish this waste of film. Please, please do not waste your time on this film.",1370304000,,239,4.333333333333333
8121675,1,B000FFJYD4,"If you think ""hey, this looks good"" just by looking at the DVD cover, YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! This is an extremely low budget B movie. The actors are like zombies and the storyline is pure suckage. I'm not being cruel here- I can't believe I actually paid $1 for this. My dvd player will be mad at me forever now.",1255132800,,311,4.114754098360656
8121676,1,B000FFJYD4,"THIS MOVIE WAS SHOT IN VIDEO NOT FILM.  IT LOOKS LIKE A STUDENT FILM, THE ACTORS ARE TERRIBLE AND THE PLOT LINE MAKES NO SENSE.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN A VAMPIRE BITE SOMEONE AND THE VICTIMS ARE TRANSFORMED INTO ZOMBIES.
DON'T WASTE YOUR RENTAL FEE OR TIME WATCHING THIS ON CABLE.",1201910400,2,275,4.372549019607843
8121677,1,B000FFJYD4,"AFTER SUNDOWN is one bad horror flick trying to mix the vampire and zombie genres to no avail.  The acting, editing, script and effects show how small their budget was.  And just how many bodies are in this darned morgue anyway?  And what is it with Deputy Billy's way too large hat?  At one minute, he's got it on; next it mysteriously vanishes; then in the next scene, there's the twenty gallon monster again.  This movie offers nothing new for horror fans, same old jerky slow moving zombies, a vampire with no bite..a really awful movie.",1156118400,,541,4.59375
8121678,1,B000FFJYD4,"This is a disgustingly boring movie with D- actors and a ridiculous plot. How can you make zombies out of a vampire bite? and when did zombies start RUNNING after their prey? Compared to '28 days later"" and ""From dusk til dawn 1"", this movie is a joke. I'm being generous with a star. It actually deserves a quarter of a star.",1156118400,,326,4.274193548387097
8121679,2,B000FFJYD4,"When a sheriff and his deputy rescue three people from a horde of zombies, the sheriff backs the car up to flee when Mikey one of the rescued says, ""Run them over""  and the sheriff says straight-faced, ""You jest cain't run over people, jest cause theys dead.""  Other than that the movie pretty much stinks and I always thought when a vampire bites that produces another vampire not a zombie.",1155427200,,391,4.571428571428571
8121680,5,B000FFJYD4,"This movie was a labour of love for all involved! I should know, I played a ZOMBIE HORDE extra!!!
