8303068,4,B001FXXGQG,"I attended a Rich Dad seminar in New York and this program was being offered.  Of the 30 or so people that were there, only five of us purchased ""You Can Choose To Be Rich.""  I'm glad I did!  Robert's lessons learned from his rich and poor dads (and from his business successes and failures) are absolutely priceless and have paid off for me many times over.  It's not a ""how to"" program, but it will give you a clear cut path to shape your own financial destiny.  Most of the lessons involved simple common sense and a change of mindset.  People say that Robert's program is risky; what is risky is anyone who doesn't seize this opportunity to become financially free and benefit from what he's trying to teach us.",1258156800,,715,4.419847328244275
