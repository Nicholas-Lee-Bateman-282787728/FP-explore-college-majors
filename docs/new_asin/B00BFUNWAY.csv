Leander Paes is a big tennis star in India but he wanted to start acting, and this was his debut into Bollywood.

'Rajdhani Express' is an analysis of Human's attitudes and behaviours; four people are in a train compartment together, Banerjee is a Bollywood writer (played brilliantly by Prianshu Chatterjee), Munish is a suave fashion designer, Reena is a wealthy woman who 'sells herself' (to put it nicely) and who considers herself 'hot stuff'. Throw in Keshav, a poor person who does drug-running for a living, and then you witness how people like to act according to their status they want to take, and how, even in a train carriage with four people, humans want to create status and classes.

Banerjee is very entertaining, he is a bit snobby, a bit patronising towards Keshav, but always trying to be nice and friendly, and seems strangely real in a world of pretension, I especially love the line where everyone else is revealing their secrets and he says 'Well, I really am a Bollywood writer'

Despite walloping reviews, Leander Paes' acting is brilliant, at first he feels shy and awkward amongst people of 'high society', then he tries to get back at them by pointing a gun at them and yelling, and then when he realises he might be in a lot of trouble, he acts crazy and baby-like, hoping insanity might save him. He portrays this desperate person brilliantly.

Jimmy Shergill is excellent as corrupt commissioner Yadav who takes advantage of the situation and puts everyone's life in danger.

The most shocking part is at the end, when Banerjee and Reena explain what really happened, not what Yadav says what happened, and peoples' reaction to it. There's a lot of interesting social commentary here.

I'd give the movie 7 / 10, it lacks in that sometimes the plot seems to stop and there's a bit of chaos, like people standing around getting hysterical, but that's alright because this is meant as an analysis of personality and human behaviour, but is still full of suspense.
