589353,5,6303182240,"I did this video ten years ago also and it is awesome! No exaggeration here - I saw definition in my abs within TWO WEEKS. Mind you I was 23 at the time and I while my abs were not ""of steel"", they weren't flopping over my belt either. STILL, this video works. Im going to buy it again and see what happens a decade later! Classics are classics for a reason - they work. Tamilee Webb must be about fifty years old by now and she's still working it out.",1201219200,,452,3.978021978021978
589354,4,6303182240,"This is the perfect follow up to abs of steel 1.  It's hard, so do #1 first.  And don't bother buying 3 and 4.  They are a waste of time, and don't get any harder.",1175558400,2,163,3.6
589355,5,6303182240,"Tamilee Webb ups the ante in ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO, as anyone who worked out with her in the first ABS OF STEEL knows.  But for either greater challenge or simply a change of pace, those who own Tamilee's first ABS OF STEEL tape will want this one, too.  If you own neither, the first one is better choice and if you like Tamilee's style, upgrade to this one.

While the first ABS OF STEEL video offers three 10-minute workout segments, ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO puts you through two 15-minute segments.  But instructor Tamilee Webb isn't just making you exercise longer.  She also works you harder, as both segments but especially the first one take you through moves that are more difficult than the routines in the first ABS OF STEEL video.

The ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO box cover features pictures of Tamilee Webb wearing what seems to be a scandalously revealing thong.  As Tamilee wears french-cut workout shorts to show off her big beautiful bottom in the first ABS OF STEEL, the thong photos on the cover of ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO may make you think she's out to top herself in every way this time around.  But(t) don't get your hopes up, as(s) it's a bait-and-switch: Throughout ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO Tamilee wears a full set of workout shorts, the little tease.  Bummer, especially since she does several sets of push-ups that would have been, well, cheeky of her if she wore the thong she's wearing on the box cover!

As(s) if to make up for the switcheroo, the workout shorts Tamilee Webb wears in ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO fit her fabulous form, providing several eyefuls of that perky posterior.  The snug shorts flatter Tamilee's behind best in the last set of push-ups, as(s) what must have been a male camera operator makes the most of the final opportunity to check out Tamilee's tush.

I don't know why Tamilee Webb wears a hat in  ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO, but I would like to know how it stays on her head throughout the warm-up and both workout segments.  However Tamilee really defies gravity with the eye-popping sports bra she barely wears.  Maybe it's special effects, but I'd like to know how Tamilee's heaving bosoms don't fall out of what looks like a top two sizes too small.  It's as if Tamilee was out of clean wardrobe and borrowed that sports bra from her under-developed teen-age sister.",1167264000,,2314,4.553140096618358
589356,5,6303182240,"After having five children and being 46 years old, there was no way I was going to have good abs.  I was wrong.  This tape has done what nothing else has done in the past 17 years!  I have rock hard, washboard abs, and no one would believe that I have ever had five kids!  Granted I do do both workouts EVERY DAY; one in the morning, the other at night, and I am on a high protein diet, but this tape WORKS.  I also sometimes do Tami Lee's first Abs of Steel, just for variety.  Another good one!",1125964800,11,496,3.95959595959596
589357,5,6303182240,"Abs of Steel 2 uses most of the same exercises from Abs of Steel 1, but increases the reps, speed, and duration of them. She also adds modified push ups to the routines. A definite all-around workout for the abs. Great for at-home solo training.",1113264000,8,245,4.466666666666667
589358,5,6303182240,"I've had video for close to 10 years now, and it's still a regular part of my exercise rotation - because it works! The two 15-minute programs are advanced and challenging - the first focuses on the front part of the abdominals and the second focuses more on the obliques. Both alternate abdominals and push-ups. Most of the exercises are done with the legs and arms off the floor so you can't cheat. Tamilee is always smiling and looks like she's having a great time doing the workout. She has a master's degree and teaches you all the proper names for the muscles as you do the workout. So you get smarter as well as stronger!",1109894400,9,628,4.422413793103448
589359,5,6303182240,"THE FIRST WORKOUT EVERYTHING IS WELL DONE TO EACH SIDE , HOWEVER ON THE WORKOUT #2 SHE WORKS ONE SIDE OF THE OBLIQUES THROUGH AND THEN DOES 10 PUSHUPS THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE AFTER THE ISOMETRIC SHE GOES TO THE NEXT EXERCISE WHEN ON THE OTHER SIDE AFTER THE ISOMETRIC SHE SAID HOLD IT THERE AND DID 8 COUNTS OF THE LITTLE CRUNCHES THAT BURN , IF YOU OWN THIS WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF AND DO IT

 HOPED YOU UNDERSTANDED THIS AND CORRECT IT THE NEXT TIME AND IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY IT BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST ONE EVEN IF SHE MADE THIS MISTAKE BUT NOW YOU CAN CORRECT IT

 THANKS FOR READING! , KARLA",1104796800,8,613,4.0
589360,5,6303182240,The workout is broken up into two segments each 15 minutes which is great for me.  I can spare 15 minutes a day to get my abs in shape.  It's a fast workout with results.  I love it.  I work my abs everyday with short videos like this.  This tape is definately a KEEPER!!!,1098921600,5,272,3.962962962962963
589361,5,6303182240,This video has 2 15-minute workouts.  It has ab work followed by push-ups.  The exercises are very intense.  Tamilee gives alternate movements depending on your level of fitness.  This video is very challenging with quick results.,1001030400,8,230,5.305555555555555
7840225,3,6303182240,"I bought this tape because I love Abs of Steel 1.  I have been using AB1 for years and years and it really works!  (Note: I am female.)  But I wanted something new even though it was on VHS.  AB2 has two workouts.  The first one uses many of the same moves from AB1.  The second one is different but I found it hard to duplicate the angles and I didn't feel it in my abs very much.  So I have not been very impressed with the abs portion.  I do like the pushups though -- really felt it in my shoulders and back of my arms. And Tammy is very cute wearing a black cap, though she is still as professional as ever.",1522972800,,612,3.879032258064516

7840228,5,6303182240,Excellent video--Tamilee Webb is a terrific instructor.  This workout is an oldie but a goodie.,1444608000,,95,5.333333333333333
7840229,5,6303182240,And so did my wife.  The work out has fantastic results.,1437955200,,56,4.090909090909091
7840230,5,6303182240,"Great video although it's old this ab workout is amazing. I have lost about 2 inches off my waist my stomach is so flat all over, it's amazing. I also really like the push-ups. This workout stands the test of time, this ab work is not outdated.",1435536000,,244,4.212765957446808
7840231,3,6303182240,"I found Abs of Steel 1 far superior. I didn't like how this one broke up each workout with pushups. It felt like the contraction on the abs got lost every time this happened and I didn't find my abs screaming like they do with the original Abs of Steel. And, the original is shorter (10 min vs. 15 and there are 3 workouts on it).",1419984000,,330,4.015151515151516
7840232,5,6303182240,"OLDIE but GOODIE, If you use it, It works, The video is from an earlier date and the outfits show that,but the workouts are great.",1402531200,,130,4.24
7840233,5,6303182240,I used Abs of steel #1 for a long time and now purchased #2. This is really challenging and a nice addition to my abs routine collection. I suggest starting with Tape #1 first until your abs get strong or you will be sorry. If you are adverse to anyone wearing a hat then don't get it. If you want tight strong abs I highly recommend it. thanks!,1364083200,,345,4.088235294117647
7840234,1,6303182240,"I hate to say something ""sucks"" but this one does. The instructor is so annoying & she's wearing this baseball hat that makes her look like an  80's crack whore... the moves also aren't that great. This is another routine that I couldn't finish because it was so boring & the instructor was really quite lame.",1284940800,,309,4.517857142857143
