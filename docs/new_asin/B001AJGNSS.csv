8339624,5,B001AJGNSS,"I hardly know where to start...This film has more in 53 minutes than any two-hour movie! The main theme is ""transformation"" of a community, city or even country due to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit of God. What this transformation does is incredible! The greatest miracle, of course, is the salvation of hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of souls; the after-affect is quite astounding also. Communities experience drastic crime reduction to the point, in some cases, that even jails close down! Unemployment plummets, liquor stores and bars close down, and people can walk down streets at night they wouldn't have dared previously.
This isn't just some utopium dream made into a movie...this is really happening all over the world!

There are two unfortunates here: One, we don't hear about it from our liberal news media. Two, it's not happening in the United States to any great extent. But, it is happening (or was at the time of this dvd release in 2003) in over 100 areas world-wide, up from eight areas in 1999.

The second part of the program deals with how it (God's Outpouring)  begins, and then how to bring it to your community. It brings the viewer to the critical point of responsibility...each one of us!
If you are self-obsessed, (like I regrettably tend to be) then this is one movie that will convict you. Whether you know God or not, ""The Quickening"" makes you realize how much or how much more we need Him.

I have a movie list of several hundred movies (including all my favorites) to which I give each a 1-100 ranking. This is the first one to receive as high as a 99! This is an absolute must see! I just got this dvd last week and am looking to get more copies...(probably shooting my foot off with this rave review) but people just gotta' see this one!",1226620800,,1793,4.628930817610063
