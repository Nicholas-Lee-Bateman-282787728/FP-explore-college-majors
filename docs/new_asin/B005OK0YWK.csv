4852588,4,B005OK0YWK,"If you like Indian lore & magic, this movie from the '70's is pretty good.  Chief Dan George does a great job as Old Man Hawk, leaving his home to find his grandson Michael (Jan Michael Vincent) to help him get rid of the evil spirit that's terrorizing his people.  Marilyn Hasset, a journalist gets involved with the two when she helps Old Man Hawk find his grandson & she winds up traveling with them back to the village.  Michael is kind of a jerk at first, more concerned about his career & making money than he is about taking care of his grandfather, but he does the right thing & shows character & responsibility.  He also learns to embrace his heritage & learns a great deal about himself in the process.  One of the great scenes in this movie is watching the vintage car crash into the invisible wall Old Man Hawk makes on the road.  I enjoyed watching it.",1353715200,4,865,4.341614906832298
4852589,5,B005OK0YWK,"Chief Dan George is so realistic in dealing with spiritual issues on a first nations reserve. I could relate as he is so similar to my Native American grandmother. The movie visually  depicts what is often invisible yet is a part of life in our Rez culture.
I'm so grateful this movie is available for purchase now. I've searched to buy it before without success.",1333324800,4,363,4.584615384615384

4852591,5,B005OK0YWK,This is a great Native American thriller.  It is steeped in Native American lore in a 20th century setting.  You'll have to watch it a couple of times for elements you get just a glimpse at or to make sense of certain scenes.  Well worth the price!,1317859200,9,248,4.23404255319149

4852615,4,B005OK0YWK,"Intriguing tale of magic & mysticism. Not really sure who the target audience was for this film, since it focuses entirely on Native Americans and their spiritual beliefs, yet has 2 whites in the leading roles while supporting player Chief Dan George is the only Native American actor with more than a few seconds' screen time. Anyhoo... the story deals with the reincarnation of an ancient evil witch in a small Indian village in the northwestern part of America or Canada. (The movie was shot in Canada.) The settlement's medicine man, (George as 'Old Man Hawk'), is getting long in the tooth and realizes that he must pass his powers & knowledge down to his grandson if the demonic witch woman is to be defeated. Jan-Michael Vincent plays Michael Hawk, a half-breed who left the village more than a decade ago and now lives over 300 miles away, working as an exec in The Big City. After some arguing between the two men, younger Hawk agrees to escort his ailing grandfather back to the remote village, with a nosy reporter in tow (the beautiful Marilyn Hassett). From that point on the film becomes a roughshod journey through Hell as the witch and her earthly followers use every fiendish trick at their command to try and thwart the return of the medicine man & his successor. These scary encounters include several harrowing attacks on the younger Hawk's sweet Toyota Land Cruiser, along remote stretches of beautiful mountain roads. (What an awesome old rig!) :-)

This movie, while fun & engaging, suffers from a gaunt, low budget feel and isn't entirely successful because of it. The finished product here is very rough and seems to have needed at least one more polish on the script, as well as a more experienced person in the director's chair. Still in all, it does manage to be creepy, occasionally unsettling and pretty exciting, despite the shortcomings. This film has many of the same spooky/demonic vibes that made the equally obscure Indian revenge flick ""Shadow of Chikara"" (also known by several other titles) such an effectively creepy ghost story. That terrific little film from Howco Pictures is available here on Amazon btw, as ""Curse of Demon Mountain,"" albeit in a crappy, heavily-edited edition from some fly-by-night outfit calling itself Synergy Entertainment. Meh.

Jan-Michael Vincent is young, wiry and very toned here. This film was shot just a few years after he did ""The World's Greatest Athlete"" for Walt Disney, and about 6 years before he played another Hawk (Stringfellow) on AIRWOLF. Chief Dan George lends his typically wise, strong and somewhat shaky screen presence as Old Man Hawk. He must've walked on over from the set of ""Outlaw Josey Wales"" to work on this. Marilyn Hassett, (best known for her turn as real-life Olympic ski team hopeful Jill Kinmont, who became paralyzed in a tragic accident in 1975's ""The Other Side of The Mountain"" and its 1978 sequel), is really easy on the eyes, but honestly serves no real purpose in the narrative of this film other than to be someone in trouble for our two mystic medicine men heroes to worry about and dote over. The ongoing series of conflicts that the younger Hawk must endure on his way back to the village to face the witch in the final battle are varied and some are particularly hair-raising, if not entirely convincing.

The release of this film onto home video is in a DVD-r format, so some of you with older players MAY have trouble viewing it. Newer players and Blu-ray machines shouldn't have any troubles. My bargain basement Sony Blu-ray played it just fine. The film has not had ANY restorative work done to it. It is in 16x9 widescreen, so I do not know if that was the original aspect ratio or if it's been cropped for modern widescreen TVs. Even so, the colors are strong and solid. No fading or noticeably bad print damage was detected. The occasional speck of dust or dirt here & there, but nothing that took you out of the film. The sound was clear & strong as well, with only minimal distortion (pops & hissing), which one would expect from a direct film-to-video transfer without any restoration. This was a fun little film and offered a few decent twists & turns on the way to its rushed but satisfying conclusion. I enjoyed it, the film looks & sounds good and has decent replay value, so I give it 4 STARS.",1419811200,,4324,4.739707835325365

4852619,5,B005OK0YWK,"My wife and I saw this movie at a drive-in theater when it was new, billed as the second or ""B"" movie. It was the better film (we don't even remember the other film). This film stuck with us. It was unpretentious with ok special effects but the story was very well told and having a real Indian Chief play the medicine man gave it a perfect ambience. It was a joy to watch again and can be watched by the whole family except perhaps the very small as they might have nightmares. Recommended!",1403395200,5,491,4.23404255319149

4852621,5,B005OK0YWK,I loved this movie growing up and could never find it in video stores. I was excited to find it on DVD and have been sharing it with many friends.,1387497600,,146,3.9
8481396,4,B005OK0YWK,"A thoughtful and positive take on Native American / First Nations culture and folklore, as it tells a spooky tale of a reluctant hero returning to his roots.

With that said, this movie SCARED THE POO OUT OF ME as a child. Some kids are frightened by dogs, others are afraid of snakes, yet others are scared of clowns. None of these bothered me much, but MY childhood fear was masks. And the villain of SHADOW OF THE HAWK is played by... um, well, a mask.

So anyway, when I was eight, I spent the summer at my grandparents' house and we watched this movie on TV. While their house was contemporary, stylish, and impeccably clean, there was a long hallway, with a couple of 90 bends. Whenever I turned a corner by myself at night, I just *knew* the evil spirit was going to be waiting for me, with that flowing hair, those vacant eyes, and mouth drawn into a permanent SLURPthe better for devouring the souls of little boys walking alone in the dark. Forget Freddy, or Jason, or Pennywise. That horrible ghost-bitch was the creepiest thing I would ever see on film (at least, until I saw THE DARK CRYSTAL, with even more hideous evil puppet nightmare fuel).

Anyway, I watched it again this weekend, for the first time in many years. Every time the evil spirit appeared, I chuckled to myself, longing for the simpler scares of childhood. Every once in a while, I glanced over to a photograph on my walltaken that very same summerof me with my now-departed Granddaddy. If I could send a message to Past-Me, I would tell him: conquer your fear, and youll be just fine.",1508025600,,1566,4.487719298245614

8481398,5,B005OK0YWK,"I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid so I only remembered bits and pieces of it. It was much better than I thought it would be, especially in the horror genre. There was a lot more Native American culture than I remembered and Chief Dan George is always good.  The special effects were good for 1976 and the movie has aged well compared to other old movies that I've revisited as an adult. ""That car is evil!"" This is that movie and I'm very happy I found it again.",1486944000,,471,4.119565217391305
