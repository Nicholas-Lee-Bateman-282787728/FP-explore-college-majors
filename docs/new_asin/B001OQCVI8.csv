3731838,3,B001OQCVI8,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Experiments on specially gifted human beings have been going on since the 1940s
2. Unfortunately, the mortality rate is through the roof, until ...
3. Someone survives, but ...
4. She escapes, and takes the secret formula with her
5. Luckily, this has all been foreseen by a very talented Watcher (person who sees the future), and then ...
6. The convoluted plot takes over, throwing Watchers, Pushers, Movers, Bleeders, Shifters, Shadows, Wipers, Stitches and Sniffs together in Hong Kong, where ""gifted"" people seem to crawl out of the woodwork without explanation.
7. Even without trying to sort out the plot, this one is action-packed, but may make your brain hurt.

Reasonable acting and popping special effects are the main reasons to watch this movie, which doesn't bother stopping to reason why, but does and does, until the horribly anti-climactic ending.

Rent it because it's there, or if someone ""pushes"" you to see it.

3731839,4,B001OQCVI8,"This is a great movie. It's really neat seeing ""Dakota Fanning"" growing up in each movie that she does. The storyline seems simple at first but at times things can get a bit complicated but everything becomes clear at the end. To me this movie reminds me a little bit of the TV series ""Dark Angel"". So if you liked that show or if you simply just love action movies, you'll get into this.",1243296000,,388,4.256756756756757
3731840,5,B001OQCVI8,"Before I get into the reasons I gave this movie a 5 star, I think a lot of people, myself included, expected something completely different. That I blame on the trailer for this movie, which shows a lot of action scenes and powers being used. I expected a lot more of the pushing type of power and mind control use over people. It didn't matter to me that those were few and far between but for people looking for action, I don't think it would fit. Being based in Hong Kong, I'm surprised there wasn't more of a variety of scenery. Maybe it's been too long since I saw it, but it seemed to revolve around a Hong Kong market, every place they ran looked the same. But the main reason I still loved it was how amazing Dakota Fanning was. Most child stars get into an awkward phase and either come back later on or stay on the 'I was a child actor' list.
But between this movie, and two other recent ones, ""Hounddog"" and ""The Secret Life of Bees"",the difference in characters Dakota has played and how well she played them,proves she will not be going away anytime soon.
I was extremely impressed with her performance and her relationship with Chris Evans was very realistic. Chris Evans is a favorite actor of mine too. When the end came, I was waiting for more but hopefully if it does well when it's released on dvd, there will be a following movie. So basically, the 5 stars are for the actors. It still was a good movie,
just not as the trailer made it seem. In my opinion,anyone who likes movies based on comic books or video games would enjoy this movie much more than people who don't.",1240963200,5,1591,4.342281879194631
3731841,3,B001OQCVI8,"Deep in the bowels of the US government, there's a program called simply ""The Division."" They're a competitor offshoot of a Nazi scheme from World War II to create the ultimate psychic soldiers.

Nick (Chris Evans) is first seen as a little boy, who is told by his father to run and don't think too far ahead of what he's doing or the Watchers will catch him. The Division comes for Nick's Dad and kills him.

""A waste,"" the Division employee comments. ""Take his body to the lab.""

Ten years later, we see Nick in China. He's a Mover with the gift of telekinesis. He's accosted by 13-year-old Cassie (Dakota Fanning), a Watcher or psychic.  She's seen a way where she and Nick can bust The Division at last.  All they have to do is get a case from them.

What they don't know is that the Chinese mafia want the case as well and they have a Watcher who can read intentions as well as the future.

The story's also complicated by the appearance of Kira (Camilla Belle) who is Nick's ex-girlfriend and the only Division patient to survive a steroid cocktail the Division medicos created to make their superpowers even stronger.  Turns out, the steroid cocktail is actually what's in the suitcase that Nick and Cassie are trying to obtain.

We also discover a myriad of other gifted ex-Division people from a stitcher (healer), shadow (obscurer), sniffer (human hound dog) and a pusher (someone who can change a person's thoughts with their mind).

Not only is the plot a bit overcomplicated, matters are worse because part of the story is told in Chinese subtitles.  Still, this is an interesting and edgy performance by Fanning, who was trying to break out of her 'cute' mold.

If you're a die-hard sci fi or Fanning fan you will probably enjoy ""Push."" If you're looking for more simple enjoyment, you might want to see ""Inkheart"" or ""Race to Witch Mountain.""

3731842,4,B001OQCVI8,"Nick (Evans) is a ""mover"" - someone who can move things with his mind.  He meets up with Cassie (Fanning), a ""watcher"" - someone who can predict the future.  She is trying to rescue her mother from the government, but as they try to piece things together, Kira (Belle) enters their lives.  Kira is a ""pusher"" - someone who can influence others thoughts.  She also had a relationship with Nick, and is the only person to survive a power ""enhancement"" drug that was administered to her by the sinister Company.  Now, the Company is after her, and Nick and Kira must help her if they want to survive.

""Push"" is a gritty looking superhero movie that is not based on any existing comic book (for a change).  It is fast paced and rich in mythology.  Evans, who has some experience in these types of movies, is credible as Nick.  Fanning, who is great in any movie she appears in, can add action star to her resume.  The story is full of backstory, but that does not slow down the almost nonstop action.  The gritty look adds to the feel of the film, and works well.  ""Push"" is a surprisingly good film, and I recommend checking it out.",1235088000,78,1130,4.405797101449275
3731843,3,B001OQCVI8,"The premise comes across as threadbare: people with special abilities, a secret government agency with a fondness for human experiments, and a criminal cartel (also Talented) out for the same thing as the government's agents. Yes, it's been done, and been done better. Still, this represents a fair specimen of its sort.

On the positive side, Dakota Fanning does a fair job as knobby-kneed and smart-mouthed tweenage character. The movie plays by its own rules, too, it doesn't just keep inventing more magic every time the plot droops. Action keeps the movie moving, right on up to the big dramatic scene at the end. And, although I generally found the effects to be effective, the actors really pulled the story along, not just the hope of some really cool visuals in the next scene.

I doubt that I'll remember much detail a week from now, or much want to. No matter, this makes a fair evening's entertainment, with near-zero nudity and reasonably restrained gore. Maybe you could do better than see this movie, but you could do worse, too.

3731844,1,B001OQCVI8,"Push is such a bad film, I don't know wear to begin! What troubled me most was that ""Kill or Be Killed - On Steroids,"" is the main message you got from watching this depraved film. It does not have an ounce of charm, humor or heart! It's like watching someone's nightmare in slow motion! It's a black and white world where the color ""gray"" has never been invented! You could also classify Push as a war-porn type film pandering to those who like watching the body count rise!

The writers of Push are so desperate for you to notice at least one main character they had to exploit a 13-year old girl by constantly showing off her long, spindly legs. Keeping in mind this is a film made
for adults, and not teens, I felt that was very inappropriate! Making her cry about her fear of dying was sad to watch, also. But she's certainly the only character in this film anyone is going to care about.

For the life of me, I don't understand why Hollywood constantly pumps out really bad films like Push. It give the whole fantasy genre a bad name! How can that possibly be good for business?

3731845,3,B001OQCVI8,"Dakota Fanning is growing up.  As with many child stars, that transition can be touchy at best (whatever happened to Haley Joel Osment?).  Fanning started by playing the plucky, sensitive young teenager experiencing her first love in THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES.  While many found the movie to be full of gooey sentimentality, it worked for me quite well, and Fanning was a big part of that.

In PUSH, she is playing a ""tough guy"" role, as a young teen out to kick butt.  A young teen who is also a ""watcher,"" a person who has the power to see (sort of) into the future.  She's dressed in funky clothes and has part of her hair dyed pink.  While she isn't entirely unconvincing, her ensemble just doesn't quite work.

And that's the way it is with the whole film.  It seems like it ought to be pretty good, but it somehow just doesn't quite work.  It tells the story of a large group of ""mutants"" who live among us in a shadow-society, each with special talents such as watching, pushing (getting others to believe what you want them to and ""pushing"" them into acting based on that false belief), sniffing, etc. etc.  These powers are strong in some and barely utilized by others.  We meet one of those lazy others in Chris Evans, a mutant who can make objects move based on his force of thought. We see him trying to hone those skills well enough to make dice land how he wants them to, but he isn't very good at that.  Yet he finds himself in the position to be the only guy who can help Fanning retrieve some kind of drug (one that can either kill a mutant or step up that mutants powers to unknown heights) and keep it out of the hands of ""The Division,"" a quasi-governmental agency that has been running the experiments that both created and exploited the mutants.  AND they need to keep the drug away from a Hong Kong cartel of mutants that wishes to steal the drug from The Division.

Oh, did I mention the entire movie is set in Hong Kong, one of the wildest, most crowded, most difficult to navigate places on earth?  It's perfect for lots of ""running around"" behavior, which PUSH is full of.

Back to the plot:  Camilla Belle plays another mutant, the only one who has been able to survive an injection of this drug.  She's ALSO a target for the various groups...yet she may not be what she seems to be either.

All of this is played out, seemingly, over the course of a few hours, and each scene takes place in some Hong Kong location that just screams with wild colors and a crazy design aesthetic.  I don't know if the city is truly as eclectic (and occasionally monumentally tacky) as depicted here...but it sure kept PUSH from ever being easy on the eye.  Each hotel room or restaurant was more garish than the next.  My wife and I had to laugh at the outlandish floor and wall treatments at time...and in a good way.  I thoroughly enjoyed the creativity on display...however unburdened by understatement it may have been.

Oh, and Djimon Hounsou is the lead tracker (who happens to be a Pusher as well) of The Division, and he's a pretty evil guy who loves to push people into committing suicide.

Is this review bouncing around incoherently?  That's sort of how I felt watching the film.  There were many elements to admire, and I found Chris Evans to be an affable everyman to be our ""tour guide"" through this world...but I never could completely make sense of it all.  Why was the Division SO eager to get the syringe with the drug...surely they could make more?  Why go through so much effort to recover it, when destroying it would have been simpler?  Why exactly did Evans' character need to be involved in the story at all?  Why did the movie feel so much like HEROES meets X-MEN...but without the character development of the former and the coherent storytelling of the latter?

Some of the action sequences were good, and the movie moves at a brisk pace.  But nonetheless, I still found myself growing bored at times, and I truly didn't have any emotional investment in the outcome whatsoever.  Part of the problem was the script, which did little to make sense of the story (or even the backstory, given to us by a voiceover during the opening credits).  And part of the problem, frankly, was the casting of Camilla Belle as the human object of everyone's attention.  She came across as bland and dispirited and so very uninteresting.  And Hounsou was quite generic as well.  He's an imposing, charismatic actor...but most of that was lost here.  He was trying for quite villainy, but mostly just got the quiet part right.

PUSH ends with a cliffhanger of sorts, clearly thinking a sequel would be coming.  Heck, they even tell us what the sequel would be about.  But based on the first film's quality, and the tepid response at the box office, I don't see much chance for PUSH 2 (or PUSH HARDER).  Then again, all sorts of things make their way to Direct-To-Video, so you never know.

Hey, at least the film make me want to see Hong Kong in person.",1234137600,,4971,4.486636971046771
3731846,3,B001OQCVI8,"PUSH tantalizes you with its premise and its central characters, hooks you in with that promising movie trailer, and then jerks you around like a hot but very mean girlfriend. Given, there's enough of what's cool here to nerd out on, but, ultimately, this paranormal thriller is  lacking that sumthin' sumthin'.

In the world of PUSH there are people who possess awesome psychic abilities. And, dating back to World War II and Nazi Germany, clandestine efforts have been made to control and experiment on these extraordinary paranormals. Decades later, and things haven't changed, only now it's a shadowy American government agency, simply called the Division, conducting these tests. There's this drug which is supposed to boost psychic abilities to ridiculous levels. The caveat is that, so far, only one patient has survived the injecting of this drug. And she just scampered the hell out.

The central character is Nick Gant (Evans), trying to keep a low profile in Hong Kong, if by low profile it's meant that Nick gambles with street thugs and uses his feeble telekinesis to influence the outcome of the dice rolls. Nick has been on the run ever since his dad got whacked by Division agents ten years ago. But now sniffers have ferreted out his location. About to amscray the eff out, Nick gets a knock on his door and this is where Dakota Fanning enters the picture and where the main storyline gets going.

13-year-old Cassie Holmes (Fanning) is a clairvoyant, although her talent is wobbly and, being a shaky artist at best, it's sometimes hard to make out what prophetic visions she's sketching on her drawing pad. But she manages to convince Nick to help her locate a mysterious woman and secure her all-important suitcase - of which course of action, Cassie foretells, will save Nick and Cassie's lives and also take down the Division. So off they go, and eventually hook up with Kira (Camilla Belle), the young woman being sought by everyone and also someone who shares a past with Nick. And, yes, Kira is the very one who'd just broken out of the Division facility.

In watching this movie, a grasp of its parlance is a must. PUSH's world is peopled with disparate talents categorized as watchers, pushers, movers, shifters, bleeders, wipers, sniffers, etc. I'll leave it to the movie to go into what the rest of these are, but I will say that Nick is a mover and Cassie is a watcher. Kira is a pusher, which means that she can sneak (or ""push"") thoughts and even false histories into your mind. The Big Bad is Division's lead agent Henry Carver (a low key, ineffective Djimon Hounsou), a formidable puppet master. Yep, he's a pusher.

In its comic book sensibilities, PUSH has a whiff of X-Men about it, and HEROES, and even David Cronenberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scanners/dp/B00005K3NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scanners</a>&nbsp;(except without that gratuitous visceral touch). Throw in the sometimes dynamic psychic combats, the two appealing leads, and the vibrancy of the Hong Kong backdrop, and you get what's good in the flick. There are several neat moments to savor, whether its Nick and Cassie's skirmish at the fish market with a Chinese crime lord and his psychic family, or the image of Nick and his guns ominously floating above him, Kira's full control of her people marionettes, or, in one of the film's best scenes, a drunk Dakota Fanning (supposedly, imbibing liquor focuses her clairvoyant powers). While Chris Evans (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cellular-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B0006D3HGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cellular (New Line Platinum Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JNTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)</a>) is likeable and does okay as the film's main lead, it won't stun anyone that Fanning steals the scenes and acts circles around everyone on the set (the skimpy characterisations don't help, either). But I dig that brother/younger sister vibe going on between Evans and Fanning. Fanning, by the way, looks to be entering premature babehood. (Mreeow! - What? No? Too young? Okay, fine.)

What PUSH has in flair and premise, it lacks in narrative clarity. The intriguing visual treats don't quite compensate for the muddled plot points. The most egregious thing which struck me (and which I think loses the film heaps of credibility) is why would the government even risk experimenting on their psychic subjects just to boost their powers, when these subjects persist in dying out when given the injection? Are there so many psychics floating around that the Division can afford to be so blase? Just seems so counterproductive. I also struggle with Nick, basically a nondescript dude (excepting the telekinesis) of seemingly average smarts, suddenly transforming into this master strategist. On top of that, his endgame plan (contingent on ""What if nothing we did made any sense?"") might be crafty but its onscreen execution is presented poorly. Also a let down was in the anticlimactic manner in which Cassie's premonition of her own death plays out.

The film drags in spots; I seriously felt all of its near two hours' running time. See, in an attempt to add texture, it indulges in too much back story and reels under the weight of its clunky mythology. And also too much dull exposition. A prime example of weak villain monologuing is Nick's conversation with Carver (with Nick's gun telekinetically pressed against Carver's skull). I saw how that was gonna go down as soon as Carver opened his yap.

I hope I can explain this right. I'm not sure what, but it seems to me that there's some necessary groundwork here that wasn't laid out. Also, with so many of the characters endowed with some abnormal aptitude or other, there's a diminishing of that sense of wonder. I dunno, maybe the flick could've used the perspective of a secondary character, some regular Joe, who gets all awed and freaked out by all the crazy going down. As it is, big whoopee, everyone's got a power. And, of course, there's that deux ex machina flavor factored in, too. The thing about introducing clairvoyance is that you then can get away with so many coincidences. Gotcher bones and muscles all scrunched up? Just wait for the stitch (healer) to show up; she'll be sent by someone who saw this coming years and years ago. It feels too convenient. At least, Cassie's knack, unlike her mini-skirt, isn't too revealing.

Part of the muddle concerns the ending, of which there isn't any, really. There's a sense of unfinished business, as the end credits roll up. PUSH has got the 'nads to already set up for the sequel, the plot of which will, in all likelihood, revolve around the springing of Cassie's mother (who is the world's most powerful watcher) from Division captivity. Sucker that I am, I like the core characters enough and the premise enough that I'll probably line up for it. It may not sound like it, but I do dig this genre. The frustrating thing being, that PUSH could've been better. And I won't even mention JUMPER.",1233964800,70,7190,5.195858498705781
3731847,3,B001OQCVI8,"Push showcases a remarkable amount of creativity and potential, yet oddly shifts between a state of incompletion and overdevelopment.  The film ends too soon but takes too long in getting to its truncated conclusion, and a surplus in character quantity allows few to be explored adequately.  Movers, Pushers, Shifters, Sniffers, Bleeders, Watchers, and more inhabit this unique realm of psychically enhanced beings, and while each has a specific super power, most feel like they were invented just to counter the abilities of another type of psychic warrior.

The Division, a group of government agents charged with experimenting on those gifted with psychic powers, has devised a serum that will drastically enhance the user's performance.  The only drawback is that none have survived the dosage - until now.  Kira (Camilla Belle) is a ""pusher"" (able to force a fabricated reality into another's mind) who has withstood the normally fatal injection, and upon escaping her captors, manages to stay one step ahead of them by utilizing her tremendous psychic gift.  Cassie (Dakota Fanning) is a ""watcher"" (able to see into an ever-changing future) who seeks out downtrodden Nick (Chris Evans) a ""mover"" who has squandered his talent for moving objects with his mind.  Together the duo must rescue Kira from The Division's main puppet Carver (Djimon Hounsou) and locate a mysterious case that contains the last hope of bringing down the tyrannical agency.

The overlong third act in Push is largely dependent on circumstances that have no factual support. Nick realizes that every move they make is being predicted by other watchers; the only way to avoid intentions that can be tracked is to be completely spontaneous. This involves plotting out a scheme and then having his memory wiped just far back enough that he won't remember coming up with the plan. Since when was Nick so brilliant that he could devise such a solution - let alone one that a group of talented psychic warriors would blindly follow? It's as if he's Neo in the Matrix, and the supporting characters are to assume he's ""The One.""

Whether we choose to ignore the plausibility of the denouement, there's also the matter of an overabundance of super-powered mutants, each one with unique abilities. It's not that it's difficult to keep track of who is capable of what, but rather few of the talents are given much definition or screen time. In fact, the most exciting cabalistic showdown doesn't even initially involve Nick, but rather with cool Division henchman Victor, who gets to combat machinegun bullets with his bare hands. In the end, Push had plenty of potential and the setup for sequels, but the ""wow"" factor is tragically neutral. Action, special effects and flashy editing can't make us care for characters and events that seem trivial, despite crafting a world that is both fascinating and not too outlandish that it can't be explained during the opening title sequence voiceover.

By its very intricate nature, the events and circumstances in Push work to make its audience think about what they've just seen - which unfortunately brings undue attention to the numerous plot holes and nonsensical predicament resolutions our heroes face.  In the end it's more fun than not, but the film finds itself feeling more like the first part of a story rather than a standalone adventure burdened by the responsibility of introduction to an elaborate new world.

assination by agents of ""The Division"". The Division is a shady-shadowy government organization that has been doing research into
psychic-soldiers since WWII. Often FATAL, artificial, means are used to improve these capabilities.
Dakota Fanning, plays a spindly-legged 12-year-old heavy drinker (that probably should ditch the short skirt and wear PANTS!)' is led
by a drawing to find Nick (Chris Evans the adult) to get him to find a briefcase that can lead to the END of The Division.
He was walking away from Cassie/Dakota until a Bleeder gang [that also wants this briefcase] come on the scene.

To enjoy this movie---maybe THAT is why there was NO sequel to this six-year-old movie--- you need to remember the ""powers"":

A Stitcher can heal or hurt.
Shifters...can change the appearance of objects.
Sniffers...can smell personal items to obtain information.
Watchers...can see the future in their drawings.
Bleeders...shouting causes bleeding and internal damage.
Pushers....implant thoughts and change memories.
Shadows....can block out watchers and sniffers.
Loopers....[I think they] may effect other's memories.
Movers.....able to control objects without physical contact.

The stunts; CGI SF/X were very good, and I found it interesting that it was filmed in HONG KONG! One of several places I've been.

The powers are so laughably inconsistent with itself.  At every turn nothing makes sense, and when you finally have that aha moment that puts everything together you realize it still doesn't make any sense.  Thats when you know it has failed as a movie.  This movie was clearly made for 13 year old boys, as I could almost call it a legal porno.  You see more sexual innuendo from the little girl than of any other character in the entire movie.  At one point the camera is looking up her skirt.  But I gave it a 1 star because of the story.  There are just way too many plot holes for this movie to be enjoyable or make any sense.

3732444,3,B001OQCVI8,"It's not based on a comic book like his roles in Fantastic Four and Cap't A, but it's Chris Evans in another superhero movie. This time he's a telekinetic who uses his undeveloped powers mainly to affect the outcome of dice rolls he makes while gambling (which he often fails at). Eventually, he gains more control and can do some more exciting comic-booky things. The real star of Push is Dakota Fanning's precognitive character. She steals every scene she's in with her trademark old-soul-wisdom-in-a-child's-body routine. The premise of this universe is there are humans with powers and there are government agencies in charge of monitoring, regulating, and possibly eliminating them when they challenge the agency's agenda. And there's a secret that has the power to topple these government agencies, which brings together an impressive cast including Evans, Fanning, Camilla Belle, Ming-Na Wen, and Cliff Curtis. Throw in Djimon Honshou as the antagonist and you wonder why a genre flick with this cast wasn't a hit. But it didn't have the brand recognition and instant fanbase of the DC and Marvel movies. It has other problems too, but for what it is--an original sci fi superhero flick--it's not bad. Definitely better than the Fantastic 4s anyway.",1410912000,,1256,5.131707317073171

3732540,4,B001OQCVI8,"I like this movie. I admit that I had wanted to see it when it debuted in theaters, but lost track of it, so it went forgotten until the popularity of Chris Evan's skyrocketed after Captain America: Winter Solider.

It was a good movie and I like a lot of the individual pieces.  The cast is well selected.  Each person really embodies their role and portray fairly fleshed out and dimensional characters.  The story is interesting (I am not familiar with anything that would be source material) and seems to have a rich history that we are only getting a pinch of.  This fact is not a deal breaker, I don't think that not having a full understanding of the bigger picture is a problem, it's just something you have to go with the flow.  I also liked the style of the movie.  The coloring and the camera work.  It suggested a mature game of hide and seek, which is what the film is, so it definitely supported the theme.  The locations were also well chosen, random (somewhat) ambiguous Asian city.  Again, it supported the plot of the movie.

My issue with the movie is just that is seemed to be missing an element to tie the character, the story, the theme all together.  They all supported one another, and each piece did a robust job, but there was just a small motivation passed ""she told me to be here"" to make it meld together that was missing.

I will also add that for the most part this is the kind of movie that proves why all of the actors are still working.  They are really good at what they do.  Chris Evans has a quality about him that makes him both the vulnerable loner and the enigmatic Big Man on Campus.  Dakota Fanning, Ming-Na Wen, Djimon Hounsou, everyone in the first tier cast; all strong at what they do.

If you want to see an entertaining movie that has a lot of good work, regardless of this vague missing element, this one is still worth your time.",1401926400,3,1879,4.353448275862069

3732587,5,B001OQCVI8,"This movie is an odd combination of styles. Parts are filmed frenetically, and with its eclectic, often electric soundtrack it reminds me of Trainspotting. It shows as much Hong Kong as any travelogue, sometimes bustling, sometimes full of color. Dakota Fanning has precocious depth and comedic timing, and in fact her scenes are so compelling that I can't help but think of Paper Moon and The Professional. The plot is part sci-fi mystery, part heist. At times, it's like Heroes; at others, Jumpers.

If the parts combined coherently, or if there seemed to be a central theme, then this might be a great movie. As it is, I watched it twice in a row just to understand how it felt. I don't know what I got out of it. I can't put my finger on it. But I certainly enjoyed it.",1398643200,,773,4.4822695035460995

Aside from a couple action movie cliches, the storytelling was really captivating. There was a point when I really thought, ""My God! There's no way for anyone to win! How can anyone win!?"" I thought that Chris Evans and Dakota Fanning worked together splendidly in this film. Camilla Belle was pretty, but unremarkable overall.

The writers/directors made a great choice by opening the film in such a way that you really have no idea what's going on. They introduced plot points, characters, and concepts really cleverly throughout the film. Everything that didn't make sense at the beginning paints a wonderful picture by the end; confusing expository voice overs at the beginning lay a solid enough foundation to keep you engaged, but still wondering what it all means. By the end, I promise you'll be surprised by the turns this story takes.

3732681,3,B001OQCVI8,"Push Bowling for Movies Score: 140.625 of 300

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

Push - we own the Bly Ray version of this flick

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
In a reality where some people are born with special abilities (and get zippy pet names - Watchers (Clairvoyants), Movers (Telekinetics), and Pushers (those who can push thoughts into people's heads) to name just a few) - a 13 year old watcher named Cassie uses her superhuman abilities to convince a mover to help recover a mysterious case containing a mysterious drug.  They are helped along the way by a cornucopia of supers including Sniffers, Shifters, Shadowers, and Stitchers all the while being tracked down by both an Asian syndicate and an American agency known as ""Division"".  A mystery wrapped in a riddle and all painted on a Hong Kong backdrop.

Over all this movie was a mixed bag.  Nearly universally panned by critics, Push failed to capitalize on the emerging supernatural market and bombed out in the box office.  Personally I liked this little flick but there is no getting around its lack of gloss, in fact, the entire movie suffers from a bad case of low-budget-itis.  In a day and age where budgets for bread and butter films run in the $100m range, the $38m cost simply starved this production.  The special effects are far and few between, reminiscent of  movies made two decades earlier.  With that said, I thought the story concept was actually quite interesting.  Supernatural warriors battling it out amongst beautiful skyscrapers, slummy back alleys, and in swank nightclubs.  Chris Evans (of Captain America fame) did a better than expected job breathing life into Nick.  The story had real potential but basically got lost in the mix of what I am sure was meant to be fast-paced action.

What I loved:
-  Basically a good story with real potential - supernaturals battling it out in Hong Kong for a secret serum which enhances their already incredible abilities
-  Intertwining knots of storylines - a love story, mixed with action, and sprinkled with a mystery

What I did NOT like:
-  Glacial paced story which just kind of unwound as you sat back and checked the clock (often)
-  Wasted potential of a seriously interesting theme
-  Bleeders (supers who emit super high frequency screams - think of the sound you'd make when you stepped on a nail) are just annoying
-  Basically, The Little Movie that Couldn't

I bought it used and it had a scratch or two that made parts of it unviewable until I fixed the scratches. Apparently it wasn't all that engrossing because I fell asleep the first time I watched it. Try to get someone to explain this mad world in the movie - maybe if you can understand all the mutant types it makes more sense. To me it seemed like someone was trying to make a matrix-style futuristic movie, without the matrix.

Girl tries to help a guy with mutant powers who is just trying to hide out and survive, but she ends up putting him on the run. Mutant hunters attack; mutants attack. wierdness happens and I managed to fall asleep again. Sorry, just not impressed with this one.",1371686400,,774,4.301369863013699

3732710,4,B001OQCVI8,"This movie is of course fiction, but as acknowledged it is inspired by reality. The military has long been interested in extrasensory perception (ESP), the most wellknown result of this interest was the Star Gate program (a good account about this is given in:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reading-the-Enemy-s-Mind-Inside-Star-Gate-America-s-Psychic-Espionage-Program/dp/0312875150/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reading the Enemy's Mind: Inside Star Gate: America's Psychic Espionage Program</a>). However reality did not appear to be strange or scary enough for the film-makers and the movie is thus more the result of their creativity than research. I do not complain about this and really enjoyed the movie despite the (as usual) sometimes very apparent contrast between for example psychokinesis (PK) in parapsychological experiments and in the movie. The latter really portrays a kind of nightmare version of ESP and PK. That said, if one studies folklore one will come across accounts of mind control by cunning folk, who force thieves to return stolen goods - fear of this and thought reading, PK etc. (i.e. fear of psi) are quite rarely acknowledged. It is an entertaining action movie with good actors, Dakota Fanning in particular did a really good job.",1369180800,2,1306,5.989304812834225

Still the execution of the idea was done pretty well with the story taking place all over a very gritty Hong Kong.  It had the feel of a blend between Firestarter, and the TV series Alphas and Mutant-X, with a little bit of Blade Runner thrown in.  Sure there were some holes in the plot, but not enough to distract from the story too much.  The action sequences made up for it and I found it a very entertaining and fun Sci-Fi to watch that was far above a B Sci-Fy channel work but a bit below more main stream high budget sci-fi flicks.",1365033600,2,672,4.344

3732815,1,B001OQCVI8,"Push is such a bad film, I don't know where to begin! What troubled me most was is the ""Kill or Be Killed - On Steroids,"" is the main message you got from watching this depraved film. It does not have an ounce of charm, humor or heart! It's like watching someone's nightmare in slow motion! It's a black and white world where the color ""gray"" has never been invented! You could also classify Push as a war-porn type film pandering to those who like watching the body count rise!

The writers of Push are so desperate for you to notice at least one main character they had to exploit a 13-year old girl by constantly showing off her long, spindly legs. Keeping in mind this is a film made for adults, and not teens, I felt that was very inappropriate! Making her cry about her fear of dying was also sad to watch. But she's certainly the only character in this film anyone is going to care about.

For the life of me, I don't understand why Hollywood constantly pumps out really bad films like Push. It give the whole fantasy genre a bad name! How can that possibly be good for business?

3732817,3,B001OQCVI8,"Push(released Feb/09)stars Dakota Fanning as Cassie,Chris Evans as Nick Gant,Djimon Hounsou as Agent Henry Carver,Cliff Curtis(Cliff is a busy New Zealand actor I recall from Hercules/Xena and the Live Free and Die Hard movie) as Hook Waters and others. This is a grand mish mash of ideas which just has too much on its plate. Its whole is not the sum of its parts.
The plot involves a whole slew of different types of psychic characters such as Pushers,Stitchers,Watchers,Wipers,Shadows,Bleeders,Sniffers,Shifters and Movers....and bears,oh my!
The film opens in Hong Kong and two Movers,a son and his father,are under siege from the Division. The father is a powerful entity that the Division wants back. The father saves his son by sending him away and he is killed by the Division chief Carver. In fact it is Carver who is front and center throughout most of the film hunting down his son,Cassie,a Watcher who his father told him would come to help one day,and others they interact with. The scene switches from the past to the present and Cassie arrives on the scene to assist Nick. An ex girlfriend of Nicks shows up and she has escaped from the Division,after having been injected with a powerful serum designed to boost her psychic abilities. She was the only one to have successfully survived the injection. Her mother is still being held by the Division,but she planted a case with the serum in a secret location. Cassie and Nick find the case,but a local Hong Kong gang with its own psychic individuals,along with Carver from the Division,also want the serum.
After Cassie and Nick retrieve the case,Nick comes up with a scheme to write notes to each of their party,who must not open them up until later. In the meantime Nick gets a mind swipe so he cannot recall the events of the last two hours,so if he is caught his mind cannot be gleaned for any info. There are numerous psychic battles fought between different factions,but in the end Carver gets the serum and Nicks girlfriend. On the plane ride back to the U.S.,the girlfriend opens up the letter given to her by Nick and its says to kill Carver. The film ends as a gun shot goes off.
While watching this I found myself,more often than not,trying to recall what type of psychic abilities this character had,or that;there are just so many. And also what each type actually did,powers wise. Some were kind of self explanatory,but others like Pushers,Bleeders and Movers were a bit too abstract to comprehend right off. Another draw back was that the movie rarely let one stop to breath,to take in everything the movie was throwing at you. If you got it fine,if you didn't,tough luck. It was information overload to the max. The movies concept was certainly different,but done in such a non-conducive style.
Technically speaking the film is in a w/s a/r of 2:35:1,and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,deleted scenes and a featurette.
All in all a movie with far too much going on and with a terribly relentless pace to it. The acting is good but the story is info overload,to the max. 2 1/2 -3 stars.",1348963200,,3079,4.778611632270169

The acting was great, I don't know where the ""horrible acting"" stuff is coming from but Chris Evans and Dakota Fanning did great, as well as the others. Another great thing about this movie was the music they chose for each scene. They did a great job at portraying what emotions were going on. One thing about the ending, I know a lot of my friends didn't really like it, and said they need a squeal with that kind of ending but I think it concludes perfectly for what this story was about, not everything needs to end the normal way.

Yes, it's been done, and been done better. Still, this represents a fair specimen of its sort.

On the positive side, Dakota Fanning does a fair job as knobby-kneed and smart-mouthed tweenage character. The movie plays by its own rules, too, it doesn't just keep inventing more magic every time the plot droops. Action keeps the movie moving, right on up to the big dramatic scene at the end. And, although I generally found the effects to be effective, the actors really pulled the story along, not just the hope of some really cool visuals in the next scene.

I doubt that I'll remember much detail a week from now, or much want to. No matter, this makes a fair evening's entertainment, with near-zero nudity and reasonably restrained gore. Maybe you could do better than see this movie, but you could do worse, too.

These protagonists are not the expertly trained, they are hiding, on the run, avoiding slavery, death, or worse at the hands of the Division for the sin of having been born with powers. What they lack in education must be made up in motivation and dedication.

3732878,5,B001OQCVI8,"This movie has received a lot of criticism, but I truly loved the entire experience.  I'm not going to discuss the plot in detail, as I know that has been done numerous times already, however I'll touch on some of the key areas I enjoyed.

The premise is inspired by Project Stargate (The Men Who Stare At Goats), a CIA sponsored program to create psychic super soldiers, particularly with ""Watchers"" being inspired by Remote Viewers.  Perhaps my enjoyment of the movie stems from my preexisting fascination with the topic of Remote Viewing as well as comic book lore.

One reoccurring criticism was that the movie was basically Heroes the TV series.  This is completely untrue.  The only similarities in plot are that both shows feature superheroes without costumes.  The average person with super power angle is not new to either Heroes or Push.  Neither is the lack of costumes.  In Push the characters have far more mundane powers when compared to some of the Heroes characters.  Basically, only idiots who aren't familiar with comic lore outside of movies and TV see these plots as being extremely parallel.  The super heroes fighting a shadowy government agency who wants to weaponize them is not original to either plot either.  That theme has been around pretty much as long as comic books have.

I enjoyed the mundane nature of super powers as explained above quite a bit.  I also loved that the Watchers (Dakota Fanning) in this movie couldn't predict the future easily, that their actions kept changing it, and that it required ""human intention"" to predict that future.  This is taken directly from Project Stargate, and is true of modern Remote Viewing programs.  I hope people don't find the plot as complicated with this knowledge in advance.

The Watchers are the only angle of true ""powers"" taken from declassified documents that I'm aware of.  The other powers are exaggerated or entirely made-up from legends.  Don't expect any Superman or Green Lantern types in this story.

Another common criticism is that the character development was too shallow; or too many underdeveloped characters.  I cannot argue that this is the case, however this plot was clearly not written as a stand-alone story.  There is a comic series prequel from DC Comics on these characters, and the story was meant to be an introduction to a longer plot.  The story is being made into a TV series presently.",1315872000,,2399,4.898263027295285
3732879,4,B001OQCVI8,"My family has watched this movie half a dozen times and we always enjoy it. The young adults portrayed in the story have various paranormal powers: movers (telekinetic), watchers (see the future), shades (hide people and objects from the watchers), shifters (temporarily change paper into money, soy sauce into medicine, etc.)

The setting is Hong Kong, so the backdrop is exotic and lush. At the core it's good vs. evil, freedom vs. government control.  It's fun to root for the underdogs as they outwit an asian gang (with similar powers) and the government agency know as ""Division.""

The asian gang fights with lethal screamers who kill with sound.  They're annoying but funny because you have to wonder how the actors who played those parts have been able to get other jobs after something like this. One of our favorite parts is the fight scene between two movers; the special effects (rainbow impacts and sound reverbs) are great.

3732915,3,B001OQCVI8,"Continuing the tradition of movies that are gritty interpretations of the superheroe genre, Push neatly divides superpowers into categories: watchers, movers, pushers, bleeders, sniffers, shifters, wipers, shadows, and stitches. The U.S. government tests a superhero augmentation drug on a pusher - Kira (Camilla Belle) -- and instead of killing her like all the previous subjects, it makes her nigh-unstoppable. Syringe in hand, Kira escapes to Hong Kong.

Switch to Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), a walking deus ex machine who stumbles into Mover Nick's (Chris Evans) life trying to live off the grid.  She's a Watcher who can see the future.  Reminiscent of Minority Report, life with a Watcher is like eavesdropping on the script writer. Cassie drags Chris through the rest of the plot, which she sketches out in cartoon form on a chalkboard. In truth, they're just characters in an even larger story crafted by an earlier Watcher, Cassie's mother.

What ensues is a cat-and-mouse-and-also-cat game between U.S. Division agents, led by Pusher Agent Carver (Djimon Hounsou) and Chinese Triads, led by a family of Bleeders. Push takes place entirely within Hong Kong, which is interesting at first but quickly becomes repetitive.

Push has a challenge in quickly identifying all the different types of superpowers and how they interact.  Like so many complicated plots of this type, the success of the story hinges entirely on the audience's patience. There's a complicated chess game in how the powers trump each other, Watcher vs. Pusher, Sniffer vs. Wiper. Keeping track requires an investment in the characters, but there are so many that it's hard to care about any of them.

The heart of the movie is the relationship - or lack thereof - between Kira and Chris. Is it real?  Is it an implanted memory?  Are they together because they should be, or because the Watchers believe they should be? And how do you outwit a foe who knows what you're going to do before you do it?

SPOILERS: The answer seems to be to not know what you're doing.  Chris' solution is to have a Wiper wipe his memory, distribute envelopes to his superpowered friends, and thereby make the plan impossible to detect. There's no real reason why this should work, as Watchers aren't mind readers, they're clairvoyant seers - they see a theoretical objective future, not the future a person believes will happen.

And that's the thing. Push wants to be Memento with superpowers, but Chris' brilliant plan isn't all that brilliant.  The ending aims for shock but comes off a little too smug - the sound of a gunshot is a nice exclamation point to Push's run-on sentence, but it makes for a very short plane ride.",1296518400,3,2689,4.9621380846325165

3732917,3,B001OQCVI8,"Director Paul McGuigan's Push (2009), is all about people with various paranormal abilities, who are involved in a strange, tense, adventure set in Hong Kong.  The viewer is very quickly drawn into this uniquely dark world, and taken on an unconventional journey.  The plot may be hard to follow at times, and if you lose a thread, it is easy to get confused.  It may take repeated viewings, but when you put the pieces together, there is a story that holds together fairly well.

The film has its own language, mostly consisting of slang terms for those with various abilities.  ""Watchers"" to some degree, can see into the future, and manifest their visions though drawings.  ""Movers"" have telekinetic ability, and can create force fields powerful enough to deflect bullets.  ""Pushers"" have the ability to implant thoughts and memories into someone else's mind.  ""Shifters"" have the ability to temporarily alter the physical appearance of matter, while ""sniffers"" can gather data by touching objects.  A ""bleeder's"" piercing scream can make your ears bleed and even kill, while ""shadows"" can cloud the power of a sniffer or watcher.  ""Stitchers"" can heal or hurt by touch, and ""wipers"" have the ability to wipe out certain memories.

Perennial fictional fall guys the Nazis, first instituted a program to find a way to use those with paranormal abilities as weapons.  Other agencies continued the mission until present times, where the US Government's ""Division"" is working on a drug to enhance paranormal powers.  All previous test subjects have died, until Kira (Camilla Belle) a pusher, survives and escapes the government's test facility with a syringe of the drug.  Agent Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) leads the Division in the attempt to recapture Kira.

In Hong Kong, thirteen year old watcher Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), contacts Nick (Chris Evans), a mover with underdeveloped powers.  Cassie is trying to find a way to free her mother, who is being held by Division, and believes that Nick can help.  The pair enlist shifter Hook Waters (Cliff Curtis), and sniffer Emily Hu (Ming Na), to help locate Kira, who has had her memory wiped, and can't remember where she has hidden a suitcase containing the syringe.  Also in the picture, are a Triad gang led by family members with paranormal powers, and guided by watcher Pop Girl (Xiao Lu Li), the daughter of the head of the gang.  The Triads want the formula, and pursue Cassie and Nick, to try and locate Kira.  Cassie and Pop Girl constantly tangle, while Nick is challenged by Victor (Neil Jackson) another mover working for Division.  The film features a major battle near the end, where Nick is caught in a crossfire between Division and the Triads, while also Kira exercises her powers to the fullest.

Sorting out the parameters of this special world, and learning what the different paranormals can do, takes a little time and effort.  The special abilities are comparable to super powers.  With most everything in a fantasy context, the story seems to flow in a manner that mostly makes sense, although there are points with odd plot jumps.  Driven by the central story, the film features some cool action scenes and special effects.  Shot in Hong Kong, the film nicely features some distinctive and colorful locations, although capturing little of the flavor of the people and culture.  Push is a weird atmospheric ride with a dark tone, where the characters remain human, without drifting into pretentious superhero type behavior.  The acting is generally solid, with Fanning, Evans, and Hounsou, probably standing out the most.  The ending may not entirely satisfy, as some matters are left hanging.  What really matters is the enhancing drug, and Division still has total control over it, so any victory by the gifted would appear to be rather limited, providing the opportunity for a sequel.  A commentary by director Paul McGuigan (Lucky Number Slevin), and stars Dakota Fanning and Chris Evans, is lively and fun, though as you might expect, not particularly informative technically.",1293926400,,4063,5.04647676161919
3732918,4,B001OQCVI8,"Overview:

This movie starts 10 years in the past, where Nick Grant (Colin Ford as a youth and Chris Evans as an adult) is a young teenager. His dad is killed by agents of the Division. As the story goes, the Division is a shadowy government organization that has continued doing research into the development of soldiers with psychic capabilities. This research was started in Nazi Germany in 1945 and has secretly continued since then. Radiation is used to improve these capabilities, however, the survival rate after the treatment has not been good.

In order to understand this movie, you need to be aware of the major categories of the different psychics and their capabilities:

- Watchers : able to see future events, demonstrated by drawings;
- Movers: able to control objects without physical contact;
- Pushers: able to implant thoughts and change memories;
- Shifters: these persons can change the appearance of objects;
- Sniffers: smell objects and personal effects to obtain associated info;
- Stitchers: these have healing and hurting capabilities;
- Bleeders: these by shouting can cause bleeding and internal damage;

[Other categories include: Loopers and Shadows no explaination is given for these.]

Storyline:

Cassie Holms (Dakota Fanning) is led by a drawing to find Nick and to get his help to find a briefcase that can lead to the Division's undoing. Initially, he is prepared to walk away from Cassie until a Chinese Bleeder gang who also wants to get their hands on this briefcase come into the picture. From there on in it is a 3-way toss up for who will end up with this prized briefcase.

The Cinematic Experience:

There is a kind of X-men feel to this movie, however, the capabilities are more well defined and the competing parties are more evenly matched. The special effects are very well done, especially when the movers are in action. The gun work is quite unusual, there is no bullet time, but the various opponents use temporary 'mover shields'. There are extra elements of uncertainty added as Nick and Cassie try to mislead other watchers.

Conclusion:

This is an excellent thriller/action film, while some may say that it is not too original, I find that there is enough new material so that it cannot be labeled as a knock off.",1292976000,58,2271,4.890625
3732919,2,B001OQCVI8,"The movie is based on various ideas appropriated (without acknowledgment) from Philip Dick's novels.  This much it shares with recent Inception, but is less coherent.

3732920,2,B001OQCVI8,"I really wanted to like Push (2009) more than I did. The concept sounded cool and I thought it might be in the vain of Jumper (2008), a movie I really love and have come to appreciate even more with subsequent viewings. But the ""movie magic"" just didn't come together on Push like it did on Jumper. I give Push 2.5 stars out of 5. And one of those stars is purely for the incredible visuals this film has, making it worth at least a single viewing. I'm not going to try and summarize the plot of this film, because it's a little too jumbled and complicated...and honestly, the film just isn't worth it to me. One of the key problems with this film is the real lack of a story and plot. It's got all the cool elements needed for a great story, but it doesn't put them to effective use. Just read Roger Ebert's review to see what I'm saying. There's no real character development that helps us understand and relate to the characters emotionally. I think Chris Evans is probably miscast in the leading role of this film. He just doesn't have the depth yet to really be a leading man in a film with this kind of complex concept. And he doesn't gel with the supporting characters in this film, played by Dakota Fanning, Camilla Belle, and Djimon Hounsou.

The reasons to watch this film at least once are simple: production design and photography. This film looks incredible. It was shot entirely in Hong Kong, and the interesting mix of architecture and Asian culture is fascinating and colorful to see. I was just blown away at times by some of the sets and locations. Production Designer Francois Seguin really showcased his talents on this film, finding quirky and challenging things for Director of Photography Peter Sova to light and photograph. The cinematography is incredible, both in its use of interesting camera angles and positions, and for it's incredibly colorful palette. I can't remember seeing primary colors like red and yellow in such startling use on a film. It definitely showcases the Asian culture in which the film takes place. I felt like I was transported out of America for 2 hours and dropped right into the hustle-and-bustle of Hong Kong, China.

I wish could offer something more about this film, but it just didn't have anything more to offer in my opinion. Push is worth watching once, just to see what it might bring to the production design of your dreams. I certainly will never forget the look and feel of this film.",1292112000,,2449,4.60183066361556

I love that it was set in China, as I have been studying quite a bit about China in college, including their language. I also liked that their individual powers reminded me of a novel I had been working on in the past. Another factor was the soundtrack, which I absolutely loved. The most important thing in this film was the seriousness, because I absolutely hate films that make a joke of things (comedies are my least favorite genre, next to country-western themes). I have this film on BluRay, and recently purchased it on iTunes as well, so that I could watch it while traveling. This story of the movie was written well, with the plot leading up to a climax where events unfold quickly and separate characters become interestingly intertwined.

3732923,3,B001OQCVI8,"I felt ""Push"" was a good action flick that needed some more ingredients that was missing from it, that
the movie script could have been developed alittle more deeper the way Hideki Kamiya, director to the legendary
""Devil May Cry"" the original and now ""Bayonetta"" did. Push needs it's legendary script writer and director. I
gave this movie three stars because of it's lack of in-depth powers and a undeveloped script. For example,
CyberConnect 2's ""Hiroshi Matsuyama,"" President/CEO of CyberConnect2 came out with ""Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm,""
about 2 years ago; anyway the game did good but it could have done better? Well, this year, he saw the flaws his game
was suffering from, like the naruto world, it barely had people walking about in the leaf village. The Leaf village
was completely dead full of boring with no signs of life? Now that Hiroshi Matsuyama sees these problems, he's given
""Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2"" along with his developers and script writers the ingredients to make this years game waaaayyyy,
waaaayyyy better. Flaws are finally corrected with a cherry on top. Well ""Push"" needs that type of director, script writer
with an eye and a more open-mind to bring this movie to life, the way James Cameron did with ""Avatar."" I felt Push was rushed
in certain areas of the movie with weak areas that needed tobe develope without rush.

But don't get me wrong, I like ""Push,"" I loved Dakota Fanning's acting, But Chris Evan and Camilla Belle was not clicking in this
movie. How many movies did Camilla Belle star in with less lines to say, my god! And Chris Evans was just p***y wipped in this movie,
that it exposed his weakness for a** that he could not stay focus. Dakota Fanning is a much better actor all-around, she needs more
like her to make a dream team for more hit movies like ""Twilight New Moon"" and ""Twilight Eclipse."" I give ""Push"" three stars.",1286668800,,1882,4.737804878048781
3732944,4,B001OQCVI8,"This was a really good movie.  It kept my attention til the very end.  If you like tv shows like Heros, this has a strong resemblance.  Very good story line.",1282608000,,157,4.166666666666667
3732945,3,B001OQCVI8,"""Push"" (2009) is a relatively large budget action-adventure/sci-fi film that is neither as good nor as bad as most of these comments indicate. It is basically a blend of ""Bladerunner"" (1982) and ""Dark Angel"" (2002), without the futuristic and original production design; instead they use lots of Hong Kong street scenes and establishment shots, these are just off-kilter enough to give the thing a foreign or futuristic feel.

It is also a chase-film/buddy-picture. The premise is that Nazi experiments during WWII identified individuals with certain psychic abilities and the descendants of these people are now walking among us; either aligned with or hiding from a governmental organization called ""The Division"". The government is conducting deadly experiments to find a way to enhance these abilities for military purposes.

This simplistic concept is expanded into a feature length film by introducing classifications for each type of ability; but only one to a customer. So we learn that there are ""watchers,"" who can draw pictures the future; ""sniffers,"" human hound dogs who can sniff an object the person has touched and track them; ""movers,"" who can move objects with their minds; ""bleeders,"" whose screams shatter glass and ear drums; ""wipers,"" who can erase portions of someone's memory; ""stitchers,"" who can heal; ""shadows,"" who can cloak people from ""sniffers"" and confuse ""watchers""; and ""pushers"" (see title) who can plant controlling memories and motivate someone to take certain actions.

The fatal flaw is in the script, which attempts to make the story a mental challenge by going all ""Ipcress File"" (1965) in its plot convolutions. At the end you are supposed to sort through the Hitchcock MacGuffin's and think how cleverly they fooled you. But all they really did was keep you in a state of dazed confusion because you didn't know enough about the potentials and the constraints of the psychic abilities for you to have anticipated much of anything. This means almost every development in the story is its own little ""deux ex machina"" moment; ""a plot device whereby a seemingly inextricable problem is suddenly and abruptly solved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new character, ability, or object"".

The other flaw is the substitution of talent-challenged pretty people like Chris Evans and Camilla Belle for actors. This is compounded by placing them in scenes with Dakota Fanning whose obvious talent tends to draw attention to the lameness of the rest of the ensemble. The only exception being Fanning's scenes with Chinese ""actress"" Xiaolu Li, of ""Rainbow"" (2005) fame, which are refreshingly well done as she and Fanning are the only cast members that grasp the concept of acting for the camera and selling their characters.

""Push"" is quite average and only a must see for those really into the concept of a talking killer (a la James Bond). Never have more people pointed more guns at more heads and said more words without anyone getting shot. And the ""movers"" can point their guns without holding them. Big Wow!

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1281744000,,3114,5.1200787401574805
3732946,5,B001OQCVI8,"In the world of Push, paranormal individuals exist with various powers - clairvoyance, telekinesis, etc. - who are sought by national governments and other organizations, all for their own purposes.  Sound familiar?  In a way it is, but it would in that case fall into that class of movies that takes an idea that's done all the time, but then just does it noticeably better than most of its peers.  But Push has been made different by a very distinctive style and an edgier, slightly darker vibe.  The lines between good and evil among the governments, criminal empires, etc. that are pursuing the superpowered fugitives around the world - and have been for decades - are blurred and it appears there really are no 'good guys' among the big organized players.  Instead the heroes of the movie are the fugitives, who just want to avoid being captured and used.  The edgier vibe comes into play here - although the powered beings are generally the 'good guys', they often live on the wrong side of the law (by necessity), often have shady connections, and most of them won't hesitate to use lethal force against their pursuers.

  One of the main objectives of the government agency known as Division (with Djimon Hounsou turning in another terrific performance as one of their top agents) over the years, aside from hunting down the 'movers' (telekinetics), 'watchers' (clairvoyants), 'pushers' (can 'push' their thoughts into others' minds and influence their behavior), 'screamers' (dangerous 'shockwave' type screams) and all the other paranormals, has been finding a safe means of enhancing the powers of these individuals.  Over the years, numerous drugs have been devised that can temporarily raise power levels enormously, but it always manifests fatal side effects shortly thereafter.  The apparant success of the use of a new drug on a captive pusher named Kira (Camilla Belle from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-a-Stranger-Calls/dp/B000F6IOAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When a Stranger Calls</a>) is the catalyst for the events of the movie.  Kira escapes Division's custody, aided by the use of her rapidly increasing mental powers, and ends up in Hong Kong, allied with a mover, Nick (Chris Evans) who's been on the run since he saw his mover father killed by Division agents when he was eight, and a young clairvoyant named Cassie (Dakota Fanning).  Alliances switch and turn as competing organizations seek Kira and the drug that enhanced her, and powered individuals get dragged into the fray on various sides.  It also comes in that not everyone's intentions may be what they initially seem, and in some cases the viewer is left to decide on their own who to root for rather than being told ""here's the bad guys, and here's the good guys"".

  Push balances a complex and smart storyline with mystery/suspense angles on one side and dynamic action on the other.  The characterizations are strong, the production values great, and the unusual pounding electronic score helps Push to create a unique atmosphere.  Intriguing, sexy, and with fast-paced plot twists that call for the viewer to pay close attention, this is a definate winner in the superpowered action/adventure field, with TONNES of potential for a sequel to boot.  9/10",1277769600,2,3296,5.230038022813688

4. The pusher (kira) - The girl who defines a pleasant day through the morgue. Dead pan face and errr.. what exactly was her role again?

3733014,3,B001OQCVI8,"A group of people with paranormal powers fights the ""Division,"" a government agency that attempts to use their superhuman abilities for their own military purposes. ""Push"" directed by Paul McGuigan (""Lucky Number Slevin"") is a sci-fi action/thriller that begins with the familiar, but pretty interesting premises. You know, there are ""movers"" ""watchers"" ""sniffers"" and ""pushers."" You may think this sounds a bit like an extended episode from the TV series ""Heroes."" Maybe you are right. It is just ""Push"" needs a better story.

In ""Push"" Chris Evans plays Nick, a ""mover"" living in Hong Kong, who can move objects (not much, though, for now) without touching them. Two agents sent from the ""Division"" visit him, looking for a woman Kira (Camilla Belle), who recently escaped from their facilities. Nick knows nothing about her, for now. Honestly.

Then, a strange girl named Cassie (Dakota Fanning) barges into his room. Cassie is a ""watcher"" who can see the future (she actually draws, just like one character in ""Heroes."") And Cassie warns him of the impending danger - in this case, death.

I'm not particularly against borrowing ideas from other movies, but ""Push"" does it so many times and, moreover, not in the smartest way. In spite of some nice ideas (like Cliff Curtis' ""shifter""), ""Push"" is not involving as it should be. The film needs a storyline. It seems ""Push"" has got caught up in following the rules of the underworld and the back stories of characters. The story is there; it's just too convoluting to follow. The characters are there (and some are interesting, as I said); it seems they actually don't know what they really want to do, just like the film itself.

Other super psychics join in to help in the cause to take down Division. To complicate matters a Chinese syndicate is also after the drug filled syringe. For those of you who have been to Hong Kong as I have you will love the street scenes of the Chinese merchants, boats and restaurants.

Chris Evans is the Mover, Dakota Fanning the Watcher - and together they go in search of a Pusher named Kira (Camilla Belle), who is the first such person to survive an injection given to her by a nefarious government agency to artificially pump up the ""freaks""' super abilities and create an invincible army out of them in the process.  Or at least that's what I THINK the movie was about because, quite frankly, if you can figure out what is going on in this film for more than five minutes at a stretch, you are a more astute observer of these things than I am.  At any rate, despite her weakened condition, Kira has somehow managed to escape her captors, and thus the race is on to see whether the heroes or the villains will get to her first.  I guess this gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""going after pushers.""

3733022,4,B001OQCVI8,"Just finished watching the movie ""Push"" it was a conventional, predictable but pretty entertaining flick about people who have psychic superpowers of sorts that range from controlling people's minds to moving objects with their mind to being able to see the future among other things.

The story is pretty basic, Nick Grant (Chris Evans ""Fantastic Four"", ""Sunshine"") is recruited by Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning, ""I Am Sam"" ""War of the Worlds"") to find a girl and a case that holds the key to bringing down an evil government group called the Division. Nick can move objects with his mind and Cassie is a watcher who can see the future. The girl is named Kira (Camilla Belle, ""When A Stranger Calls"", ""10,000 B.C."") and she has the ability to control people's minds but just looking into their eyes. The head of division is played by Djimon Hounsou (""Amistad"" ""Gladiator"").

The case holds a drug that Kira stole when she broke out of division's headquarters. The drug is supposed to enhance people's powers but no one survived the injection until Kira and now the division is out to bring her and the drug back. There's more to the story but that's basically the meat of it.

There are of course numerous side characters with plenty of oriental stereotypes, and Ming-Na (T.V.'s ""ER"") has a small role in it. Cliff Curtis (""True Lies"" ""Sunshine"") also has a small role as a con artist with what u might say are powers of persuasion.

The best acting to me was done by Hounsou, I've always thought he's a great under rated actor who can play both a perfect good guy but really plays a great villain. Fanning and Evans are decent, nothing bad to say there, but Belle is kinda the weak link. She's great looking no question there, but putting her in any role where she has to try and act doesn't really work too well.

There are some pretty entertaining albeit somewhat goofy action sequences with numerous displays of various peoples powers, even some oriental guys who can shatter glass and people's ear drums by screaming. The action is quick paced as is the story and while there isn't a lot of depth to the movie and it's excessively predictable in every way, overall it's an entertaining experience. 3 out of 4 stars.",1253664000,,2221,4.684615384615385

There are special people amongst us, people with special powers. Some are referred to as movers or those with telekinetic ability. Pushers are those with telepathic abilities and also watchers who can see the future and the list goes on. As is the case whenever there is something special there are those who seek to control and use. The Nazi's started experimenting in WWII and other governments picked up where they left off. These groups are referred to as Divisions. The divisions round up those with powers and attempt to increase there power in hopes of creating an army.

She and Nick (Chris Evans)must find a mystery girl and a case they believe to be in her posession if they want to change the future...

I actually had pretty low expectations for this movie but to be honest it was pretty decent. Smart casting and cinematography is part of what makes this stand out and gives it a unique flavor.

The Good: As stated not bringing huge ""Names"" to fill the roles in this was a smart choice. Granted all the actors have had some prominent roles such as Chris Evans as Johnny Storm in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JNTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four (Widescreen Edition)</a>"" but none to my knowledge have had the lead role in this type of movie. The movie also varied from other hero type movies with its cinematography. The movie doesn't have that highly polished look that is common in this type of movie giving it a somewhat gritty, dirty look which worked. The combination of these along with an interesting and complex story made for an entertaining watch.

The Bad: The story is complex and unravels quickly and some may find themselves lost and wondering how it all came together. I found that any lingering questions can be answered with a second viewing if you enjoyed it enough for that.

3733038,2,B001OQCVI8,"Push is a fantasy/sci-fi action/adventure tale about a world in which psychics of various varieties exist. There are Watchers who can see the future, telekenetic Movers, healing Stitchers, mind-controlling Pushers and a host of others. A US government agency called The Division seeks to control these psychics and harness their powers for its own ends. The Division has developed program to develop a drug that radically enhances psychic powers, but unfortunately kills almost all of its test subjects, until one girl, a mind-controlling Pusher, survives the process. She escapes, along with a sample of the drug, and The Division begins an all-out manhunt to bring her and the drug back.

While this is all a somewhat promising scenario, Push suffers from fundamental flaws in storytelling, flaws that unfortunately afflict many effects-heavy action pictures. There is shallow character development, a confusing and complicated story, awkward dialogue and gaping plot holes you could drive a truck through. There are some entertaining set pieces and Dakota Fanning is always good, even in the borderline annoying teenager she plays here. At the end of the day though, the characters are weakly rendered and there is a confusing and illogical flow to the way events play out. Frustrating for a film that could have been much better, considering the interesting backdrop they created.

3733073,4,B001OQCVI8,"I hadn't decided whether to see Push or not until I watched a trailer on another DVD, and the trailer looked great.  So I bought the movie.  Now, having watched it, I feel it's pretty good, but not great.  I'd actually rate it 3 1/2 stars if I could.

The set-up is pretty cool.  It's basically about low budget X-Men and their fight against the powers-that-be, who are being led by an 'evil' mutant.
The main character is the typical brooding, beaten down kind of character who clings to a sort of nihilistic humor to get him through the dreary days.  He meets up with a manic / depressive young mutie girl who wants to save the world and her own mother, a supposedly super-powered mutant, who the bad guys have under wraps.
It all kind of unfolds how you'd expect it to.  Throw in a twist here and there, and a handful of cool (but low budget) fight scenes and go from there.  The big climactic battle is basically a fist fight with a few lens flare effects thrown in for good measure.  Oh, and then there's the destruction of this giant bamboo box which had been hanging directly overhead, for whatever reason.  Bamboo is cheap, especially in Hong Kong, where the film is set.  That probably explains it.

The end is sort of a non-ending, in that it's a fade to black cop out.  Yes, we all know what happened and why, but it might've had more impact if it had been filmed, or changed.  Maybe have the bad guy walk out of the plane in mid-flight.  Why not?

Not a bad movie at all, but very indy in how it's filmed, camera set-ups, musical score, etc.  I expected something . . . bigger . . . after watching the trailer.",1252454400,,1622,4.3003300330033
3733074,3,B001OQCVI8,"The strongest feeling I had after watching this movie is, that it should have been better.  It has a great premise - a group of young men and women with extraordinary powers running away from a mysterious government division.  But the whole film seems to run amok, with the plot being more convoluted that it should be and the action and pacing hard to follow.  It's also set in an exotic locale, which can be appealing to a lot of viewers, but the depiction of Hong Kong comes up short:  settings like a food market, plus a group of gangsters (they really possess superpowers) seemed a little pat.

The cast seemed at first a little teeny boppy from the DVD box, but they are actually fine.  The ending is pretty good also, with a little surprise revelation.  It also sets the movie up for a sequel, which might be OK if they can figure out a way to tell the story without confusing viewers.",1252368000,,892,4.402439024390244

3733078,2,B001OQCVI8,"The ordinary-people-with-super-ability genre is becoming a bit crowded these days.  Push is the latest addition, and it seems determined to draw us in to this world enough to spawn a franchise.  A respectable cast and interesting idea have been thrown together - this is a world where experimentation into enhancing psychic abilities has led to a group of people in the world who can use their mind to either move items, change their shape, or see the future, as well as various other interesting talents.  `Division' is the government's attempt to use and develop these gifted people, and represents the bad guy.  The story requires you to stay on your toes to keep up, involving Division's hunt for a runaway `pusher' (she can push thoughts into your mind and make you believe them) and her friends who are trying to save her (Chris Evans and Dakota Fanning).  It's all set in Hong Kong, giving everything an interesting look and atmosphere, and providing the other element, the local family of psychics (the screamers are quite interesting..) who want the girl too.  To say more would spoil the plot in case you do decide to persevere.  I wanted to like this - I like the concept, like the locations.. but somehow it just failed to make me care much, and while the ideas of the psychic abilities are explored a little, it is only at the expense of our characters who might show a range of emotion, but never become anything more than two dimensional ciphers to further the machinations of the plot.
What really lets the film down, downgrading it from a popcorn-chewing-watchable 3 stars to a 2 stars, is a let-down ending.  Rarely have filmmakers been quite so blatantly left everything hanging for a sequel.. the last time I remember was Jumper - and what happened to that franchise.  Probably that's a good benchmark - if you liked Jumper and did not mind the ending, then you may well like this.
In the end, the film strives so hard to become a franchise, that it forgets to stand on its own two feet.  Memorable in places, but the sum is ultimately less than the parts.",1252022400,2,2076,4.663013698630137
3733079,4,B001OQCVI8,"People, this movie isn't that bad!

First of all, it's definitely a movie that you don't get right away (or even understand for that matter).  It took me 5 viewings to take it all in.  Now, granted, the producers and writers could have done a more fluid job presenting key plot points.  It did indeed seem at times that 16 different integral plot points were being told in a 5 minute window.

It's hard not to defend it though.  For one thing, I'm a big fan of Dakota Fanning.  It's so refreshing to see an actress from Generation Y(who is not particularly good-looking in a conventional way) showing wisdom and grace in her acting repertoire, something not seen in many child actors since Jodie Foster or to a lesser extent Drew Barrymore or Macaulay Culkin.  Fans of Dakota Fanning will love this movie especially if you liked her in her action/thriller roles (Man on Fire, Hide & Seek, War of the Worlds).

Chris Evans does well to move on from his Fantastic Four fanfare (I love alliteration) to become a solid likable male lead in Push.

Camilla Belle also does well as the adult female lead.  Although her character isn't as engaging as Dakota's, she plays it well.

What Djimon Hounsou brings to the table as an antagonist is super-villainy and a strange realism at the same time in an otherwise total fantasy world that this movie has created.

Cliff Curtis from NBC's Trauma is a very underrated actor and brought a lot of substance to the movie.  He easily becomes one of the more interesting characters despite being a supporting actor.

Neil Davidge who produced some albums for trip-hop group Massive Attack does an inventive score in the movie which I particularly enjoyed and Paul McGuigan has good directing instincts.  So I admit it, the people involved in the movie most likely drove it to be what it is commercially (Heck, the movie barely exceeded the budget in gross revenue).  If you didn't like any of the actors, you probably hated it.  But it's worth seeing if you are open-minded enough and very patient.",1251936000,,2030,4.670422535211268
3733080,3,B001OQCVI8,"PUSH seems a bit convoluted as another time warp flick where what you see is supposed to happen in the future but the ""future is always changing""...my head hurts just thinking about all that.  It's kind of like HEROES meets well, itself actually because Heroes already has a storyline where some of the special people work for the dark side. I think that if not for Dakota Fanning, I wouldn't have liked this movie much. The lead guy is cute; actually, all these people are nice to look at. But that screaching scream...OMG, I wanted to kill those idiots myself. That was THE most obnoxious thing in the entire movie. The ""bleeders"" they call them because their screams are so piercing that they make your internal organs and brain bleed out.  Not very nice.

The movie was filmed in Hong Kong so it's loaded with exotic scenes and lots of color for visual interest. But sometimes it seemed like I was watching a music video, not a movie. That's so played.

This movie probably makes more sense when you watch it the second time around, but I wasn't willing to endure that awful screaming or the boring parts, so I'll never get more from it than I did the first time I watched it. I just didn't care enough about the characters to watch it again.

I've spent 2 hours in worse ways. I give it 3 stars. I'm glad I didn't pay the money to see it at the theatre, although they sure make the previews look great (but don't they always?).",1251590400,,1432,4.429657794676806

(I'm waiting for the prequel, even -- Nick and Kira running bush league cons at Coney Island!)  Dakota Fanning steals every scene she's in, and with the possible exception of Maggie Siff, may be the only full-time working actor on the DVD.  It's amazing to see a film with this subject matter that isn't bogged down in left-over Twilight Zone cant about the self-punishing nature of psi.  These kids (including the old woman on top the building and the ink-stained scholar on the yellow boat) revel in their abilities, and wish they were much, much better at them.  They need to be.  Division, which shares the same dream but a far different end, is better than they are.  Far from not suffering these witches to live, we can celebrate their lives entirely steeped in the ambience and philosophies of the Orient.  Hong Kong has never looked grittier or prettier, even counting that stupendous walking soliloquy in the rain from Ghost in the Shell.  I don't think I've watched an SF movie more, with the exception of Them! and Blade Runner, including Star Wars, Star Trek, Close Encounters, and Alien(s).  Push delivers.  I mean, who can think of Bleeders, for crying out loud?  Watchers, with all their foibles, feel absolutely right because their errors are based on the right quantum stuff.  Pushers are, I'll admit, a bit of Old Hat -- e.g., Isaac Asimov's Napoleanic tyrant, The Mule, from Second Foundation, could realign an assassin's loyalties with a glance and so takes honors as the archetypal Pusher.  Sniffers are... predictable, true, but... THIS banal?  Push has humor.  I like lots.",1251158400,4,1711,4.868512110726644
3733082,4,B001OQCVI8,"I first heard about ""Push"" at Comic Con in 2008.  I got to see some sneak peeks and got to hear from the cast about the movie.  I wasn't hooked by the whole superpower aspect, oddly enough, but by the fact that it was partially grounded in reality.  I think that's what I thought was so good about it.  The initial concept for ""Push"" was something that actually occured during WWII.

The cast of ""Push"" was perfectly picked.  For fans of little Dakota Fanning, you'll find that our favorite starlet is growing up quite quickly and has not lost her talent at all! Chris Evans is quite different in this movie compared to his The Human Torch in ""Fantastic Four.""  He's shown himself to be more of a serious actor.

I think that this movie received a lot of mixed reviews because it's too compared to things like Marvel and DC Comics, which just isn't fair because this film just doesn't have the legacy that those films and comics have.  ""Push"" is it's own universe and has a very interesting history.

The setting is Hong Kong and the first scene shows a young boy escaping as ""The Division"" a strange and dark government agency is continuing the work of the Nazi's.  They are genetically engineering people into psychic fighters.  If someone does not want to be part of the Division, they are killed.

The story focuses on Nick Gant (Chris Evans) and Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning.  Nick saw his father killed by The Division and has been hiding for 10 years in the only place he finds safe - Hong Kong.  Nick is in his early 20's and Cassie, is only 13.  Cassie is a ""watcher"" and able to see the future (clairvoyant); Nick is a ""mover"" and able to levitate objects, but wants to hide his powers.

Cassie pops on the scene to ask Nick to help find Kira (Camilla Belle).  Kira has escaped and she is a ""pusher"" (they possess the psychic power of mind control).  Soon the ""sniffs"" - The Division's Bloodhounds see the new threat to their goal of taking over the world's civilization.  Nick and Cassie start to run for their life.

There are moments that help explain the story that flash by. I actually liked it a lot. It was better the second viewing as it became clear how the subtle little things all fit together.

Talk about a psychological thriller.  This one is so far out, I thought it was the sequel to ""Easy Rider""...2009 edition.  Child star Dakota Fanning is superb, as is co-star Chris Evans (tremendous resemblance to 50s rock n' roll heart-throb Ricky Nelson).  If you like non-stop action and twists that will have you scratching your head (whether or not you have hair), then don't wait to be ""pushed"" before you see ""PUSH"".

3733122,3,B001OQCVI8,"Failed mental Nazi experiments lead to a new quasi-global society of scientists attempting to create people with special powers.  There are Pushers who control minds, Movers with telekinesis, Stitchers can heal and hurt with touch, watchers who see the future, Shadows who can hide objects and people, Sniffers who are equivalent to human bloodhounds to the Nth degree, and Bleeders who can scream so loudly that they cause brain embolisms, or something.  The government wants control of these people, and wants to enhance their abilities, for nefarious purposes of course.  This doesn't sit well with the human lab rats who die when injected with experimental goo that looks like soy sauce.  When one woman cheats death and improbably escapes a lab, there is a race between the government (headed by Djimon Hounsou), an Asian gang, and some friends (Chris Evans & Dakota Fanning) to find her and exploit her genetics.

The action and special effects are above par and my favorite aspect of this film.  Several of the ""push"" scenes - none involve prison relations - are quite clever and exciting, like controlled shock waves exploding from a ShoRyuKen in a well done Street Fighter movie (looking at you JCVD).  The boundaries of this movie were only limited by imagination, and the potential remains untapped.  The rest of the cinematography is typical Hollywood: good but not great.

As for the acting, I think Djimon Hounsou absolutely stole the movie.  He's calm and calculated at times, almost caring, completely evil in others.  Screaming, rampaging villains are never as intimidating as those confident masterminds, and Hounsou exudes this persona.  Chris Evans merely changed his superpower from flames and flying to telekinetic tricks.  He's competent enough for a lead, and I can see him as a potential big budget star in the near future.  Dakota Fanning, on the other hand, was horrible.  She seems lost, unconvincing emotionally, and completely forced. One scene in which she's wearing an inappropriately short skirt, and is supposedly drunk, is so bad that even Pedo Bear disapproves.  It's as if the role was meant for someone else, but the casting agent was talked into selecting Fanning on name and age alone.

An average plot partially stolen from combining X-Men and Firestarter does not a good movie make.  The superhero flavor and coup de grace setup turn into nothing more than a paranormal plot plop.  This film would have improved greatly if there were ""special"" powers for people called Moaners, Gaggers, and Massagers. Now THAT'S a movie!  Let's just hope that the setup for a sequel gets axed by this film's poor reception.",1250035200,,2649,5.059907834101383
3733143,3,B001OQCVI8,"This movie is best described as a mix between Lost in Translation and The Heros. This is a low budget action film which is set and shot entirely in Hong Kong.

The film seemed to be shot in very short number of days. Many scenes look downright unrefined, almost as if the actors memorized the lines right before the scene without any rehearsal.

The cinematography, setting, music, and the overall visualization are similar to the Lost in Translation. For example, the entire movie is set and shot in Hong Kong (LIT was shot in Tokyo).  Hong Kong, which is one of the truly great metropolis of the world, was shot beautifully. You will also hear the background music similar to Lost in Translation.

Its action sequences and much of the story line are similar to the TV show The Heros.

The best part of this movie was Dakota Fanning. But it was very apparent she was playing a role way too old for her. She plays a super savy 14 year old girl (her character should have been at least 16) with a power to see the future. She is alone in the city of Hong Kong (she can't even speak the native Cantonese) and she takes care of herself without adult supervision while cleverly escaping her enemies. I thought that was a real stretch. The writers tried to make her seem older by giving her adult lines and making her drink alcohol, but I wasn't convinced.

The ending was unsatisfactory (how about all the loved ones still imprisoned in the Division?). Perhaps the producers wanted leave some room for a sequel. But after watching the original, I am can't say I am interested in watching the sequel.",1249948800,,1595,4.520833333333333

3733146,3,B001OQCVI8,"I primarily watched this film due to the fact that Djimon Hounsou was in it.  In my opinion one of the most under-rated and least noticed actors of his time.  As I saw his performance in Gladiator, Four Feathers and The Island (among others), I was very interested in how his performance would be in this.

Sorry to say, I believe that the film was beneath him.  Where I feel he did a great job in filling his role in the capacity that it was cast, sadly enough, the role had already been done.  The film really didn't leave too much to be guessed upon.  At the end, they attempted to take a twist with the plot...honestly though it didn't hit me as a surprise.  Only a possible outcome that I had already determined as a possibility.

Die hard Fantastic 4 fans will burn me for this, but sorry, Chris Evans?!  Whereas he tries...he's never been what I would call an impressive actor.  This film, in my opinion was below Dakota Fanning as well.  After the impressive roles that I saw her play in ""Man on Fire"" and ""Trapped"" (even though they were very similar roles), I felt as though she was far more capable than this.  However, I guess she needed a break away role such as the one offered in ""Push"" to provide viewers with a different perspective on her.

Now for the FX and all that jazz...

As usual, I've always come away from most (like I just said, most) films with the impression that the funding for the FX was a little under par.  Whereas this wasn't completely a let down, I think that so much more could have been done.  The recent Dark Knight film took advantage of the potential that was to be offered...this film did not.  However, when I go to see a flick such as this I expect it to be just chock full of chaotic nonsense that is beyond anything imaginable.  Where this film showed great potential in that arena, I feel as though they could have done so much more.

Granted all of the above has been somewhat vague and cryptic as I do not wish to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it.  I would simply suggest that you consider renting the film before taking the $15 to $30 plunge and having it permanent style.

Final thoughts:

- Interesting enough to watch all the way through
- Shallow enough to have on the tube without having to dedicate an afternoon to its interpretation
- Nothing special, just pure entertainment

In that regard, I'll give it 3.5 stars.",1249516800,,2388,4.377272727272727
3733147,3,B001OQCVI8,"On the surface, ""Push"" has a lot of similarities to ""Jumper."" Both have heroes that don't want to be, have major parent issues, they're not great at their power till the end of the movie, and both are being chased by an African-American government official. However, instead of the whiny Hayden Christensen, we get a cool Chris Evans. Push builds up an interesting mythology surrounding its characters, but to do this, and establish the characters, the movie is a lot of shots of walking and talking, with not much action. When there is action, it's usually the heroes getting the crap kicked out of them, since they're not very good at their powers. And with this generally slow pace, the movie is very forgettable. You're still going to finish the movie, but you're not going to be anticipating it very much. Don't get me wrong, there's some cool moments, but they're few and far between.

I also found Dakota Fanning's character both charming, and darkishly funny. It's not everyday where you find a 14-year old drunk in a movie. The movie does add it's interesting elements, but it's also mixed with lots of cliches and general confusion. As for the ending, while not giving anything away, it suspensefully leads up to it, and they wrap it up nice, but it's also cliffhanging with the overall story arch. Thus as the credits role, it's begging for a sequel. Guess what, it's not getting a sequel.

Overall, if you're looking for an charming, slow sci-fi film with superheroes, that requires a sequel it'll never have, this might be the movie for you. Otherwise, it's a rental at best. And yes, I love Chris Evans all the more with this movie, and I wouldn't put this past as being a future cult hit.",1249257600,,1703,4.673333333333333
3733148,5,B001OQCVI8,"The DVD comes with an audio commentary with director Paul McGuigan and two stars, Chris Evans and Dakota Fanning. I watched the commentary track after viewing the film. The commentary certainly helped to pull it all together. Also, McGuigan, Evans, and Fanning made it clear that they had a lot of fun making this film. I found the commentary to be entertaining in its own right.

I feel that this film succeeds on so many levels. All of the actors are completely convincing. The cinematography is great, one of the best hand-held-only productions that I have seen. The direction is solid.

The story is about a group of paranormals who can do things like move objects with their minds, foresee the future, control others' thoughts, and conjure memories by touching objects and smelling scents. Fascinating concepts.

It centers on a search for a syringe filled with a chemical that can greatly expand these paranormal powers and give the possessor supreme strength. The syringe is priceless and is coveted by forces good and evil.

Particularly effective is the stunning Camilla Belle as a ""Pusher"" who can control thoughts and plant memories.

It's set in frenetic Hong Kong. The film is very ""busy"" too. Indeed, the plot is almost too complex, with diverse strands that test the viewer's ability to focus.  But it all comes together brilliantly. I plan to watch it again. It's a keeper.",1249084800,2,1389,4.914529914529915

The acting was very good, particularly Dakota Fanning, the story was interesting, the effects were exciting, and the characters were likeable (most of them, anyway).  My only caveat is the very end of the movie, which just fizzles.  The last fight scene is very cool, but after that the characters seem a bit lost as to what to do.  I don't know, maybe they were trying to leave it a little open ended so there would be room for a sequel. I would definately watch a sequel.",1249084800,,601,4.339285714285714
3733150,2,B001OQCVI8,"Imagine a world where seemingly ordinary, everyday people living among us were granted the gift of super powers. If you're thinking that I'm referring to NBC's hit show ""Heroes"" you wouldn't be too far off the mark, as this is essentially the primary concept on which that series is based. Even though the premise sounds an awful lot like that show, what I'm actually referring to is the recently released sci-fi drama, ""Push"" starring Chris Evans, Dakota Fanning, and Djimon Hounsou.

""Push"" focuses on just a few of the many super-powered beings that populate our world, as they battle an evil government organization known as ""Division"". When a young telepath named Kira (Camilla Belle), whose ability classifies her as a Pusher, escapes from a Division compound with a very valuable secret in her possession, Division must unleash its most powerful assets, led by an even more powerful Pusher known as Carver (Djimon Hounsou), to bring her back. To save herself Kira must rely on Cassie (Dakota Fanning), a 14-year old Watcher (one who sees the future or a possible future), and Nick (Chris Evans), a telekinetic Pusher.

When watching ""Push"" one quickly begins to realize that if they are a fan of the TV show ""Heroes"", they need to do their best not to think too much about the similarities between the two entities. I understand that finding an original idea in television and film is becoming much harder to accomplish; however, when an idea for a film appears to be an almost blatant carbon copy it gets to be a little bit frustrating. That being said, while ""Push"" closely resembles ""Heroes"" in many respects, I did do my level best to attempt to ignore those similarities and just judge the movie on its own merits. I will admit I do have to deduct some points for the obviousness of how unoriginal this idea for a film truly was.

Screenwriter David Bourla (""Larceny"") does start things off by earning the film some credit by approaching these super-powered beings in a way I hadn't expected. Bourla chose to actually have the characters be accustomed to their powers, and in some cases thoroughly enjoy having them at their disposal. I had anticipated that there would be some characters that despised their lot in life and would view their powers as a curse more than anything else; while that does occur in one or two instances, for the most part every one of these individuals appear perfectly content with their abilities. This is one aspect of the story that was more of an original thought for a movie such as this. In truth, it is the approach that I wish ""Heroes"" would have chosen to go with for the majority of their characters, rather than having so many of them loathing their circumstances. Anyways, I digress.

Aside from that initial approach to super-powered beings, the remainder of the screenplay trudges along at a menial pace, plagued by several bouts of clich-ridden or simply bland dialogue, until it is time for another requisite action sequence to show off one or more of the characters super powers. While the dramatic areas of the film leave something to be desired, at least the action scenes were entertaining, allowing the audience moments of excitement to break up the monotonous proceedings.

One other major gripe regarding the story of this film is that the second half falls prey to several major plot holes and logic errors that cause the movie to completely crumble under its own weight. Not to mention the final moments of the movie leave several plot threads dangling, obviously in hopes of a sequel; however, the film isn't strong enough to support another installment. Truth be told, the writer, and for that matter the director, producer, or anyone else involved in the production of this film, should have realized that the prospect of a follow-up was an ill-conceived notion. Therefore, the story should have been much more resolved at the film's closing with only minor plot points left open for the possible (unlikely) sequel.

Director Paul McGuigan (""Lucky Number Slevin"") imbues the film with a gritty, realistic tone, and his choice of lessening the flashiness of the visual effects employed for the various powers was a wise decision that strengthened the overall feel of the movie. I also enjoyed the vast amount of detail on display in a majority of shots in the movie, but I did find it distracting that the director chose to apparently switch cameras at random. This choice resulted in some scenes, or moments within a scene, to be covered in a very thick layer of visible grain that is absent the rest of the time. The random moments of heavy grain over the image and occasional flashes of bright white or washed out scenes made me wonder if Paul McGuigan was trying to make this movie more artistic than it could ever hope to be. Whatever the intention for those odd choices, the result was a mixed bag of visuals that left me bewildered in the end.

Starring in this wannabe superhero flick is Chris Evans, who is no stranger to special effects intensive movies after his work on the two ""Fantastic Four"" films. As an actor Chris was able to show off a little more of his acting prowess in this film than he was in the aforementioned. However, having seen several movies where Chris' characters are more sarcastic in nature, I found myself wishing for a little more levity from his character than what was on display. Alongside Chris is the talented Dakota Fanning (""Man on Fire""). Dakota has impressed me with her acting talent for quite some time, and for someone so young she knows how to draw the audience in, but in this film her role just wasn't enjoyable. At times I actually found Dakota's character somewhat irritating, and wished that she would have received far less screen time.

Joining Chris and Dakota as a super-powered fugitive is actress Camilla Belle (""10,000 B.C."") who plays her role in a manner that is so bereft of emotion that one could almost conclude that she had absolutely no desire to be in the film. I find it extremely annoying when an actor or an actress agrees to a role and then proceeds to play the part without any shred of conviction. Why sign onto a movie if you don't actually care to put forth an appropriate amount of effort? Rounding out the primary cast of characters is the underrated Djimon Hounsou (""Blood Diamond""). Unfortunately, Djimon's role in this film as the lead antagonist won't be garnering him any more attention for his work, but his role in the movie is a highlight as he brings such a powerfully commanding presence to any character he portrays.

""Push"" is a movie conceived as a painfully obvious attempt to cash in on a trend, such as the continued success of comic book movies or the popularity of ""Heroes""; however, due to its lack of originality and coherence in the last half of the film, it falls well short of its much more capable contemporaries.

""Push"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1249084800,,6935,4.766860949208993

Anyway, even if you don't care for movies unless you can turn your brain off while watching them, you should still like this one for the characters alone. Evans and Fanning have really great chemistry and their relationship is completely believable. The cast of supporting characters are all quite good as well, except for Belle who turns in a rather lackluster performance.

From the ads, I expected a lot more....even the special effects did not live up to what I expected. I am a science fiction lover, having people with powers fighting some bad guys usually is a recipe for success....ok, I even found some things to like about Watchmen although that was disappointing too. Anyway, there is an agency, known as the Division, that wants to control the people who have special abilities and harness there powers for their use. There are ""movers"" (who can move objects with their minds); ""watchers"" (clairvoyants); ""pushers"" (who influence people) and ""sniffers"" (who can track people by touching objects that those they track have touched). Nick Gant, a mover, has been on the run from the Division since his father, after saying something cryptic about helping a girl, was killed several years prior. Now, Cassie (a young watcher) is contacting him about helping a pusher, Kira, who has escaped from the Division and the clutches of the bad guy ""Agent Henry Carver"". Don't get me wrong, there were a few great special effects, but not enough to overcome the weird half finished plots. I don't know when it spun out of control, but I remember feeling cheated and oddly unsettled. I really ended up thinking, why did I rent this. Honestly, it wasn't even good enough for a Sunday evening rental, and definitely isn't worth purchasing or seeing at the dollar theater.

3733163,4,B001OQCVI8,"I like action adventure movies with lots of over-the-top commotion and a bad guy whose demise I can cheer. It is very rare to have a good action adventure movie and a good plot at the same time - either the plot gets in the way or it is quickly discarded. It is even more rare to have solid character development within the action adventure genre.

Where does Push fit in? Push is an average action adventure movie with limited plot and character development. There is no way to compare this movie to Star Wars or Lord of the Rings but it stays true to the format without deteriorating into a pure adrenaline junkie flick.

Things I liked:
* Somewhat consistent plot with the suggestion that it is part of a larger story arc.
* Believable chemistry between the actors.

Things I did not like:
* Nick suddenly becoming a super master-tactician. His opening scenes showed he was not exactly the smartest cookie in the box. Something else was needed here.
* The voice over in the beginning was boring and not really needed - let the actors tell the story.

Things that really surprised me:
* Dakota Fanning - She carried the movie - without her the movie bombs.
* Hong Kong - The backdrop for this movie was a nice touch.

Things I want more of:
* Dakota Fanning - I am not a Dakota Fanning fan. She's cute but not my type of actress. However, she was definitely the motor that made this movie hum.

3733165,4,B001OQCVI8,"Deserving three-and-one-half stars instead of four (I always round up), director Paul McGuigan pushes, pulls, and drags Chris Evans, Dakota Fanning, and Djimon Hounsou through ""Push.""  It's a science fiction mystery in the same vein as a number of comic book-based films.

While the film itself is not based on a comic book series, DC Comics' Wildstorm released a six-part prequel that served to set the stage for the film.  Knowledge of this prequel is not necessary to understand the basic plot of the film, but it does flesh out some of the ""types"" of psychics in ""Push.""  The psychics in this film range from Movers to Bleeders and Pushers to Watchers.  For the sake of brevity, I will not address all of the ""types"" in this review.

In the film, Mover Nick Gant (Evans) reluctantly joins forces with young Cassie (Fanning), a Watcher who has visions of her and Nick's own demise.  Despite her visions, Cassie hopes that with the help of Nick she can bring down the Division, a government group who regulates (usually with a fatal outcome) the lives of the psychics.  The Division sees psychics as potential superweapons and runs secret tests on them.  One psychic in particular, Cassie's mother, is so powerful that the Division has hidden her away from society.  Cassie hopes to save her as well.

In order to stop the Division, Cassie and Nick must locate Kira (Camilla Belle), a powerful Pusher who has escaped from the Division with a case that contains something that can put an end to the Division's power.  On her trail (and also out to stop Nick and Cassie), is Agent Carver (Honsou), a strong Pusher who works for the Division.  Throw into the fray a third group known as the Pop Family who are after Nick and what's in the case as well, and you have plenty of psychic battles ahead.

The action in this film is very fun to watch.  The special effects are nearly flawless.  With that said, however, ""Push"" never really takes off.  The film suffers from a plodding and twisted plot that makes for long, dull sequences between the action.

The battles and effects make this a three star film.  McGuigan's direction and the acting of Honsou and a solid supporting cast give it a half-star boost.  Honsou is cold and calculating as Carver, and he makes the character much more interesting than it should be.  Ming Na, Cliff Curtis, Nate Mooney, and Neil Jackson (who all play psychics of different abilities) rise above Evans and Fanning.  Curtis, despite having a small role, eats up the scenery and captures the viewer with his witty style.  Ming Na, who gets just a tad bit more screen time than Curtis, is both believable and beautiful in her role.

The DVD comes with just a few deleted scenes, commentary that I didn't bother with and ""The Science Behind The Fiction,"" a brief, ten minute documentary on the potential for real psychics to be walking among us.  It's actually very interesting to watch and I enjoyed it just as much or more than the film itself.

""Push"" should have been an excellent film.  It had an interesting premise, good actors and a solid director.  Unfortunately, David Bourla's weak screenplay doesn't give the cast and crew enough to work with.  Due to the solid direction and above average acting, though, I'd have to say that ""Push"" is worth a look.

This movie isn't something for the average ""there's something shiny on the scene"" movie watcher.

Clues are laid out through out the film of what's happening from the moment the movie starts, which was a scene from 20 years prior (then revisited later to clarify for those that didn't catch on).  The plot is complicated, twisty at times, but intriguing enough to keep me entertained and focused.  Play attention when you watch, everything that's happening means something by the end of the movie.  You literally miss something if you blank out for five minutes.

The chemistry between Chris Evans and Dakota Fanning popped from the get go and I thought that their interplay was so good that Camilla Belle was the one that felt like the third wheel when she entered the scene.  All the ""secondary"" characters were sharp, fast and had a meaningful role to play throughout and none of it felt forced, even the screaming Asian mob guys.  Hong Kong was a good backdrop for the film with it's twisting winding streets, crowds of people that don't give a damn and where a young 13 year old can wonder around on the streets unnoticed because it is a common practice there.

While not the best movie ever made and there were parts that could have been improved upon, I thought it was a good entertaining film to watch. (It didn't deserve some of the reviews it got here.)

In Hong Kong, a of a handful of young people who can use their mind to perform superhuman tasks, dodge the wanting eye of a US Government Agency called `The Division'.  They want to take them into custody so they can make them operatives for their own use.
The two main antagonists, Nick Grant and Cassie Harper, played by Chris Evans (Fantastic Four, Cellular) and Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds) are second generation young people whose parents were hunted down and either killed or captured by The Division, led by Carver (Djimon Hounsou).

The movies location does add to the originality, at least the look.  The characters are pretty human.  The actors give solid performances given the script is a bit sparse at times.  The leads have some good dialogue but the beautiful Camilla Belle is left to be mostly eye candy.  Dakota Fanning is stepping out of her safe zone and playing a pre-teen `Watcher'.  She has a couple of bright moments where this tough exterior girl shows just how scared she really is.  The plot reads like a fugitive chase movie, the difference being that everyone has abilities.  Which is another issue I had with the movie...who in this film DIDN'T have powers?  Hard to believe that so many unique individuals could be gathered in one place.

The idea of a superhero movie that doesn't really involve code named super heroes running around in tights is always intriguing, so between that, the style of the cinematography and the powers sets, the movie has many things going for it already.

That's ok as it doesn't ruin the experience for those that do find the film to be a bit entertaining, which is where I come in at.

Certainly this isn't what most people would find to be a classic, in fact, more people would likely find it completely forgettable, or at least want it to be forgettable, than would even give the film a bit of a positive reception.  Perhaps that's just a sign that Sci-fi fans want and demand better and are easily disappointed when it isn't delivered.

What isn't detailed there are all of the details, though the film does only a mediocre job at best in filling in those details itself.  That's perhaps a big part of the reason so many people are down on this film.  Things happen, but there's little explanation why in many cases, which leaves a viewer wondering just who they should be feeling sorry for or who they should be supportive of.  On the other hand, audiences needn't always be spoon fed all of the details and at times it's best to just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride, assuming there's a decent ride to enjoy.

Push is an ok effort that would probably be a 2.5 star effort if it were possible to choose something between 2 and 3.  Maybe even a hair below that (think C minus minus territory), though if there's not much else on, it'll work as an evening's entertainment.  Enough to spend purchase money on?  Probably not so much.

3733245,3,B001OQCVI8,"The family and I watched this video yesterday. From the preview and the trailer it looked to be a pretty good action flick.

We were very disappointed with this movie. I don't want to spoil anything with this movie so I will summarize quickly, a in debt man who cant master his power (the main guy), a gifted girl who can see future and draws, 2 screaming idiots their scream kills things, an older woman who can see all and intimidates the gifted girl. last and not least of course some big boss guy who intimidates everyone in the movie.

There you go I know my review may not be very wordy, but you can watch the video and see how you like it yourself, the best part is the fight scenes thats about it tho.

I watch alot of videos because I enjoy them this video I thought we would like. However if you want to watch an awesome movie, watch Knowing.",1247270400,,852,4.214723926380368

Negative: Well many,
 (1.) Too heavy of a reliance on an Asian city backdrop and overbearing distracting music to provide ambience.
(2.) Excessive wire use (people and things flying around) to the point of ridiculousness to provide action.
(3.) Choppy editing of head shot jumping to head shot as actors couldn't get beyond exchanging single memorized bland lines.
(4.) Dakota needs to take artistic control of her movies - she's too good for this. She also needs to develop real life experiences outside of Hollywood to expand and be a convincing young adult.

3733250,5,B001OQCVI8,"Last night my husband and I watched the movie Push. I've been wanting to see it ever since I saw the preview. I was a little scared though because usually when a preview makes a movie look awesome, I'm usually disappointed. It seems like most of the time, they take all of the best parts and show them in the preview. Not this movie. I was very, very impressed. I don't normally watch a movie more than once because the thrill is gone. I would watch Push again in a heartbeat.

Division, a government agency, is trying to make an army of unbeatable soldiers. They do experiments and transform normal humans into people with telekinetic powers, people who can see the future and even people who can inside your head and make you think what they want you to think. Three of the Divisions are on the run to escape the agency who is determined to cage them like lab rats. Who will come out on top?

I loved it. There is a lot of action and the special effects are great. And, the most important part, Chris Evans. Need I say more? I could watch him brush his teeth for 2 hours and be happy. If you liked the preview, you should definitely see the movie.

3733284,3,B001OQCVI8,"Lucky Number Slevin director Paul McGuigan helms Push, a sci-fi actioner that it would be too easy to label as an X-Men clone.  Chris Evans (Sunshine, Fantastic Four) stars as Nick, a telekinetic type who reluctantly finds himself allied with a teen girl named Cassie (Dakota Fanning); both of whom are soon on the run from the Chinese mob, and the ultra powerful government operative Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou).  All parties involved are searching for the powerful Kira (Camilla Belle); who may be the key to making those of her type all the more powerful.  Got all that?  Push is definitely hard to follow and make sense of, but the film still manages to have a certain degree of charm to it that sci-fi fans will get a kick out of.  The action scenes are well done enough, and Evans proves that he is leading man material and can carry a film on his shoulders.

3733286,3,B001OQCVI8,"What's your favorite superpower? My personal favorite is the ability to fly, although x-ray vision and incredible strength are also pretty cool. So are mental powers, namely being able to read people's minds and see into the future. ""Push"" is a movie that views mental abilities as a curse instead of a blessing, essentially turning the idea of possessing a superpower upside down. While this doesn't make for a particularly good film, it does allow for the viewer to stay somewhat interested all throughout. I say ""somewhat"" because the story is often times confusing and ultimately unsatisfying; the filmmakers were obviously more interested in developing the neat visuals and convoluted twists more than the characters or the overarching plot. I won't go so far as to say this is a bad film, but it definitely isn't everything it could have been.

The film opens with a voiceover narration provided by teenager Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning). She explains that governments have been keeping watch on people with extra-sensory abilities since 1945. There are several ability categories. Movers can manipulate inanimate objects mentally. Pushers can project (or push) memories, thoughts, or emotions into other people's minds. Watchers can see visions of the future. Wipers can temporarily or permanently erase memories. There are also Bleeders, Sniffers, Shifters, Shadows, and Stitchers, although I won't get into them all. Anyway, a prologue sequence shows a man and his young son, both Movers, trying to escape a hotel from an evil government faction known as Division. They, of course, want to capture people with special abilities and perform experiments on them.

The story proper begins ten years later in Hong Kong, where we meet Nick Gant (Chris Evans), a Mover in hiding, having narrowly escaped being captured by Division as a boy. From out of the blue comes Cassie, who, for reasons I simply couldn't believe, managed to fly to Hong Kong and find Nick completely on her own. She's a Watcher, and she claims that she and Nick will find a special suitcase containing $6 million. Nick has no idea what she's talking about and refuses to help her. Then they go through a frenetic chase sequence, at which point Nick remembers something his long-since-dead father told him about a vision he was given by a Watcher. I won't reveal it, but needless to say, Nick now knows he has no choice--he must help Cassie. Unfortunately, she has some bad news: She has had a vision that both she and Nick will die.

What exactly is this building towards? Let's consider the case of a Pusher named Kira (Camilla Bell); while in Division's clutches, she's the subject of an experiment no one else has survived, one involving an injectable serum supposedly meant to augment her powers. Through a series of very unlikely circumstance, she manages to escape, taking with her a suitcase containing a syringe filled with the serum. Now Division has sent a merciless agent named Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) to retrieve her and the suitcase. He know that Nick and Cassie are somehow involved, which is why he's after them too. So again, what exactly is this building up to? I leave it to you to find out, although I'm hard pressed to say you'll be happy once the film is over.

While ""Push"" achieves much on level of set design and special effects, it simply doesn't have the story power necessary to stay afloat. As far as the story goes, all it really has to fall back on are a series of clever surprises, each more twisted than the last. This can be overbearing at a certain point, especially in conjunction with a story that was complex to begin with. Moments of comedy relief, which are blessedly few, don't help much. There are scenes, for example, featuring a Shadow named ""Pinky"" Stein (Nate Mooney), your typical smart aleck. One of the least appealing scenes in this film is of Cassie getting drunk. Apparently, she believes that liquoring herself up will boost her powers. If this was intended to be a humorous moment, something when horribly wrong; in the context of a science fiction thriller, a drunken teenage girl just isn't funny.

This movie could have been so much better if only it hadn't been so hard to follow; maybe I'm just dull, but I see no reason why this couldn't have been a simple story about simple characters doing amazing things. The idea behind ""Push"" is that it's ""a new evolution of hero,"" and I'm all for that; not every hero has to be a goody two shoes who spends all his time thwarting criminal masterminds in major cities. But this movie tries for more than it can deliver, not only in terms of the whole mental-superpowers gimmick, but also in terms of its story, which is far too ambitious for its own good. While not the worst film to come along this year, it certainly will not be regarded as one of the greatest. You'll probably have a more fulfilling time daydreaming about flying, as I did.",1246579200,2,4925,4.81678486997636
3733287,4,B001OQCVI8,"I wanted to rate this a tad lower but there are no half stars here. But coupled with how good the effects quality and color saturation turned out, I had to go with four on top of the average film result. The story has excellent promise in making a benchmark Blu, but after listening to the commentary and surfing through the very sparse special features, it was apparent they were not interested in preserving anything more than the film.

This is one of those cases where you have to read that 15 paragraph review here about this condensed and saturated plot. I would almost compare this to Jumper insofar as they are both special effects films that should have been much longer to contain all of the points being conveyed. So that leaves the transfer quality for me.

The film has plenty of chances to test your brights and hue contrasts. I counted well over 30 scenes of indoor colorings and set designs (with and without special effects) that provide your display with eye candy galore. After trying this on several different displays though, I noticed if it isn't set for a ""neon"" kind of film like this, the mix can look a little fake. The sound is once again the selling point. Those ""screamers"" or whatever those guys are, can blow out your mids if the volume is set too high prior to their entrance (first fish market scene). But the sound crew put some time into the DTS and outside of all the dialogue, one can get a solid channel usage.

Honestly, the special features irritated me. They should have had hours upon hours about everything this film has to offer, instead we get nine minutes of Col. John Alexander talking about the probabilities of these talents existing or not. For those that follow everything Alexander, you might dig it. Otherwise, all that is left is the commentary with Evans, Fanning and the director. It was more comical than informative, and did actually shed some light on the mistakes I saw in the film, mainly any car scene (the shortcomings of the CGI car scenes were the only real fault I saw on Blu). McGuigan was quick to admit no Hong Kong cab ride could be like it shows in the film (having taken a similar ride I was crying foul right away). I do not think Evans was meant to do a commentary, but Fanning is enjoyable for her fans. The deleted scenes lasted 90 seconds and should not have even been included.

Overall, you get a fun film, punctuated with plenty of slow scenes and cool effects. The supplements are very weak, but the sound and picture give it an above average rating.",1246492800,2,2531,4.531728665207877

3733290,4,B001OQCVI8,"Pay little heed to the negative reviews about this film. PUSH successfully mixes spy with sci-fi and finds an appreciation of the THE X-FILES without directly needing to imitate any particular film or comic book. Admittedly PUSH at times smacks of the film JUMPER (and maybe even a little bit of television's HEROES), but unlike JUMPER, I actually cared about the protagonists in PUSH. Some complain about the lack of ""action"" in PUSH, but I consider the fight scenes to be the flawed, excessive areas of this film. The trailer for PUSH screams ""action film"" in order to get folks into the cinema -- because too often a good film that doesn't strictly fit into a genre must trick the potential customers into thinking it'll be a cookie-cutter event with neither subtleties nor required effort on part of the viewer. On the contrary, along with the fine acting and cleverness displyed in PUSH, it also doesn't hide its *disdain for the obvious*. Dakota Fanning is the clear winner for me here; you'd have to be a pretty heartless [...] not to be rooting for her character in PUSH.
The Amazon editorial review for this film declares this to be an ""often silly work of science fiction,"" which in itself is a silly statement. If you lack imagination and a willingness to suspend belief to some degree, then 8 out of 10 films of many genres will seem ""silly"" (especially one that may be classified as sci-fi). He goes on to say, ""the odd thing is that the story is set in China..."" Duh, come on. Given that the characters were trying to keep Uncle Sam's covert agents off their backs, Why in tarnation would they stay in the States? Finally, he complains that PUSH will ""leave one feeling as if the story is unfinished,"" and that PUSH is ""Complicated to the point of viewer exhaustion."" I'll tell you what is exhausting: film after duplicate formula film after rehashed simplistic film that Hollywood thrusts upon us every year, where all the predictable protagonists/ heroes/ hobbits live happily ever after and we leave the cinema without thinking, ""Hmm, that's intriguing, I wonder what the next chapter would be like?"" I seem to notice that real life tends to leave matters unfinished, so why must a film conform to the opposite?",1245110400,4,2228,4.744845360824742
3733291,3,B001OQCVI8,"I want to start off by saying i would of given this 3 and a half stars if amazon allowed it.

I disagree with a lot of peoples opinion on push. First of all i think credit needs to be given to the writers. This story is not based off a graphic novel, a comic book, or a novel. The movie does start of kind of childish. If gives you almost a corny opening to explain the people with these ""powers"". The movie then goes to China. The movie starts off really slow. It takes a while for it to get going but i thought the middle was good. I don't want to give to much of the movie away but the movie ends strong in my opinion but you have to get through the boring beginning.

The acting is good for the most part none all of the main characters acted poorly.

The director on the other hand didn't do to well. The beginning was boring for the most part because of the lake of suspense in scenes where there should of been a lot of it. You will see chases that are more predicable and boring. There are also scenes that are supposed to be serious but will make you laugh instead.

My last complaint has to do with the run time. The movie was not well compressed and dragged through more noticeably dragging at the beginning.

If your really into sci fi or this type of movie then by all means buy it because when it comes to this type of movie lets be honest there's not much 5 stars out there. For the rest of you that thinks this movie sounds interesting go to redbox and rent it for a $1 i think its at least worth a rental.",1244678400,,1522,4.00990099009901

Yet again, I walked away feeling like most movie reviewers are to wrapped up in how THEY think a movie should be and just can't sit back and enjoy a movie anymore.  The action was great, the story was pretty good, and there wasn't really any bad acting that could spot.  It does make me sad though that after the film barely broke even at the box office, that we won't be seeing a sequel to it since a few of the (more interesting) threads were left untied at the movies end.
