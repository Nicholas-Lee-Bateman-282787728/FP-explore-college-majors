Just before movies and TV got into ""realism"" - characters who loosen their ties, wear jeans, need a haircut, don't enunciate - movies like ""Midnight Cowboy"" changed the entire film industry - made for TV movies like ""Prescription: Murder"" were presented, very slick, somewhat stilted, more driven by dialogue.

Peter Falk's character is a bit boxed in by the staginess, but that can be expected for a ""rookie"" TV character. Gene Barry does his genteel thing, quite mannered, but well in his scope. Katherine Justice, as the wide-eyed, actress girlfriend of the unhappily married Psychiatrist (Barry) is excellent, though perhaps a tad too studied in the Marilyn Monroe style for this late '60s entry, though that can be a boon to proceedings: she's very sensuous indeed in her form-hugging green dress, as she finally gives completely in to the plan, at a last minute review at the Barrys' office; in a way, her captivating beauty creates a incongruous frame for the darkly sinister switched-identity canvas conjured up by the Doctor. While he is planning ahead, she is in the moment - with dreams of a personal and professional leap forward.

Yes, it's Columbo in a tailored suit, with an Oxford education; it's fun to watch over and over again, with the realization that a true, unique television icon would soon emerge.

Opening credits are very effective with ""ink-blot"" graphics and surging Dave Gruisin music.",1204848000,,1452,5.088235294117647
