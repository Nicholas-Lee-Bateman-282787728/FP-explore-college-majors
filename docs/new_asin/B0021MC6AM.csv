8349351,2,B0021MC6AM,"This is a public access, grainy, bad-sound version of two beautiful movies. My film scholar husband does not like the quality of the DVD, but as a layman I found it fine. If you want a high quality version, buy the Criterion version of My Man Godfrey and a separate version of Life with Father. If you want an inexpensive way to buy two wonderful movies but aren't picky about picture and sound, this will work fine. The movies themselves couldn't be better.",1261699200,,458,4.530120481927711
8349352,5,B0021MC6AM,"***My rating is for the film not this DVD itself.***

I literally just finished watching this version of My Man Godfrey.  It is very washed out.  The sound is poor (at best) and, if memory serves it has the same missing scene that the other versions have.  So, really, BUY A BETTER COPY.

This movie merits spending the $25 (or more) for a clean version - there are some available here on Amazon. It ranks as one of those almost forgotten classics - outside of those who remember it when it was new & fans of classic films it is almost forgotten.  That is a shame since it is a great screwball comedy that not only shows the laughter, but touches on the depths of the Great Depression (and the skepticism of the promises of ""prosperity is just around the corner""), the redemption of the man & his generosity.  A truly marvelous film that I highly recommend.  A comedy with a message.",1250380800,,883,4.407407407407407
8349353,1,B0021MC6AM,"(This DVD is region 1 encoding)

My Man Godfrey and Life With Father are two wonderful movies. They are fun, enjoyable, and quite amusing. This version of them, however, is sadly of poor quality. The sound quality is not as good as other versions out there and the video quality is atrocious. The resolution is so bad that you can see the pixels easily. I recommend enjoying these films, but enjoying them is hard when watching them in such poor quality. Although slightly more expensive, other distributions are vastly superior.

8349354,5,B0021MC6AM,"Here's another double feature $1 DVD...this one we found at Walmart...

I've always liked William Powell films...there always highly entertaining and contain nothing objectionable. Even his mermaid film was okay for children. This film is very clean. It's about upper-middle class family life in New York, 1883. Everything is top-notch. With suberb acting and a delightful musical score.

 See what a lady a young Elizabeth Taylor was!

**** 4 Stars! Highly recommended family viewing.

Here's what's on the other side...

Not really a family film, but this is very entertaining, funny, and with a good moral to the story. And it's held up well over all these years. Godfrey is a homeless man living in a city dump. He ends up a butler to a disfunctional upper-class Manhattan family (the mother is a 'hoot'!). The acting is flawless. There is nothing objectional in this film, but i would not recommended it for children. Older teens might get something out of it...as there are some good lessons about character. But overall it's more of an adult family film.

***** 5 Stars! Very entertaining.",1138924800,,1096,4.989010989010989
