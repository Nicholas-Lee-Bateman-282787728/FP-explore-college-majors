8761782,5,B01FXLSWAA,"I am a big consumer of anime, and this one is a delightful ride! It's a great ""brother's"" story with a ton of action, light romance,comedy, and mystery.  I swear it has everything: ninjas, magic, a dragon, good martial arts, and it's a historical piece too, situated around the 1880's.  If you are new to Japanese anime, just wait for the plot to unfold, this one is complicated - but all plot lines will be revealed.  It is a wonderful swirling tapestry of color, music, and character with a totally satisfying ending. This is a series not to be missed.",1518220800,2,554,4.52
