2452505,5,B000C20VKK,"I don't know what film noir means, but I think this is one.  Anyway, this movie is a classic.  It is an art film.  To me, it falls in the category of sort of super-realistic or naturalistic films with protagonists who are not really good people in any accepted meaning of the phrase, like Sam Peckinpah's films.  It may not be as good as The Wild Bunch, but if you liked the Wild Bunch, you will like this movie, provided you can handle the hispanic, post-apocalyptic milieu.  Another film that it is similar to is ""Sucker Punch"".  These are not films for everybody, but on the other hand if you are a fan of this type of tongue-in-cheek, over the top realism, you shouldn't miss this one.  I hope at least Paul Morrissey knows what a good film he made.",1230163200,,753,4.335714285714285

2452507,5,B000C20VKK,"If you jog their memory a little,basically,everybody knows who Paul Morrissey is; he's the fellow who actually directed that legendary underground trilogy Andy Warhol always gets credit for: FLESH, TRASH,and HEAT. What few people know is that Morrissey directed another trilogy of arguably greater scope and power in the 1980's: FORTY DEUCE,MIXED BLOOD and SPIKE OF BENSONHURST. Both MIXED BLOOD and SPIKE are currently to be had for next to nothing on VHS; it's not an opportunity to be missed.  MIXED BLOOD is probably one of the most disturbing films you'll ever see: a middle-aged South American woman has moved to NYC to start a good business,namely taking over the coke trade in Alphabet City,a section of Manhattan ""noted for it's diversity"". Her right-hand,lover and son is a somewhat slow-witted thug named Thiago,who introduces  a wild card in the form of a beautiful siren - a Marilyn Monroe look-alike, whose naive craving for adventures in the unberbelly of the NYC drug world brings near disaster to Thiago & Mom, involved as they are in liquidating the competition. Mom's army,by the way,consists of teenage boys and even a few grade-school kids. The old kids serve as killers and the young'uns run the drugs,everybody camps out in an old abandoned building,the Marilyn can't understand why don't get a better place,they can afford it,can't they? Yeah,but their whole scene rather demands a poorly policed neighborhood and a building with no neighbors. The naive adventuress is going to get everybody killed,before she ends up being killed herself. This a powerful and completely bizarre movie,not to be taken for an action movie,though there is no shortage of that. There are all kinds of bizarre subtexts: Rodney Harvey (MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO) begging for an oppportunity to get started as a killer; a grant-funded neighborhood theatrical group that doubles as a drug drop; the sense of community established by Mom (clean underwear a must!),and most of all the creepy take on multi-ethnicity - the conflict  of cultural values leading to completely different concepts regarding illegal drug distribution and profit-sharing; but most of all the profound claustrophobia of a small,dirty,brutal subculture - virtually a civilization unto itself,half nascent,half decayed - MIXED BLOOD is a challenging film for anyone,and definitely worth the effort. As brutal as it is brilliant and one of the greatest unrecognized classics of American cinema,ever. Everything Gus van Sant knows he learned by watching Paul Morrissey is the 1980's. Let me put it this way: if you like DRUGSTORE COWBOY you'll love MIXED BLOOD. It's one of Duane's all-time favorites. And you know Duane.",1142812800,3,2685,5.23953488372093
8095397,5,B000C20VKK,This Movie is a blast from the past. Was so glad to find it on DVD. This Movie always made me laugh.,1490140800,,100,3.590909090909091
8095398,4,B000C20VKK,Very unique film worth buying.,1449100800,,30,5.2
8095399,5,B000C20VKK,"Mixed Blood is a surprisingly good film, despite the low budget that Director Paul Morrissey had to work with. You also have to understand and appreciate the dark humor that the movie offers, similar to another great Morrissey flick ""Spike of Bensonhurst"" that also featured the late actor Rodney Harvey, (The Outsiders, Initiation) who had some of the best sarcastic / cynical comments along these lines. The feature also showcases the work of one of Brazil's best actresses Marilia Pera who also did a great job in this film in a leading role.",1432080000,,545,4.870967741935484
8095400,4,B000C20VKK,"Surprisingly, these cheesy movies are what  make the recent movies, more appropriated. To me they are. ..",1413763200,,105,5.176470588235294
8095401,5,B000C20VKK,I have been searching for this movie for a long time. It is a low budget movie but it brings back many memories from my younger years. When I searched your list of movies and saw you carried it I had to buy it. I don't regret it the dvd is brand new and it is now part of my collection.,1391472000,,286,3.7049180327868854
8095402,5,B000C20VKK,"Touching, funny, and weird.  LIke nothing else ever.  Especially like the way the mentally deficient but handsome mother-gang leader's son always talks like he's yelling.  Bizarro World version of Romeo and Juliet set in the Lower East Side's Alphabet City before yuppification was even imaginable.",1376697600,,298,5.5777777777777775
8095403,5,B000C20VKK,Mixed Blood  is one of my favorite films.  I have it on VHS but wanted it on DVD also.  We enjoy the performances.,1360368000,,114,3.869565217391304
8095404,1,B000C20VKK,"This movie is probably the worst movie I ever seen in so many levels. It is extremely violent, grotesque, racist, ridiculous and offensive. The characters do not make sense in thought and actions, from beginning to the bitter end. The movie has no plot structure but the purpose of portraying and reinforcing negative stereotypes about Spanish,  and Portuguese speaking people in New York city. Besides the story not being realistic, physical impossibilities are constant in the film as well and as am example there was a young man who got shot through the chest(lung)and he was perfectly functional when this would be a fatal wound in real life. A team of mother and son from Brazil, recruit local Spanish speaking people to go to war with local Spanish speaking people making this unreasonable and unrealistic. A New York city ex cop, who looks like a french painter, and talks with a fake Spanish accent reminds me of Steve Martin in the Pink Panther films. The only thing that I enjoyed in this film was seeing footage of New York city during the early 80's and the disturbing imagery of a filthy, gritty urban landfill echoing human despair and pain of a time and place better of forgotten. It is also worth mentioning that the scene with a young man injecting heroin looked so real I bet they actually had the man inject himself in the film. Whether it was real heroin or not I do not know but dose scars in his arm looked very convincing. All and all this movie is offensive to all people mentioned in the film but particularly to the Spanish Speaking communities and their positive contributions to United States history and New York city society I do not endorse this film what so ever.",1340150400,2,1695,4.668896321070235
8095405,5,B000C20VKK,"Paul Morrissey managed to do what very few filmmakers ever have: to tell the story of fringe groups whose story has never been told WITHOUT oversimplifying or forcing the viewer to accept his own conclusions.  Like Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" and Selby's ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" it neither condemns nor excuses these fringe characters.  It also reminds me a little of the brilliant Brazilian film ""City of God.""  The setting here is alphabet city, the very meanest part of lower Manhattan in 1984.  South American, Asian, Puerto Rican, German, all scheme to cut into each others' drug turf.  The first hour is slightly awkward and amateurish, but the second hour more than makes up for it.",1313366400,,687,4.939130434782609
8095406,5,B000C20VKK,"""Mixed Blood"" is like a time capsule, showcasing a New York that simply does not exist anymore.  Alphabet City has never looked so grimy and dangerous, and so strangely beautiful as it does in this film.  Marilla Pera from the astounding film ""Pixote"" is mesmerizing as the ""den mother"" to a gang of young drug-dealing, murdering thugs, all of them under age, as they can't be sent to jail if they are caught.  Her and her dumb but sexy son Thiago are the ringleaders of a major cocaine/heroin business run out in the open, in front of corrupt cops and countless strung-out junkies.  ""Mixed Blood"" also features a collection of the most beautiful and exotic Latino actors ever seen in one film.  Recommended for fans of the film ""Pixote,"" and other films about gangs and youth crime.  and for those who spent time in NYC in the 80's to early 90's, this one will blow your mind!  There is even a shootout in the Menudo store, ""Menuditis!""  And the little details of slum life that the director picks up on are amazing.  Like the kids who sleep on the floor, with their pant legs tied up with rope to keep out the bedbugs!  The dvd is widescreen and the print looks terrific, especially compared to that washed out print from the old VHS.  Excellent, low budget film, and startlingly realistic, especially compared to over-stylized fluff like the film ""Alphabet City"" with Vincent Spano.  ""Mixed Blood"" is the real thing, a ghetto version of ""Scarface,"" only no one seems to get rich.  On a side note, the film contains a surprisngly high level of violence, most of which looks very realistic, not to mention a very unflattering portrayal of foreigners making their living in New York, ( in other words, this one is quite politically incorrect!)",1274140800,9,1743,4.675409836065573
