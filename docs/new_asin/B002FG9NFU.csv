8368980,5,B002FG9NFU,I gave this series to my granddaughter for a birthday present.  She wanted to learn to knit and crochet.  She loved it.,1403049600,,119,4.363636363636363
8368981,5,B002FG9NFU,"This instructional DVD set is the actual TV series, I thought I was buying season 1 & 2, infill I looked closer at the DVD 's Season 2is a 2box set, & for $12 &change per DVD I was pleased. The only downfall was the bonus patterns that you get, I just assumed that it was a DVD format when in actuality it's a CD-ROM so I had to download it onto my computer instead of  being able to do the pattern right in front on the tv. I can't wait to buy season 3!  Season 1 is 're-playing right now on Create TV &  the host is not Brett( although she is a guest quite frequently)  The host is an actress from One life to Live, I think she plays Caddie, anyway she may be good on her show & the no-no infomercial she does, but not do good as a knit &crochet host . Ok that's my monologue. Peace to all you knitters and cricketers out there!",1377648000,2,830,3.893491124260355
8368982,5,B002FG9NFU,I have only watched a few episodes of the show however I feel like i can get my Knit on again.  I used to watch Knitty Gritty however it's no longer available on Direct Tv.  Then on my local tv we have PBS and it has a knitting show called Knit and Crochet Today. They feature the show at odd times so I can never watch it.  I ended up purchasing their dvd and I feel inspired again. I really enjoyed watching Knit and Crochet Today dvd!  I ended up ordering 2 seasons of Knit and Crochet Today.,1285804800,2,495,4.020408163265306
8368983,5,B002FG9NFU,"I've been watching this series on Create TV and recommend it to anyone who knits and/or crochets.  Each show has great tips, as well as some interesting patterns; and I appreciate the demonstrations of how to do something in particular.  The interviews of well-known people in the industry are interesting to watch and listen to.  If you like sampler afghans, each episode features one sampler square, either knit or crochet; and you can always use these to practice a particular stitch or technique.  I consider this a great reference source to have on hand and have requested that my public library buy at least one set.",1268179200,7,622,4.839622641509434
8368984,5,B002FG9NFU,This is a great purchase.  We don't get this program where I'm from and it's a joy to be able to learn from these discs.  It's packed full of ideas and with a pattern disk to boot.  The interviews are amazing.  I've gotten as much out of the knitting and crocheting in the DVD as I have out of the interviews.  They are worth the price of the DVD.  I've pre-ordered the 200-A and hope they'll put out the 1st and subsequent seasons so I can buy them as well.,1256083200,12,458,4.033333333333333
