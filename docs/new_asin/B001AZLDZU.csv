8280690,5,B001AZLDZU,"This was the funniest movie I have seen in a very long time. I went to the movies with a group of friends and we all agreed, why can't there be more of these kind of movies? We experienced some sadness and a roller coaster of emotions. Many of them included truly funny, funny comedy. The actors and actress' were casted so well. Kathy Bates is hysterical. I really can't believe anyone could see this and not give it a thumbs up. Bring it on..... more good movies like this one! The scenery was certainly a big plus for this movie also. If you want a short trip across our great country and to be entertained while watching it, go see Bonneville, if in fact, they allow it to be shown at the movies. We saw no sex and no murders, hope that does not disqualify this as a winning movie.",1213142400,,785,4.2052980132450335
