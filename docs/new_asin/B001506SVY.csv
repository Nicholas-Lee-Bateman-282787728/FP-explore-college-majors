8256866,5,B001506SVY,"Incredibly well done film, showcasing the first year of outfitting in the Northwest Territory, filmed in the late 60's.  A look into what we now term history, but what was all the latest development back them.  Great commentary.  Honest production.  I outfit in the NWT and nothing really has changed since then.  I was really taken by this film.",1481155200,,346,4.796610169491525
8256867,5,B001506SVY,"I saw this once in the late 1990's and have never forgotten it. It's a once in a lifetime event, captured in the mid-sixties (guessing) of Gordon Eastman and some buddies exploring virgin wilderness in the NWT. It's a time capsule. It would be unfair to call it a hunting video. It's a full-length movie; that does involve some hunting video, but done so respectfully that even non-hunters would still find it entertaining. The adventure of an unspoiled wilderness is captured in a real classic that you will not regret. I am thrilled that I was able to buy it NEW in DVD in 2016. I watched it about 2 hours ago. It's worth the hefty price IMO. There is nothing else out there like it.",1463097600,,685,4.444444444444445

8256869,5,B001506SVY,Super video from Eastman.  It will make you long for the old days when you could still do the things he did in a virtually unexplored wilderness.,1440374400,,145,4.37037037037037

8256872,5,B001506SVY,Another Gordon Eastman great!!!  Most hunters would give anything to be able to explore and hunt the way Gordon and his friends did on this video.,1327881600,2,146,4.615384615384615
