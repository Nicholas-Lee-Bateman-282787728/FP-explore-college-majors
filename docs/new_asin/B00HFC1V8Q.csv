6161656,2,B00HFC1V8Q,"Now that I have my set I can honestly say this set is overpriced big time and so not worth it. This is a great anime series and is one where anime fans should all watch. However, with sets one and two, currently priced at $29.96 each on Amazon, it's hard to justify paying $95 or more for this set. The extras are extremely cheap and doesn't warrant the extra money. Unless you absolutely have to have an artbox and CDs, stick to the regular edition, you'll probably be happier. You can buy sets one and two for roughly $60, combine the sets so they're now sets blu ray and sets DVD and then sell the one you don't need on eBay or something. You'll probably get about $25 - $30 cutting your cost down to $30 - $35. I should have known how cheap this set was going to be when I got my Kamisama Kiss Goddess edition for $40 more than the regular edition. The artbox was very nice but the extras was just so cheap, other than the hairpin. Still came out to be $8 for each of the extra items included. Five items and $40 more equals $8 an item. The artbox is nice and so are the two ost CDs but it's really hard to justify paying so much more for them. Here's another example of how overpriced this item is. I picked up Ranma  blu ray for only $35. With it, I got an 23 eps on 3 blu ray discs and a mini book both housed in a nice artbox. So Psycho-Pass basically cost me $50 more for two CDs as I paid $86 for it. I'm not saying this is a bad series, far from it, I'm just saying before you spend your hard earned money, look around and decide for yourself if this set is really worth getting. Unless you absolutely have to have the artbox and CDs, you're probably better off just buying the regular editions.",1396483200,16,1706,4.0773809523809526
6161657,4,B00HFC1V8Q,"A beautiful box set, but it was slightly damaged upon reception. Nothing major but still any damage is a big deal for myself.",1394496000,2,125,4.478260869565218
6161658,5,B00HFC1V8Q,"I received this early from Rightstuf at a great price.  Is this box set worth buying?

The chipboard is thick and it's a great looking box.  The anime Blu-rays come in one case and the CD's in another.  The extras come in a cardboard box but none of them are very special.  The decal and ID holder are pretty cheap.  The keychain is heavy metal but the logo in the center is just a sticker.  The business card case isn't bad and looks nice but it's still plastic.  Overall it's a nice box set that I'll give a passing grade.

Do buy if you're a collector, if you want the CD soundtracks, if you want the season in one set, if you can buy it for under a hundred bucks.

Don't buy if you want the little trinkets or at a higher price.

This is a amazing must see anime with beautiful animation.",1393372800,22,792,4.111111111111111
6161659,5,B00HFC1V8Q,"This quote from Nietzche, which one of the main characters uses during the course of the show, provides a taste of what to expect from Psycho-Pass: a smart psychological science-fiction, with copious concept debts to the likes of Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, The Fifth Element, and possibly Minority Report. This indebtedness in no way jeopardizes the integrity of the show.  In fact, if anything, it gives Psycho-Pass a sense of tradition on which to build, and a cadre of worthy peers to join.

Psycho-Pass depicts a futuristic society where people are monitored for their latent ability to commit crimes (as in Minority Report).  But while MR depended on clairvoyance to see the future, the world of Psycho-Pass relies on scanning a person's brainwaves to judge the stability of their mental state.  The more unstable a person becomes, the more likely they become to commit a violent crime.  The police then dispatch a specialized task force to neutralize the threat.

These task forces are made up of an inspector (or something of an overseer) and a group of subordinates called ""enforcers.""  Enforcers are brutal and efficient--they are not only willing to pull the trigger, but they also can delve into the mindset of the ""criminal coefficient"" and use that insight to stay ahead of the bad guys.  They can do this because they are (of course) latent criminals themselves, and are little more than glorified hunting dogs (a comparison often made in the show).

The story centers on Akane, a new inspector fresh from our equivalent of graduate school, and her relationship with Kogami, a senior enforcer.  As her fellow inspector tells her, she must draw a line between herself (an untainted citizen) and the enforcers she controls, and not allow her thinking to be altered by her criminally-minded subordinates.  But what if she begins to think the system is flawed, and that the enforcers, for all of their flaws, may actually be correct?

Psycho-Pass demonstrates a willingness to work with familiar source-material (dystopic societies, technological anxiety) and forge a new and sterling show from it.  The show is dark (there is a rape scene within the first five or ten minutes) and bloody (the enforcers weapons, known as ""dominators,"" reduce criminals to bloody splats on the walls).  It also delves into the very human capacity--some might say penchant--for evil.  For a show that claims to be concerned with character psyches, Psycho-Pass also does not disappoint.  We are able to watch the main characters slowly develop and change over time, and are given a sense of a real world where people are bitter over having their fates chosen for them.  To top it all off, the sound track is amazing.  Watch it as soon as you can.

[EDIT:]  Funimation has confirmed a Spring 2014 DVD release of Psycho-Pass, which means purchasing this current product at the listed price is sort of crazy.  Probably better to pick it up from Funimation for $50 or so.",1387670400,26,2965,4.94949494949495

8632400,5,B00HFC1V8Q,Probably my favorite anime series.  The sound track comes in either English dub or the original Japanese voice acting.  You can also turn subtitles on either.,1449014400,,158,5.038461538461538

But the decal, key chain, and card older are great. Is it worth the current price? Probably not.

8632402,5,B00HFC1V8Q,"I caught the series on Netflix and was enthralled by it. Anime has never been something I delved into much, but this series has definitely increased my interest in the genre. I like that they included the OST in this box set, a great addition. The trinkets they include such as the keychain, id holder etc come in their own box as well. The only nitpick is that getting the box with the trinkets out can be a bit tricky as everything is packed neatly, but tight. So there may be a chance you might have to bend the cardboard box in order to get. It's worth the money, I'm not disappointed.",1428105600,,589,4.267857142857143

8632407,5,B00HFC1V8Q,"The series itself deserves five stars, as it is a fantastic criminal investigation series. I, however, will not be discussing the story of Psycho-Pass, but instead, what is so special about this overpriced edition. As is typical of FUNimation's more ""exclusive"" releases, being Limited or Premium, everything is included in a chipboard box.

What junk am I getting?
Well, once you order this, you will be the proud owner of the complete first season (Blu-Ray only)! That's not what you wanted to know? Oh, well you get a two disc soundtrack, buuuuuuut it doesn't have the opening or ending themes. You also get a bad quality ID holder, a decent card holder, a nice keychain, and a nifty sticker. Is it really worth more than a hundred? I would say not. The fact that you're buying a chipboard box, a two-disc soundtrack, and the first season on Blu-Ray, makes it pretty pricey, but the other things are not worth much. Really, it's more like fun extras for collectors of people who really love Psycho-Pass, like I do. Now, I've compared the price on Amazon and RightStuf, and Amazon has the best price I've seen. If you're interested in this edition, I'd recommend picking it up on Amazon, but constantly check the price. I picked it up when the price went down to around $93, but I was so excited, I felt the need to use One-Day shipping. That raised the price quite a bit.

Anyway, the series is great, and I recommend it, but I don't recommend buying this edition unless you really want the random junk that is included. I recommend sticking to the standard release.",1401667200,7,1569,4.6606498194945845
