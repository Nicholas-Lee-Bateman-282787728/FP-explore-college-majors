8754671,5,B01D1VHT58,"One of the greatest film noirs ever, a brilliant film, brilliantly written and directed, with an ace company of players.  If you've never seen it, read nothing about it, just watch it.  The Blu-ray from Twilight Time is fantastic and perfect.  Let no one tell you the UK release has a better ""encode"" - anyone who uses that ridiculous term that no professional authoring house that I've worked with has ever used - it's nonsense.  They are the same transfer and they look the same.",1535846400,,481,4.623529411764705

8754674,5,B01D1VHT58,"""The Big Heat""(1953) is one of those films that has only increased in critical appreciation since it's original release more than sixty years ago. This film noir crime thriller about an honest cop(played by Glenn Ford) trying to solve the suicide of a fellow(and corrupt) police officer is still powerful after all these years. Twilight Time has now released an ""Encore Edition"" on Blu-ray after their original release sold out in 2012. This should be welcome news to those who missed out the first time around. This new ""Encore Edition"" is essentially the same Blu-ray that was released previously with some changes. While the first release was single layered, this new Blu-ray is dual layered and there are more special features that have been added. The cover art has been changed too. But it's still the same story, one that has more suspense and tension than any other film noir of this period. Tightly directed by Fritz Lang, ""The Big Heat"" shows how even an honest cop can fall victim to a crime syndicate that has a strangle hold on a city and it's administration. The B & W cinematography by Charles Lang(no relation) is both powerful and subtle now on Blu-ray(Bitrate: 29.98). There are no vertical lines, dirt, white specs, torn or damaged frames that marred previous DVD releases and viewers will be pleased with the results. The many interiors that occur during the film are very detailed with individual props being easily identified. The acting is top notch with Glenn Ford, Jocelyn Brando(Marlon's sister), Jeanette Nolan and Lee Marvin giving exceptional performances. Gloria Grahame nearly steals the picture however as the tragic girlfriend of vicious gangster Lee Marvin. Her performance as Debby is heart breaking and ranks as one of her best. Columbia reunited her and Ford the following year in Lang's ""Human Desire""(1954) in which she gives another impressive performance.  ""The Big Heat"" is 89 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.33:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. The Audio(English DTS-HD MA) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, crackle, etc.). Special features include an isolated music soundtrack; audio commentary by film historians Lem Dobbs, Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman; video interviews with directors Michael Mann and Martin Scorsese and the Original Theatrical Trailer. There is also an informative booklet enclosed by film historian Julie Kirgo. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a clear and solid Blu-ray case similar to the ones used by Criterion. ""The Big Heat"" is an excellent film noir crime thriller by one of the great directors in film history and comes highly recommended.",1488153600,6,2658,5.138568129330254
