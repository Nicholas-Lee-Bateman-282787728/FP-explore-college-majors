7687884,5,B01CPU8ON2,"Excellent film. Entertaining and suspenseful but hugely informative and definitely mind-boggling. You're literally on the edge of your chair thinking, what the heck is he going to do/find next? So many eye-opening surprises. So MUCH to think about. I saw this in the theater, and it was just overwhelming. I pride myself on being pretty aware/knowledgeable about the subject matter at hand ... but I was still shaking my head in disbelief. People were either dazed or engrossed in serious conversation/banter leaving the theater. Are other countries perfect? Certainly not. Is ANY country perfect? Certainly not. Is there room for debate around Moore's findings? Of COURSE. And is there anything in the film that bugged me? Yes (but just one thing in Norway re: maximum security because - full disclosure - a childhood friend of mine was brutally murdered and possibly tortured -- so I have major bias/concerns around letting a killer with that kind of mindset and that kind of crime out after 20 years). All that said, I dare you -- in fact, I double-triple-quadruple dare you to see this, and then tell me there isn't room for some serious improvements around these-here American parts. You won't be able to. I SWEAR. Watch it, and tell someone else to watch it. Because this really is a must-see for every American citizen. Like they say, knowledge is power -- and boy oh boy do the blinders come off in this one. You will be doing a LOT of re-thinking about life and what it means to be an American. Best ""reality TV"" EVER. Thank you, Michael, for taking the time to do this. Simply ... stellar.",1461801600,6,1599,4.776173285198556

7687887,5,B01CPU8ON2,"Needless to say, this is a must-see! Moore's humor, insight and excellent film-making remains intact. It's also a good choice to show others.

7687888,5,B01CPU8ON2,"You can ignore the corny ""invasion"" rubric.  All of the power of the film is in the interviews.  And they are indeed powerful.  People from a selection of European (and one North African) countries describe the way things are, with obvious spontaneity, and drop their jaws in disbelief when they hear the way it is done in the US.  We see people treating other people as valued human beings, including criminals and drug addicts.  We see an extra comeback (not in the script) where policemen in Portugal ask for the opportunity to speak, to implore the US to give up the death penalty.  We see top educational results in Finland with a policy of virtually no homework.  We see free higher education in Slovenia (Slovakia ?) extended even to foreign students, because education is a public good, and diversity in the student population is good for everyone.  We see the banksters who defrauded Iceland go to jail rather than be bailed out.  On and on....  The punch line is that when asked where they got these ideas the general response is ""From the US.""  Anyone who questions the plausibility of the vision put forward by Bernie Sanders in this primary season owes it to themselves to see this movie.  It absolutely goes without saying that if countries like these can successfully elevate the common good, rising out of the ashes of WWII, there is no way it can't be done in the wealthiest country in the history of the world.  The fact that these goals are so widely seen as unrealistic is a testimony to the failure of imagination.  The ""invasion"" gimmick sucks.  The movie, as a vehicle for the message, however, is an unqualified success.",1460678400,6,1644,4.699300699300699

7687890,5,B01CPU8ON2,A warmhearted delight...so nice to meet people around the world who still feel a connection to their fellow citizens and human beings.  American has drifted far away from these ideas and policies.  Michael Moore has made what I think will be a classic....something to aspire to and something to feel nostalgia about.  I wish this had wider distribution and publicity...it deserves it!!,1460246400,23,385,5.17741935483871
7687891,5,B01CPU8ON2,"I have to admit, I was skeptical.  I did not know what to expect and I thought
this movie would be about the many wars the United States has gotten itself
into, and I was not so interested in that.

But I really did like Moore's last two movies ""SickO"" and ""Capitalism: A Love
Story"", both documentaries that give us Americans glimpses into how other
countries do things and why we do not.

Then I threw caution to the wind and went to see the movie, and this movie
deeply affected me.  From one who grew up mostly in the 60's and experienced
verhy low-cost college in California in the 70's I remembered the feeling I used
to have about the US government and our country.  We had nutritious food for
lunch, and college was doable even for someone making minimum wage.

There is a part where Moore goes to France and the school administrators
explain they look at lunch as a class to teach people how to each ,what to eat,
and how to socialize, and I swear from what I have seen these days in American
schools it just about made me cry.  In my town we have clusters of kids
committing suicide school - they get bullied and life is so hard for them.

Then off to some other countries to look at work, where in Italy people are
ensured they have the chance to actually have a life instead of scrambling
for every penny just to keep falling more behind.

The prison system is looked at, the school system, the justice system,
the drug war ... all of these systems where the US tells us we are the
best in the world, but our metrics and outcomes are next to failing and
getting worse and where we think each other are to blame and resent
the government doing anything for anyone else.

This movie is Michael's best movie.  It cannot help but affect you and
make you wonder why America has turned so sour.  Why do we constantly
think about war, crime, police, terror ... and when will it end, how will it
end?

If I could have one modest wish it would be for every American to see
this movie in the next few months before we might have a chance to
vote for President, and the future of this country and change it for the
better to be more positive.

""Where To Invade Next"" is a very important movie, thought maybe not
so well named.  See it and see for yourself.  10/10.",1459468800,140,2265,4.257009345794392
7687892,5,B01CPU8ON2,"I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this film unless they are braindead. Okay, Michael Moore is not a sociologist. He is a film maker and essentially an entertainer. He entertains, but occasionally he enlightens. Here he enlightens in spades. The conceit of the film is that Moore ""invades"" a number of countries to ""annex"" their best ideas and bring them back to America. So we learn that in Italy every worker gets four weeks of paid vacation and a bonus month's pay for Christmas ( yes, it IS a Christian country). In Slovenia college is free - even for Americans who go there and take courses in English. In French schools lunch is a course and chlidren (ALL the children, apparently) are served meals which in this country you would pay top money for in a gourmet restaurant. In Finland the schools actually educate the children - and do it for a fraction of what is spent in the USA to turn them out into the world as slovenly illiterates.  In Iceland, bankers who lose the money from their own banks are not rewarded with more money  but are sent to jail. (To an American, this part seems like a science fiction movie!) Meanwhile in Norway, prisons treat prisoners as if they were human beings. In Portugal drugs are legal - apparently all drugs - and no one cares or has to. And in Germany... well, it seems that Germany really won the war and they won't tell you that!
The movie has a surprise ending. I am about to give it away - so if you don't want to know, stop here.
The ending is this: all of these ideas (except for the five kinds of cheese in French schools) were made in the USA. So why do Europeans have them and we Americans don't?  This is the missing piece of the puzzle. Moore does not go there. Apparently we are supposed to be enlightened by the movie and then go out and do something. But if America with free elections and rule of law had all these good ideas to begin with, why didn't the ""something"" get done three generations ago? What do all the countries visited by Moore have in common - and what makes them all different from the USA? I don't claim to know. But I notice that every one of them either got rid of their Jews in World War II or had almost none to begin with. Moore actually touches upon this in his German sequence. It seems that in modern Germany they put little bronze plaques into the sidewalk to tell you where a Jew used to live but doesn't anymore. Moore regards this as a good thing. Of course, he doesn't mean it THAT way. But as he tells the tale, it sure ends up sounding that way.",1458432000,29,2539,4.318658280922432
7687893,4,B01CPU8ON2,"Moore takes a trip to Europe (mostly) and examines such topics as schools, school food, free college, company workers on company boards, legal drugs, banking, prisons, and in one African country women's rights. He explains that he is visiting countries to take their good ideas for the United States. Insightful, occasionally slow. Some swearing and bare skin.",1458000000,8,360,5.333333333333333

7687909,3,B01CPU8ON2,"Where to Invade Next, 2015 film

It begins with aerial view of Washington DC. Moore reviews the various wars since WW II. He volunteers to invade countries. There are news events from the past. Moore visits Italy, where they get seven weeks of paid vacation, and 13 months pay per year. A clothing manufacturer tells how they are happy to do this. Employees punch in and out by swiping their cards. [How many hours each day?] Five months of paid maternity leave. Next Moore visits France, rural Normandy, to see a school cafeteria and comment on the meals. He compares the costs is taxes and extra charges. They show a sex education class, and the statistics on teen pregnancy. Finland has the best educated students in the world. How did they do it? They do not have homework, and have fewer school hours.

Are standardized tests harmful to education? Private schools do not exist. They teach students to think for themselves, and to be happy. The next country is Slovenia. College students have no debts, like other countries with free college education. They have courses in English. Should the USA do the same? Moores next country is Germany. They tell about working conditions. Their Corporate Boards have worker representatives. Students are taught history. His next stop is Portugal where there is no law against drugs. Drug usage went down. Moore correlates drug convictions to preventing voting. Convicts are used as low-paid workers. Next he visits Norway to see a prison. He shows a maximum security prison. Prisoners can vote.

They show peoples attitudes. Norway has one of the lowest murder rates in the world. [The effect of a cold climate?] His next country is Tunisia, where womens health services are free. Its constitution has equal rights for women. Then its the island nation of Iceland. There was a lot of improvements for women in the 21st century. A bank operated by women was the only bank that didn't go bankrupt in the 2008 global recession. Iceland prosecuted the bankers for their swindles and put them in prison. Contrast that to the United States which bailed out these banks. Iceland recovered from the recession. The next stop is Berlin at the Wall. It lasted less than thirty years. How many of these ideas originated in America?

May Day celebration originated in Chicago around 1886. May Day is a traditional English holiday that marked the beginning of summer. It was also used to begin a yearly contract. The US Constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment was against punishments like branding, amputation, etc. The death penalty remained in use. This is not as interesting as Moores previous movie. For a better treatment of the Great Swindle that caused the Great Recession watch the documentary Inside Job. Do these stories sound too good to be true? Thats because they are one-sided without an opposing viewpoint. But they do provide questions about politics.",1511222400,,2907,4.938650306748467

7687929,4,B01CPU8ON2,"I agree with most people that Michael Moore is a dirty word. Most of his productions are tripe. He is one sided and targeted and opinionating.

The only film I liked even with the Michael Moore input was Canadian Bacon (1995). His other presentations were hard to watch without making faces.

However, this presentation with all its Mooreisms and targeted narration brings up some good differences and ideas. People like people like me will never like Moore. However, many institutions have lost sight of their purpose. So, ignore that Moore is a snot as and look at what we may be missing.

We also get entertained by great music.

7687950,5,B01CPU8ON2,"The man is a real Patriot who is looking for ways to make this country really Great.
He is not Socialist and probably had no idea whet Socialism is about as almost everybody. I was born and lived in the Soviet Union for 37.5 years before coming here. Can not lecture on the Socialism, too long, but have to STATE and swear that we never had any Food Stamp Program, no Housing, no TANF which stands for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Assistance, no Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit, no Medicaid or anything like that, no SSI  This is a program to pay cash to low-income individuals, no ... no UNEMPLOYMENT, ...
All those programs are not Socialist programs and never were simply because the Second Law of Socialism was: ""Who doesn't WORK does NOT EAT. EVERYBODY was working for a salary. If one was not working, not counting invalids, he/she got sued by the government and sentenced to not less than 1 year in Prison!
EVERYBODY had a roof over the head, no homeless what so ever !!! Yes, some shared apartments, some lived in dormitories, but no one lived under the sky. NO medical insurance of any kind. Your coming to a doc. or to a hospital and get service for free. You pay only for medicine from the drugstore but it cost literally pennies. Have no time to explain how everything worked there. All the Welfare Programs are the ""children"" of Capitalism. U all mixing the meanings of HUMANISM and Socialism thinking that Moore or Sanders or some other Humanists are Socialists. Poor Moore, Sanders and others who trapped by the ignorance about Socialism.

The preview showed what appeared to be fair objective comparison to school foods in France and vacation in Italy. It started out OK, and slowly became more and more liberally biased as it went on. Gaping holes in the stories he covers. Nearly every topic gets obnoxious rhetorical questions from Mr. Moore, often to ranking officials. Never once does he talk about the fact that lawyers and legal system are to blame for much of the high cost for items we have in the US. Nor the private enterprise that control our food system, colleges and healthcare. He demands compensation for descendants of slaves and thinks US should pay for that too.  He supports welfare to the extremes, including college, healthcare and food, but never once talks about how much of the country is not working and doesn't intend to, and yet still demands these free entitlements.",1486339200,3,932,4.717791411042945

Of course, in spite of numerous wars in their background, European societies developed different systems related to the value they place on people, money, education, guns, health, interpersonal violence, etc when compared with America's emphasis on ""individualism,"" I'll get Mine...You get Yours, that has led to an overall avaricious and selfish outlook on life...and NO...I don't think Europe is perfect...but Michael could have added an hour or two to this film - for me - because - overall - it was most informative and, maybe even a bit uplifting to know that life could be different if people tried...Take Care!",1485993600,,1509,5.209876543209877

7688018,5,B01CPU8ON2,This is one of the greatest documentaries I've seen and I watch a lot of documentaries. The way he demonstrates the flaws in American culture and policy are nothing less than genius. I was shocked during this film so much so that I had to pause it frequently just to try to wrap my head around what I was seeing and being told. This is utopian ideology from America that we all know and love but were told was impossible in reality. Now to see that it was being done by other countries while America continued to claim it couldn't be done here boggles the mind. I for one have a new found optimism for the future as a millennial in America thanks in large part to the political revolution started formally by Bernie Sanders and his campaign and due to the illuminating works of other activists and writers too numerous to name whose sole purpose is to improve the quality of life for humanity as a whole. Michael Moore succeeds in communicating his message so powerfully that he literally changed my outlook on life throughout the 120 minute run time of this film.

Very seriously, I used to be a fan of his, but I don't think all of his decisions are properly thought through.

He took a simple concept: war and then compared to other nations that don't do war . . . The result: he looked primarily at Europe and then other nations and then said how great it is to be there. I love Europe too but this movie should have thus been more political in nature as war is decided by politicians.

I was a school teacher and always hated the 20 to 30 minute lunch... we stress healthy eating but the only thing you can eat in this short time is fast food!!
I thought the segment about the schools in Finland, and the Prisons in Norway was interesting. Maybe the most important was the segment on Iceland and effects that women have had on their economy. How they prosecuted the corrupt bankers after the 2008 crash unlike the US. Don't forget Italy, Tunisia, and Germany..... too much to mention. Great Film. My only complaint is at the beginning of the segment on France.... there is a double syllable word used that would prevent me from showing this to my students in school. Too bad Michael.... you could have eliminated this and allowed more students to see this film in school.",1478044800,,931,4.648484848484848

Moore does an exceptional job at showing the American viewer what we are being denied in this nation. This film should be viewed by every person who is running for a political office. It should be viewed by politicians who can affect change at the local, state, and national levels of government. I feel so strongly about this that I plan to purchase a copy of this film for some key politicians in my county and state who I know have probably not viewed this movie. This will be the perfect gift for those Democrats who have forgotten that the Democratic Party should have the best interests of the middle-class and poor of this nation.

7688093,4,B01CPU8ON2,"Michael Moore is an American on a mission to European countries like Italy; France; Germany; Slovenia; Finland; Portugal; Norway; Tunis and Iceland. In those countries, the inhabitants appear content with 7 weeks paid vacation in Italy; gourmet meals at a public school cafeteria in France; free college tuition in Slovenia; the high quality of education in Finland; the police in Portugal; prisons in Norway; and women in Tunisia and Iceland.

There is something to be said that the United Kingdom was omitted this time around by Michael Moore. Perhaps, Brexit results should have given us an idea. I'm surprised that Moore didn't go to New Zealand, Australia, Japan and even Canada.

Yes, it must be nice to have 7 weeks paid vacation; gourmet lunch meals in a school cafeteria; and a high quality of living. In America, our prisoners are poorly treated and fed as well. In Norway, the prisoners even the murderers are treated with respect. The Portuguese police treat suspects with utmost care.

Moore doesn't shy away from difficult topics like the holocaust in Germany or the shooting spree in Norway. The killer only got 21 years old. In the end, Michael Moore  knows there is no place like home and returns to Michigan USA.

It's ironic how a generation ago that young adults wouldn't dream of moving to another country. The USA has plenty of wonderful opportunities too. In America, you have to work hard. Sure I would love a seven week paid vacation but I don't have the money to spend traveling abroad or even in my own country. I work two jobs most of the year.

As for somebody in education, the United States department of education could learn a lot about other countries schools. I also wished there were special features on this DVD like in his others.",1472342400,4,1768,4.7993421052631575

There is also obvious selective truth telling here and there, but it is his film and point of view, and of course, they aren't the outright lies his detractors often take for facts without investigation. The Finnish education system, which I have investigated previous to this film, was the most poignant section of the film as the US seems to be currently at war with it's own teachers.

7688119,5,B01CPU8ON2,"This DVD teaches things in a funny but also very informative way about what is going on in other countries regarding social services, customs, attitudes, standards of living. It concentrates mostly on western European countries and is a real eye opener. You want to pack your things and move tomorrow after you have seen this. The production is mostly a series of interviews with regular local people (and some prison inmates) and only very few officials. That's what makes it so great, no propaganda. Michael narrates and also conducts the interviews so he is in front of the camera fairly often.

I am rating the DVD for the way it was made, the video and audio quality, camera work but also because it has such an upbeat tone about it. The title is somewhat misleading because it is not about invading anyone. It seems to refer more to what we in America seem to be so preoccupied about and how other countries live so very differently, less hectic and more fully.

How is sex education treated in France?  How does Norway treat its prisoners?  The countries from which these comparisons are shown not only includes visits to many countries in Europe, but also even includes the North African country of Tunisia.  These are all easily understood presentations, are not pedantic, and are in the form of interviews with people in these countries.

7688125,5,B01CPU8ON2,"Great Film by Michael Moore!
No politics or criticism involved.
Very informative, educational, funny and interesting throughout.
He travels to various countries (France, Italy, Germany, Iceland, Slovenia, Tunisia, more...) around the world and discovers how they have made life better there by changes to improve lifestyle, governance, education, health, and overall quality of life. Michael Moore is trying to bring these great ideas back to the United States for the benefit of all citizens.
This is absolutely Michael Moore's best film ever and he is very funny throughout.
This is a true feel good film from start to finish with beautiful settings and scenery throughout.
This movie is a must see for all regardless if the viewer likes Michael Moore or not, he is a completely different narrator than you have seen in the movies before...and the film is so sensational, funny, and inspirational you will soon be recommending this to your friends and even casual contacts!

7688136,5,B01CPU8ON2,"For those who prefer democracy over being ruled by the 1% and for those who prefer critical thinking over blind adherence to dogma, this film is a must-see. Basically what Moore does in this documentary is travel to several European nations and one African country (Tunisia). He compares various aspects of American life to its foreign equivalents. The film is gripping and emotional, but leaves you with a flicker of hope that even the USA can change if we stop being apathetic. Here's a generic summary of a few countries Moore ""invades"":

* Germany: very thoughtful, respectful commentary on the people's willingness to keep their country's dark past in conscious light to insure another Holocaust never happens. Moore compares the responsibility white Germans feel toward Jews and other minorities to the ""I've Never Owned a Slave"" mentality of white Americans who keep racism very much alive by pretending slavery doesn't have lasting implications and should therefore be forgotten.

* France: Moore compares the quality of school life for French children to that of American children. It was shocking to see that even in the poorest areas of the country children are served what amounts to a 4-course meal at lunch. The food is fresh, healthy, and costs far less than the sometimes unidentifiable lunches American children are given. Also interesting is the sex education all French tweens receive at school. While jaw-dropping to American sensibilities (they discuss EVERYTHING and they do it in detail lol), real sex education apparently works because American teens get pregnant at a rate that is 6x higher than French teens.

* Italy: Moore compares the overall quality of life and happiness amongst Italians to Americans. Italy, like most European countries, places a great deal of importance on human dignity and enjoying your one and only life. Italians are shocked when they learn Americans aren't guaranteed paid vacations by law and that we consider it a ""great job"" here if we can find an employer willing to give us 2 weeks paid vacation a year. By contrast, Italians have 5 weeks paid vacation (at minimum) annually, 2 hour lunches, are paid an extra month's salary every December, and are given 5 months of paid maternity leave upon the birth of a baby.

* Norway: Moore compares our penal system to Norway's. This particular part of the documentary will probably floor most American viewers. Even someone like me who is left-leaning found myself feeling like Norwegian prisoners are too coddled. Yet Norway's system, built around the goal of rehabilitation instead of punishment, works. (They have one of the lowest recitivisim rates and lowest murder rates in the world.) I was stunned and humbled while listening to one of the fathers of the children killed by that Norweigien white supremacist a few years ago; the man was actually concerned that his child's killer be given a fair trial and a humane incarceration. It was... shocking. And it definitely forces you to question your presumptions about which human instincts are real and which ones are culturally learned responses.

* Slovenia: College students in Slovenia don't understand what ""student loans"" and ""student debt"" are. Education is entirely free, even for foreigners. I was surprised by how many American nationals moved to Slovenia expressly for the purpose of attending college. This wasn't a country I'd ever heard much of anything about, but it's now on my bucket list.

* Finland: Finland is renowned for having the most educated children in the world. Their secret? Short school days, short school years, no homework, and no standardized testing. You also won't see multiple choice Q/A on their tests because the children actually understand the material and thereby know the answers.

* Iceland: When Iceland's version of Wall Street caused the country to fall into a deep recession, the only financial institution still standing was owned and operated by 2 women with a simple policy: if they didn't understand it, they wouldn't suggest their clients should invest in it. This event triggered two massive changes in Iceland, both of which caused the country to bounce back in a very short period of time and enjoy an even higher quality of life than they had pre-recession. The first change, and one I'd like to see employed in the US, was to incarcerate and then exile the greedy bankers responsible for the crash. The second change was recognizing that women are a vital part of a thriving economy. (This realization was also the result of women going on strike for one day; the strike was in all areas of life, both commerce & at home.) Today in Iceland it is the law for all companies' boards to be, at minimum, 40% female. Icelanders believe both genders have necessary strengths to bring to the table and one of women's strengths stems from our tendency to think in terms of ""we"" instead of ""me"". Iceland was, incidentally, the first country in the world to democratically vote in a female president.

* Portugal: Fifteen years ago, after a long and unsuccessful ""war on drugs"", Portugal made the decision to legalize them. The result? Drug use has fallen dramatically and continues to spiral downward. Also worth noting: police officers place human dignity above all else; they are trained to revere life and uphold the dignity of those they must arrest.

Sweden & Tunisia are also ""invaded"". Sweden is highlighted for its exemplary workers' rights (re: Italy) and Tunisia for women's equality (re: Iceland). All in all this is a great documentary with a sad theme: the American Dream is alive & well... just not in the USA.",1469664000,2,5629,4.998932764140875

He loves his country, loves its citizens, and is sickened at what our government has done to the world, and to us.  It is shocking how deliberately the US hides the truth from us, and how complacently we ourselves allow that, and go along with it.  As Moore shows, everything from the genocide of Native Americans, slavery of blacks and current war efforts that have left millions dead or maimed is sweetened with ""patriotism.""  Too many of us  think that patriotism is mindless endorsement of whatever the government is up to.  Wave the flag and either shout support, or stay silent.  Moore has the courage to break silence and show some ugly truth.  He also shows some very hopeful proof that the US has developed the very tools to examine and reverse our destructive behavior at home and abroad, if we only would.  This movie should be shown in American schools.  How I wish we could be as honest about our mistakes and misdeeds as is Germany.  Thank you again, Mr. Moore!",1469318400,,1078,4.680851063829787

I bought this DVD to have house parties to share with my neighbors and family. A light-hearted, not perfect, but deeply moving movie, including honest short views on American history.

7688154,4,B01CPU8ON2,"I won't review the film itself; Moore will never not be polarizing. I think the film is great, classic Moore work. Poignant, cutting, and also funny.

Audio and video are great.

My only gripe would be the lack of any bonus features (no outtakes or commentary, etc.) and, related to that, the relatively high price this seems to go for. Obviously, Amazon prices constantly fluctuate. But a Blu-ray with no bonus features shouldn't really be in the $20+ price range. Perhaps the price will come down over time, and I totally get that this is still somewhat of an ""indie"" film. But Anchor Bay is a pretty big home video distributor among the indies. This film should be around $14.99 on Blu-ray with no bonus features, and should have a list price of perhaps $19.99 instead of $29.99.",1469059200,,782,4.659420289855072

7688182,5,B01CPU8ON2,"Where To Invade Next is a misleading title for Michael Moores latest documentary.  By invade he means to plant the U.S. flag in European countries where people know how to live and bring their ideas home.  Even though what he discovers is wondrous and almost idyllic, the film is very sad for us Americans.  The contrast is stunning.  For example: in Italy everyone gets 30 days paid vacation each year and two-hour lunches and company owners are pleased to have happy rested workers; in France all school kids are served nutritional gourmet food and astonished by how Americans feed their kids; in Slovenia college is freeeven for foreignersand students go on strike if anyone even thinks about charging tuition; in Finland school hours are short and homework nonexistent (and Finlands schools are ranked among the best in the world); in Norway the worst felons are treated with compassion, have no sentence longer than 21 years and low crime rate and low recidivism; in Islamic Tunisia women have free health care; in Portugal using drugs is not a crime, but rehab is offered to those who want it; Iceland has a woman president and all their governing bodies must have at least 40% of each sex (and their country is doing very well); and the Germans do not hide from their shameful past, teaching students and using art and public forums to remind citizens of the Holocaust (compared to U.S denial of African slaves and treatment of Native Americans).
 The irony of the film is that when Moore asks the innovators of these countries where they came up with their ideas, they mostly credit the good old U.S. of A.

Unfortunately, none of his solutions are workable in our Oligarchic Plutocracy or Plutocratic Oligarchy, what ever it is that we have here.  For instance, a national health system... opponents use the old saw ""Do you really want the same people that run the Postal System running health care?""  Have they ever sent a letter via DHL, FedEx, UPS...?  But a better comparison would be ""Do you want health care run by the same people that brought us the heroic first responders who charged into the WTC on 9/11 or the ones provided by the private insurance companies that stood by and watched Chicago burn in 1871?""

Moore has done a good job of showing how things that don't seem to be able to take hold in the USA are just a way of life in other countries. They do it because they believe in the people rather than not doing it because of the cost. Even I would be happy to live in some of those other countries based on the way they do things.

My only negative on this is the way the movie ends. Did Moore take the ideas back to anyone in power who could possibly make change? Who knows - it kind of just trailed off as though he ran out of ideas for the final summary.",1466726400,5,756,3.9025974025974026

That's what they do in Norway. And in Iceland, the kids go to school 3-4 hours a day and (gasp) they almost never have homework, yet are the best-educated kids in the world.

He makes valid points at every turn and does manage to reign himself in at the end of the film. I managed to sit through the entire film, but I got very restless and began looking at the clock in under half-way through it.

7688254,5,B01CPU8ON2,"The only topic Mr. Moore failed to mention---as I recall---is the huge corporate welfare that some very, very rich American and foreign multii-national companies---who consistently have record profits---are getting each year from American tax payers - known as ""CORPORATE WELFARE"".

Example: Big oil subsidies ($37.5 billion/year) - pharmaceutical industry roughly ($270 billion/ year) - Wall Street ($83 billion/year) - General Electric gets over ($836 million each year) -  Goldman Sachs ($121 million/yearly + bailout money $911,764,800,000) - Toyota 1.1 bill and Nisson 1.8 billion/yr. The total is over 1 billion ea. year.

Everyone in America should get and watch Michael More's ""Where to invade next"".

Gee...CORPORATE WELFARE amounts to about 50% more than we spend on aid to US families in need, who are possibly working 2 or 3 jobs.

After Bush Junior gave large tax breaks to US companies to move their plants to China and India, 60,000 US companies moved overseas taking US jobs with them. In 2009, there was a vote in the House and Senate to end the tax breaks and bring back our jobs. One hundred percent (100%) of all Republicans voted to keep the jobs overseas, plus, one Democrat Ben Nelson. Ninety nine (99%) of all Democrats voted to bring our jobs back.

Mr. Moore gives you a good picture of how America has been slowly stepped on to the point of a VANISHING DEMOCRACY. He does not mention political parties. However, it's not hard to see which party is on the 1%'s side and which party is on the side of the middle class and the working poor.

Sincerely,
Political Science obsessed for 11 years",1466208000,,1616,4.919117647058823
7688255,5,B01CPU8ON2,"This is NOT a movie about war and colonization. It's not even directly about politics.

It is, however, a movie that will probably change the way you think, at least on some level. It's a movie that will give you hope for a better America, and it will likely stick with you for a long time. Why? Because you can't help but compare what you see to what we have and how we do things in America, yet it will also show you that it IS possible, if we change our priorities, to have and do these things.

I've seen many Michael Moore's other movies (Roger and Me, Bowling for Columbine, Farenheit 911, Sicko and Capitalism: A Love Story), but I've never seen one as optimistic, hopeful, inspirational and aspirational as this one. Politics are a fact of life, so there are some references to American politics in this movie as far as why the US either abandoned prior practices or has not embraced the ones showcased in this movie. However, it's really eye opening to see not just how other countries do things, but why.

Time after time, you see how other countries deal with employment benefits, education, the war on drugs, the criminal justice system, and even women. For example, in France the students eat real meals (and no soda, just water) at school, because in addition to providing nutrition, the school wants to teach them healthy eating and how they should behave when eating a meal. Yes, it costs money, but to the French, health is more imporant than money.

In fact, that's a common theme throughout the variety of countries featured in this movie, which include France, Italy, Slovenia, Germany, Finland, Portugal, Norway, Tunisia, and Iceland. Most of them chose to do what was right, or what is in the public interest/for the public good over money. In those countries, unlike in America, the citizens themselves get direct, personal benefits from paying taxes or fighting for their rights.

I guarantee it will make you jealous, and I guarantee it will make your jaw drop. But at the same time, it will fill you with hope, because as Michael Moore says at the end of the movie - all the wonderful things these other countries are doing were originally American ideas.",1466208000,,2181,4.669270833333333

Moore was caught by surprise several times in this movie.  The second time, turn on the English subtitles for the hard-of-hearing and deaf and pay close attention.  The second time you will begin to realize just how carefully constructed this film is.  It starts out light-hearted with the Italy and France segments.  Then Moore slowly and steadily cranks up the shame level with each new segment.  By the end of the Germany segment, anyone with a conscience will be squirming.  Near the end of the movie at the end of the Iceland segment, an Icelandic woman gets her ""two minutes"" and proceeds to give the United States the most effective short tongue-lashing I've ever heard.  Even Moore is squirming this time -- like a schoolboy being scolded by a teacher.  This movie really needs to be shown in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.  I wonder how many of our representatives and senators would scoff and walk out?

And, in true Michael Moore style, he's starting with an awkward concept to tie his segments together. That's almost embarrassing at times.

However, I can forgive him those moments, because this information is stunning. I'm not sure it's as much of a punch to the gut as ""Sicko"" was, or as profound as ""Capitalism,"" and I think ""Sicko"" is a better starting point if you're new to Moore's views.

Nevertheless, after seeing the first 15 minutes (or so) of this film, I went around the house muttering, ""Italy... ITALY, for heaven's sake!"" (My daughter said my muttering reminded her of a similar line in the romantic comedy movie, ""Only You."")

We are also deliberately kept ignorant about the rest of the world and how much better many countries treat their citizens - since our school systems pretend that most of the world outside of Mexico, Canada and a few large countries in Europe and Asia - simply don't exist.

He visits Italy, France, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Slovenia (where's that?; kidding Slovenians), Tunisia, Portugal. Did I miss one? Concepts once promoted in the US such as equality for all (women, ethnics, etc.); free education & health care for all; incarceration, recidivism, rehabilitation of criminals; workers having a say in their futures; high wages & health oriented working conditions w/paid leave, all seem to be thriving everywhere else. So he's off to steal them back to the US. Of course the very wealthy along w/ corporate interests lobby and donate to defeat such immoral (in the sense that it's a little smidgen off of their obsession to posses as much as possible.)

Interestingly he did not invade Cuba because, and surprising to many, are the well known (at least outside the US) facts that Cubans have free education at all levels; free health care; live longer than in the US; are happier; provide more medical personal to serve parts of the world that need it the most than we do.",1463961600,,1285,5.0046728971962615

7688342,3,B01CPU8ON2,"It's become easy to dismiss Michael Moore as just a partisan political firebrand, especially if you follow his occasional Twitter rants, but when he puts his mind to a subject he's capable of moving the national discussion. As the country's most accomplished documentarian he's tackled gun control with his breakout film, ""Bowling for Columbine"", exposed George W. Bush's lies with ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", and gave a gloomy assessment of the healthcare and financial crises with ""Sicko"" and ""Capitalism: A Love Story"". Moore's latest film, ""Where to Invade Next"", is like a playlist of his greatest hits, and while it's his most enjoyable, light-hearted doc in years, it also feels like material he's already covered.

Moore went down a doom 'n gloom path for a lot of years, but with ""Where to Invade Next"" he's back to having fun with important issues again. The title suggests an indictment of the military industrial complex but it's anything but that. Instead, Moore dreams up a silly premise that remains worthy of a chuckle throughout, that he's been tasked by the U.S. government to ""invade"" other countries and steal their best ideas. Since the U.S. routinely ranks at the bottom of the charts when it comes to living standards, this gives Moore an easy route to cherry-picking what works elsewhere without looking like he's denigating the U.S., a charge often levied against him. It also gives him cover from those who will complain he's leaving out the negative aspects of these other countries.

Literally planting his flag all across Europe, Moore interviews workers in Italy, who get months of paid vacation and maternity leave, something they can't believe isn't available here. Moore swipes that idea, then jets off to France to investigate their education system, which includes gourmet food for the students, at a much lower cost than we spend here. Each stop is like a mini movie unto itself, with Moore becoming more astonished at every turn. When Moore stops to visit Norway's posh rehabilitative prisons, one wonders if he'll just cut the film and move in himself he's so taken with the idea. But that's kind of the point. Moore's energy and enthusiasm is effective in pinpointing how deeply he cares about the values he feels are missing in America today, and yet can be found elsewhere. There was a time when the idea of a for-profit prison system would have been cause for a national uproar, but now we have them in every state and it's disgusting. In his way, Moore is trying to raise awareness to a number of topics that have been buried for far too long.

That said, Moore's kind of repeating himself here. Every one of these subjects have been visited by Moore in deeper fashion elsewhere. The only difference, and it's a big one, is Moore's jovial, mischievous demeanor, which keeps the film light as it pushes through the overlong 110-minute runtime. Nobody is ever going to accuse him of being an accomplished visual director, but Moore knows how to pick just the right images, he knows how to pick just the right interview subjects (everyone's happy and beautiful and perfect) to get his message across. While Moore's focus is a little scattered, ""Where to Invade Next"" is the filmmaker once again pushing for America to reach its full potential, even if that means looking outside our borders for inspiration.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-To-Invade-Next/dp/B01D0D3P5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where To Invade Next</a>",1463788800,8,3494,5.137082601054481

He has his normal sarcastic tone at times but is overall positive in his approach to ""invading"" other countries to steal their best ideas. I am not sure off the top of my head what the official rating on this is but I would say that it is appropriate for most ages, as long as your child can engage in thoughtful conversation they just might be able to learn something positive about these types of ideas that exist in other parts of the world. The news nowadays has so many stories about the things going wrong in our country that this offers up one set of ideas to begin to think about the ways that we could change the status quo. Highly recommend. And obviously there's a fair amount of satire and it cannot possibly be comprehensive when pulled into a two hour format but it is meant to get you to think and it accomplishes that goal quite nicely.",1463443200,3,1119,4.358851674641149

I know of several Americans who are outstanding human beings. How they must weep for what their country has become.
If every American were to see this, I would expect that so many Americans would want to emigrate that the government would have to build an American version of the ""Berlin Wall"" to prevent them leaving via Canada and Mexico.

He takes us on a tour of different countries who have policies--written into their laws and effectively implemented--that elevate ALL their citizens and value human dignity. There are so many scenes you could never find in the U.S., although many of us here hope they'll someday exist.

The film has given me hope for the human race. Not for the U.S. in my lifetime, but for the human race, as Moore shows us some cultures actually DO value human dignity. The U.S. does not. CLEARLY.

Such an appropriate time for Americans to be viewing this film because maybe we will begin to realize that we have been denied much of what others take for granted: weeks of paid family leave for vacations and childbirths; strong unions that work with governments in providing workers with sensible benefits; criminal justice systems that treat prisoners humanely; tuition-free university education; school systems that expose all students to the same education and benefits.

All we need to do is continue to elect the worst and most corrupt corporate-puppet leaders and Congressional members in the world, and then simply be as apathetic as possible and do nothing to alter that system, and then just sit back and watch more re-runs of Gilligan's Island on TV, and we can achieve the same level of national corruption as, say Nazi Germany, or Stalinist Russia, or Pol Pot's Cambodia, etc.

Never under-estimate the power of apathy!

And, oh yes, make damned sure you study no history and be an amnesiatic as possible about what's happened to America before now.  Ensure that you're not educated about any of this kind of Progressive stuff.  Make sure you deny that there's anything that needs fixing!  Make sure you deny that Global Warming exists.  Deny, deny, deny!  (A free sandbox can be sent to you for you to stick your head into if you want.)

And be careful not to listen to any ideas or sign any petitions for any Progressive changes from various liberal activist organizations, too.  Be as apathetic about investigating these new ideas and organizations as possible,  We can't afford to do anything like this if we want to be the most corrupt nation on Earth that the rest of the world already hates.

Harrassed to exhaustion by our adherence to the bogus idea of eternally increasing productivity and ever ready to fear the latest ""other"" our leaders  create for us, we have lost our passion and vision. Vacations, if we can afford one, are few and far between.

 I have personally watch the decline of a family member under our ""take it or leave it, system of employee abuse by corporate raders. Constant cuts to workforce while making the lives of those who remain unbearable has become the norm. The lack of any  social safety net or union controls has translated into a culture of abuse . Those who fall exhausted under the wheels of industry are demonized as ""lazy"" by a continuing political discourse that encourages hate towards anyone who isn't as miserably over worked as their neighbor. Nothing is being done to address the changes technolgy has brought to the workplace .. Tell me..how many times can a person sell their home before they have any equity, end their wife's current employment and uproot their family with no help from their employer in order to meet their latest corporate""demand"". At the same time we crush our children's creativity with a corporate run educational system designed to make them expect even less freedom of thought and action than what is slowly killing their parents.

Since I retired people keep asking me what I'm doing with my ""time"". Michael put my answer on film...I'm LIVING. I'm drawing, writing, playing music, talking with young people about their futures and often...just thinking and dreaming ..knowing how lucky I am to be one of the few people in America who can do that....It is sad that the average American no longer knows what living is and has no concept of community...We need to take a hard look at the future being planned for us...if you can call it that..",1463270400,35,2041,4.803418803418803

7688377,4,B01CPU8ON2,"Where to Invade Next is Michael Moores one-man excursion around the world to find countries that have great social programs for their citizens. As he states at the outset, the countries he will visit have their problems but hes there to highlight the good, not the bad. His goal: to take the best ideas back to America.

He begins in Italy by interviewing a young couple who tell him about the six-week paid vacations provided by their employer, enabling them to travel, relax, and enjoy family time. They are stunned to learn that the typical vacation for an American is two weeks, and that there is no guarantee whatsoever of vacation time. They simply cannot fathom this.

In France, he visits a middle-school cafeteria where kids are served freshly cooked meals worthy of a gourmet. He says the French manage to feed the kids nutritious meals at a fraction of the cost in Americas schools. Shown a photo of a typical American school lunch, the kids faces register both dismay and disgust.

In Slovenia, Moore learns that college tuition is free. In Norway, a prison looks more like a dormitory, with private bathrooms, TVs, and no uniforms. Tunisia, a Muslim country, provides government-subsidized abortions. Germany is open about its tarnished history and makes it part of the required school curriculum rather than pretending the Nazi regime never existed or making excuses for it. Finland boasts the worlds top educational system, but its students get no homework, have more recess, and take no standardized tests. In Portugal, recreational drugs are not against the law.

A major segment of the film focuses on the role of women in politics, with Moore speculating that there might be fewer wars if women were in control. He interviews Vigdis Finnbogadottir, president of Iceland from 1980 to 1996, the first woman in the world to become head of state in a national election.

Moore lugs around an American flag and each time he encounters an idea worth importing to the United States, he playfully plants the flag and declares that he is taking the idea back home. Late in the film, he reveals that many of the programs and policies in force in the nations he visited had their genesis in America but, over time, were either abandoned or improved. In other words, America had these ideas first.

The film doesnt have the edginess of some of Moores earlier documentaries, or their serious undertone. This is Moore-lite  an interesting travelogue offering some facts mostly about European nations (Tunisia is the exception) that should make American politicians ashamed of themselves. Moore is the laid-back, rumpled narrator who visits average citizens, government workers, employers, and bureaucrats, asking questions and feigning surprise and astonishment as he learns how humane and sensible many of their countries' programs and policies are.

The film lacks a cohesive feel, since occasionally Moore goes off on tangents such as showcasing a group of female Norwegian CEOs or walking beside a remnant of the Berlin wall, now crumbling and pitted with holes, reminding us how it was eventually brought down by people willing to protest. It seems there could be two different movies here. The film starts well, hopping from one country to another at a brisk pace, but tends to get mired later in an overload of content. Some pruning would have improved the movie.

Moore has been known to be aggressive, abrasive, and downright obnoxious in his quest for exciting cinematic moments, but here he is uncharacteristically calm and polite as he leisurely interviews folks, provides on-screen narration to tie segments together, and draws conclusions from his research. He is one of the few documentary directors who can get financing, make films, and get them shown theatrically. Whether you agree with his politics or not, he is an astute director with an observant eye. This, combined with his gentle sense of irony, makes for a winning combination in Where to Invade Next. The film is rated R.

There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release.",1462838400,54,4068,5.0222551928783385

It as if the film were threatening to American exceptionalism, that we are the greatest country in the world.

8753667,5,B01CPU8ON2,Illustrates so very well how insular Americans are but the message is also of hope that Americans can pull their finger out and save themselves,1536883200,,143,4.76
8753668,4,B01CPU8ON2,"I start with a disclaimer that I am a MODERATE leaning towards Liberal (Social Capitalist). Michael Moore, to me represents exactly me as a Person except on certain points where he extends more on the Socialist side than Capitalist side. First, let me start with 'AMERICA is a GREAT COUNTRY' compared with many many countries in the world in terms of Economy, National Security, Governance, Inequality (Less Inequality), Law & Order, Freedom, Sports, Invention and high Respect to Individuals. Obviously, just like any other country, America has it's own flaws and Michael Moore addresses those issues in a more constructive ways by comparing with other countries who have a better system in terms of Healthcare, College Education, Public Transportation, Farm-Fresh Organic Food and Work-Life Balance. Let me also clarify that the above issues such as Healthcare and College is NOT extremely bad in America as claimed but certainly not very good and can be rated as 'Average'. The so called Social Capitalist country in Europe (Leaning more towards Socialism than Capitalism) has done well in all the above parameters and the No. 1 reason being that these countries are TAXING their people heavily!!

Many Americans claim that Taxes are very high in USA which is NOT true compared to many developed countries in Europe. European Socialist countries tax its People with higher personal Income Tax rate compared to US Tax rates (Average Net Effective Tax Rates that includes all FED/STATE/SALES/PROPERTY/LOCAL Taxes) and that's one of the reason why these Governments could spend liberally on Education as well as Health which is FREE as per Europeans but actually it's NOT FREE as the money comes from Personal Income Tax:-)

An Average European in Sweden or Norway or Finland pays around 40% in personal taxes alone whereas an average American pays  25% as total taxes (Excluding Social Security and Medicare Tax which is a benefit tax that benefits everyone of us in longer term). In addition to that, almost every American has to pay additional Insurance premium for healthcare to get private health insurance which costs more. Let's consider that if US Govt. taxes another 3% to 5% as special health care tax, then UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE can be obtained freely to everyone which means with average 30% Tax Rates, USA is still a better country compared to other developed European Countries.

In terms of Education, School Education is almost free in USA (Obviously it's not free as it's funded by local property taxes:-)) but College Education especially in the last 20 years or so has skyrocketed beating inflation rates by a huge margin and USA has a problem. The reason behind US College Education is funding from State Govt's are getting reduced and only 35% of education costs are funded by State's and the remaining 65% has to be borne by individuals. I hope if State Govt. squeezes it's budget and reduces unnecessary pilferage, and if they could fund 50% of college education, then individuals can fund the remaining 50% and there should be a cap that College Costs should not be hiked more than the inflation rate and should be capped by CPI growth. Moreover, if corporates take social responsibility and fund another 10% to colleges for Merit-based students (FED can grant special Tax Credit for Corporate Taxes), the college costs can be further reduced which means students can fund 40% personally which they can manage partly with reduced student loans. I agree that European Model of free college education is good where USA will find difficult to beat.

However, having experienced life in Europe and Asia, there are many impressive factors about USA such as INVENTION and INNOVATION that is constantly happening in USA for the past 100 years or so which means USA always creates JOBS to tons of people not only within America but also to the entire world (Amazon/Uber/Airbnb are few examples).

The Social Capitalist developed countries in Europe also have several problems like not enough research is happening and not many jobs are created due to less invention(GERMANY is an exception), People get stagnated in the career as they rely on 'Welfare' and are not willing to learn new things which makes them lazy, Entrepreneurs are hesitant to start new businesses due to tons of laws/regulation/taxes and high cost of running business, High cost of Living along with less pay compared to Americans (Maybe not that less but average is at least 10% lesser)  et al but they do have excellent public transportation in terms of outstanding super-fast trains, buses and good quality food which USA will find tough to beat as the entire system in USA is built around CAR's and due to extreme oversize in terms of its geography, public transportation cannot be carried out effectively due to poor patronage!!

Well in terms of Fresh Foods, European Union is strict as they have very few/less GMO foods and most of the food they eat are farm fresh and healthy. No doubt, Europe is way ahead in terms of food quality as US lacks complete quality in foods where they monopolised the Genetically-Modified Foods with absolutely NO TASTE/FLAVOUR along with pre-processing the GMO foods which again is fed into fast-food chains that leads to Americans eating TOTAL JUNK at very low cost spoiling their health!! Hopefully, some sense happens in USA that more and more Organic foods will be consumed by consumers in near future and hope the GMO industry is completely wiped out!!

If we take overall picture into account on various parameters, USA has a system in place where citizens are paying less taxes compared to other developed countries, but enjoy few benefits too. However, USA always creates tons of jobs to its citizens due to its constant funding in Research and Invention/Innovation which means almost everyone gets a jobs which pays a decent salary ensuring moderate quality of living to all of its citizens.

Finally, the socialist countries in terms of its design do NOT creates enough jobs for its own people and we all know how extreme socialism is so dangerous as power will rely on few people where they get completely corrupted (COMMUNIST RUSSIA/CUBA/Venezuela/Yogoslavia/EASTERN EUROPE et al) and rest of people has become so poor in terms of quality of living.

My humble suggestion is that USA is doing well as of now except in Healthcare, Food and College Education and hope we follow UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE with a moderate increase in our taxes along with STATE/COMPANY sponsored College Education so that we become a MODEST and MODERATE CAPITALIST Country instead of Total Free LIBERAL Country. Regarding Food, there is no quick fix solution unless congress comes out with a law banning all GMO food and hopefully Amazon's Whole Foods promotes Organic food only to ensure everyone is healthy.

My rating on the movie is '5 Star' for Michael Moore as a 'Complete Honest and American-Loving' person who brutally exposes the truth and am giving 3 and half Star for the Movie itself as I want to take 1 and half Star due to failure in not showing how social capitalist are suffering in not creating enough jobs as well as not showing high taxes the social capitalist people are paying!! The Final rating is '4 Stars' if I average the above!!",1535155200,,7264,4.984323432343234
