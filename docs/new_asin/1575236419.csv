7798845,5,1575236419,"Veteran actor Lance Henriksen (Stone Cold, Aliens) again sets himself apart in this low-budget thriller with his ""mad man behind the scenes"" character that serves him so well. Always setting himself apart someway, be it dress, behavior or both, to create a stand-out bad guy. He is joined with other low-budget film greats that have proved their merit. Bruce Payne (Warlock III), Shannon Tweed (No Contest) and Jayne Heitmeyer (Sci-Fighters). Ms. Tweed kicks [behind] to save the day in this action thriller. But it's really great to get to see this many low-budget actors working together. Surely they had fun. The film is worth a look and one to buy if you collect Mr. Henriksen's works.",1003622400,16,689,4.948275862068965
7798846,4,1575236419,"As far as sequels go, this one doesn't quite match the fun of No Contest, however Shannon Tweed, Lance Henricksen and Bruce Payne seem to be having a good time with their roles. Worth owning.",941846400,10,191,4.485714285714286
