2509601,4,B000E8JNQ0,"I have to admit up until I watched this dvd the other day I'd never read or seen anything by Shaw, so this was, in a sense, a really pleasant new experience for me.  Given this, though, perhaps not in the best position to provide a reliable critique, so I won't even venture an attempt.  Generally speaking, it seems to me that ""Arms in the Man"" isn't all that original (perhaps it was in its time) and the ending wasn't exactly unpredictable.  Still, quite enjoyable to watch; the presence of Bonham-Carter alone makes it worthwhile.  But to be honest, I preferred watching ""The Man of Destiny.""  An interesting study in characted, with sharp and witty dialogue.  Callow is truly a superb actor.",1171670400,7,696,4.663934426229508
2509602,4,B000E8JNQ0,"The characterizations and direction were all excellent; maybe Bluntschli seemed a little young and 'smooth'.  The voices were easily understandable, in contrast to many new TV dramas where the speech is so fast that older people like us (79) simply can't follow!  We guess there aren't many versions of this to choose from, but we'd certainly recommend it -- it's one of Shaw's favorite plays for us.  F.J.H. and I.R.H.",1168819200,14,419,4.957142857142857
2509603,5,B000E8JNQ0,"I almost didn't buy this because, although I have always enormously enjoyed reading this play, I had a sneaking suspicion that it would be impossible to stage well. So many of the characters spend so much time being histrionic if not idiotic, and I was afraid that what was charming and funny in print might prove to be merely irritating when portrayed by an actual flesh-and-blood human.

But I am delighted to say that I was wrong; this performance was delightful.  Much of the credit must go to a really lovely performance by Helena Bonham Carter that gives Raina exactly the right balance of real wit and gallantry with extraordinarily silly romanticism.  The other performances were all also excellent; not one struck me as off or untrue to my readings of the play, though I could wish that the Sergious had been toned down just a tad.

It's really a very delightful story, and this performance is a keeper.  If you know the play and are looking to see it performed, I recommend this wholeheartedly; if you don't know the play but are looking to see a very nice production of one of Shaw's lightest and funniest plays (well suited to kids -- I loved it when I was 12 or so) then this might an excellent option to consider.",1157500800,57,1227,4.5590909090909095
2509604,5,B000E8JNQ0,"I will admit that I purchased this title thinking it would give me advice on how to use my arms.  I am a man and I have arms, even though for many years I did not use them.  Exercising with Aquabells dumbells have allowed me to regain strength in and use of my arms, and now I wanted to get to the next level of arms care.

Instead of a how-to video on arms, ""Arms and the Man"" is a 1989 BBC production of the 1894 George Bernard Shaw play he subtitled ""An Anti-Romantic Comedy"".  The distinctly English Helena Bonham-Carter plays a Bulgarian living in 1885 at the end of the two-week Serbo-Bulgarian war.  That in itself is pretty farcical.  Not the war per se, because state-sponsored killing is still killing, but the fact that the war epitomized the vain and nationalistic European wars of the 18th and 19th centuries.  No borders changed, but Bulgarian unification became internationally recognized and the Serbians found another reason to hold a bloody grudge.  Also Helena Bonham-Carter playing a Hungarian is farcical, since she is English and doesn't look particularly Bulgarian, although my only experience with Bulgarians is watching Bulgarian powerlifters during Olympic games, so I really can't be counted on to know Bulgarian physiognomy.

The real farce, however, is Shaw's use of the conventions of romantic comedy to subvert romantic and idealized notions of warfare.  Captain Bluntschli, a Swiss mercenary fighting for the Serbs, hides in the bedroom of young Bulgarian Raina Petkoff, played by a young Ms. Bonham-Carter.  While hiding from the victorious Bulgarians, Bluntschli disabuses the nave Raina of the heroic efforts of her fiance, Sergius, in winning the war, as well as the nobility of warfare and soldiers in general.

In the second act, the war is over and Sergius and Raina are together again.  Each goes through the postures of romance even while Sergius pursues the family maid Louka, played by a young Patsy Kensit, on the side.  Patsy Kensit is not on her side, but rather Sergius pursues her that way.  Actually, Sergius is not on his side either, but rather the pursuit itself is done discreetly.  As discreet, however, as nosy servants will allow.  Bluntschli reappears to return a borrowed coat and is welcomed by Sergius and the patriarch Major Petkoff, both of whom hold no grudges from the war, since they won.  The third act brings out the truth of both Sergius and Bluntschli, and Raina finds herself much wiser, if not happier, and about to be married to someone.

As with most BBC productions, ""Arms and the Man"" boasts an excellent cast with crisp performances, and as with most early Shaw, ""Arms and the Man"" adopts the ideals of well-known dramatic conceits and gestures only to puncture them with the realities of imperfect life and non-ideal characters.  These reasons alone would be enough to recommend the DVD.  The inclusion, however, on the DVD of the bonus play ""The Man of Destiny"" (1981), starring a young Simon Callow, fairly well demands, in a polite and enthusiastic way, that everyone obtain this DVD, especially by fans of Shaw, Ms. Bonham-Carter, war, romance, heroism, or Bulgarians.",1148860800,50,3149,4.926136363636363
2509605,5,B000E8JNQ0,I love my movie collection 97% was bought from amazon I will continue to collect and I do from this sight and all movies were in excellent condition whether bought pre-owned or brand new not once did I receive a broke or scratched movie . Just make sure you read about the seller that they have good scores and reviews.,1374278400,,319,4.333333333333333
2509606,5,B000E8JNQ0,"Helena Bonham-Carter is such a drama queen!!!  She really played her character very well.  The story line is kinda cheesy, but delightful.  A great family movie to watch with the kids, Well maybe just your daughters!  We just cracked up about this crazy family!  My 15 year old son didn't like it too much.  A great movie when your bored and want a laugh and to talk about some silly acting people.  Although this is not a great production or great quality to the movie itself, it was enjoyable for my daughter and I to watch together.  We liked it.",1355356800,,549,4.42
2509607,1,B000E8JNQ0,This is so ridiculous I shut it off after a few moments - I still have not watched it all the way through!,1289952000,,106,3.652173913043478
2509608,5,B000E8JNQ0,"This is my favorite Shaw play.  I first saw it performed at the old Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis when Michael Moriarty played the roll of the Swiss mercenary soldier, Captain Bluntschli.  I was delighted with it then, and I have to admit it still pleases me now.  At the time, the Viet Nam war was in progress, and the play seemed to resonate with my own feelings about it.

Like most of Shaw's plays, Arms and the Man deals with a social ill---in this case war---by making fun of the behavior.  As the author tells us through the dialogue, war is only glorious to those who've never faced the bloodshed and the deprivation of it.  The author implies that the audience, safe in its ignorance, is just as naive as the Bulgarian girl Raina.  Men die horrible deaths, while other men escape by shear accident and others by flight.  Some of them fight for the honor and glory they think will be theirs, others for money, and some because they are compelled to do so by circumstances.  In the end everyone goes home, and even enemies become friends.  So what was the fight really about?  What's the point?  It's a very good question, and one that has yet to be answered.  Shaw wrote the play in 1894 to standing ovations--only one person in the audience booed, and Shaw, ever the wit, said, ""My dear fellow, I quite agree with you, but what are we two against so many?""  Yet World War I and World War II were still to come, and Shaw himself lived to see both of them.  (He died in 1950).

The BBC production is a delight.  Helena Bonham Carter, in a roll early in her career, plays the young Raina Petkoff to whose room the Swiss soldier retreats.  Her portrayal of the proud local aristocrat is delightful.  At one point she seeks to impress by stating that she washes her hands at least once a day, and that her house is quite splendid because it has real stairs by which to climb to the second floor.  Her attitude towards war and its glory is a perfect foil for that of Pip Torrens' Captain Bluntschli, who sees it for what it is: something to be gotten through by whatever means possible.  The real star of the presentation, however, is a young Nicholas Chagrin, whose Sergai is quintessential: part baffoon, part acrobat.  He reveals to the audience the weaknesses behind the facade of bravado; he is both hero and fool.  Of all the characters, his is the one who learns most about himself.  Probably the wisest of the characters is Nicola, who reveals to us that everyone is someone's servant and that there are trade offs to be made in every life and at every level of society.

Because the production is an older one, it has the feel of a stage production.  Even action that takes place outdoors is performed on a stage set, so the entire work has the character of theater as opposed to TV or cinema.  In short it has a more intimate ambiance.  For anyone who has not had the opportunity to attend a live performance, this will give you at least an inkling of what live theater is like.  Since the audience to some extent participates in the production---at least in so far as it suspends disbelief and provides feedback to the actors---it is a much more active experience than TV.",1281312000,5,3187,4.465397923875432
2509609,1,B000E8JNQ0,bad movie more like bad theater... it was like a bad play that was taped and put on film could not stand to watch,1264896000,,113,3.75
2509610,1,B000E8JNQ0,"I would only give this a higher rating ""IF"" I were in NY live in the audience watching ""the play"" and then only if a relative or friend was playing a part that required me to be there.  I could barely make if through the first 15 minutes.",1263254400,2,238,3.9583333333333335
2509611,4,B000E8JNQ0,"I enjoyed watching ""Arms and the Man"" (starring Helena Bonham Carter) and ""Man of Destiny"" (starring Simon Callow). The acting for both films was pretty good, and the setting was adequate.

Both films (based on plays of the same name) poke fun at some aspect of war. (Bernard Shaw was not in favor of war, thinking it would be better for the soldiers to shoot their generals and go home.)

This said, the films follow the scripts of the plays quite loyally. Occasionally, the setting is changed to allow for the fact that the plays are not being performed on a stage but rather being performed like the productions in the Charles Dickens BBC collection or Jane Austen BBC collection.

One warning:
Subtitles are not included in the films. Therefore, you may wish to follow along with the scripts of the plays, which you could print off from most literary internet sites such as Wikepedia. Sometimes it is difficult to follow the arguments of the characters because the language is so different from that spoken today.",1262822400,4,1017,4.767045454545454

2509613,5,B000E8JNQ0,"Good adaptation of the shaw play. Basically a play about the futility of war,honor, and the human condition. Slightly dated but still effective view of mankind and the upper classes in particular and their pretensions
and foibles.",1216339200,3,230,5.243243243243243
2509614,3,B000E8JNQ0,"I am an unabashed Anglophile and have read this play several times and loved it, so I was excited to see the DVD.  But I expected something more modern, more realistic, less hokey.  Maybe I tried to watch it too late at night, as I kept falling asleep. I prefer the characters in my imagination to the actors on this DVD.",1178409600,7,321,4.245901639344262

8107218,4,B000E8JNQ0,"Really very good! Helena Bonham-Carter is right on cue but I fault the casting of other characters, especially that of Sergius. He is silly-looking (supposed to be ""romantically handsome"" according to Shaw.  He is also very old-looking with a deeply lined forehead and his acting is more vaudeville than satire.
The actress who plays Louka also bugs me, since she looks like a fragile English rose rather than a sassy and vivacious Bulgarian beauty hell-bent on social climbing.
But Bluntschli is superb, and the rest of the cast make a fine ensemble. The play is delightful despite the rather unnecessary farm animals!",1434067200,4,619,5.068627450980392

8107220,5,B000E8JNQ0,"Though I thought these BBC productions a bit dated, it was really interesting to see many of these actors I am familiar with in twentieth century productions when they where youthful in their acting careers with BBC acting still performing now in the twenty-first century.  You really see how these actors where going to become the great actors they are now.  The evolution in these actors performance is delightful to witness in these early performances of BBC.",1414886400,3,462,4.987012987012987

8107222,5,B000E8JNQ0,"This is an excellent production of the play, almost up to my favorite theater version that starred Richard Briers as Bluntschli and Alice Krige as Raina. I saw that four times in London, and am very sorry that they didn't make a movie of it (there was no DVD in those days). I've seen the play performed many times in many places, including Cambridge, Mass; Karachi, Pakistan (by the Old Vic Company); Lahore, Pakistan (in which Bluntschli was played by Geoffrey Kendall of ""Shakespeare Wallah"" and father of Felicity Kendall), as well as in Oxford and Cambridge, England) and it never fails to amuse and entertain. I watch the version sold here about once a year. I hope you will enjoy it too.",1392940800,,694,4.650406504065041
8107223,5,B000E8JNQ0,"This item , i ordered to compllete my Helena Bonham carter Collection. A fine Comedy  by George Bernhard Shaw.
A wonderful funny and charming comedy. Great entertainment and precise picture on reality of Men and their behaviour.
Well this also goes for the  women involved. Fine sense of humour is applied on the misonception of wartime and romance.
Highly recommended for a nice relaxing evening. Great cast of actors!",1389484800,2,419,5.057971014492754
