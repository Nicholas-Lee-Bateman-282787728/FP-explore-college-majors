3646734,5,B001IBIDLI,"This is the funniest series I've seen in along time. With only 6 episodes in season 1 you'll be left wanting more. Sarcastic, fun loving assh*le genius Danny McBride with guest appearance Will Ferrell, tie this show into a comedy that leaves you covering your face in embarrassment, wondering how they got the balls create such a gem.

Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. Underrated as hell, spread the word. Kudos, Danny McBride.

Also see the ""Foot Fist Way"" if you like this DVD.",1237766400,62,488,4.597701149425287
3646735,5,B001IBIDLI,"Danny McBride has found something special in KENNY POWERS. Though Kenny's life states to be ruled by talent and the grace of god. In fact  his life is almost complete anarchy riddled with drugs, loose women, and a wall of denial. However even within only 6 episodes you see something change. This man starts to find his way out of the darkness. Danny McBride delivers some of the best SELF ABUSE humor ever. THIS BY FAR IS THE BEST SHOW ON TV. Is it better to burn out or fade away? Do we need a 2nd season, have we burned all the bridges, uncovered all of Kenny's stones? Even if the idiots at network don't renew the series,with only 6 episodes deep it will stand on it's own to become an instant cult classic.",1237593600,27,712,4.313432835820896

3646738,2,B001IBIDLI,"HBO generally puts out a high quality product, so I'm not sure what went wrong here. The best I can say, really, is that I've seen worse. I get that some people like this kind of stuff, and it definitely has it's moments - even if they are few and far apart. However ultimately it's little more than several dirty jokes told over and over in various guises of a story. If that's your thing then you'll be really happy with this. It's just not my thing.",1515024000,,452,4.206896551724138

3646754,1,B001IBIDLI,"His is a personality type I recognized but had to ponder a bit before realizing the definition.  He's a psychopath.

He has a unique way of being ""self-righteous"" and high-minded at supposed disappointing behaviors in others, when they don't satisfy his self interests (and ego) enough to suit him.  And too, they may be too mentally strong for him to bully.  So, the psychopath, as illustrated in this series, can twist logic around that some normal people can't quite deal with and so just opt to yield to his point-of-view and accept him (wrongly) as he presents himself, when really he is the skilled and manipulative tactician totally out to feed his own benefit.  And he uses his shocking and blatant crudities and profanities to constantly knock his victims off balance, a place where every psychopath thrives.

So, here is a series built around psychopathic behavior that is not enjoyable to watch, and where the syndrome is not a key and identified element in the storyline.  We're supposed to think it's normal and amusing?  You have an ongoing theme of sporadic chaos led by a bullying crude manipulator whom everyone enables, and we are supposed to see it as comedy?  I really find little enjoyment in this.

I suppose the character might develop into something ""normal"" later in the series?  As if that makes any sense in any other world other than this fantasy.  Nah.  I have far better things to watch.",1497916800,,1417,4.805785123966942

3646757,1,B001IBIDLI,"This series is decidedly unfunny. If there are any actual writers on this show, they can't be more than 12 years old. The utter lack of humor makes this almost painful to witness. The lead character is an awful human being, and if I were to care enough about wanting anything for him, it would be for him to get run over by a semi-truck or to drown. One doesn't watch this show, one endures it. I can envision Trump liking this show.",1494201600,,433,4.228915662650603

3646763,5,B001IBIDLI,overall 10/10 would reccomend to a friend. would use this show with your girlfriend to have sex after each episode. now that we have finished the entire series all we do is have sex because theres no better show out there,1488844800,,221,4.414634146341464
3646764,3,B001IBIDLI,Started of slow but got better with each episode. Took time for character development. But I definitely appreciated the characters over the top personalities. I think ex ball players would like this series.,1487289600,,206,5.2727272727272725
3646765,4,B001IBIDLI,"I thought I would get too annoyed with the character to get past a whole season.  But I've watched all of them and am cycling through again currently.  The only issue is eventually I started pulling for Kenny somewhat - either to get back to the Majors or to become a better person.  This got a little in the way of enjoying the humor, but that's only the difference between 4 and 5 stars.  The humor is vulgar and juvenile, but done right for vulgar and juvenile humor.

The best part of the show is really his friend Stevie.  I just hope there aren't any real people like him.  He serves as a someone of a foil to Kenny.  Kenny's character needs other characters who are meaner, more evil, and more dangerous to make him seem more reasonable.  Stevie plays the role of more dangerous, but less mean and less evil.

You'll ask yourself why you're watching it and how they could make a show like this, but you'll enjoy it.  Just make sure shopping for toilet humor is what you're after.",1487116800,,986,4.362637362637362

I binged watched the whole show and really got into it.  His personality is unique, quirky, absurd, hilarious and simultaneously lovable.  I particularly love the fact that you get to really experience Kenny as weak & vulnerable at times when he is emotionally broken, and then you cheer when he discovers what he needs to cure his problem (support from his wife etc.) and goes on to succeed.

3647736,5,B001IBIDLI,"5 stars for a unique show and execution. I think crude and vulgar aren't generally funny - it's far too easy and rarely clever. The show is scripted like people actually speak - inane, but somehow it's hilarious.  Never a dull or pointless scene. One of the few shows you must actually sit, watch, and listen to - the entire show. Great to watch non-reality TV with scripts, writing, and acting. Danny McBride is brilliant and inspired, again, as a total ass. An epic one.  Any of his characters' appearances alone are killer - you can just look and know, that guy's an ass.  There is always a small taste of balance - the ass is not only presented as a shallow, 2 dimensional, cartoon.  There are occasional brief moments of slight depth and almost sympathy - just enough to keep the character real, not manipulate you.  It's hard for me to laugh at a loser, and to keep watching them be losers. Danny McBride strikes a brilliant and wildly entertaining, totally skewed, not overly balanced, balance between utter, inane, vulgar, bull and pure entertainment.",1472083200,8,1059,4.702702702702703

3647744,5,B001IBIDLI,Season 1 of this show is the best one. They should have only made the 1st season and quit so every episode of this show would have been a classic,1471737600,,145,3.8666666666666667

8310729,1,B001IBIDLI,Non stop foul language spewing from the mouth of an egomaniac...couldn't get past the first 20 minutes to go on any farther. This is one of the worst shows I've had the misfortune to see.,1526774400,,187,4.371428571428571
8310730,5,B001IBIDLI,"At first, I thought this would be really stupid, but I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it with my husband. We laughed our a**es off. Yes, the humor is raunchy, ridiculous, over-the-top, and immature for the most part, but the story does have heart. Danny McBride is brilliant in this role. I became a huge fan that day and have seen and loved everything he's been in since watching this.  BTW, If you haven't watched his series ""Vice Principals"", I highly recommend it! Also from HBO, it is an excellent series on its own merit, but if you like Danny McBride, you'll love it that much more. His co-star, Walton Goggins, is classic! You'll love him.",1526169600,,661,4.508333333333334
