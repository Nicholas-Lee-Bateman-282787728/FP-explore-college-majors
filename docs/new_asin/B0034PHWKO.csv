8388509,2,B0034PHWKO,"Kevin Carraway and Lawrence  Sara.  Man, there's a moviemaking duo.  Last September I reviewed their 2012 collaboration, 7 BELOW (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C4GSSY2NLSHG/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006WQHP4A&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=).  I recently saw their previous movie THE FEAR CHAMBER and I have to say, maybe making horror movies isn't their thing.

In this one, Detective Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles, TRANSMORPHERS) has been on the trail of a serial killer in LA for some time and, as the movie starts, he's sneaking into the killer's lair just as the killer, Teddy (Richard Tyson, BATTLEFIELD EARTH), is slicing into a woman strapped to a table.  While the detective moseys his way through the building, stopping to tell a bound woman he'll be right back, the killer has time to take out one of the woman's organs, smear blood all over his face, and take pictures, before the cop finally decides to bust in and not shoot the guy.  This gives Teddy time to throw a pan at the cop and run out of the room.  Nick follows him to the roof where Teddy attacks, shoving a needle into Nick's heart and leaving him for dead.

Some time later, Nick wakes up in the hospital with a new heart and, strangely, the ability to psychically see the killer's next target.  Also, from here on out, it seems water faucets have a knack of turning themselves on whenever Nick is around.

After several weeks of recovery, Nick goes back to work, trying desperately to find this guy before he kills again.  After a chance encounter in a bar with a psychic who tells Nick she can see he has ""the sight"" as well, Nick notices on the bones of one of the victims (the killer burns the remains in acid, leaving behind only clean bones) a series of bone saw marks and tells a lab guy to run some tests and figure out exactly what brand of bone saw those marks come from.  The lab guy runs his tests and concludes the results are inconclusive as all bone saws leave identical marks.

Damn.

So Nick somehow finds out the killer's name is Teddy and he has someone look for any malpractice suits in the last five years filed against any doctors named Ted, Teddy, Theodore or any variation thereof.  One of the matches leads Nick to a dark house where he breaks into the garage and finds a severed head in a jar of formaldehyde.  He also happens to find the killer hiding under a sheet.  The killer escapes, AGAIN, and Nick is off the case.

As luck would have it, that's just the motivation he needs to, as he's threatened twice already by this point, ""go it alone"" and track this psycho down once and for all.  Mediocrity follows and Nick saves the day before the movie's final insult and, after 84 grueling minutes, we can get back to our lives.

So, here are my problems with this movie, in no particular order.

First, I'm going to start with the most obvious, which is this movie is marketed as a horror movie when, in reality, it's just a crime movie with a psychic detective.  Big whoop.  And he's not even that psychic.  He sees the killer's next victim, but that knowledge doesn't help him find the killer at all.  In fact, all of the other visions he has--his dead wife in the shower, a ghoulish looking girl loitering beside his pool--could all be easily attributed to a stressed, over-strained and slightly inebriated mind.  Other than knowing what clothes the latest victim was wearing, there's nothing about anything else the cop sees, or thinks he sees, that lends credibility to his newfound ""abilities"".

Second, our killer is completely wasted.  Teddy is obviously a madman from the first scene.  And later, when Nick finds Teddy's garage with the preserved head in it, it's discovered the head belongs to Teddy's mother.  Apparently, after the funeral, Teddy dug up the body and cut off the head, then preserved it in formaldehyde in his garage.  Nick also finds a dummy wearing part of a body suit sewn together from various women body parts.  We've got shades of Norman Bates and Jame Gumb here and we wonder if this has something to do with the way he chooses his victims.  The body is never mentioned other than Nick seeing it in the garage and it's later revealed Teddy works for a black market organ selling organization.  So, in the end, sure he's got his mother's head in a jar, but he's only killing people because he wants to ""save all the children in Africa.""  What?  That's a swing and a miss, for sure.

Then there's Carraway's direction.  It's not bad enough he's allowing his lead actor to sleepwalk through the entire movie, dropping more f-bombs that I've heard outside of a Richard Pryor concert in a long time, but a good fifteen to twenty minutes could have shaved off this movie if only we hadn't had to watch Nick wake up from his constant stream of dreams within dreams at least half a dozen times.  I mean, we see him wake up from a dream within a dream in the hospital, we see him do it at home in bed, we see  it at home on the couch a few times.  We get it, he's troubled.  Maybe if Jack Daniels wasn't his snack food of choice, he might be in a more clear mental state and better able to focus.  I know it sounds crazy, but it's worth a shot.

It's not often a movie will call attention to itself so much that I notice things like set design, but THE FEAR CHAMBER managed it several times.  For starters, Nick Ferguson is an LA cop.  A detective, granted, but still an LA cop and something tells me LA cops, regardless of their pay grade, don't make enough to live in mansions.  And if Nick's house isn't a mansion, the high end bathroom, the expensive tile and counters in the kitchen, the pool outside, still all smack of being filmed in a location other than what would normally be the home of an LA detective.  Not that they can't have nice things too, but let's be serious here.  Also, a few locations, like Nick's hospital room and his captain's office, both screams ""built on a soundstage.""  There's Nick's hospital room which has a little metal frame, glass-topped side table, about a foot square, with just a glass of water, his TV remote, and a bottle of aspirin on it.  That's not a hospital side table, I don't care how classy the hospital is.  And the captain's office is decorated with a ship's wheel on the wall, an old pair of boxing gloves hanging next to the captain's chair, and a small Yamaha home organ covered in sticky notes on the desk.  What?  It's like Nick's captain, played by Steven Williams of ""21 Jump Street"", has moved his office to the old ""Ray Bradbury Theater"" set.  One other minor glitch that bothered me: Nick turned on his stereo to listen to the news on the radio with his DirecTV remote.  I have that remote.  I don't think it would allow me to turn on a stereo, no matter how close it's sitting to the DirecTV receiver.

I could probably sit here for another hour picking apart the flaws in THE FEAR CHAMBER, but at the end of the day it all comes down to this just being a bad movie because the story sucks.  Nick's character's alcoholism and depression are way overplayed, but he's also being pitted against a ridiculously lame villain who can't decide between mommy issues and a god complex.  While the plot and the majority of the characters' actions make more sense than the Carraway/Sara follow-up three years later, considering what a total mess 7 BELOW was, that's not really saying much.  At least that movie more successfully played up the supernatural aspects of the story.  And it didn't bother with some totally lame twist ending that threatened to ruin any amount of integrity the previous 74 minutes may have built.

If you're a horror fan, you're going to be disappointed in this one, and if you're just in search of the next SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or RED DRAGON, well, you've so definitely come to the wrong place.",1368144000,,7798,4.5607476635514015
8388510,2,B0034PHWKO,"Teddy (Richard Tyson) is a female serial killer and amateur organ harvester (We all need a hobby.) Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is a detective who goes it alone against Teddy and gets a hypodermic in the heart (and later a new heart). As Nick recovers he has nightmares of dead girls in his bathroom. A card carrying psychic (Miranda Kwok) he meets at a bar tells him to use the visions to find the killer.

Nick looks for the killer by mixing alcohol with Prozac. His personal demons take up a lot of film. Steven Williams who was trooper in ""The Blues Brothers"" is now the police captain over Nick and reminds me of a younger thin Danny Glover. The movie ends with an interesting twist that wasn't enough to save it. After Keesha Smith shows us her wares in the first few minutes, the move goes downhill. Too much time was spent on the detective and not enough on the killer.

F-bomb, nudity (Keesha Smith from Big Brother)",1329696000,3,924,4.461538461538462
8388511,1,B0034PHWKO,"Insomniacs rejoice!  This yawner will put anyone to sleep.
The ""plot"" focuses on a deranged serial killer who is selling organs from his victims and the dedicated cop on his trail.  The cop is having visions and teams up with a psychic to bring him down.  Unfortunately this cop is from the Keystone Kops school of police work!
Richard Tyson as the killer And Rhett Giles as the cop are awful.  The movie is snail-paced with no suspense at all and the movie's ""twist"" laughable.
A real snoozer.",1273881600,2,494,4.579545454545454
