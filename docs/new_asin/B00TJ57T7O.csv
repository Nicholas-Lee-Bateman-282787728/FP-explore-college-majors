7010976,1,B00TJ57T7O,SO BAD! I mean truly not worth the time or money. Terrible sound quality. I'm pretty sure these college kids made this film themselves and that's nice and all but to think people should pay to watch it is basically ripping people off.,1440720000,,234,4.465116279069767
7010977,3,B00TJ57T7O,"The story is excellent. It is a good watch. But, there are a few glitches. The acting is also good overall. However, it is weak in the opening scenes... when it is most important.",1440288000,,179,4.294117647058823
7010978,4,B00TJ57T7O,"I really enjoyed this film.  It's lower budget than Neil Johnson's other films, but in my opinion it has more heart, more humanity than what he has been able to achieve with films like Starship.  I have actually watched the film 3 times already.  It reminds me of the new terminator film, in as much as you have to watch it more than once to see how the time travel is set up.  Quite a clever film and actually scientifically accurate.  I wish they had more DVD extras.  I want to know more about this film.  The main girl in the film is remarkable, as is the guy who plays Achillies.",1440028800,,584,4.207207207207207
7010979,5,B00TJ57T7O,"I found this quite entertaining as a Sci-Fi devotee. I gave the show a chance and loved it. They did a lot with the budget they had, not everything needs to be spelled out with great special effects when you give the Sci-Fi audience reasonable cause for their suspension of beliefs. What special effects they had used I thought were pretty good, the show does a great job of captivating you from the start.",1439164800,4,406,4.5
7010980,2,B00TJ57T7O,"The film starts in 2410 with narration about two factions. After 90% of the planet was destroyed, the Norwegians did genetic engineering and created ""homo-superiors"" a race that are ""bio-machine"" because if we called them cyborgs everyone would think of ""Terminator"". The bio-machines are after human Achilles (Alain Terzoli) who returns to our past and is followed back in time by a cyborg, er ah bio-machine. John Connor, aka Achilles meets with some humans who assist him against the machine as London becomes a battle ground.

The film is low budget and tries. The special effects reminded me of low end 1980s. The plot could have used some tightening up. Alain Terzoli whose vocabulary consisted mostly of nouns spoken one at a time was a bit boring. You would think for a guy who is 60 he wouldn't get so worked up over a bit of cleavage, especially being from Norway.

This is another Neil Johnson film of ""Alien Dawn"" series fame. He takes pride in making films on a budget, unfortunately he writes his own scripts.

7010981,1,B00TJ57T7O,Literally the WORST movie I have ever seen.  Absolutely terrible.,1439078400,,65,5.5
8701985,3,B00TJ57T7O,"There is some interesting undertones to the movie, not exactly sure what the point of it is.... Seems the point is humans go from bad to worst... and basically decided to annihilate conscience? and become their own gods? a bit of a heathen leant to it. It was slow a dramatic when it should speed up and wasn't clear on the purpose of characters except to walk the viewer through  story background. So what if the lady lives to be 200 years old? What was the purpose for it? Etc... not very conclusive. Beginning was okay once it got to the two human characters but it never picked up the questions I had and I ended up skipping through it at places because it seemed to have a lot of no point time wasting music that didn't fit or accomplish anything but to aggravate me so almost didn't finish it, but I like to see movie ends so skipped ahead... to an inconclusive end. Acting liked and characters just a bit more needs to be done on pulling together the focus in the scenes ad the way of getting to the end.",1512000000,,1011,4.265625

8701987,1,B00TJ57T7O,I can't say this is a bad movie because that would imply it made enough sense to BE bad. The first 98% of the movie was a total loss because I literally could not understand a word they mumbled. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie where the background obscured the dialogue as bad as this one. When the end of the movie came they finally explained what was going on but then I realized they apparently didn't do anything during the movie that actually accomplished the goal as explained. Steer away from this one.,1455926400,,526,4.377551020408164
8701988,1,B00TJ57T7O,Poor sound...didn't understand much of anything they said. The closed caption function didn't work!!!,1446595200,,101,6.285714285714286
8701989,2,B00TJ57T7O,Okay movie,1445558400,,10,4.5
8701990,2,B00TJ57T7O,"Decently done, good story and decent CGI effects.  Acting was better than you would expect from a B grade Sci Fi flick.  The only issue I had with it was the sound is effing horrible.  I have a great sound system hooked up to my video system and the sound quality of this film is just crap. Half the time you cannot hear the dialog.  I tried to set the closed captioning on so I could at least follow the bits of conversation and keep up with the story... no such luck, the CC does not track in sync with the time frame of the movie. (I was watching the movie and the captioning was running 4 plus minutes behind the current story).  Tried restarting the film.... same problem.  Maybe it would work better on DVD... the digital version not so much.",1444435200,,748,4.232394366197183
8701991,1,B00TJ57T7O,Stupid. Not at all what I thought. Wish I could get my money back.,1444176000,,66,3.7857142857142856
8701992,1,B00TJ57T7O,Awful,1443139200,,5,5.0
8701993,3,B00TJ57T7O,"Johnson's story has a familiar trope that builds on a world where humanity is nearing a total genocide at the hands of a superior race. A race that in actuality is an evolution kickstarted by the events triggered by a time travel whose intentions are to make sure the resistance is allowed to be kickstarted. All part of that time travel continuum thingy that can give lay persons such as myself a headache thinking about it.

""Doomsday"" doesn't quite reach the level of awesomeness that other British sci-fi films reach. The characters and plot fall on the lower side of writing-as far as substance and character building. The dialog at times doesn't quite feel natural to the events taking place, the moments often do not seem as how a human in this profound situation would really act. The events and subject matter are slightly ""been there, done that"" in sci-fi/time travel films. However the last third of the film does seem to capture heart, emotion, and real substance with tying all the people and events together.

The special effects used in ""Doomsday"" fall in between 'Dr. Who' and 'Metal Hurlant' . They are on the cheaper side but the blend into the natural background of the film actually works to the advantage of Neil Johnson's movie, the CGI contrast gives the scenes and actions some character and entertainment value. Maybe not for all sci-fi, or more importantly British sci-fi fans, but I liked it. The special effects are stripped down more and the action is on a milder scale than some of the bigger budgeted films, but the settings, and design of it all is pretty cool and creative enough. Overall ""Doomsday"" is a pretty decent sci-fi story, true it gets caught up in the quagmires of familiarity and played out theories, but what hasn't in cinema these days. Check it out but just know that ""Doomsday"" is not some overstuffed, popcorn action thriller flick.",1442448000,2,1882,4.787692307692308
