8757248,4,B01DY3FQ1W,"I ordered this straight from Hong Kong and am glad I took a chance on it. A descent into the supernatural, but thankfully with an absolute absence of vampires, lycanthropes, and zombies, Keeper of Darkness instead presents spirits of many stripes and creeds, including vengeful souls and a brutish demon from the underworld named Hark. None of the ghosts in Keeper of Darkness look like Patrick Swayze, but that's just fine. Writer/ Director /Actor Nick Cheung makes this work.

The protagonist is Fatt (Nick Cheung), a likable man with a [figurative] third eye who has deep connections within the unseen world and who is a casual superhero of sorts in that he tries to reduce the havoc generated by the restless dead. While suffering mildly from an overly ambitious plot, Keeper of Darkness is nonetheless worth commending if you believe merits of creativity / novel ideas should be considered above all else in what makes a movie worth watching. A hit in Hong Kong toward the end of last year, cultural differences and subtitles will cause Keeper of Darkness to languish in the States. Although the disc jacket's artwork suggests horror fans should try applying themselves to the movie, an absence of gore and a creepy rather than scary vibe is not likely to win them over.

The nearly constant special effects in Keeper of Darkness are intriguing and offbeat, but not overly impressive for audiences raised on a steady diet of big budget Hollywood productions with astounding CGI. I found the visuals to be lavish, but my brain sometimes couldn't clarify if the effects were ethereal or if they were muddled. Regardless, a nice attempt at doing Kowloon Walled City is offered. The editing leaves something to be desired, and when combined with the need to read subtitles it's easy for Western eyes to become puzzled about precisely what is occurring. The inclusion of a love story (albeit with a ghost) will not win everyone over. Despite what many viewers may evaluate as shortcomings, you don't see something like Keeper of Darkness often (or at least not done this well), so give it a try if you are on the fence.
