It's also amazing to me how much his poems even then show how much he knows about the Torah.  The Raven and The Dove is recited to a full house listening intently to his words and voice.  Leonard Cohen transends description.",1242777600,3,391,4.514285714285714

1238781,5,B00000JS6R,"I really enjoyed this intimate insite into the early years of Leonard Cohen's life.  He allows an opportunity to see the world as he sees it, and allows the viewer an opportunity to see how he shapes those observations into poetry.  I was unexpectedly surprised at all sorts of things in this dvd, and was so disappointed when it ended.  Long live Leonard Cohen, he is a gift to us all.  A great watch.",1173312000,14,402,4.391891891891892

1238784,5,B00000JS6R,"When the new movie on Mr. Cohen came out in June ""I'm Your Man"" I wanted to see this CBC Documentary.  It is a fantastic look at Leonard when he was an up and coming poet.  You will never again get a look at the man as a contemporary in the mid 1960's.  Paired with the new movie at the end of his career in the 21st century you will have an amazingly true biography.

The Alpha and the Omega as it were.",1155513600,13,404,3.8313253012048194
1238785,5,B00000JS6R,"Brilliant Don Owen film from the NFBC. This is a proper documentary explaining the reality of Cohen. I interpret the footage as unflinching, as the always reliable NFBC lens discovers a sensitive, transitional and often uncomfortable artist. As I saw the film I witnessed Cohen in often hilarious social settings and conversations. There is a humor to the voice-over, but not an aesthetic one, as one of the previous reviewers indicated, puzzlingly. On a related note, the voice-over is spare, as the film relies on SOT and B-roll to describe its subject.
Included on the VHS copy of this film, as I saw it, were the remainder of Cohen related NFBC materials; some cartoons and other shorts in the 2-7 minute range.",1080518400,19,715,4.868852459016393
1238786,5,B00000JS6R,"""Ladies and Gentlemen...Mr. Leonard Cohen"" is a documentary made in 1965 about Leonard Cohen, before he was a singer-songwriter(although the film shows a brief scene of him playing guitar) but a writer. The film follows Leonard Cohen around Montreal, Canada(where he is on vacation from his home in Greece) as he goes about his daily life. The film also shows interviews with Cohen and has readings of his poetry in the background. Leonard Cohen is a man of many incarnations and this is simply one of them. The biggest surprise for me was seeing Leonard Cohen do standup comedy. While I don't believe Leonard Cohen is as depressing as most have made him out to be, I definitely would have never expect to see him do comedy. This documentary reminded me of Bob Dylan's ""Don't Look Back,"" an intimate look at an artist at a very young age. I recommend this documentary to anyone who is a fan of Leonard Cohen.",1076025600,30,908,4.645962732919255
1238787,5,B00000JS6R,"I just rented this fabulous DVD about Canadian novelist/poet/singer/traveller Leonard Cohen and am so glad I did... it is a little gem of a movie, giving us a first-hand look into the young Cohen as he, in his quiet, attractive way, lives and learns and laughs about life, in whatever order the day seems to bring him.
Filmed in Black & White and released in 1965, the film was made as a 'documentary,' and as such takes us 'behind-the-scenes' into a slightly-staged version of Cohen's day-to-day life, complete with scenes of him waking up, bathing, shaving, hanging out at the local bar or a friend's house with his closest friends, at a book signing, and walking in the Montreal park where he played as a child. The film was shot before he became famous as a singer, and as such it focuses mainly on his work/career as a poet and novelist.
The film was made by the Canadian National Film Board, and as such has a dated, now-quite-funny voice-over about Cohen. At the same time, the people behind the film definetely ""got"" Cohen -- the film is made with the same type of quiet humour that Cohen himself possesses. I think one of my favorite moments in the film shows Cohen being interviewed by a stern, older man who insists that Cohen couldn't possibly be a poet without things that ""bother"" or upset him. The man kind of insinuated that Cohen must have a mission of some sort, something deep -- that by being a poet, he must have been trying to address some wrong in the world and do something which would help correct it. But Cohen would have none of that. Looking like he does for much of the film: quiet, a bit smug, self-consciously attractive and intelligent, Cohen quietly responds, in a soft-spoken manner similar to that of B&W footage I've seen of fellow '60's poet Jim Morrison, ""well, what I'm really interested in is a state of grace. When I wake up in the morning, I have to know that things are in balance...."" The interviewer gives up completely then, and instead of getting any more miffed or confused, finally says, ""okay, now you've lost me."" And then you know it's Score One, Cohen and Film; Score Zero, Stuffy Clueless Interviewer.
I Highly Recommended this film to fans of Cohen's music, his writing, or others of the wanna-be beatnik variety. There are plenty of black turtlenecks, steaming cups of coffee, intently gazing eyes, sly comic humour, stern black glasses, and seductively charming lines. His deadpan sarcasm and semi-stand-up comedy routines work just as well in 2001 as they did in 1964. His dashing, quiet, tongue-in-cheek humour reminds me much of a reading I saw recently of fellow Canadian writer, Margaret Atwood. They both had me laughing in the aisles. But it was smart laughter, if that makes sense.
Better than a trip to the local coffehouse for that poetry slam -- well, just as good, but this one gives you a glimpse of history. I found it captivating. Forty years later, the Man still has It.",985305600,77,2943,4.661538461538462
1238788,4,B00000JS6R,"This DVD (and presumably the VHS version too) is composed of 2 parts: a 1960's era Canadian Film Board ""documentary"" about Cohen, and 4 short experimental music-video-like segments.
Fans who know Leonard Cohen  only through his music can expect either to be disappointed (because the  film largely predates and ignores this aspect of his life), or excited to  learn that Cohen is very much a world-class poet first and a musician  second.
The texture of the documentary is quaint, even funny to those of  us who grew up with MTV. It follows Cohen though his daily life, as he  speaks to everyday people on the street and crowds of fans in auditoriums,  and feels strangely like a propaganda film at times.
The ""selected  discography"" on the DVD is suprisingly useless and doesn't bother to  list most of his albums.
All in all, an interesting look at Cohen in his  spry younger years. Recommended.",944697600,52,897,4.803921568627451

Because I only recently ""discovered"" Leonard Cohen and know him by his more his mature work, it was plainly fun to see the earlier version.  The exterior is changed, not necessarily for the worse, but the charm and wit are much the same, although improved with time.

7913612,5,B00000JS6R,"Over the years, living in the US and Canada, I knew the name of Leonard Cohen; I knew he was a brilliant man with a somewhat off-beat reputation.  Luckily, I became acquainted with the Johnny Cash Music Festival 2011 which features Cohen song ""Hallelujah"" (wonderfully sung by Gary Morris and his son).  I guess I was the only person on the planet, who had never heard this song.  I had to print out lyrics because it was so beautiful; I was a proud Canadian again because of Leonard Cohen.  What a mind to compose such a brilliant poem (or whatever you want to call it).  I haven't watched this DVD as yet, I have to confess, but I will educate myself one way or another I'm sure.",1388448000,,681,4.330708661417323

7913614,5,B00000JS6R,"This is an excellent portrayal of Cohen as a poet.  I've watched it again and again because it's inspiring to see him at work as a writer.  You gain insights into his work ethic and dedication.  You see him as a detached, thoughtful, playful and profound artist living, writing and performing.  Especially helpful for any artist looking for justification to organize, work extremely hard and sacrifice for the craft.",1317945600,2,416,4.9855072463768115
7913615,4,B00000JS6R,"...to an exceptional artist. If you're new to Leonard Cohen or familiar with only his music, then this documentary is a great way to see him in his youth, as a rising star poet. True, it feels dated, as well it should. If you can get past its rather stiff 60s style of production, you'll get a glimpse of a brilliant young man reflecting on his life to that point. This documentary caused me to revisit Cohen's poetry, which has proven to be a true gift. Recommended!",1268092800,2,467,4.379310344827586
