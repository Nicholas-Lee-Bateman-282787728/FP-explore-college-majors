320465,4,6301229495,"This brilliant comedy plays as a warm-up for the masterful 'Forrest Gump'.  On a surface level it rejoices in the energy of youth, the thrill of Beatlemania, the eruption in the 1960s of sexual and personal liberation.  The historic Ed Sullivan appearance seems to mark the end of the conformist 1950s and the hedonistic, liberal 1960s.  This bridge is crossed by the film's heroine Pam, rejecting the oppressive life mapped out for her.
Behind the fun, however, is an acknowledgement that the 1960s was a myth.  There are ominous hints about Vietnam.  The publicity use by the Beatles manager of Pam's transgression is uncomfortably cross-cut with a prostitution scene, where another old man exploits a girl Pam's age.  The Beatles music actually replaces one conformity with another - if you are not in thrall to their spell, you are on your own, and God's looking.  Crucially, the centre of the film and period, The Beatles, is its most glaring, fetishised and fragmented absence.",985910400,2,983,4.993865030674846
320466,5,6301229495,This is definately a movie to remember. I saw it on TV and had to have it. It's a comedic way of looking at what teens took so seriously in those  days. But for any of you who are or have children that are 'Nsync or  Backstreet Boy fans know how to relate. What's even more hilarious is that  people really went through all that- AND STILL DO!

320514,5,6301229495,"Beatlemania  as it really was. Maybe that's why it's so funny because things like this were really happening. Not mentioned in these credits is the real star of this movie, the late great Wendie Jo Sperber. My God she was wonderful.
This is a funny movie and I just bought it on DVD to replace my old VHS version.

If you weren't alive in 1964 you might not understand this but the day after the Beatles were on The Ed Sullivan show,  school was chaos, everyone had pictures, posters and albums and the whole junior high was a-buzz......",1486771200,,537,4.459183673469388

320521,5,6301229495,"What a gem!  I was a 12 year old girl in 1964, and I was a Beatlemaniac from the beginning.  This movie PERFECTLY captures ever nuance - the hysteria, the joy, the insanity and the underlying lust, that we, as 12 yr old girls, didn't even know about  - yet.  This movies makes me sile and laugh and just a little bit sad - both because I wasn't either of the girls, and also because I wish I could relive that 12 yr old joy all over again.",1465257600,,439,3.9545454545454546

320533,4,6301229495,"Fun movie that bears repeated viewings. Excellent cast of young actors. Wendy Jo Sperber almost steals the show as the Paul loving, hysterical Beatles fangirl and Bobbi Di Cicco is also great as the Four Seasons fan and Beatle hater whose world is getting turned upside down. Eddie Deezen is also good as the self proclaimed ""greatest Beatles genius in the history of the universe.""  It's fast paced with lots of slapstick, gags and a white knuckle race in a limo through the streets of New York to get to the Ed Sullivan theater.  The story is about a group of friends from Maplewood NJ who take a road trip into the city to try to see The Beatles on their first visit to the US. Each has their own reason for going along. One of the girls is a folkie who wants to protest The Beatles until she witnesses a confrontation between police and a group of Beatles fans (involving a young boy with long hair) that clues her in to the revolutionary potential in The Beatles and their effect on the young.  That long haired boy is the subject of one the best scenes in the movie.  The boy's father has taken his tickets to the Ed Sullivan Show and won't give them back until he gets his hair cut.  They meet at a barber shop run by a barber with a patch over one eye.  Won't spoil the scene for you, but it brought back memories of my dad taking me to get haircuts. I always thought the barbershop was a scary place.  Another girl is an aspiring photographer and will do literally anything to get photos of the band.  All in all, it is a fast moving and light hearted take on Beatlemania and the lengths kids will go to to get close to their idols.  Soundtrack is all Beatles. If you liked ""A Hard Day's Night"" and the Maysles ""The Beatle's First US Visit"" you'll probably like this nostalgic take on Beatlemania.",1457395200,2,1806,4.335311572700297

320623,1,6301229495,"I love the idea behind this movie, but that was all I loved.  I bought this movie for nostalgic reasons, remembering these days vividly, and what the Beatles meant to me.  As a first generation Beatles fan, I thought this movie would help me explain Beatlemania to my kids and grand kids, but instead, I was actually embarrassed that I bought this DVD.  Where to start?  Well, the acting was atrocious.  I can only believe they were directed to be that way.  It was not funny.  What was supposed to be extreme fan excitement came across as kinetic high energy that quickly became tiresome to watch.  It was almost a Grease inspired shout out to A Hard Days Night with no artistic connection to either.  The excitement of the Beatles themselves, and the chance to see, or meet them in person would have been the equivalent of meeting perhaps Justin Bieber!  Just kidding.  There was nothing equivalent to that.  The endeavors, schemes, and lengths that fans would and did go through to see them would have been enteresting enough.  To explain and capture the reason for all this, the Beatles themselves, is still being examined and argued about to this very day.  When asked what I loved about them: I say, everything.  What did I like about this movie: nothing.  You could buy this and see for yourself, or you could better spend your money on Nowhere Boy, or Back Beat and enjoy them for what they are.  Although, its difficult to truly capture every little detail exactly of a persons life, these two tried and I believe them to be entertaining at least.  Good luck!",1360713600,,1568,4.619565217391305

320636,5,6301229495,"This movie is both a loving tribute and parody of Beatlemania, set around the Fab Four's very first appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, February 9, 1964.  Four New Jersey teenage girls talk a funeral home owner's son, Larry Dubois (Mark McClure), into driving them to New York to see the Liverpool lads on the Ed Sullivan show in his dad's limo and the hilarity ensues.  Rosie (Wendy Jo Sperber) is madly in love with Paul McCartney, Grace (Theresa Saldana) wants to snap photos of the band to kickstart her career as a photo journalist, Pam (Nancy Allen) is a night away from eloping with her boyfriend Eddie and is talked into going along, and Janis (Susan Kendall Newman) wants to protest the Beatles' popularity.  Dubois will do anything Grace asks because he has a crush on her.  Danny Smirko (Bobby DiCicco) tags along because he hates the Beatles and is hot for Janis.

Amidst all the mayhem, there are laugh-out-loud moments satirizing Beatlemania at its finest, not to mention that the movie is chock full of great early classics by the starring band we never actually see.  The two standout performers in this movie are Paul Newman's daughter as the folkie protest music loving Janis who later changes her mind about the Beatles' integrity, and Bobby Di Cicco whose character Danny Smirko is just plain obnoxiously hilarious.  If you haven't seen this one yet, you're in for a real treat.  There are a lot of underrated movies that were box office flops deserving the level of hit status, and this is truly one of them.  The writing is sharp, the cast is nearly perfect, and the story is a laugh a minute.  It's one of my favorite rock movies of all time, and I guarantee you will be thoroughly entertained.  Enjoy!",1334880000,6,1725,4.678807947019868
320637,5,6301229495,"This movie is the only mainstream (non-documentary) film I've ever seen about Beatlemania, that joyous phenomenon that took over the hearts of teenagers everywhere in the early '60's, and the way it evokes that time is simply perfect. The yearning of these 4 New Jersey girls to meet the Beatles when they're in New York to do the Ed Sullivan Show -- each for a different reason -- and what happens to them when they do, could not be more fun or make the audience happier. All the actors are simply wonderful (the Beatles are seen only as off-screen presences and voices, which works very well), and since the entire soundtrack is Beatles music circa 1964, it's hard not to smile through the whole thing. (How can you hate a film that starts with ""PLEASE PLEASE ME"" and ends with ""SHE LOVES YOU""?)

One of the qualities good films should evoke in audiences is a sense of joy, and this film, more than many I've seen, does that abundantly. If you were alive in 1964 and can remember this short period of crazy abandon, this film will give you a reason to sigh as well as smile. If you can't remember ... well ... watch this film and believe.

A small trivia point: One of the most interesting things about this first Ed Sullivan broadcast -- and it's not mentioned in this movie -- is that a young singer from England appeared on the Sullivan show that night and later watched the Beatles from the wings, stunned at their impact on the audience. He never forgot it, and just a few years later, became lead singer - yes - for The Monkees (yes, it was Davy Jones), which was a group meant to follow in the Beatles' footsteps. Funny how one phenomenon can lead to another ...",1334448000,,1671,4.4397394136807815

320639,5,6301229495,This is an excellent movie. My favorite charator is the one who was going to get married and went to New York reluctantly where she ended up exploring her options. She ended up getting her fifteen minutes of fame after she ended up in the Beatles hotel room accidently and actually enjoying herself. A couple of the other charators were Beatles trivia buffs. One of those two was in the first season of Punky Brewster but is best known as the know it all on The Polar Express. Another charator just wanted to get pictures of the Beatles. She bribes the son of a funeral director and owns lots of limos to drive them to New York and the Beatles hotel. Naturally this guy has a crush on her which is why he agrees to it. Then naturally you have the two charators who hate the Beatles to point of boycotting them although one comes around. Then theres  a kid whos father is forcing him to get a haircut because his hair is as long as the Beatles. And of course we have a cameo by Murray the K and Ed Sullivan. Each of the kids are trying to get tickets at least to some extent to see the Beatles on their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan show and  each end up getting tickets to see Beatles first appearence on the Ed Sullivan show that night.

The guys who played the actual 'Beatles' themselves were only shown in silhouette and such and the voices given for them were bad and cliche. The characters in the movie I found to be unlikable and strange just as strange as their expressions are on the cover of the movie.

Over the years I've become a fan (even been to Liverpool) and like many, have read enough to know the history of their 1964 ""invasion."" I recently came across this movie and was curious to see how the Sullivan event would be portrayed. To me, the production value was very good. The actor playing Ed Sullivan was great, the voices of the Fab Four were a little over the top, but done in such a way that you knew exactly who was suppose to be speaking, and I was really impressed the way original footage and Beatles' music was incorporated into the movie. The movie was rated PG for a lot of unnecessary cussing. The language added nothing to the movie. I don't know why Hollywood is so afraid to make a G rated movie, but I digress...Anyway, a good movie for younger fans to see all the mayhem that followed the Beatles.

I don't mind some swearing, but this movie had way too much.  Not for children.

There were scenes that I loved, like when the Nancy Allen character got into the Beatles' hotel room, and her Paul obsessed friend who was trying to get a ticket to Ed Sullivan.

A bunch of teens from New Jersey goes to New York to score tickets to see the Beatles live at the Ed Sullivan Show but to succeed such an impossible task, these talented and funny people goes through comical hell getting there.

My young kids, (All Beatles fans), enjoyed it.  My wife and I howled with laughter many times thoughout.

My kids though pointed out some technical flaws such as John Lennon's Rickenbacker wasn't the correct model and Paul's Hofner bass in the movie was for a right-hander. Well, it was a good effort.

This film was originally released in 1978, but I never heard of it until recently.  It was produced by Steven Spielberg and some of the same young talent was used in Spielberg's later film, ""1941"", But ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" was far better than that.

320661,4,6301229495,"This is a very fast-paced and humorous movie about a group of friends going to NYC to see the Beatles 1'st appearance on the Ed Sullivan show.  Two scenes very early on had me hooked on the movie: the record shop scene(which introduces the main characters), and the car ride scene.  Both scenes really did a great job of getting you into these characters, their situation,  and their varying reasons for making this trip.  The movie does a great job of presenting us with their misadventures, and ties it up neatly and satisfyingly at the end for all the characters involved i think.

The film is filled with energetic performances and some very good, witty dialogue.  And no offense to Eddie Deezen fans or the other actors, but i think Wendie Jo Sperber(as Rosie) steals the movie by a long-shot.  Her performance is infectious.  But everyone did a great job and were perfect for their roles.  For example, Bobby Di Cicco's character-type i naturally find annoying, but he does such a charismatic turn with it that he ends up taking second behind Wendie as far as stealing the movie for me.  Anyway, I won't say you have to be a Beatles fan to enjoy this(i am), but it will definitely help with all the authentic Beatles music provided, including the actual performance at the end.

As for the dvd: it's in dolby digital 5.1, english/french/espanol subtitles, anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1, and only has two extras(albeit both are pretty good).  There is a b&w photo gallery of the production and an interesting audio commentary with writer Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis.  The most disappointing fact i learned from this was that the movie bombed big-time when it was released in '78.  Well, hopefully this movie gets a second life on dvd.

320697,5,6301229495,"...the Beatles hit the US Shores!

I love this movie.  It is pure fun and a delightful fan fiction about how several resourceful kids from Maplewood, N.J. manage to see the Beatles two days after they arrived in America, the day of their first appearance on Ed Sullivan which was February 9, 1964!

This is an excellent, brilliantly executed masterpiece.  The kids borrow a limousine and are somehow able to sneak past the police barricade at the hotel where the Beatles are staying.  Once they get the car parked, they split up and embark on ways to meet their idols.  Susan Newman, daughter of Paul Newman does an exemplary job of playing a Beatle-buster until she meets a charming 11-year-old boy with a Beatle haircut who provides her with a change of heart.

The kids' madcap methods to secure passes to see their idols on Ed Sullivan on February 9, 1964 range from posing as a prostitute to winning the tickets on a radio quiz show.  Beatle fans will laugh at how ludicrously easy the questions are (""who's the youngest Beatle?  GEORGE!  Which Beatle is left handed?  PAUL!"")

One lucky young girl, who is engaged to be married somehow sneaks into the Beatles' suite and hides under a bed.  Prior to hiding, she steals cutlery and other hotel room objects the boys have touched.  Seeing her erotic rapture upon securing these items is almost humorous.

The Beatles themselves appear in ""ghost"" or shadow form.  Images and pictures of them on album covers can be found; the man who plays Susan Newman's father owns a record store and he sports a Beatle wig and plays Beatle records to drum up business.  In the hotel suite scene, the ""Beatles"" enter the room, but you never see them from the knees up.  Convincing accents and light banter is exchanged; the fan hiding under the bed faints in an erotic swoon when George steps out of his ""trousers"" so he can have them pressed and cleaned.

The characters are fun, believable and provide some Beatle history for the Beatle-blighted era otherwise known as the Late Nineteen Seventies, when it took all but an Act of Congress (or like the Paul McCartney song of that era, ""With A Little Luck"") even to see a Beatle on television, let alone be treated to a Beatle themed movie!  The Ed Sullivan sequence was seemlessly and flawlessly done.  The actor who played Ed Sullivan was quite believable and so was the set, which looked like the now famous Beatle venue.

A must have for Beatle fans and their counterparts alike.  The ending is hilarious and will leave you singing Beatle songs for a long time to come!  Get ready to do some singing, dancing and having some fun!",1114732800,9,2621,4.647826086956521

Some may read this and think that I'm being too generous with this reveiw and maybe I am. Granted I Wanna Hold Your Hand isn't The Godfather or anything like that.

320699,4,6301229495,"Robert Zemeckis' I Wanna Hold Your Hand captures the time that was Beatlemania, February 1964.  Who better to capture a time than Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg as executive producer helping out to bring out the authenticity to the period?  The film was made 14 years after the event, and at the same time, when all the flurry of an immanent Beatles reunion was circulating around and Beatlemania was hitting Broadway. This film was a reflection of the baby boomers possibly turning 30 and their commemoration or celebration of their wild and crazy times where they lived for hysteria, that is, before the drug-hallucinations and San Francisco's Haight Ashbury would converge on the happy-go-lucky Hullabaloo and Shindig era, or in this case, Sunday night with Ed Sullivan and his circus of stars.

Nonetheless, I Wanna Hold Your Hand is not about the period of innocence, but rather the hype and the mass distribution of Beatles paraphenalia that occurred during the time - Beatles bedsheets, sneakers, or baby powder.  The film had several hilarious moments as captured by the six New Jersey teenagers who hitch a ride to New York with one teenager taking his father's hearst as his only means of transportation in order to catch a glimpse of their Liverpudlian idols.  For the female character played by Nancy Allen, she was the fortunate one - she was able to get into the four lads' hotel room. Unfortunately, it eventually put her in hot water as well with her fianc where she broke off the engagement, but received two tickets to the Sullivan show.  Though this is the purely a fantasy, the teenagers succeed at the end of the film.

The movie is definitely a recreation of the period with the early Beatle tunes blaring during the opening credits of the film, the screaming girls, and the general atmosphere with the cars and the clothes as well as the typical parent frowning down on these ""long-haired"" boys from England.  I Wanna Hold Your Hand could have been any teenager's story, but with the magic of movies, these five teenagers had their dreams come true for one day and one night.",1111968000,14,2097,4.821727019498607

I watched this film with two friends: one who loves the Beatles, one who can't stand the Beatles, and all three of us had a complete *blast*.

Why? Because it's a riotous two of hours of zany, crazy, hillarious fun.  The chemistry between the kids in the film is fantastic, and it covers all angles of the events of that insane February in 1964: from the over the edge obsessed 'Rosie' to the death-to-the-beatles 'Smirko'. The film even spends time focusing on the issue of kids vs. parents in putting in a sub plot about an enraged father stopping at nothing to get his son to cut his hair like a 'marine' and not a 'girl.'

And *that* is why the film is a gem, because in two hours it beautifully capsules an entire chapter in western pop culture when everything seemed to be turned completely on its head.  Even if you can't stand the beatles you will surely have a great time with the movie if for no other reason that it's a terrific and surprisingly well made romp back in time!

That help came in the form of four moptop lads, called the Beatles, hailing from Liverpool, England! They started a musical/cultural/youth revolution, when they arrived in America and gave a historic, widely seen, live performance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"". This is the backdrop of Bob Zemeckis' nostalgic, hilarious, slapstick comedy ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"". The film chronicles the adventures of six New Jersey. teenagers, who travel to NYC hoping to either meet their 'Fab Four' heroes or at least get into the show. The group includes Grace (Theresa Seldano) an aspiring photographer who wants to get exclusive Beatle photographs, Rosie (Wedy Jo Sperber), who believes Paul McCartney is her future ""soul mate"", Janis (Susan Kendall) a beatnik/folkie, who sees the Beatles as a form of youth rebellion, and finally, Pam (Nancy Allen), who's on a last fling before getting married. The girls, along with two guys, split up and go on various wacky adventures trying to penetrate the Beatles' fortress-like, NYC, luxury hotel and eventually meet up at the "" Really Bigggg Shewwww!!!"" Director/Writer Bob Zemeckis (along with co-writer, Bob Gale) has done a wonderful job of recreating the electricity and manic atmosphere, that surrounded the Beatles' first visit to America. What's more he does this without ever really showing us the Beatles! Instead the smart and funny script focuses on the kids and the mania they are enveloped in. The pacing of the story is fast and furious. Much of the comedy is highlighted with slapstick stunts (suit cases go flying, cars crash and even gumball machines get broken), which evolve from the various plans to get close to John, Paul, George and Ringo. The cast does a fine job with their roles. Actress, Wendy Jo Sperber is hilarious as the portly teenie bopper, who is forever throwing a fist full of dimes at various telephone booths trying to win concert tickets from radio contests. I also liked comic actor, Eddy Deezen  who plays a nutty, Jerry Lewis-like, Beatlemaniac, who helps the girls out. Mention should also be made of the wonderful costumes and sets, which give an air of authenticity to recreating the era. This is also helped by the film's great soundtrack, which is wall to wall, original Beatles' music. Extras include an excellent commentary track by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale, which really highlights the technical aspects of making the film.

320717,4,6301229495,"In 1978 there were two films that touched on the Beatles and Beatlemania that Beatlemaniacs were awaiting,""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"".  The way films were distributed back then was different then the way they release them today.  Despite good reviews from some critics, ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" played poorly in limited release in a few select cities and subsequently was shelved by the studio.  Unfortunately, for anybody who has seen it, ""Sgt. Pepper"" didn't suffer the same fate.  Back then in the pre-VCR days you had to wait until it came to commercial television (no cable either).  I did not see this film until a few years later.  If I recall correctly it came on after ""Saturday Night Live"".  I enjoyed this film immensely.  I have now revisited this film on DVD and while I still enjoy the film it is not as great as I remember it.  Now granted, Beatlemania was a mania so we can allow for the manic, slapsticky tone of most of the film.  However, Director Robert Zemeckis and co-screenwriter Bob Gale seem to be employing to a degree some of the over-the-top comedy that didn't work in their subsequent collaboration with Steven Spielberg, ""1941"".  That said they seem to have alot of the elements right, good art direction and they were able to secure the rights to actual Beatle recordings.  They have an able young cast (except for that annoying Jerry Lewis wannabe, Eddie Deezen), particularly Nancy Allen.  Allen plays Pam, a soon to be married Beatles fan who stows away into the boys' hotel room.  Her seductive fondling of the boys personal effects(particularly Paul's bass) is classic stuff.  Kudos also have to go to Will Jordan's spot-on impersonation of Ed Sullivan and Murray the K just being himself.",1096848000,3,1766,4.801324503311259
320718,5,6301229495,"This unknown gem of a movie from director Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump; Back To The Future; Castaway; Roger Rabbit"" to name some) and Executive Produced by Steven Spielberg (now I know I don't have to supply THAT resume) is one of the best films ever made, and surprisingly, many moviegoers have not heard of, nor seen this film.  It truly transports you back to 1964, during the height of the Beatlemania craze, when Ed Sullivan first introduced the Beatles on TV to the USA.

I wasn't born until after that time, but I love Beatles music, and this movie creatively uses not only their actual songs, but shots from the real, initial Ed Sullivan broadcast to comprise the film. Their songs and shots wrap around one of the most clever script plotlines ever devised, of a group of teenagers trying to see the Beatles in-person themselves. You have to see it to understand it.

I laughed out loud, and although some of the humor in the movie is way over the top, it's all hysterical, and makes you wish that you could go back in time and become a Beatles fanatic in NYC during that era.  The cast is dead on...and it's a shame that many of the actors in this film never became household names. They're excellent and make the material believable.

If you're not a fan of the Beatles, or too young to understand this moment in history, it won't matter.  ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" is really an homage to anyone and everyone who has had a wild crush on a musical group, or rock star, and has had the ultimate fantasy of meeting that artist in person.

The zany shenanigans in this plot are ingenius. Ultimately, this movie proves why Robert Zemeckis went on to such a major career.  A MUST SEE!

ABOUT THE DVD:  Great commentary, although filled with some pauses - the picture quality is decent despite the fact that this does not look like an impeccable transfer. (there is some grain that is inherent from probably the original film stock - (hey, it's from the 1970's)  It's enhanced for 16 x 9 TV sets, so it looked good on my widescreen HDTV. The DVD also includes some black and white production pics.

Oh God, it just cracked me up completely. Especially Rosie, the chubby Paul-insane groupie. Every time when she heard (on the radio) that they were announcing to win free tickets, she would drop whatever she was doing and dash to the nearest phone (""I know the answer!!"") to try to win.
Basically what the story is about is: a group of young people go on a road trip to NYC to try to meet the Beatles who are performing live on Ed Sullivan. They plot to sneak into the hotel the Beatles are actually staying at! Now who hasn't thought or hoped vaguely of doing this (for any favourite band) at one point?
They made the movie feel pretty real. They had actors playing Ed and the Fab Four themselves (not showing their faces though, obviously).
