""Baby Einstein"" style presentation.  Pleasant (but not perfect) classical piano background music.",1307059200,,204,5.580645161290323
8125209,1,B000FP2PCG,I think this just compares very badly to the They might be giants DVDs for children. Good basic words being introduced but very slow.,1221177600,,133,4.583333333333333
8125210,3,B000FP2PCG,"This video, though a novel idea, is not great. The video could have had more vocabulary and the accent is Calucutta Bengali, not Bangladesh Bengali--an analogy would be a student learning British English instead of American English.",1189296000,4,232,5.297297297297297
8125211,5,B000FP2PCG,"some friends of mine are Indian and American and this is a wonderful present for the rice-ceremony!

They love it!",1180051200,2,114,4.7
