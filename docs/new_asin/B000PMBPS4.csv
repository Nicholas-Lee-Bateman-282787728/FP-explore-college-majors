8192402,1,B000PMBPS4,"While this DVD course has much interesting material, the presentation given by the instructor is unsatisfactory.  The instructor simply reads from his notes.  There are very very few graphics supporting this (even simple power point slides are missing for the most part).  The camera wobbles back and forth as it tries to follow the instructor rocking back and forth.  This would be an excellent resource if the production company would simply use the narration given by the instructor and replace the video portion with supported graphics to support the topic and details.  As it is right now, the DVDs are very difficult and boring to watch.",1327363200,3,643,5.028301886792453
8192403,5,B000PMBPS4,"This DVD series is by the Teaching Company, which reliably produces good quality educational materials on a wide range of subjects. All of the courses are taught by university/college professors. Some, like this biology course, are geared toward high school students who are being home-schooled or who just need to have additional means of reviewing class material. Others are for adult learners who are simply interested in a subject or, like me, are preparing to take college classes in a field they aren't familiar with. In my case, I haven't had a biology class since the late 1980s. I now need to brush up on biology in preparation for anatomy & physiology classes I'll be taking as part of a pre-nursing program.

I've found the biology class to be very engaging. The professor, Stephen Nowicki, is an interesting speaker. He has organized the material by topic, beginning at the microscopic level with DNA and cell structure, and working outward to organisms and ecosystems and then to larger concepts such as how evolution works. He also explains the material using a historic context - he describes how a concept, like genes, was first theorized or discovered by earlier scientists, the research breakthroughs that followed as scientists worked to prove or disprove a theory, and finishes with the current understanding of the concept. This approach helps to illustrate one of the course's main theses, which is that science is not static, and what may be widely accepted as fact today may not be tomorrow, or five or fifty years from now.",1279843200,2,1548,4.976833976833976
8192404,5,B000PMBPS4,"I got these videos to review for the biology portion of a nursing entrance exam. I hadn't had biology in decades. The professor is engaging and very clear, and covers all the essential concepts of biology. I scored in the 97th percentile of my entrance test, and got a 100% on the biology portion.",1278633600,3,297,4.518518518518518
8192405,5,B000PMBPS4,"I got this DVD/book set in order to take the biology placement test at my university. Not only did I place out of introductory biology after watching the DVDs, but it was much more enjoyable than going to a large lecture class. The prefessor is engaging, the course guidebook is very helpful for following along. You don't even need a supplementary biology textbook!",1262476800,3,366,4.825396825396825
