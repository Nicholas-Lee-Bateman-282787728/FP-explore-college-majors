7366838,5,B013JBJ8T0,"I love the show.  It was a little too much in the sex department this season, not that I'm opposed.  It just seemed to take over the whole show.  But the acting, the characters, all of it are wonderful!!",1443139200,,203,4.153846153846154
7366839,2,B013JBJ8T0,"The first four seasons of Shameless were the most unexpectedly brilliant hours of television I've ever watched. Who knew that such an over-the-top and downright insane comedy could also have such heart and intelligence. Even after some questionable plotting decisions, I had faith in the writers to keep the quality going for at least a couple more seasons. Every show has an expiration date, but by the Season Four finale of Shameless, it seemed like the writers had a masterplan and that it could very well be the first Showtime series to stay great throughout its entire run.

Oh, how wrong I was.

Season Five is a dull, meandering mess that feels like a parody of its former self. The only plot-line that rang true was Kev and V's, but even that needed some serious trimming and did not merit a full season of build-up. But Fiona's story? Boring, predictable and counterproductive to her character development. Ian? Well, he's pretty much a new character now, but there's not much reason to care. Debbie? More teenage soap drama, rather than tapping into the character's loyalty and intelligence of past seasons. And don't even get me started on Lip...what a waste of Jeremy Allen White's talent.

But the biggest disappointment has to be Frank. Season Four, and its conclusion, would have you believe that Frank is going to change somehow. No, he'll never be a great parent or upstanding citizen, but some sort development was clearly order after he faced death and barely came out on top. But...no. They do NOTHING with Frank that we haven't already seen a better version of in prior seasons. More scamming, more antics. It's just so lazy.

Remember how crazy and energetic the first three seasons were? And then how tragic yet darkly comic Season Four was? Well, it seems like the writers couldn't make up their minds with Season Five. It's not as fun and awe-inspiring as the earlier episodes, and it's not as dramatically satisfying as Four. It's Shameless Lite, with an uncertain tone and a soap-opera structure.

What a shame.",1442534400,34,2038,4.861671469740634

7366852,5,B013JBJ8T0,"Like everyone else who watches, I love Shameless too!  At every turn, the series is full of laughs and fun. As a documentary, it conveys a true picture of life in the older sections of American cities, the day-to-day struggles of ordinary people.  The show deals with a lot of difficult problems we face in our society in an unedited, true-to-life,authentic format. The strong adult themes may be a bit too strong for young children to watch. We are all anxious to see the new surprises Season 8 has in store for us!

I am a Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy) lookalike, so my interest in this comedy series goes beyond being a vivid viewer. I'm hoping I can somehow contribute to preserving the continuing popularity of this incredible show by participating in its production first-hand.  Many thanks to all the bar patrons who have commented on my renditions of Frank's character.",1496275200,2,881,4.776315789473684

Frank is still scum,  Debbie still a typically clueless teenager, Carl going off the rails, Ian an unconvincing psychotic, Fiona kind of an unlikeable slut and Lip all over the place.

7367316,5,B013JBJ8T0,"I binge watched it and just finished the 4 seasons available.  I loved it.  Is 'disfunctional' a strong enough word for the Gallagher family?  Loved the kids, as their personalities developed, creating ways to deal with issues no kid should have to deal with at all.  They are all heroes in one way or another, all survivors.  Fiona and Lip, especially, although each of the others too.  Also loved the weird side stories, Sheila and her enormous dildos, then trying to adopt the Native American (ha!) kids, who selected her over their grandfather because she had WiFi, etc., etc.  Daughter Sammy and her weird fat kid, reveals another generation of 'trailer trash"" but somehow still have heart.  Frank, the alcoholic druggie is another thing altogether.  A spectacular role for Macy but so painfully unsaveable; played well, I dislike his as much as the kids do but see his pride, his 'beat to another drummer' philosophy.

It is a scary story, not far from the truth",1470787200,,968,4.8121212121212125

But I quickly became addicted to this show.  It brings out every emotion and even makes you laugh.  The first four seasons were available on Netflix but I couldn't stop there.  So I looked on Amazon and found both season 5 and 6.  I don't have cable TV so I feel the 8.99 per month for Showtime is a pretty good deal.  If there are no other shows I am interested in after I finish these episodes, I will cancel it.  I've also got two other friends hooked on this series now.",1469836800,,613,4.224137931034483

These people live in the big city of Chicago, IL living the total crazy unpredictable big city life!  There are twist and turns in every single episode, there is not one single boring moment.  There is a bit more nudity and cursing than I prefer, but it is also what makes them who they are.  If you like a show that you get addicted to the funny unbelievable characters in it, then you will love this one.  They have no Morales and basically do as they please and do whatever it takes to survive and feed their family.  The eldest sister raises all the kids, while the Dad is a complete alcoholic.  They find him passed out in all kinds of places that most human beings would never even go near.  Give it a try!  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.",1469491200,,870,4.218181818181818

Incredible cast capable of taking us to the highs and lows without letting us slip away. The daily struggles for the whole family are so fraught with pain mixed with laughter.

7367708,5,B013JBJ8T0,"Love it! So much of this series makes me laugh why tears are rolling down my cheeks &  my stomach hurts from laughing so hard. However there are some serious episodes that hit really close to home for me, so were I can completely relate to all the characters!!! Which is good & interesting in many ways because it stirs up mixed emotions that I've experienced in my life as well as my family has (btw whose all from the south side of Chicago).  The great thing about the show is it is pretty close to what living on the southside is like. It also shows what living in poverty is truly about, and how hard it is to get ahead in life, yet it still teaches us that no matter what, you make the best of every situation regardless of what hand you were dealt!  That's what makes this series so special & wonderful show because you're able to relate to every character in 1 way or another! One of the best comedic yet dramatic series I've seen in a long time!",1466208000,,953,4.19672131147541

I got a little annoyed with the constant gratuitous sex scenes with virtually every single character in Season 5, and I never want to see Frank's naked, skinny butt again in this lifetime.  The subject matter is always very adult and I could never imagine watching any of this series with my 18 year old.

7367909,5,B013JBJ8T0,"SPOILERS: Seasons 4 and 5 saw something pretty amazing begin and then, unfortunately, come to a grinding halt. The development of Noel Fisher's character Mickey Milkovich was dynamic, profound, and heart-rending. When you consider how little screen time Mickey had overall, it's even more astonishing. Still true to the Shameless brand, there are enough hilarious moments to keep this show teetering between comedy and tragedy, but few of the characters really grow in positive directions. Mickey was the exception (as was Sheilah). If you found Mickey's storyline as engrossing as I did, you too will want to replay the season 5 finale just to appreciate the subtle and potent non-verbal poetry of Fisher's performance (think: running down the sidewalk). Unfortunately (and this is the SPOILER), the arc of Mickey's development was really just cresting when the actor who played him opted out of the show. His scene in the Season 6 opener is gut wrenching. Really good stuff. Hard to see it come to an end.",1454976000,17,1007,5.072289156626506

Anyway instead of speaking with a lawyer she just shows up to visit ethan and talks to his commanding officers wanting them to release him. All she needed to do was bring his birth certificate along with his medical records. They should have never admitted him into the army without a picture id.
