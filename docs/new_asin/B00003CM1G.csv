I quickly got used to this workout after about a month or two, and needed a little bit more! So I took it outside. the best part about this video is that the exercises aer easy to remember, I was able to workout outside just as if I had the video with me.

The hardest move on this tape is probably the ""Dive-bombers,"" but the more you do the moves the easier they become. I also had a difficult time doing pull-ups, due to poor upper body strength. But I started doing more push-ups, and bench pressing to increase upper body strength, then I went out and bought a pull-up bar for my doorway in order to do pull-ups just for this exercise tape, and now I can *almost* keep up with the recruit on the video.

This was a great buy, it kept me in shape for about a year and a half! Now I gotta work this 30 min workout back into my daily routine to get back into shape!

Overall: Awesome purchase, great price!
