7166917,5,B00X99RNOU,"My son is a transformers fanatic, and this was a surprise for doing so well at potty training.  He loves this movie, as it contains his two favorite things (Transformers and Dinosaurs).  Would definitely purchase again...in fact I probably will purchase again soon because my son also doesn't understand that ""playing"" the the DVD's ruins them.  Wish me luck!

We noticed Rescue Bots on Netflix, and decided to give it a try; For Easter this year we decided that we would purchase all the rescue bots dvds so my son could watch them while he is visiting his grandparents. This show contains a lot of action to keep my son entertained during long trips.",1464134400,,351,4.415384615384616
