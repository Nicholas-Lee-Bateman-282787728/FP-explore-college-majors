8176831,4,B000NDEXJI,"Sadly the pressure networks place on shows to be instant successes can in some cases lead to early canceling of shows that have great potential.  Kitchen Confidential got treated poorly by the network being bounced around the schedule, pre-empted repeatedly and finally just canceled before it could begin to get an audience.  The series was a lot of fun and was slowly begining to develope into a winner but alas the powers at be just did not give it enought time.  The battle between rival chefs each trying to do in the other by upping the anty with pranks was priceless.  All in all this series was very good and improving it just needed more time and was well on its way to peeking in its 2nd season which it never got.  Some episodes were never aired and it is hoped they will be included on this release. In short this series had some very good talent at hand and good writing however again the lack of time did not allow a lot of the characters to get well developed but it was on its way.  This is a series worth having and enjoying viewing again and again.",1172707200,3,1066,4.358585858585859
