8229398,2,B000XSKDA6,"This documentary is mearly a cut and stitch of three Public domain short films with about as minimum amount of B-24 Liberator footage as it gets. If you are a modeler or a WWII aviation buff, you've probably seen these films before in some other form or format. My advice to you is give this one a pass.",1335830400,3,303,4.241379310344827
