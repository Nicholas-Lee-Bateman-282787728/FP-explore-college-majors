I am a pediatric nurse practitioner and know the resources that are out there - they are helpful,but lacking in the basics. They are all delivering the same message - ""eat healthy and exercise"". I find that we need to get down to these basic skills - how to shop and how to cook!  With the given problem of obesity in our nation as well as other countries, the associated problems and long term poor health outcomes are astounding. By far, Linda's two cookbooks and now four videos, are a must for any household and health arena.  Her passion, presentation, and practicality of everything from shopping to preparation of the most healthy way of living is so easy.  And to top it off, it is presented in a way that anyone on a budget(or not) can live a healthy life. We always read that it cost so much to eat healthy - she proves this theory is just hearsay. My prayers are with her and others as they continue to forge a healthier way of life. I would hope that organizations across the nation and the world will utilize her resources. If you would visit her website to get a bigger picture of her work and testimonials/endorsements, you will want her book/videos! Your families and your patients will benefit!",1387929600,2,1296,4.483050847457627

I have learned to use new for me, healthier items that are now a staple in my cooking.  These recipes make the organic way of eating cost less than the old Standard American Diet.  This is a great way to learn where to start.  Linda's practical step by step approach sprinkled with encouraging humor is the best I've seen.",1387065600,2,449,4.575
