8247967,5,B0012VO5JS,"First of Billy's DVD's I have watched. I have seen about 25 hunting videos over the years. For me, this was one of the best produced and most enjoyable I have watched. Billy's work with the camera and dialogue was very good - down to earth, helpful and ""real"". There are a lot of hunting videos out there, most are poorly done and badly edited. This one is a good one and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Alaska hunting or sheep hunting. Well done! Keep it up!",1487635200,,479,4.274725274725275
