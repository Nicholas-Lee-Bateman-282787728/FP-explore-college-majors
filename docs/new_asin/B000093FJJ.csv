1877158,5,B000093FJJ,I loved the reality of this story.  Most of us who belly dance can relate to being an average Jane during the day and a Belly Dancing goddess at night.  It has a few unexpected twists and hypnotic dance scenes at the casbah.  With real life situations and cultural taboo being a big part of the story it remained intriguing until the very end.,1171670400,2,343,4.328125
1877159,5,B000093FJJ,"Lilia is an attractive widow, apparently in her early 40s who lives an upstanding conservative lifestyle in a city of Tunisia. She is a seamstress who also does knitting on the side to keep herself occupied. Her husband has been gone for many years and her lack of companionship and boredom is evident. When cleaning her apartment, she plays Arabic music and dances sensuosly while watching herself in the mirror.  It is clear she is ripe for some adventure ...

She is raising a teenage daughter, Salma, who uses the excuse of studying with a girlfriend to secretly meet for a triste with her boyfriend, a nightclub musician with whom she is in love. During a phone call to her mother, Lilia hears music in the background played at a girl friend's birthday party. Lilia realizes the importance of protecting her daughter from unsavory influences within the conservative Arabic culture in which they live. She thinks her daughter may have gone with friends to the local cabaret. Lilia goes there to find her ....

Lilia is transfixed within this forbidden environment. She is fascinated watching the lead belly dancer perform for a mostly male clientele who are appreciative and moved to a passionate frenzy. Her conservative upbringing clashes with what she sees which seems to express her repressed desires ... She faints. Lilia awakens in the dressing room of the performers. She admires their sequined costumes and low cut flimsy silk flowing skirts styled in the harem fashion ... She is invited back for a visit and is treated like a guest. Later, Lilia receives dance lessions from the lead belly dancer and obtains a very beautiful belly dance outfit. She is encouraged to wear it and dance at the cabaret ... She keeps this aspect of her life secret from her daughter and neighbors. A neighbor lady friend admonishes Lilia to keep a closer watch on Salma who is returning home during late hours. Lilia agrees to do this and notes the teenager years are the most difficult ... An Uncle visits from the village. He tries to persuade Lilia to return there, to cut herself off from the modern influences of television where women are behaving immodeslty ... Tthe Uncle has not a clue about Lilia's secret hobby ...

Lilia awes the crowd of men at the cabaret and is especially attracted to the darbouk player named Choki ...The  manager of the cabaret wants Lilia to meet a customer with implications for possible improper behavior. Lilia is introduced to the man, who admires her dancing and invites her to his villa. At just the right moment, Choki comes to her rescue  excusing Lilia on the grounds that her husband, a karate expert would not approve. Lilia ends up going home with the darbouk player and engaging in a passionate affair. On screen, using only artistic close up shots, the act of making love is conveyed without being offensive. Within a few days Choki breaks off the affair without explanation.

Not long afterwards, Salma becomes engaged to her musician boyfriend whom she introduces to her mother for the first time. They plan to wed. Lilia provides no hint that she knows him. At their wedding, Lilia dances provacatively before the couple, clearly sending body signals to the groom. The viewer is left to ponder how the events of the past will affect the future happiness of this couple. Salma is totally in the dark about the brief affair between Lilia and Choki. Neither one of them knew how each was connected with Salma and her future happiness. This most astonishing film tackles a complex issue which essentially remains unresolved ... the future is uncertain. It is highly worth viewing.

1877160,5,B000093FJJ,"Lilia (Hiam Abbass) is a lonely bored widow living within the confines of the social order in Tunisia. She lives for her beautiful young daughter, Salma (Hend Al Fahem): coddling her, doing for her, worrying about her and basically smothering her. As most young girls everywhere do...Salma rebels and begins to date and bed a cabaret/belly dancing musician, Chokri (Maher Kahoun). Lilia finds out, follows Chokri to the cabaret and basically finds herself: she befriends a wild Tunisian belly dancer, learns to dance, cuts her hair, buys modern clothing and shoes and makes a life for herself.

Director Raja Amari's mise en scene is filled with movement, color and life very much in line with the Mira Nair's view of the world: it's basically a drag but when it gets you down...just P-A-R-T-Y!!! Many scenes in ""Satin Rouge"" (red satin) remind me very much of Nair's gorgeous ""Monsoon Wedding"" as both films deals with repressive societies in which dance and music serve as sexual and social palliatives particularly for the women.

""Red Satin"" is a well made, smart and knowing film. It tugs at your heart and nourishes your soul: what more can you ask?",1141171200,8,1155,4.917948717948718
1877161,5,B000093FJJ,"Note: Arabic with English subtitles.

This is a great women's empowerment film, but you don't have to be female to enjoy it. Lilia (Hiam Abbassa) is a widowed, middle-aged woman living the life a unexciting reclusive lifestyle as a seamstress. Her only child, a daughter, is a college student who has a life of her own and has only marginal contact with her Mother.

Her life appears to be going nowhere until she happens to meet a bellydancer while shopping at a local cloth store. She is hired by her new aquaintance a few days later comes to the cabaret to deliver the repaired outfit. Immediately captivated by the rhythmic drums and the swirling dancers see finds herself returning night after night to absorb the music and atmosphere.

Eventually she musters up enough courage to try it for herself. With only a few quick pointers from the girls she borrows an outfit and takes the stage. While her technique is poor and amateurish, her energy and enthusiasm draws the attention of the male patrons and she soon becomes the most popular performer. Her success at the cabaret slowly begins to bring about positive changes in Lilia life, as she faces her problems with the same determinatiion she brings to her dancing. Eventually she becomes a self-confident, assertive woman who can once again embrace life and love.

The music is fantastic, the atmosphere exotic and Hiam Abbass is the perfect mixture of innocence and sensuality. Highly recommended!",1134086400,9,1457,4.9105691056910565
1877162,5,B000093FJJ,"This movie is a wonderfull piece, one of the best foreign movies recently made. The story is rich and the dance scenes simply real and amazing. It shows how can any womam change her life into a more fullfilling existence in any stage of her life. And yes, bellydancing can be a liberating and empowering experience to all of us. A must for all bellydancers!",1103932800,4,357,4.507692307692308
1877163,5,B000093FJJ,"We begin the film following a beautiful widower in her apartment and community. She has a daughter whom she loves and cares for very much, but for her life does not stop because you are a mother. The protagonist, Lilia is a simple yet complex woman, who is not satisfied with the banalities of everyday life. We see her thinking and wondering all the time. She struggles between balancing her life as a mother, the need to express her femininity and to fulfill her desires.
Magically like we say in the Bled, the  ""Maktoub"" leads her to Belly Dancing. Finaly,it is through that art form that our heroine finds her medium to self-understanding and freedom.
Although the film is about a North African woman Tunisian specifically, the theme is a universal one.
So to all the nomads on the journey, go out there and find your ""Sating Rouge""",1089849600,7,836,4.648648648648648
1877164,5,B000093FJJ,"""Great movie"", though it goes against what I strive to educate my dance students on the ethics of Belly Dance and how it is not intended to be performed souly for a mans pleasure.  It does speak to many women striving to overcome their cacoon of melancholy and hidden passions.  Believe me ladies, this one will make you want to dance and appreciate your body as it is!  This movie was enspiring and did not stereotype what a Belly dancer should look like, the music will move you and the story is spirited.

1877165,5,B000093FJJ,"What an awesome movie!! Loved it. It spoke to many of us plain janes who looked into a mirror while shimmying to the music. Later, she was as captivated by the sparkle of the sequins, the flow of the silk and the excitement of the stage as many us are. The humor was great, the women's issues were interesting and the ""belly dance cabaret"" topic was clearly handled. I recommend it.",1076284800,2,382,4.394366197183099
1877166,3,B000093FJJ,"It was great to see an authentic belly dancing story. I'm a bellydancer who has over five years of performing experience, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to see a Tunesian story about a belly dancer. Unfortunately, the film confirmed my suspicion that belly dancers in the Middle East are what strippers are to the West. It is clear early in the film that a ""respectable"" woman wouldn't belly dance, and the many scenes in the cabaret confirm my analogy is correct. In the final scene, the middle-aged heroine is looking foolish as she belly dances desperately to seek attention.
I was expecting a story of feminine empowerment, and I got the opposite. As well, I was expecting great dance scenes, and again I got the opposite. As far as the story goes, the film's director underestimates the viewers' intelligence.
That said, it would be absolutely crazy for any belly dancer to pass this movie up. Authentic dancing in its native cultural setting is something so few of us ever get to experience. It's worth it just for that education. Although it wasn't what I hoped for, it was engaging and entertaining, and the music was great. Finally, the subtitles were well displayed and easy to read.",1066780800,12,1206,4.77511961722488

That why I believe its done so well in America.  I love a women that will do wht she wants, and she did make an improvement in her life.  She live so poorly, she didn't strip.

7988805,4,B000093FJJ,"Sweet, and ultimately surprisingly complex. A middle aged Tunisian widow re-discovers herself and her sexuality through belly dancing at a nightclub.

For a while it plays a bit like a Hollywood fantasy (her transition from mousy loner to extroverted pro belly dancer is absurdly quick and easy), but with time the film grows into areas of greater subtlety; not just a woman breaking free in a repressive culture, but spotlighting the wonderful sexiness of a self-accepting woman in her 40s (something few western films do), and the dark along with the light that comes with sexual liberation (the club is right on the edge of feeling like a creepy strip club, where a number of the dancers works as prostitutes).

Throw in the fact that our heroin sleeps (unknowingly) with her daughter's boyfriend and yet is neither condemned or punished for it, plus the film's deliberately ambiguous ending involving said boyfriend and daughter, and the film completely transcends its 'Flashdance goes Islam' first half to become something wonderful and emotionally complex.",1436918400,,1081,5.236994219653179

It is not the best performance by Hiam Abbass, whom I adore, and hope will not be offended by this comment.  I blame the photography also, poor quality, almost out of focus most of the time, and not for special effects, I do not think.  Maybe, cheap camera equipment, and less than expert cinematographers.

7988810,5,B000093FJJ,"As a native of the Middle East (Egypt) who had to leave his beloved native land because of extreme religious fundamentalism, totalitarian government policies; as well as burgeoning oppressive religious rules and codes for women, I am in a privileged position to appreciate this movie. It is a tangible, visual and most courageous challenge to extreme conservative Islam or any other religion or group that imposes values/behaviors on the individual members of their groups that reduce their humanity to a vegetative level thus wasting millions of female lives with great potential. Hiam Abbas is a rare combination of great acting, courage and enchanting beauty, not to mention her prolific belly dancing. And the big bonus is that the film is most entertaining by all International and Intercultural standards. I bought it and watch it over again periodically! enjoy it",1370304000,,870,5.266187050359712
