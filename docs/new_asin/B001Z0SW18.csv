8348254,3,B001Z0SW18,"I really like this film, having seen it when it originally premiered. However, I feel if you are going to sell a media product, you should invest a little money and attention to detail and ensure the film to DVD transfer is acceptable. In this age of digital remastering, it is not. I know as anal as Mike Hoover (please Google this complex, driven, somewhat tragic and legendary cinematographer/director sometime) is about attention to detail before, during and after production, he never would have given this DVD his blessing. Before long, all celluloid and video copies of this film will be gone and this DVD is all we'll have. Such an unfortunate legacy for such a great film, no matter how contrived the details of the story are. 'The making of' section of the DVD is poorly done, but in its defense it was at the cutting edge of independent adventure filmmaking at the time.

Regardless of my above criticism, if you're a climber from the 'old school', a mountaineering historian, an armchair adventurer, or even an inspirational speaker that needs to have a few minutes of fill time in their presentation, I highly recommend getting this DVD, as most of the film and video copies of this movie are long gone. Back in the mid-seventies when I began climbing, this is how it was done; no-frills style, unlike today with all the indiscriminate bolting and expensive cams and fancy mountain wear that reflect more about status than climbing ability.",1297382400,4,1453,4.812
8348255,5,B001Z0SW18,"Wonderful short film and excellent production. SOLO is a remarkable documentary about climbing, showing something to reach. One, is touched and moved by this climber who shows us that things in our life are not so easy but at the end, the reward is great. We are not alone and sometimes we need the help of someone, found in our way, to be motivated in reaching our goals.
The first time I watched this film was in 1976 when I was a highschool student and some years later in 1985 I got a copy in tape (Beta format).
I was looking for this film in DVD since several years ago and now, it is a great surprise to have this release. I recommend this documentary not only for someone interested in climbing but also for teachers, students, and general public as an element of motivation in order to have the courage for solving all the troubles we find in our daily life. Don't miss it !!",1265500800,2,884,4.331325301204819
