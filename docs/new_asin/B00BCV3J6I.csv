8566463,5,B00BCV3J6I,"My three year old loves Word Girl and this series of episodes, like all the others on the PBS series, are very high quality educational programs that are very engaging as they help build children's vocabularies.

My wife made a Word Girl costume for my daughter that she almost refuses to take off.",1405641600,,298,4.622641509433962
8566464,3,B00BCV3J6I,"I love Word Girl in general. This is a good one, because the monster turns out to be sweet.  Most of the other villans are okay...like that...but watch out for Miss Power...who uses the power of words to hurt people. She is glamorized and my kids want to be like her.....I'm still trying to back pedal from that.",1386720000,4,312,4.379310344827586
8566465,5,B00BCV3J6I,Word Girl is a fast-paced attention-keeping educational program which is entertaining for ages 2 to 92!  My daughter loves to dance along with Captain Huggy-Face at the end of each episode.,1377561600,,189,5.096774193548387
8566466,5,B00BCV3J6I,"Honestly Wordgirl is a show I didn't think my kids would like or get, but I was wrong.  I think they have seen it before on PBS but having a whole DVD was perfect for them.  If you (or your child) has never seen Wordgirl, it is a show where a girl is both a regular girl and a superhero, along with her sidekick who is a monkey!  The show is all about vocabulary words with it teaching eight new vocabulary words in the four episodes.  I am amazed at how my kids pay attention to this show even though the main character is a girl and its about words, I guess they haven't realized I want them to watch it because its educational!  What is great though about the vocabulary words is that not only do the characters use the words but they explain they explain the words.  My boys even repeat them and I think they are understanding them.  The show is also unlike other animated shows though which is a nice break.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1369353600,3,986,4.207446808510638
