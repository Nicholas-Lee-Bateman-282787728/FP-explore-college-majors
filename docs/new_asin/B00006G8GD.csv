1754143,4,B00006G8GD,"This screwball farce must have been quite provocative in it's day but would be considered tame by today's standards.  There's still alot to enjoy here even though the film doesn't attain the classic heights of Alec Guiness' Ealing work.  It's kind of a departure for Guiness to play such an amoral heel and he seems to relish it.  And he does a mean flamenco as demonstrated in his scenes with Yvonne DeCarlo.  Speaking of DeCarlo, she's a revelation here as the saucy Spanish vixen that Guiness' captain has holed up in Tangiers.  She not only smolders onscreen but she has a deft comic touch.  Celia Johnson is good as well as the proper English wife that Guiness assumes is content with the role he prescribes for her.  On the whole a consistently funny film.  Watch for a clever twist at the end that took me by surprise because there is no way it would have passed American censors at that time and took me aback that it passed British censors.",1129334400,2,949,4.541176470588235
1754144,3,B00006G8GD,"Alec Guinness is one of my favorite actors, and I'm especially fond of the films he made with Ealing, including such gems as THE LAVENDER HILL MOB, THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT, and KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS.  However, among Guinness's Earling comedies, this is the least among his efforts.  The basic problem with the film is twofold.  On the one hand, the film embarks with an ill assorted group of elements and a weak script that never pulls those elements together.  In fact, many of the conceits of the film are a bit too obvious and heavy handed to succeed as comedy.  I'm thinking of the gifts that the captain gives to his two wives, or the way he rigidly forces each one to adhere to the role he has charted for them, or the constant way his first mate refers to the captain as a ""genius,"" when nothing even especially clever is detectable in his actions.

The story is of a ship captain who runs a regular route between North Africa and Gibraltar who has not merely a girlfriend in each port but a wife.  But each one is selected to cater to a particular set of needs.  His wife in North Africa is a wild, unbridled, dancing, hard drinking party girl (played by Canadian Yvonne de Carlo), while his wife in Gibraltar is a solid, unpretentious, conservative (or so he thinks) homebody (played by the great Celia Johnson, in one of her rare film appearances).  Predictably, each one wants to break out of the role he has prescribed for them: the hottie wants to cook and wear and apron, and the stay-at-home wants to go dancing and wear a bikini.  The problem is that this is all only superficially funny, and while all the principles do the best that they can under the conditions, it all doesn't add up to very much.

The film is moderately enjoyable for two reasons:  first, Guinness is a joy to watch even in a lesser role, second, the film contains some fascinating location shots.  It was amazingly interesting to see the shots of early fifties Gibraltar and Africa, although none of the actors actually appeared in them (one shot of Guinness walking along a street in Gibraltar obviously was the result of film of him being superimposed on the location footage).  As much as I like Celia Johnson, this simply wasn't a very good role for her.  All in all, one at the end feels that so much more should have resulted from all of this.  I can moderately recommend the film for Guinness and Ealing completists, but overall I don't think it is much of a film.

I should point out that Alec Guinness was a real life ship captain.  During WW II, before his screen success, he captained landing ships.  He liked in interviews to boast of having been in charge of the first ship to hit the shore in the invasion of Sicily.  Unfortunately, that experience didn't seem to help this film very much.",1099958400,4,2797,4.490118577075099
1754145,4,B00006G8GD,"A deft, charming dark comedy featuring Alec Guinness as a crafty sea captain who has achieved the ultimate male chauvinist dream: the foolproof scheme to cheat on his wife.  Wives, actually.  He has one in each port -- a dowdy, respectable English frump stowed away in Gilbralter, and a wild, exotic hottie at his love shack in Tangiers.  Complications ensue, of course, and while the subtext of sexist humor may be dated or offensive, the script is quite skillful and the performances grand.  A lot of attention will go to Yvonne De Carlo, who plays Alec's Latin lady, but the plum comedic role goes to English actress Celia Johnson, who liberates her mousy character with an economical and hilarious transformation.  Guinness is great, too... but you knew that already, right? A very funny film.",1062806400,8,797,4.917910447761194
1754146,5,B00006G8GD,"I recently purchased The Horse's Mouth (1958) from Amazon as well as ""The Alec Guinness Collection"" which includes The Captain's Paradise (1953) plus four others: Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), and The Ladykillers (1955). Frankly, I was amazed how well each of the six films has held up since I first saw it.

Although I do not rank The Captain's Paradise in the highest echelon of Guinness' comedies, his character is nonetheless a highly entertaining variation on Thurber's Walter Mitty. As the film begins, Captain Henry St. James seems to be having his cake and eating it too. In a word, bigamy. He has Maud in Gibraltar (played by Celia Johnson) and Nita (played by Yvonne de Carlo) in North Africa. This ship's captain has not only a girl but a devoted wife in each port. Working with a script by Alex Coppel-Nicholas Phipps and directed by Anthony Kimmins, Guinness is in fine form as both the prim and proper husband of homebody Maud and the night clubbing companion of the sultry Nita. One of the oldest and most effective of comic devices is the role reversal. In reality, Maud yearns to be viewed as St. James sees Nita and Nita...you get the idea. That is the basic conceit of this delightful film.

The plot developments accelerate when St. James purchases what he deems to be appropriate gifts for his two wives, only to get them mixed up and inadvertently gives the wrong one to each. Their reactions threaten his paradise. How does he handle the crisis? What is his situation as the film ends? And are there any lessons to be learned from all this? Judge for yourself. One final point: If you have not already seen this and the other four films in ""The Alec Guinness Collection,"" I envy you. I really do.",1057449600,28,1786,4.630914826498422
1754167,5,B00006G8GD,Excellent classic movie. I didn't know that Yvonne De Carlo could speak fluent Spanish. Just another reason to love an actress I have always loved.,1407110400,,147,4.92
1754168,4,B00006G8GD,"A very slim little story here, with a single idea that's probably carried on a bit beyond its potential, but it's so delightfully done.

The premise is no more than a Captain who has a domesticated mousey wife in one port (Gibraltar) and a hot tamale girlfriend at the other end, ...somewhere in North Africa).
He thinks it is the ""perfect"" arrangement! (As long as each remains unknown to the other.)
And he intends to keep it that way!

What happens is that each of the women start to morph into the other's mindset.
The sex-bomb wants the domesticity of married life and cooking, while the housewife longs to throw off her aprons and kick her heels up in nightclubs.
Alec Guinness plays his part with gusto, ...speaking largely in what I assume to be Spanish, and his character is certainly not above a bit of male chauvinism in his attempts to keep his worlds separate and his own enjoyment complete.
(To hell with what the women might want!)

He buys his wife domestic appliances and aprons as anniversary presents to reinforce the role he wants her to play.
He buys his girlfriend sexy lingerie and bikinis!
When his wife threatens to become too outgoing he selfishly gets her pregnant to keep her at home and ""busy"".  With twins!

Of course he is the one who suffers in the end.
This is a morality tale after all, despite its apparent endorsement of marital infidelity in the first part of the movie.

It's a bit too long overall in the telling of such a slight story, but certainly worth seeing for a couple of reasons.

It's probably the only time you'll get to see Obi Wan Kenobi perform a couple of quite vigorous Latin American dance routines!
His partner is Yvonne de Carlo, and her heel-stamping knees up solos wearing a couple if quite ill-fitting tacky flamenco outfits are also something of a treat, ..although probably more amusing than arousing.
She tries hard but she's no great dancer, despite the hair tossing and skirt lifting.
She's right into the champagne though, ...a hint of her later personal descent into alcoholism.

Most of the fun comes mainly from the visuals, ....the script not exactly sparkling with wit or repartee. A lot of it is in foreign language, although don't be put off by that as it doesn't matter at all really.
And despite the apparently dire situation of the opening sequence, I'm sure you will pre-suppose the ending long before it comes.
Another visual gag!

The b-&-w print is excellent here, but like a lot of transfers, the audio levels do fluctuate.

It's a light comedy, definitely worth viewing for the visuals and to see Obi Wan boogie, but did any one manage to work out the significance of the recurring appearances of that very over-dressed sheik?",1397088000,,2709,4.684210526315789

1754175,4,B00006G8GD,"Among all Guinness's extraordinary efforts in the 1950's, Captain's Paradise surely ranks with the best of them. It's not so much his performance which triumphs as much as the film itself, with an innovative and easy to follow story structure that surprised me. The thing you've gotta love about British comedies is they are so literate yet easy to follow. The writing is just so solid. As they say in Hollywood, it's a ""high concept"" story, well executed, as it were.

Guinness as Captain Henry St. James seems to have the best of everything as he shuttles between Gibraltar and Morocco on his passenger vessel, enjoying the life of an intellectual yet bon vivant Captain both aboard his vessel and with his sultry girlfriend in Tangier or something (played with lusty gusto by the ravishing Yvonne De Carlo!) and a more placid married life with his obedient wife (Celia Johnson) back in the British territory of Gibraltar. It is the strong male fantasy element that kept me coming back for more.

From the tender mercies of a firing squad to the miserable life of the two-timing bigamist (the flamenco dancing scene with Guinness and DeCarlo was the best!), Paradise is a film full of invidious and cross-cultural comparisons placed in an amusing and comical light. It's supposedly ""male-chauvinist"" investigation into the nature of marriage and relationships, with the Euro-British twist, is particularly enlightening. What is most unusual about the film is that, unlike most situation comedies, it takes place over a significant span of time -- time enough for his ladies to change their stripes.

While Anthony Kimmins is not a famous director, I like his transparent, easy-going style, and his use of straight-on closeups was excellent. Kimmins doesn't get in the way of the story at all.

The only bad thing I can say about this film is the ending to the story is not fully resolved, just implied. They skipped over some details in the interest of achieving a brisk 96 minutes. That's OK.

I could hear foreshadowings of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in that excellent score by Malcolm Arnold (who scored both films -- many of the same ""climbing dread"" chord progressions), plus the fact that Guinness is also, in this film, a commander in uniform, once again reminds me of Kwai.

For the infinitely malleable Guinness (this time in the sneaky rascal mold), and the very delicious, sexy Yvonne DeCarlo, this is a film you don't want to miss. Highly entertaining.",1319846400,,2466,4.915865384615385
1754176,4,B00006G8GD,"The Captain's Paradise (1953), is another brisk, (94 minutes), silly little black and white classic of English comedy that could, I guess best be classified as a romantic comedy.  It's witty, and rather high-concept, with a plot that's a seamless sweetly spun sly confection, and was nominated for a Best Writing Oscar.  It stars the uber-talented Alec Guinness.

Here he plays the title part in the movie, a part that might have been tailored just for him: Mediterranean ferryboat captain Henry St. James.  The Captain has things nicely organized for himself, thank you very much: He's got a loving, conventional, ""veddy"" English wife Maud (Celia Johnson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brief-Encounter-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780023420/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brief Encounter - Criterion Collection</a>) in the restricted British colony of Gibraltar; and a possessive, hot-blooded mistress Nita (Yvonne De Carlo,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McLintock/dp/B000006OS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McLintock!</a>),  in Spanish Morocco.  It's a perfect arrangement, as long as he can keep them apart. But what happens when one woman decides to follow him to the other port?

Guinness is said to have respected, and enjoyed working with De Carlo, who is said to have found this one of her best roles.  She had supposedly been a professional dancer, and is said to have taught him the tango for their memorable dance scene.  Furthermore, this movie allows Johnson a chance to give her hanky a rest: she doesn't cry once. Guinness has also got some strong supporting players in this one.  Miles Malleson (KIND HEARTS) plays Lawrence St. James; Charles Goldner plays Chief Officer Ricco; Bill Fraser is Absalom, the taxi driver.

The movie was filmed on location at Gibraltar, and at Shepperton Studios; it was not made by Ealing Studios, powerhouse of British comedy in the 1950s.  The movie was remade as a mediocre TV entertainment, centered upon an airline stewardess, titled COFFEE, TEA OR ME, in 1973.  CAPTAINS PARADISE is a well-known and much-honored movie.  It's sexist, of course, but I wouldn't go getting all bent out of shape about that.

I found this movie to be more of a study of female psychology rather than the male.

We learn that most women have two sides; naughty, and nice.

This is why men find women like Sophia Loren (not in this movie) so attractive, because Sophia is 'Good' and 'Bad' at the same time.

He himself changes character to suit as he goes back and forth, and gradually fades from one into the other with each trip.

1754192,4,B00006G8GD,"""The Captain's Paradise"" is a very droll comedy in which Alec Guinness plays against type as a sophisticated Don Juan with 2 women in his life, each representing the 2 halves, in his words, of the perfect woman. One is Celia Johnson ,the proper little English housewife, drab, unimaginative, eager to please and sexless. The other is continental Yvonne De Carlo, sexy, flamboyant and exciting. The film ran into problems with the censors when it was released in America and it is easy to see why because it covers adultery and suggests bigamy. If the script is full of sexist cliches, who cares.

This is one film where Guinness's renowned versatility is outshone by the woman. Underrated De Carlo is hilarious, beautifully balancing her sex appeal with a very feminine warmth while Johnson's eager attempts to please are a standout. The film is very well made and the story unfolds logically building to a climax but a rather silly denouement. There is a very funny running gag about rissoles.

The DVD print is pristine but the extras are spartan. The original  trailer is included plus a brief biographical essay on Guinness. The best is the insert in the DVD case which is a neat summary of interesting background to the the making of the film, particularly the problems with the censor.

(Warning: SPOILERS ahead.) The captain treats each woman as one aspect of the complete, perfect companion. But eventually, both women rebel, refuse to be regarded as less than complete human beings, and dump him. Thus his chauvinism receives its just punishment. But to have shown him utterly destroyed would have left the audience sympathetic, and would have weakened the moral rather then strengthening it.

The captain's search for paradise appears to have been reached -- he has a wife on each side of the straits, and each wife specializes in some aspect of the perfect wife -- one is sexy, Spanish, and exotic, the other is domestic and very British.

On the ship ""Golden Fleece"", docked at the port, the ship's crew are grimly waiting as a civilian pushes his way in. The man is the captain's uncle, and the ship's first mate (I assume) tells the man that the man being executed is the ship's captain, and the uncle asks why, so the first mate explains.

The Golden Fleece is a ferry ship regularly sailing between Gibraltar and this North African city, and its captain was married to two wives: one in the city who is a dancer who always has fun, goes dancing, and eats out all the time, and a British wife in Gibraltar who is a dutiful housewife who stays at home and does domestic chores. The captain had the two wives with the idea that he could enjoy the characteristics of both kinds in each of his homes. The wives do not know of each other, and the captain gives presents to each of his wives to suit their respective lifestyles. Then one day, the captain mixes up the presents and the party girl wife gets an apron while the housewife gets a swimsuit. Then things start falling apart.

The movie begins with a light, farcical tone, but as it goes on, the mood darkens as the wives become dissatisfied with their respective marriages and the captain tries and fails to keep them in the roles he wants them to play-and becomes truly dark as we find that this supposedly charming and genial captain really is not.
