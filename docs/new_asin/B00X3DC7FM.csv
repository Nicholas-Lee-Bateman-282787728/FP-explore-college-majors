7156341,2,B00X3DC7FM,"Personally, I don't see what  any of the other reviewers saw in this movie that would make anyone want to watch this, care about what happens to ANY of the characters or see anything that is the least bit scary. I thought the story was predictable and boring, the acting, mediocre and the whole movie to me, was just not worth my time or my money. Everyone is different and likes different things, but I just couldn't find anything in this film that I would recommend to anyone.",1441497600,,478,4.431818181818182
7156342,3,B00X3DC7FM,"John (Robert Englund) is a washed up, 9 week sober actor who scores a gig in Doylestown, Pa....The land of missing pets. If you take note, the German Shepard that later appears was lost near Elm and Pine. Nicholas (Daniel Gadi) has gathered a group of actors for his play, which they will perform at the manor where they all will stay. He has an old book and when the actor touches the book, they become the character in the book, except for John, who in real life is like the character in the play. ""Kantemir"" is the name of the play which hails from the name of a Bulgarian village. If you read the by-line for the film, you should be able to realize that the play will take on a form of ""10 Little Indians.""

I guess if you have never seen something like this before, say you are 13, you might find this entertaining. But for a seasoned movie watcher, wait for a Redbox special.  2 1/2 stars

Guide: No sex or nudity. I don't recall any bad language. Adult talk of sex",1441411200,,971,4.209677419354839
7156343,5,B00X3DC7FM,"Loved this movie.  It was full of romance, betrayal, guilt, passion and tragedy.  It is like a modern Shakespeare play.  It is a story that begins a couple hundred years ago and is doomed to replay itself for all of eternity.  I would definitely buy this movie to watch over and over.  It has all the elements that makes a story great and long lasting.  Years from now this story will still be as good then as it is now.",1441152000,6,420,4.1875

7156345,3,B00X3DC7FM,"Good to see Englund, but meh, nothing to praise, nothing to rant about.",1440720000,,71,4.538461538461538
7156346,4,B00X3DC7FM,"The story is in the tradition of the Bros. Grimm fairytales in their original, un-sanitized format; pre 20th century diabetic coma inducing, dumbed downed, sugar coated animations.
These ""fairytales"" were in fact, morality stories that were intended to frighten children to their hair roots; a nitro charged version of Aesop's Fables from the dark side.

In ""Kantemir"" we are treated to a classic ""be careful what you wish for"" story presented within a clever premise; a manuscript of a cursed play bound in an ancient bejeweled leather binding.

All the actors are already predisposed by their inherent attributes to breathe life into the cursed characters in the play; which is a flattering nod to a certain famous episode from the Twilight Zone series.

The overall performances are more than adequate to treat the viewer to believable portrayals of their respective characters, but I feel this is more a tribute to skillful directing rather than an accurate reflection of the skills of a number of the actors.

Mr. Englund's overall performance is assuring and evenhanded; but marred with a few uncomfortable erratic moments while trying to juggle the very difficult split second timing required to portray the near schizophrenic, multiple personality demands of his role.

His skill and screen presence convey the confidence and practiced hand of a seasoned professional which is a delight.

Perhaps with a larger budget and/or better writing, this story could have lived up to it's full potential but in spite of these restraints, the most is made of what was available and succeeds valiantly; thus earning 4 stars, whereas in less capable hands it would have been 3 stars at best,",1440633600,6,1687,5.116363636363636

8714863,5,B00X3DC7FM,"Kantemir has a good mix of creepiness, humor and romance I liked the look of the movie and found the premise to be interesting.  At first I thought the writer could have developed some of the characters better some of them are kind of two-dimensional, but as I kept watching and got pulled into the storyline, I realized that maybe this is what the screenwriter intended  for the cast to come across like puppets under a spell. The acting is not bad either. Robert Englund is amazing as usual.",1480896000,,493,4.52808988764045
8714864,2,B00X3DC7FM,"Again, another movie where the preview had me hooked but just failed to deliver.  I also felt like I had seen this before but can't quite place where.",1466899200,,150,4.357142857142857
8714865,3,B00X3DC7FM,Mediocre,1464566400,,8,8.0
8714866,5,B00X3DC7FM,"If you're looking for Krueger, he ain't here, but if you want to see Robert Englund in his best performance outside the Freddy suit, check this movie out! It actually has a story, a bit convoluted at times, but worth sticking with it for the solid cast, and super cool location shots. This isn't buckets of blood but there are a few good thrills, and it's definitely unique amongst the run-of-the-mill horror pics out there.",1445212800,,424,4.666666666666667

8714869,4,B00X3DC7FM,"KANTEMIR has less blood and gore than a person would expect out of a Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) movie, but I really enjoyed it anyway. It was like a haunted fairytale different, in a good way.  In the movie, a group of actors are called together to rehearse for a play, but as the story goes on, the actors start to behave like the roles they're cast in even when they're not rehearsing. They are losing their grip on reality and John (Englund) is the only one that seems to know what is going on and then to break out of the curse, someone has to step up and become the hero... but I won't spoil that for you.  I really liked the cinematography and music too. KANTEMIR is not a straight horror though.  Its the kind of fantasy-thriller that guys can watch with their girlfriends. Just don't be surprised when your girlfriend, wife, gal pal, whatever, likes it more than you.",1444176000,,880,4.419753086419753
