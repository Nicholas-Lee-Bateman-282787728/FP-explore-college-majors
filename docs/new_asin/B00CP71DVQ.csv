8644391,5,B00CP71DVQ,The Sveshnikov is one of the most complex variations of the Sicilian Defense but GM Krasenkow does a superb job of helping viewers navigate the complex strategies involved in this system.  This DVD is definitely for the more advanced player who doesn't mind taking on sharp middlegame positions against his White opponent.,1389657600,,322,5.1923076923076925
8644392,2,B00CP71DVQ,"I expected more from this DVD about the Sveshnikov.
Krasenkov's Explanations  are very interesting, but the theory explained is too short.
Krasenkov omitted several critical lines, since the theory is very general and superficial way.
It is a DVD for players with ELO between 2000-2200 (fide).
I suggest that for further DVD's theory, a file for Chessbase or Fritz to items comets and small encyclopedia, or attach more detailed theory.",1389312000,,436,5.228571428571429
