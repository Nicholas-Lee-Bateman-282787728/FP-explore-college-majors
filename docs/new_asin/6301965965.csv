383566,5,6301965965,"""A Day at the Races"" is a Marx brothers cornucopia of comical craziness, musical magnificence, and horse hilarity. Groucho, Harpo, and Chico show their comic superiority in several scenes, and in some they are able to combine the comedy with their musical abilities (i.e. Harpo's piano/harp concerto). The supporting cast is excellent also as Allan Jones sings his way into the heart of Maureen O'Sullivan, Margaret Dumont tries to capture Groucho's affections, the authorities try to capture whoever they can, and the horse tries to capture first place.

383767,4,6301965965,"A Day at The Races is a very good Marx Brothers film. Some will say that A Night at The Opera was funnier; and perhaps they are right. Nevertheless, this is a very well done film with great acting, casting, fine musical numbers including Harpo playing his harp--the cinematography and choreography are excellent, too! In addition, the quality of the print is rather good.

When the action starts, we meet Judy (Maureen O'Sullivan) who owns and operates a sanitarium in the country near a horse racing track. Unfortunately for Judy, times are bad at the sanitarium and she may be forced to give it up for not being able to pay a financial note on the property. Morgan (Douglass Dumbrille) offers Judy money for the sanitarium but Judy refuses; she still has one month to come up with the money. Judy's boyfriend Gil (Allan Jones) has his own plan: he buys High Hat, a race horse, for $1,500--everything he's got; Gil hopes that High Hat will win an important race and get them the money to keep the sanitarium open. What Judy doesn't know, however, is that her assistant Whitmore (Leonard Ceeley) is in cahoots with Morgan; Whitmore wants to help Morgan get the sanitarium, close it and open a casino to go with Morgan's race track and nightclub.

But of course things become even more complicated. One very wealthy and histrionic patient at the sanitarium who just might give Judy the money to keep it open, Mrs. Upjohn (Margaret Dumont), insists she is ill while the doctors can't find anything wrong with her. When Mrs. Upjohn hears that Dr. Hackenbush might come to the sanitarium, she tells Judy she will help financially--if Hackenbush comes. What almost nobody knows is that the prestigious Dr. Hackenbush (Groucho Marx) is actually a veterinarian!

A lot more happens; but I won't write too much more because I don't want to spoil it for you. The ""tootsie frootsie"" ice cream scene is hilarious. Look also for some very funny situations when Morgan and Whitmore try everything they can think of to expose Hackenbush as a fraud while the Sherriff (Robert Middlemass) tries to keep High Hat out of any races for his own reasons. Harpo Marx plays Stuffy, the jockey who rides High Hat and who wants to help Judy keep the sanitarium open; and Sig Ruman is terrific as Dr. Steinberg. Esther Muir plays Flo, an attractive woman working with Whitmore and Morgan to frame Hackenbush.

The musical numbers are quite good as a mentioned above; Allan Jones sings so well and there's a chorus of ""All God's Chillun Got Rhythm"" by Ivie Anderson and The Crinoline Choir. While the lyrics and the blackface are embarrassingly dated and offensive, Ivie shines as a first-rate performer who could really belt out a tune. Wow, did Ivie have talent!

The DVD comes with nice extras. There is an optional commentary by Glenn Mitchell; ""On Your Marx, Get Set, Go;"" ""A Night at The Movies;"" ""Vintage Cartoons;"" an ""Audio Vault"" and even the theatrical trailer.

A Day at The Races is a must-have for Marx Brothers' aficionados; fans of the other actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections. Of course, anyone who appreciates classic comedies will not be disappointed.",1344124800,2,3175,4.774134790528233
383768,5,6301965965,"The Marx Bros on top form with fine singing from Allan Jones and the marvellous Margaret remaining straight-faced throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I read some reviews from perhaps younger people saying the film is disjointed with little story line but the film is really to show case the abilities and humour of the Marx Brothers. They may seem old-fashioned now but their humour is really superb and their timing spot on. Groucho is obviously the intelligent one, Chico plays the piano with gusto and a touch of humour while Harpo does look transported when he plays the harp.  He is in another world. On the DVD I received, there is a special feature of Allan Jones singing ""A Message from the Man in the Moon"" which song I've wanted to hear for years. You only hear a snippet of it in the dance sequence and at the end when the race is won and Groucho sings a few lines to Margaret. I was really overjoyed to hear the song sung in full. I wish it had been left in and the ballet sequence dropped.

383857,3,6301965965,"A Day at the Races (Sam Wood, 1937)

As long as I've been a movie fan, I've been hearing about A Day at the Races and how incredible it is. Many critics refer to it in the kind of tone one expects to hear when discussing, say, Orson Welles or The Godfather. I spent most of my life not really liking older comedy, having only really been exposed to the Three Stooges and that sort of thing, and have only recently discovered the genius of folks like Keaton and Chaplin, so I figured now was the time to try the Marx Brothers, and with my affinity for horse racing, this seemed like the movie to start with.

Hugo Hackenbush (Groucho) is a vet posing as the head of a mental institution. (Why? Who knows?) He gets himself tangled up with a racetrack tout (Chico), a happy-go-lucky jockey (Harpo), and a racehorse owner (Allan Jones, who got his start in this movie's companion piece, A Night at the Opera), trying to keep the sanitarium open with the help of a racehorse who's actually not much of a racehorse.

One of the things that I really like about Keaton, Chaplin, et al. is that their movies actually play out like movies, whereas my problem with acts like the Three Stooges is that the movies had a paper-thin plot whose sole reason for existence was to showcase the standup bits. That is also an exact description of A Day at the Races, though it also pauses for a number of musical bits in between the standup. And while some of those standup bits are funny, it's still a collection of bits mashed together to resemble a movie. Not bad, but I don't really get all the fuss. ***",1246147200,2,1587,4.372881355932203

It's great for most ages and audiences, as long as you're a little open-minded.",1231977600,,292,4.686274509803922
383860,4,6301965965,"When the Marx Brothers came to MGM in 1935, boy wonder producer Irving Thalberg had the good commercial sense to package them in a genuine musical comedy which widened their box office appeal enormously although it detracted from the pure gold of their earlier anarchic Paramount comedies.

""A Day at the Races"" followed the formula of the hugely successful ""A Night at the Opera"", but it was was the beginning of the end of their golden period. The problem is simply that while the boys are very good,  there is just not enough of them and in inverse proportion, a dumb love story with the charming Allan Jones and the equally charming but sappy Maureen O'Sullivan. Also, there is a notable softening of their  characters, particularly Harpo and that diminishes them.

The film also has 2 major production numbers - one is a dud balletic number but the other is another matter altogether. Just as you begin to cringe at the black stereotypes, a slim girl with a tantalising voice appears and, unbelievably, it is the famous jazz singer Ivie Anderson, with Duke Ellington's band backing and unbilled. Don't miss this historic glimpse of a really great black singer.

Having said that, most people who read this review will know the delights on offer, the Tootsie Fruitsy Ice cream routine for example. The package contains an excellent print and there are some very good extras. The commentary from Marx Brothers author Glenn Mitchell is full of background information which in fact becomes frustrating as Mitchell points out many discontinuities due to cuts. It seems the cuts were mainly on the boys' routines and maybe that was what upset the balance on offer. The package also includes a documentary which is most interesting with its clips of an elderly O'Sullivan and at its worst with the dreadful Dom DeLuise. A droll Robert Benchley short is OK but the cartoons are dated and dull. Best of all is an audio outake of Allan Jones singing ""The Man in the Moon"".  Jones had a beautiful tenor and it is a pity the song was not retained because it is infinitely more melodic than the overlong ballet which remains.

384003,5,6301965965,"The Marx Brothers had a run of four critically and commercial popular films for Paramount--but when DUCK SOUP was released in 1933 it tanked in a major way, so much so that Paramount was suddenly unenthusiastic about future projects.  Enter Irving Thalberg, who was best known for ""prestige pictures"" made at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, a studio that tended to emphasize family fare.  Thalberg and MGM seemed an unlikely venue for the anarchy of the Marx Brothers, but Thalberg had ideas--and the result was two extremely popular films: A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and A DAY AT THE RACES.

In both instances Thalberg placed the wild humor of the Marx Brothers at the service of a romantic subplot.  Where RACES is concerned, that plot is particular bizarre.  Judy Standish (Maureen O'Sullivan) has inherited a sanitarium and if she is unable to repay her debts she will be bought out by a casino!  Her fiancee Gil (Alan Jones) has a plan to save the day: he has bought a race horse and hopes to win the money she needs.  Judy finds the scheme ridiculous and turns instead to wealthy patient Emily Upjohn (the formidable Margaret Dumont)--who insists that Judy employ her favorite doctor, Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush.  And with a name like that, this can only be one actor: Groucho Marx.

Marx Brothers fans argue a lot about whether the Paramount or MGM films were better.  I tend to come down on the side of the Paramount films, which are edgier, but there's no denying that both A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and A DAY AT THE RACES are exceptionally entertaining films--and when you combine horse racing, a water ballet, a medical sanitorium, mistaken identities, and mix them thoroughly with some of the most outrageous one liners and set pieces imaginable... well, you have a classic on your hands.  The whole thing is a hoot, and if you can get through the famous Florida call scene without busting a gut you need to go to a sanitarium yourself.

The DVD release offers an extremely good, if not entirely pristine, print of the film and it comes with several bonuses.  Unfortunately, these are not particularly memorable; the commentary track is at best uninspired.  But who cares when you've got the Marx Brothers zinging along very close to the peak of their skills?  Strongly recommended.

384004,4,6301965965,"If you'e looking for ""Duck Soup"" you may have to settle for slightly diluted consomme, regarding the real comedy herein, although there are several excellent scenes which utilize the remarkable talents of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo (""tuttsie-frootsie"" ice-cream, a couple of examinations, one with Harpo, and one with Margaret Dumont), and there some good lines, but this enterprise must be considered a Hollywood musical with the Marx Brothers - and the music is fine. (And what a shame that two numbers were not used, Groucho's ""Dr. Hackenbush"", which would have worked beautifully in his first big scene at the Sanitarium; and Alan Jones' ""A Message From The Man In The Moon"", heard only as incidental music).
Talking about ""The Message"", it is one of the Features here, and should delight those longtime fans who have always enjoyed that small excerpt by Groucho during the formulaic ""cast call"" production number.
Yes, a Director like Leo McCarey, and additional writing support from folks like Kalmar and Ruby, plus a scaled down water ballet sequence, and cutting about 15 minutes, would have produced a great motion picture. But MGM could not match Hal Roach, Paramount, or Columbia, when it came down to upbeat comedy, despite some nice editing on the Dumont examination scene. The Groucho ""seduction scene"", if you will, with the bad guys' accomplice has all the right ingredients, the right look and feel, but the pace is too slow. A bigger error is in the story-telling department. It doesn't make much sense to use Chico as the affable con-artist to Groucho on the one hand, if he's the selfless beneficient soul for the lovers on the other hand. And if he does have this split-personality, then why wouldn't the writers simply have him summon up his old dependable friend Hugo Z. when he's working up his scheme?
As Glen Mitchell, our host/critic in the Features, points out, however, it was absolutely necessary to transform the Marx Brothers into family entertainers, and to smooth out the comedy and put it in a happy, smile up the aisle, framework. The previous two Paramount efforts were pure comedies, appealing more to ""educated"" males, at the time.
An Amazon reviewer effectively wrote that the mix of Jones and O'Sullivan has something over Jones and Carlysle from the previous MGM film.",1183248000,,2309,5.0
384005,5,6301965965,"One of the Marx Bros' nuttiest farces, ""Races"" has all the gut-busting gags you would expect from their follow-up to ""A Night at the Opera.""

384008,5,6301965965,"Sometimes formulas on the screen work for us, and other times they don't. When they don't, the results are often quite unbearable, but when they do... the results can be magical, even when feeling like we've already seen the same film numerous times before. A Day at the Races marked the sixth Marx Brothers film that I had seen, so I was quite familiar with the Marx Brothers formula going into the viewing. I imagine many of the original viewers of the film in 1937 were of a similar frame of mind when they went into the film as well given the number of Marx Brothers films that had been released up to that point.

I bring the notion of The Marx Brothers formula up for a couple of reasons: the first being that after seeing several of The Marx Brothers films it is impossible not to see the vast similarities between the various films. And yet, with that said, there is that special something that keeps bringing me back to them. The second being that I found myself to be such a fan of A Day at the Races, in large part, because I believe that it follows the Marx Brothers formula closer than any of the other Marx Brothers films I had previously seen.

The formula is essentially this: Groucho gets into some sort of trouble, Chico finds a way to get mixed into the trouble usually after some sort of scheme, and Harpo runs around being Harpo in the midst of it all. There is the ""straight man"" (Allan Jones in Opera & Races, Zeppo Marx in earlier films) with the romantic interest, Groucho makes fun of Margaret Dumont with jokes galore, Chico plays the piano, and there is the musical number at which point the plot comes to a stop while Harpo plays the Harp (which is probably my favorite piece of the formula). When you break the formula down, it may not sound like much. But in experiencing the formula, the sum becomes much greater than the parts.

While it may not have the funniest one-liners of any single Marx Brothers film, A Day at the Races excels in each piece of the Marx Brothers formula. From the comic results created by the confusion of veterinarian Hugo Z. Hackenbush (Groucho Marx) as a human doctor, to Chico's code book scheme outside of the horse betting windows, to the urban dance sequence led by Harpo towards the end of the film. I love the sequences between Groucho and Margaret Dumont in the film, and even the little touch of where/how Harpo finds a harp to play during that expected musical number adds an extra special something.

When choosing a favorite Marx Brothers film, most tend to be drawn towards Duck Soup or A Night at the Opera. But for me, I found myself to be smiling just a little bit wider at the formula elements in A Day at the Races. If I were to recommend just one Marx Brothers film to someone unfamiliar with their films, it would be A Day at the Races for that very reason.

Maureen O'Sullivan, one of the most beautiful and underrated of the MGM stars, gives a lively performance here as Judy Standish.  She's appealing, strong-willed, yet with a vulnerable streak that found its ultimate expression in the waifishness of her daughter Mia Farrow.  O'Sullivan's blonde beauty seems designed to play off both Allan Jones' clean-cut all American appeal, but also the garish, sexually charged performance of Groucho as Dr. Hackenbush.  Was there ever a more suggestive actor in the movies?  In the 30s, there was Clark Gable, and there was Groucho for when you wanted to get serious about the body.  When a guy taunts him, ""Are you a man or a mouse?"" Groucho doesn't turn a hair, just snaps out, ""Throw a piece of cheese on the floor and you'll find out,"" exactly the kind of repartee you'd get on a good day at Craig's List.

His grimaces, astonished glances, the quick swivel and point of his chin when challenged (or aroused), his bristling hair and beetle-like spectacles, here combine with the stethoscope of his ""medical fantasy"" to produce a vision of the id gone wild.

They don't call it a day at ""the races"" for nothing, for few MGM films had as many black actors working alongside the white ones.  True racial harmony.  The magical moment here is the only appearance (as far as I know) in a full length film of the incandescent Ellington singer Ivie Anderson, singing ""All God's Chillun Got Rhythm.""  I know, what a title!  But it is one of the most dazzling musical numbers ever captured on film.  Ivie Anderson (here billed as ""Ivy,"" but it seems she was one who honestly didn't care that much who spelled her name wrong or right) had one of the world's great voices, and she's given her due in this Sam Wood-directed number.  Alone it would be worth buying just for this track.  (There's also an Ellington short with Anderson singing Arlen's ""Stormy Weather,"" but this is miles better.)",1132704000,,2012,4.741379310344827

What clicked in ""A Night at the Opera"" doesn't gel nearly as well in this uneven MGM production. Running almost two hours, ""A Day at the Races"" suffers from excessive musical numbers and subplots that dilute some of the Marxes' best material. This film cries for some major editing  preferably a deletion of the ""Water Carnival"" ballet and the ludicrous ""All God's Children Got Rhythm"" number. If Thalberg had lived, ""A Day at the Races"" might have been a worthy follow-up to ""A Night at the Opera.""

One curiosity, as the movie goes to the horse race, the music is lifted from Night at the Opera.  The acting is fine and involved.  Margaret Dumont is a perfect foil for Groucho, and yet manages to keep her character through all of the antics.  The two best scenes involve Groucho's dinner date and the medical exam.  The Groucho/Chico banter this time around involves handycapping books.  Very funny and perfectly times.  Alan Jones is not given as much to do in this movie as in A Night at the Opera, but he still manages his part well.  This has more Harpo in it, and he is quite funny.  Why not 5 stars?

384105,5,6301965965,"Like a number of other reviewers, I also prefer this film to 'A Night at the Opera' (although that film is also terrific).  I just find 'A Day at the Races' funnier, personally, and with the plot more tightly constructed.  There's also more chemistry between Allan Jones (their best imitation Zeppo by far) and Maureen O'Sullivan than there was between Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle in the previous movie.  There's great comedic timing, gags, jokes, funny situations, classic routines, polished acting, you name it.  It is kinda slowed down in the middle by the superfluous song and dance performance, although it was common practice for a lot of films at the time, particularly at MGM, to have musical interludes.  I was much less bothered by the much talked about African-American musical performances the second time I watched this than I was the first.  Some of their speech, mannerisms, and facial expressions are cringe-inducing, even considering that this was actually probably considered pretty progressive by 1937 standards, although the overall scope of these performances is positive, certainly nothing like other films which depicted African-Americans via whites in blackface or which made them all out to be villains and caricaturish negative people, a la BOAN.

The extras are really good too; the documentary could have been longer, but I thought it was pretty good, covering well the making of this film and the stars behind it themselves.  There are also the original trailer for the film, a few audio extras, and some cartoons and short films from the era, probably to try to recreate what a night at the movies was like in 1937.  This was their last film that was truly great from start to finish, made just when they were on top of their game; we see glimpses of their former greatness in their later films, some more so than others, but never again did they make a film this great, funny, or tight.  Like is pointed out in the documentary, who knows what might have happened had Irving Thalberg not passed away during the filming?",1115510400,,2052,4.904624277456647
384106,5,6301965965,"I see a lot of people (not necessarily here, but in other Marx Brothers forums) get down on this movie, but I am inclined to disagree. I believe it's right up there with the Brothers' best, including Duck Soup and Night. ""Hack-in-a-bush"" is Groucho's self-proclaimed favorite role, and he is more natural in his acting here than I've ever seen. Harpo is hysterical as always and Margaret Dumont is brilliant... but I think the real stand-out in this one is Chico. I have never seen him having more fun. His acting is precise and true, his piano scene blows every other one out of the water and his grin is so adorable you can't help but grin back. Honestly, until I saw this Harpo was far and away my favorite, but after Day at the Races Chico is a very close contender. :)

Don't not get this one because you hear it's inferior! Yes, there are some forgettable scenes, but nobody's perfect, people. I think just the chance to see big-eyed Harpo innocently tooting away on his flute in a mass of jolly black workers yelling ""WHO'S THAT MAN?"" is worth the money.",1102464000,5,1061,4.4974093264248705
384107,5,6301965965,"""A Day at the Races"" is one of the better (but not best) of the Marx Brothers movies.  It has quick-witted humor evenly spaced throughout the movie and teams Groucho up with Margaret Dumont; his favorite straight woman.  He plays a horse doctor hired to head a sanitarium where Ms. Dumont is the bank-rolling hypochondriac.  Along the way the other brothers find their way into the plot.  The sanitarium is in danger of foreclosure and it turns out that the only way to save it is to win an upcoming horse race.  Oh well, good Marx Brothers movies don't require much of a plot.

There are a number of great comic scenes in the movie.  One of the best is Groucho having his expertise evaluated by other physicians.  One of the more interesting scenes involves Marx brothers spending time with the black community near the race track.  Some versions of the movie have expunged some of these scenes due to questionable taste.  However, I did not think that they were that bad for Hollywood in 1937.  There was a terrific musical number in one of those scenes and it would be a shame if it were editted out.  I can't vouch for this particular version since I have only seen the movie on TV.

This is not up in the league of ""Duck Soup"" or ""A Night at the Opera"" but is is still very good.  All of the first 6 Marx Brothers movies deserve a 5 star rating and a couple of them merit 6 stars.",1101945600,,1385,4.33852140077821
384108,4,6301965965,"I decided to watch this film again after an absence of probably 30 years when I learned that Dorothy Dandridge had a small part and I wanted to see if I could find her in the crowd. I'm not sure if I identified her or not but unexpectedly, I was absolutely blown away by the cameo of Ivy Anderson in ""All God's Chillun Got Rythym"". Her timing and delivery couldn't have been better and I strongly disagree with those who find the number too long and offensively stereotypical. I speak as one whose musical tastes are probably 80% classical and I do not often find much in popular music that I am enthusiastic about. Of course, the style and mannerisms of the black actors are dated and even stereotypical in the dance number that follows. But it has energy and enthusiasm and the paticipants at least seem to be having fun. The Marx brothers are not afraid to even poke fun at race issues by smearing grease on their face. In fact there are other ethnic stereotypes in the movie such as Chico's Italian persona and the German doctor that no one seems to object to because it is all in good fun and not malicious. In fact, the black race track workers are depicted sympathetically while the villains are greedy and underhanded whites trying to fix the race and steal the sanitarium. They lose and the race track workers stage a triumphal march at the end. I think for 1937 this is actually a pretty progressive film in terms of how black people were portrayed. I think that white audiences in 1937 had a mind set which limited how sympathically black people could be portrayed and humorous situations were a general rule.

 As for the rest of the movie there are some excellent and funny scenes that many have discussed before and I agree that some of the musical numbers with Alan Jones are too long and no longer that musically interesting. But there are lots of funny scenes and as usual, the brothers point their slings and arrows at the pompous and pretentious and malicious. That's why we can still appreciate them. And for those who find the ""God's Chillun"" number problematic, you're too politically correct. We have gone way beyond the 1930's image. Regretably, current stereotypes while sometimes striving for realism may lose empathy.",1091404800,17,2244,4.6498740554156175
384109,4,6301965965,"While not one of their absolute best, ""A Day at the Races"" is still a very good, very funny Marx Brothers movie. Most of Groucho's one-liners (""If I marry you, I'll never look at another horse again"") are good, and the short routines (particularly the 'tootsie frootsie ice cream' scam) are excellent as well. The only problem is the dreadful romantic subplot with Allan Jones and Maureen O'Sullivan, as well as some terrible musical numbers (like the dated ""All God's Chillun Got Lovin').
The DVD is in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and it looks fine. Glenn Mitchell, author of the superb ""Marx Brothers Encyclopedia,"" offers a commentary. There are way too many long gaps (especially towards the end), but it does offer a lot of interesting information. A radio ad and an outtake from the long-lost song ""Message From the Man on the Moon"" will be appreciated by scholars, and the inclusion of shorts and cartoons (include Robert Bencheley's ""A Night at the Movies"") makes for good entertainment.
Like its companion disc, ""A Night at the Opera,"" the only serious flaw is in the documentary. ""On you Marx, Get Set, Go!"" has several interviewees offering a limited amount of interesting insight into the film and the brothers (particularly the affordable comedian Dom DeLuise, who does some miserable jokes about food during his segments).",1089158400,,1342,4.995535714285714
384110,4,6301965965,"A DAY AT THE RACES is the second of the Marx/Wood/Thalberg collaborations (Marx Brothers, director Sam Wood and producer Irving Thalberg) movies made at MGM, the first the delightful A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.  Irving Thalberg (called ""the boy genius"" about a hundred times in the DVD extras) died partway through production, bringing this successful combination to an unhappy end.  Critical opinion will have you believe that NIGHT is the stronger of the two, but I've always preferred DAY.  I'm absolutely tickled to have it now on a fantastic DVD.
First, I think the jokes are just a little sharper and sillier here than in NIGHT (not that they were poor there by any means).  Also, the romantic subplot was handled a little better here.  It helps, I think, that Allan ""Imitation Zeppo"" Jones has better chemistry with Maureen O'Sullivan than he did with Kitty Carlisle.  The stricter structure that Thalberg imposed on the films is improved.  I have an entertaining time cheering on the Brothers' attempting to win a horserace to save a young heroine's sanitarium.
But, of course, the real fun from a Marx Brothers film comes from the one-liners and comedic set pieces that abound, and the gags here rival their best material.  As you'll hear loads of times if you peruse the DVD extras, Irving Thalberg encouraged the Brothers to take their material on the road for testing in front of an audience before filming it.  Hence, the timing, the punch lines and the individual words themselves are all finely honed.  It's this attention to detail that makes them work.  You could easily imagine the ""Tootsie Frootsie"" sequence dragging and dying if the lines hadn't been performed perfectly.
The bad guys in this one are a lot of fun too, and go a long way towards making this such a success.  Sig Ruman is welcomed back after OPERA, and it's great to see him eye-popping in shock whenever insulted by Groucho.  By the end of his segment, his voice has risen so high in outrage that he sounds like Dr. Strangelove.  Similarly, the fake telephone call from Florida wouldn't be as funny as it is without Leonard Ceeley's wonderful over the top frustration.
As a modern movie viewer, I couldn't help but be amused by a scene, which, if DAY had come later, would have been seen as a parody of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  In one of that science fiction epic's more famous sequences, Johann Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" plays majestically in the background as a space station slowly spins in orbit, ready to engage in docking procedures.  Here, the same piece of classical music plays while we see Groucho Marx in a dressing grown, slowly spinning and dancing in front of a mirror, as he eagerly awaits engaging in docking procedures with the beautiful Esther Muir.  Well, I was amused anyway.
One more thing I should mention about the film: the song and dance sequence in the poor, black community.  Now, compared to other films of that time, this is almost progressive in its attitude towards race (which, admittedly, isn't saying much).  But there is one thing that makes me a little uncomfortable.  In context, it almost appears to be saying that, yes, the blacks are poor, and yes, they're outcasts from white society, but, well, they've got their singing and dancing, and, gosh, aren't they happy, and doesn't that make it all okay?  I can't help but think that's the subtle message, though perhaps it's just me.  Still, I shouldn't complain too much, because it is by far the best singing and dancing in the entire film (though I'll grudgingly admit the ballerina was also quite skilled).  Imagine, people actually having fun with song and dance!  It's certainly a change from the stoic, restrained and boring performances elsewhere.
The DVD comes with several extras, so you really get your money's worth, even if you aren't quite thrilled with all of the offerings.  The documentary is based upon the same structure as on the DVD of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, which means there's valuable trivia and knowledge from the lips of all manner of comedians, co-stars, and writers, and also Dom DeLuise talking about food.  I'll bet I'm not the only one surprised and delighted that both the female romantic leads from NIGHT and DAY are still alive and sharp enough to recall details from almost seventy years ago.
The commentary track is relatively good when fan Glenn Mitchell is actually speaking, but there's an unfortunate amount of dead air.  At least he's honest though; he recommends viewers take advantage of the chapter-forward button to skip through the interminable ballet sequence since he's decided it's not any good and he has nothing to say until the next scene.  Some of the trivia he imparts is interesting, but he has an unfortunate habit of pointing out continuity errors and things that most the audience won't care about.  Still, he said some stuff I didn't know (the song ""A Message From The Man In The Moon"" that Groucho sings a snatch of at the closing was intended to be the movie's big song, but was cut), which is always appreciated.
You can skip over the rest of the DVD extras.  Robert Benchley had an Oscar winning short on the NIGHT release, but A NIGHT AT THE MOVIES is rather predictable and dull.  Also included are three vintage cartoons, which are quite clearly from a different age.  And they're welcome to them.
I'm not sure whether I'd place this film or DUCK SOUP as my all-time favorite Marx Brothers flick.  But honestly, who cares which one is the best?  This film is available separately or as part of the recent ""Marx Brothers Collection"" DVD box set.  If you're going to buy only one of those films (and why not just buy the set?), then I'd recommend this one above all.",1085702400,6,5693,4.756866734486267
384111,4,6301965965,"The big all-black except Harpo production number included a song that I don't know the name of (All god chillun got swing?) which was recorded (either before or after the movie, I just recognized it) by a young Judy Garland.  Did Gus Kahn write the words for that too?  I thought the flick was watery and patchy (like all their movies after the big 4, I always exclude Duck Soup, bullheaded? because it was scripted by Kalmar and Ruby, 2 of their songwriters?), but it had some great lines and some reasonably though compared to their first 4 flicks only moderately funny routines in it.  Harpo got knocked about once, but it was brief and early in the flick and he more than compensated by kicking the villain in the ass!  There was chaos, there was pandemonioun and there was shtick, but (sigh) while funny it wasn't up (down, in golf a low score is better) to par.  But.  This was only in the first part of the movie.

And really picked up when our hero made up with his girl, Harpo (later joined by Groucho and Chico) danced with the black people, followed by the plot complications and the funny horserace and ending in triumph.

I prefer the Marx Bros movies where there are no villains.  A long review that mentions no rountine, I'll leave that to the devotees who revel and delight in the Marx Bros more than I do to point out and rhapsodize over.

I have it and have seen it about a dozen times over the years and I still laugh, one thing I like about the Marx Brothers is that you can see the same movie 10 times and each time you see it you catch something new that you didn't notice before. It has great writing and excellent acting. They musical talent is wonderful, I love the scene where Harpo play the piano with the orchestra. Definitely a must have.",1007164800,,582,4.252252252252252
384248,5,6301965965,"""A Day At the Races"", the Marx Bros. seventh film, released in 1937, is their last real great film in the sense of its overall humor and comic genous.
Groucho plays a horse doctor, Dr. Hackenbush, who is more interested on betting on horses than treating them.
The plot revolves around a sanatorium which is loosing money.  Run by Judy Standish (Maureen O'Sullivan), she is offered five thousand dollars to sell it to a shady character, Morgan (Douglas Dumbrille).  He wants the sanitorium for his race track.  However, the sanitorium's leading patient, Mrs. UpJohn (Margaret Dumont) comes to the aid of Judy Standish when she offers finicial support - but only if she hires Dr. Hackenbush.  Of course nobody knows he is just a horse doctor.
Harpo plays a jockey.  Chico (Tony) plays the sanitarium's loyal employee.  When he overhears the conversation about Hackensbush, he quickly wires him to come.  He also sells ice cream and racing tips on the side.  In a later scene, one of the film's highlights, he sells Groucho a library's worth of books which are intended to have the name of the horse and jockey in a particular race.
As is many Marx Bros. films, there is a love interest.  This one involves Allan Jones (Gil Stewart) and Judy Standish.  He spends his life's savings on a horse, Highhat, in the hopes it will win a race and enough money to bail the sanatorium out of its near bankruptcy.
Over-all, this is a fast paced comedy, expect for the songs which really have no place in the film, and seem to go on forever.  However, they may be fast forwarded through.
The film's highlights include a roarous scene with the Marx Bros. and a seductress, Flo Marlowe (Esther Muir).  Morgan uses her to seduce Groucho, and have Dumont come in on the act, knowing she would quickly dispense of his services, and the sanatoruim would be his.  However, Hapro and Chico, through a series of hilarious events, foil the plan.
Another highlight comes when Sig Ruman, playing Dr. Leopold Steinburg, comes to examine Dumont and prove there is nothing really the matter with her.  The Marx Bros. have another of their field days.
The climax comes when Highhat is entered in a race, and Morgan tries everything he can to keep him out of it.  The Marx Bros. see to it that Highhat remains in the race, at any cost.
""A Day At the Races"" contains enough comic humor and classic Marx Bros. material to be considered a great film, and still stands the test of time as a Marx Bros. classic.",1002499200,10,2475,4.631578947368421
384249,5,6301965965,"One of the funniest films made by the Marx Brothers after the departure of the fourth brother, Zeppo.  The scene with Chico and Groucho at the windows where Chico sells Groucho all those books is considered one of the best (if not the best) skits ever done in their films.  Also, two of the best musical performances by Chico and Harpo are included here.  Although their films were made years ago, their brand of slapstick comedy has always remained entertaining with each passing generation.",983750400,4,492,4.833333333333333

384251,5,6301965965,"This is definitely my favorite Marx Bros. film; one of the funniest I've seen!  Their unique, timeless humor is eminent throughout the entire movie.  When the sanitarium is in danger of going bankrupt, Dr. Hackenfuss is  called in to save it.  After that, it's literally just one hilarious scene  after another:  Groucho being gulled into buying books on what horse to bet  on; Harpo getting a check-up; Groucho's infamous snappy comebacks to  everything, etc.  It also has some lovely song and dance numbers.  This is  an undoubtedly wonderful film!",944006400,3,550,5.067415730337078
7817631,5,6301965965,"About 10 years ago, my late grandfather gave me VHS tapes of Abbott and Costello in ""the Naughty Nineties"" and The Marx Brothers in ""A Day At the Races"". He knew I liked classic comedy films and I still do to this day. A Day At the Races is another Marx Brothers comedy classic where Groucho plays a veterinarian who is hired to take care of a sick woman who thinks he's an actual doctor who treats people while Harpo plays an out of work jockey and Chico's sidekick and Chico plays between an orderly at sanitarium and good-hearted con-man. Together with handsome lounge singer, they try to raise money for the owner of the sanitarium who is facing financial struggles from a crooked hotel and casino owner and their only hope is to win at the racetrack with a horse. Full of non-stop laughs and a few catchy musical numbers, fun for the whole family to watch.",1522368000,,861,4.455696202531645
