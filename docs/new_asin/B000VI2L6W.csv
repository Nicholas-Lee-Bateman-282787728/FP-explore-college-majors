8218741,4,B000VI2L6W,"Heidi Tanner leads this 50 minute cardio workout which is quite challenging in some spots.  You will see a wide assortment of cardio here, low impact, higher impact, tall box cardio, and even some kickboxing and dance segments.  You will need a light set of weights, a tall step and lots of energy.

While I enjoyed the workout, I found it to be a little long, so I simply skipped some of the segments.  There is one segment where you do handstands, which do not appear to be overly difficult.  I simply don't trust myself in attempting this move so I bypass it, knowing me I would land on my head or something.  So I just steer clear, the chaptering of the DVD makes it very simple to do this.

The music is great, and Heidi really shines in this workout.  I especially liked the salsa segment near the end, probably my favorite.  I tend to prefer weights over cardio, and longer cardio workouts tend to really drag for me.  Not the case for this one, I really enjoyed it.

Overall I give this workout 4 and a half stars.",1451692800,,1022,4.326315789473684
8218742,5,B000VI2L6W,"This workout is TOUGH!! It is very much like the old Firm workouts from the 80's and 90's.  It is much harder than the Fitprime series.  You can add weights to both the FItprime and this series to make the workouts even tougher.  I just did the old firm cross trainers Firm Strength and Firm Cardio and this workout was just as tough if not tougher.  I love the Kickbutt Series from Anna Benson.....Updated music, a beautiful, modern set and the old Firm workouts that get massive results!",1371168000,,489,4.5227272727272725
8218743,5,B000VI2L6W,"If you're a fan of the classic Firm workout from the 80s and early 90s, then you'll love this workout.  Anna Benson sold The Firm and then started making these videos.  She uses weights and a 14"" box but you don't have to use one that tall if you don't have it.  Any step of any brand can work as I have the original Reebok step with three levels which works fine.  I use a broom stick as my dow and it works great.  The workout is paced so that you're not killing yourself or taking a chance of injuring or pulling muscles.  You can use whatever weight you want or use none at all but I do feel the step is important although it could be done without one.  You can see and feel results in 3-4 workouts.  I believe they advertise 6-10 but if you're faithful to this workout along with other Firm or FitPrime videos, you'll see results faster than anything else on the market.  I'm 53 years old and although there's times I have to stop for a minute, I can do this workout without any problems but you will need to make sure you're using proper form.  The instructor is great and although the music may not be the best, it doesn't bother me as I want to see and feel results without feeling like I'm dying afterwards.  I do use Jillian Michaels Last Chance Workout, Pheadra's Phine Body Workout along with Karen Voight' DVDs in rotation with The Firm Classic and FitPrime and Kick Butt DVDS.  I rarely ever do the same workout 2 days in a row as I feel you need to trick your body into getting the results you want.",1364342400,2,1514,4.200692041522491
