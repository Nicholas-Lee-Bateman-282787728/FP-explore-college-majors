But then all too many find subtitles off-putting monetheless I just watched with Italian actually spoken and German subtitles.  For what I missed in the too fast Italian I could sorta pick up from the German - what a marketing idiocy !!
What a great Box set it would make to put all 14 of the Sophia and Mastroianni films together - I'm still missing three....All in Italian of course with as many subtitles as ""marketing managers"" judged ""marketable"".....",1464998400,,679,4.603305785123967
