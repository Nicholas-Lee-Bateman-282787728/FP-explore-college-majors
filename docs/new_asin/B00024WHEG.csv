8155476,5,B00024WHEG,I used this video (VHS) extensively as an intro to Theatre in my Theatre I classes throughout a thirty-five year teaching career. The program consists of two parts; ORIGIN OF THE DRAMA and ORIGIN OF THE THEATER. The first covers the works and playwrights; mostly early Greeks. The second part deals with the physical theater and some of the terminology. A great resource for Theatre teachers looking for a good primer for beginning students.,1188432000,4,441,4.972972972972973
