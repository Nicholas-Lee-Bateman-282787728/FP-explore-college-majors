3763160,5,B001Q98Y8O,"I have watched this concert a couple of times and have come to the conclusion that it is the best Stevie Nicks Concert on video.  Stevie looked and performed great and of course she is joined by Waddy Wachtel.  Stevie tells a little story between each song which gives it a personal touch.

I have the Blu-ray version of this concert and wanted to mention it is in wide screen format, though It doesn't say if the ratio is 1.85:1 or 1.78:1.  The video quality is top notch.

The play list is:
Stand Back
Enchanted
If Anyone Falls
Rhiannon
Crash Into Me
Sorcerer
The One
Gold Dust Woman
I Need To Know
Circle Dance
Landslide
Sara
Fall from Grace
How Still My Love
Edge of Seventeen
Rock and Roll

Enjoy,

3763161,4,B001Q98Y8O,"Sound Stage DVDs are top notch production wise...and this is no exception. My only wish was  that Stevie would have given us a few  more  ""Classic"" tunes  and that would have pushed  this easily up to 5 stars. I guess she wanted to keep her ""Mac"" tunes  for the most  part separate..but with only a few exceptions..her solo work isn't at  the same level in my opinion. If you are a Stevie fan..you'll love  it..and I'm  happy to have it...but would have found a few more ""mac"" tunes to be a nice silver lining.",1242518400,7,510,4.329787234042553
3763162,5,B001Q98Y8O,It's an another fantastic performance from Stevie Nicks. She's performed like a 20 years ago.,1242518400,4,93,5.266666666666667
3763163,5,B001Q98Y8O,"I recently purchased this dvd on bluray disc after its release date was delayed at least 2 times in the last year.
Before I watched it, I had memories of people telling me about past concerts and live stuff of Stevie that they had viewed & how she looked drugged up, slow, &  how the performance was lacking something.

I am happy to say that this dvd was nothing like their memories of the past...
It is incredible... the sound, picture, crowd & camera views are perfect!

Stevie looks incredible up on stage... she looks vibrant, young, beautiful, and her voice is the same as it always was!!!

She does some light dancing/moving around, & shows happiness!!!

Please buy this DVD... You will enjoy watching it over and over!!!
thanks...",1240531200,11,738,4.6461538461538465
3763164,5,B001Q98Y8O,I bought this Blu-ray concert for my girlfriend for valentines day and of course being a big fan of Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks I watched it with her.  I am 57 years old and Stevie is at least my age or a few years older and I was amazed at how well she sounded.  She is still a fox and I was totally impressed by this performance.  This is a recent performance 2006-7. We watched this with the 5.1 uncompressed multi-channel audio. (No DTS-Master Audio) Excellent video and audio.  Very tight band with one of the best guitar players around today Waddy Wachtel (He has played with the best of them). If you like the music of Stevie Nicks - this is a must have Blu-ray DVD.... Well done Soundstage.,1234656000,26,701,4.32824427480916
3763165,1,B001Q98Y8O,"The jacket is wrinkled as if it were once wet. Some letters are written on the label side of the disc with a magic marker. I would not say this item is in a ""very good"" condition.",1360281600,,179,3.864864864864865
3763166,1,B001Q98Y8O,"$76.08???  Seriously???  I love Ms. Nicks... but $76.08???  I couldn't possibly afford it.

Just who is being so greedy here?",1358726400,,125,5.1
3763167,5,B001Q98Y8O,"Very Impressive! Stevie Nicks looks and sounds incredible! This BR is actually only 1080i but the pic quality is still excellent. Sound Quality (especially the uncompressed format) is excellent. If you're a Stevie Nicks fan, this is a must own.",1346630400,,244,5.125
3763168,5,B001Q98Y8O,I hit the 5.1 uncompressed under setup and couldn't believe just how good this sounds. The picture quality is just as great. A must buy!,1330128000,,136,4.48
3763169,4,B001Q98Y8O,"She looks great, she sounds great.  It's not like a really live concert, though, as it was filmed on a soundstage in Chicago, and appears to have been edited.  But that's not anything against Stevie or her abilities!",1323216000,,216,4.657894736842105
3763170,5,B001Q98Y8O,"So very impressive seeing Stevie Nick sing like she did many years ago live. Uncanny voice, more like an angel then anything else. Well done show, great stage back drop and lighting, perfection in music playing and of course Stevie at her best. Well worth it, BD makes it so much better but really the content is tops.",1283126400,2,318,4.5
3763171,5,B001Q98Y8O,"This is one awesome blu-ray concert.  The quality of the transfer is one of the BEST I've seen - both visually and aurally.  And Stevie Nicks sound AND looks absolutely FANTASTIC.

All I can really say is if you are a fan and you have a blu-ray player this is a TOTAL NO-BRAINER ... buy it NOW while you can still find it.  And, thank me later.",1280361600,4,344,4.08955223880597
3763172,5,B001Q98Y8O,With this concert Stevie shows us why she is the Queen of Rock. Female artist today need to take notes. This is how you stay on top for so long. If I could only have one concert on Blu-ray this would be the one. The sound is incredible and the picture quality even better.,1271548800,4,272,4.055555555555555

3763174,3,B001Q98Y8O,"Overrated. Mostly her own song-writings, with nothing truly standing out, or comparable to Fleetwood Mac songs.",1269648000,,111,6.0
8335254,5,B001Q98Y8O,Another great performance by Stevie Nicks on bluray ! Good deal on this item.,1514505600,,77,4.571428571428571
8335255,1,B001Q98Y8O,"Don't know how many people gonna read this but as a fan of SN, I hate this BR, I got this primarily for the surround, and for that, truly lackadaisical. The performance, what performance? SN if you notice lately looks decidedly old and I mean performance wise, is to be expected, is not her fault, everybody gets old and slow down, but you got to know when to call it quits, and this session was produced 8 years ago. The set, if you can call it that, looks like something put up at the last minute, even a b&w Beetle performance from the 60's got more pizazz and energy than this one.  Guess I will have to make do replaying superb SN at the Red Rocks (1989) even though it's only stereo.",1487462400,,689,4.21969696969697
8335256,5,B001Q98Y8O,Great sound and picture. Definitely a keepsake performance by Stevie.,1480291200,,69,6.0

8335260,5,B001Q98Y8O,"Great gig  of wonderful Stevie Nicks, time pass but her class is always the same. The audio tracks are very good (especially 5.1 uncompressed) and video quality is almost stunning. I know that see her live in my country is practically  impossible so i consider myself lucky to enjoy her on video at least. Highly recommended.",1424822400,,325,4.785714285714286
8335261,4,B001Q98Y8O,Good product of great seller..I would buy again from these people. Come to the happy club! And be happy for the rest of your life! Hope i can handle the excitement for this product an othe 65 years,1398556800,,197,4.2105263157894735
8335262,4,B001Q98Y8O,"I've compared the blu-ray to the DVD.  The Blu-ray has WAY better video and audio than the DVD.  This is the same show as the Live In Chicago DVD, so worse case that could be a filler if you can't get the blu-ray, but as I said the video and the audio are MUCH better. So get it while you can.
Essential if your a big Stevie Nicks fan.  FWIW",1381276800,,341,3.842857142857143
8335263,5,B001Q98Y8O,"This blu-ray concert is a must-own for Stevie Nicks fans. The quality of both the performance, the picture and the audio are all top-notch. Love her cover of 'Crash Into Me.' Find it while you can because it seems to be out of print now.",1373155200,,237,4.288888888888889
