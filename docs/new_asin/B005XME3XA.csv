4903318,4,B005XME3XA,"I will skip the product information since other reviews and the amazon.com description dive into those details.

I used to be a huge fan of Cathe's workouts until about 2009. My joints could just no longer handle the impact of the cardio and the heavy lifting. I became interested again once I heard about the Low Impact Series. This is the first workout in the series that I have tried. I have to say that this is unlike anything else in Cathe's collection and it is well worth the money!

There are plenty of balance challenges, sweat inducing lower body movements, joint-friendly modifications, modification descriptions for those of us that are not at the advanced level, and plenty of premixes for any schedule. Since I am just starting out again after pregnancy I did most of the lower body without weights and I was still sweaty and shaking! Within moments of completing the Total Body Express Premix this evening my legs were weak and my upper body was throbbing. I love all of the work on the stability ball and the row/plank combos.

The only cons I have about this workout are the transitions for the core work for both the full length workout and the premixes. Because you work in a triset core comes at the end each grouping so you are going from floor to standing, quickly. I have knee problems so there was some issue for me. I would also say that the music isn't bad, others on some websites complained about it. I hardly noticed it. It would only be a problem if you needed the music to either keep beat or motivation.

I'm excited for the first time to be using her workouts again! I feel well worked but was able to modify to my level easily. After having my baby, my core and lower back have been so weak. These workouts allow me to train those problem areas from various angles and you don't need heavy weights to get great DOMS. Even with knee issues I was able to do the cup exercises without pain and I used my Step360 for the step ups for additional balance work. Because of this workout I cannot wait to get several other of the LIS workouts and try her newest series: XTrain",1357430400,8,2101,4.44935064935065
4903319,5,B005XME3XA,"I do the upper body segments more (on days after running or harder cardio).  This is one of the few workouts I've done which really works the lats/upper back.  The chest/shoulders/triceps and back/biceps/core premixes take almost an hour when combined, but it really flies by.  It moves quickly, not too fast, but enough so you don't get bored.  I would definitely recommend this!",1357257600,11,380,4.984126984126984
4903320,5,B005XME3XA,These tri-sets are a great workout.  I love working onthe ball and the lower body is a great way to burn calories.  You go Cathe.  I will definteliy buy moreof her workouts.,1356652800,,173,4.34375
4903321,4,B005XME3XA,I didn't read the title carefully because I thought this was a cardio video.  It is a strength training video.  I'm OK with that.  It wasn't too too challenging  but it was pretty good.,1356393600,2,185,4.352941176470588
4903322,5,B005XME3XA,"Having never done any workout tapes before, I bought Cathe's Total Body Tri-Sets and Cardio Super-Sets. I really enjoy them. She keeps your heart rate up and you feel great when you're done. Not difficult to learn either. This tape requires dumbbells, a stability ball, and steps. I don't have steps, I skip that part, and it's still a good workout. I'd say it's great for beginners.",1326326400,2,383,4.731343283582089
4903323,5,B005XME3XA,"This versatile DVD is part of Cathe's Low Impact Series.  The focus here is more on strength training, unlike most of the other DVDs in this series, which are cardio-focused.  That being said, your heart rate will be elevated since you're moving quickly from one exercise to the next.  I would categorize these workouts as more metabolic training than pure strength workouts.

There is an upper body workout(60 minutes) and a Lower Body Workout(40 minutes), plus various premixes.

UPPER BODY

Here you also do 3 sets of exercises, one for each body part.  The workout it split between sets for chest, shoulders and triceps and sets for back, biceps and core.  This is also one tough workout!  I couldn't come close to matching Cathe on the weights, even though I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser.  Oh well, it's something to work towards.

What I enjoyed about this workout:

**It's tough!  My heart rate was up there for the entire workout.

**The unique exercises.  Even though I normally don't like pushups, I enjoyed the one foot cross-over pushups.  Of course, I didn't look very elegant doing these, but they were fun.

Some things to note about this workout:

**The `screaming guitar' music may not be for everyone.  I kind of liked it because it reminded me of the music in the Beachbody P90X and P90X2 workouts.  I love P90X and am always inspired to give it my all.  I felt the same with these workouts.

**Cathe spends an inordinate amount of time talking about form.  This is a good thing, but she's doing it just as we have picked up a heavy weight, in preparation for the next exercise.  Perhaps she does this on purpose, so we can build up endurance.  I just found it annoying and usually started the exercise.

LOWER BODY

You do three rounds of exercises.  Each round is 3 different exercises, done two times through.  Even though this workout is only 40 minutes, it's tough!

What I loved about Lower Body:

**The unique and fun exercises.  There are lunges with Dixie cups (picking them up and placing them down).  My favorite is the one-legged cross lunges, where you're standing on one leg, holding 2 dumb bells and alternatively putting down and picking up the dumb bells.  I quickly discovered that my balance is not as good as I thought it was.

**The compound exercises that also get your heart rate up.  The static lunges with the Dixie cups are one such example.

**I felt energized and really worked out after finishing, but I wasn't exhausted.

I prefer to do heavy weight training using splits, e.g. I like doing only one or two body parts per day.  That way I can lift really heavy.  I'm not sure how this DVD will fit into my rotations, but I still enjoyed it.  There are premixes for these types of splits too.

If you're looking for a fun and versatile workout, you may enjoy this one.",1325030400,17,2831,4.613682092555332
4903324,5,B005XME3XA,"It is a good workout, consists of two repetitions of circuits of three exercises, and then you move on to a next circuit. There are different premixes which is excellent, and the workout is sufficiently challenging. Not one of my most favorite ones (that would be High Reps, Butts&guts and Slow&Heavy series), but still an excellent workout.",1321315200,9,341,5.0
4903325,5,B005XME3XA,"I am addicted Cathe's workouts.  She will whip you into fantastic shape!  I do all of her heavy weighted workouts, so I was a tad skeptical of the lower body portion of this workout.  I mean really, bending down and picking up dixie cups as a workout?!  YUP!!  It will kick your butt!  I can hardly move one day later!  My hamstrings are so sore!  After completing the upper body portion I felt like I was in a car accident! lol!  Most of the upper body is done while on the ball.  What a challenge that is!  I have nothing bad to say about this workout. I workout with weights on a regular basis, so for me to have that soreness in new places is awesome!  Well worth adding to your collection!",1320969600,17,694,4.174242424242424
4903326,5,B005XME3XA,"When I started this series, I was like, ""Really, Dixie cups?"" Holy smokes, I hurt two days afterwards! This video will still kick your arse.  As I noted in another review, low impact does not equal low intensity. Cathe was right when she said in her video, you will never look at Dixie cups the same way!",1424736000,4,304,4.333333333333333
4903327,5,B005XME3XA,"I do only Cathe Friedrich exercise tapes.  I have been doing them for years.....and I thought I was in tip top shape until I did this Tri-set tape.  It made me ""good"" sore in all the right places and let me know I still have work to do!!",1420329600,4,237,3.9166666666666665

4903330,5,B005XME3XA,All her workouts do not disappoint. Be prepared to put out effort. She will not waste your time. Love her!,1402272000,,106,4.35
4903331,4,B005XME3XA,"Didn't like the dumb cups, used weights instead.  This DVD was returned.  I am not a beginner nor am I advanced in my workouts, however this was a little to easy for me.  I did add weights where she used none and increased my weights in some parts to make it harder and it did give me a good workout.  I really just didn't care for the cardio mixed with weights workout.  The reason why I started doing Cathe video's is because the DVD my mother let me used was straight weights which I love.  This is a combination of cardio and weights, so if you like that than this would be a good video for you.

Update 5-13-15
I repurchased this DVD for one simple reason, Cathe ran out of all over strength training videos :( however, I will say I updated my stars to 4 instead of 3 because you can easliy make this video harder by adding heavier weights, LOW IMPACT NO MORE!  The only thing I really don't like and it's a personal preference is that she incorporates cardio with weights a little more in this video than others.  This def is not a favorite because of that reason.  When I am doing weights I want to do just weights.  But like I said it's a personal preference.  All in all it served it's purpose.",1395964800,3,1203,4.205240174672489
4903332,5,B005XME3XA,"This has something for all schedules - I don't always have a ton of time, but want to work out.  This has such a great variety of work outs - I can almost always fit something in to my schedule. Also, I have knee problems and this workout still gives me the feeling that I got a good workout in without hurting myself.",1388102400,,318,4.0476190476190474
4903333,5,B005XME3XA,"Never underestimate how Cathe will challenge you with almost any routine. This is just as tough as her high-impact, except she works different muscles. I always look for variety in workouts to prevent boredom and muscle overwork. Cathe always provides ingenuity and challenge.",1380844800,2,276,5.441860465116279
4903334,4,B005XME3XA,Kathy really takes low impact into a high result zone! I love her routines and how I break a sweat with the challenging moves. I don't have the sliders but do alternative moves when she uses them.  I don't miss a beat!,1374192000,,218,4.190476190476191
4903335,3,B005XME3XA,"I'm a Cathe fan. Overall, it's a solid workout. What I don't like about it is that the pre-mixes (to get a total body workout vs. doing just upper body or just lower body) jump around from one set to the next, so it's quite choppy. Also, she spends quite a bit of time explaining modifications or how to do the exercise or what to do with the ball. I prefer this to be in an Intro section because while it's fine the first few times you do the dvd, it quickly becomes tiresome and interrupts the flow of the workout.  The workout could be 10 minutes shorter if you could cut out those parts, and for a weekday workout that's valuable time. Also, I am not a big fan of electric guitar music for working out. Good workout but not one I'll readily reach for.",1363219200,14,755,4.171232876712328
8488730,2,B005XME3XA,"Meh. I ended up getting rid of this one. It's a decent workout, but I don't feel that it is strenuous. Of course I can always make it harder by using heavier weights, but there are other things I don't love about it and other weight training discs (even from Cathe) that I like better. The music is pretty terrible and the pacing is slow. There is a lot of time between the exercises in the tri-set in my opinion so I find that I just don't enjoy it. Since I never reach for it, I decided to move it on.

As always, the best parts are the premix options, the production value, and the encouraging but low-key Cathe & crew. Good workout for someone looking for a non-cardio weight disc. Just not for me.",1522108800,,702,4.2

8488732,1,B005XME3XA,"I have only done the upper body portion so far, but I HATED it. There's tons of work on the ball, which is super fiddly and annoying to work with. The lifting pace is too fast, I could barely keep up with her at all. I don't feel like I even got a good workout, there is no burn after this workout, barely broke a sweat. I like her other stuff, but definitely not this one.",1504569600,,373,3.9210526315789473
8488733,5,B005XME3XA,Cathe is one of my favorites!  Love her workouts - she will push you to get the results!  Well worth it but be prepared to work!  And always to fun music too!,1484352000,,158,3.875

8488736,5,B005XME3XA,This is a GREAT dvd!! I especially like the lower body workout portion. This not only works the legs but is also a very good glute workout.,1431216000,,139,4.185185185185185
8488737,5,B005XME3XA,This is a difficult workout! I end up sore after doing even the short premixes. Awesome!,1430956800,,88,4.5625
8488738,4,B005XME3XA,"This is one of my favorite weight lifting workouts.  It is quick and effective when I'm short on time.

This lower body workout is fantastic for the glutes, at lease for me.  I noticed a big change in by backside and so did my husband.  I think it is a combination of the forward leaning movements and the way she stacks this workout.

I LOVE the fact that for the upper body I can split chest, shoulders, and triceps for one day and back and biceps for the other, both in under 30 minutes.  This gives me the option to add in some cardio and get a great overall workout!!!

This would be 5 star workout if it wasn't for the music and a couple of lengthy explanations, but it is one great DVD that I use a lot.  I think part of the extra instruction is to let people take a small break.  This is a long workout if you don't break it into segments and sometimes you need more time to recover if you are doing the whole thing at one time.

I select not to listed to her music and play my own when doing this workout.  This is the only DVD of Cathe's I do that with.  It just isn't good music.  But you can select voice only under audio settings on all her dvds, which is one reason I love Cathe's products so much.

Just look at the premixes and you will see that you can do the whole workout at once or do all upper body in under an hour, or split the upper body into two different workouts.  The lower body workout is about 45 minutes, and that's very good for as effective as it is in my opinion.  The lower body workout has a JFO option, which means joint friendly. It removes the one leg cross over dip squats and puts in reverse lunges instead.",1429142400,3,1648,4.055727554179566
