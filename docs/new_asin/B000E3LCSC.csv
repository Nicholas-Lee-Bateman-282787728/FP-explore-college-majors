8105532,5,B000E3LCSC,"I have always liked Fernando Bujones, one of the finest dancers ever. The whole performance was on stage and very intimate. The  company was fabulous, great costumes and sets! I do recommend it highly to anyone who likes classical performances, especially for young girls that are dancing.",1366243200,3,289,5.148936170212766
8105533,1,B000E3LCSC,"I have seen many versions of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" ballet, and by far, this is the worst production I have ever seen. This is my favorite ballet, and the see even the mighty Maleficent reduced to a woman in a black leotard and what I can only guess to be a chiffon skirt broke my heart. While Mr. Bujones is amazing, it does not make up for the rest of this sad production.",1266105600,2,373,4.123287671232877
8105534,4,B000E3LCSC,"This may not be a first rate performance in terms of comparison with World Class companies, but it provides a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
Bujones, takes the stage with the authority of a Master but the work of the Prima Ballerina, is equal to the demands of the production as is the dancing of the remainder of the cast drawn from the ranks of the Ballet del teatro Municipal of Chile, the hosts for the production.
For those who will buy only the very best this may be flawed; however, for those who have a desire to see what is being done in the rest of the world, there will be no disappointment in purchasing and viewing this DVD.",1224892800,4,639,4.423728813559322
8105535,3,B000E3LCSC,"I don't want to knock Santiago's Municipal Theatre Ballet, but they would never be mistaken for a world-class outfit.  If you're willing to be charmed by a production that overall displays considerably more enthusiasm than discipline or technique -- even the orchestra usually sounds more like a marching-band -- this can be an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours (total time 107 minutes).  Several of the soloists do a very creditable job, and enthusiasts of Fernando Bujones -- who turns in a strong and supportive performance here -- will want this for their collections, but others may prefer to look elsewhere.",1156550400,8,620,5.009708737864078
8105536,5,B000E3LCSC,"This is one of the finest Sleeping Beauties on dvd.  It has been out for quite a while on vhs and has just come out on dvd.  Fernando Bujones was one of the finest dancers of the late 20th century and to see him perform his own choreography in his solos here is breathtaking!  His Princess Aurore is played by Maryse Egasse.  She puts in a fine performance also, but I find her style a bit too soft, lacking crispness and definition, but it still works for her.  The other fairy soloists were more to my liking and even Carabosse, played by Elba Rey, is danced on pointe beautifully.  The Bluebird variation is also fantastic.  Unlike the companion dvd of Coppelia, released at the same time(see my review of it), the sound and image quality here are very good, as is the camera work.  This is very close to the top of my list of Sleeping Beauties.  Its release coincides with the untimely death of Fernando Bujones and the ballet community, his friends, and his family will miss him dearly.  This dvd is a great remembrance.",1144972800,8,1025,4.462365591397849
