8675945,1,B00N37QD6C,You can do a whole lot better. Many of the techniques in here are unrealistic and will not work. The material and footage seem dated yet they claim 2014. This was another out of 3 dvd's I made the mistake of buying by Franco in 2015. This one was almost as bad as the widowmaker.,1483574400,,279,4.090909090909091
8675946,1,B00N37QD6C,These dvd are low-budget it comes in a DVD- R and it does not work correctly.,1452124800,,77,3.875

8675948,5,B00N37QD6C,"It contains very good information,a different perspective and some sound stratages ,no super secret martial arts moves if that's what your looking for ....keep looking.
But worth your time,might change your mindset.",1434758400,,215,5.75
8675949,5,B00N37QD6C,"I own a whole bunch of CFA DVDs, but this one is my favorite. If you're involved in a street fight, you should be ready for, in fact expect, to fight multiple opponents. However, most martial arts spend little to no time on this subject. Sammy teaches you how to identify the alpha attacker (and why this is important), staggered vs. parallel encroachments, why you should avoid clinching, and much more. My favorite part of the DVD was learning what I believe was called the ""assembly line"" technique. This is a great DVD.",1415232000,3,523,4.634408602150538
8675950,5,B00N37QD6C,Sammy franco is a very good instructor. Easy to follow. Always buy for my partner who is a security guard and he raves about it. He wants the whole series!!! He used techniques from this DVD recently in a real life situation he was in at work. The techniques he learned stop him being seriously injured,1415145600,2,302,4.410714285714286
