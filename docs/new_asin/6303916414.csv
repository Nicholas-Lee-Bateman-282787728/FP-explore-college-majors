736368,3,6303916414,"I've always enjoy Gerard. But I've just finished watching this movie. Can someone please tell me what happened? I don't think Onoff actually killed anyone. There was no murder. There was no body. The sack that was been  pulled from the van was full of Onoff's possessions. Also, I suspect that  the police station is no police station at all. Can anyone  help/confirm/clear-this-up for me ??
Thanks very much. Peter",929318400,2,415,4.9

The only down side is trying to find a decent copy of the film. There are no region 1 DVD's I could find, and the Amazon Instant video is terrible. It looks like it was taken from a VHS tape. The video area is actually smaller then your monitor/tv, so with the already poor video quality, you'll have a hell of a time trying to read the subtitles. Maybe try Youtube?

As far as Polanski's performance goes, is one of his best performances right next to The Tenant. The script follows the ancient philosophical storytelling of perhaps that of The Faust genre and the outcome is golden once again. Typically I usually cannot sit for more than 10 minutes of the film that takes place 90% of the time in one room using only two characters. There are only a handful of films that I feel could tackle this sort of small production and do it perfect. Very suspenseful, very well written and worth the money and time.

736535,2,6303916414,"I watched this with some fascination waiting for something to happened. Nothing did. Since it stars Roman Polanski and Gerard Depardieu I stayed with it until the very end. The ending is a bit of a surprise. At first I didn't realize what had happened, but my subconscious mind worked on it and at three o'clock in the morning I woke up and realized what had happened. Consequently much of the mystery and confusion (in my mind) about the film was cleared up.

However my guess is that ""Une pura formalita"" will be for most viewers a very boring movie. Typical of many French films it is full of talk, talk and more talk like a Romer flick. Only difference is there is no sex and no female characters. In a way it's a guy kind of film like a war movie but without the action.

Polanski plays a police inspector. Call him Leonardo. Depardieu plays Onoff a famous writer who is suspected of murder. Polanski interrogates Depardieu. That's ninety percent of the film. There are some flashed-backed, indistinct scenes and some other police persons, in particular a young policeman pounding an old manual typewriter as the two leads talk. That's about it. Depardieu's character can't remember things. Polanski's character who, as it happens, is a big fan of Onoff nonetheless suspects that Onoff is lying.

There's a storm and a blackout and incessant rain. The old country police station leaks. Candles all about in the semi-darkness. Water drips down into bowls and cups. Still nothing happens. Finally we have the surprise ending. I say ""surprise ending"" rather than ""trick ending"" because it was foreshadowed and I should have seen it coming.

Direction was interesting too--the frenetic panting and running through the initially beautiful, still night contrasted with the sterile, seemingly calm, interior of a police station.

736654,5,6303916414,"'A Pure Formality' was, to my surprise, one of the very best films I've seen in a long time. I'd seen snippets of the Italian version on Italian TV and the English-language one on US cable, neither encouraging me to delve further, but in its original French, with both Polanski and Depardieu voicing themselves, it manages to turn a potentially hoary old psychodrama into something much more life affirming.

Depardieu is the confused great writer arrested in the middle of a rainstorm and taken to a dark, leaking Italian police station where he is interrogated by Roman Polanski's inspector, who also happens to be an ardent fan, over the identity of a murder victim. Naturally, layers of self-deception are gradually pulled away on this long dark night of the soul before it reaches a not entirely unexpected but still remarkably satisfying conclusion. Despite the claustrophobic setting, Giuseppe Tornatore's excellent composition keeps it vividly cinematic, with several memorable moments (the most impressive a beautiful sequence following a song as it floats through the room). The flashbacks are sometimes awkward and I could definitely have done without Depardieu's nudity, but this is still one of the most remarkable films I've seen in recent years. Two-thirds through the movie a power cut hit for two-and-a-half hours, and it was excruciating waiting to get the chance to finish the film.

Very highly recommended indeed. However, the deleted UK PAL DVD is less than perfect. The English subtitles are non-removeable, there is a synchronisation problem on the sound at one point and it only offers the French-language version (although both Polanski and Depardieu use their own voices). The only extra is the Italian trailer.",1112659200,14,1738,5.225806451612903

736677,4,6303916414,"Una Pura Formalita (Giuseppe Tornatore, 1993)

I have now seen two of Giuseppe Tornatore's films (the other being the brilliant The Legend of 1900), and have decided that I will be hunting the man's work down wherever I can find it. A Pure Formality doesn't have the same mastery of pace that 1900 does, but the good points of the film overwhelm the bad ones to the extent that the viewer is likely not to care if the first half of the movie goes a tad slow.

The film centers around an author named Onoff (Gerard Deaprdieu), who is found wandering in the rain, senseless, in the vicinity of a rural murder. He is taken to the strangest police station this side of Pirandello. The head of the station is out for the moment, and Onoff is able to size up the rest of the oddballs working there before the top dog, played by Roman Polanski, gets back. Then the fun really begins; Onoff has lost pieces of his memory, and while the Inspector tries to figure out if Onoff committed murder, Onoff is busy trying to figure out if he did, too. As a catch, to throw everything off just a tad more: the Inspector is also Onoff's biggest fan, and can quote large passages of his books from memory, something of which Onoff himself is incapable, leading to doubts on the part of everyone involved whether Onoff is really who he thinks he is.

Part mystery, part farce, part existential manifesto, A Pure Formality could easily be relegated to that wasteland of films in this genre summed up by a recent commercial featuring a pardocial art-house classic called Look At My Potato. And for the first forty-five or so minutes of the movie, it teeters on the brink of that sort of senselessness. The staff are alternately obsequious and violent, as is the Inspector, while Onoff is by turns helpful, obstructive, and downright abusive. No one seems to have any motivation or consistency. You'll have to trust me when I say it all works out in the end. And it does, to an amazing degree. The last twenty minutes had me sitting, agape, in utter amazement. Suddenly the whole thing made perfect sense...

Aside from the absolute beauty of the plot's construction, a good deal of praise must be given to Tornatore's use of light, or in this case, the lack of it. The station, never well-lit, plunges into a power outage halfway through the film, and most of the rest (it concludes just after dawn the next morning) is lit by candlelight, leading to an even more claustrophobic feeling. Perfectly appropriate for the subject matter, as the police and Onoff both narrow their searches for the various things they hope to find.

A stunning achievement, and one that most mystery fans will find well worth the effort. ****",1046736000,30,2698,4.600831600831601
736678,5,6303916414,"I have seen countless movies and read countless books, and not once I have ever been compelled to write any sort of review for any of them. However, as you may have noticed I have made an exception for this movie, it is a testament to how great I think this movie is.
First of all I urgue you not to read the reviews of this film that give away the ending unless you have already seen the film.
The premise is that a reclusive Author Onof ( Gerad Depardieu ), is being interogated by an unnamed detective ( Roman Polanski) as a possible murder suspect. Through a series of questions the detective finds out Onofs identity as one of the most famous French Authors, in fact, he himself is a huge fan.
THe sequences of events that follow are bizzare, yet wonderfull. The language is pure poetry. And technically speaking the Cinematography and lighting are simply gorgeous.
A bulk of the movie is centered around the Detective questioning Onof, and during this time we learn about his life. These little stories make for some great humanistic moments.
While I don't want to reveal too much, the ending ties in everything, all the loose ends. However, the ending is more than simply that, it has to simply be seen to be appreciated.

Takes quite film to surprise and enthrall me (I'm the guy who knew the ""surprise"" ending to ""Sixth Sense"" five minutes into the movie!), and this is one of them.  Cinematically breathtaking, the story is tight, and the acting is superb.  I wasn't a big fan of Depardieu's American films, but this must be an example what what the actor is capable of.  Brilliant!  IMPORTANT... Be cautious when reading some of the other reviews posted on this page... at least one of them spoils the ending!",1013472000,6,564,4.490196078431373
736681,5,6303916414,"I think the review by Leonard Maltin posted above is MORONIC! This is a masterpiece of film. Both Polanski and Depardieu are in top form and Tornatore's directing is tight and intentional but never over the top. His work here is at least on par with the skill he displayed in Cinema Paradisio, and overall this is an even more successful endeavour than that Academy Award winner. A brilliant piece of theatre (for that is what this film must truly be called) from a genius in modern film.",992131200,4,488,4.556818181818182
736682,5,6303916414,"I rented this movie on a whim one day around when it first was released.  It was the first subtitled movie I have every really enjoyed.  It truely blew me away.  The directing and the lighting are so beautiful.  The man just paints with light. As for Grard Depardieu, I haven't seen him in a more convincing role.  Like the writer said above you totally forget you are even reading subtitles.  I just wish they would release it, I can't wait to see it again.  I can't find it to rent anywhere anymore.",979776000,2,501,4.32258064516129

Within a few minutes you will completely forget that you have been reading English subtitles.  The  story takes you back in forth in time.  A gut wrenching interrogation  between a police detective and a world famous author being investigated as  having been possibly connected to a murder.  The detective is skeptical  that the reclusive author is really who he says that he is.  The  interrogation leads to an admission not necessarily to the expected outcome  but as to the honesty to ones self.  You will jump back in forth through  time until it all pulls together for an ending that I guarantee you could  never have predicted.  It will leave you with your mouth hanging open and  disturbed by its depth for a long time.",963792000,4,849,4.516556291390729
736684,5,6303916414,"This may be the best movie I've ever seen, and I don't like subtitles. A Pure Formality pulls you in and holds you, dropping a few more clues as it winds you tighter and tighter. When I saw Green Card I thought Depardieu  was a hack. I never liked foreign films but this is a masterpiece. I'd like  to see a US release with Harrison Ford in Depardieu's role and Harvey  Keitel as the inspector. (any Hollywood geniuses on line?) If you liked The  Sixth Sense, A Pure Formality is definitely worthwhile.(worth the $100  asking price) Also, check out Cyrano de Bergerac with Depardeu.",941673600,4,582,4.5576923076923075
7856531,4,6303916414,"This is a classic film, directed by one of the greatest European auters, G. Tornatore who delivers a powerful movie on the writer's identity crisis, the blurred boundaries between reality and phantasy and the dubious qualities of the over-active artist's (more particularly writer's) imagination. G. Debardieu and R. Polanski both give outstanding performances portraying the troubled writer Onoff and the police interrogator who happens to be one of the most devoted fans of Onoff's novels and he can recite entire passages from them at any given moment (!). ''A Pure Formality'' is a film based totally in dialogue and the secondary characters are of minor importance, almost non-existent. Pascal Quignard, the writer of the movie's dialogue, the screenplay is Tornatore's,  did a fantastic job and at, many times, I found it hard to keep up with the fast-paced verbal exchange between the two protagonists. I noted down a ton of memorable quotes which provide food for thought and it is certain that you will be thinking ''A Pure Formality'' for many days after watching it. The film contains, almost, none action and it is solely about the dynamics of the relationship which is formed during the interrogation between Onoff and interrogator, or the writer and his fanatic reader. Every true cinema fan ought to see this film immediately!",1523836800,,1341,5.151376146788991

7856533,4,6303916414,"With an increasing number of films about people who are ""already dead,"" the category is in danger of becoming a cliche. I think the test is: once you know the protagonist is dead, is the film worth watching? In this case, I think it is. The clock without hands tells us pretty quickly that we're in another dimension, but we don't get clarity about the specifics until the end, at which point it becomes necessary to watch the film a second time to sort out the details. I was initially unsatisfied by the backstory, as it's sketchy and littered with unconnected bits. A first wife. A second wife. A girlfriend named Paula. A friend of Paula's named Stephane. An editor. A bum named Faubin who Onoff plagiarizes. Particular emphasis is put on Faubin, as Onoff's confession of the plagiarism is the crux of the investigation--the point at which the mouse is caught by the trap in the armoire. Presumably, this is the event that triggers Onoff's plunge into suicidal despair. But he clearly had plenty of problems before that. As it turns out, there's nothing in Onoff's backstory that is crucial. His problem seems to be the accumulation of perceived failures. What ultimately matters isn't the events of his past, it's his despair and separation from mankind. The ""investigation"" in the police station is designed to purge Onoff of his insularity and allow him to see the richness of the human matrix he has chosen to leave. Not an earthshaking idea. Not even a surprising one. But the film is definitely worthwhile.",1477699200,,1516,4.790076335877862
