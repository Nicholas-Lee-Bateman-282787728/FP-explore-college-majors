1.) Steel Cage Match: Hunter Hearst Helmsley w/Chyna vs Mankind

This was only the 3rd Steel Cage match to happen at SummerSlam and it was the opening match of the night! The Mankind vs Helmsley feud was an intensely, prolific feud that had undoubtedly heated up in WWF during the summer of 1997 and this match was probably the highlight of their feud from that year. Mankind takes control of the match in the early going and gets aggressive with the blue blood---slowly turning degenerate. Chyna manages to slow his momentum momentarily, choking him with a belt. Mankind continues his onslaught of Helmsley and tries climbing the cage, but Chyna once again interferes and hits a low blow, stopping him in his tracks. Helmsley sees this as a golden opportunity and hits a golden suplex half way off the cage. Mankind begins tasting the cage as HHH tosses him from side to side against the cold, steel iron blue bars. The match becomes aggressively back and forth as the control of the match shifts constantly between Mankind and Helmsley. At one point Mankind cleverly lifts Helmsley up in suplex position and traps his legs in the bars of the cage, leaving him hanging upside down. Mankind rather than climbing the cage, dives into the chest of Helmsley with a running leaping elbow drop.",1439510400,,1438,4.794354838709677

7867947,4,6304277520,"Steel Cage Match Triple H VS Mankind: The commentating for this match was horrible. I never understood why some cage matches have refs in the cage and other do not. They explained because it was a no disqualification match but isn't every cage match a no dq match? Anyway, this was a great match even with the outside interference from Chyna. The ending was botched but it still looked good.

Goldust VS Brian Pillman: I too remember this feud but this match wasn't so great. Pillman was living the last few months of his life and he was no longer the wrestler he once was. It's really sad to watch after learning this.

LOD VS Godwinns: Summerslam did have some great tag team matches. The ending was weak but I still enjoyed the match overall.

The had a million dollar contest with that nerd Todd Pettingmen (or however you spell it) and a very sexy Sunny and Sable. Holy god, Sunny was hot back in the day. It's worth buying the event to see her outfit.

Ken Shamrock VS British Bulldog: I forgot how much I liked Ken Shamrock. This was a good match but the ending sucked. The aftermath was brutal and probably one of the most violent beatdowns in WWF history.

DOA VS Los Boricuas: Yawn. Stupid match that could have been saved for Raw or the opener instead of near the main event.

Owen Hart VS Stone Cold: A great match despite the botched finish. The weakest roll up in the history of the WWF, but I understand it was because of Austin's broken neck.

Bret Hart VS Undertaker with HBK as the guest ref: A great match that would set up two feuds for the next few years.

Overall, this PPV was a changing of the guards of WWF. They'd soon get away from kid friendly wrestler to D-X. Bret Hart says in his book he'll never forgive Hunter and Shawn for ruining pro wrestling. I don't know if I agree but wrestling hasn't been the same for almost ten years. I believe the internet ruined pro wrestling, the story lines, and the lack of enthusiasm fpr fans. The internet will tell you what will happen at events, the stories are always the same and lack anything new. Now check out Summerslam 1988 compared to Summerslam 2008. The fans would cheer for anything back in 88 and today fans could careless about midcare matches and just cheer for the bigger stars. I prefer WWF from 1984 till they dropped the F. Some might say once they dropped the F, they started to suck. Well I cannot argue with that because for the most part, it's true. It also doesnt help that there is no other company pushing WWE to make them compete better. It's also a sad event to watch because so many wrestlers in this event have passed on-Pillman, Hawk, Crush, Bulldog, and Owen Hart have all passed on to the big ring in the sky. It's so sad to think of all the wrestlers who have left us so young. This event is probably the last clean PPV but don't get me wrong, I loved Stone Cold, The Rock, and D-X. 1999 was the greatest year for promos and interviews.",1237334400,,2938,4.368131868131868
7867948,4,6304277520,"Aww, another old WWF tape that I found in my set as this was during the time that United States vs. Canada feud was in full effect as Bret Hart was leading his Hart Foundation members to lead an anti-American crusade against the Americans that turned on Bret at WrestleMania. To hype up this event even more, each match that involved the Hart Foundation had a special stipulation that would effect that wrestler while at the same time, the main event sparked one of the best feuds in WWF history.

Steel Cage Match: Mankind vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley. This was their third match in their series of PPV matches in a row & just like their previous two encounters, this one really delivered. It's wasn't a bloody cage match but it was full of high impact moves with moments like HHH suplexing Mankind off the top of the cage, Mankind taking a sick shot to the head with the cage door at the hands of Chyna with even Chyna tasting the cage at one point & the highlight of the match where Mankind leaped off the top of the cage to deliver an elbow to Hunter to win the match.

Goldust vs Brian Pillman. The first match involving the Hart Foundation with the stipulation to this one being that if Pillman lost the match, he would have to wear a dress on RAW the next night. Besides that, this was an average but nothing special match with even a botched ending on top of it. They would have a better match a month later at Ground Zero.

Legion of Doom vs Godwinns. This was another match that was average & watchable but this was nothing special past that fact.

WWF European Champion The British Bulldog vs Ken Shamrock. If Bulldog didn't win this match, then he would be forced to eat dog food. This didn't last long but this was an intense match to the point that I wished they had more time to perform since it ended just went it seemed like it was going to get better. However, the real highlight to this match was when Shamrock snapped for the first time ever to the roar of the crowd.

Los Boricuas vs D.O.A. An eight man tag match that was really ""just there"" to continue the feud between these two teams along with the Nation getting involved near the end but again, it was just there to prepare the fans for the main events.

Intercontinental Champion Owen Hart vs Stone Cold Steve Austin. The stipulation here was that if Austin didn't win the title, then he would have to kiss Owen's a**. This was an outstanding wrestling match between these two as they had great chemistry in the ring to the point that Austin would later say that Owen was one of his favorites to wrestle. However, this match is mostly remembered for the infamous moment where Owen botched a piledriver that broke Austin's neck to the point where he was almost paralyzed. For those wondering, this was the beginning of the injury that lead to Austin's retirement five years later.

WWF Champion The Undertaker vs Bret Hart w/Special Referee Shawn Michaels. This match had controversy written all over it with the real life tension between Bret & Shawn being evident here. Along with that, the stipulations to this match were that if Bret didn't win the title, then he would never wrestle in the United States again along with the fact that HBK couldn't show favoritism towards Taker or he would never be able to wrestle in the United States again. As for the actual match, this was an awesome wrestling match as Bret & Taker worked well together with Taker focusing on Bret's back while Bret attacked the legs of the bigger man with cameos from Paul Bearer, Brian Pillman & Owen Hart. HBK didn't become a factor till the end that lead to one of the most memorable endings in WWF history that was the birth of the Taker/Shawn feud.

Overall, this event had some flops but the main matches here were more than enough to make this a quality show with the highlights being the opener, the Intercontinental title match & the main event so I would recommend this event to any wrestling fan.",1214784000,,3958,4.4875

August 3, 1997

Continental Airlines Arena

East Rutherford, New Jersey

Steel Cage Match:

Hunter Hearst Helmsley V. Mankind

Great cage match and the only time a Cage Match has started a WWF Pay-Per-View (Not including the 2001 Rebellion, which isn't a Pay-Per-View). Foley bumps hardcore in this match and Triple H is his typical great self. Foley wins. ***3/4

Goldust V. Brain Pillman

This feud wasn't that good and this match wasn't that good either. The botched ending really didn't help. Goldust wins. *3/4

Legion Of Doom V. The Godwinns

Good match but again, not that good. The ending was good, but the other stuff was just ok. LOD win. **3/4

WWF European Championship:

British Bulldog (Champion) V. Ken Shamrock

Intense match. However, the match was way too short for my liking. Bulldog wins by DQ. ***

Los Boricuas V. DOA

Another good match that wasn't that good. Wait...does that even make any sense? Anyway, The Nation come down and cost DOA the match. **3/4

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Owen Hart (Champion) V. Stone Cold Steve Austin

Awesome match but very scary. Owen has Austin in the Tombstone but instead does a piledriver which is very dangerous. Austin then ""rolls up"" Owen to win the title. ****1/4 Austin is then helped out of the Arena and taken to the hospital. Austin can't wrestle anymore because of the results from this injury.

WWF Championship:

Undeertaker (Champion) V. Bret Hart

Shawn Michaels is the guest ref. Awesome match with an awesome ending. Bret hits Taker with a chair and then Shawn sees the chair in the ring and questions Bret about it and then Bret spits in Shawn's face. Shawn swings the chair and hits....Taker! Bret covers and Shawn counts the 1...2...3! ****1/2 The WWF Title is back where is belongs again with Bret Hart.

Overall, a pretty good show. The opener Cage match was awesome, Hart V. Taker was a classic and Austin injury makes this event a stand out.",1125360000,3,1950,4.845454545454546
