3712105,5,B001NCDFU6,"We loved Madagascar. My kids, ages 7 and 4, love Madagascar 2 even more. This is definitely the goto movie in our house when the kids are bored. There are plenty of references for adults to make it funny.  The lines are witty, the plot holds the interest of small children, the music is fun and the animations is so colorful. We LOVE the penguins. I am a fan of Disney-Pixar, but not many of the recent movies excite the kids as much as Madagascar. Cars may have better animation but the story does not seem to hold their interest as much. I think Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are the best so far. We also love Shrek. In my opinion, Madagascar and Madagascar 2 are in the same ranks.",1239494400,,680,4.190839694656488
3712106,5,B001NCDFU6,"I purchased this video for my daughter and she loves it. My husband and I watched it with her, and enjoyed it also. The material contents were easy for young children to understand and adults to appreciate.",1239148800,,206,4.594594594594595

3712108,5,B001NCDFU6,"We had seen this movie in the theaters and it was so cute, better then the first one, in my opinion,so i wanted to buy it when it came on dvd. Very much worth it. Really will enjoy it. Keeps the kids entertained and they love the songs too. Definitely would recommend for the kids of all ages.",1236902400,,293,4.068965517241379
3712109,5,B001NCDFU6,Well at the end of Madagascar they are boarding the boat to go back to NY then realize that the boat is out of gas... and so begins this story... the penguins have reconstructed an old plane and that is how they will get back to NY... only there is a slight detour and Melman thinks that they are at the San Diego ZOO but as they stay a little while longer they realize that it is Africa and the Lion has to face his past and decide between friends and family.,1235260800,,460,4.010869565217392
3712110,2,B001NCDFU6,"While I think the reviewer who insists the phrase ""crack-a-lackin'"" is somehow a racist comment (ridiculous!), I do have some issues with the subtle racism of this film. Moto-moto (voiced by a black actor) likes Gloria (voiced by a black actress) because she has a big butt. The other characters can't tell the zebras (voiced by a black actor) apart because they all look the same.  I'm surprised they didn't find a way to have these characters eat watermelon and fried chicken or something.

This film has its clever moments (the first 5 or 10 minutes are completely hilarious!), but it's not nearly as good as the first. And the racism is a complete turn-off.",1234569600,4,661,4.739130434782608
3712111,5,B001NCDFU6,"One of the few animated sequels that surpasses the original....and you can quote me on that, folks. Given, it's not quite as funny as the original but it isn't supposed to be because there's a lesson to be learned with this movie. See, the film tells us in a back story that Alex came to the zoo, originally, from Africa. Poachers try to capture him but he escapes in a crate(of all things) and floats all the way to America(where the Central Park Zoo takes him in). Fast forward to present day, the penguins renovate a downed airplane and volunteer to return everybody, including King Julien, Maurice, Mort, and the chimps, to New York. Sadly, they run out of gas and crash-land in Africa where Alex reunites with his Mom and Dad. Makunga, a lion who is vying for control of the leadership of the pride, uses Alex to his advantage to take control. This is where things get interesting.

One thing I've learned in my years of watching movies is that, when you're following up a film that scored big at the box office, you'll have to exceed all expectations and improve on everything(and I do mean everything) that made the original so successful. While I loved the recent release of Open Season 2(and recommend it), it still lacked that certain somethin'-somethin' that made the first film so great. Yet, Dreamworks outdid themselves with this sequel and I applaud them.

Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, the feature stars: Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Chris Rock, Alec Baldwin, Bernie Mack, Sherri Shepard(The View), Will,i.am, Andy Richter, Cedric the Entertainer, and Sacha Baron Cohen. Bonus Features include:the 'Making of Escape 2 Africa' featurette which explores putting together the sequel, an entertaining bit on voice casting, a bit on the research done in Africa to make sure this film looked authentic, MAD Music Videos, and the 'Test Flight of Air Penguin' game.

If you haven't checked out Madagascar-Escape 2 Africa, do so now. You'll be glad you did.",1234224000,3,1997,4.867647058823529
3712112,2,B001NCDFU6,"This movie, while entertaining, has a racist theme. The phrase ""cracker lackin"" is uttered again and again. Can you imagine the contoversy, if this were an equivilent racial slur against black, or any non-white race of people? I suppose that ""cracker lackin"" means ""a place without white people,"" because of the context that it is used in. Because of its repeated use, I have deducted two stars. I deducted one more because the movie was not as entertaining as the original.",1234051200,,474,4.864197530864198

3712153,1,B001NCDFU6,"Like the first Madagascar I question who they made this movie for.  This movie is particularly rich in adult humor that kids don't get. For example the movie explores animals reproduction in the most understanding method (sarcastic) for the hippos that involves a hip-hop party with stylish hippos picking up superficial sex partners at a pool-side gathering with Big-and-Chunky playing.

I don't think this is really a kids movie.  It is just a silly cartoon.",1293408000,3,460,5.1066666666666665

3712157,4,B001NCDFU6,this movie was just as funny as the first but seemed to drag on a bit. i love the funny lines and often quote this moive. not as good as the first but they never are.,1245974400,,166,3.638888888888889
3712158,5,B001NCDFU6,"this is by far the best of all the animated feature films to come out...
if you purchased a new LCD and want to test out the graphics this is the absolute best choice.  Of all the DVD's Ive owned or rented Madagascar 2 is by far the best looking movie I've ever seen.

3712162,5,B001NCDFU6,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, after only mildly enjoying the first Madagascar movie.  But Madagascar 2 surprised me, being leagues ahead of the first.
