Still in my mind is the exciting ""Quincy,"" a favorite of mine, which was kind of a precursor to CSI during the seventies, but without the technology and fantastic photography. However, science is not as easy and fast as these shows portray. The exquisite ""Of Dolls and Murder"" provides a fascinating, highly educational and detailed look on how forensic and criminal science really works. This is the real deal.

The documentary centers on the so-called ""Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death,"" made by the late Frances Glessner Lee, the first female member of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. These ""nutshells"" are miniature doll-house-like scenarios of famous murders of the time. They are quite detailed and, if observed carefully, can give you clues about the murders and how to solve them. Each one is built by one inch to one foot in scale. In fact, part of the film takes place at the State of Maryland's Forensic Medicine Center, where we meet Dave Fowler (Chief Medical Examiner) teaching detectives about forensic science. Also in hand was Jerry Dziecichowicz, who teaches about the nutshell models to detectives. Some of the models mentioned and detailed in the program are: the Three Room Dwelling (1937), Dark Bathroom (1896), Kitchen (1944), Blue Bedroom (1943), Parsonage Parlor (19460, Attic (1946), and more. In total, Glessner made 20 nutshell models, of which 18 are in Maryland, one is missing, and one was destroyed.

The rest of ""Of Dolls and Murder"" features interviews with an assortment of people, including Narem Shankar, one of the ex-producers of CSI, who explains about the fact and fiction between his show and the real world. Of particular interest, was taking a walk on the famous ""Body Farm,"" in which many cadavers are kept exposed to open air at various steps of decomposition. They are used to mimic crime cases, and it is run by the University of Tennessee's Forensic Anthropology Department, which also houses the Bill Bass skeleton collection. We are told that ""forensics is not cool - is science,"" referring to the students that go to forensic school thinking that is just like CSI, not realizing that real life is not like that.

Helmed by Susan Marks, ""Of Dolls and Murder"" is a remarkable documentary for any student of crime and related fields, as well as those hard-core fans of CSI and similar TV shows or movies. For that matter, it is a great movie for everybody. Very instructive, indeed. The DVD features interviews with film director John Waters, segments on the missing nutshells and Frances Glessner Lee, filmmakers' commentaries, and more.

5047186,2,B0071BY2R8,"I was so excited to see this that I bought it sight unseen. That was a mistake. The story of Frances Glessner Lee's Nutshell Studies is a fascinating one, but this film does little to flesh the story out. The first 15-20 minutes delve into creation of the murder dioramas and their creator (Lee).

From there, the documentary takes a negative turn and wastes the closing 45-50 minutes describing modern forensics/crime scene investigation. This would have been effective if the filmmaker hadn't abandoned Waters' narration (his narration literally lasts for 7-10 minutes) and further discussion of Lee and her work. Instead, the viewer is forced to sit through the banter of producers/writers for TV dramas like CSI talk about modern forensics. What do they know about modern forensics, save for the kind that are portrayed on TV in melodramatic fashion?

The film started out strong and completely died before it was given an honest chance of becoming something bigger. Hopefully someone will create a longer, more fleshed out telling of Lee's life, her complex works, and her undeniable influence on forensic investigation.",1343692800,10,1125,5.175824175824176
5047187,5,B0071BY2R8,"Of Dolls and Murder is a great little documentary about the art of the crime scene.  The film is wonderfully narrated by the famous John Waters who's added flair makes the gruesome subject manner oddly enjoyable.

While the film jumps around a bit, studying everything from the popularity of the CSI franchise to a local body farm, the main focus is on Frances Glessner Lee.  Lee was frustrated about her home life, a strict father kept her from continuing her education like her brother.  Her Brother, George Burgess Magrath, would occassionaly visit home and share stories of crime and the criminals who were literally getting away with murder.  These stories would eventually inspire Lee to create a series of intricate dollhouses depicting various crime scenes.

While it might seem juvenile to some, these detailed doll houses helped mold the science of forensics into what it is today.

As mentioned earlier, the film has a few subjects all related to the study of the crime scene.  There are various interviews with experts in the field, from seasoned detectives to the creators of television shows.  We get a behind the scenes look at everything, no stone is left unturned.  As a fan of not just documentaries, but also true crime, I was intrigued from beginning to end.  My one and only complaint is that it wasn't long enough!

Do yourself a favor and check this one out!",1332374400,13,1381,4.829787234042553
8508114,3,B0071BY2R8,"Fascinating topic, but I dislike documentaries that are full of ""talking heads"", especially if they are people unconnected with the topic who just seem to rattle on about what they think the effect on society has been or something equally meaningless. And yes, this woman's professional interests and aspirations may have been thwarted by the conventions of the time, but we'd have to hear it from her (a diary or archived interview or something). Some people are intimidated by what their contemporaries think, others are not. Either way, filming speculation about it by people who never met her is pretense.

Keep the camera on the dolls and have a voiceover give us the facts. Interview one or two policemen at most.",1505520000,3,719,4.9421487603305785
8508115,5,B0071BY2R8,I absolutely love this documentary.  It is very interesting and I've learned a lot about the beginnings of forensic early years.,1473724800,,128,5.095238095238095
8508116,3,B0071BY2R8,"The video is OK in that is covers many of the highlights regarding the Nutshell displays but as a docent for the family home in Chicago, I can say with certainty that some of the facts regarding the life of Frances Glessner Lee have not been truly fact checked.",1445904000,3,261,4.346938775510204
8508117,3,B0071BY2R8,"I wish there was more too it. It was intesting, but didn't go much past what I learned in ""Things you missed in History class.""",1437004800,,127,4.12
8508118,2,B0071BY2R8,"The fabled dioramas and their creator are just a supporting part of this documentary. It is hard to imagine anyone who is interested in the Nutshell dioramas, who also needs to be brought up to speed about why we care about crime scene investigation, and that real life investigation is not glamorous, and there are no tricked-out labs like in CSI. But this banality hogs more than half of
of the film, while the dioramas share second chair with another subject that would be fascinating in its own right: the Body Farm.

The actual scenes and treatment of the dioramas are interesting and entertaining, including Jon Waters' narration, but each scene is dropped as soon as it is introduced. Talking heads interrupt with more of the numbingly obvious, that has nothing to do with the miniature scene just viewed.  It ruins the chance to explore this fascinating scientist and her historic pieces, and makes for a frustrating viewing experience.",1432598400,2,944,4.930817610062893

8508120,5,B0071BY2R8,"I don't quite recall where I first came across this movie--perhaps on Netflix.  I was thrilled to learn a couple of months ago that my best friend had once seen it and loved it.  I promptly bought it on Amazon to watch instantly and we sat down and enjoyed it. It's one of those documentaries that kind of gets up under your skin and makes you want to go find out answers.  If you're interested in forensics, or death, or police work at all, I do recommend this show. It's both a fascinating look at an amazing woman who saw a need to exercise her creativity, as her educational and career desires were stifled by the mores of her time and her parents' desire, as well as a look at how these dollhouse scenes created decades ago are still helping law enforcement hone their observational abilities.",1419120000,,798,4.4520547945205475

8508122,5,B0071BY2R8,"I am left really puzzled but mostly intrigued by this DVD. Mostly because of the fact that I like the depictions of the way the dolls are laying in the same spots as were found at each crime scene. It's almost really wrong how interesting this is but I couldn't look away from this entire film. Frances Glessner Lee - really her name goes without saying. She was completely ahead of anything anyone in her time could fathom. But even then, people were flocking to see her masterpieces of sorts even if the images were a bit disturbing. It is so interesting what you can tell from just one picture taken after it all happened, right where everything was left by the murderer or those who had committed suicide. This disc is not only interesting for those who appreciate the art of dollhouse miniatures but also for those who enjoy mystery and mayhem. Watch and unless you have no imagination or passion for finding the 'who done it'. But anyone who does will love this.",1378339200,,968,4.537142857142857
8508123,5,B0071BY2R8,"The Nutshell Murderer dollhouses are so mesmerizing with their mix of innocence and the macabre that it's no wonder the filmakers felt they had to share them. Along with telling the story of the dollhouses, they tell the inspiring story of the woman who made them, Frances Glessner Lee. Lee is a forgotten pioneer in modern police and forensics techniques, so it is wonderful to see her story told.

The best part of the film though is how the filmmakers feature and follow real detectives and forensic pathologists doing mundane, thankless--and definitely not glamorous-- work to find justice for murder victims and their families. Their dedication to their work is very moving.

In the end, I feel this is a film about passion. The passion for creation, deduction, and justice.",1354752000,3,779,4.984615384615385
