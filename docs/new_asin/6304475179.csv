884678,3,6304475179,The only problem with this movie in my opinion is its running time. It could have also been limited to 60 minutes instead of 90 like Air Force One which is neither short nor to long and very accurate. This movie tells the history of the White House as to how Mr. George Washington decided to get it build and then afterwards the experiences of different Presidents and their families and the staff members. Also tells about the incidents and ups and downs faced by the House. Overall it is a well made informative movie but it is bit too long and to cover the length some material providing no information but only increasing the length has been introduced which could have been avoided.,1111795200,6,687,4.548387096774194

884795,4,6304475179,Morgan Freemen is awesome as he makes it real. Do not purchase it if you wish to know about the construction history of The White House as this documentary is more about the environment and workers in or of the place.,1397692800,2,217,4.317073170731708
884796,3,6304475179,"I truly was looking for a documentary on the history of the White House itself from construction to various renovations and tales of the house itself.  What you get is more of following the staff around getting ready for a State Dinner, the content was NOT what I was hoping for.",1367539200,3,279,4.470588235294118
884797,5,6304475179,"This is one of my favorite National Geographic specials.  Great info about the White House, from conception up to the Clinton presidency, and lots of tidbits about individual Presidents in relation to their life in the House. Much of its history is new info to me, even though I am a native Washingtonian, worked for many years just around the corner from the White House, and have read much about it.  The National Geo cameras were allowed to ""hover"" over the Chief Usher and kitchen & housekeeping staffs as they prepared for a State Dinner.  Very interesting and worth the watch.  You must see the ""edible baskets"" created for the State Dinner!",1364428800,,647,4.75

884800,4,6304475179,"If you have ever been to The White House this will take you down memory lane.  However what you didn't see in the tours you will get to see here.  This takes you from the beginning of The White House to the Clinton Administration.  It will take you where no other tours will take you in the history, Presidential Protection and the personal life of our President. So sit back and enjoy history at it's finest.",1216857600,4,409,4.355263157894737

884803,4,6304475179,"I have recently become very interested in American history and have been buying up every dvd that looks cool regarding our great nation. I was pleasantly surprised by how interesting and captivating this video is. It not only shows the ins and outs of the white house but also touches on some of our history. I found myself grabbing my laptop and researching everytime something piqued my interest such as when the white house was destroyed by fire when captured by the British in 1814. I am looking forward to the day that I can sit down and watch it again with my children.

Met and exceeded my expectations. Morgan Freeman was excellent as well (narration).",1152921600,2,660,4.689655172413793
