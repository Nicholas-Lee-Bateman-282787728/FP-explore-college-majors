1559695,1,B00005JMZK,"Did I mention that this movie was horrible? I don't want to make it sound like I was terribly disappointed or anything -- I figured this would be an entertainingly awful heap of refuse, and it lived up to my expectations. I would not say that its utter lack of aesthetic quality would make it as enjoyably bad as, say, ""Battlefield Earth"" (the last decade's benchmark for enjoyably rotten movies), but ""AVP"" is nonetheless a steaming pile of dung.

(Warning: spoiler to follow. Not that you should care.)

Indeed, I managed to get in a few good laughs as my friends and I made fun of this movie throughout it. And I was entertained by the frustration that many other people in the theater expressed as it got worse and worse, particularly when that chick joins forces with the predator in order to defeat the aliens and win the predator's respect. Normally, I do not take pleasure in the misfortune of others, but if you expected this movie to have any redeeming value, then I am afraid that you have very little to live for and you deserve to have your hopes and dreams shattered.",1092355200,4,1081,4.538461538461538
1559696,3,B00005JMZK,"Whenever Hollywood decides to merge two distinct horror genres, the result is usually a slambang affair between the combatants. JASON VS FREDDIE comes to mind. But in this case, the twin horror films were taken more from the comic versions of Alien and Predator. In ALIEN VS PREDATOR, the audience is treated to a rapid isolation of the inevitable research team in a dark, claustrophobic labyrinth.  The time is now and the location is the Antarctic. Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is more than 100 years from being born.  Somehow the scriptwriters had to find a way to place the slimy aliens and the head-hunting predators in the same scenes without straining audience credibility.  The manner in which this is done isobvious and heavy-handed, which is no surprise since both vicious races ought to be nowhere on the same page. However, they do combine in a way that nudges the audience into a surface acceptance of the plot.  Within the first fifteen minutes, you are catapulted into the midst of a bitter internecine quarrel that has been brewing between them for centuries.  Despite the quick dispatching of most of the human beings in a desolate ziggurat of a hybrid Egyptian, Aztec, and Asian construction, the presence (or absence)of the humans is strictly a sideshow.  They get picked off but the ultimate battle is between the off world killers.  The action is fast and surprisingly bloodless. In fact, you see more alien acid blood or predator green goo than red human blood. For those who have memorized whole pages of dialogue from the original alien and predator films, you can appreciate humorous allusions to clever quips from Schwarzenegger, Sigourney Weaver, and Danny Glover. ALIEN VS PREDATOR dares to try to lead some new ground in the way the human victims interact with their twin killers. If one cannot reason with one of them, then one must try to reason with the other. The ancient proverb, ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" forms a startlingly new subtext with the survivors.  There are no big Hollywood names here, with the exception of Lance Henrickson, who played an android in ALIENS but here is a one-minded industrialist who seeks to profit from the ongoing battle.  Whether the producers will succeed in doing the same will depend on how many viewers are willing to suspend their disbelief long enough to gape at the rapid-fire action and ignore logical flaws that would otherwise intrude. I recommend ALIEN VS PREDATOR and expect to see a sequel or two.",1092355200,,2484,4.881235154394299
1559697,3,B00005JMZK,"Before I kick off this review, something should be made very clear: I am a HUGE fan of Alien and Predator.  I've seen Predator so many times I could act every scene out of memory, and I've watched Alien and Aliens so much that I'll soon be able to act them out without the aid of a script soon too.  So what happens when you put these movie mega-monsters together?  Well, probably not what you would expect.

The fervor began in 1990.  I was sitting through Predator 2 in the jammed theatre, the movie was moving, and then it got to the end...where the Alien skull was proudly displayed in the trophy case.  Then shortly after, the unforgettable Dark Horse Comics series came out, pitting the monsters against one another.  Undoubtedly one of the best crossovers imaginable.  So now, a full 14 years later, with AVP scripts being tossed all around hollywood for over a decade, we have one of the most sought after crossovers of all time.

So was it good?  Well, that's all up to interpretation.  People panicked when Paul W.S. Anderson took the helm, and with good reason...his track record is less than stellar, and while I enjoy a few of his movies he is certainly nearer the bottom of the Hollywood reputation list.  Oh...not to mention that the PG-13 rating KILLED this movie.  Many people thought to overlook that fact, but you simply cannot take 2 R-rated movie franchises, 6 movies between them, all rated R, and then slap them together and come out with a successful PG-13.  It just doesn't happen, and that's one of the reasons this movie suffers...aside from other stand-out reasons.

Being that it is PG-13, this is a virtually bloodless movie.  Granted creature death is abundant, but the human death is little more than implied or suggested rather than actually shown.  Having been through Predator 1 and 2, that just doesn't sit well.  Of course blood and gore do NOT make a movie, but these are two franchises that are renowned for their bloody combat (how could we forget Billy's fatal encounter, or the fate of the Colonial Marines?).  So needless to say, the PG-13 rating boils down the movie to high-impact action, but only implied death and suggested gore, though the Alien/Predator gore does get grisly.

But as I said, Gore does NOT make a movie.  What happens with this film is that the plot is surprisingly solid for the first half hour.  The cast, while not even memorable in anyway save for the talented Lance Henrikson(whose role in the film ties things together), is decent enough to keep the movie going.  I had no faith in Sanaa Lathan but I was surprised at her acting...it was decent.  The problem with the film is that once the action starts after about 30 minutes, the mere notion of 'plot' seems to be lost.  Granted, you came to this movie called 'Alien vs Predator' because you want to see Aliens fighting Predators in bloody, action-packed combat, but a good movie needs a strong plot.  The nods to the original comic series are there, even borrowing some elements, which was a surprise.

As for design, I thought everything was quite good.  The Aliens looked menacing and behaved as you would expect.  The Predators were very intimidating, and the mask and armor designs were excellent.  The new technology introduced to us in this film was also quite good, making the Predators seem far more sophisticated than previously thought.  The set designs were excellent, and the Queen alien is a sheer monstrosity that once again does the beast justice, unlike the abysmal Alien: Resurrection.  My major gripe was with two things: the overuse of CGI on the Aliens...I would've rather have seen clever puppetry and suits rather than blatantly obvious CGI.  Secondly, the design of the Predator faces...utterly horrible.  They were far too puppet-like and bore almost no resemblence to the classic look.  If anything, I would say one of the worst parts of the film was seeing the unmasked Predators.

As for everything else...I wasn't particularly thrilled with the overall presentation.  The Predators behaved like bulky, clumsy black-belt linebackers.  Only the Aliens were really done justice in this film in terms of behavior.  The fights became borderline bad...I appreciate the nod to the fact that it started out as a comic book, but the fights became TOO comic book and ridiculous.  Once the action between the Alien and Predator starts it moves so fast that you sit looking at the aftermath wondering how it happened.  Without spoiling anything, I will say that this movie greatly favored one race way too much over the other, which becomes quite apparent at the very first encounter.  The action took over for the plot and got a bit ridiculous after a while, which made the movie drag and lose focus.

Of course the ending screams sequel, and you know they'll do it.  This movie had Anderson's trademark style all over it, which in my opinion brought it down.  The Predators simply did not behave like the Predator we know and love, and at some points even the Aliens were just not `acting the way they should'.  If they plan a sequel, I would hope that it lands in the hands of a better director.  Anderson did OK at best, but this movie was too bland and SHORT (less than an hour and a half!) to make a decent flick.  14 years of waiting...for a rather dull disappointment.  Pray for the release of a Director's Cut DVD with an R-rating, and we're in business!  Until then, Predator/Alien fans see the film, but don't expect much.  Take faith in the fact that its better than Alien: Resurrection...but then watching a slug do a mile-run would be better than Alien: Resurrection too.",1092355200,3,5625,4.7415036045314105
1559698,1,B00005JMZK,"Director Paul Anderson is a bad director, can't we just admit it?  ""Mortal Kombat"", ""Event Horizon"", ""Soldier"", ""Resident Evil""- movies that could have each made for an interesting premise, then turned over and beaten to death by bad writing, bad acting, and very bad special effects.  Made clear in the extremely terrible ""Resident Evil"", Anderson can't even take the simple premise of a video game and build off that.  That film wasn't even about zombies- it was about a laser...

""Alien vs. Predator"" is Anderson's best attempt yet- and even at that it's very bad.  The story is completely steered in the wrong direction.  What will anger fans is how he tries to make the predators the heroes, and the aliens ultimately the villains.

The story takes place in October, 2004 where thermal scans at Weyland Enterprises pick up a signal coming from somewhere in Antarctica.  Through three-dimensional configuring, the company discovers a pyramid thousands of feet beneath the ice.  A team of archeologists is immediately assembled and sent on a mission ""to make history"".  When they get there, they realize it's the same location of a previous settlement from 1904.  The people were said to have disappeared overnight.  Ready to prep the digging process, the team also discovers a perfectly dug hole in the ice, seeming to be from a team who's discovered this great find before them.  When they get down there and into the pyramid, the heiroglyphics on the walls explain the structure is an ancient battleground for aliens and predators.  The queen alien is unfrozen and set to lay eggs, while the predator clan dispatches three warriors for the fight.  What our humans realize is that the predators were once ancient gods of a previous civilization, and the people once worshipped them.  The predators would have races of aliens bred to show their strength and power in battle.  If the predators were to lose the fight--well that is supposedly the purpose for their self-destruct device on their arm; the entire civilization is wiped out.  Now they're back one-hundred years later--because of course the predators have a metric system of time as one character configures--and they are ready to breed their enemies again for another fight.

This movie is a disaster from every angle, for the exception of a few well-engineered action scenes where the predators and aliens battle each other.  When humans are onscreen, it's ridiculous.  The dialogue is bad.  The archeologists come with automatic weapons without reason--only to give the film an explanation for the predators to slay humans when they first arrive.

The creatures themselves look good I must say.  The predators have new sophisticated masks giving them their own distinguishable character. They have fancy new supersized Chinese stars that don't melt when going through the flesh of an alien, but the walls and everything else that's metallic do...  The aliens look good when they aren't running around--then they're the same junk that the visual effects team came up with in ""Alien 3"" and ""Resurrection.""  The fights are generally fun to watch for the majority of the film.

The debate over the PG-13 rating isn't even worth the effort.  The predators don't rip out spleens or remove any skulls.  Right before a kill, the camera cuts to a different scene.  There is blood, and it actually shows a chest bursting (which stupidly happens minutes after the embryo is planted) and a chest that has already been bursted through.  The language is toned down.  Of course now that the PG-13 rating has allowed an ""F"" word in a film, it's used, but not even on the line that counts.  A character is looking at an alien and says the ""Predator"" franchise line: ""You're one ugly mother...""; it then cuts away after ""mother.""  There's lots of alien slime and Predator blood.  I felt it really pushed the PG-13 rating.  Somehow Fox got away with it.  Its rating is ultimately irrelevent.

The plot is the major act of idiocy.  The writing team of this film has made the predators friends with the human race, which is going to outrage predator fanatics--including myself.  That ruins the purpose of the first two Predator films.  Why would they hunt the humans in either of those films if that is the case?  They could just hunt aliens in Antarctica for a real battle.  If they are our gods, we aren't their prey.  Why would the predators be sent to the jungle or to Los Angeles when we are supposedly not their enemies?  And why in the end of the original ""Predator"", when Arnold Schwarzenegger asks the predator what he is, the predator responds ""What the hell are you?""  If humans are the servants of predators in ancient times, they would know what we are.

The movie gets downright sad when Lex (Sanaa Lathan), the leader of the expedition, decides to take sides with the predators and teams up with one.  The two take on a bunch of aliens together and she ends up saving the predator's life.  In exchange for her kindness, he makes her a weapon out of an alien tail.  This isn't the worst of it yet.  She talks to the predator and the movie allows the predator to actually understand her.  In one scene they enter a room full of eggs ready to hatch.  The predator takes the self-destruct device off his arm and makes a hand gesture to Lex.  She responds, ""Oh...that's a bomb.""  The predator sets it to detonate and they run to a sling-shot cart of some sort that sends them flying up through the two-thousand foot hole.  Then he gives her the mark of the warriors and removes his mask only to show the one of the most ludicrous things to ever take place in movie history--a happy looking predator with a face that would make Stan Winston puke from total idiocy.  The two might as well have hugged and shaken hands.

By the end of this very short movie, we are left stupified.  Anderson has taken two brilliant franchises (excluding the bad sequels), and given us cardboard characters, a dumb movie set, outrageous plot holes and inconsistencies, bad moving special effects, and one of the worst endings in recent memory.

This is an awful movie.  If you're actually expecting one species to dominate, you've already lost.",1092355200,11,6179,4.811016144349478
1559699,5,B00005JMZK,"Just came back from seeing Alien Vs. Predator and I liked it. It would of been nice to see Ripley,but this movie takes place before Alien 1,in are present year 2004. So Ripley hasn't been born yet(I think?)It's been a long time since the last Predator movie came out,so it's nice to see a new Predator movie on the screen. And it's been 7 years since Alien Resurection. Now we have Alien's and Predators together in one Kick ASS movie. But I do hope they are going to do another Alien movie with Ripley's clone,like to see what she's been up to since the last Alien movie?",1092355200,,572,4.355140186915888
1559700,4,B00005JMZK,"This movie had huge potential. and when I went to see it (Yes I have seen the release) I was not expecting much. Fortunatly it was not that bad as I feared I actually enjoyed this film far more than Alien 3 and it is far more superior than that Dreadful Alien Ressurection.

  I won't need to tell you the plot it has been told a 1000 times already, but the actors did a pretty good job in their roles. It is actually interesting to see differnt people with differnt Ideas in life come together [E.G. when Alexa(Lathan) who is very anti-gun  asks Adele (De La Boulaye) why is she carrying a weapon and Adele gives a good answer). Plus it is very interesting to see what kind of man Bishop Weyland (Henriksen) is, whose company becomes the much powerful corperation in the Alien Films.

  Now the draw back of this movie is that the film suffered was its pace. The pace was not slow it was too fast and as a result we cannot see any more proper charactor devalopment. Plus we never get to see any vicious brutality and violence (this movie is PG-13 you know)but there is a lot of action. Another problem is that if you have seen the Predator or Alien films you will not be excited as much because we have already seen it before.

  My final take on why this got a PG-13 rating is that the Producers not Paul WS Anderson were to blame they just want it that way so younger people can see it so it could  make more money. When will they ever learn? (hint: never)

But I am not upset because I have got a free ticket and used it (I got it when I bought Predator Special Edition DVD) you can do that to. But hurry it expires on September,

So in closing not a bad movie to watch, in fact I enjoyed it as it is but don't expect a Ridley Scott or a John McTierman flick.

  I hope this review helps.

P.S. Why was Hans R. Giger not credited for this movie when Stan Wiston, Thomas Brothers, O'Bannon and Shusett were?!!!  Shame on you FOX!!",1092355200,,1933,4.178378378378379
1559701,4,B00005JMZK,"With the release of AVP comes the end of a long wait for many a die hard fan of the Predator and Alien franchises.  The drama before the movie came out was child-like, with many fans pointing fingers at the director, Paul W.S. Anderson, and calling him names.

A lot of reviewers will simply pan it because they were skeptical before the movie came out, thus, already having a negative attitude both toward the director and the movie itself.

The acting is fair, consisting of under-used talent. Sanaa Lathan does a nice job as our new heroine.  Unfortunately, the movie suffers greatly from a lack of character development which was prominent in both the first Alien movies and the original Predator.

A fun movie, excellent when stacked up to others in the genre, although the genre is limited to other ""versus"" films.

Special effects drive the movie, and it is obvious the director seeks to have as much ""real"" imagery as possible. Unfortunately, this results in a realization that both the Alien and Predator characters are seen as puppets and computer generated elements - making the believability of the monsters drop.

While there are some serious issues regarding the validity of the plot when taking into consideration the ""rules"" set forth in the original movies, as a stand alone, it works.  Although I think the director failed in capturing the spirit of the previous Predator and Alien movies, he does offer up new concepts worth checking out.

The DVD is worth a buy if only to view the background information regarding the comic book series, and costume designs.",1092355200,4,1578,4.858208955223881
1559702,5,B00005JMZK,"I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening of Alien vs. Predator. The film I saw was fully finished and didn't have the unfinished look of most screenings that are shown weeks ahead of the release date. This will be the same film that will be premiering nationwide on August 13th. I even got a nice Sideshow WETA polystone figurine set of the two alien beasties duking it out, but on to the film itself.

I went into this screening expecting nothing but close to two hours of nonstop, mindless violence with a heavy twist of sci-fi thrown in the mix. I am happy to say that it was exactly what I expected and to my surprise the film even had a decent plot and story to explain a few things. AvP is one film project that has been anticipated by most scifi fans and especially fans of the Aliens and Predator film franchises. Since the very early 1990 when Dark Horse Comics first introduced a comic miniseries detailing the match-up of these two iconic sci-fi villains, every fan wanted it to be made into a film. It took Hollywood a little over 14 years, but its finally here and I can say that it was worth the wait.

The film itself is loosely based on that first comic miniseries, but I think basing the story on Earth actually made the film's story easier to explain. I will get this out of the way and say that the plot and story is pretty interesting and explains enough of why both creatures are to be found on Earth. It even explains why these two creatures have had a part in some of Earth's past history. The story gives the audience enough of a background but it doesn't try to overexplain and thus get in the way of the main reason why people want to go see this film: nonstop action.

Alot of fans, myself included, had some reservations when it was announced that Paul W.S. Anderson --- of Soldier, Event Horizon and Resident Evil fame --- was going to direct AvP. Even up to darkening of the theater lights my reservations continued, but once the credits rolled and the film began I was hooked. One could tell that Anderson was a fan of these two franchises and wanted to give both their due and respect when making this film. It is hard to say anything else about this film without giving away any of the plot points, but I have to say that the sequences involving the arrival of the Alien and the Predator are classics. The humans are relegated to being bait and prey, but they make a good accounting of themselves in the end. Even the Aliens were given enough of a personality to stand out as being more than mindless, killing machines.

The FX work on this film is pretty good and doesnt seem to have too much CG work. I could be wrong and they may have used alot of CG, but it is not noticeable in the film if they did. For all in chat who wished for some sort of Zerg-type rush, there is a scene in the film that will satisfy that wish. The Predators each had distinct looks to differentiate each one from the other Predator.

The acting is quite good and decent for a film of this type, but its nothing write the Academy about. Lets just say that the actors in this film did not embarrass themselves. Lance Henriksen who played Bishop in Aliens did his workmanlike effort for the film, but the standout in the film acting-wise is Sanaa Lathan as arctic-guide Lex.

AvP is not a perfect film and I wasn't expecting it to be, but I was more than surprised to have left the theater wanting it to continue and see what happens to the survivors. The film is a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end and hopefully it succeeds enough in the box-office for the studios to warrant a sequel. I would recommend this film to the same people who enjoyed the films of the these two franchises and for people who enjoy a nice action-packed couple of hours. Now if you go into this film expecting AvP to be some scifi Wuthering Heights or a Merchant-Ivory film, then I would suggest you go see A Home at the End of the World instead.",1091491200,14,3956,4.339189189189189

I enjoyed it enough that I put it on my Christmas list, and when I didn't get it, I came to Amazon to buy it. It's a fun movie with a lot of action, decent special effects and a good premise. It isn't deep nor does it have anything in the way of character development or investment, but it's fun and entertaining and good for an evening of mindless escapism.

The audio is fine as well, no issues there.
It's called AVP or Alien vs Predator but it turns out it's more humans vs aliens vs predators and then the enemy or my enemy thing happens and the humans team up with the predators and it still doesn't turn out too well for all involved really.
I love the Alien movies so I get all of them involving aliens, I like the Predator movie as well and have that, but if I wasn't a big fan and didn't want to complete my collection I probably would have skipped it in terms of owning it. Seeing it sure, but not worth owning as it takes a lot of liberties with the Alien universe mythos and there's a lot of unanswered questions in this movie.

1561195,1,B00005JMZK,"I saw this in the movie theater during its original release.  I flat out hated it.  The movie might as well have been G rated with My Little Ponies and Care Bears.  Both franchises are known for suspense, gore and action.  Sadly in this film all we get to see is sub par action scenes and watch the camera pan away during every kill scene and with no suspense throughout the movie.  The film has a very weak plot in general.

I was expecting the movie to be darker not so lit up everywhere.  The movie does not really follow any of the rules set up by previous films in the Predator movies.  Such as the Predators only come to hunt during extreme heat waves, they don't seem to like cold weather.  I expected the action scenes to be much more brutal as well, not so cream puff.  There is a lot the director could have done in this movie to make it much better, whether handicapped by the studio or not.  Could the Aliens smell the Predators even with the camouflage on?  All the human characters seemed very underdeveloped and just basically get in the way, they add very little to the movie itself.

Overall this movie just seemed to be lacking in a lot of places.  Like other reviewers have mentioned the movie might have been a lot better taking place on a different planet where the Colonial Marines get caught in the middle or something along those lines.  After seeing all the original films especially Alien and Predator this movie is a shell of the franchise and is better left unwatched. The movie also seemed to be way to short where the original films spend a lot of time on character development and story.  Like the sad Terminator franchise the studios are just running both of these franchises into the ground with inferior sequels Rocky 7 anyone?  Just stay away from this sucker, their are much better popcorn movies out there.  This movie should have a toxic warning sticker on it.",1453852800,,1898,4.468023255813954

1561650,5,B00005JMZK,"Investigating a pyramid bearing Aztec, Egyptian, and Sumerian features and found under the Antarctic ice, a team discovers the building is a breeding-place of alien prey as well as the hunting ground for a group of equally alien hunters who apparently regard the killing of the creatures as some kind of rite of passage. As creatures are released and the hunters return for their sport, the explorers get caught in the middle and have to battle both to survive.

Other than the original Predator, I think this is the best one so far. It poses questions which the story doesn't answer, of course, such as: 1) Is the Alien hermaphroditic? Since only the adult Queen is ever shown in any movie and as soon as re-activated in this one, she begins laying eggs, one wonders. 2) Why did the predator(s) kill off all the other explorers but join forces with the one survivor?  Indeed, why kill off anyone?  The aliens would eventually do it for them.  Was it merely a way to get them out of the way so they could do their own hunting unimpeded?  The flashback of an explanation a la Chariots of the Gods, shows the Predators coming to Earth, ordering the pyramid built and then choosing human incubators from the conquered peoples which raises another question: 3) How did they get three diverse people in the same spot at the same time, and that place being at the South Pole, though it was then a tropical area? 4) After apparently abandoning the pyramid when it was under so many feet of ice, why did the hunter now return?

(I know, I'm asking too many questions...but inquiring minds ( and nit-pickers) want to know...)

These queries notwithstanding, the intricacies of the pyramid with its many traps, sliding floors, and moving walls is an exciting bit of CGi, as are the baby-aliens. The film formula is well in place and it's easy to point out who's going to survive and who isn't, so simply concentrate on the obvious survivor and let it go at that. There's plenty of action and a glorious final explosion, though surprisingly little actual screen-time showing the expedition members getting killed is fairly non-existent . (I'd really have liked a scene showing the survivor explaning all this to a group of reporters!)

It's a great bit of escapism, and, as per the ending of the movie, this story might very well serve as a Prequel to ""Alien."" If viewed before seeing that one, it would actually fit rather nicely into the Alien sequence.",1432771200,,2444,4.68065268065268

1561659,4,B00005JMZK,"This was a fun ride of a movie; although I have seen Predator & all the Alien movies, I tried not to go into this with preconceptions about the probability of the story line or how they ""changed"" things (we know from prior movies) about the Aliens & Predators to fit the story line here, and as long as you can do that, too, you'll probably enjoy the film.  My 17-tear-old daughter really enjoyed it, but she has not seen any of the films that pre-dated this one.  If you go in thinking you'll see what you know from the prior films, you'll be disappointed.  Lots of action, lots of great CGI, the actors are basically puppets compared to the aliens (both kinds) and the story is a bit thin, but again, if you like action sci-fi, it's worth a rental.  The story follows a group of scientists/explorers as they investigate a heat bloom that was detected by satellite on a small island off Antarctica (or maybe it's the Artic, I forget - it's not important) and discover an ancient pyramid (maybe the first on Earth ever) which was built for the purpose of allowing the Predator aliens to hold a sort of ""coming of age"" game using Alien aliens (the double-jawed, acid-blood variety) as prey in a rite of passage into manhood.  Every hundred years, the Predators return to earth, where humans offer themselves as sacrificial hosts to the Alien parasites, so they can spawn and give the predators their prey.  The goal is to kill off all the Aliens, but if the Predators lose, they destroy all life in the vicinity to be sure the Aliens don't take over the Earth.  Some of this group of scientists/explorers unwittingly make themselves hosts for the games and the action takes off from there.  An alliance eventually forms between the one Predator left standing and a woman who led the expedition.  Together, they try to wipe out the Aliens & their queen to save themselves (and everyone else in the world).",1430352000,,1903,4.573529411764706

1562086,5,B00005JMZK,"20th Century Fox Producer Jon Davis summed it up and said it best: ""When Director Paul Anderson came into my office with his script and concept art for AvP, it blew my mind that he had formed such a perfect blending of the two Sci-Fi franchises."" Anderson clearly expanded upon both ""worlds"" by uniting the Aliens to the Predator Universe and in the process he includes the ""back-story"" to the Weyland Corporation and even goes so far as to tip his hat to ""Bishop,"" the android seen in Jim Cameron's brilliant sequel to Ridley Scotts's Alien (playing with a knife).The ""set up"" of having the Predators as the builders of ancient pyramids on Earth (and other worlds?) in order to have human hosts for their ""Rite of Passage"" into adulthood for young Warriors builds upon the theory and popular urban legend set forth in Erich von Daniken's ""Chariots of the Gods."" With that as a platform to set up the story, Billionaire Weyland sets off on a great adventure to claim a mysterious Pyramid buried deep beneath the ice in Antarctica. Little do he and his entourage realize, these ruins are actually ancient testing grounds for young Predators to endure in order to become full fledged Warrior-Hunters. Fans of he Alien and Predator franchises will not be disappointed. All in all a great popcorn film that is thought-provoking and fun for all Sci-Fi fans.

A note on AvP: Requiem: As AvP was a hit for Fox, Studio Execs decided to ""cash in"" on the new franchise and churned out the very disappointing AvP Requiem that supposedly occurred withing hours after the conclusion of AvP. The 2nd film suffered from a weak (contrived) plot; plodding and less than inspired Directing (NOT Paul Anderson) and poorly-acted Characters that were unappealing at best. It comes off like a low-budget Sy-Fy Channel gore fest with scenes and characters introduced for no other reason than to provide a body count as in a slasher film... with excessive gore & violence in place of any redeeming plot.",1418428800,,1979,4.803519061583578

1562174,5,B00005JMZK,"I've read quite a few reviews about this movie and plenty of others on Amazon. It's fascinating to me that film critics are even paid anymore, especially due to the people who write their reviews here. Obviously, there's always the dumb dumbs who just talk out their butts because they can..... Morton Downey Jr., for example, where most of his programming required very little if any intellectual dialog, yet still those kinds of people are entertaining due to their fecal-embalmed muscles between their ears they consider as a brain. Here's my take, not just on this movie, but to the reviewers as well....
many times a director is muffed over by corporate sponsors funding their projects, and people rip, roar, hoot and holler about a director butchering a movie, when about 80% of the time it's the companies funding the project that butcher the films/movie/digital whatever people call visual media nowadays. Keep in mind, we have very brilliant minds out there, but they are hindered by corporate chimpanzees to effectively produce a good piece of media or product. So fellow reviewers, bear those factors in mind before verbally assaulting the director for a companies decisions to ruin a brilliant piece of work for they're ""bottom line.""

1562434,3,B00005JMZK,"It seems too generous to give Alien Vs. Predator four stars, so I am going with three, but I want to be clear that I actually quite enjoyed this film. While the execution is not anything great, the premise is more interesting that I expected, the pacing is very good, and there is plenty of both suspense and excitement.

The biggest problems are those inherent in most sci-fi B-movies, i.e. unimaginative direction and CGI that is often quite lackluster-to-weak for a modern film. One might also point out the plot strains the credibility of the titular characters/creatures, but I see it as bending tradition rather than breaking, and it's all in good fun here.

What this film does have going for it, to be specific, is a very solid cast (including Aliens alum Lance Henriksen and one of my favorite actresses, the much under appreciated Sanaa Lathan) again a premise that is pretty well-conceived to fuse the Aliens and Predators into a really engaging film. This film's plot could make for a great video game, and in this case, I mean that as a compliment. Given that AvP is not really a cinematic work of art, it remains at least an exciting, engrossing spectacle. I am fairly picky and you will never find me playing the apologist for the Transformers films, for example, but I will throw down a recommendation for this one. If you are looking for a transportative sci-fi thrill ride to kill a couple of hours with, Alien Vs. Predator will do fine.",1405209600,,1455,4.6796875

1562511,2,B00005JMZK,"I own all of these things on BluRay discs (I mean, Predator is a favorite character of mine ever since childhood), but this crossover attempt is just plain ridiculous. This marriage is far too cynical to be successful. Now, on the positive side, the BluRay is great looking, and the script does have a wealth of interesting source ideas within it. However, none of these positive qualities successfully translate into a totally redeeming package. For one thing, we see way too much of the Alien (the Queen especially) in this film which, although terrific looking, is simply plain obvious and not in any way frightening. In fact, it seems to me that the Predator and Alien universes are more disparate than most realized; the Predator is an action movie character, and the Alien is a weird/sf story character, and neither of these two really come together in an exciting way. And that is the film's greatest sin. I do not understand how a laborer in the field of ""sci-fi"" and horror film franchises of Ronald Shusett's caliber can become so desperate as to pull from the well of Erich von Daniken in order to receive inspiration, but here he's done it--""At the Mountains of Madness"" this ain't, but there are a couple of good adventure scenes here and there that make it worth watching...once. Whereas the original ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" films are unique and quite watchable many times over (as most Americans know), this one is not nearly as durable a product as the originals are. The Predator character is always creepy, always terrifying, but here he is put into such a silly plot that it's difficult to take either him or the Alien character(s) completely seriously. I seriously don't think that this whole concept was a good idea, but that's just my opinion. Sad, too, because this film was/is based upon a comic book series that had potential, although maybe it would have been best to rework such an attempt into an animated series as opposed to a live-action continuation of two very (again) disparate original films. Ridley Scott, according to Wikipedia, claims that he isn't ready to ""take the step"" of watching these new mash-ups, and he's probably most wise--this is not the Alien that I came to fear and respect from the 1979 classic and this fact, alone, hurts (instead of being used as a metaphor for disease, the Alien is here merely a side-character playing war games with the more hostile-looking Predators). The filmmakers here are attributing a mythological step for the Predator character that I don't think he can quite take, considering the whole Aztec link (I thought, oh no, not again!) and all that junk. These movies seem to be adding fuel to the fire of an already deluded public's interest in pre/post-apocalyptic occurrences, and more public anxiety is the last thing that we need (in my opinion). This should have been more fun but, considering how we had come to think of each of these characters up to this point, the film had to be done right in order to work. On the whole, it wasn't. They've removed all the mystery from the original films and replaced those qualities with a seriously hackneyed script concerning pseudo-scientific madness that only lower-income high school students would consider to be brilliant, along with a filmmaking sensibility that seems to care little for subtlety or suspense (and have little understanding of the fact that what made the original films work so well was not their otherworldly ""sci-fi"" effects, but their fairly realistic settings within the context of horror film inventiveness and rethinking). At least ""Prometheus"" tried to introduce some fresh ideas. D+",1400457600,,3637,4.915447154471544

This movie DID do a great job on the aliens. But that is the only good thing I can say about this movie. I saw this movie in the theater with my brother. About 3/4 of the way through, I told him if they make the female lead and the last Predator run off into the sunset together to hunt aliens, I'm gonna leave.

1562516,3,B00005JMZK,"I mean come on, you don't expect this movie to have a wonderful plot, or greatly structured screenplay(and it doesn't), but it is a fun Saturday morning type of film. I found the storyline of ancient aliens to be a nice little attempt at story before all the senseless killing ensues. The actors apart from Lance Hendrickson, are pretty terrible, and you are left rooting for the Predators, I guess, which is somewhat off putting. Extras on the disc include a commentary that they take more seriously than they did the film, which makes it pretty funny. Overall I think it is worth a watch, and if you enjoy it, it has rewatchability and isn't badly priced at $5.  Final note, if you are a fan of the Predator, be for warned they get their butts handed to them constantly by the Aliens even though they were designed by the predators to be hunted, so  yeah.",1397347200,,857,4.487179487179487

Then we watched Predator and Predator 2 (the first one ages well - the Danny Glover one sadly not so). So we're ripe for Aliens Vs. Predator.
Something else I should mention is that Ridley Scott is helping me grade on a curve because of the unbelievable dungheap that was Prometeus - terrible, terrible script.
So here we are watching AVP and loving it. The two aspects we enjoyed the most were the perspective of the Predators when facing Aliens (they're not running, they're thrilled in the hunt), and the interaction between the main character and one of the predators.

I liked the strong central character and the ideas presented about warriors and how warriors can have what is essentially a common language against a common enemy.

However, it just lacked in that ""it"" value that left it feeling a little shallow and disappointing.  Even thinking about it later it's hard to put a finger on it, and maybe it's something else with the characters or story line, or just a lack of overall effort.

If you're looking for an ""ok"" movie and have a couple bucks, you'll at least get that out of it for a couple of hours.

I won't expose any spoilers by telling the rest of the storyline that lends itself to a lot of character sympathy for the humans and the Predator, but it is well-written.

1562896,1,B00005JMZK,"I saw this film in theatres when it first came out and I like many fans were fairly excited for it. However, AVP could have been so much better than it is. On a whole this film is a mishmash of silly themes aimed at very young audiences. However, it is so much better than its direct sequel AVPR which is a completely unwatchable. AVP takes the concepts from the original 1990's era graphic novel ""Aliens vs. Predator"" and synthesizes it with the now overly used Chariots of the God's concept, of ""ancient aliens."" The director Paul W.S Anderson is known for over the top ""comic book-like"" movies and penned a story that is very weak and convoluted. Then in an even more odd twist, they set the film in Antarctica, the place you'd least expect to find a sandal clad, Tropical weather loving Predator. Then they make the make the film PG-13, which ultimately stifles the flow of the movie. It does not have the feel of the original films; it is more like the director says a ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" film; it was certainly designed for younger audiences. The worst element is the ""team up"" of the Predator and the heroine Sanaa Lathan. This concept, taken directly from the Aliens vs. Predator graphic novel, is done very poorly, turning the film into a ""buddy"" movie totally demystifying the Predator. All in all, this film is not what many people expected, but it is worlds better than its ""Dawson's Creek-esque"" sequel AVPR. I consider 1997's Alien Resurrection as the beginning of the end for the series, like a terminal illness, AVP is just the last breathe and heartbeat of the series, and the horrid AVPR is simply the final death rattle for the franchise.

(This is not true of the heroine, but that was to be expected, if the  picture was not to end on a downbeat note.)  The monster fights are pretty good, the humans are completely outclassed.

1562952,3,B00005JMZK,"Alien vs Predator opens with the assembled expedition crew meeting...George Bishop Weyland...not PETER Weyland, as in Prometheus. And this Weyland is played by Lance Hendriksen. So it would seem that AVP is setting up a backstory to explain who was the human prototype for Bishop the Android (actually a Replicant, but as the rights to that name are owned by the estate of Philip K. Dick and Warner Bros., you won't find the word Replicant used in a 20th Century Fox movie), who appears in Aliens and Alien Cubed (twice!), which is how writer/director David Fincher wanted the title of the film pronounced. The events in AVP take place in 2004, a date completely in conflict with the Prometheus/Alien timeline. First of all, Peter Weyland did not found the Weyland Corp. until after he ended his professional relationship with Eldon Tyrell and the Tyrell Corp. You can find the history connecting Blade Runner to Prometheus in the Special Features accompanying the Blu-ray edition of Prometheus, although one may have to buy the Blu-ray/3D edition to get all the supplemental connecting material.

Prometheus takes place near the end of the 21st century, and the events in the 4 Alien films take place throughout the 22nd century. So AVP is kinda one-of-a-kind, existing outside the series' timelines and storylines of the Alien movies.

I am also an Alien(s) and Predator(s) fan. It sounds corny and cheesy, AVP?, but it works for me. The premise that Predators hunt the Aliens as part of their trophy in attaining the status of super warrior is awesome! I love it. The Predators are so cool and the Aliens are knarly. Here's a short version of the plot: scientific team goes to Antartica to explore a strange pyramid found by satellite. They discover they are the bait in the Alien vs. Predator game. The rest is a slasher/alien horror (though not realy scary) movie. You are not cheering for the humans but for either the Aliens or the Predator. It's Team Predator vs Team Alien. This isn't a horror movie but a game night movie. The question is will the Predators win or will the Aliens win and take over the world? Who cares about the humans.

1563101,2,B00005JMZK,"Well, this movie was so incredibly bad & cheesy at the beginning w/horrible cliched acting & a crappy script that I stuck it out only because I'd paid for the silly thing.  Most of the CG was horrible & was stuff that even I can do better (my hobby is 3D graphics).  But I guess I'll give a marginal pass on the graphics since they were done in 1993 and CG was still a relatively new art form.  Roughly mid-way through this turkey, however, the action picked up & it was actually kind of fun watching this battle between the Predator & Alien.  Of course, none of it really made any sense since there were a bunch of Predators running about, but only one is shown doing this epic battle with the queen Alien thing.  And then there is the matter of the cheesy relationship between the black chick & the Predator.  Very smaltzy & horrifically awful; it's just so damn B-grade Hollywood in conception doing something like that; so typical; so predictable.  Still, as awful as it truly was, the battle scenes helped at least to partially make up for an incredibly lame movie; kind of like the old King Kong vs. Godzilla movies I watched as a kid.  Those were just as cheesy & silly as this one was; except that here you had the fun of lots of slimy stuff & acid spit with Alien vs. Predator. Of course, having the little baby Alien shoot out of the dead Predator's stomach at the end simply begged for a sequel.  I suppose if it turned out that this movie actually became popular, it would leave a nice lead-in to the next one in the series.  Hopefully, this particular Alien will simply & finally die a very fast death.  Having seen it, I never want to see it again.

But there is one part in the movie that completely ruined the whole thing and it's towards the end. After seeing that part, it makes the rest of the movie seem pointless. Because if that's what happened towards the end, why were we on edge and scared during the movie so much, I guess we really didn't have to be. I can't believe that they changed the Predator's attitude toward humans, that completely ruined the whole movie, what were they thinking, it looked so stupid and so off. However forgetting that, that part exists, the movie is ok, it's got some action, a lot of talking but it's interesting. I like movies set in Antarctica which is a mysterious place in in itself. It's worth watching, it's entertaining and who knows maybe you won't feel the way I felt about that part towards the end, maybe it'll even seen cool to you. And that's great because then it won't be ruined for you like it was for me. I just don't know what they were thinking in taking that route towards the end of the movie, the Predator is hardcore, he hates humans. If he can be our friend then why are we even scared of him. What's next, are we going to be friends with the Aliens next? seriously can you imagine seeing that on screen? It's ridiculous.

1563187,3,B00005JMZK,"Paul W.S. Anderson will never be mistaken for a true auteur. His filmography is littered with good-looking, albeit brainless, genre flicks like ""Resident Evil"" and ""Event Horizon"". Still, Anderson knows how to construct a stylish looking genre flick, and his B-movie expertise makes him perfect for ALIEN VS. PREDATOR, an enjoyable B-movie mash-up of the Alien and Predator franchises which isn't -- obviously -- on the level of Scott and Cameron's classics, but isn't but for what it is.

Granted, Anderson's film IS ridiculous, but after two tepid ""Alien"" sequels that each nearly ended that series -- not to mention a disappointing sequel that put a near- permanent hold on the ""Predator"" franchise -- the dumb comic-book action of ""Alien Vs. Predator"" comes as a somewhat refreshing surprise.

Not that the movie's routine first half will have you on the edge of your seat, however. Anderson and Shane Salerno's premise follows a group of present day archeologists and scientists -- hired by wealthy industrialist Charles Weyland (Lance Henriksen, playing the human forefather to Bishop) -- into the Antarctic where an ancient temple has been found beneath the ice. The group, which includes environmental expert Sanaa Lathan, uncovers a strange chamber where humans were used as ritual sacrifices for...well, without divulging all of the plot, let's just say that Aliens and Predators were somehow involved in the development of human civilization and big game hunting simultaneously.

""Alien Vs. Predator"" is not nearly as ambitious as ""Alien 3"" or ""Alien: Resurrection,"" yet it's more entertaining than both of those misguided flops (not to mention ""Predator 2""), particularly once the film hits its midway point. When the Predators and Aliens finally meet, Anderson's movie delivers the outlandish action and effects you'd anticipate coming from the premise, and rolls its way to the finish line surprisingly well.

Up until that point, the dialogue isn't especially interesting nor the scenario full of twists, yet I enjoyed the movie's visual design and special effects. Unlike the freakish make-up seen in ""Resurrection"" and the overall garish look of ""Alien 3,"" Anderson seems to have gone back to the drawing board and utilized the design of the creatures from James Cameron's superlative ""Aliens,"" in addition to H.R. Giger's original ""Alien"" conceptions, in establishing the look of the movie. There are also a few fleeting nods to those initial ""Alien"" movies (something that ought to please fans), but for the most part, ""Alien Vs. Predator"" stands on its own as an efficient, if unremarkable, late summer genre offering. The special effects are excellent and the final climactic battle between the Alien Queen, the Predator, and the last human standing is good, old-fashioned fun, well-edited and choreographed, and easily the best set piece of the ""Alien"" series since the conclusion of Cameron's 1986 hit.

Early in the film, one of the ""Wolf Man"" films is seen playing on a background TV. It's a telling reference, since ""Alien Vs. Predator"" is not a film with much on its mind other than providing its audience with an entertainment that couples two well-established monster franchises. In its own way, it's not all that different from ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" or any of the later Universal Monster team-ups from the mid '40s. It's a modern-day B-movie that knows what it is and provides a reasonably entertaining time for viewers who can approach it from the mind set that the material requires. (Now, if only Anderson had known when to quit and not tossed in that last groaner of a final shot!).

Fox's Blu-Ray is pretty solid for an early format release. The transfer holds up decently, and BOTH cuts (unrated and PG13) of the film are included along with two commentaries and a trivia track.",1337472000,3,3826,5.143086816720257

1563189,2,B00005JMZK,"After so many years of development hell, Fox FINALLY greenlighted one of the most anticipated ""versus""\sci-fi films and unfortunately, the result was a big disappointment.

Starting with the rejection of Peter Brigg's script (which was based on the Randy Stradley ""Aliens vs Predator"" Dark Horse comic series), Fox hired Paul W.S. Anderson (hack director\writer of Resident Evil, Soldier, Event Horizon, etc) to write\direct a new script, based on an idea he had, which basically, retains the Predators hunting Aliens, as a right of passage from the comic, but this time, the setting is in Antarctica, inside an underground pyramid that was co-built by Predators and an extinct Mayan race...following?

Charles Weyland (Lance Henrickson) creates a team of explorers, from around the world, and joins them to an expedtion in Antarctica to investigate a strange heat signature, under the ice, that one of his company sattelites picked up.

Sanaa Lathan plays Alexia Woods, an experienced mountain climber,  is the ""Ripley"" lead  and does a good job with her role. She is joined by a group of actors that are not well known, but do ok for the dialogue given.

As for the Predators, they are too bulky and muscular. They lumber around and barely resemble the fast, cunning hunters of past films.
The Predator helmet designs are neat, but the rest of the suit, including the extended-gaunlet blades look a little silly. The face of Scar (main Predator played by Ian Whyte), looks and moves differently than the creatures, from Predator 1 and 2 (this was a design choice by ADI to make Scar look more ""heroic"").

The Alien designs and suits were ok. A little too non-biomechanical, ""fleshy""-looking, but better than ""Alien Resurrection"", but the black\silver tones were a nice change, as opposed to the green\brown colors. I did like the lips quivering effect. Unfortunately, there were more CGI Aliens used in this film, than previous films (including the Queen and ""bullet-time"" facehuggers). There are still a lot of pratical effects, with CG enhancements, but showing the Aliens in full CG and in bright light, really takes away the scare-factor.

As for the battles, it was kind of exciting to see the two monsters fight, for the first time and it is a lengthy battle, but the way it's shot is not fun to watch. It seemed more like a bad wrestling match. The Alien kills two Predators (out of the three in the film) in less than 10 minutes! I'm sorry, but the Aliens are not THAT powerful.

There is a human\Predator alliance in the film (just like the comic) and surprisingly, I think it works and makes sense, given the situation. I can understand (and to a point, agree) with those that complain and oppose it, but these Predators are not hunting humans and only kill humans, if they pose a threat.

One of the absolute, worst mistakes that Fox\producers made, was the PG-13 rating! And it shows. Lack of human gore in THIS film is a joke (where's the blood on the chestbursters?). Sure, there's some violent scenes and blood-splatters, but it's not close to the other films.

As a big fan of both franchises, watching this film was a huge let-down. John Davis\Fox waited so long for the ""perfect"" script and THIS is what we get!? : \",1335052800,4,3236,4.844202898550725

By far the best alien characters of all time!!!!",1334275200,2,360,5.016666666666667
1563191,4,B00005JMZK,"I was myself surprised by how much I actually liked AVP, considering that it is very inferior to the founding films in both franchises and also to the Dark Horse original ""Aliens vs. Predator"" comics.

There is no doubt in my mind, that this film plays in an ENTIRELY different (lower) league than ""Alien"", ""Predator"" and ""Aliens"". To my personal taste it is also mostly on the same level of quality as ""Alien3"" and ""Predator 2"". On another hand it is definitely better than ""AVP 2"", ""Alien Resurrection"" and ""Predators"".

The possible future fusion of both franchises was first announced on the screen in ""Predator 2"" in 1990, in a short glimpse on the trophies wall in Predator's ship - amongst other memories of succesful hunts we could admire one huge adult xenomorph's (adult form of Alien creature) head. This promise was further confirmed in 1991 by the extraordinary Dark Horse comics ""Aliens vs. Predator"", which was in part an inspiration for AVP. ""Aliens vs. Predators"" comics met a considerable success in the following years, although none of them ever came even close to the quality of the first one.

It took however 13 years to produce a film in which both Aliens and Predators are present and this long wait didn't help the whole enterprise. The scenario adopted for this film was clearly not the best of solutions. Placing the action of AVP in Antarctica in present times broke the logics of both franchises. The aura of awe and horror surrounding the Aliens was in part created by the fact that they were a complete novelty for humanity - a completely new form of existence, absolutely unfamiliar, unheard off, in one word ALIEN. Placing them on Earth quite regularly since prehistoric times and suggest that images of some of the monsters in ancient temples were in fact traces of their presence on our planet, all of that ripped in shreds this particular shroud of terror in which they were wrapped. Also, putting Predators in Antarctica, was ludicrous, as it was stressed otherwise in both movies, that they are partial to heat and hunt on Earth only in the hottest spots, during the hottest summers...

All of that was already a HUGE mistake, but giving up on the best parts of the original comics was even worse! Replacing the character of Machiko Noguchi (colonial administrator of a distant planet) by Alexa Woods (guide for high mountain and polar expeditions) was a rather bad idea, but it had also its good points, for reasons which I will explain later. But changing the ending was a DEADLY SIN.

I can not go into details, in case if you didn't yet see the film or read the comics, but let's just be said that the final fate of Machiko Noguchi in the original comics is one of the best ideas I have seen in the whole SF - and it opens the gate to infinite possibilities for sequels full of wonderful adventures. But AVP closed this gate so thoroughly that I think the producer, the director and the scenarist simply CHICKENED OUT after seeing the sheer scale of future possibilities. I can not say anything more - read the comics and see the film and judge by yourself.

That being said, if we forget for a moment that AVP was supposed to be part of BOTH great franchises, it is not such a bad ""stand alone"" SF film and ultimately I rather liked it, for reasons which I will enumarate below, with limited SPOILERS:

1. Antarctica. This place of action gives to AVP a quite unique atmosphere, to such extent, that it is easy to forget that we are on our planet... The abandoned ""village"", where once whalers dwelled and worked, inspired clearly by the real life ""ghost town"" of Grytviken, is particularly well made.

2. The Great Pyramid of Predators. That gigantic structure is really well done and contributes a lot to the oppressive atmosphere dominating in the film. And the deadly surprises hidden in its mechanisms are also quite impressive.

3. Alien vs. Predator fights - VERY well done! The duel between ""Grid"" (a particularly big Alien ""soldier"") and one of the young Predators is actually the ONE scene which is as good as anything from ""Aliens"" or the first ""Predator"".

4. Lance Henriksen. It is a real pleasure to watch this actor in any movie in which he appears - and here, as Charles Bishop Weyland, the founder and CEO of Weyland Industries (which later, after a merger will become the infamous Weyland-Yutani), he is as good as Bishop the android in ""Aliens""

5. ""Scar"" Predator. The most gifted of the three young Predators who appear in the film is a very impressive creature and an imposing presence on the screen, quite a lot like the principal Predator in ""Aliens vs. Predators"" comics.

6. Last but not least, Sanaa Lathan. Cast as Alexa Woods, the principal character, she is the MAIN reason why I liked this film so much. Although her character was clearly inspired by Machiko Noguchi from the comics, Alexa is different, but definitely not one bit less interesting. Making her living by guiding expeditions in Himalayas, Arctic and Antarctica, respected in her profession, confident in her abilities and financially independent, she is completely in charge of her destiny and is definitely no damsel in distress. But, although very tough when needed, she is also a very feminine and warm person - and thanks to Sanaa Latham unique charm, this character is also very beautiful and sexy...

Also, what I liked very much in Alexa Woods is the calm, the self-control, a great dignity, all mixed with modest and gentle behaviour. When she needs to take charge, Alexa rules with an iron fist - but wrapped in a soft silk glove... Finally, she is also a lady, in the best meaning of this word - it takes two hours of all hell breaking lose and a hurricane of violence, death and suffering to finally force her to raise her voice and shout one obscenity!

And then, there are also scenes, in which Alexa meets one of the Predators face to face. Sanaa Latham played in those moments PERFECTLY! I believe that I have never seen in the cinema a more intense and more interesting meeting and interaction between a human and an alien intelligent creature. The scene in which Alexa receives a ""gift"" (well, sort of...) is particularly strong - and her acceptance of it is... well, no. I am not saying anything more - if you didn't see this film, you desserve to discover it by yourself.
---
CONCLUSION: if one manages to forget that this film is supposed to be a sequel in two franchises and succeeds to no less than three MASTERPIECES (""Alien"", ""Aliens"" and ""Predator""), AVP is a quite good SF movie, visually stunning and well interpreted. I simply can not help it - I LIKE IT!",1333324800,,6623,4.683576956147894

1563193,4,B00005JMZK,"I had to comment when I read that this reviewer spoke negatively about Ridley Scott's 'Alien'...not only is 'Alien' STILL the best of the bunch, with VERY colorful characters who all have their very own distinct personalities, but it also contains THE best looking set design, grandest scale and THE best looking Alien creature than ANY of the follow-ups (including Cameron's sequel). The entire atmosphere of 'Alien' is dark, brooding, creepy, and HUGE. From the opening credits, awesomely effective score, and build up upon finding the 'derelict craft'--THIS will always remain the 'standout' film in the franchise. NONE of the follow-ups could even attempt to shatter our senses and nerves when we did not know what was happening to Kane when the phalic steel-toothed serpentine 'chestburster' exploded from his chest! And Carlo Rambaldi's realization of H.R. Giger's designs was PHENOMENAL! The 'less is more' approach of quick cuts and slow reveal of the entire physical structure of the beast was also more intense in my book. As for Alien 3--this film was MUCH underrappreciated at the time of release...and anyone who has seen the 'Special Edition' 'work cut' will know how much BETTER this sequel COULD have been. The 'look' of the Alien in Part 3 was also bashed by 'G.X.'--which in MY opinion looked MUCH better than Cameron's 'Domeless' -'ALIENS!' When Jim decided to nix the translucent dome-the Aliens just LOST something. Kudos to Fincher for adding it back in! Cameron's 'Alien Queen' was fantastic-credit where credit is due--but aside from Ripley, Hicks, Paul Reiser's irritating company character, Hudson and Bishop--HIS film is LOADED with cardboard cutout characters with average acting abilities. And if Mr. X knows anything about the Aliens themselves-he'd realize the shape and speed of Fincher's Alien was due to the fact that the Aliens adapt to THEIR HOSTS. Being 'birthed' by a Rottweiler explains the lack of tubes, and the lengthened legs with dog-like feet-as well as the creatures SPEED. Cameron turning a SLOW MOVING chameleon-esque creature into a running, flipping, jumping acrobatic monster always had me wishing they'd stayed true to the original alien incarnation. the notion of an unstoppable creature that bled acid and had steel teeth with inner (again--chameleon-like) tongue with teeth that punched holes in your skull was a scary thought indeed. And as for the 'overly slimey' Aliens from 'Alien: Resurrection' (another great sequel that was panned mostly)--these aliens were not only the closest to Mr. Scott's ORIGINAL 'Alien'--but were the DIRECT influence for AVP's creatures! Not only that-but they were also created by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr,-the SAME guys who have done the Aliens since working for Stan Winston ('Aliens'), and who did the creature FX for ALL the sequels right up to 'AVP'...the WORST looking Aliens? By FAR 'AVP: Requiem'...overly 'snarly' lips, and dissproportioned heads--again WITHOUT the domes. While I DID also enjoy AVP: Requiem, it is by far THE worst plot in the series...let's call it Alien:90210...right down to the fake cardboard 'Ripley-off' soldier girl. The 'Brothers Strauss' seemed to only care about ripping off 'Aliens' as much as they could, teenage sex and as much splatter as they could get away with. And BTW--if the original 'Alien' was so 'flawed'--how do you explain the RETURN of Ridley Scott with 'Prometheus'??? Can you say RE-BOOT because the franchise NEEDS it more than ever? This 'prequel' which is MUCH more than just that-will bring us back to the 'derelict ship', explain a bit about that 'Space Jockey' species, and what the 'Alien' itself actually IS...biological weapon meant to exterminate mankind? It has already been hinted at that the Space jockeys have ALOT to do with the Human Race (as in 'Ancient Astronaut Theory'), and this WILL be a return to the grand scale of the first (and by far superior) ALIEN film! The only other director who attempted to bring back that claustrophobic, dark and nasty feel of Ridley's film was David Fincher-a director who has more than proven himself since Alien 3--right up to it's Nihlistic downer ending-the film WORKS. And finally, fans ARE accepting it!!! For now--lets' raise our glasses to the return of the MASTER-Ridley Scott and 'PROMETHEUS!'",1332460800,2,4306,5.197122302158274

1563257,4,B00005JMZK,"I wanna say this movie is great, but the PG-13 rating keeps all of the more intense action away from it. The story is about a woman (Sanaa Lathan) who was ordered by a very cool familiar character Charles (Bishop) Weyland to help lead his team of scientists, archeologists, and bodyguards into a pyramid. If anyone has seen the alien films (Alien and Aliens are the best in the series) then you may know that this movie is a prequel. It's before androids were created and Sigourney Weaver's character was around. So this movie basically explains a lot of info why the aliens and predators are fighting. The movie isn't that bad and if you take a look through the special features, the alien vs predator ""the making of"" really explains many facts about the movie showing the actors, the sets, and how it was made and much more things. The comic book gallery was also really helpful, yet you don't get to read any comics through digital pages though. They're just the front covers. Besides that the movie is interesting, but again lacks some action because its PG-13. Still great to watch in your collection though. The extended sections are ok and the deleted scenes are very little though. Im not gonna go over the commentary, or trailers/previews.

1563258,5,B00005JMZK,"This movie is far better than these reviews indicate.  I think expectations were too high when it first came out.  The lead female actress was fantastic, as was most of the cast.  The special effects were top notch.  The fight scenes were awesome!  They did stretch out how quickly the aliens are hatched and mature, it's true, but this I could easily forgive.  I have watched this flick about 7 times now, and I still enjoy it.  In my view, this film strengthens both the Predator and Alien series.  If you liked either/any of those movies, you will like this.",1284422400,10,561,4.54
1563259,2,B00005JMZK,"The title of my review obviously refers to the PG-13 rating that this bad-boy received when it was released.  Seriously, did anyone see that coming?  I was blown away, and I actually almost boycotted seeing the thing, but then again, who am I to judge before actually seeing the finished product.  After watching it I can say that it is a very weak attempt to capitalize on geeky fanboyism, and it's a shame because a lot of people were willing to shell out hard-earned (or at least their parents hard-earned) money to see two of the most iconic creatures in sci-fi history duke it out on the big screen.

Am I the only one who was bothered by the fact that there was like ONE Predator in this entire movie?

The film has its fair share of deliciously claustrophobic sets, and so I'll throw credit where credit is due.  It serves up some nicely manipulated chills and there are some jumpy moments and even some surprisingly edgy violent moments considering the rating (which is only one of the films hindrances) but overall the film cannot get out of its own way.  The script offers some interesting connective tissue when concerning the relationship between the two species of alien, but it also seems to dumb down nearly everything else until it becomes just another generic science fiction movie.

Run of the mill.

I will say this; I'm thankful that this film stars the magnificent Sanaa Lathan.  I seriously adore her in everything she does and will watch her in anything, even this half-baked creation.  She is just perfection on the screen.  Even while meandering through this films murky waters, she manages to make her presence believable and engaging.  If a lesser actress had been cast, this film would have fallen apart rapidly (see `The Ruins' for an example of poor acting destroying a mediocre film).

While I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie (in fact, I refuse to recommend it since it really doesn't need to be seen) I will say that if you happen to stumble onto it you won't be completely devastated.  It has some things going for it.  It's not a horribly bad movie, it's just a big disappointment.  Knowing what this movie could have been makes the experience so much less than rewarding.",1284422400,,2217,4.716883116883117
1563260,3,B00005JMZK,"The main difference between the Unrated and Theatrical edition of Alien vs Predator, are some deleted scenes, that are here to provide us more info about the characters, on the build-up first half of the film. Sadly, after that build-up, the film never fully delivers. It's like the characters (included the 3 different Predators) are already there to make us care for them, but ultimately the film never delivers in the tension it could have easily had.
Also, the deaths on this version are presented with added CGI blood, which as absurd as it sounds, works sort of well, since it feels nearer to a Predator or Alien flick than its theatrical PG-13 version. It never gets too gory here, and the deaths are as anti-climactic as in the original cut. No fights are added (as the back-cover announces), just those added character scenes. Anyway, if you're a fan of the franchise like me, picking up this DVD with such a great presentation and those few added elements will make you view this film as a more decent effort.  Avoid Aliens vs Predator: Requiem, which is insulting to most fans of the original films. This at least has great sets and and interesting story that could have been better explored with a more capable director.",1276041600,3,1232,4.730232558139535
1563261,3,B00005JMZK,"The first and most obvious thing you should know about AVP: Alien Vs Predator is that it's not going to win any Oscars nor does it want to.  This is a popcorn movie all the way through; 101 minutes of turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy entertainment.  Remember that going into this movie and you'll be a-okay.

With that out of the way, what is there left to say?  If you like Aliens and Predators or you just want to see the two duke it out, then go for it.  Of course my advice would be to rent the movie first to judge for yourself whether or not it's worth buying.  If you're buying the Blu-ray version, then you should know that both the Theatrical Version and Unrated Extended Version are on the same disc.  But be warned that, other than two Commentary tracks (for the Theatrical Version only) and a Trivia Track, there are no extras on the disc.  None.  Zero.  Nada.  There's no behind-the-scenes footage whatsoever, which is disappointing.  On the other hand, there's one Commentary in which Sanaa Lathan talks about ""flying vaginas"" so that's pretty interesting.  Or completely creepy.  You decide.

Anyway, that's all there is to this movie.  If you've seen Paul W.S. Anderson's previous films, such as Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil or his post-AVP masterpiece known as Death Race, then you pretty much know what to expect from AVP.  This is a movie that's all about plenty of mindless action that hopefully keeps your mind off of the weak story.  But hey, there's nothing wrong with that.  Every so often I like to sit back, relax, and watch a movie that doesn't try to make me care about anything other than how big an explosion is.  Okay, I did care about Lance Henriksen.

1563320,2,B00005JMZK,"* Some SPOILERS near the end of this review - if you can't guess the ending yourself*

I can't say I'm a huge, huge fan of either of the series this film brings together - though I was obviously intrigued enough to watch this, despite the generally poor reviews.  I liked PREDATOR well enough the last time I saw it - at least 15 years ago - but never bothered with the sequel.  I like both ALIEN and ALIENS quite a bit though my memory of the second is spotty; didn't much like the third film; never saw the fourth.  Both series strike me as fairly strongly predicated on the charisma of their stars, one reason I never bothered with the Arnie-free PREDATOR 2.  And charisma is one of the many, many things that are badly lacking in this mishmash of those two series' monsters, ""Chariots of the Gods"" and John Carpenter's THE THING (for it's Antarctic landscapes and attempts at creepy menace early on).

Basically, rich robotics guy Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen - yes, a tie-in with the future evil company, and with the character Bishop) finds a weird pyramid buried under the Antarctic ice and gets a team of archaeologists and mountaineer/arctic guide Alexa (Sanaa Latham) to go to the site, bore a hole down to the pyramid (thousands of feet), and explore.  Only someone has been there first, and soon it's a battle for survival with both buried, come-to-life aliens and the hunting predators from the stars wasting everybody in their way, including the hapless and weak humans.  And the presence of a Ripley or Dutch would sure have helped out here as the humans get butchered one by one and...we just don't care.

Not that lead actress and tough girl Lathan doesn't give it the old college try; problem is she's the only character that feels even the slightest bit real or interesting, everybody else including, sadly, Henriksen - whose character ought to have been better developed, given the imporance his ""descendent"" and company have in the later ALIEN films - is pretty much a piece of meat waiting to be carved up.  The only part of the film that really worked at all was the final chapter in which Alexa and one Predator have survived and make a wordless pact to defeat the aliens together.  This was kind of interesting, reminiscent of scenes in westerns or war movies with such grudging acceptance between two enemies united in a common cause, and Lathan and whoever was in the Predator suit did a good job with the physical communication and most of the action up until the finish.  It's this part of the film that gives the film a second star for me.

But on the whole, this is a boring, poorly written and very underdeveloped cash-in, with sets that just look like sets and action sequences that just don't cut it, because they're photographed so close-up that it's impossible to know what's going on.  I know that $60 million isn't an enormous budget for an action/science fiction film these days, but it's not tiny either and there are filmmakers that could do far more with it than Paul WS Anderson did.  And storywise we don't, up until the last bit that I mentioned, really have anybody to root for except for ""final girl"" and likely survivor Lexa (well - maybe - she's left on the ice alone and not dressed for it; seems like an unusually warm spell given how generally unprepared the crew was for the weather).  Had the revelations about the Predator-Alien relationship come earlier, had we gotten a little more of what the Predators were all about, some sense of their ""honor"" or whatever, it might have felt more intriguing.

As some others have noted, this is well-presented on DVD, with a boatload of extras that do make it seem that director Anderson is more than just a commercial hack - he has the geek sensibility that would seem to make him a good choice for a project like this.  On the basis of what he did here though, I wonder if that's all he's got, because wanting to make something as cool as the movies you grew up with isn't always enough.",1264809600,,3995,4.594936708860759
1563321,4,B00005JMZK,"set forth by dark horse comics. Dark Horse comics has done a lot of excellent comic series w/ very strong story lines. One of their best is about a group of people w/ some colonial marines who end up on a predator sporting planet training arena. Ultimately everyone ends up buying it except for one woman and a super tough predator, who honors the woman by marking her, making her in essence a honorary predator of sorts and also giving her a kind of elite status. The tough pred buys it, and when the pred buddies finally show up the woman boards the ship to go around and do the pred thing, they can't say no, she has the right by baptism of fire.

  this movie is based on that series, and does a great job in placing it in the modern earth setting. My only complaint is the incubation period of the aliens, which turned into minutes instead of a few days, and the woman does not board the pred ship.
  Some people did not like this movie because it does not go out to be a crowd pleaser, doesn't have the real happy hollywood ending that most card board mvoies of today made in the states have, but then again in my book that is another plus",1264636800,3,1145,4.210045662100456
1563322,5,B00005JMZK,"The concept at the core of the story, is clever. The visuals are excellent. I thought the movie was awesome as a whole but of coarse it wasn't perfect. If you are a fan and let yourself sit back and enjoy it, you will come away with a good experience.",1262044800,2,251,4.04
1563323,5,B00005JMZK,"When I first saw this movie in theaters I was a little bit disappointed after being a huge fan of the comics since the first series came out in 1990. The story in the comic took place in the future on a planet that the Weyland-Yutani company had colonized and a group of predators infested the planet with aliens which they later on went to hunt, unaware of that there were humans on the planet.
It was a great comic book, which if it was made in to a movie it would probably be the hit movie of the decade, but instead Fox and Paul WS Anderson wanted to go their own way and try something different. They kept elements from the comic, such as the chick who teams up with the predator and her earning the mark of a hunter, but besides that, there's nothing that's the same. Instead they made the movie a prequel to Alien and a sequel to Predator which involves Weyland industries finding a heat bloom in Antarctica which turns out to be a pyramid that Weyland and his scientists suspect to be built by the first civilization, which I actually thought was pretty cool. Anyway a group of Scientists, explorers and mercenaries join together to go check it out and they get a whole lot more then what they expected and the hunt begins.

The theatrical movie to me had quite a few plot holes and some things just didn't really make since like for instance, the very fast growth cycle of the aliens (which even with the directors cut, still doesn't really make any since), and the whole thing of it being PG-13 kind of dumbed it down a little too much for me at first. When I bought the movie on DVD later I appreciated it more, but still I wouldn't call it great. After I got to see the 8 minute longer Unrated Version, or Directors cut or what ever you want to call it, I appreciated it a whole lot more.
The unrated version has a little bit more blood and gore, but not that much though. Instead we get a whole lot more dialog in the movie and some scenes that just felt like it completed what was missing before.
Also I noticed that this movie is made to feel more like an Alien movie than a Predator movie. The movies first half is mostly dialog, while the second half is action and even though it doesn't take place in space, the beginning of this movie when the crew is on the ship getting ready to dock at Antarctica, kind of has the same feel of what Aliens had when the colonial marines are on the Sulaco getting ready to set down on LV-426.
Anyway, this is a great movie and being a fan of the comics for so long, this is what I've all ways wanted to see and AVP Unrated Edition works great and even though it's only 8 minutes longer, it still does the trick and is a lot better than the theatrical version.
There's also tons of special features and an exclusive AVP Comic Book is also included!

If you're a fan of Aliens or the Predator Franchise, I definitely recommend that you add this to your collection. If you didn't like the theatrical version, I still think you should give this one a shot and keep an open mind about it. If you don't like it for the fact that it's 2 universes combined with each other and if you're narrow minded about AVP in general, then this is movie not for you.

I give this movie 5 Stars (since so many try to trash this movie, I'm adding an extra star)
And I give the theatrical version 3 Stars",1260403200,2,3334,4.238993710691824

I buy it because of its entertainment value, not because the director once passed gas on the set or the cinematographer suffered from a case of severe acne.  This is a fun movie, filled with action, from the first moment to the last.  The sound is awesome, especially if you have a home theater set up, although it was really pretty good when I didn't have one.  If you are fan of the Alien flicks, or if you just like a rollicking roll of fun I can recommend this movie, even if one of the lead actors had a pimple.",1259020800,3,609,4.17948717948718
1563325,1,B00005JMZK,"I just want to start this off with saying, I LOVE the original Alien movies. So I was amped about this movie and really wanted to like it.

I'm pretty disappointed by this movie. The story is very thin/weak and the characters are dumb. When I say dumb I'm talking about the cheap horror movie dumb where the person running from the monster decides to run into the woods, in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere without a flashlight.  So they find an unknown heat signature and want to check it out, thats fair.  BUT when they see the hole that was dug overnight, and see that it blasted through one of the near by buildings that would be a red flag to me. If you look at the path the tunnel makes through the ground and through the building it means either the tunnel was dug from under ground and went up through the buildings, or it had to come from above the buildings (space). That would be a HUGE red flag, and I think I would cancel the whole trip right then and there. Either that or set up some remote surveillance type stuff and go home. But instead they go in looking for digging equipment.

You would think once they got down to the bottom of the hole and saw no equipment and no team of people they would want to turn around. Nope, lets go in!

Apart from that, the character development is very poor. Dialog poor. Action was shot at too tight, making it unintelligible. The CG was cheap and almost amateur looking. The lighting in the CG didn't match the lighting of the scene so whenever the movie would cut over to CG it really jumped out at you saying ""hey this is cg"". Also there is a scene where the helicopter is flying over the ocean in daylight and you can see a pattern in the waves of the water. Very cheap CG. I could go on and on but I'll stop here.",1257206400,,1787,4.183139534883721

Genre fans and Alien fans will not be dissapointed with AVP's special effects, action sequences, and thrills.  I particularly like AVP's art direction.  The abandoned whaling station and the Predator proving ground pyramid are both interesting places in which to enjoy the mayhem.  The effects team for AVP also, in my opinion, picked all the right places to use CG, puppets, or guys in costume.  Woodruff and his team should be proud of how seamless the those transitions happen in the picture.  The Blu-ray quality further helps AVP's strengths.
Finally, an implausible set-up, silly and sometimes embarrassing story concepts are not enough to keep me from really liking AVP.  I'm not at all afraid to admit that I'm there to see the fight.  The final battle featuring an escaped Queen alien, has an exciting and cool ""Godzilla versus"" feel.  AVP's Director/writer, Paul W.S. Anderson's latest work was on ""Pandorum.""

Some surprise moments and some thrills but not nearly enough and AVP is over way to fast. Everything in the film seems speeded up and suspense as a result is simply zero. Both the entire series of Alien movies and the first Predator film depended upon moments of silence to build up the suspense. (Nothing really happens at all of the first hour of Alien for example.)

This movie, on the other hand, moves so much like a video game you will be reaching for the controller. The Predators look okay but the Aliens are too cartoonish and seem to change size at random.

The plot and the back-story are simply inept. What is wrong with an alien Queen in the New York subway system or Predators fighting in Iraq? Heck putting them in an office block, cruise ship or shopping mall at Christmas would be preferable. (The Predators take out the Orange Julius while the Alien Queen makes her nest in Victoria Secret.)

Given today's angst-filled audience's hypercritical viewpoints on EVERYTHING, there are shows that could literally shine as works of Hollywood art, yet will probably be villified into obscurity.  AVP (Aliens versus Predator) may just be one such movie.

STORY-5 Stars
For any of you who are reading this review and haven't yet seen AVP, I give you fair warning that the next few paragraphs give away several spoilers and might hamper your enjoyment, so you might consider skipping over it to the next section.

The year is 2004.  Low Earth Orbit.  There's an object nearby, silhouetted in sunlight and coming closer.  Memories of another story come floating to the fore.  That shape...  so familiar...  is it...  a queen?  It passes under your field of view and you discover that, no, it's actually a satellite and the logo on the side identifies it as belonging to the Weyland corporation.  Floating high above the Antarctic, it notices something and decides to relay that information to the satellite tracking station.  The attendants check the data and find a heat bloom approximately 2000 feet underneath the ice.  Nothing at all should be there.  Curious...

Over the course of the next few days, a team is assembled from all over the world, including a guide, a drilling team, security and archeologists, to begin an expedition, led by CEO Weyland himself (played by Lance Henriksen), whose company is a pioneer in the field of robotics, to discover what exactly this potential prize is.  The only thing known about it is that it's a pyramid of gigantic size and the markings on it suggest it may have been constructed by the world's first civilized culture.  The job is rushed, against the advice of the guide, on the assumption that other companies are on their way as well, in an effort to be the first to stake a claim.

When they get there, they discover a path already made to the site that wasn't there the day before, set at a perfect 30 degree angle.  No one on the team understands how this can be, because there is no technology found on Earth that could possibly have dug to such a depth in that short a time.  The mystery deepens.

On site, they enter the pyramid and discover a sacrificial chamber, which heightens the brooding sense of uneasiness among the crew.  Something dark happened here in the past.  Further in, they uncover a sarcophagus bearing a lock based on the Long Count, the ancient Aztec calendar.  Inside, there are three objects that nobody can identify.  They look completely out of place, in that they appear much more advanced technologically than the surrounding architecture indicates they should be.  Removal of these objects initiates a periodic shifting of the pyramid's interior, cutting off the team members from each other, turning the search into a hunt for a way out to safety.  In addition, the team finds that they are now being hunted by two other species of creatures, neither of which are from this world.  And both of them are definitely hostile.

Over the course of the movie, it's discovered that the first species of extra-terrestrial, colloquially known as Predators, found Earth many thousands of years ago and taught humanity the rudiments of civilization.  In return, they demanded subjects to submit themselves to become hosts for the second species of creature.  These creatures were used as quarry for a hunt, which purpose was to usher in the Predator adolescents to adulthood; a rite of passage in order to be accepted as full members of their specific clan.  This pyramid was their ritual training ground, used for just that purpose.  In the event that the Aliens got out of control (a likely scenario given their instinctive aggressiveness; indeed sometimes it was hard to tell who was hunting who), the entire site was obliterated.

The Aliens end up getting out of control.

The guide (the last surviving human) ends up teaming up with the last surviving Predator and narrowly escape the destruction of the site just ahead of the blast wave.  Once outside, the human is marked with the symbol of the Predator's clan, thereby being accepted into it, and they cooperate to bring down the Queen Alien.  During the battle, the Predator is killed.  His corpse is brought onboard his clan's ship for his return to the homeworld and the human ends up going her own way, now ready for whatever the future will bring.

The last scene aboard the Predator's starship is that of the dead adolescent, lying on a slab next to a porthole looking out over the Earth.

He's at peace...

...and then his chest suddenly ruptures outward, exposing the head of a newborn Alien.  Segway into 'AVP: Requiem'.

End of Spoiler

This movie and its sequel came about because of a short scene in Predator 2, where Danny Glover's character, Los Angeles police detective Lt. Hardiman, entered a hidden Predator clan ship in search of a member of the clan which had butchered his entire squad.  On one wall, there hung several skulls; trophies of kills that clan had made.  One of the skulls was that of a warrior Alien.

I remember all of the hushed whispering that erupted when that scene showed in the theater and myself thinking ""Oh yeah!"".  Soon after, Dark Horse Comics starting running a series involving confrontations between the Predators and Aliens set in the future, when humanity had branched out to the local stars.  I knew then that something was going to come of that and wasn't at all surprised when AVP trailers started broadcasting during prime time tv.

And yes, when I saw this movie in theaters, I enjoyed it immensely.  Now that the extended cut has come out on DVD, I enjoy it even more.

This movie got a bad rap because 1.)Paul Anderson directed it and 2.) there weren't a lot of big-name actors starring in it.

I remind everyone that none of either the Alien or Predator movies starred first-tier actors when they originally aired (except for the very first Predator, and that one was touted as being a 'Schwarzenegger movie' typical of the style of 1980s shoot 'em up action films), yet all of those actors did first-rate jobs with the tasks they were given.  'Alien' was Ridley Scott's second directorial effort and 'Aliens' was also Jim Cameron's second time as a first-unit director.  'Alien 3' was David Fincher's first feature film after a bout of directing music videos.  The purpose for this was so that viewers would focus on the stories rather than who was in it.  They succeeded.  Despite the various negative reviews, each of the movies (depending on which one it was) has collected a cult following that's stood the test of time for the past thirty years.  This movie and its sequel allow both franchises to survive on their own, without having the fame factor of either Sigourney Weaver or Arnold Schwarzenegger propping them up, because the story behind each is bigger than either of the characters those two actors portray.

VISUALS-5 Stars
There may be some scenes in this movie that seem somewhat cliched, but these scenes are in there to remind folks exactly which background universe the story takes place in.  AVP also took the characters in the show and made them more than just faceless, nameless victims of the slaughter and I applaud the director for doing so.  Some people also decry the use of CGI in today's movies.  I hate to say it (well... no, not really), but CGI is here to stay.  Might as well get used to it.  I personally have no problems with it.  I remember the old way they used to do special effects, and the photorealistic CGI visuals look a LOT more natural in the scene.  The ones in this movie look awesome.  Ian Whyte, the actor portaying the main Predator, has gotten the movements of the creature down exactly.  I watch this and it reminds me of Kevin Peter Hall's movements in the original 1987 show starring Arnold.

SOUND-5 Stars
Sound in movies these days has only gotten better with digital clarity and the score and ambient effects in this show fit both franchises to the letter.

SPECIAL FEATURES-5 Stars
This DVD includes both the theatrical version and the unrated extended cut on disc 1.  The special features included on disc 2 are pretty meaty and detail the production of this movie from start to finish.  It also shows the comic series AVP is based on from Dark Horse, the 'Monsters in Miniature by Todd McFarlane' featurette and the AVP HBO special.

OVERALL-5 Stars
Despite what many might say, I feel that this IS a worthy addition to both the Alien and the Predator backdrops.  It shows us that we may not actually be alone in this universe and what we come across out there might not be that friendly.  Prepare yourselves for what you may find.

1563405,1,B00005JMZK,"My DVD of this film is stated to be 108 minutes in duration. This Blu-ray release is stated to be 101 minutes long.  If these are accurate, what a rip-off!",1245283200,,155,4.166666666666667
1563406,4,B00005JMZK,"Like most people, I always liked the Alien movies. In fact, the original Alien movie is probably the only horror movie that really scared the living day lights out of me! Even when I saw it a second time (with annoying commercial breaks), it still scared me. Later, I learned that the alien monster or ""xenomorph"" was originally designed by a Swiss surrealist painter with an interest in psychoanalysis, H.R. Giger. Perhaps that's why the monster is so scary. Clearly, Giger and the rest of the production team have tapped into our worst nightmares and subconscious fears.

I liked the Predator movies as well, so the concept of a crossover had a certain appeal.

I know that the critics dissed ""Alien vs. Predator"", and apparently many hard-line Alien fans didn't like it either. In my opinion, however, ""Alien vs. Predator"" is an underrated movie. It could have been much worse! Sure, it's not as good as the real Alien movies, but it's perfectly acceptable. If you like constant action, monsters, and a little bit of science fiction, that is!

What's missing from the crossover movie is that special magic touch that made the original Alien movies so memorable. The characters aren't very interesting either, not even the main hero Alexa Woods. Also, the continuity between ""Alien vs. Predator"" and the other Alien or Predator movies isn't very clear. While this will no doubt annoy the most devoted fans, I don't think the regular viewer will mind. I certainly didn't when I saw the movie on Swedish TV just the other day! Once the action gets started, and the bizarre aliens and predators start fighting each other, with the humans stuck in between, you tend to forget that it's not ""really"" an Alien movie.

The plot of ""Alien vs. Predator"" is quite simple. A research team discovers an underground pyramid in the Antarctica. The pyramid was built by a previously unknown civilization, combining traits of the Aztecs, Egyptians and Cambodians. It's all bunk, of course. My father (who was watching the movie with me) kindly informed me that the Aztecs didn't have the kind of calendar depicted in the movie. Those were the Mayans! I kindly informed him that the Egyptians, of course, never practiced human sacrifice...

Then, the fun begins. It turns out that the pyramid is used by the ""hunters"" from the Predator movies for initiation rituals. The young hunters must prove their worth by fighting ""the snakes"", which turn out to be the Alien monsters. Unfortunately, the Aliens need to kill other life forms to reproduce (they are parasites). For that purpose, humans are fooled into the sacrificial chamber of the temple, only to be infected and killed by Alien ""facehuggers"". When the mature Aliens burst out of the dead human bodies, the hunt can begin! Of course, something goes terrible wrong, the captive Alien Queen escapes, and soon it's not so clear who is the hunter and who is the hunted... The female hero, Alexa, is forced to co-operate with an Alien-infected Predator to stop the Alien Queen from reaching the surface. Meanwhile, the Predator space ship plans to ""drop the big one"" in case they fail.

The fate of human civilization hangs in the balance...

The best movie around? Hardly. A worthy prequel to the really real Alien movies? Probably not. But as Friday night entertainment goes, I'd say it's about as good as it can get. FOUR STARS.",1235174400,,3368,4.867364746945899
1563407,4,B00005JMZK,"Blu Ray review:

The Biggest thing about this BD of AVP that is consistently not mentioned is that the BD contains BOTH the PG-13 theatrical cut AND the unrated directors cut of the film. Amazon only lists the disc as the PG-13 version, and even an external BD review site failed to mention the inclusion of the unrated cut. So if you've wanted to get AVP on BD and haven't due to a lack of the unrated cut, fear not, it's on the disc.

Video quality is good. It's not the best picture I've seen, but it's nowhere near the worst. Definitely better than the DVD 4/5 overall

Sound is good as well. Just like video, it's not the best, but it's not the worst. Choices are DTS-HD 5.1 (4-4.6 mbps) in English. French and Spanish in Regular Dolby Digital 5.1 (not HD audio).  Overall a 4/5 for the DTS-HD track.

This review isn't about the movie itself, nor is it meant to be all-inclusive. My main reason for writing the review is that the unrated cut isn't advertised by anyone it seems in regards to being on the BD version and that is a big deal to me.

1563410,3,B00005JMZK,"In spite of its manifold flaws, AvP managed to be fairly entertaining. The characters were all pretty flat, the acting was horrible, and all but one of the humans dies without putting up any kind of meaningful fight whatsoever. The premise is totally absurd. The movie is basically entirely lacking in subtlety or depth. But for all that, I have to admit to having taken a great deal of rather juvenile satisfaction in watching the Predators and the Aliens-- two of the baddest beasts ever to hit the silver screen-- tear each other to shreds. Plus, once the main human character hooks up with the Predator to help him do battle, she turns out to be pretty cool, too. This is definitely about as mindless as action flicks come.

1563411,4,B00005JMZK,"This film definitely benefits from retrospect. After having viewed it now several times I've come down on the side of the fans with this film and not on the side of the haters, of which there are many.

When this movie was reported on, most of the mainstream press dismissed it outright as either an over the top combination, too niche of an audience, a bad idea that could ruin both franchises, and so on. After the initial shock wave settled and the movie came out, the box office numbers were pretty dismal and the film was then seen to have under-preformed. The expectation was probably too great to live up to or even meet half-way. Aliens vs. Predator landed with a thud in the theatres as well as on DVD when it was finally released.

But with all due respect, the film is greater than it's marketing history and will probably be seen as such in time to come.

The story has some surprising elements to it. Lance Henriksen being one of them, playing Charles 'Bishop' Weyland of ... ahem ...Weyland Industries. Yes, now it all makes sense. The whole question of Bishop wants to be answered and is begging to be answered in this film, much like the Terminator Series tries to reverse engineer their own on-screen technology to show you its roots. Henrikson's character is a billionaire industrialist that does it all and has the jump on most modern governments and not-surprisingly more armed than modern governments as well. But in this film, he's the aging, decrepit and frail leader that probably should've stayed home but takes no advice.

Overall, the action is good, the story is well-written and engaging. The CG is  flawless and one can tell that a lot of love went into his movie from the inception of the idea and followed it all the way through the process. This is a much better movie than it was given credit for, and AVP holds it own in the world of both Predators and Aliens.

And for the record, if you have any doubts at all, this film also looks a million times better once you get a whiff of AVP:R, which was a complete and unmitigated disaster. It's a shame that movie was even made, because AVP:R did what everyone thought this film was going to do to both franchises. It just goes to show how much hard work is required to carry off something of the magnitude achieved in this film. Making a naval gazing, teen slasher movie and trying to pass it off as either an Aliens or Predator production is just downright shameful.

Well, as of this date AVP3 is silently in the works and it looks as though AVP:R is just going to be outright ignored in the storyline, and should be. Hopefully AVP3 will pick off where AVP left off.

Only sometimes things don't work out as planned, and if Aliens are produced in numbers too overwhelming for the Predators to handle, they instigate their own 'final solution'. Evidently no remains of any kind of Alien are left behind, because in ALIEN, the comment is made that, ""we've never encountered any species like that on LD-486, or any other planet [to Ripley]"".

1563514,5,B00005JMZK,"Before this film even existed I was never familiar that there was a whole universe of Alien vs Predator type stuff like comics, games etc so I was quite shocked that they made this movie and felt it would simply be another vs movie much like Freddy vs Jason. In a way it became what I expected it to be but with a little more on top, it was disappointing yet enjoyable at the same time. The major tag line for the movie was ""Whoever wins, We lose"" which when you watch this film you come to learn that actually that's not strictly true. The story is about a team of Archeologists who discover that there may be an ancient Aztec temple 2,000 feet under the Antarctic ice and they want to go on an expedition to explore this temple, however they find themselves in the middle of an even greater problem, a war between Alien species.

This wasn't a reflection of what you would expect from a typical Alien or Predator movie as there is very little blood and guts and little genuine horror. We are given, however, a more human look at the Predators as we come to learn that them being on our planet is simply a hunt and they don't injure or maim those who are un-armed. To those familiar with the comics or graphic novels of the AVP series this may be a regular thing to see but to those who are just familiar with both sets of movies, this is a surprising dimension to be given to the Predators.

I love movies and appreciate great works of art in film. I also am not above loving a good popcorn flick!

This gimmick is no different than what was done in the 40's when classic films like 'Frankenstein' and 'The Bride Of Frankenstein' had sequels like 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman'! Although it's not a classic, it's still a memorable and fun movie.

These films don't destroy what was great about the classic, they actually pay great respect...a homage if you will to the original.

1563518,4,B00005JMZK,"Alien vs Predator is a science fiction film, made in 2004, that bring the two beloved sci-fi franchises of fans all over together. It was a concept that was brought together in a comic series of the same name in 1989. Directed by W.S. Anderson(best known for ""Event Horizon""& ""Mortal Kombat""), it stars Sanaa Lathan, Lance Henriksen, Raoul Bova, and Colin Salmon. Alien vs. Predator follows a group assembled by billionaire Charles 'Bishop' Weyland (Lance Henriksen) for an expedition near the Antarctic after discovering a mysterious heat signal. Hoping to claim the find for himself, Weyland and the group discover a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station. Little do they know that it is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a part of ""coming of age"" ritual. Despite harsh critism about the movie from movie reviewers and fans alike, it did well at the box-office ranking 33rd over all for the year as the highest-grossing film of that year. It has also did well by DVD sales and whatnot. In my opinion, AVP is a fun romp definitely worth owning just to see my two favorite space lifeforms duking it out til the end. It's a heck of a sight better than ""Freddy vs Jason""(I truly mean that, I'm afraid). The unrated edition contains the special features from the Extreme Edition, CGI and an extra eight minutes of footage. That goes a long way in making  the movie that much better. So, regardless of what you hear about it, check out AVP:Alien vs Predator. It's a really good movie.",1208304000,,1504,4.696969696969697

Predator is poised to be a star, Hollywood just seems reluctant to give him a great script so he can show what he can really do.

Predator is one of the best movie monster creations in quite some time.

He ranks up there with Dracula, Werewolf and the Mummy in cinema history.

Not just because of his awesome physical design, but also his movie history.

The Predator is one of the few baddies to go toe to toe with one of the greatest action

movie heroes,  Arnold Schrwazannerger.  If you dislike one of Arnold's movies

its partially because the villian is no match for Arnold.

However we all know what a great job Predator did against Dutch in the first Predator movie.

The director did a great job of giving the Predators a favorable persona.  You have the more experienced fighter, and a over confident noob among others. But then just when you really start to like a Predator, he gets killed off.

I would have rather seen a group of the ""Star"" Predators go up against the Alien Queen in the end, instead of the dreadful ending this movie has.

Not a bad A vs P movie, but it should have been ALOT better.",1208044800,,1320,5.050925925925926

1563521,4,B00005JMZK,"The Good Things
*Cool special effects and some good, memorable action scenes.
*The settings are very nifty.  Good production design all around.
*The Predators get to use most all of the great weapons introduced in previous films.  The Aliens exhibit the same unnatural intelligence (or instinct) as in the previous films.  This film also introduces some interesting, logical ideas (like how the Alien skeleton is acid-proof, or how the Aliens willingly kill themselves to free their queen...).
*Even though it seems a little silly, I thought it was cool to see the Predator bonding with the main character.
*Very fascinating story line that ties the two franchises together brilliantly (and still corresponds well to the original films).

The Bad Things
*Not much blood or guts, which is truly unsual for an Alien or Predator film.  The unrated version has a little more, but is stil not much.
*Kind of boring for the first hour.
*Despite the interesting backstory, the movie itself reminds me of the other films made by this director (like ""Event Horizon"" or ""Resident Evil,"" all of which showed the same spiel about a bunch of people who explore a dark place and encounter something scary).
*Most of the characters are dull.  They tried to develop them to an extent, but they are ultimately unmemorable.

It took me a few viewings to truly appreciate this.  I really don't care much for the characters (even the main character), and most wind up dying anyway.  And when the film spends the first hour developing these boring characters, the film as a whole seems very tedious.  But, the second half is very cool; there are lots of great fight scenes and slick special effects.  I was largely impressed by the backstory that tied the Alien and Predator together.  While this hardly compares to the other Alien or Predator films, this is pretty fun.  Fans of either franchise should probably see this at least once.",1207180800,2,1915,4.891640866873065

Walking into the film I thought I'd get the same feeling I got the previous summer when I saw Freddy Vs. Jason, and while AvP does has some cool action sequences it could have been so much better. Sanna Lathan was good as always while the rest of the actors seemed as if they were there just for a pay check. As for the sequel well let's just say it's a slight improvement.",1206403200,,494,4.103092783505154
1563592,2,B00005JMZK,"This is a great DVD transfer of the non-stop special effects of Alien vs Predator (AVP). Enjoying even the great special effects of this film isn't enough to make for a really memorable sci-fi experience as it takes an engaging plot to make a good film, even in science-fiction.

I don't believe anyone would think of this movie as part of the Alien series or try to compare it with prior Alien films. It obviously represents a ""knock off"" intended to attract from a large number of satisfied customers of the Alien vs Predator magazines. This doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered good sci-fi film and I purchased the DVD hoping for a satisfying film experience.

The story line does a nice job of connecting the film histories of the Alien and Predator races together and linking these two fictional accounts with the history of man on earth in a plausible way. Most people agree that the history of ancient monuments all over the earth appear to have a common link, which is probably one of the sources of the Atlantis myth.

If anything I think AVP attempted to recapture the action and line up of good characters from ALIENS. Also, rather than the one-on-one bug hunt of the original film, this movie was about war between a defacto army of humans against an army of Alien creatures and their very dangerous Queen.

In terms of special effects I would give this movie four stars, however, I couldn't get all that interested in the basic story and AVP left me with an overall one to two star impression and the feeling I was watching an animated comic book.

I must admit that I never had the large screen theater experience and first saw the film on DVD at home. I assumed I would at least like AVP since I own the entire Alien series on DVD and enjoy seeing every one of them over and over again.

I thought the basic plot idea was a rather well thought out story, and for the first hour the film maintained a decent level of interest and even a little bit of characterisation.

It was certainly nice to Lance Henriksen back playing Charles Bishop Weyland - a nod to Bishop the android in Aliens. Sanaa Lathan is also pretty good as Alexa (effectively the Ripley role) but you would have thought that they could have come up with something slightly more original than creating another Ripley like character. It did become a bit predictable in the second half of the film and there are some noteable plot holes that can't be explained away.

If one has watched any previous 'Predator' movie, (and who would watch this if they hadn't), then we already know that a point is made of the 'Predators' preferring the ""hottest summers"". AvP gets a rating of '1' for the background sets and props...that's it.",1200614400,,362,5.05
1563597,3,B00005JMZK,"I've only recently just finished watching the Alien movies, and although I watched the Predator movies, I was never that fussed about them. If I had to choose one, I'd have to say I preferred the Alien movies to the Predator.

So I was shocked after watching AVP, that I actually found myself sympathising with the Predators!!!

There seems to be no relation to the other movies, Sigourney Weaver famously refused to have anything to do with it, so it was left for a below-standard movie to come onto our screens, without any backing from one of the original stars. Surely that's got to be a bad thing?

The storyline was a bit iffy, and the characters weren't that particularly likable. They never are in these movies, cos there's more money thrown at the special effects than developing the character storylines. But not to worry, that's the only major letdown, and it's to be expected.

What always got me about the Alien movies, and especially the Predator movies, is that you never really saw the aliens/predators that much. In this film, they're shown too much. When they're not shown as much (particularly the Predator, who was mostly invisible in the original movies), it gives the audience a sense of anticipation, of fear etc.

For this, like that other 'vs' movie - Freddy vs Jason - there should have been lots of alien vs predator fights. There's barely anything. One at the most. I can understand why some die hard fans were a bit miffed at that. If I'd been a die hard fan, I wouldn't have wanted to watch a few characters run around a pyramid, just asking to be killed.

But by the end of the movie, if you don't feel sorry for the Predators (looking bigger, better, and badder than their previous outings), then you have no heart. I actually found myself thinking ""awwwwww"", without hopefully not giving too much away about the finale.

There's already a sequel about to come out in the UK this month, which I'm not sure about. True, the first does just BEG for a sequel, but was it necessary? I'm sure I'll find out soon enough. Personally, they should have either made another Aliens movie (although I think Resurrection was final enough), or made another Predator movie (and brought back Arnie!), and left this well alone.

If I do see the sequel, I know who I'm rooting for. Go boy, go!",1200355200,,2307,4.623471882640587
1563598,4,B00005JMZK,"I purchased this DVD for my brother as a Christmas gift after he saw mine and like it.  FOX HOME VIDEO had released a previous version, a theatrical edition, of this film on DVD first - and this one seems to have been cancelled.  It's annoying really that the studios wait about 6 months to release a longer edition of the film after a first release.  It takes advantage of the consumer.  Now I wait for an extended edition instead of rushing out a buying what is first released.
The quality of this release is very good and the bonus materials are extremely well done.  My only complaint is with the director of the film tinting so much of the film in a dull blue.  The behind scenes footage and the trailer show what the film would have looked like prior to the tinting process.  Costumes, skin tones and sets look so much better prior to the tinting.  This is not just with this film but with many that are produced today.  No one seems to know good cinematography anymore.
Fans of the Alien series, and Predator, I think will like this rather tame and clean addition to the series with the added footage in this edition.  Get it before it disappears completely.  My order was filled and sent to me extremely fast - especially since it was during the Christmas shopping season which could have slowed down the shipping processess.",1200268800,,1333,4.4896265560165975

1563600,3,B00005JMZK,"I'll start off by saying this wasn't a terrible movie, but it's problem is that it delivers very little, especially from two franchises that have given so much.  What is odd is that any of the prior Alien or Predator films each had more action that AVP.  And you have to admit, there is only so much you can do with a story for this kind of film, so it all comes down to the action.  That's what we want to see the most - great Alien vs Predator battles.  Be warned now, there are really only two honest battles in the whole film between the two species.

Does the story make sense compared to what has happened with the other franchises?  Not really. So if you are hardcore about the franchises and appreciate continuity, AVP doesn't make too much sense.  Predator took place in 1987 and 1997 (keep in mind Predator 2 was made in 1990 but took place in 97).  Neither of those encounters were mentioned, only that the Predators came to Earth centuries ago.  As for the Aliens, we shouldn't really know about them until a long while from now according to the first Alien movies.  Maybe in future installments of the franchise (if it happens) something will come about to make the connections.

I was not impressed with any of the characters in the film, except maybe Weyland.  Played by Lance Henrikson, who also played in Aliens and Alien 3 as the robot ""Bishop"".  There is a connection from the robot to this guy in AVP, but its never quite explained.  The rest of the crew is lifeless, and serve very little purpose except as bait.

So it comes down to the creatures.  What there is is great, but it needed more.  It takes one hour out of the hour and forty minutes for the first fight to begin, which was a fun duel and a surprising outcome.  The Alien queen made it into the film, which I felt was a welcome return from Aliens and Alien Resurrection.  This is the 2nd and final battle of the film, when she goes up against the main Predator outside in the snow and ice.  The Predators looked great and tough as ever, but more clean cut this time around and not so rugged as the originals.  The aliens were CGI for the most part, and lacked the fright they presented in the earlier films too.  The humans - kinda just get in the way, but serve to tell the story - such as it is.

Considering how many years it took, and a dream come true that this film was even made, its still worth watching to those who are dying to see some kind of matchup between these two great creatures.  Chances are you expected more, but I guess that's what AVPR is for.

1563670,2,B00005JMZK,"A greatly disappointing 5th film in the Alien franchise (also the third in the Predator series), Alien Vs Predator makes a mockery of the intense and ruthless alien creatures defined in the films Alien and Predator. Far from the macabre masterpieces of the original films, this mishmash of comic book lore and subplots is an insult to the viewer and an insult to Ridley Scott and James Cameron.

A group of scientists and adventurers are pawns in a diabolical ""right of passage"" when they are sent to the depths of Antarctica to explore an ancient pyramid. Gathered together by industrialist billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) and lead by survivalist Alexa Woods (Sanaa Latham), the unsuspecting group ventures into an icy trap. Predators purposefully lure pray for alien eggs so that they can duel within the labyrinthine corridors of the icy monolith. What follows are some of the mildest scenes of action and alien violence imaginable.

One by one the human fodder is ushered into lonesome passageways and claustrophobic tunnels to meet offscreen demises that we can only assume are horrendous. A spattering of action sequences is well-choreographed and at rare moments I sometimes am able to ignore the shape of a man in a rubber suit. But when predators swing aliens around their heads like lassos, it's easy to forget that either creature could actually exist in the nightmarish premises once imagined by surrealist H.R. Giger and visionary director Ridley Scott.

Reduced to mere PG-13 frolicking animals, both the Aliens and Predators have never been so un-scary and un-cool. Even the Alien Queen is nothing more than a rip-off of Jurassic Park's T-Rex. It seems that even after Sigourney Weaver finally gave up the lead role resolutely, the copyright holders wished to capitalize on pre-sold audiences. When will it all end? Probably never, considering Alien Vs Predator 2 will be released Christmas 2007. While the plotlines continued to diminish after Cameron's original sequel, I never expected the once horrifying and bloodthirsty creatures to clash in overly bland battles diluted by the decision to purge all forms of mature content. Director Paul W.S. Anderson is surprisingly timid with such influences, considering his repertoire contains harsher fare like Soldier and Event Horizon. Despite outstanding computer animation and practical special effects, the Aliens and Predators have never looked so ridiculously harmless.

Before I begin, I just want to say that I really, really, REALLY wanted this to be a great film, I mean, SERIOUSLY!!! The original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite films of all time, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator/dp/B000244EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator</a>&nbsp;was pretty damn good as well!

I've never read the AvP comics, but when I heard about HOW they were going to bring the two species together for the film, well, I thought they had a winner on their hands!

Sure, like WHY is there a pyramid buried under the Antarctic? No one would have been able to reach it at ALL except in the last 100yrs or so! And oh yeah, 'til ""Bishop"" started his satellite spinning around up there in orbit to see the heat signature which would bring the Humans, who are a vital ingredient in the process after all... you see where this is going I'm sure, but I could let that slide, I guess. I just had to keep repeating to myself, ""Stop analyzing, stop analyzing, stop analyzing...""

The initial set-up was well handled - it's always nice to see Lance Henriksen doing his thing - and even though you know the majority of the characters are gonna be bug-meat in very short order, they sketch them out serviceably all the same.

We get to see the Predators in orbit preparing for the hunt - Cool! - then the poor unsuspecting humans enter the Pyramid and start messing with stuff you and I just KNOW they shouldn't be messing with! All of a sudden, the pyramid is activated, and we see the captive Alien Queen brought out of suspended animation to lay the eggs of a new generation of homicidal Drones - so freaking cool I thought I was gonna have to change my underwear!!!

And at that point my friends, things start to go down hill... fast.

In the original films, the Alien gestation/birthing process is given to us in all its horrific glory; from Face-Hugger, to Chest-Burster, to fully matured Drone/Soldier, takes at least a couple of days, here, the whole process is telescoped into just a few hours!

The other thing we know about the Alien's from the original films is that they bleed acid, right?! Well... maybe, kinda-sorta... it all depends. As the Predators face off against the Aliens they slice 'n' dice 'em, up close 'n' very personal, with a variety of weapons; sometimes they bleed acid... sometimes they don't.

For instance, there's one scene where an Alien has the end of its tail cut off, and it deliberately whips its severed member at its attacker, splashing him with acid. Then a short while later a Drone has his head sliced in two, and guess what? The head slowly slides apart, revealing nicely detailed interior, but no acid... it should have been spraying all over the place!!! And then there are the Predator weapons; sometimes they're damaged by the acid blood, and guess what, sometimes they're not!

This film so thoroughly ignores or distorts the accepted mythology of the Alien universe that it makes nonsense of the original films.

Henriksens character is ""Charles Bishop Weyland;"" ""The Company,"" in the original Alien films is the ""Weyland-Yutani Corporation."" Logically, therefore, The Company is a descendant of Weyland's operation in the here and now, so surely there would have some information in the company archives of the installation under the Antarctic ice? Wouldn't the sole survivor of the expedition tell her corporate backers the incredible tale of two Alien races fighting to the death in the pyramid?! And although the structure is taken out by one of the Predator mini-nukes, the Queen is, let's say... salvageable. Wouldn't The Company go back to the Antarctic in an attempt to recover Alien samples, instead of trawling through the vast and inhospitable reaches of space?!?!?!

And what about this; the Predators hunt the Aliens as a rite of passage. So, they've faced the most vicious and ferocious creature in the Universe, and are now Adults/Warriors - sorry, I never did get into the Predator mythology. But in the first two Predator films we see them hunting HUMANS; to a Predator, this has got to be the equivalent of those big, tough ""hunters"" who go to deer farms and shoot tame deer!!! Or maybe these Predators are the equivalent of juvenile delinquents; they've stolen the keys to daddy's starship, and are off causing trouble in the local galaxies?!?!?!

Yes I know, nit-pick nit-pick nit-pick!!! But these are such fundamental errors that they really are inexcusable.

But there is some good; the Predators look as menacing as they did in their own films, the Alien's look fantastic - these are Gigers originals, with the ""stove-pipes"" on their backs - and the Queen is amazingly rendered!!! One improvement they've been able to make is that the Alien's tails can now be made to work in a way that simply wasn't possible in the original films. There's a nice sub-plot concerning the surviving Predator taking the surviving Human under his wing, when she proves that she too is a ""Hunter,"" plus an explanation of how the Predators were worshiped as Gods by the ancient, pyramid building peoples of Earth.

This PG-13(!) rated effort is a shambles, especially if you're a fan of the original stories, and Henriksens character is thrown away quite unnecessarily early on in the initial encounters.",1196553600,2,5652,4.997872340425532

Well, except for the memorable part, and well the epic part, and I guess the ""live forever"" part, and the heart part (even though this film might create some heart attacks), and maybe even the ""fans"" part.

Lets face it, the only reason this movie sucked was because of it's beyond terrible ending. The first 2/3s of the film were actually pretty good (despite the lack of originality). then came the last 1/3, and oh man was that awful, okay first of all, after it killed half her team the main character decided to ""make friends"" with the twisted bloddthirsty Predator (E.T. anyone?). Then for some reason beyond me, the Predator decides to give her the mark of a ""true warrior"" or something corny like that (even though she didn't do a thing except say ""F---"" twice and shoot an alien the Predator could have easily killed himself). Speaking of the aliens, why were they so pathetic? I mean they were beyond weak, only one character was killed by the full grown aliens, all the rest were either killed by predators or face-huggers. Also, the film was completely derivitive of the film it spun off of ""Aliens"" The plot ended up being virtually the same thing (just with archeologists instead of marines).

The only people who will be pleased by this are 9 year olds and ""love 'em no matter what"" predator fans (the majority of predator fans will not be pleased and alien fans will not be pleased what-so-ever).

Watch with caution.

Add that to the fact that action is without intensity and the horror is non-existent, compounded by the shoddy special effects, and you have possibly the worst movie made since the turn of the century. The fact that this is rated PG-13 alone tells you enough. Suffice it to say, if you watch this and expect to get anything out if it, the joke's on you.",1194307200,7,1413,4.611111111111111

Sound is off the chart and explosive! 5 stars on PQ and sound. There is a stronger element of fun in this movie as the fear factor is toned down compared to Alien, Aliens.

1563795,2,B00005JMZK,"Well before I say anything specific about this film I have to tell about my experience with the Alien and Predator movies - I love them. I am not a diehard fan of either specie because I love and adore each one of them in a special way. With this said, I was looking forward to see AVP where I could see (as I believed) the two species go into a battle and one of them coming out on top.

Apparently, this was nothing more but a human survivalist movie. The director of the movie expected us to worry about the humans and not the species. In fact, he tried to produce a silly plot where we are supposed to get involved with the characters and feel sad when they die. The scene of someone showing pictures of the kids is just ridiculous.

Here's what's wrong with the movie. The title states ""Alien Versus Predator"" which means it should be about two species fighting each other with some random marines around. This is NOT what AVP is about. It has a specific group which specifically goes to research a pyramid in Antarctica where apparently the Alien Queen has been frozen way before Jesus was born. Humans worshipped the Predators (?) and sacrificed themselves for the so-called duck hunt where the Predator youth tries to survive the Alien assault. Yes, its as bad as it sounds. Even worse.

First of all, in original Alien movies, didn't they find Alien eggs somewhere deep in spaces, far away from Earth with eternal darkness? Well apparently Ripley didn't know that there is an Alien Zoo right in Antarctica. Another thing, I thought Predators were very heat-sensitive and required hot conditions? Then what were they doing jumping around in snow in all of their glory? Why do chestbursters take 5 minutes to be born? Why do we see a love scene involving Predator and the human?

The worst part of the movie is the end. We expected to see a true winner in a movie called ""AVP"" - ""Specie VS. Specie"".. well. Unfortunately, there is no winner. Why? Everyone DIES except the girl. So.. the human is the winner? Come on.. Sure, the fighting scenes were 2 minutes long each but at least they could of had some kind of an ending. What a frustration.

The commentary on the DVD is sick. The one with the girl who played Ripley-wannabe and the guy who played Weyland and some other guy. ""If you look carefully, the flying facehuggers look like flying vaginas"" - is the quote of what the girl said. And then during some scene the guy who played Weyland received a phone call on his cell! He answered it and even dared others to say hello to the caller. Total mess..

Anyway. This movie is not what I expected. Barely any fighting, barely any action, barely any sense.. and yet SO FULL of mistakes.

Rating: 2/5 for Good effects, suspensive (debatable) soundtrack.",1190505600,,2761,4.532128514056225

1563801,4,B00005JMZK,"Like many, I am a fan of both the ""Predator"" films & the ""Alien"" films, with the exception of ""Reserection"" which of course played like a slasher movie, this one brought back the suspense element so missing in that one, why so many trash it, I don't understand, yes, maybe it should have been longer, but it delivered the goods nonetheless, It definately can be considered a sequel to the ""Predator"" films & prequel to the ""Alien"" films, I think I have figured out why so many dislike it, my take from reading many reviews here, are the fact that many see continuity issues as their reasons for disliking it, there are maybe one or two, that I noticed, but that is it, most recent complaints are below that can be clarified such as>>>

Lance Henrickson playing Charles Weyland, Bishop's creator, this makes sense, seeing that this is the company Ripley from ""Alien"" worked for, & that Weyland Industries Inc. terraformed the planet Lv426 in ""Aliens"", & that Bishop is an android of Weyland, as for Henrickson's human appearance in ""Alien 3"" this could very well have been Weyland's great grandson, it is never said that Weyland didn't have offspring prior to his demise.

Many have complained that the Predators only come every 100 years, so therefore it contradicts the ""Predator"" films, not so, if you pay attention, the Predators come every 100 years for a rite of passage, this however doesn't mean they don't come to hunt for sport as seen in the other films, nowhere are we told the Predators are picky about their hunting climate, the Predators are hunters plain & simple, no matter what climate, hunting the aliens is a rite of passage, hunting humans for sport, there is a difference you know.

As for the aliens on earth, well Antarctica is a believable scenario, not exactly a booming town with people you know, & it sort of sets up the ""Alien"" films, especially when you consider the ""Company's obsession with capturing a specimen even at the expense of their own employees, how did they know what it was the Nostronmo crew had, this film helps explain that a bit better, remember Ash in ""Alien"" was an android created by Weyland's company who protected it.

Many have complained about the inpregnation time period being short, if you remember in ""Alien"" Kane's inpregnation period happened awful fast too, time is never clarified in that one or this one.

Many complain about the surviving Predator teaming up with the lone human survivor as being contradictory, not so, if you remember, the Predators at the end of ""Predator 2"" show a mutual respect for Danny Glover's character as a show of sportsmanship for defeating one of their own, why wouldn't they here for defeating an alien?.

Many say a Pyramid in ancient times could not exist in Antacrtica because it froze before humans, how do we know? we can't, & do we really know what lays beneath Antarctica, I think not.

& the reason the aliens never make it to society on earth is simply because the Predator nukes them all, & the survivor (Sanaa Lathan) could have easily told Weyland Inc. about her experiences & they would likely keep it quiet, but yet they knew in ""Alien"" what the Nostronmo crew had, that is why Ash protected it even though it was killing the crew.

As for the Queen surviving in the Pyramid, remember, she was frozen, as for there being more aliens than hosts, how do we know many of them were not frozen with her 100 years ago, we don't, there is nothing to suggest otherwise.

The only place I see inconsistency that no one seems to notice is the Predator's inpregnation, the Queen throws her tail into him, this does contradict ""Alien 3"" when an alien refuses to kill Ripley because of her inpregnation, the Queen would not have done this, & like one reviewer noted, the arriving Predators would have inspected their fallen one before allowing it into their ship, this is the only flaw aside from the Predators being so easily defeated by the aliens, other than this, this one stays overall consistent, I just requires you to think a bit.",1182211200,,4034,4.686440677966102
1563802,5,B00005JMZK,"Finally, after 14 years of anticipation, the ultimate monster slugfest arrived for moviegoers to witness the epic battle that is ""AVP: Alien Vs Predator"". Fans of the two franchises thought that this movie would have arrived to theaters much sooner than it actually did, since at the end of ""Predator 2"", audiences got a glimpse of an alien skull in the predator's trophy case, hinting that the two races had already met in combat. For some reason 20th Century Fox had trouble getting the movie off the ground, more than likely the scripts for the film were never good enough to do any kind of justice to either of the two franchises, so the execs at Fox decided to put the film on the backburner until a proper story could be crafted that would please fans of the series'. Eventually Fox found the right man to bring the two monsters together on screen, a director that has had plenty of experience with the science-fiction genre, none other than Paul Anderson (director of ""Resident Evil"" and ""Soldier""). With the cast assembled, a talented sci-fi director behind the camera, and a story that would hopefully do justice to these two hugely popular franchises, it was time for the battle to begin.

""AVP: Alien Vs Predator"" begins when a team of archaeologists are brought together by Charles Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the co-founder of the very corporation that Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley worked for in the `Alien' series, to explore an ancient temple hidden under the Antarctic. When the team arrives they discover that this is no ordinary temple, it is actually a proving grounds for young predators to hunt the most dangerous prey alive, the xenomorphs (aliens). Now, the archaeologists are in for the fight of their lives as they are stuck in the middle of a war that no matter who wins, we lose.

Director Paul Anderson has skillfully crafted an exciting monster smackdown that lives up to the quality of both character's respective franchises. It was interesting to see how this movie set into motion events that take place in the `Alien' franchise (which occurs many years after this movie), by setting up Charles Weyland's interest in the aliens. The movie also takes time to explore the rituals that the predators must go through to become the ultimate hunters, by showing how they achieve their vast array of weaponry and skills. There are other aspects of the story that links into each franchises established storylines, but I don't want to ruin everything for those that may have not seen this movie or any of the other films from the two franchises either.

The movie featured a solid cast of character actors led by veteran actor Lance Henriksen in the role of Charles Bishop Weyland, a nod to his character Bishop from James Cameron's impressive film ""Aliens"". Along with the talented cast, the film also boasted impressive visual effects and costumes that brought the aliens and predators to life, and made their brutal fight scenes incredibly entertaining to watch. Even though it took 14 years for this film to finally be made, the wait was definitely worth it, plus, any sooner may have been too soon, because the technology of the film industry was finally advanced enough to bring this epic war to life in a realistic fashion that will make the creators of the series' proud and entertain fans worldwide.

""AVP: Alien Vs Predator"" is available in both PG-13 and unrated editions, both contain violence and language.",1182124800,3,3449,4.8805460750853245
1563911,3,B00005JMZK,"I went in with low expectations for AvP, and incredibly, the film STILL disappointed me.  Anderson stages some decent action sequences and has a sharp eye for cinematography, but his writing is dreadful.  AvP is fun, but as an extention of the Alien and Predator mythos, it's a colossal dissappointment, and my 3-star rating is VERY generous.

By now we all know that the editing is choppy, the Alien life cycle is FUBAR, the acting is second-rate, the dialogue is laughable, and the final half hour is almost unwatchable in its badness, so I won't even go into those.

One thing that many fans fail to mention, however, is how AvP tries to connect itself with the Alien universe.  Instead of taking the smart route and establishing AvP as a separate ""just-for-fun"" franchise, Anderson desparately adds in references to past Alien films to connect his films with those of Scott, Cameron, Fincher, and Jeanuet.  Anderson fails miserably, and forever destroys the continuity with Charles Bishop and the earthbound setting.  AvP negates Ripley's ultimate goal in the Alien series: to prevent the Aliens from reaching now.  With AvP, we learn that Aliens have been on Earth for centuries!

I guess that's why I don't consider AvP to be canon.

The portrayal of the creatures is disappointing as well.  The Aliens still move like raptors (like in AR), and the Predators hulk around like drunken quarterbacks.  The one exception is the Grid Alien, which is in my opinion, the best character of the film.  Grid takes out two Predators (a nice big smack in the face to all the deluded Predator fanboys who were gloating about how one Predator could take out multiple Aliens) and even devises a plan to free the Queen.

The design of the film is very good.  The shapeshifting pyramid is an interesting setting and is well-shot by Anderson, and the Predator ship looks incredible, much better than the silly B-movie look of the ship in Predator 2, which was filled with fog machines.

The 2-disc edition has added CGI blood, some of which looks very fake, and also adds some minor but occassionally intriguing scenes which helps the movie flow much better than the theatrical version.  If for whatever reason you want this film, buy this version.

One last saving grace: AvP 2, due for release this Christmas, sounds so unbelievably bad that maybe this film will emerge as a fan favorite.  ""Well, AvP sucked...but it didn't suck as much as AvP 2.""",1181088000,,2437,4.814903846153846

1563918,4,B00005JMZK,"I get the sense from reading some of the reviews that many are disappointed with the film and I feel the same.  The 16Aug04 review gives a litany of the inconsistencies, quite a few of which I had noted myself.  Basic overall issues I have are: film was too dark, the fight scenes too blurred.  Having just viewed DVD 2 on interviews and making of the film, it seemed that they were more concerned with the movie holding up to the test of time and to die hard fans watching it over and over than for first time viewers in the movie theater.  They go over the fight scenes frame by frame, pixel by pixel of all the minutiae of effects but viewers have to watch the same thing in the split seconds that it's shown.  The suspense had not been adequately built up in my opinion.  One other plot flaw is that if things go awry, the last Predator ends it all with the famous Predator nuke.  However, would you trust saving the entire planet to a teenager.  What if he screws up that part... then we have six billion aliens swarming the planet.  I suppose the Predators may not care, but if they do want to save their backwater planet hunting grounds, does the mother Predator ship have a super nuke to git all those pesky aliens in time that are scrambling away.

This is still the best AVP movie as it's the only AVP film, but it is good and, of course, if you like the genre, you're going to have to see it.  Surprising, my fiancee who could never sit through a science fiction movie before, did so for the first time for AVP and enjoyed it.

1563920,2,B00005JMZK,"...crappy.  Why did they even bother putting people in this movie?  The script is appalling. And the dialogue is cheesy and shockingly boring.  What happens to the people (being hunted down one by one by the aliens and predator) is something that we have seen a hundred times before.  The lead actress (I'm determined to never learn this no talents name) is a Ripley wanna-be who despite trying to look cocky and in her element is absolutely dreadful and a complete failure.

The one redeeming part of this movie is the alien/predator fighting which, sadly, takes up only about 5 to 10 percent of the movie.  Which makes me wish that this movie had taken a chance and made it JUST the aliens versus the predators on an alien planet without any humans or something like that.  I wish that Hollywood would take chances rather than dishing out the same story but with different actors.  They seem to think that all you have to do is to use the title of some successful franchise to sell your movie but not worry about character, dialogue, credibility, etc, something that the first two alien movies and the first predator movie had.",1177891200,2,1129,4.63819095477387

That is just what the ""D-Box Motion Control System"" is.  You need extra hardware over-and-above a blue-ray player and HDTV to take advantage of it.  On top of that the extras do not include any thing like what was on the AVP DVD 2 disc set.  The blu-ray release is a 50GB dual layer disc and it looks to me like instead of using some of that extra space for at least the features found on the DVD 2 disc set they just wasted the space on D-Box.  Great, I guess, if you happen to have that hardware.  I do not.  The other very poorly done thing is the menus, I got the impression that the people that made them just slapped some lo-rez images up there with out a care that it looks awful.

1563974,3,B00005JMZK,"If you forget that this is the continuation of two very successful franchises, and consider this as a graphic novel adaptation, then it is actually a bit more successful than people give it credit for.

In tone and spirit, this is much more of a Predator movie than an Alien movie - it is as an Alien movie this most disappoints. However, as Predator movie I would suggest this is better than Predator 2 was.

The plot is set in modern time, when a heat signature revealing a hidden pyramid under the ice is seen by satellite. The owner of the satellite, played by Lance Henrikson, brings together a team of archaeologists, biologists and `security' (the equivalent of Star Trek redshirts I guess) to investigate. What they find is a pyramid used by Predators to hunt the ultimate prey - the Alien.

The rest of the story is just bunkum, and don't think too hard about many of the continuity points because much of it does not quite work, but the action scenes are handled adequately, mostly by pilfering ideas from the previous movies and reproducing them in watered down form for characters we have not yet come to care about. Best original (-ish) idea was that the pyramid reconfigures every 10 minutes once activated, to add spice to the hunt and help split our characters up to be picked off one at a time.

Saana Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver, but a stronger character than one might expect from Paul W. S. Anderson (who also directed Mortal Kombat). Nice to see Colin Salmon, the English actor of several Brosnan era Bond movies, in another role - shame it wasn't in a better movie.

Overall, this is not a disaster as a movie given its rushed production and low bdget - but don't go in with any expectations of anything approaching even the worst of the Alien movies. Think of it as a so-so Predator sequel and you get the idea.

1563975,4,B00005JMZK,"For the most part I've actually liked most of the stuff that Paul Anderson has done; nothing amazing but still some decent stuff. So I wasn't ready to condemn this movie before I saw it in the theater. I was hoping he would do a lot more with this franchise than what this movie turned out to be but I still found it enjoyable enough to buy the DVD and now the Blu-Ray (I certainly feel it is a better film than the second Predator and the 3rd & 4th Aliens.)

The Blu-Ray includes the unrated/director's cut and the added scenes help explain some more of the story and is definitely the best version to watch.

The acting is pretty blah (with the A & P out-acting most of the humans) though Ewen Bremner is funny. But the action is really what this movie is about and there is plenty of action here and what I thought was a very good ending.

As for the Blu-Ray transfer, it is very good; the picture is very clear and the dark scenes (most of the movie) look very good. The soundtrack is also nice and the trivia extra feature is cool.",1170979200,7,1036,4.1959798994974875
1563976,3,B00005JMZK,"It may not be high art, nor does it achieve or deserve ""best of year"" status. Did you notice I only gave it three stars?

Yes, it very well could have been better. But, for what it is, I must admit that I found much to enjoy with ""Alien vs. Predator.""

Unpopular as that sentiment may be to the eyes and ears of Paul Anderson bashers worldwide, I stand by my word when I say this film delivered all the ingenius entertainment I could ever want. This viewpoint, you should understand, comes from somebody who never once played the video game Anderson based his film around. I am therefore unable to pick apart every last second of the movie the way so many others here have gone out of their way in doing already. I am, however, quite familiar with the individual ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" films that also inspired this much debated endeavor. And, it is for that sole reason that I consider myself worthy enough to offer my own fair and openminded analysis.

First off, I think we can all pretty much agree that ""AVP"" is NOT a continuation of ""Alien"" or ""Predator."" Nor do I believe that Anderson intended it as such. The plot dynamics he has put in place clearly suggest that his script represents an entirely new mythology for both creatures. I think, for the most part, Anderson was attempting to kick-start a brand new franchise with this project. That belief falls into why I was able to appreciate his approach to the overall material. It was easier for me, with that knowledge, to avoid the temptation of comparing what I saw to the other films that came before. Aside from the plot holes everybody complains about, I give Anderson credit for adapting a fresh take on these time-worn monsters.

All this notwithstanding, I do feel obligated to take issue with FOX for two-timing me, one of their many loyal consumers, with this blatant ""unrated"" Director's Cut. Yes, the two-disc package is very appealing. You get nine minutes of extra footage, digitally enhanced ""gore,"" and an admittedly cool ""Alien vs. Predator"" comic book! My main question would ultimately have to entail why this wasn't the DVD FOX initially released. Money may indeed make the world go around, as we've all been told. But, why do so many distributors feel the need to double-dip on certain titles? That makes no sense to me now and probably never will for as long as I live.

But please don't let this minor quibble detract you from your decision to experience this film for yourself, especially if you've never seen it. Regardless of what you might have heard, this is not a totally unredeemable crud-fest. It is a suitably entertaining and altogether fun escape from reality. That is what I have always maintained movies of this nature should be about. I say give it a chance.",1170633600,2,2756,4.662551440329218
1563977,5,B00005JMZK,"alright so I'm only writing this review cause i am sick and tired of people claiming Paul Anderson is not a good director or screenwriter or anything like that. alright so get it straight here, who made the first video game to movie adaptation that was worth seeing? Paul Anderson- Mortal Kombat. who made a movie that you can watch a hundred times over and it's still great. Paul Anderson-Resident Evil, Event Horizon, Resident Evil Apocalypse, AVP. oh and pretty much every other movie he has ever made.

point here is, do not complain about Paul's talent as a director/screenwriter. he has just as good of a filmography as the best directors in the business.

NOW FOR MY ACTUAL REVIEW OF ""AVP""

well whats to say, a team of archeaologists, science technicians, bodyguards and drillers go to Balbatoa Island, sorry if i spelled that wrong. and once they get there they are looking for a place to set up a drill to go down to the level of the ancient pyramid they are looking for, they find that the hole is already made by the predators. they go down the hole, encounter hell, steal weapons from the preds, mostly get killed, fight an alien queen, and watch a ship full of predators fly away. the end. now that is the idea of the movie in a nut shell. now buy it, watch it,. enjoy it. and thank Paul Anderson for bringing the best movies to us for our enjoyment. thank you.",1170288000,5,1375,4.47011952191235
1563978,3,B00005JMZK,"I was a little let down with this movie. I was expecting a great [...]kicking, popcorn munching film, instead I felt like something was missing. The filmmakers had all the influences, storylines and ideas to fall back on from the other movies and the comics, yet they decided to go another route and try to write an original script for the infamous characters. I'm not saying this is a terrible film, it's just not what I expected. There were some cool and interesting fight scenes in places but that's all they are, two minute fight scenes. Another thing I didn't like is the teaming up of the human and the last predator. The tagline for the movie was something along the lines of whoever wins we lose. Now that tells me right there that the humans are nothing but target practice for the two main characters. Although it did end on a cool note, but hollywood will screw that up just like this and other movies(x-men anybody). I wish filmmakers weren't so afraid of the bigwigs and just stick to their guns and make a really cool film for the fans. Stop thinking about how much money you can make if you cut out scenes to get a pg-13 rating! Why don't the studios hire directors that are actual fans of the genre or characters? I'm just ranting here, so if you like kid friendly action movies like van helsing(another let down)or x-men than go ahead and buy this and let the studios think they're making worthwhile [...] while they're ruining a [...] franchise monster.",1169683200,,1471,4.554716981132075
1563979,2,B00005JMZK,"You want a quick assessment? Here it goes. AvP doesn't measure up to the original Predator movie or the first two Alien films. While it works as a mindless action/thriller it completely fails to make the grade on the story level and the continuity level. Essentially what you have is a good looking package with little depth behind it. So if that's your think knock yourself out. I prefer something more.

I don't know what it is with director Paul Anderson. He either has some good idea that ends up not following through completely or he has a not so good idea that turns out not so bad, but still doesn't really make the grade. AvP is no different. While the concept of Predators and Aliens battling out is very cool the way Anderson does it isn't. The idea was first conceived in a comic book by Dark Horse and then hinted at in a brief cameo shot on Predator 2. While this movie does borrow a mess of ideas from these the end result is still weak. The premise of Predators hunting Aliens as a rite of passage is a good idea, even if borrowed from the comic book and the whole Weyland tie in is interesting as well. So I'll admit props to those. The rest of it is tripe.

Essentially the movie is half-baked. The whole origin of the mysterious pyramid in the Antarctic was not only laughable but also technically impossible. The reasons for the pyramid being there is even more ridiculous. While the characters are diverse and interesting nothing is really done with them, thus making them rather useless. The potential for character development was great but it never happened. The cast was very good yet they were hardly used effectively. Don't even get me started on how painfully little they did with a talent like Lance Henrickson. The continuity with previous movies is rather dubious. For instance the whole incubation period for the aliens seems a LOT shorter with aliens popping out of chests in about an hour instead of days. Also the Predators (save for one) seem to be painfully lacking in any hunting skills as they get picked off as easily as the humans. It's as if this was a clan of accountants or something. Rite of passage or not, you got to be at least good enough to take on the prey.

So the story and character development are bad and there are plot holes that challenge Alien 3 on how major they are. The action and suspense aspects of the movie, however, are very impressive. You might find yourself at the edge of your seat at times with much of the action scenes. The special effects are also on the high quality level with nice animatronics, sets, and computer effects. The only special effects that I feel fall flat were the make-up and animatronics for the Predator's face. It just didn't look good compared to the previous movies, which seems strange since we're looking at over 15 years of technological advancements compared to the original films. Did I mention a stellar cast of relative unknowns that I hope I see more of in the future?

This movie could have been so much better if more thought was put into it, but since that's not the case it's left to being weak. So if you're a stickler for continuity in the Alien and Predator universes you probably will find plenty to not like in this movie. However if you just want some mindless mayhem with cool effects then Alien vs. Predator will probably deliver the goods for you. If you want a good story you're not going to get one here. At best you will get a serviceable script that moves you through the action, but no depth whatsoever. Aliens vs. Predator is a somewhat sad take on what could have potentially be a fantastic merge of franchises.",1169424000,2,3637,4.531202435312024
1563980,3,B00005JMZK,"I guess I expected too much from this DVD since I am a fan of both series and I was disapointed with the release of this movie on the previous DVD and on cinemas...

When it comes down to both races start taking on each other, we have only little time...I wanted more! More Predator hunting Alien, and vice versa...

About this DVD ? I was sure that the R-rated stuff would add something, and the deleted scene re-inserted would make a difference, but to be sincere, I didn't see that much difference...

So, off course, if you didn't buy the first edition of this dvd, it's worth buying this one, and I mean, if you really are a fan of the movies...

1564051,2,B00005JMZK,"As a legitimate fan of both the ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" franchises, and having read comics and played video games of the subject ""Aliens Vs. Predator,"" it was with some fine amount of anticipation that I awaited the silver screen's projection of a seemingly fool-proof predicament: Aliens fighting Predators.

My dissapointment, however, outweighed my anticipation, heavily.

In a lousy, unmotivated attempt to create a run-of-the-mill blockbuster, 20th Century FOX and director Paul Anderson shove the two species together inside of a pyramid and essentially leave it at that; not even attempting to replicate any of the better-proportioned storylines of the comics or video games, this brainless story, undeniably, is the least effort made to sell Predators and Aliens in the same movie to movie-goers. Whatever this film offers in less-than-amazing action sequences is lost to the absence of any hint of importance that the storyline offers, dropping even beneath the second Predator film on a scale of noteable stake.

While the film-makers deserve praise for fine graphics and nifty creature-design, the discredit begins at the harebrained storyline (a team of researchers investigate an Antarctic pyramid, only to run into birthing Aliens and just-arriving, hunt-ready Predators), slash-by-the-numbers plot progression (all humans are killed one-by-one by the extraterrestrials in their scuffle, until the remaining woman and Predator must run for their lives and battle the computer-generated Alien Queen), and sad attempt at trying to tie the film into the legacy of Aliens (Lance Henriksen re-appears as a pre-cyborg Bishop).

Turning the franchise into something more akin to Tomb Raider, FOX chooses to completely ignore the devotion of so many fans of the legacy in favor of an unremarkable action flick that really has no business carrying the names that have supplied stellar storylines and hard-hitting, mature action. I implore everybody to treat this film as a rental, and for newcomers to either series not to base their opinions on this sad work.",1166486400,3,2065,5.463949843260188

The only light during the filming of the action came from their tiny flashlights or the constant lighting of flairs. I hope the sequel will be filmed outdoors instead of caves and pyramids. I do love the predator costume/armor/latex makeup. I won't give away the ending, but you can tell it opens the door for a sequel.

1564056,4,B00005JMZK,"What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as  The Old Curiosity Shop . So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome.

1564057,2,B00005JMZK,"I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.

This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.

1564059,3,B00005JMZK,"I just watched AVP on DVD (saw it in the theatre also) and really, it's not nearly as bad as quite a few reviewers make it sound. I say this as a fan of the Alien franchise from the time I saw the first movie in the theatre at its original release.

Are there some errors and lack of continuity problems between the originals and this one? Sure. But there always are with sequels. I think a lot of people conveniently forget that there were story inconsistencies and problems within and between the first two Alien movies as well. Because the movies were outstanding I think people have been more willing to overlook them. Yet these same people gleefully tear apart similar issues in a movie that is more average. Sometimes you just have to go with the flow on these kinds of things for the sake of enjoying a movie.

The first two Alien movies are classics and I don't think anyone can ever approach them again within the franchise, and I don't think anyone should even try really. Trying would be an even greater formula for disaster. I feel that, despite what Anderson may lack in creative ability, he knows this. So he works within the limits of the genre today in crafting a decent movie that is representative of its type and has significant links to the prior movies.

Basically what I'm saying is, if you are willing to give up on fan nitpicking and just watch the movie for what it is, it's actually fairly entertaining. It is not a movie that rises above others of its kind, but it doesn't completely fail either. It has a good mix of action along with the story arc of Alexa and the main predator, which I enjoyed. I actually like that the movie isn't a total gore fest. It's gory enough to get the point across without flooding us with scenes of disembowelment.

What I enjoyed most about the movie were the little touches here and there that paid homage to the previous movies, especially the little thing with the pen when Weyland is sitting at his desk near the beginning, the outline of the satellite that looks like a queen, and the dangling chains in the abandoned village with their clinking sound. (I can't really speak to the Predator series since I've only seen the first one once and never the second one.)

AVP is part of my Alien collection (I also own the Quadrilogy, a must have) and I don't feel a true fan's Alien library is complete without it. I think if most people give it a chance, they'll enjoy it as a guilty pleasure and just won't fess up to it like I'm doing here. ;)",1157846400,4,2506,4.415584415584416

All I am going to say is this: go back and watch Alien and P1 again before passing any judgment.  I did recently.  Both has even less of a story than AVP.  Both would be receiving mediocre reviews if released today.  Those 2 star reviewers are comparing AVP to how they remember Alien and Predator.  Memories are doing a real number on them.

The only thing that AVP lacks is originality.  However, the story will continue.  AVP1 sets the stage for sequels. We should wait and see how it develops.  Meanwhile, enjoy the incredible CG and action sequences.

I didn't really like Alien, but if you were a big fan of that and Aliens you should have known that this movie wasn't going to have great acting or a good plot.  If you take AVP for what it is, its pretty fun to watch.

Now, yes I know.  It kinda takes any scare away that the Predators and the Aliens had.  I thought that when the girl and the Predator were outside they were gonna start kissing or something.  Also some of the parts of the fight scenes did make you unintentionally laugh.  But thats the director they have.

This movie could have been a more horror-like movie like Alien, but the director chose to make it a lot more action oriented.  Was that a bad idea?  No.  Would this have been a better movie with a different director?  Probably(Unless they got Uwe Boll!  Give me Anderson any day over him)  Is the acting subpar?  Yes.  Is it fun to watch Predators and Aliens fighting to the death?  Heck Yes!  Does the movie do what movie are supposed to do, which is entertain?  Yes.  So therefore this is not a bad movie.

There are other mistakes, but I will just get riled up even more if I get into them so I'm going to stop here. I know this is a negative review and a lot of  you might not like it, if that's the case, I don't care. I'm just expressing my opinions and my opinion is that this movie blows, big time! Hopefully the sequel to AVP, which will be taken into the hands of different directors and writers so I'm told, will be MUCH MUCH better suited to BOTH series! I suggest if you really want to collect this movie, just get the original AVP and not the Director's Cut. It's not worth paying the extra $10 just to have it. I have spoken!",1151020800,10,2247,4.25
1564119,1,B00005JMZK,"Paul W.S. Anderson PLEASE STOP. Watch the first 3 Aliens and the 2 Predator Movies. Study them at least 10 times. Do you see the character development and stoy line. Try to incorporate these elements in your movies. Stand your ground against money hungry producers like Ridley Scott and James Cameron did for their projects.

Even Alien 4 had some substance.

1564191,5,B00005JMZK,"I watched AVP with fairly low expectations after one or two reviews as savage as the two alien creatures featured in it. However, despite the fact that this isn't a perfect movie, I found it to be extremely enjoyable and didn't want it to end. Let's face it, this sort of film was always going to be more about action and somewhat less about storyline. And what action there is I found to be very entertaining, with lots of variety in the way the combat between the three races (if you include humans) takes place as well as many unpredictable moments and inventive use of each races particular traits.

Quite simply all my favourite aspects of the two film series are thrown together in one place, and I'm praying for an even better sequel.

To have a balanced viewpoint I should comment on the minor niggles that some people seem to dwell on (and miss out on the otherwise enjoyable parts of the movie). The plot itself - I won't comment on the specifics, but the story that emerges later on is perhaps a little too ambitous, and a simpler story that could have been built on in future sequel(s) may have been better received. My only other minor complaints were a couple of plot holes and minimal character development in most of the characters - but none of these will affect your enjoyment of this DVD as long as you don't dwell on them like most people seem to...

A few years ago most people doubted whether this crossover would ever happen. Now it's here most people are demanding perfection! I for one would rather appreciate what we have got and think about two of the greatest and most inventive sci-fi creatures ever created battling it out before your eyes.

The same person said that AVP is dumb, because they said that predators hunted aliens, so what where they doing in Predator 1 and Predator 2. Well, obviously that persons does not know nothing, cause in Predator 1, 2  and AVP it is clearly told(IN AVP IT IS EVEN DRAWN!!!!!) that predators are HUNTERS, and they choose the best HUNTERS withing they civilization to go and hunt some frrrrinking alien [...]. But whats my point?? That predators hunted aliens as a challenge to themselves every 100 years, but still hunted something else bethween that time, for example...... ETs or Alfs or maybe... HUMANS, yes.. HUMANS. The predator in Predator 1 and 2 was only there hunting to prepare himself for the next Alien-ass-wooping.

First of all, the acting is flawless. Much like LOTR the cast featured a fair share of lesser known actors. like LOTR I STRONGLY feel that these actors in AVP will be a force in the acting world for many years to come.

  What i really feel propels this film to a whole nother level than say Star Wars, is the balance of exciting non-stop action that goes along with a truly epic plot. Well I am not going to ruin the ending for you guys but lets just say you will NOT be dissapointed. Now I am not biased or anything but I did happen to see the movie three times on opening day. The power of this film is incomparable to anything put out in years.

1564196,3,B00005JMZK,"`AVP, Alien vs. Predator' directed and co-authored by Paul W. S. Anderson is almost inevidably seen as pure exploitation of characters from earlier popular movies, especially since the whole premise was suggested by s quick shot near the end of `Predator 2' when we see an obvious `Alien' skeleton in the trophy case of the predator. This means the expectation invariably is that it will fall many cuts below it's exemplars, especially since the original films were directed by the likes of Ridley Scott and James Cameron. So, my mission is to examine just how this film inevitably fails to live up to its stellar parents.

The first thing which strikes me is that the story falls into the same trap of every poorly written action thriller, in that no sooner do the major characters get to their dangerous venue than they start to do stupid things. The stupidity is so blatent here that the lead character, Sanaa Lathan, playing the ice climbing expert / guide has to point this out. The other side of this coin is that since we know perfectly well that this Antarctic venue will house at least one, or both of the most horrific alien monsters ever invented, which immediately spoils almost all of the mystery behind the story. When James Cameron did `Aliens', we also knew there was evil afoot on the `Alien' planet, but Cameron's point of view and strong characters made up for this lack of surprise. I found several other oddities in the story, such as the inconsistency between the object of the pyramid and the fact that the visiting predator warriors killed off the humans they found at the scene.

Another problem is that this cast simply did not hold a candle to the strong casts of `Alien', `Aliens', `Predator', and `Predator 2'. No matter how good Sanaa Lathan was in the lead role, she simply could not hold a candle to the iconic performances and role of Ripley created by Sigourny Weaver (at the cost of being forever typecast into this persona). In spite of some earnest attempts, I simply could not connect with these characters as easily as I could sympathise with Schwarzenneger and Co in `Predator' or Cameron's excellent cast in `Aliens'. The only character with whom I developed any sympathy was `Aliens' and `Terminator' veteran, Lance Hendriksen's character.

And, in spite of the `de rigeur' good special effects, the real attention getters were the great inventions of the original monster creations by H. R. Geiger (Alien) and Stan Winston (Predator), based on an idea by James Cameron.

In general, I found the technical aspects of the filming and editing to detract rather than add to the experience. In one of the voiceover commentaries, the director said they made a point of making it dark, over anticipated studio objections. Well, I think the studio got it right. The fast action is even harder to appreciate in the dark than it would be in a well lit scene. Ridley Scott is famous for `dark' scenes (see especially `Blade Runner'), but he also seems to have the technique to carry it off.

In balance, the movie still managed to entertain with a reasonably interesting, albeit totally fantastic premise and a closure to the rampaging aliens which fell well within believability, given the facts available from earlier movies. It was certainly better than some other stinker FX action works such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'.",1145577600,4,3390,4.848013816925734
1564197,1,B00005JMZK,"If you're a nerd, or have ever been friends with one, you probably remember discussions concerning superhero or monster smackdowns. Superman vs. Mighty Mouse? Thor vs. The Hulk? King Kong vs. Jaws in ankle-deep water? Who would win? Well, one of those nerds - or several of them, from the look of the credits - wrote and directed a movie about just that.

In some ways, this is nothing new. Almost every monster ever created has been pitted against one of his famous counterparts: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys, Godzilla vs. the Netherlands, and (believe it or not) Emmanuelle vs. Dracula. This sort of fantasy cockfigting is never a strong sign for either character, and ""AVP"" is no exception.

The main difference is that, while these other films are theatrical or TV cheapies, ""AVP"" is an A-budget movie. The production design, photography and effects work are well worthy of its predecessors. The problem, as you might imagine, lies in the story.

""AVP"" is primarily a clone of the first ""Alien"", which means for the first forty minutes, we're introduced to characters WE KNOW are going to get eaten or torn to bits. While the original film has a group of great actors to help buttress the script and make for a compelling opening, the cast and dialogue of ""AVP"" are rather generic, making the assembly of this team fairly perfunctory. ""Alien"" knew this gathering of characters was unneccessary (as it was called ""Alien"" and not ""Space Miners"") and introduced them together on the ship to save time.

Things progress like a page torn from ""Mad Libs"": A team of ragtag Proper Nouns, including a Empowering Adjective woman, is drawn to a mysterious derelict Noun by an unexplained Other Noun. The set-up is closer to a blend of ""The Thing"" and ""Armageddon"", and soon we're wandering around more dark corridors with glow sticks and laser sights, knowing FULL WELL this time what they're going to encounter. Even though this film's primary audience is fans of the previous movies, it's paced as if none of this has ever happened before. The environments of ""The Thing"" and ""Alien"" were appropriately brutal to set a mood. The Antarctica of ""AVP"", though, seems more like a snowglobe, with flakes gently drifting about.

The derelict Noun this time is a deeply buried Aztec/Mayan/Vietnamese temple. As the team works its way inside, it discovers a sacrificial chamber, hiding the alien eggs and the Predator's laser weapons. It's not long before the trap is sprung, and most of the team is either incubating beasties, or separated from their companions, or both. The temple (courtesy of ""The Cube"") begins to shift and reconfigure itself every ten minutes, creating a maze that seems nearly impossible to solve.

Taking a page from ""Chariots of the Gods"", we discover that the Predator race came to earth (long before any of the other movies) to use this temple to breed Aliens on earth (long before any of the other movies). Young Predators would then come to hunt the Aliens in the temple every hundred years as a rite of passage ceremony. Considering how difficult the Aliens have been to kill in the past, this shifting maze comes across as a wrinkle for the video game tie-in. As formidable as the Predators are, it seems unlikely (between their maturity rate and the rite itself) that they would have survived long enough to create their own franchise.

This premise seems to be contrived primarily for the pupose of enabling the team to discover the plot through translation of hieroglyphs, rather than visual discovery. Not only is it unconvincing, it also guts the impact of an ""Alien"" sequel where the creatures threaten to infest Earth for the first time (I know ""Alien Resurrection"" brushed on this, but it wasn't the exectution of it that I was hoping for).

The titular battles between the Aliens and the Predators are enjoyable. Considering that this is presumably the main attraction, it's surprising how brief and choppy they are. There isn't a lot of logic to them - the acidic Alien blood seems to burn through some things immediately, and others not at all - but there's a little fun to be had.

Not to do anything the easy way, the Predators have also captured an Alien queen in the temple, periodically defrosting her when more eggs are needed. Of course, her drones release her at the end of act two (which I'm assuming also happens every hundered years). Act three then consists of the Empowering Adjective woman running around Antarctica in her tank top battling the Alien queen.

The most interesting element of the film is that it tries to do ""Terminator 2"" one better and make the lone surviving Predator a sympathetic team member. It mainly serves to make you wonder what the film might have been like if this had happened earlier, or if the Predators had simply taken the place of the human characters as the center of our sympathies.

So why did I watch this? Didn't I have a good idea of what I was in for? Sure. ""AVP"" is a Twinkie of a movie. You know they're not good for you, and that you might feel a little sick afterwards. But sometimes you just want a Twinkie.",1144886400,6,5149,4.774157303370787

ONe major point everyone agrees that the story is distorted and twisted, even the entire history of human race has to be rewritten to fit this story. The backdrop of this story looks as if a 10 year old has written this screenplay out of his childish imagination. Even the storyline in the movie is pretty weak . All human characters die except one and humans are not at all involved in any fight sequences( They are just mute spectators). I had the feeling that its story could have been better.

  Although acknowledging all this,This is a great action movie. The action stills,the breathtaking images,the larger than life fight sequences all add to the eeriness of the movie.

1564281,3,B00005JMZK,"When Aliens vs Predator originally came to DVD I decided to hold off on getting it. Interviews of the movie's director indicated that this was not exactly what he had in mind when he made it, mainly because the studio executives told him to chop it down to a PG-13 90-minute movie instead of the R rated two hour one he made. Despite the decision resulting in AvP making a good showing at the box office, the movie itself could have been better. Knowing this, I was waiting for the Director's Cut to come out on DVD.

Well, it looks like I jumped too soon. This is NOT the actual Director's Cut, but instead a Special Edition with about thirty seconds of new material added in to make it just a wee bit more bloody, (or as best as I can tell that is). There is nothing new to the story. There are no new scenes. Nor are there any of the explanations or missing sub-plot the Director mentioned. Overall, I'm more than a little disapointed in this DVD because it's not what it should have been. For obvious reasons, the thing doesn't even have a comentary from the Director either.

On its own merits, Aliens vs Predator is a 3-star flick... average at best. It's not bad, but it's not all that great. But should they come out with a REAL Director's Cut with all the stuff they chopped out to make it more appealing the the masses, odds are I'll buy that one too, but I'll be more cautious next should they try to re-bag the same movie again.",1142726400,7,1440,4.3099630996309966

1564285,1,B00005JMZK,"The pros:

1. Riding on the crest of the wave of a legacy of movies, books, and comics.

The cons:

1. Poor acting.

2. Lack of character development.

3. Lack of intensity.

4. Lack of a solid plot.

5. The further presence and near ubiquity of plot holes.

6. Anticlimactic action sequences

My point: There are better ways to waste your time.

Before I could ever drive, I used to read AVP books (bit nerdish, I know). I relished the fear incited by movies like Alien and Predator, and the thought of bringing them together seemed like something I had always wanted to see when I was younger.

With great expectation, I watched this movie (that is, alone - my wife wouldn't watch it with me). This movie is proof that most expectations are meant to be broken. There's not much more than a name to carry this story, and the only thing that made me happy was the very end - because it was finally over.

You would think that with the technological advances that movie makers - 20th century fox, no less - have would help to incorporate realism, drama, and excitement in a much anticipated movie such as this. But then, if you're a thinking man, you probably didn't waste your time by sitting throughout the entire movie. The main character spends her first 15 minutes of camera time complaining of how difficult things are going to be for her and the crew in traversing this dangerous Antarctic terrain. What ruins the continuity of her thoughts is the fact that everyone is driving to their intended site in giant tractors - how's that for danger? In addition, they waste all of this time cruising through the ice to get to one end of this island when (apparently) the other was already bordering water. By this time, I was wondering why it took us 25 minutes to get absolutely nowhere in this movie.

There are a lot of great movies out there today. This is not one of them. Don't be as dull-minded as I was - don't waste your time watching it.",1140048000,6,1947,4.450704225352113

1564287,3,B00005JMZK,"I really did like this movie a lot when I watched it the first time. Since then, I went back and watched; Predator, Predator 2, and Alien, Aliens, Alien 3. They were all fantastic. Then I watched Alien vs. Predator and I found it lacking.

Compared to the others, the movie seemed childish. It has to be a little childish if it's rated PG-13. You know something isn't right if every Predator/Alien movie before this is rated R and this was knocked down to be a PG-13 film.

The acting was pretty lame in this movie with the only noticeable star being Lance Henriksen, which is a fantastic choice because he is a wonderful actor, it's especially great considering he was in both Aliens and Alien 3 and it's nice to see an old face we all know. But even he could not help the film. Everyone else is a bunch of nobodies, and after seeing this movie, looks to stay that way.

The story had its share of problems as well. The number one problem being that the movie is set in 2004. What a horrible choice to set a movie in. At least it still felt right to have Predator 2 in 1997. But 2004 just felt too early a time to have this taking place. Is Bishop Wayland, played by actor Lance Henriksen, the ancestor of the human Bishop that designed the androids on Alien 3? It has to be since Alien 3 is set at least 54 years from now. Certainly not 2004. I was never really clear on that.

I did, however, like the storyline of how in the past humans would breed aliens as a human sacrifice so the Predators could begin their hunt. I also liked how they showed it in the past as the Predators were being overthrown and would self destruct. Very well done scene, the chest buster skeletons looked great and gave a good intro for that story.

The bond the Predator shared with the human at the end of the film was very interesting and obviously a tribute to the comic book series which occasionally showed the two species working together.

Now to the look of the film. The map to the pyramid that was on the Predator's arm reminded me a lot of the Hive map used in the lack luster movie Resident Evil that Mr. Paul directed as well. This which isn't a good thing and has me wondering if we will see maps like this in future movies he is involved with. I have to give it to them; the Aliens in the movie looked fantastic, very sleek and well designed. I give them props for that. Predator looked great as well, but bulkier. They looked so bulky, it look as if they didn't have a neck, nothing like the look of the Predators in the first and second film. But when the Predator took of his mask, the detail was astounding. He looked fantastic. The face just seems to look better and better with each new film.

The only thing I didn't like about it being set in Antarctica was the Predator must have been freezing. I know once it wasn't covered in ice, but it's been established in the first two films that Predators prefer hot/humid environments. They must have been shaking in their boots and very uncomfortable.

The battle sequences were great, every single one of them. If nothing else is good in this movie, the action is. It was nice to see the return of the Predator's weapons as well.

Overall, as a movie by itself, it's decent. When compared to the other movies, they are all far superior to Alien vs. Predator. This movie reeks of what could have been with the scent of a good movie. So I can see why people like this movie with the great action scenes and fantastic monsters. But I can also see why long time fans like my self don't care for it. The acting is horrible and the story of them going to Antarctica to look for an ancient temple is kind of dumb. Like I said, I liked the ancient scenes. So I'm torn; when they make another movie, we need a better story, and a better director. Resident Evil: Apocalypse was better than this.",1139875200,3,3835,4.293222683264177
1564288,3,B00005JMZK,"""AVP"" is exactly the type of film we associate with director Paul Anderson's work. It's slick, fast-paced, glossy (but not so glossy that its style becomes distracting) - and tosses logic, continuity, and plot out the window. In other words, it's a fun PG-13 afternoon for preteens. ""AVP"" is better than any of Anderson's other films, largely due to Anderson's strong affection for both the original ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises and I found myself enjoying it despite myself. Although it has virtually nothing to do with the successful Dark Horse ""Alien vs. Predator"" comic books, it shares a similar anything-goes spirit.

Virtually the entire film revolves around the discovery of a subterranean pyramid in Antarctica. The pyramid was constructed for the Predators, a nasty humanoid alien race of ruthless hunters. The Predators use the pyramid as a testing center of sorts; they send their adolescent warriors there to prove their mettle in combat as a coming-of-age ritual. Locked deep within the pyramid is an oversized Alien Queen whose purpose is to create enough slimy, evil Alien spawn to provide the Predators with a worthy challenge. A small band of explorers must do their best to survive this violent confrontation between two exceptionally nasty extraterrestrial races.

On the positive side are the special effects, which deftly stretch ""AVP""s budget and make it appear to be a much more expensive film than it really is. This is also an exceptionally nonpretentious movie, unlike most current sci-fi films (""War of the Worlds,"" ""Revenge of the Sith"" etc) which strive for an overbearing epic feel. There are also some cleverly choreographed fights between Aliens and Predators, as the title of the film requires. And, thankfully, campy self-satire is at a minimum (unlike ""Jason vs. Freddy"").

There are multiple negatives to this film, and the more sophisticated you are, the more you will roll your eyes. (Amazingly, no one appears cold or visibly exhales their breath near the South Pole! The Aztecs used a decimal system! Aliens apparently don't need to incubate in host bodies!) At no point does anything in this film even approach the sheer terror of the original ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" and it's obvious that Anderson is no Ridley Scott or James Cameron in the directing department. However, I have to stress that I did enjoy myself despite the many lapses in common sense and logic. ""AVP"" is a fun (if easily forgettable) ride if you aren't fanatical about the original ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" series.",1139702400,2,2527,5.113801452784504
1564349,2,B00005JMZK,"Alien vs Predator is not a bad movie, the reason people hate it so much is because we all know that there was the potential for something great to happen with it, but just the mere fact that Paul Anderson managed to get the movie made at all is commendable.  It was in development hell for over ten years. Granted it isn't the best of the series, a definite money-making movie on Fox's part, but i wouldn't say it was the worst. There are some genuinely good scenes and a sequel is on the way with a bigger budget that could do more for the franchise than this

Now, here is where I get really angry. Obviously 20th Century Fox thinks the general public are very stupid because they try to sell us this below-average crap pile that has no difference from the previous edition apart from some box art and more scenes of people talking. They could at least have put in some retrospective interviews. But no, this is just another attempt to make money by the studio.

Unrated means they didn't bother to submit it for classification and therefore can pass it off as a ""director's cut."" Although in fact the supposed added gore and carnage that the director said Fox made him cut out in many interviews at the time of the film's release has still not surfaced and looks like it never will. The reinstated footage does make it a more complete movie but there are no action sequences added in. You get four talking parts and some short moments of the predators walking around and a thirty second bit of cutting open a dead alien's head. Nothing special. You're better off buying the release of the movie that came out a year ago.

I wish that the studio would quit clowning around and just release a definitive version of this, instead of teasing that there will be new stuff then just ripping us off again. Save your money.

The acting is what it could be which is not very good and the alien on predator battles and or fights are really dissapointing.  This is no war.  It's one predator and a human girl fighting a bunch of aliens.  False advertising is what I call that.

A glaring flaw from the historical perspective: a pyramid built by an culture ancestor to ones we know of would not be a patchwork of their styles. If such a culture existed, we could recognize it by characteristics that developed (or deteriorated) in the others.

The humans are cookie-cutter action flick characters. The only real effort to help the viewer identify with them is when one shows pictures of his kids. My, what stunning originality.

Plus it has one deleted scene (out of 3) on disc 2 which is not available anywhere else and shows Miller still trying to find the way out (after Wayland's death). Lots of bonuses on second disc (exacty the same as the region 2 Extreme edition - where the film is extended with just 90 seconds of alternate opening).

The photos have also detected a heat source at the pyramid.  Little does this large group of explorers know that they are headed for a conflict between a hunter and his alien prey - a conflict for which the humans are used in horrible ways.

1564358,4,B00005JMZK,"First off, I want to start off by saying I think this was a fine entry in the Alien/Predator film franchise.  In keeping in tone with Cameron's Aliens, AVP is mostly action, without much scare.  But it does make little nods to the other films, mostly the two Predator films (many of the weapons from P2 are back) and the first two Alien films.  That aside, the unrated film adds much to the film to improve it, without destroying the pacing of the film.  You get more character development, so you get to care more about the characters before they are slaughtered.  But beware, if you see the words UNRATED and think this is going to be a scary gorefest, it isn't.  It's still basically the same PG-13 film.  Very little of the blood spilt in this film is human.  There's only one character killed on screen that wasn't killed in the original cut (I won't say who, in case you haven't seen the film yet), and it isn't very bloody at all.  And if you want to see what exactly was added, you can either turn on the unrated marker that (like Stripes) lights up a little alien logo whenever new footage starts, or you can watch the new scenes seperate from the film altogether.  And, if you want to see the original unaltered film, you get that as well.

Plus, the dvd does have plenty of cool extras, all about the making of the effects, and how PWS Anderson got involved in the first place.  That's probably the highlight of the set.  But, if you see the words UNRATED and are expecting something they couldn't show in theatres, you will be disappointed.  But still, all in all, a fun film, and it branches the two franchises seamlessly.",1136160000,9,1635,4.424749163879599
1564418,5,B00005JMZK,"first of all, for Aliens versus Predator, you have to go in with an open mind, don't go in thinking of Arnold or Danny Glover and their role in this movie, cause it won't work.

with that, here is my take on the movie and how it goes.

movie starts off solid, satelitte belonging to Weyman corporations gets a heat plume in anartica, so he gathers a team involving the best diggers in the world, an archelogical team, and an ice tour guide to lead the team. they end up isolated in an island a 1,000 miles from land where they discover a tunnel was made 24 hours prior to their arrival by somebody, and this leads to an underground pyramid, where the heat source is coming from.

they enter the pyramid, and set off a chain of reactions, releasing the Aliens, then mess up big by taking the predator's weapons, and this is where the actions really kicks in.

only 3 predators are sent against a handful of aliens and people. as for the storyline, here is how it goes.

the predators taught humans to build pyramids and used them for sacrifice to help create the aliens, which they would then turn around and hunt down.

if they beat the aliens, then they proved themselves worthy, but if they lost, then they blew up everything. in doing this, they captured the alien queen to make eggs then lured the humans for sacrifice, but when a couple of the predators get killed by the aliens, everything is left to one predator and one human.

the movie is awesome, the build up to the fight scenes is awesome, and best of all, the aliens-predator fight scenes are awesome. they fight in these awesome battles to the death, and some of the battle scenes and who dies and how is surprising.

overall, the movie is awesome, and the ending is clever too, which leads to a possible AVP 2.",1135900800,2,1776,4.409785932721713
1564419,1,B00005JMZK,"And this is a perfect case-in-point. Not only did it attempt NO continuity with the respective Predator and Alien series, but seems to go out of it's way not only trying to rewrite the entire history of both frachises, but coming up with a ludicrous alternate history for human civilization itself. And a weak history it is at that. It must have taken them all of 10 minutes to dream it up!

- Apparently... The Aztecs, Cambodians, and Egyptians were the worlds first civiliations (after the great Predator Apocalypse that is). Hm... News to me! News to any World History professor for that matter! They could have put in the extra effort to make this aspect of the movie a little less ridiculous. I mean... not only is it an insult to history, but to science as well. I mean... continental drift must have gone into some serious overdrive. It's the only way to explain the fact that Antarctica went from temperate and cozy to icey wasteland in but a few thousand years.

- The Predators have no intrest in people as sport at all in this movie. Curious then, being that humans were the big game hunt the predators in the two previous predator movies were after. Not only that, but this movie pays no regard to the fact that predators hate the cold. In the previous movies predators always went where it was hot, and where there was strife. Niether of which are to be found in Antarctica.

- The Aliens must be Gods chosen death fiends given that there is an awful lot of Alien immaculate conception going on. There's more Aliens running around than there is human hosts in which they could have grown. Unless of course the movie makers want us to assume that multiple Aliens gestated in a single host. Awful impertinent on their part to make such a grievous change to the Aliens established biological pattern. And quite unwelcomed I might add.

Science fiction geek gripes aside... it would have been a bad movie without all the un-wanted changes to the aformentioned franchises.

There is no real atempt to establish any sort of meanigful connection with the characters. The closest we get is one character showing off pictures of his children. Perhaps the director thought character development was unnecessary since most of the characters are killed before the movie is even half over. And the one who does make it to the very end is seriously lacking in acting prowess. I was to focused more on how annoying her voice was than on what she was actually saying, which, as I found in subsequent viewings, wasn't very important anyway (To be fair... most of the actors were lacking in that pesky acting skill. At least they were killed swiftly). One thing lacking from this movie that is especially bothersome is the woeful absence of suspense! The Alien and Predator franchises were always overflowing in this catagory. It's what helped make the movies great! And it's troublesome omission is quite irritating. This problem could probably have been rectified had the movie not been so short and rushed. People will sit through a long movie so long as it's a GOOD long movie.

There are a few things which could have saved this movie. Firslty, if the movie story-line were more like the AvP computer games, it might lend the production a breath of credibility. For instance, if it were set in space, in the future, with a team of colonial marines, on a strange, tropical, jungle planet with a big mysterious temple and they detected 'alien technology' or a 'distress beacon' or something similar to those, then bitter fan boys such as myself might not have been so dissapointed. Secondly... for the love of God... better actors. Talent is an important ingrediant when making a movie. Sad that so many studios overlook that fact. And thirdly is suspense! Don't cut substance because you're afraid of people's attention spans. Try to keep their attention rather than throwing up your ams in defeat when faced with a persons nack for losing interest.

All in all, this movie could have been truly great, but it went totally and completely unrealized. A prime example of hollywoods lust for quick profits rather than love for the fans. An insult.",1135382400,7,4143,4.745833333333334
1564420,2,B00005JMZK,"I read an interview with director Paul W.S. Anderson several months ago where he discussed being forced at the eleventh hour to cut down the film to a teen friendly PG-13 rating. In the interview he mentioned that all the explicit kill shots were actually filmed and that there were several other sequences that he was forced to cut, including one where you see the Alien Queen being pumped full of steroids which helps the characters (and moviegoers) speculate that this was to speed up the Alien's life cycle. This would have explained a lot. The DVD box is marked UNRATED VERSION. There is no mention of the director being involved at all in this re-edit, which is essentially the EXACT SAME FILM, with a few extended dialogue sequences and some very insulting bad CGI blood added to the existing footage. How dumb does FOX think we are?",1135123200,8,840,4.6824324324324325
1564421,5,B00005JMZK,"First and foremost, just rent the movie. Everyone has an opinion, and mine although totally correct in my own mind, is just as opinionated as the next.

Some people have gone crazy going over and over the ""flaws"" of this movie, and bashing the Director. So to those people I say this...

1) Get a camera and start filming if you think you can do it better.

2) Lighten up on the flaws. Every movie has flaws. Some dudes are getting all technical about ""well how did Antarctica become warm then go cold"", and ""how come the pyramid only moved twice when its suppose to move every 10 minutes"" and ""the Aztec calendar was different than what was suggested"" and ""the breeding cycle is longer"" on and on and blah blah blah. Good lord people, predators and aliens aren't exactly a REALISTIC, REAL WORLD idea either are they!???

Now I WILL agree that it was totally uncool for 20th Century Fox to put the rating decrease on the movie. None of the other movies in either genre was less than R, and the movies would not have been as good if they WERE anything less. The first Predator was pretty raw; commandos out in the jungle are going have potty mouths. And the skinned prey was pretty radical too. Same with the Alien flicks. It seems that almost every movie that comes to DVD has an unrated version. I mean we are usually only talking about 10 to 15 minutes of footage that's cut. I don't see the point in cutting it out except so they can make bigger $$$.

This movie has great action, a very cool and creative story, and awesome special effects. Sure it might stray a little from the original stories of both species, and the other stuff might be off a tad. But I re-emphasize point #2 above. This is a sci-fi action. Stuff is going to be far-fetched. Last time I checked, that's kinda what sci-fi movies were supposed to be...far-fetched.

I would highly recommend this movie to any fan of the genre, particularly the Predator fans because it seems that the Alien gu-rus didn't dig it as much. But when I say gu-rus I mean fanatics, the guys who like know the exact breeding cycle time for a chest burster.

ONE LAST THING - The Directors Cut DOES add some info to support some of the gripes of other reviewers. If your going to buy AVP, get the Directors Cut. It has both versions (unrated and theatrical) on one disc. Which is cool.",1134950400,5,2334,4.413953488372093

The start is basic of an action movie and you might be a little intrigued but as the aliens start showing up and then the predators any suspence or interest is gone. This isn't an action its a comedy, half the time the alien and predator don't look like their going to fight; they look like their gonna kiss!

The story is in the UNRATED EDITION.  The action is in the UNRATED EDITION.  The version which makes sense is the UNRATED EDITION.  The PG-13 edition is the chopped up, convoluted crapfest we saw at the theaters.

1564517,3,B00005JMZK,"We recently had re-editions of the two Predator movies and the unbelievable Alien Quadrilogy collection. These new versions or editions tried to prepare the audiences for what promised to be a match to remember, Alien vs. Predator.

Unfortunately, the movie did not fulfill the expectations of the fans of the two alien creatures, but on the bright side it was more interesting and less campy than the previous crossover of Freddy vs. Jason. The film has some interesting points in the story but it takes too many liberties with the origin and purposes of the two main characters. The movie begins with Weyland enterprises (the same company who sends Ripley and her team to space on the first three alien films) assembling a team of specialists for a special mission to Antarctica, an interesting fact is that Mr. Charles Bishop Weyland is the same actor (Lance Henriksen) who played the characters of Bishop and Bishop II in the Alien series, which helps make the relation that he was the template for the droids.

From then on, the story loses direction every passing moment, a pyramid was found in Antarctica and they must research why is it there and who built it. The answer? Predators built it so they could have fun hunting Aliens every 100 years. The team gets trapped in the middle of a pyramid filled with Aliens and Predators fighting each other.

There are however some memorable sequences, the first encounter between the two creatures is just incredible, and even though the Predator ends up being the sidekick of specialist Alexa Woods (Saana Lathan), seeing the two alien species fighting each other is worth the movie. Even though the ending is basically the same stuff we already saw in Predator 2, the writer tried to give it a twist to let the door open for a sequel. I did enjoy this film because of the fighting and the visuals, but I have mixed feelings at the moment of deciding if the movie was good or not, I dare to say it is more of a visual feast than good storytelling and well, I kinda liked it.",1133740800,,2026,4.653631284916201
1564518,3,B00005JMZK,"A long time ago, a little comic known as Aliens vs. Predator appeared.  It took the comic fans by storm.

For one, the idea of a franchise crossover was new.  Most people didn't realize the same company owned rights to both (due to a series of mergers).  And rarely had movie franchise transferred over to comics.  Because the stakes are lower in the comic world, a comic like Aliens vs. Predator was possible.

What was far more entertaining is that the comic actually made sense.  It kept the respect for the Predators and their ancient hunting techniques, while at the same time portraying the Aliens as the ultimate prey.  Given the nature of the two diametrically different franchises, this is no small feat.  Predator was a testosterone pumping challenge to men everywhere that we've somehow lost what makes us men; Predators remind us that the real manly thing to do is pick up a spear and kill stuff.  Aliens, on the other hand, are all about the violation of the human male.  It reduces men to whimpering crybabies as the aliens force themselves down our throats, impregnate us, and then kill us.  Now combine these two critters together.  Who do you think you'll sympathize with more?

Yep, the Predators.  Which is exactly why Aliens come out on the bottom of the rung all the time.  Aliens are, well, alien.  It's hard to root for them, care for them, or otherwise feel anything but disgust.  The presence of an alien queen helps things a bit--it personifies the endless drones--but it hardly makes them a viable choice to root for.

The original Aliens vs. Predator series took place on another world.  Humans got caught in the middle, and a tough woman ended up proving herself as a warrior at the side of Broken-Tusk.  That Predator was stranded, like her, on a planet swarming with Aliens.  So the two unlikely allies had to band together and fight back.

The comic concept combined the masculinity of Predator with the maternal war of Aliens, and it worked. Fortunately, Paul W. S. Anderson had enough sense to follow the same formula, with one concession: he placed the events on Earth in the near future.  By doing so, we realize that the threat of Aliens is more than just killing the characters (who, let's face it, we don't really care about anyway).  It's that they might get out and spread, thereby overrunning the entire planet.

It also explains why nobody knows about Aliens yet.  Of course they don't, because the Aliens movies took place in the far future.  Predators, on the other hand, have appeared twice (Predator and Predator 2, respectively).  So we've got the ""Thing"" scenario: isolated and yet the fate of the world is in our heroes' hands.

So back to the movie.  This is a Predator movie.  The Aliens are just bad guys.  The Predators, though technically bad guy, are more anthropomorphic than Aliens (heck, they at least wear clothes), and are thus de facto team to root for.  You could argue that you should root for the humans, led by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), but there's not particularly likeable or comprehensible anyway.  The heroine is Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan).  She struggles to hold her own in a massive cast dominated by two guys in suits.

All this adds up to essentially a Predator slice-and-dice fest mixed with the scenery shifting antics of Thir13en Ghosts.  What, you didn't know that the pyramid where the Predators are shifts around every 100 years?

Aliens and Predators are now kiddie fodder, boogiemen that are no longer scary in the way that Frankenstein's Monster, Dracula, and the Wolfman are no longer scary.  In the golden horror days of the 80s, these guys were king.  Now, they're pretty much there to bolster ticket sales, in the same way that the above trio of bad guys faced off in horror movies as their popularity waned.

Ironically, Freddy Vs. Jason set the template for crossover films in the 21st century and AVP actually fails to live up to the (admittedly low) standard.  FVJ knew how ridiculous the concept was but at the same time stayed true to its roots.  AVP is pretty hollow in comparison, and that's saying something.

Standing on its own, without knowing too much about AVP, the film's actually not a bad way to spend two hours. But who goes to see a film about two legendary bad guys that DOESN'T know their history?  The expectations are simply too high to actually pull off a film of any substance.  All the digital effects, rubbery suits (aliens seem to bounce, which I don't recall them doing before), and stumpy actors (Predators look...chubby), can't save the film.

After seeing Dreamcatcher just before, it's enough to give fans...""the Ripley.""",1133481600,3,4657,4.769712140175219
1564519,3,B00005JMZK,"To start, I like the Alien series and the Predator series, but I wasn't expecting anything from this film.  In fact, I put it off until one night a buddy and I were bored out of our minds and couldn't decide on anything else to watch.  We were both pleasantly surprised, and he's pretty rough on movies, especially sequels.

Anyway, the plot problems have been hashed over in these reviews time and again, so I won't go into that part of it.  I thought that the storyline was a good idea - reminiscent of Stargate and that it was executed in an entertaining - if not always technically correct - manner.  One thing it could definitely have used more of is character development.  Although there is a nod to strong female archetype so well done with Ripley here...

I found the pacing to be sharp.  The story, although contrived and not always hitting everything it should, is certainly more thought out and fun than many sci-fi flicks in recent memory (Star Wars Prequels anyone?)

Going in expecting nothing made this movie stand out quite a bit.  It certainly isn't the caliber of Aliens, or Alien, but it's a fun movie to watch if you just relax and let it happen.  I now want to see the directors cut to fill in the blanks with the growth hormone explanation - that was really the only thing that bothered me (The Aliens growing so quickly).  Although, even in the first Alien, we end up with an 8 ft. monster that seems to grow pretty fast... so maybe everyone is just being nitpicky here.

I'd rate this a 3.5 out of 5 since the movie is entertaining, and it involves two well known and liked off-world creatures.  Rounding down to 3 because 1) Amazon still amazingly doesn't have half-points and 2) I'm not going to round up due to the technical issues and non-R rating.",1133395200,,1777,4.478260869565218

The first disappointment was the film itself, and its PG-13 rating, which in no way matched up to its hype, and the trailer basically showed all the good parts of the movie so there was no real reason to see it if you saw the trailer.  But I can accept the fact that not every movie is great.  I can live with it being PG-13 as long as the plot is good, and seeing as it had awesome special effects and the monsters looked their best, I can live with the movie as it stands.

After we've come to terms with the film as it is, we are then given the second disappointment: the first DVD release.  The back cover claims that there is the theatrical version, and some extended version with an alternate opening.  I immediately got my hopes up, thinking there might be some more gore or something, but it turned out to be a fifteen second waste of time.  I can understand why the scene was cut out, and it should have stayed cut out.  Plus, the DVD has basically no good bonus features except the audio commentary.  The behind the scenes featurette included was accesible on the internet before the movie even hit theaters.

If you do the math sofar, one movie ticket, plus popcorn and a soda, not to mention the stinker DVD, we're talking close to forty bucks already tossed on this movie.  But apparently Fox wants more, as they've just realeased the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" version of the film.  Finally, right?  Eh...  I just got a copy, and boy, this was the biggest of the three disappointments.  Shame on me for wasting the extra 25 bucks on it, I should have waited until it was OnDemand.  Well anyhow, the so-called ""unrated"" version features that same terrible alternate opening, a few extra boring minutes of scenes that were cut on purpose, and some really, REALLY bad digitally enhanced ""blood"" effects inserted all throughout the movie.  At least the movie looked believable before, but now we've got these ridiculous red stains all over the screen that in no way look like real blood.  And this is supposed to be unrated???

The term ""Unrated"" is supposed to refer to the rating classification just above ""R"" and just below ""X""... sort of an alternate name for ""NC-17"", as opposed to the term ""Not Rated"", which means the footage simply wasn't rated.  Apparently the scheme was to simply not rate the extra eight minutes of talk, add some crappy digital blood effects, and call it ""Unrated"", when it really should have been called ""Not Rated"".  Cannibal Holocaust is unrated.  Dawn of the Dead is unrated.  AVP: Unrated Director's cut is NOT unrated by any means.  If the MPAA had bothered to sit down and watch it (apparently they had the brains not to) but if they had, it would still have gotten the PG-13 rating.  Don't be fooled, and don't waste your hard-earned money like I did, please!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does have some decent special features on disc 2, but not worth 20 bucks.",1133049600,15,3153,4.534513274336283
1564521,3,B00005JMZK,"I was planning on responding to the 'big 16' that I see always when looking at this movie.  I didn't think it was classic, but neither was Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, or Predator 2.  They were energetic and fun.  And let's be honest, that's kinda what we want.

But I was beaten to the answers, but gonna do my own anyway...cause I'm bored.

Let's be honest. Paul W.S. ""Worthless Sh-t"" Anderson has proven time and time again that he is incapable of making a movie that could even remotely be considered good.

 - I kinda disagree.  MK was dumb fun back in the day.  I liked Event Horizon (but I'm a gore-hound so there ya go) Resident Evil was really fun.  Solider had a few moments.  He's no Cameron, but I've seen much worse.

1) Lance Henriksen, who played Bishop in Aliens, plays a human in this movie. What Paul Anderson forgot was that Lance also played Bishop's creator (a Human character) in Alien 3, at least 300 years into the future. Whoopsie! Oh sure, there are those who say Lance's character in Alien 3 was an android, but androids don't bleed red. Next.

 - This is VERY debatable.  There has never been an agreement by Alien fans if the Alien 3 Weyland was the real Weyland.  Also it could have been a very, very distant relative.  Or even a clone?  This isn't that much of a stretch.  And Anderson didn't 'forget' this fact...come on now.  Also, Lance needed some green.

2) During the mission briefing, there is talk of the pyramid containing elements from 3 different cultures. The premise is that the Egyptians, Cambodians, etc. learned things like written language from the predators. However, if this is the case, then why does the predator pyramid use 3 different Human languages instead of Humans using the predator language?

 - They learned things like written language...did it ever say the PREDATOR'S written langauge?  Nope.  We are lead to believe that the Predator's simply helped them along in learning things quicker than evolution would have provided.  As many people believed happened to the Egyptians.

3) If a hunt gone awry is what wiped out the Aztecs, then presumably the Antarctic pyramid wouldn't have been the only one used for hunts, yet the Egyptian and Cambodian pyramids don't have any depictions of aliens or predators like the Antarctic one does.

 - I would assume (granted I have no evidence) that each culture only had one hunt-pyramid.  The Egyptian pyramid used for hunts may have been long since buried in the sand and the Camodian one may have not been found or maybe both were victims of ""hunts gone awry.""  This is very plausable.

4) Though the pyramid is buried under 2,000 feet of ice, it was apparently built on dirt, back when Antarctica was much warmer. But continents don't move thousands of miles in just a few thousand years. The last time that pyramid saw sky would have been millions of years before humans inhabited the planet.

 - Uhhhh....yep...this didn't make much sense.  I'll give ya that.  My only guess is that we are dealing with a much, much, much more technoligicly advanced species.  They might have dug down years ago and created this temple themselves, then covered it up.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised at this, since so many other hunts went wrong, maybe they built one under the ice, so in case they had to blow it the heck up, it wouldn't kill a ton of humans that are now becoming more advanced.

5) The predators only come to Earth every 100 years? Well then, what the heck were Danny Glover and the Governator fighting against?

 - From what I can tell, they only come to Earth every hundred years to train in the Pyramids.  Once a Predator has become a true hunter and ""graduated"" so to speak, he can then make his own trips to Earth and hunt freely.

6) The predators come to Earth to hunt Aliens, and we're just chow for the critters? That also contradicts the past two Predator movies, in which the preds come to Earth to hunt Humans, not Aliens.

 - Once again...it seems to me that the young Predator's come to hunt Aliens to prove they are worthy hunters then move on to Humans.  If you had trained to use a gun, but never gone hunting before what would you hunt first?  One that can shoot back or one that can't?  While Aliens are fast and deadly, they are only smart to an extent.  With their weapons, the Predators can make quick work of a few Aliens.  BUT...Humans, with training and weapons are much more dangerous.  Both Arnold and Glover took one out.

7) The Predators store their shoulder cannons inside the pyramid, but they bring all their other weapons with them from the ship. Not only does this not make sense, but it again contradicts the Predator films in which the Preds bring all of their weapons - shoulder cannons included - with them from their ships.

 - Once again this does NOT contradict the other films, since you missed the point that the three Predators that came to hunt in this film are proving themselves.  The test here is to ""get"" to the weapons.  They are not gonna walk in fully loaded or it wouldn't be a challenge.  BUT...if they walk in with zero weapons they would probably get slaughtered.  Thus why it's half and half.

8) Sebastian says the Aztec calendar was metric, based on powers of ten. This is a big steaming cow patty. The Aztec calendar was actually based on 13 and 20. Of course, the bigger question is why you'd have to input the date at all to retrieve your weapons, when it would be much easier to just push a button.

 - Well, I didn't know the Aztec calander was metric or based on 13 or whatever.  No idea.  BUT...my guess would be that you would enter some kind of code to prevent the rare case that some human monkey would get into the chamber and press your ""easy button"" and take their weapons.  And since that IS what happened in this flick, and we saw the carnage that ensued...it was a good idea.

9) The Queen lays egg after egg after egg. Where's all this bio-mass coming from? The Nostromo had food stores, Hadley's Hope and Fury 161 were certainly abundant feeding grounds, and the bugs on the Auriga were deliberately fed, but what are the pyramid aliens eating? Is there a giant tank of alien kibble inside the pyramid somewhere? If so, why do the Aliens bother venturing anywhere else?

Let's see, are the Predator's retards?  Nope, I'm sure they feed her lots and lots...then froze her ass.  I think someone said they do explain this a little more in the Unrated edition I haven't watched yet.  It supposedly explains why they grew so fast.

10) There are more Aliens in this movie than there are hosts... heh heh...

 - I don't know.  I didn't count.  Don't forget they didn't just get the ones in the sacrafical chamber...they also got some of the soliders lurking around.

11) The predators are supposed to bring hosts to the Sacrificial Chamber before the hunt can begin. Instead, they just enter the pyramid without bringing hosts. Paul Anderson tries to explain this contradiction away by saying that the heatplume was bait for the human expedition, but that contradicts the whole Sacrificial Chamber concept, and doesn't make sense because we wouldn't be able to detect said bait until today.

 - The Predators USED to bring willing hosts to the chamber back in the day.  Since it's been a long time and the temple is frozen over (which I did agree made little since other than to isolate our victims) they had to help them along a little bit.  I would  wager to say this pyramid was pretty much abandonded.  Have ya ever been walking in the woods and seen an old treestand?  Well just because it hasn't been used in a long time doesn't mean the guy that put it up couldn't come back to it if deer was in the area.  It seemed the Preds just took advantage of the situation, and saw it as another chance to hunt.

12) The Pyramid shifts every ten minutes. Except for the part where it shifts twice in the span of 3 minutes and doesn't shift at all for the second half of the movie.

 - Well, this may be a bit ilogical, but no different than when movies show a bomb counting down and it's sitting at 30 seconds...and 30 seconds later it's on 15 seconds.  This is more nitpicking than anything.

13) The Queen, in order to get free from her restraints, has the warrior aliens bite lots of holes in her so her acid blood dissolves her restraints. But why doesn't she have the aliens impale themselves? And why does she wait so long to do this instead of doing it ASAP? And as soon as the Queen is set free, she decides to run out of and away from the pyramid, without any real reason. I dunno about you, but it seemed to me that she had a pretty cozy spot right where she was. The pyramid made a perfect hive and there was no shortage of food, so why would she leave?

 - Before I say anything....look at what you just posted.  You said earlier that there was NO food storage that you could see...but now you state there is plenty of food.  Eh?  Certainly you don't mean the humans...not enough food there.  See how easy it is to contradict yourself and say something ilogical?  Anyway.  I guess she saw no need to kill one of them to save herself.  Aliens are tough and she knew it would hurt but not kill her.  And she was frozen for who knows how long.  It might have taken her a second to get her head together and for the other Aliens to find her.  They communicate...but not through telepathy, at least not that the other movies have mentioned.  Also, the fact that three Preds were running around might not make her want to rush out until she knew they were taken care of.  Remember, the third was implanted by this time, and she knew it, so she wasn't concerned with him.  As for running outside.  Lets see...if you were in jail for most of your life and you got free...would you just chill out and stick around?  Or would you bug out as soon as possible.  I think you'd leave.

14) The Preds' masks can see aliens inside the hosts. So why didn't they see the alien inside the surviving Pred that they brought aboard their ship? Seriously, if you were a pred and you wanted to bring a fellow pred on board your ship after he'd just spent a day in an alien hive, wouldn't you check him for implanted aliens first?

 - They can only see inside the hosts using one of their helmet visions...not all the time.  Or maybe they saw it and wanted to keep it for future hunts?  How can we question another species motives?  They might be planning on checking him as soon as they get to a safer distance from Earth.  It wasn't the top priority at the time.  AND let's not forget this little Alien/Predator is on a ship FULL of armed Preds!  Not like he's going anywhere.

15) Speaking of the masks... if they can't stop an alien's inner jaw from ramming through your skull, why bother with masks at all? I can understand goggles for the vision modes, but you don't wear a full-blown helmet except for protection.

 - They can't stop the biting attack...but they do stop the claws, as seen in the movie.  Predators don't wear ""goggles"" they wear helmets.  End of story.

16) The time required for an Alien to grow into the next stage of its lifecycle is determined by whatever is most convenient from a storytelling perspective, rather than by any sort of precedent set by the other 4 Alien movies. For example, in Alien 1-4, there was at least a day in between implantation and ""birth"". In AvP, that time is anywhere from a day to 3 minutes. Another example: the fact that the eggs were all laid at least a few second apart from each other doesn't stop them from hatching all at the same time (Resurrection also had this problem, but at least in that movie it wasn't scripted).

 - Once again, this is covered in the Unrated edition from what I read.  Does that make it better?  Not really, but it makes more sense.

Problem is you expected WAY too much.  Yes, as the movie going public, it's our right to dislike a movie and voice our opinion.  Which is why I voiced mine.  I think you wanted some kind of 3 hour epic creating new and exciting characters and then finding some way to add the Aliens and Preds to the story.  Use a ton more built sets and less CGI.  And of course make it a hard ""R"" and go from there.  I would have liked that too...but that would have cost $150 million plus to make it even decent.  And that's a ton of money to invest in two dead franchises.  We were lucky to get what we did.",1132704000,12,12389,4.4398579671549046
1564522,4,B00005JMZK,"For those of you who see ""AVP Unrated"" and think ""Blood, Gore, Language, Violence, and Nudity""...THINK AGAIN!

Where there was a few flecks of blood, there is now a gallon. Where there were two ""campy"" scenes, there is now only one, But this is not even an ""R"" rating version of the film, evidenced further by the PG-13 rating on the back of the DVD case.

This fild should have stuck with the ""Director's Cut"" name and cut out the ""Unrated"" label, since in my opinion it does not deserve it. If you can swallow the plausability of the story even a litte bit, the this version is more serious and bloodier than the theatrical release, but not by much. ""Campy"" scenes still abound. Extra footage, edited in Deleted scenes from the Theatrical DVD version and a few other scene changes make this version a lot more fun to own than the first, but hard core fans of the original movies may still find this title a little wimpy.

With all that negative feedback out of the way, if you take a more objective, ""outside the box"" outlook on the film, it is fun and is a good mix of sci-fi and action. I would heartilly recommend this version over the standard AVP Theatrical version, and you will pretty much find all the original Theatrical DVD Extras included in this edition as well. (Commentaries, Making of featurette, etc.)",1132704000,31,1319,4.533613445378151
1564523,3,B00005JMZK,"Some of the points by ""Gregorius"" are valid. Others aren't.

2) Most likely they learned pyramid building and were brought to Antarctica to help build this one.

3) The decorations would only have been in the actual hunt pyramids. Said pyramids were nuked when the Predators lost.

4) The Predator's have highly advanced technology. They could have melted enough ice, built the pyramid then covered it back up.

5) You are confusing the purpose of each visit. The Predators in the first two movies were proven hunters out to collect some trophies. The ones in this movie are trained but unproven. They've come to be tested for worthiness. Consider it as being like a high school final exam - it only comes once a year. The Predators come here every hundred years to let their rookies prove themselves or die in the attempt. It's possible they have other testing grounds on different planets.

6) Again, these are rookies Predators being tested against the toughest enemies the Predator's know about - the Aliens. Like an exam you are tested at a higher level than what you might normally expect to encounter.

7) Notice how the shoulder cannons are different in this film? These are much stronger than the normal laser blasters. They are designed for killing Aliens who are much stronger and harder to kill than humans. The Predators have to prove themselves worthy of having the shoulder cannons by retrieving them. Having them from the start would make it too easy.

9) You can argue the same point for any of the Alien movies. The Nostromo may have had food stores but I think they'd have noticed if the Alien broke in and chowed down.

11) Different times, different circumstances. When the Predators first came to Earth they were dealing with primative humans. That's no longer the case and the Predator's no longer reveal themselves so openly. The early humans who were sacrificed could be considered fair trade for what the Predator's gave their race. The humans now would have to be tricked and possibly given a fair chance. The Predator's knew they'd come in armed after all.

13) The Queen isn't dumb. She'd know the Predator's were most likely to nuke the temple since there no longer enough of them to win the hunt. She had to get out of there ASAP. She isn't crazy enough to take on a Predator with a shoulder cannon by herself though and needed her warriors to act as cannon fodder. Getting stabbed didn't restrict her fighting ability either.

15) The masks are part vison enhancing, part life support and part body armour. The last part would be for normal enemies with weaker weapons. It's the same logic as to why they didn't go into the temple with their shoulder cannons and other heavy weapons - they had to prove themselves using limited equipment first. Likewise, the Predator armour was vulnerable to the Alien's acid blood - they'd surely be able to make something acid proof if they wanted to.

16) They might have been specially modified for faster propagation. If they produced at normal speeds the Predator's could have annihilated them before they'd even left the body of their host.",1132617600,6,3113,4.767657992565056

1564566,3,B00005JMZK,"Since the Alien and Predator series ended, we all knew that there would be an ""Alien vs. Predator"".  But who knew the average viewer (i.e. me) would find so many mistakes...

-Alexa's ""warrior"" marking on her left cheek disappears in overhead shots.
-When Alexa and the Predator are running from the explosion, across the whaling station, her ""shield"" changes hands.
-The full moon for October 2004 would be on the 28th, not the 10th.
-The large pulley and winch setup for lowering equipment and people down the ice tunnel completely disappears when the equipment sled comes rocketing back out. If it was in place, the sled would have slammed right into it.
-Icebreakers have round prows, not angled ones.
-The film gives confusing and inconsistent accounts of the geology of the area around the pyramid. It is supposedly buried under 2,000 feet of ice on an island, yet the pure-ice tunnel leading down to it begins at sea-level (as proved by the existence of the whaling station at the upper end). The whaling station is thus supposedly built on ice instead of rock; this is a ludicrous proposition as it would only be constructed in a region where ice melted enough each summer to allow whaling ships to dock. Anything built on ice that thaws significantly each year would not last 100 years. This arrangement also places the pyramid and a large amount of ice below sea-level; the buoyancy and natural flow of the ice pack makes this highly unlikely and not is not something that could be accurately described as an island in the first place. Further confusion is caused by the scene at the end of the film in which a large tank falls into the water and plunges hundreds of feet towards an unseen ocean floor, supposedly directly offshore.
-The story is set in October (summertime in Antarctica). It should therefore be daylight on the surface, and yet it's dark as night.
-When the Predator and Alexa turn around after the whaling station falls into the ground, the shot of them is reversed (notable by the marking and pressure tubes on the predators helmet).
-The second Predator is killed by an Alien when his head is punctured by the Alien's inner mouth. When the shot changes and the Predator tilts his head back there is no wound.
-Alexa is wearing only a thin sweater (and no hat) after the Alien burns her jacket, yet she doesn't even shiver while outdoors in Antarctica.
-The captions show the icebreaker approaching the island/pyramid from the Ross Ice Shelf. The island is in fact on the opposite side of the Antarctic continent.
-After the collapse of the whaling town, the ""T"" shape on the Predator's mask is backwards.
-Despite detailed satellite imagery of the pyramid, the expedition is surprised to find a whaling station at their intended drilling site. They must have missed this, as well as the large ship-worth bay it was undoubtedly located on: despite their haste, they choose a more remote anchorage that required a land journey over some significant elevation.
-Sebastian refers to ""the Long Count"" while describing a calendar that he refers to as ""Aztec"". The Long Count was a feature of the Mayan calendar system; the Aztec calendar, although based on the Mayan, didn't use the Long Count.
-It is said by one of the team that the whaling station is directly above the pyramid. However a geographical survey (as well as the obvious in-story shots) show that the ice tunnel slopes gently down towards the pyramid entrance, therefore not on top at all.
-Graeme Miller's description of the aurorae as being caused by protons and electrons in the atmosphere is inaccurate. The aurorae are caused by the interaction of oxygen ions with oxygen molecules in the ionosphere, leading to chemiluminescene. However, as a chemical engineer, his knowledge of atmospheric photochemistry may be expected to be somewhat rusty.
-When Alexa Woods is climbing the Lho La ice fall in Nepal, she's about 10 body-lengths from the top edge. From the moment she answers the phone she reaches the top in about six steps. You can't take steps longer then your body.
-When Alexa is climbing the Lho La ice fall in Nepal, you can see a overview of the edge where is climbing to. There is nowhere a helicopter too be seen, yet after 30 second (duration of the phone call) the helicopter manages to land, turn off the engine (spinning down rotors takes much more than 30 seconds), and let Maxwell Stafford out of the helicopter and walk towards the edge to meet Alexa.
-During the first battle, when the Alien falls to the ground after the Predator kicks it through a pillar, a wire can be seen holding its tail up.
-The legs of the practical and computer-generated Aliens don't correspond. The practical ones have human-like joints and feet, while the CG versions have an extra joint at the ankle and much longer toes.
-When the first-killed Predator is thrown to the ground, its extended wrist blades bend when they hit the ground, revealing that they are actually made of rubber.
-The characters correctly predict that the walls will move every 10 minutes, because the Aztec did everything in multiples of 10. However, the Aztec would not have known how long a minute is.
-When Alexa and the Predator are shooting up the tunnel, she isn't wearing the Alien head on her hand. She is clearly holding on with both hands. As they are thrown on the surface, the head reappears.
-The Predator cuts off the tip of the Alien's tail, spewing green acidic blood, and then tosses him through a column and into another room. As the Alien flies in slow motion, you can see that there is no blood on his stump, but immediately after, it's covered again.
-Sebastian erroneously says that the Aztec calendar was metric (based on 10). It was in fact vigesimal (based on 20) with twenty days in 18 ""months"".

1564567,2,B00005JMZK,"I was a huge fan of both the Alien and Predator movies. I even liked Pred 2 because it was a Predator movie instead of an Arnold movie (not to mention Winston's brilliant addition of an alien skull at the end which I spotted immediately upon first viewing). I have to say though that AVP absolutely sucked. It's the first one I refused to own. And not hiring Winston to do the monsters.. What the F***! He made both franchises what they were, and Anderson went with Winston's rejects who gave the predator too many teeth and a jacked-off face. I gave it two stars only because it was visually interesting sometimes and I finally got to see an alien and a predator on screen fighting. Even that ended badly. How can Colonial Marines kick ass on aliens when taken be surprise, but one alien can kill two predators who came for the express reason of hunting aliens? Major B.S. I've read the other reviews posted here, and one thing nobody touched on that is so obvious is snow. Why the hell is this set in the snow? The first two predator movies very clearly made a point of how hot it was each time the predators came. Record heat in L.A. in P2. The captive girl in P1 said and I quote, ""ONly in the hottest years this happens."" It was very clear to me that part of the predator lore was that they probably came from a very hot planet and could only tolerate being on earth during our hottest seasons. Now they are in the friggin arctic.

Well that's my two cents. With the release of the unrated edition, I hope they put some dignity back into the franchise. Screw Holliwood and their money minded producers.

1564568,2,B00005JMZK,"When a studio thinks a franchise is on its last legs, it will merge it, so pitting two well-known characters against each other. This crossover in movies or television usually indicates they've run out of ideas. An example of this is the recent Freddy Versus Jason.

The showdown of Alien Vs Predator has been touted for a long time. There is already a great story in a highly successful comic book series. Instead of touching on it, the filmmakers have come back to present day, and are giving us the origins of the Alien movie series.

A satellite owned by billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, precursing both the android Bishop and the Weyland-Yutani Corporation from the earlier films) uncovers a pyramid buried deep under the Antarctic ice. He finances a group of heavily armed explorers and scientists led by Lex (Sanaa Lathan) to go and claim its secrets. There are no prizes for guessing what's waiting for them.

Director Paul W. S. Anderson is a good set designer, and gets the tone of the movie done just right. For some reason, the Alien movies don't use much CGI, and this is no exception. The first pitfall is the fast Alien gestation period, which is now minutes, instead of hours. It is inconsistent even throughout the film. Also, to achieve a tame enough film rating means the gore is scaled back to almost nothing.

This is nowhere near as good as the other films in either series, but it might be something you'd like to see. The final scenes are entertaining, even if they did made me think the film had become Jurassic Park on Ice.",1132012800,3,1583,4.703971119133574

In terms of scariness the movie gave some frightening scenes but no gore, or blood like the classics. Alot of people complained about the plot but please think about this- since when did the Alien movies or Predator movies have any plot? I mean seriously, the main line of both is basically- make it out alive. In AVP there is more than just make it out alive, they show past of both Predator and Alien, they have a strong female lead and for once some real kick butt action.

The movie could have expanded much more on the characters instead of hiring a bunch of extras to play the parts.

There are some moments in the film that redeem the entire effort. These scenes are brief but demand for me a second viewing.

I was a bit disappointed that the fights between the aliens and predators were not very long or to many of them.  I was hoping for a big fight that would last a while, but most of them were extremely quick.  It was still entertaining but with the pg-13 rating it was obvious this movie was not going to be what it could have been.",1131840000,2,500,4.123711340206185

Predator""You cant really expect a really awesome plot and this movie doesnt give you that, but what it does give you is a decent story and some pretty cool fight scenes between the alien and predator. This movie also did really good in theaters and only has somewhat of a bad rep because it didn't live up to AvP fanboy expectations.a couple of reviews ago someone had mentioned that the movie bombed and the directors cut was ""only released to feed the cast and crews family"" but the fact is the movie did not bomb and it is not by any means a horrible movie.i mean come on do dome research before you start poppin of you mouth pretending you know things.

""Event Horizon"" was one of my favorites. Some people say there were flaws in the movie but what Anderson did was take all the back ground info. about AvP namely games, comics, and novels and used that to make a very original story incorporating all of the material. Anderson also said in one of his many online interviews before the film was released that he didn't want this film to be linked to the films in the franchises, that he wanted it to be a seperate entity from the others. Which I must say was very entertaining. I am looking forward to this unrated Directors cut as long as it has scenes included that make sense. The acting isn't that great but lets face it we didn't pay to see the people act on screen we payed to see the royal rumble of franchise titans. So to conclude my point. If you are a fan of either franchise and want to be entertained I would highly reccomend this flick.",1131408000,2,1065,4.2254901960784315

I LUV ""ALIEN"".. ALL THE WAY BACK FROM WHEN MY DEMENTED FATHER BROUGHT ME TO SEE IT WHEN I WAS ONLY 7 YEARS OLD!! I HATE PREDATOR! ALWAYS HAVE, ALWAYS WILL! MY HATE FOR PREDATOR DID NOT DETURE ME FROM SEE THIS FILM IN THE THEATER THOUGH, IT WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING PREDATOR GET CREAMED BY THE ALIENS FOR ME! I KNEEEEEW THIS FILM WAS GOING TO BE BAAAAAD! I KNEW IT, BUT STILL WENT & STILL BOUGHT IT JUST THE SAME.. I WOULD HAVE LIKED THIS FILM MORE HAD ALL THE HUMANS BEEN KILLED IN THE FIRST 10 SECONDS OV THE FILM & THE REST OV THE SHOW WAS JUST ALIENS & PREDATORS DUKING IT OUT!! I MEAN, COME ON, THE TITLE IS ""ALIEN VS PREDATOR"" NOT ""ALIEN VS PREDATOR VS A BUNCH OV ANNOYING, NO TALENT HUMANS""

THIS FILM HAS SOOO MANY FLAWS IN IT, I COULD WRITE A NOVEL! BUT I STILL LUVED IT, ON THE HIGH-CHEESE LEVEL.. MOSTLY.. MOSTLY JUST TO SEE A BUNCH OV ALIENS..

I HAVE A COUPLE POINTS TO BRING OUT IN THE OPEN & THEN I'LL SHUT UP..

1. WAS THIS A FAIR FIGHT?

ABSOLUTELY NOT!! STUPID HAIRFARMER PREDATOR HAS TONS OV TECHNICAL DEVICES & ARMOR & WEAPONS! ALIEN HAS NONE! WHAT COWARDS THEY ARE! THEY CAN'T EVEN FIGHT LIKE A MAN! THE WHOLE POINT OV THIS RIDICULOUS FILM WAS THAT PREDATORS ARE DROPPED OFF IN THE PYRAMID TO PROVE THEMSELVES AS WARRIORS AS A RIGHT OV PASSAGE INTO MANHOOD! PREDATOR, YOU ARE A COWARD! PUT DOWN ALL YOUR WEAPONS & DEVICES & STEP BACK IN THE RING, WE'LL SEE JUST HOW LONG YOU LAST! COWARD!

2. UHHHH, JUST HOW MANY HUMANS WENT DOWN THERE?

THERE WERE SOOOOO MANY ALIENS ALL THE SUDDEN AND I'M JUST REALLY CURIOUS WHERE ALL THE HUMAN HOSTS CAME FROM?? ..AND DAMN, JUST HOW FAST DID THESE ALIENS GROW TO FULL FORM! IT WAS LIKE SECONDS!

3. THE TIMELINE EXPLANATIONS

THEY ARE ALL JUST WRONG.. NONE OV THEM MATCH UP WHAT SO EVER.. ESPECIALLY BISHOP, IF HE WAS A ""HUMAN"" IN THIS TIMELINE, THEN THAT WOULD MAKE HIM QUITE A FEW HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE APPEARED AS A ""HUMAN"" AT THE END OV ""ALIEN 3""

4. WHO REALLY WON?

ALIEN.. IN MY BOOK THEY WON. THAT RIDICULOUS HYBRID THAT POPS OUT OV THE HAIRFARMER'S CHEST SAYS IT ALL.. I DO PROMISE YOU THAT IF THEY MAKE A SEQUAL WITH A BUNCH OV ALIEN/HAIRFARMER HYBRIDS RUNNING AROUND, I WILL WALK DOWN TO THE STUDIO AND SET FIRE TO IT!

*HIGHLIGHT OV THE MOVIE

""WHALE BONES""

HA-HA-HA-HA! OH MY GOD, THE SCENE WHEN THEY PASS BY A HUGE MASS OV BONES SHAPED LIKE A WHALE AND SHE SAYS ""WHALE BONES"".... WELL, YEAH.. NO, I THOUGHT THEY WERE CHICKEN BONES.. OH MAN, WHEN SHE SAID WHALE BONES, ME & THE OTHER 5 PEOPLE THAT MADE IT THROUGH THE FIRST 20 MINUTES OV THE FILM & STAYED, WERE LAUGHING SO HARD THAT WE FILLED THE THEATER WITH URINE!

Not even the teenagers like me want to see this toned down crap! I regret seeing this movie and sadly even if this movie was rated R in theaters it still would have gotten only three stars from me. The plot was plain stupid and when the chick teamed up with the predator i was ready to walk out of the theater. Overall a bad movie either way.,1131148800,4,465,4.010752688172043
1564635,5,B00005JMZK,"I always wanted to see the Aliens movies when I was growing up, but was never able because of the R rating. You see, my religion teaches that people shouldn't watch R-rated movies--even if you are 18 or older (that's not to say that people don't watch them, they're just not supposed to). Anyway, when this came out with a PG-13 rating, I was simply elated. I felt like my ship had finally come in. But then I had to still wait a few months before I could watch the movie. My wife didn't want to see it, so I had to wait until she was gone for a few days so I could rent it. Oh man, what a great experience. This movie is the most wonderful thing to happen to cinema since M. Night Shylamanadingdong's ""The Village.""

1564636,2,B00005JMZK,"ALIEN VS. PREDATOR has an interesting idea and some cool special effects...but they shouldn't have been so quick to kill off all the human characters.  The scruffy space crew of ALIEN and the steroid mercs of PREDATOR helped make those films the classics that they are.

First blown opportunity: when the commando tumbles down the ice shaft, he lands covered in ice and snow--reminding me of Arnold covered in mud in the first PREDATOR and concealing him.  So why couldn't the commando have survived to keep some human element in the story?  Why couldn't the Predators have missed him like they did Arnold?

Instead, the people are dispatched with little imagination.  And the movie suffers.  Or, I guess I should say, the audience suffers.",1130544000,3,740,4.919354838709677

While I am not a huge fan of your basic slasher horror movie, I am a big fan of movie sci-fi like scary flicks like Pitch Black.  I was pleasantly suprised with this one.  Many of the reviews are quite negative, and I'm afraid I'm never quite in the mainstream.  But as I don't go all out critical of movies, I usually just think if I found it entertaining and didn't consider it a waste of time, then I liked it.  Funnily enough, I watched this with my mom and she enjoyed it too.  I thorougly enjoyed the special effects and even if the mythology behind movie had holes, I didn't know any different or care.  I really liked the direction the story moved in the last third or so of the movie because I thought it was a new and different way to go.

1564639,1,B00005JMZK,"This movie hangs out with Wing Commander and The Prince and Me on weekends, and it could never get a date with House of the Dead. With that said, this is one of the worst films to ever grace a theater.

It was so appallingly bad that the only conclusion I can draw about why it was so bad is that the major studios think the average John Q. Public is a knuckle-dragging caveman. The amount of money spent on ""blockbusters"" these days is pornographic, and to make matters worse, this is what they churn out: a horribly acted, plotless, worthless cgi-fest of an attempt at cashing in on a franchise name.

I personally was excited about this film when it was first announced. Sure, I thought it might not be ""good"" in the coffee house sense, or even ""good"" in the summer movie sense... and that would be ok! I wouldn't mind an over-acted action flick. But alas, this movie was utter torture to see. Ridiculous ""facts,"" bizarre explainations of bizarre happenings, no character development, barely any speech, and a laughable scene near the end of the movie with a human and a predator out running an explosion together. With the physics of outrunning explosions aside, the overwhelming hilarity of the characters' expressions paired with the culminating music in this scene is vomit enducing enough to make me never enter a movie theater again.

In closing I will leave you with this:

NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE! Do not support horrid films.",1129507200,5,1434,4.678571428571429
1564640,2,B00005JMZK,"I haven't seen the Director's Cut version of the movie but suffice to say that this movie is average.  I have to give the Director credit for coming up with a logical plot to link Predator and Alien together.  Humans in this movie bring it home to the meaning, ""at the wrong place, at the wrong time"".  The entourage of explorers entered into the ""forbidden zone"" is an alibi to add to the headcounts and to keep the movie rolling along.  I really have to say that the nature of this movie is to make money and everything seems to be well-thought off by the studio.  One of the reviewers said it well that the age is pushed down to thirteen so that it would entice more audience and thus, profitability.  Then, you think of the additions of cast such as Lance Henriksen, who is there to entice and appease the original Alien's fan and then, there's Raoul Bova, arguably one of the more famous Italian actor and is certainly there to appeal to the European market.  Sanaa, the African American lead character and a younger and more dynamic version of Ripley plays quite an okay role but she doesn't have Sigourney's charisma and weight to carry the movie upon her shoulder.  Anderson, the director is good in making a straight up movie and he doesn't have the gravita of James Cameron, the moody appeal of David Fincher and Ridley Scott.  In the interview, he said it himself that the earlier versions of Alien and Predator franchises are classics and the last thing he wants to do is to bastardising the franchise and because of that, his reservation can only produce a half baked and unsatisfactory AVP movie.  His poster shots and the close up shots of Alien and Predator hitting on with one another are commendable but they don't make the total sum of the whole movie.  Overall, a could have been movie.  I find the making and the interview more intriguing than the movie itself.  However, on a wet and cold day, it's quite a nice way to spend an afternoon all alone.  Commendable effort.",1129507200,2,1991,4.540616246498599
1564641,1,B00005JMZK,"Stuck in development hell for what seemed like an eternity, Fox's Alien and Predator franchises are finally slapped together in this just plain awful Alien VS Predator.  And naturally, who better than hack Paul W.S. Anderson to write and direct this?  For starters, as a few previous reviewers already mentioned, there are so many non-sensical plot devices (if the Predators come to Earth every 100 years, then what were Arnie and Danny Glover fighting in the first two Predator movies) that the film tries to make little sense at all.  One thing that particularly bothered me here, is that right after the Alien facehuggers impregnated the hosts, they immediately birthed an Alien.  Am I wrong, or didn't it take at least a few hours for an Alien to gestate inside it's host before it was born?  If this wasn't the case, then John Hurt would have been dead right after the facehugger came off him, and would have never made it to dinner.  Not to mention Sigourney Weaver would have never lived long enough to kill herself in Alien 3, and would have been dead as soon as she crash landed on Fury 161.  The dialogue is atrocious, and the cast, besides Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner and good 'ol Lance Henriksen, is bad as well.  The only good points of AVP are some imaginitive production designs, and the Predators look as cool as ever, but that's it.  To sustain a PG-13 rating, which no film in either series ever got, there was a good bit of gore cut out of the film which many are hoping will be fully restored for the upcoming Unrated version of the film to be released on DVD, but added gore scenes aren't going to save this.  Let's all take the time to thank Paul W.S. Anderson (nice job on what an above reviewer interpreted the W.S. to stand for) for delivering another mainstream aimed schlock fest, and naturally, there's a shameless door being left open for a sequel (or two, or three).",1128816000,7,1897,4.602373887240356
1564642,5,B00005JMZK,"Having heard a lot of bad things about this flick, I went into this with very low expectations. Having enjoyed EVENT HORIZON and RESIDENT EVIL, the only reason I gave this a look is because I like Paul Anderson's direction. I was not disappointed. I know I'm mostly alone here, but that's okay. I like the fact that I don't think like the masses who are not always that educated when it comes to filmmaking anyway. Even though people vilify Anderson's directing talents, I love the high-tech look of his films and the art directors and cinematographers he employs. I don't get the criticism that's directed towards this guy. I'm 45 years old and I've been a film fanatic all my life. I own everything from CASABLANCA to FILM NOIR to GANDHI to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA to DAWN OF THE DEAD, and I think I can tell good filmmaking from bad. This is not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA by any means, but Paul Anderson is surely an underrated filmmaker in his chosen genre of sci-fi horror. Anderson has a unique style all his own that reminds me of early John Carpenter. After watching this flick and listening to him on the RESIDENT EVIL extras, he seems like a totally cool guy that I would love to hang out with.

I won't go into the plot here. Read other reviews for that. What I want to talk about is Anderson's directing style. One of the things I'd love to ask him is, ""Man, how did you do that?"" I'm talking about the shot where the camera pans back about 2000 feet into a giant ice tunnel the Predators have made from space. I know it was done with computer CGI, but it looked so real it took my breath away. I love the way he uses backward camera pans with special effects. He's one of the best there is at this technique. I love the beginning shot of the satelite slowly opening in shadow only to reveal itself in the light from the Earth. It rivals any sci-fi shot of space I've ever seen. Visually spectacular. It also parallels his beautiful shot of the menacing UMBRELLA satelite from RESIDENT EVIL. Camera placement in this film is incredible, and proves to me that Anderson could very well direct mainstream epics, drama, suspense, film noir, or just about anything else his little heart desires. (I hope he never goes in those directions, because he's so good at sci-fi horror.) Examples of Anderson's framing: the shot from a hole in the ground below an explorer into the sky as the Predator ship passes over his unsuspecting head. A shot as good as anything from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS that suggests the unseen terror of the Predators coming to Earth. A shot from the Alien's POV (point of view) as slime drips in front of the camera and it's tail slowly comes into view. Sorry, not even Cameron used a shot like this. Another shot through a Predators inviso-camo sword placed right in front of the camera. The Predator films always use Predator POV, but not quite like Anderson uses it here. Another shot I love is the high wide angle shot where an invisible Predator jumps across the moving pyramid as the team below is firing automatics into the darkness above. Then, a great edit of wasted spent casings dropping to the floor. One of the most incredible shots in this film is the shot of the Facehuggers jumping in a slowed down camera speed across the room towards their intended victims. Then, the shot resumes normal speed as a Facehugger attaches itself to a hapless female human without an edit. WITHOUT AN EDIT, FOLKS!! Again, ""How did you do that?"" They might have run the camera in reverse. I hope Anderson talks about it in the Special features. I know this is blasphemy, but this one shot alone surpasses anything from Cameron's ALIENS or any other ALIEN flick I've seen. Remarkable stuff and very artfully done. Don't get me wrong, ALIENS is still the best in series. And the only thing missing from this film that made ALIENS so great was the junp-out-of-your-seat frights that Cameron employed so well. I didn't miss it, because there was a lot of slime and Alien/Predator gore in this one. With more to come this November. Yay!! I do consider Anderson to be somewhat of an arty director, so it's somewhat understandable that most people don't enjoy his work. Most of my older friends who understand filmmaking like his work too. Me, I love this guy.

The special effects are tour de force with great CGI. I never expected to see an Alien Queen, but she's there. Thousands of Aliens scurrying up a pyramid in CGI is something we've never seen in the Alien series. I don't know about you, but I thought it was heavy metal wicked. Shoot, Virgil, I'm in sci-fi hog heaven!!

The story is clever and better than I expected. I figured this would be just another sci-fi special effects action shoot-out extravaganza that would make little or no sense. I understand 20TH Century edited this for a PG rating and there are holes. The complaints about the part of the story where the Predators need to retrieve their weapons inside the Alien prison making no sense? Maybe the Predators dropped them off for maintenance when they got the call from Earth. Maybe the ones on board had spent fuel cells. Maybe the ones on earth are special Alien killers with anti-splatter settings. Hah!! Who knows? When you're watching this type of film there's a lot of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. And filling in the blanks with your own exposition is part of the fun. Especially, when you're watching with friends. Don't take it so seriously. The story took a turn that I was not expecting when one of the humans is accepted as a warrior by a Predator. Come on, a Predator fashions an Alien skull and tail weapon and gives it to a human? Great twist, man. I want one too!! It's a clever plot twist and one that I hope they utilize in a sequel. Humans and Predators fighting side by side to rid the Universe of those nasty Aliens. They could call it ALIEN VS PREDATOR EARTH: BATTLE OF THE WARRIOR RACES. The people who are bitching remind me of a Trekkie nerd I used to work with who was upset with Lucas for explaining The Force in STAR WARS with a scientific explanation via metachlorians or some such. Weirdo!! ""Who cares. It ain't CITIZEN KANE. Just have fun with it and stay away from conventions, you social misfit."" I bet he's learning Predator speak right now for the next convention. I know he speaks Klingon.

The ending is fun, leaving it open for the inevitable sequel. Quite funny too.

THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST SCI-FI HORROR MONSTER MOVIES IN RECENT MEMORY. AND A WELCOME ADDITION TO THE ALIEN/PREDATOR UNIVERSE. FORGET THE CRITICS AND JUST ENJOY IT.

I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY THE UNRATED EDITION COMING OUT THIS THANKSGIVING. THIS WILL MAKE A GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR THAT HARD TO BUY FOR SCI-FI GORE HOUND ON YOUR LIST. YES!! MORE GORE FOR THE HOLIDAYS. WHAT A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.",1128816000,12,6797,4.553556827473426

1564707,2,B00005JMZK,"""Alien vs. Predator"" brings together the two most popular sci-fi monsters from the 1980's to duke it out in a winner-take-all battle.  The question is not ""who wins?"" but ""does anyone care?""

The tale begins when scientists discover an ancient pyramid mysteriously buried deep beneath the frozen surface of Antarctica.  In no time, a team of explorers and archaeologists is dispatched to the site to investigate the puzzling phenomenon.  While there, they discover that this is no ordinary ruin, but a temple established long ago by outer space aliens who have made their presence known in order to lure fresh human sacrifices into their trap.

With a premise that feels an awful lot like a warmed over version of ""The Thing,""  ""Alien vs. Predator"" spends virtually no time on character development and, instead, heads straight to the action - not an unusual course of events in a film of this kind, until one realizes that what distinguished both the original ""Alien"" and the original ""Predator"" from the typical action flick was having charismatic performers in the lead roles (Sigourney Weaver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively).  In contrast, Alexa Woods makes for a pretty wan heroine and the supporting players are not much better.  And although this film predictably registers high on the goop meter, there isn't much inspiration to be derived - even for diehard action fans - from what is, essentially, two CGI effects going at one another for nigh unto two hours.  The sad truth is that the fight scenes quickly become monotonous and boring seeing as there is nobody on screen whose fate we really care about.

About the only real surprise in this film is that the obligatory ""fake scare"" scene, usually given to a cat to deliver, is here performed by a penguin.",1127174400,3,1777,4.952861952861953
1564708,3,B00005JMZK,"I have listened to many people bad-mouth this movie for quite some time now and now I have my oppertunity to put my foot down. I will agree, this film could have been a lot better, but one factor that most people have failded to realize is that the movie served its purpose. After many years of waiting, we finaly saw an Alien and Predator face off on the screen. The plot of the film was very original for a sci-fi film and nothing like we've witnessed in an Alien or Predator movie before. It delivered what Alien 3 was supposed to, aliens on earth. It gave the veiwers and fans A larger prespective on the AVP universe. And while many fans dwell on the negativity of this film, I found many moments that were ejoyable and exciting. The action is what what I've come to expect from a film of its title... unique and original in many moments. I would suggest to purchase the directors cut availible in november for it will present more footage and alot more bonus features. This movie is definatly worth the time to watch, so grab a chair, turn off the lights, and enjoy a good Science-fiction flic!!!",1126656000,,1102,4.4068627450980395
1564709,4,B00005JMZK,"OK, this is a silly movie.  That being said, it is yet another in a long tradition of movies such as ""Frankentstein meets the Wereworlf"" or ""King Kong versus Godzilla"".  The history and science is all wrong and the action is clearly preposterous.

Those statements out of the way, this is actually a pretty good monster flick.  The effects are all good, the story is involving if predictable (you can see you will die and who will live pretty early on, but so what).

Sanaa Lathan is very effective as the lead in the movie (a female lead is a tradition in the Alien flicks).  She says all the right things, is able to pull of the physical stuff, relate to the correct monster, and do all the things a strong lead has to do.  It was also nice to see Lance Henrickson bringing his wonderful presence to another Alien film.  Note the name Charles Bishop Weyland recaps the name of his name ""Bishop"" in Aliens.  While it will help you to have seen ""Predator"" and the first two ""Alien"" films (or even all of each), you can watch this without any knowledge of the monsters.

This movie is rated PG-13 because it does scare young people and there are some swear words, and while there is fighting, killing, and some alien blood, it is not full of gore and awful human suffering as any of the original films.  The fright here more comes from anticipation and what you know just happened off screen.

So, for the kind of film it is attempting to be, it is pretty good.  Get some popcorn and enjoy it with your young teenage kids.  We watched it in the extended version and I recommend that.",1126396800,2,1582,4.391752577319588

Thats like saying you have to lower your IQ to read a book you can't understand and Just maybe you can understand it better...

That honestly tells you some thing right there people.....

Come on people the movie sucked. And this qoute ""Its just a summer pop corn movie"" That tells you somthing right there, don't see the damn film tell it hits DVD or VHS.

 YOu know The old script was right in front of them for over 7 or more years. But they Pissed on it and tossed it in the trash. The comics were right there as well. It was all right there in front of them ahead of time, no excuses. They also could of went to the fans to see what they wanted to see in the film.

But noooo.............

For any of you that havn't seen the film don't bother to see it. Dont spend your money on these dvds thats being released, of this film. Just wait for the ""Directors cut"" or the ""Super directors cut"" LOL....

These types of films ""Aliens & Predator"" were not supposed to be watered down famliy movies. This film was focused on mainly just on the money, your hard earned money. They don't care about the scrpit or how the final film turns out anymore.

Don't the people at Fox know that the alien trilogy (alien ressurection does not count) and both predator films were rated R were all great films. I guess the only thing that matters in Hollywood is the big fat $. Which they made alot of by stabbing me and all the other alien and Predator fans.

Another thing what is with that stupid story that made absolutely no sense, even the first Predator movie made sense but. Also the aliens aren't the dumb beasts that they are in this movie the aliens in the alien trilogy were smart just watch Aliens when they cut the power to a building before attacking it. The predators aren't immune to this problem just look where they set the film, it was firlmy established in both predator movies that they only come when it is hot. To me anyways it seems that Paul W.S. Anderson skimmed over the entire 5 films with a fast forward button, idiot.

The only good thing, if you could call it that, is that the aliens and predators look cool but because they are half-assed versions of themselves so I give this ""film"" 1/2 half a point for each monster. PG-13 it still kills me.",1125619200,3,1192,4.3408071748878925
1564800,4,B00005JMZK,"Basic Plot: A group of researchers head into the icy ruins of Antarctica to explore an ancient pyramid. As it turns out, the pyramid was used for battles between worshipped gods and their prey (predators and aliens, of course). And, to the misfortune of the crew, the time has come once again for the creatures to battle, and they find themselves trapped within the giant pyramid right in the middle of the slaughter.

So what if they screwed over the storylines of both the aliens and the predators? As a friend of mine said, AVP is meant to stand alone as a completely new concept for the two species. For people (like myself) that loved both Predator movies and the Alien series, combining the two extraterrestrials in the same movie -- and even more, to have them face-off -- is a dream concept. And, just as the video games and comic books, I believe AVP the movie has succeeded in giving fans (mostly) what they want. The human characters having no appeal whatsoever (unlike Sigourney Weavor or Arnold Schwarzenegger of the original films) just makes it easier to focus on the battles, and at times hoping those idiotic Earthlings will be slaughtered along with the others.

But be warned, the director's cut is soon to be released on DVD with all of the cut footage, including great fight sequences and plenty of gore (giving it an R-rating, mind you, unlike the PG-13 theatrical version). Sadly, though, there aren't any of those R-rated scenes in the deleted scenes featured here. And, to my disappointment, the ""alternate beginning"" was no more than the extremely short scene when the early 1900's Antarctic village was ambushed by a predator (this occurance was mentioned as a historical fact by the characters in the theatrical version, but the ""alternate beginning"" just lets us see it).

Regardless of any disappointments (namely some bad actors, a big difference in the story behind the predators' and aliens' original movies, and some cheesy aspects that take away any terror that could have been in there), AVP is irresistible to any fan of sci-fi/action movies. This is two of cinema's greatest monsters in hand-to-hand combat. What more can you ask for? Don't expect a masterpiece, just expect a good ol' action flick worthy of it's place in your DVD collection (that is unless, like myself, you can't find the patience to wait for the director's cut).",1125360000,2,2371,4.849382716049383

This whole franchise won't quit until its eaten itself through and through... ACid blood comes to mind.

Seriously, the whole concept (as pointed out by the spotlight review) is flawed. It begins by wasting a whole 15 minutes, concerning the matter of 'its not safe to go out there without training'. Eventually the tour guide chick agrees and bang....TIME LAPSES... everyone arrives at the destination ok... what was the point of all that...

It takes a fairly long time for all the action to begin. And when it does, it proceeds like a Tomb Raider sequence, feeling like a video game... as does most of the directors work. His error... he  has no ability to establish characters in a movie. People die just as quickly as they are introduced. GAME OVER.

The movie doesnt bother with accuracies... predator is a predator and alien is an alien. Thats about all there is from past stories.

1564806,3,B00005JMZK,"I recently watched this movie with a friend of mine and being an Alien and Predator fan, I expected some killer conflicts and terrifying scenes. However, the director of this movie has made some fatal errors and what could've been the ultimate Predator and Alien Clash is rather mediocre, hence the 3 star rating. Since I've watched every Alien and Predator Movie, read a few books and played the games, allow me to offer you my insight...

The first thing I immediately noticed were the changes to the Predator. The Director has abandoned the raw, pragmatic culture of the predators for a more sleek, smooth look. Now we all know Preds are, as Ah-nie once said, ""ugly motherf*****s."" And they are, so do you really think the preds care how they look? Hell no! I was quite disappointed by this and instead of dirter, slimier and more, shall we say ""crude,"" Predators that appear in earlier movies, we are given fashion-conscious Monsters. The next thing that I also noticed (as another reviewer noted, and kudos to him/her) that there were more aliens than hosts and the time span for the Alien's life cycle was just magically decreased! And according to this other insightful reviewer, the Director CUT OUT most scenes that would explain these anomolies and the best fight scenes so it was more ""audience friendly."" Wuss! I could go on about these many mistakes, but it would be fruitless as this other reviewer has pointed out all mistakes in the movie.

The storyline isn't too bad. A heat spike in the Arctic lures a group of Human Explorers from the Weyland Company to the North Pole, while a group of Predators also make their way to the frigid wasteland. Consequently the explorers discover a huge Temple that is the source of all Major Civilizations and also discover another race that apparently taught humans how to develop their society (i.e Predators). Of course, this Temple is also home to Alien Facehuggers and one mean-ass Queen, and of course most of the idiotic explorers are turned to lifeless Alien Hosts. The survivors get caught in the conflict between Aliens and Predators and must find a way to escape before they're impaled, spiked, melted, turned into hosts or human goo. I reckon the storyline is pretty good and does offer a greater insight into the Predator and Alien Races alike, so I'll give it 8/10 for effort.

The acting is mediocre to good, and the animitronic faces sometimes appear a little plastic. There's not enough fighting between Aliens and Predators, and the ending is predictable, and right at the end it's kinda lame. So in terms of reviving the franchise and offering gruelling realism and violence, this movie fails miserably! Hopefully a Director out there will produce another movie that's more violent, organised and gripping.

The only reason I say that this movie is mediocre is because it provides more information on the Aliens and Predators and it's fun to see stupid humans get the crap kicked out of them, nearly literally. So overall ""Aliens Vs. Predator,"" gets 3/5 or 6/10, whatever you prefer. Perhaps it would just be better to just rent the movie or wait for it to come on T.V. Tape it if you want! For real Die-Hard Fans only and those who like light violence and PG13 Action. Peace Out!",1123977600,,3251,4.779359430604982

And don't say that they could make more off of viewings with a more family friendly rating. The same thing happened to another sci-fi series, Robocop.

Ripley, Arnold, and Danny Glover were all characters with on screen presence, charisma, and personality. The characters in AvP all have the personality of a cardboard box. There are no characters worth rooting for or caring for.

And whats with the laughable, though not on purpose , parts?

I can just picture a Predator and a human clinging to a rocket sled down a tube. Sure...

Or a Predator marking a female with a battle scar and handing her a Alien tail and head as a trophy. Yup...

And who let Barry Bonds and Mark Mcguire into the Predator locker rooms? The Predators have been taking steroids and should be banned from hunting for 3 months for illegal drug use!

He did play a android in Aliens and a human version in Alien 3. I think he is a descendant of the human version of Bishop. He has a great line in this movie when he fights a predator. Paul W.S. Anderson (director of Resident Evil and Event Horizon) wrote and directed this film. This isn't suppose to be a sequel to either film series.

1564900,1,B00005JMZK,"I am an Alien and Predator fan, I have Alien Quadrilogy and Predator/Predator2 special edition, so imagine how much I love those creatures. Besides, I played Aliens vs. Predator PC games since 90's.

I expected a kick a** move because there are a lot of history and links between both creatures, remebered the final scene where Danny Glover entered to the Predator spaceship and see an Alien skull?

Well, this movie really stinks becuase the lack of continuity with the creatures story.

Predator side;

1.- the came to the earth to hunt men, so why they became gods to ancient people a long time ago.

2.- in this movie the investigators deducted that every 100 years the predator came to earth for an iniciation, so why Terminator and Danny Glover fight them in a short period or time?

And I can continue writting but I don't have the time

Alien side;

1.- for predators they are like rabbits to hunt, so for the alien fans this is not believable, I mean, what about the beast in Alien and Aliens movies, they are smart and wild

2.- time between facebuggers, chestbruster and the beast itself, in alien a movie quarter is about the facebugger investigation, they tried to remove it from John Hurt's face, then after a long time appeard the chestbruster in a very nasty way, and in this movie only seconds is the time between every phase. and so on.

1564901,4,B00005JMZK,"I read the mixed reviews and decided to find out for myself if Alien vs Predator was trash or treasure....the verdict: it is excellent....very entertaining.

If excess gore was cut, as is claimed by some critics, the absence is not evident nor does it detract in any way from the movie. I liked the characters, especially the female lead (Sanaa Lathan) who is tough as nails yet easy on the eyes, in true Ripley tradition. She forms an unusual alliance during the movie, which I think you will find most entertaining.

The premise is downright great science fiction: an ancient Mayan-style pyramid is discovered deep beneath the Antarctic ice. It is the staging area for periodic sporting battles between Aliens (specially bred within the pyramid), and visiting bands of Predators. The human explorers are lured there merely to serve as incubators for the new crop of Alien creatures (by way of particularly nasty, leaping, spidery face-huggers).

This movie highlights the differences between the Alien creatures, which are basically reptilian animals that are sly, capable hunters functioning primarily on instinct, and the Predators which are more humanoid, with much greater intellect (than us too, after all they have the ability to build and pilot advanced space craft).

Combine this great premise with elaborate, convincing sets; good script and acting; superb special effects; excellent cinematography, and some clever new story ideas...and you have the recipe for a great SciFi movie.

I almost feel like I deserve some kind of medal for watching the whole thing.

Regardless as to who did what in the war of the Director vs Producers, the plot has no legs and the writers should be banned from working in film again. At least then we could say that some good came of this movie.",1123372800,,684,3.9565217391304346

A lot of people are wanting to see this (or already have) because it's supposed to be a big action movie. It's not. The action starts late, lags, and ends quick. Honestly: People do not mind watching long (i.e. Lord of the Rings) movies if the story is good, or at least has some king of redeeming values. Unfortunatly, this film has neither.

To Alien fans: You will be angry. The chest-bursters come out in five minutes (give or take a few seconds). Also, the aliens have more of a ""Alien: Resurrection"" look instead of an ""Aliens"" look to them.

To Predator fans: You will be angry. The predators look bulky football players, not tall, peak-condition humanoids. They are written as chumps, who get taken out in no time (Seriously. ONE alien killed two predators within 10 minutes of each other). Aren't predators supposed to be the ultimate in hunters.

Now, if you want to see this movie, go ahead. Most people who want to in the first place won't be stopped by any bad publicity. Just know this: it's not perfect in the least. The fight scenes are sloppily shot, the lighting is bad (it's not like in the ""Alien"" movies where it's supposed to be creepy, it's just bad), the creatures don't look as good as their predecesors, and the humans cannot act to save their lives.

So guess what will come down the road 6 months to a year from now?  AVP-Director's Cut (THANKFULLY).  I will wait to buy until then.

Movie makers are going to have to learn that the under 16 crowd is the movie goers these days.  Movie theatres are used as a ""babysitter"".  But you CANNOT gear all movies to that audience and have to make choices that stop this dumbing-down of movies.  Why there are so many box office failures of late.

What if they had hired competent authors or script writers who had actually seen the prior movies.  What if the scripot had some minor yet important changes that would have endeared the movie to us.  For example, instead of the present why not set this in the future (where the Alien franchise has always taken place)?  The carrot could be our historians have found a key to translating an alien text (Predator writings) that describe an ancient location holding a great and massive weapon.  Now we send in a team made up of corporate peaople, historians and marines.  They go to the ancient location on some unknown world and the rest of the movie is the same.  Now this does not cure all the defects in the movie and the film would still probably rate no better than three stars, however, I have improved the movie by two whole stars in five minutes.

1565019,1,B00005JMZK,"Let's be honest here, anyone who had expectations of this being good had those expectations set way too high. Myself, I waited 10 years.

I know the reports of Anderson whining about the studio dictating the cut of his movie. How great it 'could have been but for those guys.' Unfortunately, Paul Anderson is a hack. He hasn't made a good movie, ever. Are all of them the fault of the studio? Good director's take responsiblity for what they release. Sure good directors have put out crap from time to time, Steven Spielbereg made A.I., for pity's sake. At least they admit their failures.

It's not as if this wasn't a diamond idea, either. And it's not like there wasn't a perfect script, all ready storyboarded and ready to go. Look at the very first Alien vs Predator graphic novel from 1994, Prey. Ready made perfection. It was all there and ready to go. From the commentaries on the DVD it's obvious that Dark Horse (the publisher) was fully in bed on this one. And it isn't that the writer didn't know the comic because it is borrowed from repeatedly, albeit, in watered down form.
And yet instead of a compelling action adventure we get a Paul Anderson vision of mediocrity.

I find it sad when a game or in this case a comic can have more life to it's characters than real people on a screen. For further proof just look at the hatchet job Anderson did on Resident Evil.
More than any medium the graphic novel is tailor made to be transferred to the screen. It's scripted, it's storyboarded. Just fill in actors and film. For proof of this look at how incredible Sin City turned out. Of course, in that case Frank Miller was holding the reins tight.

So there could be a Director's Cut.
So what? Whatever was removed would just be more of the same hackneyed tripe.

So there could be a sequel.
Why bother? This horse is dead and unless someone can resurrect it the way the corpse of cinema Batman was revived with Batman Begins, no one should try.

Paul Anderson makes movies that start off incredibly well. Every time I see a Paul W. S. Anderson movie, I watch the first twenty minutes and think ""Hey, this might actually be good!"" He raises expectations, gets you excited, pulls out all of his best tricks... and then somewhere around 30 minutes in, it turns to garbage. If you think about it, all of his movies from Event Horizon to Resident Evil suffer from this malady. AVP is no exception.

In the opening scene, I watched an incredibly stylized alien-like silhouette turn into a satellite. And then it cut to a high tech lab, and then out to the desert, and then out to some glacier. As Paul Anderson assembled his team of protagonists, the movie had a distinct ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""Jurassic Park"" vibe. In fact, now that I think about it, it had all the trappings of a Spielberg movie. The cherry on top of the sundae was when the wealthy tycoon Weyland, who was organizing the search party, turned out to be the actor who played ""Bishop"" in Aliens. I was on for the ride. I gripped my popcorn, I buckled in. I thought Paul Anderson had finally come into his own as a filmmaker... and he couldn't have picked a better time. Here was the unification of two of my favorite Science Fiction/Horror characters. If ever Paul Anderson was going to step up and be a real director, the time was now. I smiled, I squeezed my date's hand. This was gonna be great...

And then, it started to suck. Gradually at first, almost as if Anderson was thinking that if he just gave us a great opening we might forget about the fact that the rest of the movie was terrible. I figured things were going badly when the heroes enter a pyramid that they've found thousands (millions?) of feet beneath an arctic whaling station. Hokey, yes... but I'm still buying it. And then, our heroes venture inside this ancient edifice and are trapped inside the pyramid because they decided to take some Predator guns. You'd think these people never saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. I kept waiting for someone to bust out a bull whip. The only thing that was missing was the flying darts and the big boulder.

At this point in the movie, I got a really vivid mental picture of Paul Anderson standing in his living room, with DVD copies of Alien, Predator, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Cube laid out on the floor, and he's standing there taking a leak on all of them and laughing maniacally. I'm not kidding. That image flashed through my head.

Anyway, so when I finally shook myself out of it, there were people that were getting attacked by face-huggers that were bullet-timed a la the Matrix (and every other action movie since). I mentally added The Matrix to the DVDs on Paul's floor, covered with urine. These same people give birth to aliens a mere five minutes later. Suddenly the gestation period for aliens shortened by like three days. I think that might have made me angrier than anything. I just wanted to drive to Paul Anderson's house in the middle of the night, grab him and say, ""There are rules to think about here, Paul. Not a lot of them, but you do need to respect the movies that came before. I understand that it makes your job a little tougher because you want to tell a story about an alien, and you need to have it bust out of somebody's chest pretty early in the story... but you're getting paid a lot of money to figure out a clever way of making it work.""

But even so, I kept watching. I had come this far, I needed to see the title bout. I watched clunky Predators with ridiculous dreadlocks fight with equally clumsy Aliens. All I could think was, ""Gee, I bet it's hot inside those suits."" You could practically smell the latex. Still, there are some fun moments, so I keep watching.

And then the protagonist becomes best friends with a Predator and they go off to hunt Aliens together like Butch and Sundance. All of this comes at great expense as you are forced to watch our heroine playing a goofy game of charades with the Predator. When Predators start acting, you know you're in trouble. The end fight scene with the Alien Queen Mum is pretty good. I actually started to enjoy myself again in the last ten minutes of the movie. And then I remembered that I felt the same way about Resident Evil. That last shot with Milla in the city was great. It made me rethink my P.W.S. Anderson theory. Maybe he makes movies that begin and end really well, and then fills them with processed meat. If I ever choose to see another one of his movies, I'm going to walk out after twenty minutes, go get something to eat, and then come back for the last ten and see how I feel about it.",1120953600,4,4680,4.428571428571429
1565022,5,B00005JMZK,"Now, really, you people have got to lighten up.  One thing I do have to thank you for:  My expectations for this film were so low that I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought I'd have trouble sitting through it, instead ended up watching it as a rental three times in a row, and then ordering my own copy.  So, herewith allow me to try to counter the many negative reviews you're going to find, on Amazon and elsewhere.

First, I've never read an Alien vs Predator comic book, and didn't much care for any of the movies except Alien 1 and 2.  To me, Alien 3 and 4 were pretentious and hugely disappointing, and I thought the Predator films, while fun, were standard monster/action fare.  And I recognize some of AVP's shortcomings:  Dark sets that make some of the action hard to follow, and characters that are perhaps a little comic-booky and two-dimensional.  However....

To really grasp what's good about AVP (and understand some of the action), you need to watch the bonus materials, plus the two audio commentaries -- the first with the director and the two main stars, Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen; the second, with three of the people responsible for the special effects, including Tom Woodruff, who was inside an Alien suit much of the time.

At any rate, here's my inventory of what's great about this film:

* First and foremost, excellent, excellent, excellent special effects, due to the willingness to blend older and newer technology as appropriate:  from props, to puppets, marionettes, actors in monster suits, to amazing full-size sets, elaborate miniatures, green-screen overlays, to animatronics, all the way to CGI, with a heavy emphasis on ""practical"" shots wherever possible, as opposed to computer graphics.  The look and feel of the film are wonderful.  I was surprised to hear that this was a relatively low-budget project (shot in Prague to save money); I'd never have guessed funds were tight.  A film like this makes more modernistic, CGI-dominated fare such as ""I, Robot"" look cartoonish.

* It's a creature feature!  If the earlier efforts left you drooling (pun intended) for more Alien or Predator footage, this is for you.  There's some of the less-is-more, jaws-type suspense buildup, especially at first, but unlike its predecessors where you hardly ever get to see the monsters, this movie has got 'em.  This is one you can really sink your teeth into, so to speak.

* A very good cast.  Not quite at the level of Alien 1 (how many films are?), but competent and effective.  Seeing Lance Henriksen, of course, is like a reunion with an old friend.  Sanaa Lathan is not Sigourney Weaver, doesn't capture the same feeling of horror and desperation Weaver added to Alien 1 and 2, but she isn't meant to.  Instead, she does a good job as a brave, indomitable comic-book heroine stereotype, ultimately winning the mark of a warrior from the Predator she's forced to ally with.  (""The enemy of my enemy is my friend."")

* A story line that holds together very well, and makes this about as perfect a prequel as you could hope for.  Some of the other reviews complained about illogical, hard-to-swallow plot points.  Maybe I'm just dense, but it seemed very well thought out to me.  I thought the references to Chariots of the Gods fit in perfectly.  On the whole, in a genre that tends to take a lot of liberties with scientific accuracy and common sense, there's not much to complain about with this one.  (Sure, having a bottomless undersea trench a few yards away from a pyramid buried 2 kilometers underground is a bit of a goof, but how else are you going to watch the Alien queen disappear into a seemingly limitless void at the end?  Were you planning to put an airlock on the coast of Antarctica?  Think before you make these suggestions.)

* Clever tributes, tie-ins and references to the earlier films.  Example:  Henriksen, the aging billionaire CEO, sitting at his desk, pensively tapping a pencil between his outstretched fingers, recalling the finger-fillet scene in Aliens.

* This film is not afraid to have a little fun, though it does it in a very relaxed and unforced way, with some respect for the viewer's intelligence, not hamming it up.  For example, in the first commentary you find out they cut the line, ""You mean they're just teenagers?!?"" because Anderson felt it would detract from the intensity of the scene.  Personally, had I been directing, I wouldn't have been that strong.

If you're wavering on this one, I hope my comments have been some help.  If you have any affection at all for aliens and/or predators, I encourage you to at least rent it.  As for me, I'm hoping for a sequel to the prequel.",1120435200,4,4667,4.7596513075965134
1565023,1,B00005JMZK,"Paul W.S. Anderson continually makes stupid movies, and I expected no different here.

I don't mind the mindless action. I don't even mind the fact that a 12-year-old probably wrote the script. It annoys me that we have directors who are filling hollywood jobs that so many talented people could be utilizing. Paul almost seems oblivious to the fact that his movies are mindless. I hate this movie because you can't even enjoy the mindless fun.

Here is the honest truth though. I came out of that movie and couldn't remember the main character's name. I honestly tried hard to remember it, but nothing came to my mind. That must tell you something.",1120262400,,649,4.734513274336283
1565024,4,B00005JMZK,"I have been a huge Alien fan since the first one came out.  I collect a lot of the alien figures from mcfarlane and palisades as well.  I was very excited about the release of this movie even though I am not a huge fan of the predator franchise.  I didn't see this movie in the theater but I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.

The movie is rushed, that is for sure.  Although it has it's moments of originality as well.  I can definitely tell some of the scenes were direct homage to the earlier Alien movies.  I think the movie had a lot of potential and once again Hollywood missed it's mark.  Audiences should be given more credit for wanting solid story lines and Hollywood shouldn't bank on people flocking to see movies like this because of past successes and ever increasing improvements on special effects.

Nothing will ever meet the suspense and horror of the original Alien or the action and adrenaline pumping intensity of Aliens.  I am a big fan of the 3rd and 4th installments as well but neither of those meet the classic status of Alien 1 and 2.  I give this movie 4 stars because I feel like the actors gave it their best shot with what and who they had to work with as a Director.  I also gave it 4 stars because the sound and picture quality are both excellent.  4 stars were given again because the Aliens and Predators were actual actors and or animatronics (with some CGI thrown in for good measure, I do commend the studios for at least reverting back to these techniques and not relying on computers to provide all the special effects).

Overall I am still happy with the movie but not as happy as I wished I was going to be.  My only hope now is the Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver will step up to the plate one more time and give this franchise the final send off that it truly deserves with Alien 5.  My fingers are crossed.",1118793600,2,1860,4.271428571428571
1565025,2,B00005JMZK,"Way back when, a short story appeared in the pages of Dark Horse Presents that made a link between the creatures from the movies Alien and Predator.  Readers wanted more.  Many stories, comics and books later the match up finally made it to the big screen.  Unfortunately it did not have the lure and fascination of its lineage.

Satellite imagery uncovers a buried pyramid in Antarctica near an abandoned whaling station.  A team is sent to check it out.  Apparently a team from space is also arriving to check it out.  The pyramid has characteristics of several ancient civilizations.  The features are all on the outside for inside the pyramid has more open space than any pyramid should.  This is a hunting preserve.  Every one hundred years alien hunters arrive to battle horrible serpents.  The archeological team accidentally sets things in motion a little too early.  An alien queen is revived, eggs are laid and the game begins.  From there the movie becomes straight action with little suspense until the ending.

The Alien movies all take place in the future.  The Predator movies are contemporary.  This movie is contemporary.  Predator movies were action oriented while Alien gained fame through suspense.  This movie is action oriented.  By the end I wasn't sure why this film had been made.  While an Aliens vs Predator movie is a good idea this one seemed to bring in the wrong elements, or at least not the right ones.  Some scenes from the trailers are actually not part of the main movie, but part of a ""history lesson"" provided so the viewer has some idea what is going on.  I was also taken aback by how easily the pyramid was damaged.  Every fight crushed huge amounts of stone yet the pyramid had been intact after seemingly being used for millennia.  Definitely a disappointment.",1118707200,,1803,4.798045602605863

1565097,2,B00005JMZK,"As you get older, you learn that some things are worth waiting for.

Then there's Alien Vs. Predator, a belated hybrid sequel that attempts to revive two flagging franchises. It fails. It's disheartening after two Predator and four Alien films, plus numerous comic books, it all comes down to this, a flaming bag of dog poop that smells worse every time director Paul W.S. Anderson steps on it.

More than twenty years of moon dust has settled on the two franchises. Predator booked its last vacation in 1990, while the face-huggers of Alien: Resurrection last gestated in1997. If anyone thinks Alien Vs. Predator is happenstance, look back at the final scenes of Predator 2, when Danny Glover's New York cop lays witness to a Predator trophy case. Among the souvenirs is an Alien skull. Funny joke at the time, not so funny when you realize what Anderson has done with it.

Instead of delivering a full-throttle, no-holds-barred grudge match between two of the universe's most deadly killing machines, Anderson slops up a generic monster mash completely devoid of suspense, thrills, logic, and most important, genuine horror. As a director who cut his teeth on hard-R science-fiction and horror films (Resident Evil, Event Horizon), Alien Vs. Predator feels like an abbreviated vision.

What distinguished the Alien and Predator films from their B-movie predecessors were their unrelenting creatures and vicious, sadistic violence that propelled the audience into visceral mind- trip. Aside from that kid in school who ate a bad cafeteria burrito, up until Alien no one had seen what happens when a parasitic creature bursts through your chest. The original Predator upped the ante, manufacturing new and interesting ways to dissect a human.

So why, after years of waiting with baited breath, do we get this watered-down Alien Vs. Predator, a film made and rated for 14-year-old boys who will probably find most of this insulting and silly. Why make and market a film to people who weren't even DNA when the originals were released, and who have since seen them uncut on cable or DVD? Who exactly are they protecting?

Teenagers, who always seem to find a way into R-rated movies? Investors, who believe making a PG-13 film gives them more bang for their buck? Or fans, who will undoubtedly feel betrayed and dismayed that what was once defining and cutting-edge has become nothing more than artifice? Anderson's plot has promise, but it's a promise he can't keep.

While scanning the globe for new mineral deposits, billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) is intrigued when his satellite uncovers a hot spot underneath Antarctica. Further investigation unveils a pyramid buried deep under the ice. After quickly assembling a crackerjack team of scientists, adventurers, and security personnel, Weyland (whose ties to the Alien franchise are well known) descends into the pyramid.

Team leader Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan) and chief archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bava) realize that they have literally stepped back in time, when aliens taught humans how to build pyramids (presumably by watching Stargate). De Rosa can literally read the writing on the wall (what rugged, handsome archaeologist worth his Ultra-Brite smile couldn't?), and the news isn't good. They have stumbled upon a Predator training camp, where a captive Queen Alien is being forced to breed eggs and offspring as prey.

Filled with constantly changing chambers and revolving rooms, the team members become separated, forcing them to go one-one-one with their non-human hosts. Talk about having a bad day. If aliens aren't hugging your face and bursting through your chest (a process expedited for time), they're turning you into Hamburger Helper. Which would be fine if the action were on the screen and not relegated to reaction shots.

The naivet that greeted Alien and Predator is sadly missing here. Characters do and say the dumbest things. Anderson tries to replicate the dynamic of Alien by putting a woman in charge, which feels like an act of desperation rather than an homage. Sanaa Lathan is tough, but she's no Ripley.

She's like Lara Croft without the smarmy smirk. Bava carries the lead weight of the script on his broad shoulders, the voice of reason forced to utter extremely unreasonable dialogue. The performers in the rubber alien suits are lucky. They don't have to keep a straight face.

Like the little quirky Canadian thriller The Cube, the remainder of the film finds our reluctant heroes trying to escape the maze before becoming toast. Oddly, we're rooting for the Predators.",1117584000,,4610,5.148395721925134
1565098,2,B00005JMZK,"When I saw the trailer for this, it really looked great. But when watching it you watch a bunch of humans find a place buried 100's of feet below ground and end up stuck in there as a war between the Aliens and the Predators begins. But the stupid thing is, the first half is setting up the charactors, then the next half they have been killed off before you've blinked and it's just focused on one person, one Predator and there partnership. (They may as well have given her and the Alien a love scene to put the nail in the coffin)

There was too much charactor development to just off everybody suddenly and focus on the warriors from another world. The ending was completly predicted and it revealed nothing memorable or worth remembering.

1565103,4,B00005JMZK,"While most critics have dripped acid on Paul Anderson's ""Alien vs. Predator,"" apparently due to prima facie objections to the very idea of a non-courtroom-drama with the word ""versus"" in the title, I was pleasantly surprised by AVP.

Is AVP as great as 1986's ""Aliens""?  Nope.  But I think comparing AVP to ""Aliens"" is to employ the wrong standard.  AVP is not competing with that film, in much the same way that ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" was not competing with the sensational ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.""  No, ""Star Trek VI"" was competing with the largely reviled ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.""  Similarly, AVP is really competing with the oppressively dark, fundamentally unappealing ""Alien 3"" and strangely goofy, utterly unexciting ""Alien Resurrection""; the last Predator movie, 1990's ""Predator 2,"" was released so long ago and did such middling box office that it hardly figures in the popular imagination anymore.

Some have complained about AVP's characters, arguing that they're mere sketches compared to the colorful, indelible personalities that James Cameron provided us in ""Aliens,"" and John McTiernan gave us in ""Predator.""  While true, it's worth pointing out that the original ""Alien"" ""suffers"" from the same ""problem,"" so much so that a defensive Ridley Scott once said, ""The characters in 'Alien' are as defined as they need to be, no more and no less.""  Just as the characters in ""Alien"" were largely, nay, archetypically defined by their professions and their professionalism (or lack thereof), the characters in AVP are defined by their jobs and the proficiency with which they do them.

Some have also complained that many of AVP's characters are dispatched too quickly.  However, that's part of what makes AVP interesting.  It's a real throwback to horror films of yesteryear, films that weren't afraid to toss virtually everyone to the wolves.  Just when you begin to think, ""Oh, Anderson's spent too much time developing this character, giving him/her good lines and telling us stuff about his/her past, to just off him/her,"" that person buys it.  It's delightfully perverse, and it's what the horror genre has historically been all about.

Then there are the complaints about the film's storyline, with some asserting that it's too simple (e.g. humans find buried pyramid; humans enter buried pyramid; sh*t hits fan) and others arguing that it overshoots the mark (e.g. humans enter buried pyramid and discover that it's remarkably complex, revealing all manner of information about the origins of human civilizations, namely that the titular Predators, much like the Monolith from ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" made a marked impact on the future course of homo sapiens long ago).  But I had few problems with the film's premise.  Even the rather silly, pulpy quality of AVP's grander narrative conceits didn't bother me that much.  (Then again, such conceits didn't really bother me in ""Stargate"" either.)  And the simpler aspects of AVP's plot were its strongest suits, for they grounded the movie in a kind of gritty, easily understood ""reality,"" the kind of reality that was very effective in John Carpenter's better actioners, from ""Assault on Precinct 13"" to ""Escape from New York.""

Yes, it's true that AVP never achieves the epic heights of ""Aliens,"" the best film from either franchise, a film so complex and dynamic that it required a running time of 137 minutes to tell its tale.  But ""Aliens"" was, and remains, an exceedingly special film.  ""Aliens"" is the like the filmic equivalent of one of those outsized rock songs from the 1970s, such as Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven""; AVP, at approximately 100 minutes in length, is more like a Ramones tune: short but sweet.

In fact, two of AVP's biggest problems seem to be the result of breakneck-speed sloppiness: 1. the Alien lifecycle is inexplicably abbreviated, with chestbursters making their nasty debuts in tens of minutes rather than tens of hours; 2. the Predators' long-range weapons (e.g. spears and throwing stars) are acid-resistant, yet their close-quarters materiel (e.g. wrist blades and body armor) are not.

Regarding Issue One: I've read that Anderson accounted for this in the film, explaining that the Predators had injected bizarre hormones into the Alien Queen they'd captured to seed their battlegrounds, causing the eggs she produced to contain embryos that matured far more quickly than usual.  This expository material was allegedly ordered cut by Fox because they felt it needlessly slowed the pacing of the film.  If true, Anderson must be given a pass by the legions of angry fanboys who've ripped him a new one over this.

Regarding Issue Two: According to fanboys familiar with the AVP comic books, this is explained therein thusly: the Predators must earn every acid-resistant armament they receive.  So if the Preds in the AVP movie didn't have acid-resistant wrist blades or body armor, that's on them.  But it's also on Anderson to have somehow explained this in his film.  However, I'm willing to let Anderson slide here, as the best characters in AVP to have provided this explanation were the Preds themselves, a decidedly taciturn group of individuals.

All in all, AVP did its job.  With the exception of a handful of (de rigueur) overly-jittery/super-slow shutter-speed shots in otherwise well-made action sequences, AVP is a polished piece of work.  Thanks to Anderson's direction, the ADI FX Workshop was forced to abandon the Mr. Hanky-looking design of the creature from ""Alien 3,"" as well as the beastly, overly slimy appearance of the extraterrestrials from ""Alien Resurrection,"" and provide the silver screen with its best looking xenomorphs since 1986.  Moreover, if you can't bring yourself to buy it when Sanaa Lathan's Lex throws in with and throws down alongside the last-standing Big Ugly Motherf*cker, nor get certifiably juiced when the Alien Queen finally extricates herself from Predator-imposed bondage and goes on an angry rampage worthy of a T-Rex in a ""Jurassic Park"" movie, then I'm afraid AVP simply isn't for you.",1116720000,37,6089,5.154471544715447

Let's just say that I would have prefered to have arnold team up with an alien. As unreal the plot is, having a lady kicking alien's butt is not believable at all. So, this was tried approach, ahem terminator 3, has failed again in my opinion. There were a lot of holes in the plot too. For example, in the very end when the predators fail to see the fact that one of their was infected. How did the Queen Survive? So you know, this is not exactly the type of movie that you could sit down and admire for years. Good Fun Movie though, and it's well worth it's, ahem used, price.

1565180,2,B00005JMZK,"What can one say about a film based on a comic book franchise? One hardly expects high drama, an insight into society or a considered view of the world. What one expects is some reasonable form of escapist entertainment. This is probably not such a bad thing as some of the better films can hardly be seen to have been made with ponderous seriousness. Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, Casabalanca are effective films but in the intellectual stakes they hover around the Mills and Boon romance thriller level.

One of the surprising things with this film are that the director appears somewhat brighter than for instance the film makers of the European Dogma movement who get a superior press. (I note however that among the fans of the genre he appears to be not highly regarded.)  The extras provided by the DVD have the director talking about the construction of the characters the development of the plot the attempt to make some logically consistent world in which the events take place. The impression one gets in watching him talk is of a talented and thoughtful craftsman rather than a dullard churning out a hackneyed plot. Still one would expect that as the amount of money riding on a project such as this would be considerable compared to a film made by a Danish film maker using a hand held camera and an improvised plot.

The difficulty is however that if one makes a monster movie how to make it interesting. Part of the attraction of films such as Alien and Predator is that the films reveal the nature of the monster and his world during the course of the film. Surprise and fining out what is going on is part of the enjoyment of the film. By the time that this film is made the types of monsters one is dealing with are well known it becomes difficult to make the plot interesting. Of course Alien, Predator and Aliens had the same plot. A number of characters are put in a position of vulnerability. The role of most of the characters is to die at intervals increasing the tension with eventually one or two of the characters surviving by besting an adversary of supernatural power. Now with Alien, Aliens and Predator we did not know that the plot was going to work out on those lines. However by the time we get to Alien and Predator we have monsters whose characteristics are well known and we have some humans who we know will end up as cannon fodder with maybe one or two being destined to survive. It is hard to watch a film of this type when you can predict the drift and the main interest is to figure out who will be the Arnie or Sigourney character.

In this film there is an attempt to vary the mix by making one of the predators a character. In fact they are like humans in that they use tools, computers and have a verbal culture. The aliens can act as a group, open doors and so forth but they play the role of Hemingway like big game to be hunted by the predators.

The filmmakers try to give the film some overall logic by suggesting an Eric Van Daniken theory for the development of human society. Interstellar visitors have given man certain skills so that they can use Earth as a sort of game reserve or training base.

The film sort of works if you try hard to lock out the various plot absurdities. The human characters act irrationally and stupidly in such a way as to make themselves vulnerable to both the alien species. Even in doing something like climbing a mountain or exploring subterranean caves real people take more precautions than this lot does. However the characters in this film not only discover a vast subterranean feature that emits huge amounts of energy but a gigantic tunnel is drilled mysteriously.  One would think that this might lead to some radio messages home or a bit of discussion about how to proceed. Not in science fiction movie land.",1114473600,2,3805,4.505797101449275
1565181,3,B00005JMZK,"This movie is not as good as the original Alien or Predator but it is entertaining from start to finish nevertheless. A large corporation detects a pyramid under 2,000 feet of ice in Antarctica and assembles a team to explore it.

The company is headed up by a mega millionaire, played by the same actor who was the android in the first two Alien movies. The star of the team is a mountain climber who is an expert in climbing ice walls. She is joined by a bunch of experts including an archeologist whose biggest prize seems to have been a Pepsi bottle cap found at one of his digs and another one who seems to only be interested in taking digital pictures.

When the group arrives at the site they discover a hole has already been mysteriously burned into the ice all the way down to the pyramid. Rather than take time to assess the situation they head with reckless abandon down the hole to the pyramid.

The pyramid seems to be a combination of Egyptian, Aztec, and Asian culture. Also, there are carvings of Predators and Aliens and a warning that only those who are ""worthy"" may enter. The pyramid has other surprises such as moving walls that cause the pyramid to rearrange itself every 10 minutes so its tunnel system is always different.

As everyone knows that has seen the trailer, the pyramid is a training ground for Predator's to hone their skills by battling Aliens. Of course the humans start getting wiped out, first by invisible Predators and then by Aliens that want to drag them back to the Alien nest to implant Alien hosts in their bodies.

The movie seems to waste no time in introduction and we seem to get to the action immediately. If you can ignore some of the downsides such as why the Predators don't use their invisibility against the Aliens, why the people are in the frigid Antarctica but have no visible breath, why they seem to be outside in the frigid cold sometimes without a jacket and not be cold, how they can be there with fingerless gloves and not have their fingers freeze, also the movie gives no explanation how whoever survives at the end will get back to civilization considering they are about 1,000 miles away from it.",1114473600,2,2166,4.529411764705882

A couple of brain cells kept ticking whilst watching

1. If predators can fashion an acid proof shield for their human ally why don't they use it for their armour/helms

2. If the preds are going in with the worst wpns why do they have discs which is what most online players think of as the most effective weapon. Whilst thinking about the disc its a disc guys u cant put 6 blades on one side of a disc throwing wpn it unbalances it dur.

3. This training ground has being going for thousands of years once every 100 years and the predators hadnt figured out to put the queen in an alien proof prison? ahem basic intellegence check here.

4. Setting off nuclear explosions in the antarctic, are they quite mad? ice caps melting etc .

apart from these gripes and others its still a cool movie just not seminal.

As a devoted fan whos spent many years as a predator online with avp and avp2 from sierra games,(avp3 plz guys with stealth attack aliens).I have a few suggestions for how to make avp2 great.

ideas for avp2

set in desert pyramids, inside of crashlanded space ship

preds or humans have alien carapace armour

show pred sniping with decapating spear gun.

long range snipers who wait and kill for preds or humans

SAS team that does room clearance, grenade room then move,

have 3 human survivors and put main heroine in intensive care.

show a panic run away human

show a beserker human response

have fewer aliens and make them a bit tougher

runner alien, predalien, drones.

put holes in predators when humans spray rooms with gunfire.

introduce the pred pistol that melts aliens in the games

show a spiderman ninja pred with disc

use online gaming community to get some cool behaviours for aliens preds and marines.

just some thoughts and hopefully see some of you prey out in cyberspace hunting grounds of avp2 or avp3 game.

1565245,3,B00005JMZK,"Our friend Gregory wrote an incredible review about the movie (check it out !). However I would like to reply a couple of his remarks that I believe can be easily explained:

Number 1: Yes, Lance Henriksen played Mr. Weyland perfectly right, though I hate the way he dies in the movie. One thing to have in mind is that Henriksen's character in Alien 3 is actually an android... YES. There is an scene were he is attacked by the last survivor of Fury and he is heavly damaged (one of his ears is left hanging by a thread...) with no red blood involved... check it out !

Number 9: Though it may seem a little odd, in Alien (the first one) one of the characters (the android, I believe) says ""they feed on oxygen""... yes it's weird, but that explains why we haven't seen Aliens eating humans (just killing them or capturing them for breeding purposes).

Number 13: The queen order her warrior aliens to release her because she ""senses"" her eggs are being destroyed by humans... (check the order of the scenes... it gives you that idea).

Number 15: Predators wear masks not only because they're cool, but because it prevents ""face-huggers"" to reach their mouths and throats... (check the scene were the last predator takes off his mask and is immediately attacked by a ""face-hugger""... with success).

Excess of CGI ?... don't think so (just like in Alien Resurrection).

Abscence of character development... Absolutely !

I can only agree with the rest of Gregory's excellent comments (Wow!, he really did his homework).

1565246,3,B00005JMZK,"Alien vs. Predator: (Harald Kloser) Just about every casual movie-goer would probably agree that both the Alien and Predator franchises had already exhausted their welcome and brought themselves to a natural close several years ago. But comic book collectors know better, with a very popular and long-running spin-off comic series pitting the two notorious creatures against each other. It seems as though 20th Century Fox had resisted this concept as a film during the run of the comics, although the profitable pairing of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees in last year's Freddy vs. Jason proved that just about anything is worth a shot (and can make money) these days. Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson's Alien vs. Predator debuted well financially despite a plethora of poor critical and audience reviews (the studio knows what it's doing when it doesn't even provide press screenings). The plot really isn't important in flicks such as this, but for the sake of context, the only thing you really need to know is that there is a secret pyramid under the Antarctic in which those nasty alien creates are bred in captivity so that adolescent predators can be shipped in to Earth to ""come of age"" and prove their battle skills against the aliens. Why it had to be Earth, nobody knows, but it does conveniently explain away the predators' previous involvement on the planet and the existence of some irritating humans as auxiliary characters in this movie. As hard as it is to fathom, the predators are as close to being the good-guys as any party can get, and the musical approach taken for the film by composer Harald Kloser follows the history of the predators' music on the big screen far more than the aliens' music. That said, Kloser's score still doesn't resemble or make strong use of themes from either franchise, instead relying on his own brand of music beefed-up from The Day After Tomorrow and presented as a stand-alone entry in both series.

Starting with the basic musical ingredients of The Day After Tomorrow and beefing them up is a good thing, for that score's weakness was its rather tepid tone and lethargic sense of movement. Whether you accept Alien vs. Predator as a movie premise or not, Kloser has done a more reasonable job with the score than anyone might have expected. Largely orchestral, Kloser combines the same symphonic sound with a chorus and an array of slashing and grinding electronic sound effects. His theme for the film carries over the anthemic qualities from The Day After Tomorrow --after all, this is serious material for comic book collectors!-- and performs it in a similarly slow style with emboldened brass and an enhanced choral presence. It may be tongue in cheek to an extent, but the most enjoyable cues in Alien Vs. Predator are those during which Kloser instills the story with a sense of epic sweep and awe-inspiring realization. The opening and closing titles, along with the ""History of the World"" cue --a great snare-driven moment of bombast-- provide enough interesting harmonic material to make the whole score worthwhile. The entire effort is surprisingly pleasant, with only four or five cues of downright battle music and several cues dedicated to choral-laced melody for moments of discovery and intrigue. Kloser does make an interesting distinction between the predators and aliens in his sound effects: the predator makes a metallic slashing sound for the wrist-worn blades it uses in battle and the alien produces a more extended, swishing and scraping sound that imitates its distinctive cry and whipping tail. With these two effects alternating in the fight cues, Kloser takes much more time to generate a coherent score than was probably necessary. The entire score for Alien vs. Predator produces the same response; the score is nothing spectacular, but it offers far more than was expected given the cheesiness of the film's concept. If at the very least, the project confirms that Kloser is serious about projecting his career in the direction of largely orchestral action efforts, with results so far that may be simplistic and wasted on poor films, but show considerable promise in their intent.-[...] That about sums it up.

1565247,3,B00005JMZK,"The Alien quadrilogy and the Predator movies were really good, and when I saw the trailer for AVP, I was thinking 'oh man. This is going to be one good action-packed movie.' I saw the movie when it came out, and I don't think it was as good of a movie as I had expected, but it wasn't super terrible either.

Pros: The action is really good. There are many special effects, which they also through in to make the action feel real. Also, the soundtrack is good too and makes many of the scenes dramatic.

Cons: Most of the action takes place with the humans, and not between the aliens and predators. The movie is not called AvHvP (alien vs human vs predator). The first battle between the two creatures takes place once more than half of the movie is over, and that battle doesn't even last long.

The only reason I bought this movie was to complete my Alien and Predator movie collections. If you're expecting this movie to be strictly between the Aliens and the Predators, don't buy this movie, because I guarantee, you will be disappointed.",1113696000,,1043,4.478947368421053
1565248,3,B00005JMZK,"After reading some of the reviews here I must admit that most people like to dissect movies finding and listing all flaws major or minor...I'm not going to follow this approach as I think that this way of judging isn't fair.

I had hared many negative comments concerning this movie before seeing it and thus I was expecting something really awful, in the vein of Terminator 3. I have to admit that despite my negative approach AVP really surprised me. Both alien creatures look incredible (more real than in any other movie), the setting is enjoyable and the battle scenes are perfect.

Many reviewers stated that the story was uninspired (Predators coming to earth to fight against Aliens in an ancient pyramid) but I found it interesting and a smart idea that glues the Alien and Predator franchises together. Also the decision to stage the movie in Antarctica really gave the picture a cold, unfriendly and more frightening atmosphere. AVP is rather short in duration (100 minutes) and thus there isn't time to get too familiar with the characters. Nothing looks forced or silly and the story moves on with a normal pace until all hell brakes loose after 40 minutes into the movie. This means that you get more than 40 minutes of battles between Aliens and Predators, which look really amazing, while the humans are being chased down by both species inside the maze of the ancient pyramid.

I can't debate that there are no flaws in the movie, but they don't detract that much from the overall experience. The movie is rated PG-13 thus there isn't much violence in it, but this is not entirely true. There isn't much violence concerning the way that humans are killed, meaning that there isn't a lot of `red' blood. But the movie's name is Alien vs Predator and believe me there is plenty of violence between these guys and a lot of green and acid blood. The other flaw is the cast, don't expect awful performances (like Terminator 3) but not Academy award winning ones either. The final and most important flaw IMO are the friendly bonds created between the Predator and the protagonist, which detract from the whole claustrophobic-dark-scary atmosphere of the movie.

An overall good and enjoyable movie that is nowhere near Alien or Aliens but is better than Alien Resurrection IMO. Give it a try and judge for yourself.",1113609600,4,2327,4.781094527363184

1565250,3,B00005JMZK,"I recently watched the UK verion of AVP.  Having referred to Amazon for the reviews, I find myself having to comment, for the first time, on what I have read.  One or two of the reviewers do not seem to fully understand what is going on in the films.

Firstly - Bishop.  ""Androids don't bleed red""?  Really?  (I'm not sure how to break this but they're not real - and neither is Santa) Since they're manufactured they can bleed pretty much any colour - there is such a thing as updating models (which is referred to clearly in one of the Alien films).

In the earlier Predator films you were, essentially, dealing with lone Predators who had come to hunt.  In AVP you were dealing with Predators who had come as part of an initiation ceremony - and as such had to earn those canons, (clearly evident if you watch the film) which the mature Predators obviously had earned before and therefore had available to use when they fought Glover/Arnie.  OK - fairly clear there then, and not really too complicated to understand.

The issue of sacrifices is covered by the fact that humans would be lured there - whether or not they used those sacrificial tables as time progressed is open to debate, but then as civilisation progressed and they became unwilling to die, then do you really think that the old bodies would be neatly tidied away?

The reason that there are no reference to Aliens or Predators in the Cambodian or Egyptian structures is because they were built independantly, using the kowledge they were given.

The increased speed of gestation is explained by another reviewer.  Yes, there is a discrepancy in the number of Aliens and hosts, which ought to be explained further but in one scene you watch the Predator walking across hundreds of human sculls - how long do these things live, do we know? - perhaps this is the reason for the high numbers and if they were unable to escape the walls of the pyramid they would not have made it to the surface.

The Queen had a valid reason to leave - her drones/soldiers (these creatures are clearly based on bees/ants) were under attack and she needed to fight/flee to survive.  If she could kill her attackers on the way, so much the better.  As for her using the drones to bite her - she was enclosed separately from them, in one scene you clearly see them coming to her en masse - something they'd been unable to do until that point.

The changes in the walls being every 10 minutes is specultation but did need to be covered a little more.  As for the calendar being metric - when did they say this was the Aztec calendar?  Since they were saying that this was the basis for 3 different civilisations this is something that could have been changed over the years by the different civilisations - hence this would be the Predator calendar, not Aztec.

The Predators can see what's going on inside a body, but since they use technology to do this it's not an automatic function (in fact this is shown clearly in previous films - they have different options for scanning - heat being the one we were first introduced to).  When the spectator Predators returned the body to the ship they would have assumed, since he had replaced his helmet, that he had escaped the facehuggers. As we all know, you should never assume such a thing in these films, but there you go - if that were the case, then half the films of this type would be very short indeed.  (""don't go into the dark room where you heard something and all your friends have been savagely murdered""... ""Oh, OK then, I won't"" - THE END).

In summary, this film is pretty much what should be expected of it - it is, after all, a special-effects driven movie.  Acting/plot should come way down the list but they actually come through better than I'd expected.  I can see how the characters should have had a chance to grow, but can also see why they cut that down.",1113177600,3,3874,4.492154065620542

By the way, it is way too flashy and dumb. It definitely deserved better.

""Alien Vs. Predator"" started out good. Along the way, as the humans were threatened by these alien forces, and the aliens were killing the people off, there was kind of a sense of hopelessness for the humans who were there investigating something. And, after the war between Alien and Predator started for real, it started to get really, really dumb. Partly because they only can have the amount of gore to fit a PG-13 and that the violence was SO fake!!! If you even stay for the end credits, you can see a very long list of puppeteers.

There's a lot of wasted potential in this film -- a great haunted house setting apparently inspired by ""The Thing"" is almost entirely wasted and the site is abandoned except for the destruction of it at the end; two of the three Predators are fumbling idiots and the last is a relatively cuddly guy who seems unaware that his relatives hunt and skin humans for sport; the tie between the human pyramid cultures is simply tossed out there, without anything being made of it, including how a ""heat plume"" could be spotted by cultures prior to the 21st century -- but overall, it's not a bad film. It has the requisite number of Aliens hissing and drooling acid, it has facehuggers and chestbursters and it has a pissed-off queen tearing up the joint.

There's a token attempt or two to tie this into Aliens lore -- the father of robotics' middle name is Bishop, and is played by the same actor as played the robot of that name in Aliens -- but mostly it's ""hey, these things are kewl!"" and tossing them all into the blender and hitting puree, without worrying much about the logic of what comes out.

For someone waiting years for the next part of the Aliens saga, this is a disappointment.

1565328,2,B00005JMZK,"A satellite identifies an unexpected heat source in Antarctica, leading corporate bigwig Weyland (Lance Henrikson) to hastily form a search expedition.  Foremost among the team is Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), a guide with experience traversing frozen terrain; Lathan's quite likeable in this movie, although she's certainly not on par with Ripley as a protagonist.  The team is told that their search will be risky, but the payoff seems worthwhile -- a giant pyramid buried under 2000 feet of ice.  When the crew arrives in Antarctica, they are stunned to find that a giant tunnel has been dug to the pyramid.  Before they know it, they're being attacked by two different species -- however, are they the prey or just unfortunate observers?

AVP is a decent sci-fi thriller with fairly good effects.  Unfortunately, we never get to know the expedition team well enough to muster any sympathy when they find themselves being attacked.  In addition, most of the scenes are staged in near-dark -- the film ends up looking dingy and the action is sometimes hard to follow visually.  Finally, the plot doesn't really kick into gear until about an hour into the movie, when the crew puts together the pieces.

AVP pulls from the mythology of both movie series.  As such, it's likely to please some fans of the Alien and Predator flicks.  I really enjoyed the Alien movies; however, I found myself fairly disappointed by AVP as it could have been so much better.  AVP is a decent b-movie, but not worthy of the Alien series.",1111276800,2,1516,4.856031128404669

1565392,4,B00005JMZK,"As a hard core fan of the Alien series, and a guy with almost no interest in the predator series, I liked this movie.

Poor Anderson (the director) had a lot to live up to.  Make a movie that satisfies fans who have been waiting upwards of ten years for a movie that successfully combines two popular franchises.  And don't forget that expectations were set astronomically high, so it was pretty much gauranteed that a lot of people would be dissapointed (Anybody remember ""The Phantom Menace""?).

I for one, enjoyed the movie.  I thought it had an average amount of action scenes that were well done.  The idea behind the pyramid and the artic setting was interesting, and the CGI and practical effects work were spectacular (Oh, and the use of red flares was a very nice touch).

True, 90% of the charachters are alien fodder with almost no interesting charachteristics (except for Sebastian, Lex, and Weyland), but you all came to watch two intergalactic species fight each other, not to see well developed charachters.  A lot of people seem to hate the idea of humans and predators joining forces, but I for one liked it.

I thought the action in the movie was quite enjoyable, especially during the last half hour, which features a lot of explosions, implosions, and green goop flying everywhere.

Of course, the movie isint perfect.  At less then an hour and a half long, it's very short.  Blink an eye and it's done.  Not a good thing, because there's very little time to develop the charachters or the plot.

But overall, I enjoyed the movie.  I for one, look forward to Alien vs. Predator 2.",1110758400,2,1600,4.664285714285715
1565393,5,B00005JMZK,"Being a fan of the original and best Predator (1) and Alien (1),
it was extremely naieve of me to expect a good movie here. Give it up Paul W.S. Anderson or in future try to remember that a  good percentage of your audience actually has a reasonable amount of grey matter upstairs..

p.s the Pally wally thing going on with Predator and the earthling really made me want to puke!",1110758400,,379,4.323943661971831
1565394,2,B00005JMZK,"Anderson knows exactly how to disappoint and often do the opposite of what his career suggested with ""Event Horizon"" with AvP going back to the fanboy basics of rewriting ""Mortal Kombat the movie"" and introducing Aliens and Predators as allegedly the principle players... for a on-screen running time of about eight minutes when they eventually manage to come together - ""Where is the AvP in AvP?"" ends up being question #2 next to question #1 - ""why is this PG13?"" Anderson usually says that it is the studio's fault (note - ""usually says"", as this is not the first time he has used the excuse; see - Soldier, Resident Evil 1 + 2 plus his Director's Comments on this DVD!) but if you look at Anderson's track record you can tell that the producers have known what their product was all along - *Aliens for Children*.

If they are going to slaughter a series at least choose one at a time. Here they manage hack both to death in one go. Is it economic for Hollywood to fail two franchises in the budget or something? Alien and Predator are high concept artistic science-fiction creations as a result of human qualities (fear, speed, technology strength etc). AvP is not `art' in any sense of the word. In fact while Alien and Alien 2, even Predator 1 and Predator 2 to some degree can lay claim to being ""art"" movies with AvP even having a worthy art series of graphic novels (please do not call them comics) all these appear to have been left sidelined for what is a fanboy Alien meets Predator... with the emphasis on the word `boy' ... and another on the fact that we know humour does not work here since Alien: Resurrection, the scene is set for an auditorium full of 12 year old going ""Hahahahaha"", ""yuccchk"" or ""cool look at the way that guy died"" or ""Yeah the Alien won that battle"", you don't care about any of the wooden-as-your-front-door cannon fodder characters that you saw in Braveheart as extras, or the fact that the set from Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 has been reconstructed, or the fact that the person sitting next to you in the auditorium is half your height as you mull over the changing times of having witnessed ALIEN in the cinema, you would at least expect a little more Alien Vs Predator and not an artic mission that takes up half the movie.

I will say this much - AvP is certainly the WORST Predator movie (how could it be any worse than this!), but maybe there is a chance that Alien: Resurrection can sit next to this one in the same sort of ""turkey entry"" vanity casting, there is plenty of reasons not to see AvP, but considering that this is the only sci-fi movie with a 2004/2005 Hollywood budget, you might be glad to know that it does do some interesting science fiction from time to time, so sci-fi lovers may sit through this as they did something like Riddick, knowing that both these films are not a patch on the original, the interesting few moments in AvP are the CGI generated blackflash historical fights between the two aliens; a nice earth-entry landing and the concept of Predators harvesting Aliens, maybe one fight sequence, but in the end little segments that you thought where good do not make a movie by any means. Trying to find another excuse for watching AvP, there is about thirty minutes of Lance Henriksen fanboy backside pucking-up, but then again that is about the best thing this movie has to offer, and Lance knows that with Ripley gone, Schwarzenneger a Governor and Glover chasing serial killers called SAW, he can bend over for as long as he likes... and he does! ... so watch it for him maybe... but little else. And hey yeah it does have a 3rd act Mother Alien Vs Predator ending with overtones of water as deep-space, but the double-dose-to-be-continued-endings really does raise questions about how much attention anyone paid in biology class aside for imagining what green guts look like on the floor --- brains firmly out the window and double to be continued in two directions maybe, this is like some of sort of sales pitch for the entire movie or what? I wish Cameroon and Scott could have done something before the completely artless fanboy bubblegum directors somehow get their hands on the concept.",1110672000,2,4171,4.582329317269076
1565395,4,B00005JMZK,"Ok, when you hear Alien vs Predator, like most of the reviews, the fan base is immense & understandably so. Hence the expectation level is of a very VERY high level ... we're not talking action fest with a cracking plot & sub-plot .... we're talking requirements for action, suspense, thriller, adventure, sci-fi, cgi etc etc ...  a lot to live up too !

Now, despite all the negative reviews, I have to say after just watching this flick, that I wasn't disappointed. Yes there could've been more, but that's because I'm a fan of both franchises (those that didn't know better are now checking Alien 1-4 & Predator 1 & 2) and as predictable could've enjoyed more screen time from the 'serpants' and the bad boys with body camouflage. However, when you think of past franchises that tried to satisfy both markets (ie, mainstream & loyal fan base) there are few that can pull it off (lets not talk about mmmm judge dredd for example)

All in all I think despite Mr Anderson's previous raspberry's, he's done a good job with this flick. It had a lot to cover in less than 2 hours, the DVD explains all for the loyal fanbase (inconsistencies stated in previous reviews on this stie are ... inconsistent !!)

Whether a fan of both franchises or not .. I would recommend this flick ...

There wasn't that much interesting happening in the middle of the screen, so I probably wasn't missing much happening on the edges.

  I'm not a devoted fan of either the Alien or the Predator franchise, and I suppose my ignorance has inoculated me against outrage.  I don't know alien incubation times, or when a predator has last visited the earth, and I don't remember what a predator is supposed to look like when he pulls his mask off. Also, I'm blissfully unaware that AVP offends the story lines of earlier movies.

  AVP is okay, but that's about it.  About my only beef is that the aliens didn't really versus the predators enough.  Probably a rental, but I'd recommend borrowing it from somebody if you can.",1110585600,4,868,4.76510067114094
1565398,1,B00005JMZK,"Those who somehow ""forget"" and ""ignore"" the past are bound to repeat the same mistakes. True in life and true in movie making. Could this latest ""instalment"" in this mega popular franchise, which was to feature two (Director please note) RUTHLESS, UNRELENTING and UNSYMPATHETIC Alien killers, be a possible return to the brilliance and tradition of Alien, Aliens and Predator? This was surely a no-brainer, right? It was a win-win situation - Two nasty evil Alien species going all out for a bit of the old ""Ultra-violence""? This surely had to get every Alien and Predator fan salivating in anticipation, right? But instead the majority of us (> than 10 year's old) are salivating alright and baying for blood at the same time! For starters PG-13? Oh Please....My Cousin Vinny has got a higher rating than AVP - I didn't encounter any Alien species in this film, did you? Being PG-13 is simply movie ""suicide"" for such a previous hard-core movie franchise! FOX take note - The fans DEMAND and EXPECT R-rated action when Alien species come out to play.

Everything about AVP is just plain wrong - don't concern yourself about the logic plotholes (of which there are many) - this entire film should have been left on the cutting room floor! Oh..we were teased by the trailers, we were teased by the looming Alien Vs Alien battles (remember they are both Alien species) - but that was it I'm afraid - in the end we were just teased. It seems that all the best bits (fighting scenes between the Aliens and the Predators) were in the 5 minute trailers! So what happened in the remaining time that made this movie so bad? For starters, the human characters (all of them) were insipid and uninspiring. There was no one that took this film by the throat and propelled it forward like Ripley and Dutch did. There was no ""Apone"" no ""Hicks"" and unfortunately no ""Hudson"" character either. Can you imagine if there was a ""Vasquez"" character in AVP? It most definately would have been Adios Muchachos for all Alien species - including the Director! OK, maybe I am a bit harsh on the lack of strong and likeable characters but how about these scenarios for sheer movie stupidity? -

The drilling team ""experts"" are somewhat ""astounded"" that a perfectly cut hole (at no less a 30 degree angle!) of a few thousand feet just somehow ""appeared"" overnight out of nowhere. Was anyone from this team of drilling experts ""slightly"" suspicious with this engineering marvel and with no evidence of a MOUNTAIN of ice that should have been present from this ""minor"" drilling exercise?

Your key central character (Mr ""I prefer the term artificial person"" Weyland) decides that he is going to give some lip and attitude to a 7 foot plus Predator AFTER being spared his life the moment before! ""Don't you turn your back to me!"" and then decides that a little BBQ action with the Predator is all good clean fun! WTF? Killing off your main actor drawcard so early on and in such a STUPID manner is inexcusable! Remember NONE of these characters had ever encountered these creatures before - they obviously look and behave extra-terrestial - hence your first priority is run, run really fast (do not go past go and collect $200) and head for the nearest exit and call the troops in ASAP!

Oh and the scene where the female lead character runs off with the Predator together (did you have the Bee Gee song ""staying alive"" or Vangelis's ""Chariots of fire"" running through your head?) after the Predator decides to do some Alien Origami for her. Huh? The Predator Elders no doubt watching the mayhem down below on their big screen Predator Plasma screens in the Stealth Craft must have been scratching their own skulls and thinking WTF? Remember in Predator, how Dutch was hunted down even to the point that the Predator jumped in the river (water and electronics don't mix well) to go after him? (Attention Director - The Predator does not play pat-a-cake with anyone!).

It was bad, but it got worse.....a lot worse!

The blatant rip-off of themes from Stargate, The Cube, Jurassic Park is just unforgivable for all that this film could have been. Where was ""old painless is waiting for you""? Where was the unrelenting tension that was present in Alien and Aliens? Why haven't the Directors of these past SciFi classics thrown their arms in the air and said enough is enough! Could you imagine Ridley Scott or James Cameron or John McTiernan directing AVP2 or Alien5? Oh yes please. Their movies were plausible, believable ans very well thought out. No HR Giger, no Stan Winston, no credible director = Doom = AVP!

Would an R-rated version possibly rescue AVP from oblivion? Alas I think not - unless they decide to shoot the entire thing again! But why are so many Fans really angry after watching AVP? Simple - a brilliant opportunity is lost! By all means see it and then watch Alien, Aliens and then Predator (again!). Your AVP DVD will fly faster out of your house than the Predator's disc! Trust me - my copy is firmly embedded in my next door neighbour's tree!

Please, and I mean please, if there is to be an AVP2 or Alien5 give us what the true fans DEMAND and EXPECT - white knuckle knock your-socks-off tension and action. Not some candy floss, watered down PG-13 rated illogical mess! Now I know when Hudson said ""game over man....game over!"" He must have seen a preview of AVP!

Now for the DVD itself (the one-disc, Region 4 edn). Both the picture quality and sound are first rate, as one would expect. The ""extras"" though are truely an insult (compare this with the Alien or Aliens special edn or the brilliant Alien Quadrilogy box set) and the so called extended edition (2 minutes extra at the start) does nothing to improve the picture. However, the biggest joke of all is the running commentary with the Director, Lance and Sanaa. I mean it left me wondering if they were watching the SAME film! Sanaa's comments about the face huggers was just rediculous! I am certain that she had no idea that several Alien and Predator films were made before this one!

I apologise that I have been very harsh here (from the hundreds of other negative reviews, I am not alone here), but when nearly a hundred million dollars is spent AND you have exclusive access to two of cinema's really nasty and believable ETs, is this all that one can come up with? ""Why? Why are the innocent always punished?"" Let's see if the R-rated version (If there is one?) is any better. As other reviewers have pointed out - For once the advertising was correct. When ever FOX wins - we all loose!

I have had a chance to get the Region 3 version (twin disc) of AVP - and I want to say that the material on the second supplementary disc is FIRST RATE and contains many useful features. Again why FOX didn't decide to release this two disc version for all regions is simply mystifying! The two disc version gets an extra two stars!

In conclusion - a lost opportunity for those who remember the past history on these nasty Aliens species and expected more. Now how does FOX convince the Governator to once again go-toe-to-toe with the Pred? Where can we send a petition to FOX? Why not have a competition where the fans can submit a story script or VOTE on the available scripts before more 35 mm is wasted? The Alien and Predator franchises should not end with a demise like this. Hell, AVP makes Alien Resurrection even partially acceptable...now that's scary.",1110499200,5,7416,4.656990068754775
1565399,3,B00005JMZK,"...I have to agree with those who give the movie 1 star and those who give it 4 (but that is how far as it goes because it's not a 5 star movie!). The thing is that Alien vs Predator could have been a lot worse. The way the creatures look (the aliens/alien-predators I mean), well, they're perfect ""in their ugliness"". And the rest of the movie looks good too. The pyramid, the halls. Well, the movie works visually, it works indeed -the problem is what Alien-fans notice too many times during AvP, the lack of research and ""history"" behind the previous Alien-movies (I haven't seen the Predator-movies). As a fan of Alien 1-3 I must say that this movie is not worthy of becoming a part of the Alien-saga. But at the same time -because of my low expectaions (real low) the movie surprised me in a positive way as an entertaining, watchable piece. And still the creators lack of ""inspiration"" (or so it seems) makes the whole experience a little ""braindead"". And sometimes embarrasing.

The picture is fantastic, the sound too (dts) - but the acting is not very good (and I'm not surprised). But remember that the acting in Camerons' Aliens wasn't much to brag about either. What this movie is missing is a Ripley-character (and an actress like Weaver of course)!

There are many flaws in AvP, and this way the scriptwriter and director Paul Anderson seems a bit lazy -and he does not impress me. And all in all this movie does not make me ""hunger"" for yet another sequel. It's watchable, that's all and I've seen the so-called ""extended"" version on the extreme edition. The movie is missing nerve, and adventure not least. The magic isn't quite there, and it surprises me that they used this director. The only good thing about his previous work ""Event Horizon"" is the sound. His storytelling seem to be missing something.

**Very slight spoilers ahead**

The voyage to Antarctica to explore the ancient structure, draws the viewer in at a measured pace, giving us an opportunity to meet the main players and to anticipate the thrills to come. The characters are reasonably three-dimensional - Sanaa Latham came over as a bit of an arrogant know-all at first, but I certainly warmed to her later.

The scene-setting, with the ""Chariots of the Gods"" motif, includes a delightful pseudo-historical scenario, which gives the fans what they've always wanted to see in a movie - H.R. Giger's nightmarish creation on Earth (where *everyone* can hear you scream!).

The main action sequences occur in the impressively labyrinthine pyramid and are certainly competently executed and brilliant at times.  The theme of humans earning the respect of the Predators, which cropped up in both P1 and P2, is taken a step further here and I was certainly rooting for Sanaa Latham by the end. I also felt that the link to both franchises was both respectful and reasonably plausible.

The CGI is flawless, the attention to detail (just check out the carvings on the walls, predator armour and weaponry etc.) impeccable, 5.1 DTS sound is everything you'd expect and, if you have bought the ""Extreme Edition"", you get some genuinely interesting extras, which are definitely a cut above the usual ""making of"" type documentary.

It's not an 18, so horror buffs expecting a gore-fest may feel a tad let down. I enjoyed it though (probably more so than the hugely disappointing Alien Ressurection) and am not ashamed for AvP to stand in my DVD rack just to the left of the Alien Quadrilogy.

But, as a set, it's a good set. I've viewed some of Predator, but really could not get into it. I saw this filmed based upon my love for the Alien saga. I went into it knowing it would be bad, and guess what, I was right.

It's nothing more than an action flick with a few aliens thrown around. It doesn't have the charm from the cast, nor does it provide ANY screams, or even ATTEMPTS to scare it's viewers. Any characters that are even a hint of interesting (Which, there are VERY few) are killed off fairly quickly. When they are killed off, it's rather confusing. With the pyramid shifting and all that junk, it's hard to tell who's still alive and who had been taken.

The basis of the film isn't bad, since the connection was already made in Predator 2. This could have actually been a good film, but in all reality, it could have easily been Predator 3. This is the Predator's film. Even the fights between the two weren't interesting, nor was the whole shifting of the pyramid chaos.

Soon there were comic books, and an actual screenplay that made the rounds of conventions and websites.  It was filled with intense action and great characters.  How could Fox possibly screw this up?

The studio announced Paul W.S. Anderson as the project's director.  Every film this man has touched has been a disappointment (Soldier, Event Horizon, Resident Evil).  They are the cinematic equivalent of Faberge eggs: wonderful to look at, but hollow.

The original screenplay was jettisoned.  The new one (written by Anderson) flew in the face of established logic from both franchises.  Predators, you see, are big lizards.  They are drawn by HEAT and conflict.  They hunt down humans and use their skulls for decoration.  So what does Mr. Anderson do with them?  He sends them to Antarctica--the coldest place on Earth--and states that they were worshipped by ancient civilizations as gods!  And the Alien being here in the present?  The Alien films were set 100 years in the future, and Ripley and Co. spent a great deal of effort making certain they never made it to Earth.

The final nail in the coffin was news that these two very hard R-rated franchises would meet under the banner of a studio-dictated PG-13 rating and a too quick 90-minute running time.

So what are we left with after 14 years of hype and anticipation? Nice looking sets, some impressive digital and creature effects, and the film's saving grace: a climactic battle with the queen alien that is worthy of the best Alien films.

But if you are a fan of the two series that this is stolen from, watch for camera work and visuals that harken back to both sets of earlier movies.  This was the sole redeeming factor for me as a viewer that relieved some bit of tedium from wading through the plot.  The creators of AVP lifted bits of dialogue and particular camera shots directly from early movies of the Alien and Predator saga to honor what had gone before and its fun to recognize them.  I thought this at first was accidental when you note a Predator helmet on board their space ship mirroring the illuminated numbers of a screen as the ship approaches earth. (Recall the first Alien film in its opening moments.) But then I noted other shots as well and decided to sit back and watch for them.  For this viewer, the movie is a heavy handed derivative of two innovative series and it adds nothing but confusion to the movement of the storylines.  I will give credit to the director for at least making a general attempt to stay within the proper narrative.  I have never forgiven Alien 3 for its blatant and arrogant disregard and disdain for the mythic universe created around the first two films by inserting a major plot device that was simply not possible.  AVP does not stoop quite that low.  It simply copies, and copies, and copies again.  Hard to fault their affection, but easy to forget this film.",1109289600,,1478,4.477611940298507

""Alien vs. Predator"" has made a dream showdown between science-fiction creatures. Who demanded this showdown? Viewers? Or marketing honchos? I'm guessing the honchos.

""AVP"" utilizes quality special effects to carry this film. Big money made this film worth seeing. If you were a fan of the Alien creatures or the Predators, then this film should be added to your collection.  The script could have used some fine-tuning. Did there need to be humans involved in this film? Probably not! Sanaa Lathan (Alexa Woods) fits nicely in a human lead role.  Lance Henriksen (Charles Bishop Weyland) is nothing more than recognizable character from the Alien series.

Maybe the sequel should go something like this; eliminate the human element and go to the Predator and/or Alien's home planet. See how the Predators live, grow and utilized advanced technology.  And of course the question on how the Aliens would travel to each planet would have to be answered. Is there an advanced Alien species caretaker? A species that makes sure the Aliens feed.

Ok enough of that, as for the movie; surprisingly I found myself really liking this movie long after I watched it.  I did like it when I was watching it, but the more I thought about it afterward the more I liked it.  The plot is actually pretty smart and the action scenes are great, especially the fight scenes involving the Alien and Predator.  But alas, the actors are second-rate nobodies with the exception of Lance Henriksen.  What Alien movie would be complete without him?  It really helps tie them all together.  Plus, it makes you wonder, was Bishop made in his image?  The other Alien movies where set in the future, this one is set in the present, so we know the Alien race is living on in corners of the universe.  This is a dominating creature; all it does is kill and breed.

The story starts as the satellite of a rich industrialist picks up a heat signature in a remote island off the coast of Antarctica, 2000 feet below the surface.  A team of experts is quickly pulled together to find out what it is.  As a note, just because the actors are unknown, doesn't mean they aren't decent.  The lead character, an environmental expert/explorer played by Sanaa Lathan, shows strength, determination and tenacity...everything a young actor wants to show off.  She gets to run, jump and tell the lead character that they aren't ready for this expedition that will take them to unknown areas of the earth.  What happens next may seem predictable, but the twists and turns that come with it are actually surprising and entertaining.

Also, the DVD offers a slightly extended cut of the film in addition to the version offered in theaters, as well as some commentaries, so you get a good bit more than just a movie for your rental dollar or purchase price.

Even the basic premise of the flick--bringing together two of cinema's most beloved extraterrestrial villains--is bound to fail on some level.  Doesn't mean the movie isn't entertaining, though.  The special effects are astounding (the aliens have never looked so alive, the predators never so...predatory).  And there's the guilty-pleasure of seeing the insectile creatures that took on Sigourney Weaver fighting the humanoid monstrocities that almost killed Danny Glover and the Governor of California (and DID kill the former Governor of Montana).

The acting isn't always up to par, though Lance Henrisken sinks his teeth into his minor role (as always), and Sanaa Lathan makes her stereotypically-shallow role at least watchable.  The script leaves a lot to be desired, and there are plot points that got left out (due to the studio, from what I've heard, though I can't prove a thing).  All these negative things might make you thing you're in for a bumpy ride...and you are.  The GOOD kind of bumps.

I was surprise to see Sanaa Lathan is actualy a very decent actress, I quite hoping if they really must do anohter AVP they will put her in. Segorney's character was very emotional, Sanaa's was on a more calm side which says her job as a professional. There is a few scene that I like very much in this movie, the scene that spot the 'cool' predator-J(the one who mark a 'J' on his helmet) come to a room and chop down the lil mouth-suckers and cut the head of a alien's head off professionally so would kill it but theres no acidic blood splash out. And the scene after they came out of the ancient site after the explosion, the predator-J gave the girl a little J mark on her face, that's pretty cool too, I like it.

I think the last part of the movie is pretty weak, once the girl found her predator friend(which is kindda predictable), everything goes on then is very predictable, the tracing of alien queen, the explosion, the last fight between queen and predator, they are all somewhat borrowed from the last movies and reflesh nothing new.

1565623,4,B00005JMZK,"I, like so many fans of the Alien and Predator series have been looking forward to a story featuring these two super creatures on the big screen for quite some time.  Despite some MAJOR glaring continuity error's from the original alien films and also the subsequent predator movies, I personally felt that for all of these problems, I still enjoyed the film.

Were there problems combining these two franchises together?  ABSOLUTELY.  There was much that was removed from the original script which went on to explain several of these errors, such as the incredible speed with which the aliens would be implanted, burst and grow to full size in...this being just one example of what apparently WAS in the script, but due to pressure from the film company, was edited out in order to achieve a more viewer-friendly PG13 rating.  While I see the reason for doing this, I also feel it, deep down, screwed up the enjoyment of the film overall.

I also noticed one problem from the original Predator films that seemed to be totally absent from AVP: from what I can gather, the sweltering heat of the jungle featured in the first movie and the major heat-wave they were experiencing in Pred-2 gave me the distinct impression that hot, humid weather had to do with the where and when the Predator's did their hunting.  Now we see them in about the most opposite weather scenario you can have on planet earth in AVP.  Continuity error?  Yup.  I also found the coming to hunt every 100 years or so to be another HUGE error from the original films vs. AVP.  When you get right down to it, there were SO MANY I am virtually amazed I actually enjoyed the movie at ALL -- but I did.  I still had a fun time watching two of the greatest bad guys Hollywood has ever put on film going at it toe-to-toe.  The special effects were, by and large, rather impressive.  While many (and I do mean many) problems exist between the original films of both the franchises and this version, I have to say I enjoyed it better than the last two Alien films combined, especially Alien Resurrection.

Will there be an AVP2?  Most likely.  What I am waiting for however, is the Directors Cut of AVP which will no doubt explain much of the problems that pretty much everyone who has seen the films have noticed and had problems with...but there are so many of them I seriously doubt that even HALF can be taken care of sufficiently.  Still, if AVP2 hits the big screens and is PG13 will I see it?  I'd have to say YES.  My son is just now discovering Aliens and Predators and he thought the film was just about the greatest movie EVER (but you have to realize he thinks the sequel to Dumb & Dumber was better than the original...).  As a friend of mine pointed out when we were watching Terminator 2 and I was busy commenting on some of the films un-real scenes, 'Just enjoy the movie as is.  It isn't supposed to be rocket science.'  And he was right.  Sure, Hollywood is more concerned with the bottom line rather than actually making good cinema any longer, but I still enjoy a fun alien movie with great special effects.  Here's to hoping the next AVP movie will be able to close the gaps created by this movie.

This story has been a long time in the making.  Although a comic reader, I never picked up on the Dark Horse comic series bringing the races from Alien and Predator together. But even in print it seemed like a good idea. Plenty a fanboy (or -girl) conversation begins with ""Who do you think would win...""  The biggest, baddest game hunters meet the biggest, baddest game.  They're a natural pairing, right up there with Frankenstein vs. the Wolfman or Freddie vs. Jason.  In a way, they serve to make their universe feel more complete, sharing it.  That's some biodiversity there.  We're not talking distinctive head-ridges as the chief means of alien identification.

It's a good idea.  It could make a grand movie, even for audiences too young to remember (or want to seek out) the inspiration.  But it's hampered by a few flaws in execution.

First among them: the absence charismatic characters. There's nothing wrong with a big ol' creature fest, but this movie doesn't start out to be one.  We spend quite a lot of time on setting up characters and situations before we settle down into our variation of what Joe Bob Briggs would call ""spam in a cabin""-people trapped in a perilous house from which they cannot escape.  Anyone we have any impulse to root for is quickly snuffed.  We have no reason to feel sympathetic for our hero except that we share human DNA.  It's not enough to justify the attention to set-up.  We should have gone more quickly for the main event.

Second: there are some embarrassingly bad plot points.  I can't discuss these in any depth without giving too much away.  A couple of small ones: these Predators, these master-huntsmen in the universe, do they strike you as the sort to go anywhere without being fully armed?  Me, neither.  And the event that drew the humans' attention to this deeply buried arena-well.  The explanation for it is groan-inducing.  That's all I can really say.

Third: I'm used to getting lost in battle scenes.  When people start hopping around and blood of whatever color starts splashing, I just sit back and wait to see who walks out.  Once in a while, I find a movie that makes all the rapid back-and-forth of hand-to-hand (or gun-to-claw) combat easy for me to make out.  Once in a while I find one that makes it even harder than usual.  This falls into that latter category.  When even my husband can't figure out what the action is, there's some problem in cinematography.  A few too many close-ups, methinks, during high-action activity.

Nevertheless, those action scenes are the biggest payoff in the movie.  The aliens are still big and bad; the predators are still big and bad.  And it is kind of fun to see them getting together.  In a pretty cool location.  For big chunks of this movie, my inner fangirl had something worthwhile to cheer.

And if that's all you're looking for in this movie, then you'll probably have a good time.  If not, maybe you should consider a marathon of the originals instead.  Cinematically speaking, it'll be a more satisfying experience.  And you can indulge in a round of ""Who do you think would win"" after.",1108425600,2,3293,4.677137870855148

1565679,2,B00005JMZK,"Understand that even with a two star rating that I enjoyed watching this movie; it is just that I had to turn my brain off.  There are more holes in this plot than in a round of Swiss cheese.  The plot holes are unfortunate because the premise of Aliens fighting predators with humans caught sort of in the middle was interesting.

A satellite owned by Weyland Corporation, headed by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen!), spots a heat source under an ancient pyramid, under a couple thousand feet of ice.  The heat source must have been really big current day sensors to spot it.  Someone should tell the Navy about this to aid in underwater detection of submarines.  When the Aliens melted the snow and ice to get to the pyramid you would have thought that a heat source thousands of times greater than the energy put out by the pyramid would have been detected by somebody.  Also, you would think after encountering the Aliens in previous movies and consistently fairing poorly that Lance Henriksen would have learned his lesson.  I like Lance Henriksen, but how many times can one person be killed or maimed by Aliens?

Anyway, Weyland puts together an expedition to the pyramid, just coincidentally at the same time Predators arrive, which in retrospect has to be on a routine Alien hunting trip.  You can imagine that the Predators are upset that the humans are in their hunting lodge.  Anyway, humans cause an Alien queen to be awakened and start laying eggs, which also triggers the closure of the pyramid.  Just before the pyramid closes the Predators arrive and slip under the door as it closes.  We soon learn that the pyramid reconfigures itself about every 10 minutes, because the creators of the pyramids, Aztecs, I think, worked on a metric system.  The only problem is that the Aztecs used a base 20 numbering system, which is definitely not metric, which is base 10.  Okay, every movie can be forgiven some implausibility, so move on.  Wait a moment, there are places where it seemed like the pyramid was reconfiguring itself in just two or three minutes, and then for a lengthy period in the last part of the movie the action went on for a long time while the pyramid did not move at all.  Perhaps I can forgive yet another implausibility.

The Alien eggs soon begin to hatch and humans and Predators fall prey to the spidery little Alien hatchlings.  Soon fully grown Aliens start preying on the humans.  Wait a moment.  I thought Aliens took longer than an hour or two to get to full size.  I guess for the sake of action and pace logic is continuing to be suspended.  I also wonder whether I was the only one to notice that there were far more fully grown Aliens than there were dead human hosts.  Since the Predators did not bring extra victims with them where did all the hosts come from?  Also, the hatchlings seem to emerge from the humans in a matter of minutes versus the much longer period of time we saw in the first Alien movies.  I realize at this point that I am thinking too much about plot consistency.  Actually, thinking about this movie at all hurts at this point.

The Aliens, humans and Predators all mill around in the pyramid trying to kill each other to the end of the movie.  The relatively soft humans are really little sport for either the Aliens or the Predators.  What surprised me was that the Predators were not that much of a match for the Aliens.  I would have thought that their armor and helmet would have been durable enough to withstand the Alien blood and the little fanged mouth part that comes jetting out, but apparently the helmets were about as strong as plastic and had nearly no resistance to Alien mouth parts.  Curiouser and curiouser.  I leave the ending to the patient viewer to discover.

This movie really has no relationship to previous Alien movies at all.  It can not have any relationship because if it did it would make even less sense.  For example, the movie implied Aliens come to Earth every 100 years.  I guess someone should tell Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Glover that they are dealing with rogue Predators who do not follow the rules of the worst movie in this series.  Also, the movie said that human sacrifices were expected, yet the Predators brought none with them.  What is up with that?  First, in earlier movies Predators were hunting humans and we were seen as one big hunting ground.  Now the Predators have no interest in us and never have?  Second, we know that Predators find it easy to capture us, so getting sacrifices would have been easy.  I do not buy that heat from the pyramid was supposed to attract victims to the pyramid.  How could the Aliens know enough would show up?

Lastly, given the violence and R-rating of the previous movies, I recognized that the studio toned the movie down so that the movie could be watched by younger audiences, as though this was a good thing.  Relaxing the standards of the previous movies in addition to the constant logical lapses detracted significantly from the movie for me.

I enjoyed the first two Alien movies immensely.  The third and fourth movies were fair, but made an attempt to be logical and consistent.  This movie decided that they could make anything up they needed to create some sort of plot without considering that viewers might actually think about the movie.  Of course, given that the Predators act like a bunch of rednecks anyway, maybe that is what was expected.  Watch this movie for the action, but do not ascribe any sort of coherency or thought to the plot.",1108339200,2,5533,4.629363449691992

Danny Glover?'...in his defense, he was a hot property, appearing in Lethal Weapon 2 a year earlier).  The sequel was certainly mediocre, but the ending, with the appearance of the Alien skull in the trophy room (and the illusion that someone someday would make a film worthy of these two monumental characters), almost made the whole experience worthwhile (actually, those of us who read comics throughout the 90's were treated to a number of Predator/Alien match ups, which really only served to fuel the fire).  Written and directed by Paul `You either love him or hate him' Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Resident Evil), the film stars the very curvaceous Sanaa Lathan (Blade), the extremely Italian Raoul Bova (Under the Tuscan Sun), and the always crusty Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, Pumpkinhead, Alien).

At the start of the film we see a satellite, own by the Weyland Corporation, orbiting the Earth, taking pictures, focusing on an area in the Antarctic.  Thermal imaging indicates a large power source sitting underneath a ancient pyramid (all under 2,000 feet of ice), which peaks uber rich industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland's (Henriksen) interest enough to warrant a full scale expedition, and so begins the gathering of various specialists together, including ice climber and guide extraordinaire Alexa `Lex' Woods (Lathan) and archeologist Sebastian de Rosa (Bova), among others...but they're not the only ones making the trip, as we also see a Predator spacecraft arriving into Earth's orbit.  The expedition does find the subterranean pyramid, but their presence activates the emergence of a shackled Queen Alien, who begins laying gooey eggs as part of some as of yet undefined process that will eventually include not only the humans, but the Predators as well.  What's the purpose of the pyramid, and how are the Predators and Aliens involved?  Well, I could tell you, but I don't think that would be fair to those who haven't seen the film (I purposely avoided reading anything about this film, as I wanted to go into it `fresh'.)

So, was our lengthy wait for a Predator/Alien match up justified with this film?  According to many the answer would be no...and, for the most part, I would tend to agree.  The main problem is, in my opinion, that expectations were very high, so high in fact many had doubts prior to the film even before it was released.  I, on the other hand, came into this movie with limited expectations, and still was a trifle disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I really liked the fight scenes between the Aliens and Predators, what little of it there was (it takes almost a full hour before we first see the two tussle)...and the creatures effects were handled very well...there were just so many inconsistencies in the story.  One problem, among many, was the gestation and subsequent maturation of the aliens themselves...prior Alien films indicated this wasn't a process that took only a couple of hours (as in this film), but at least a day or two...maybe these were aliens of the `quick gro' variety.  Also, what was the point of the interior of the pyramid changing its' configuration every ten minutes?  The only reason I could think of was because it was in the script...and the film indicates Aliens and Predators have been on the Earth for hundreds, if not thousands of years...how come no one had found evidence of this prior to the events in this film?  Okay, I can see how the Predators, with their advanced technology, could keep their arrival on Earth a secret given our current state of technology (via the use of cloaking devices, I suppose), but what about when they fired that intense laser beam from space, melting a giant hole 2,000 feet through the ice to access the pyramid?  Seems to be if we can detect a comparatively minimal heat source beneath the pyramid, we should also be able to detect the sustained laser blast, if not the source...the story is full of stuff like this, things that just don't make sense.  The acting wasn't bad, but the human characters are lifeless and serve no purpose other than to facilitate the story...I know, I know, the human element isn't what we came to see in this film, so their role is in accordance to the story, but I would ask why have them in the movie at all?  Just give me the Aliens and Predators...imagine that, and entire film with these two alien species, no dialogue at all...that would have been interesting.  Anderson's direction is passable, but borders on shoddy more than I would have liked.  Oh, and let's not forget the PG-13 rating...strange that the individual films featuring the Aliens and Predators were all R rated, and yet a meeting between the two would be reduced to kid friendly material.  All in all I'd call this a film of missed opportunities worth renting for a few scenes, but not much else.

The picture looks good (some scenes were a bit murky, though), and the special features are listed on Amazon, so I won't bother rehashing them...one thing I found annoying about the extras was the amount of plugging by Fox...just gimme the film, for crying out loud, and quite trying to bury me in all your promotional junk.

It is hard to take comic book characters come alive with any great success but this is the best ever with regards to any type of alien.

I was glad to see Lance Henricksen back [the forrunner of Bishop]and my Predator was great.  All the actors fit the parts they were playing with great success.  The execution of the difficult shots were fabulous.

1565682,3,B00005JMZK,"I have read review after review trashing this movie.  As a fan of the Predator movies, I can definitely agree that this is an inferior installment.  It just doesn't have the intensity of the previous movies, and it isn't as engaging, nor are the characters engaging.  The monsters just don't generate suspense in this movie as in the older ones.  Also the story just failed to capitalize on all its potential.  But its not it's the worst movie ever made, as some reviewers might lead you to believe.  Yeah, its not as good as the the other movies in these franchises, but it is really a fun action flick.  It has a neat story, some cool effects, and a great scary environment in the ancient pyramid.  Of course the fight scenes are fun to watch.  There are some really cool inovations, and subtle nods at the previous films.  On the whole I would say this movie is very enjoyable, though it's not another classic.",1108166400,,913,4.512195121951219
1565683,3,B00005JMZK,"I'm a big fan of both franchises, and own all the movies. Including this one. Yes, overall, it could have been better. But the special effects of both species was the best of all of the past movies, ie, the latest computer effects.

I agree that this type of movie surely should have been a rated R type, since the past ones were. And deservedly so. But today's movies are now largely geared towards children and friggin' teens! That's the problem. Revenue. That sucks.

And even though I am not a fan of this director, I have to admire his obvious love for both of the alien species characters. They looked sleeker and better than ever - especially the Predators! And the ending with the Jurrassic Park-like alien mother was very cool.

No, the storyline wasn't nearly as strong as it should have been. Yes, they had tons of comic book and graphic novels to match up to - and didn't. Yes, most of the actors - especially the lone surviving black woman - was pretty bad in acting and believability. But overall, I've seen much worse films. I was never bored. And the look of the film and action scenes were cool.

Dark Horse's graphic novel would've cost a huge bundle to make on film. Obviously, because of all the bad hype the reviewers here and the audience gives these films, surely doesn't give producers much promise of their money back. And that, my friends, is the bottom dollar.

I, for one, liked the film. I saw it when it came out, and I own the DVD. I still like the film. Despite all the 'what should've and could've beens'. And I will support future endeavors. Because that is what a fan does. (And hope new producers and directors of the near future take this franchise, which still has tons of material to be filmed, and show it for all its bloody and exciting glory.)

1565684,3,B00005JMZK,"This is indeed one movie/confrontation that could have/should have been better than it was. The potential was definitely there for something better but it didn't materialize.
The movie DOES have some pretty impressive moments throughout its' journey but with the plot as lacklustre as it was it was  unable to deliver the necessary knock out punch.
I am a big fan of BOTH the Alien and Predator series and it was a natural that these two characters be brought together eventually to the movie screen. It was certainly set up in Predator Two where for a brief moment while Danny Glovers' character is battling a Predator on his ship we see in the background a trophy area where one of them happens to be an Alien skull.
I followed the comic series which brought them together and took both creatures to areas(character and plot wise) that  I didn't always agree with but were at least entertaining.
So my hopes were high for a film adaption. I think a much too conservative approach was used in the plot development and it suffered as a result.
As I said there were several good moments in the picture,the fight scenes being very good and dark lighting was used very effectively throughout  to enhance the mood wherever appropriate.
However when I thnk of the first Star Trek movie and the mixed reviews it received and which itself could have been better than it was but  took another picture to really get itself up and running, I can only hope that we have a similar situation in the making here.

We have two gross monsters shooting disgusting goo at each other for an hour and a half, and everyone but the girl with the cleavage dies at the end.

It amazes me how people automatically downgrade a movie because there is a black person in the lead. I have seen a few comments regarding Predator 2 on here which starred a black male in the leading role. I feel if Angelina Jolie or another white female had been cast as the lead actress this movie would have gotten higher ratings. I thought the action scenes were very well put together and I liked the storyline. It didn't bother me one bit that the story line wasn't anything like the original Alien movies - in fact I think that's why out of all of the Alien and Predator movies I liked this one the best. I am not saying the movie was perfect - there were a couple of things that didn't sit well with me such as the Predator making Sanaa Lathan a shield out of the Aliens head because his acidic blood would have ate through her arm - but it wasn't enough to make me throw my hands up in disgust and rant and rave about how bad of a movie this was. I feel it was job well done and I would go to see any sequels.,1107388800,3,1144,4.066371681415929
1565757,1,B00005JMZK,"Both the Alien and Predator franchises are ripe with possibility and promise.

This film, much like Predator 2, ignores it all.  Some say not to blame the director, but he had many of the creative decisions, and it was his call to place this in modern day Earth.  Those of you that have seen the Alien movies will remember that it takes place far in the future, and that the humans needed to go lightyears from Earth to find the Aliens.

Apparently they didn't need to, because Paul W.S. Anderson believes they have been on Earth at least as long as the humans have.

Anderson, for what it is worth, captures many of the scenes well.  Unfortunately the action isn't among this, and the action sequences are CGI blurs that will make you long for the days of special effects over computer effects.

The name is a bit of a farce, as well, as the Aliens and Predators fight maybe two or three times.  In fact, the action is very, very low (thankfully, perhaps, due to how awful the action directing is.)  The first half of the film is buildup.  It introduces you to characters you don't like yet gives them no depth.  It spends a great deal of time explaing what needn't be explained.

Finally, halfway through, you get to what should be the good stuff.  Nope.  Almost all of the characters die within the first 10 minutes of the action.  You're left with so few characters that you know the outcome.  No tension at all.

This film missed it's potential.  There are no big battles.  There is no question over who will live and who will die.  In fact, the only question you'll have (aside from plotholes) is whether the Predator and human will kiss, because the romantic tension builds much quicker than the survival tension.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is a travesty, much like this film.",1107388800,5,1785,4.532915360501567
1565758,1,B00005JMZK,"Paul W.S. Anderson is a crappy director, almost as crappy as Michael Bay. This movie should've been categorized as a comedy because I was laughing throughout the entire thing. There were tons of cheesy lines, not to mention the chick in the movie outlives the predators. This is one of those movies where you're laughing that it's so bad, so if that's what you're looking for then go see it. I wouldn't recommend it.",1107302400,4,416,4.635135135135135
1565759,3,B00005JMZK,"A lot of people have bashed this movie, saying it's terrible and Paul W.S. Anderson is a horrible director who destroyed the movie we've all been waiting for. You might remember Anderson as the director of Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil, both decent, but not great movies. AVP is not as bad as most people say. It has its faults and it has its good parts too.

  Anderson is not a horrible director, he's just not very imaginative. His direction in the movie is run of the mill and there's nothing ever overly special about it. Lots of the visuals and sets are interesting and claustaphobic, giving the movie a tense feel most of the time. Antartica was a good place to set the movie in because it gives it that feeling of everybody being on an almost alien planet, battling creatures from another world and the elements.

  The story is average. Anderson, who also wrote the script, crafts a fairly plausible way to bring these two movie monsters together. It's not the most original, or entertaining story ever crafted, but like I said, it does bring these two villians together in a pretty good way. The main problem is the continuity. Some things that took place in the Alien series and the two Predator movies don't quite match up with what Anderson is talking about. The young Predators trying to prove themselves come to earth every 100 years to battle the aliens, but that time-line doesn't match up with the previous Predator movies. Also, the incubation time for the Aliens is greatly reduced, from about one day to about an hour or two. Minor gripes for the most part, but still kind of irritating in regards to story.

  Now for the part that I'm most angry about. The movie is rated PG-13. What happened to an R movie. All of the Alien movies and Predator movies are rated R, why not this one? I know 20th Century Fox was probably trying to reach a bigger market, but come on. These are horror action movies. Blood and gore is part of these movies, and it was pretty annoying that they took it out. I was a huge fan of the other recent movie villian match-up, Freddy VS. Jason, which was rated R, and both movies made about the exact same amount of money. So I'm still not quite sure why they did that, although I have to admit it was more violent than I had imagined it would be.

  Now on to some of the good things the movie offered. The Aliens and Predators. I think they both looked better in this movie then any of their previous movies. I was really happy that Anderson choose to use more of the costumed and animtronic Aliens rather than the mainly CGI Aliens that Ressurection implored to sub-standard results. Also, the battles between the two behemoths were well staged and wildly entertaining, especially the battle at the end of the movie with the Queen Alien in the abandoned Whaler village. The Predators weapons were also pretty cool in this movie and put to good use.

  Acting was standard for this type of movie. There were no real breakout peformances except for Lance Henrikson's, but I pretty much love anything he does, from past Alien movies, the TV show Millennium and countless other horror movies.

  My main hope is that if they do another movie, which I'm sure they will since this one performed decently enough, they'll make it R instead of the friendlier PG-13 rating and come up with a story without so many continuity issues.",1107302400,,3372,4.554635761589404

The cast and their acting did neither the Alien series nor the Predator series any justice. The score was cheesy. And why... why oh why did they have to use CG imaging for the chest-burster scene? All the previous Alien flicks did just great with their slimy little puppets. (Side thought: is it just me or were the predators more detailed in the Predator movies). The comradery between the main character (who happened to be the worst actor in the whole movie if you ask me) and the Predator was laughable. First he fashions her a spear from the severed end of an alien's tail, a stick and some string (Predators always have string), then he fixes her up an arm shield from the decapitated head of an alien. If anyone knows anything about this particular breed of alien, you can't put your friggin' arm inside their head or it will burn off in a painful acidy kind of burning that would hurt. The ending of this scene was absolutely the corniest thing in any movie ever... allow me to elaborate: after arming the pretty black girl who wears nice looking pastel winter clothes on ice expeditions with the alien tail spear and the alien head shield, they run off together, the camera catching only their silouhettes as they heroicly fade into the stage lighting. Oh, let's not forget about the demolitions expert guy with the grandma sweater and the bleached hair.

Now, those of you who are taking the time to read this are probably wondering if I have any thought out positive comments about this flick. My answer to you is yes I do... not many of them... but nonetheless positive insight to this film awaits those who read on...

Like I said before, the fighting is awesome. The CGI aliens came out way better than I would have imagined. To finally see how exactly badass the aliens are, to at last see how capable and formidable they are was quite satisfying. They reminded me stangely of the velociraptors I was so fond of in the Jurassic Park series. And the queen, when she finally got out into the open and wasn't restrained by the abilities of puppetry (which I still prefer over CGI) she reminded me of the t-rex from Jurassic Park. Not a bad thing... just a thing.

Needless to say, there was a lot left to be desired... I'm not even going to get started on the abundance of technical flaws pertaining to the mythology of these extremely cool space creatures... there are other reviews to read that will fill anyone who cares in on that stuff. Nicely done, by the way, whoever wrote that review.

This meeting of two sci-fi horror creatures should have been a moment to remember...  Sorry, I'm still in a state of shock!  I agree with so many other disappointed fans on either side of the fence.  This movie will be remembered for what it could have been.

What was good - the special effects and fight scences were great. Thats about it.  I'm really pushing for 2 stars here because it really needed to draw upon linking up two on-screen franchises.

I don't understand....why crush/trash a potentially great linking story.  The previous alien movies took us to the edges of the universe to stumble on competent alien(s) built for survival and adaptation - lets keep them away from earth as they will eat us all.  Predator brought us the universal safari hunter based on a warrior-like culture and the strength to muster some unique weapons.  Lets look for the best sporting humans and test our war-like ways.  Both predator and alien found out that humans are a tough third party to deal with (at times).

I consider all of the alien and predator movies worth watching - Alien 3 kinda dropped the ball some and predator 2 gave us regular guys a sporting chance without the muscle and military might.  Predator 2 gave a glimpse of what could be - the trophy case with the alien skeleton!  Ohh...I would have liked to seen that hunt!

Well, we never had to leave plant earth.  The party was always here...ugg.  Predator ruled over humans and aliens provided passage rights to join the ranks of universal warriorism.  Why did we waste the time traveling around the universe for aliens?  Why did predator waste its time with soliders and cops?

This should have been in the future - past all of the previous encounters in either series.  Deep space, a search probe discovers a planet that appears to have something of interest, and something happened to the planet to freeze it in time.  This voyage certainly would have envolved the military (which they would have certainly known about both the predator and alien).  Perhaps a decendant of the resurrected Ripley could have been interested in this quest.  This confrontation on some new unchartered world could have sent a ripple through the entire universe and the box office.

No, it didn't happen.  Lets get these two creatures in the boxing ring fast as possible and that would be enough.  So many things flopped in this movie that the only hope of gaining a rating star or getting sales was the actual fighting itself.  The ending was a slap in the face for Predator who apparently would have been aware of aliens propagating technique.

Ninety minutes is way to short for this type of movie.  It screamed crappy Hollywood sequel just trying to make some money.

I didn't feel connected with any of the characters up until a few scenes near the end of the movie between the main predator and the main human.  I would say there were plot holes, but I think a movie needs a plot to have holes.  My personal opinion is that the plot wasn't developed enough in this short version.  Even the extended version on the DVD only adds a few minutes of footage that doesn't add much to the film. Aliens is supposed to be a horror film, AVP didn't even have suspense.

The special features on the DVD are abysmal. The deleted scenes amounted to just about 1 or 2 minutes of extra footage, nothing really interesting.  There were a few ads for other movies, and scene selections.

Hey, the Predator species has apparently been visiting Earth for a long time before they got hold of Arnold and Danny Glover!  They've built a pyramid with three major Earth cultures on it-but the only one that is recognizable to any degree is Egyptian, and that is done pretty badly (some of us moviegoers ARE intelligent enough to recognize Khmer and Mayan/Aztec architecture, P.W.S. Anderson).  I do seem to remember that the Predator race likes hot places from the previous films, but for some inexplicable reason they decided to build their structure in the coldest place on the planet-Antarctica.  Unfortunately, this is but one of the many plot contradictions in the film-but enough of logic.

Sanaa Lathan plays a paper-thin artic explorer/ice climber.  Lance Henriksen is a corporate mogul type; I guess this was before he got he got ripped in half by a Queen Alien.  The dialogue is rife with cliches lifted from the other films, like 'You are one ugly (fill in the blank)!""  It gets old pretty quick.

1565900,3,B00005JMZK,"As a moderate fan of this film's predecessors - namely the ""Alien"" series - I was eager to see this mighty-idea-of-a-flick long ago when Internet promotion flourished as much as a year before the film's theatrical release.  It's a mammoth undertaking to bring two screen legends to one place at one time - left to duke it out until the best, or most ugly, man/thing is standing.  It happened nearly two years earlier with the successful ""Freddie Vs. Jason"",  which went on to slash away a whopping $82.2 million dollars from US theater goers; plus it was surprisingly effective, ultra bloody, and even a bit scary.  ""Alien Vs. Predator"" grossed a couple million less, but made up for it with a far-sturdier script and dazzling special effects display.

The screenplay is well-below prolific, but as far as monster movies go it should win the Monster Oscar.  The dialogue is not jerky or forced, the settings are SMART (thank goodness it's set in present day, on Earth, and not on some unbelievable distant planet or some floating space ship - we've reverted to ancient history rather than space-age fiction), and the development and flow is speedy and quick with enough suspense in just the right places.  The writers deserve a loft paycheck for making such an unlikely meeting so much fun to watch, weaving the two movie franchises together (with direct assistance from the comic book, no doubt), and paying attention to plot and dialogue when other script writers would have relied solely on gore to sustain the movie.

The acting is less-than-impressive, but, again, the film creators were on-task to assist.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson along with a team of 6 other contributing scriptees excelled so astoundingly that they pumped enough appeal and energy into their cast - helping to elevate them from ""B"" movie actors to ""B+"" actors with the flip of a pen and the turn of a lens.  Sigourney Weaver is painfully absent (as a prequel, her character hadn't been born yet), but Arnold Schwarzenegger is thankfully M.I.A.  (Though it might have been fun to see Weaver cream Arnold's butt.)

The cinematography is unexpectedly progressive and smooth.  The camera movements, lighting, and set design are smart and efficient.  The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen, and certainly more convincing and impressive than any of this film's ancestors.  The long-headed, saliva-toothed Aliens are more alive than I've seen them before (mama Alien even comes out to run amuck this time), and Mr. Predator's dreadlocks have never looked more lively and quick.  The scenes in the ancient, underground pyramid get a bit too monotonous after a time, and the repetitive far-off eerie sounds (oh my we should be scared!) aren't as effective or as chilling as they ought to be, but you can't help but feel an impeccable rush of adrenalin when the two vile foes come face to face time and again.

Now that it's on DVD, see it.

1565901,4,B00005JMZK,"First off, let me say that you are reading a review from a mostly Predator fan, so bear with me....First off, I must say this film is excellent in many ways, from the action scenes to the sort of ""tie"" the two factions have at the end. There are, however, some flaws I would like to address:

-Storyline, while good in some aspects, has a few plotholes

-The Predators, though merely ""yautja"" (read the novels), should not have died so easily

-The Predators at the end should have easily seen the Chestburster inside the dead Predator...yet they did not...

-Iffy dialogue...some of it is bad

-Mr. Wayland's death was idiotic, he was spared by the Predator only to be foolish and attack it...dumbest death i've seen in any movie in quite a while

-PG-13....'nuff said...shouldn't have been butchered like it was...hopefully a Director's Cut is not that far off...

Now, I would also like to point out a few nice things...

-Predators are as awesome as ever

-Aliens are actually cool too (can't believe I admitted that...)

-The scene where the Alien guts the Predator with his tail as he's about to kill the main character was a classic moment...so cool (yet so sad...poor Predator...)

-Some things kinda follow the novel (which I will explain in a moment)

Okay, now to explain the ONE thing i've been reading a lot and keep hearing from people that it would NEVER happen under any circumstances...

-The Human-Predator team-up. People keep complaining that a Predator would never team up with a human...which is utterly false in every aspect, as not all Predators are this way. Just read the first AvP novel (which is the true AvP story), a Predator and a human (a woman at that) team up to stop the Aliens, and she later even becomes a hunter among the Predators (though not many like her...if any at all). She helped the Predator, and showed outstanding courage, which he admired her for (just like in the movie). Therefore, what happened in the movie was not only a reflection of the novels, but was also a very plausible and likely event.

Now that I'm done reviewing the movie itself...let's get to the DVD...

It has some nice features on it...but there's two features that were hyped beyond belief before the DVD released that I feel were very poor:

-Extended Version...wow...a whole 2 minutes...and it didn't even help you understand the story any better...it was only another off-screen death to help sell the DVD...

-Deleted Scenes: Wow...you get one of the guy finding the bottle cap that is extended...big whoop...you get another that shows a guy's alternate death (which was already off-screen and still is in the deleted version)....and then there's the 3rd and final deleted scene called ""Predator Humor"" which I thought was actuall funny and there was really no reason to take it out of the film (basically the Predator scares the woman by making the dead Alien's inner jaw (I guess it's a tongue...) snap at her by hitting a tendon in it's brain with a knife...)

All in all...the DVD is well worth it for AvP fans...it's what we've been waiting for...and now we must wait and pray for an R-rated director's cut so we can see how the movie should have been...4 stars out of 5",1106870400,4,3200,4.714542190305206
1565902,1,B00005JMZK,"Lately many DVDs, especially those targeting youngsters, force you to watch a series of movie previews before you gain control of your DVD player. This is one of those DVDs.

However, this DVD will not let you skip the previews - every time you put the disk in the DVD player you are forced to watch previews of other moviews for what seems like an eternity before you can access the main menu.

1565903,1,B00005JMZK,"Let's assess the ""ancestors"" of this ""continuance"": ""Alien"" was a genuine thriller with a surprising heroine in the person of ""Ellen Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver); James Cameron's ""Aliens"" was a slam-bang roller coaster of excitement and thrills; the third one, ""Alien3"", may have suffered with plot but it did benefit from some interesting SFX and the acting of Weaver and Charles S. Dutton; and final installment, ""Alien: Resurrection"" featured interesting wordplay between characters portrayed by Weaver, Ron Perlman, and doe-eyed Wynonna Ryder, along with some really kinky erotic imagery between Weaver and the mother alien.

As far as ""Predator"" is concerned, it ranks as one ""Ah-nuld's"" best, featuring an extremely testosterone-enhanced cast being stalked by the ultimate ""big-game"" hunter.

We won't discuss the forgettable ""Predator 2""...however,...

""Alien vs. Predator"" comes close to the latter as a deplorable addition to the Alien/Predator mythology.  Not that the other films didn't have any plot holes, AVP is so illogical, filled with expendable stereotypes, cheesy effects, poorly lit scenes, occasionally inaudible dialog, and an embarrassingly short running time (100 minutes).

Even its predecessors had brilliant scores from the likes of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner, respectively, that heightened the tension in the films.

I think that another factor in the film's failure is the PG-13.  While I'm not a big fan of violence and gore, the two series' respective storylines are deserving of R-ratings and the plot development that such classifications may yield.

I'm glad to see the usually incredible Sanaa Lathan in a non-typical role for an African-American female, although I wish the actress had picked a better vehicle for which she could make her sci-fi mark.

As for Lance Henrikson, he would've done better by letting ""Bishop"" die in the third Alien.

And totally ignore the laughably awful ""commentary"" by director Anderson, Lathan, and Henrikson.  I can't believe the latter two were aware that they were being recorded!",1106870400,5,2056,5.495238095238095
1565904,3,B00005JMZK,"I'm a big fan of Predator and I like Aliens. Although the plot was ok, I think there are probably so many better ones out there. Here's some Pros and Cons I found, and, yes I know, some are VERY picky.

Pros:

1. Alien and Predator in the same frame. Need I say more?

2. Aliens look good

3. Cool Predator masks

4. New Predator weapons (Shooting wrist blades, shrunkins, ect.)

5. Even ending, neither really seemed to win

6. Predalien!

7. Elder predator looks cool

Here's the cons:

1. NO Predator would EVER ally with a human, even a teenager that knows all hope is lost if they don't. They'd use MR.Self-Destruct

2. Antarctica? I know that it may have been free of ice, but it's still COLD for a heat loving Predator

3. One alien beats two Predators in a matter of 5 minutes? I don't think so.

4. Won't the queen live after she goes down to the depths of the ocean? She survived in that pyramid for a good while.

5. Predators look a little... dare I say bad? They look kinda short and what Scar takes his metal mask off, the mandables don't close, they just kind of fold up as does the skin... it bugged me.

6. No trophies?

7. It seemed more of a ""kill all humans"" movie than Predator VS Alien

8. Alien acid-blood melts Predator armor? Why bother with it then?

Well, that's my two cents. I really just liked the movie because it had a Predator in it period and I love Predator. My suggestion? Rent it.",1106870400,,1417,4.2434456928838955
1565985,3,B00005JMZK,"I rented ""AvP"" and thought it was rather CALM. There are some gorgeous settings and spaceships as well as some great battle scenes with some truly wonderful special effects. However the blood, guts and gore that SHOULD be here, are strangely absent. An ""R"" rated version was made, but the company behind the movie (20th Century Fox) decided to go for mass appeal and tone ""AvP"" down to a merry PG-13. Seeing the actors meet their doom is/was half the fun - we'll never know until the ""Director's Cut"" is released. All previous ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" movies had been rated ""R"". The originals are now Sci-Fi classics. ""AvP"" should never reach the classic category. ""AvP"" boasts no major star power. Sanaa Lathan (who?), Raoul Bova (who?) as the main two characters and an old Lance Henriksen reprising yet a different role - no longer the droid ""Bishop"" who was ripped in half in ""Aliens"". Arnold Schwarzenegger (as ""Dutch"") and Sigourney Weaver (as ""Ripley"") where are you? Before ""AvP"" even hit the screen, the series was off and running - in comic books, toys, card games, lunch boxes and video games - so I'm assuming this movie was a must for Hollywood. Naturally, the cheesy ending is a puzzler where you think the winner is declared, but just before the end credits start rolling - something happens - making it ripe for a ""AvP: Part 2"". A few things that simply didn't work for me in this film... 1) the man-made conveyer belts in the lost civilization that the mother alien was using for all her pods (sorry, I don't believe the alien creatures were smart enough to build these); 2) Lathan's character buddying up with the Predator (oh please); and 3) there were thousands of aliens and only a handful of predators (somehow this was fair?). I give Paul Anderson credit for making this potential masterpiece, but fault him for buckling under the strong hand of 20th Century Fox. I wish Anderson was able to release the full length movie he wanted the audience to see. Here's hoping that someday we fans will get that chance. Specifics: 101 minutes long including the credits. DVD includes 2 commentaries, 3 deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, comic book info, widescreen format with 5.1 DTS beautiful surround sound. While ""AvP"" has been rendered a Sci-Fi success at the box office, I will wait for the ""Director's Cut"" (R-rated) version of the film to come to DVD before I purchase.",1106870400,,2393,4.768674698795181
1565986,3,B00005JMZK,"Alexa Woods (the beautiful Sanaa Lathan) is ice climbing when she gets a rather rude phone call. Someone wants her to put her life on hold and guide a group of explorers into an as-of-yet unknown pyramid found on a make-believe island next door to Antarctica. And that someone is billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, Aliens), of the Weyland Corporation.

The group of trepid explorers find their way to this frozen little land and discover that something has cut a hole in the ice at a 30 degree angle. And this hole leads down hundreds of yards to where the newly discovered pyramid rests.

Once Alexa, Weyland, and the other members make their way into the pyramid, a shifting maze suddenly separates the parties. And waiting for them are the Aliens, ready to impregnant them with their nasty little eggs and get those chests a-bursting.

But also, coming from outer space, are The Predators (no, Ahhnolds not coming back). The Predators have held a queen Alien in captivity within the pyramid for centuries. And what the Predators are excited about is that they can finally hunt and have their right of passage (as a Predator, you must kill off the Aliens in order to pass into the upper echelons of their order...I think). Humans are seen as a possible way out by the Aliens (if they can breed enough, they might be able to overpower the Predators). But the Predators only see humans as a means to an end. They're just chess pieces. They really just want to kick some bad-boy Alien booty.

***********************************************************************

What was good about the film?

Being a fan of the Alien quadrilogy (is that really a word?), I was happy to be reaquainted with them, even if for a short while. I love the way they look and move.

I enjoyed the first Predator film, but the second one left me wanting in a not-so-kindly way. I also thought it was kinda cool that an alien race (the Predators) would come to Earth and use it just as a hunting ground for trophies (i.e., human skulls).

The action between the Aliens and Predators was pretty nice. I liked the futuristic boomerangs that the Predators carried and I really liked seeing the hand to hand (do Aliens have hands?) combat between the two.

Where this movie fell short was in its editing.

Obviously, some genius sitting behind a marketing desk (and looking up God-only-knows what kind of statistics) decided to cut and paste this movie until it met with a PG-13 rating. WHY?! The Alien series is an R-rated series, as was Predator. Cutting out any excessive gore, violence, or other pertinent scenes is ridiculous! Listen to me, whoever you are out there in Hollyweird-Land. Don't EVER do that again! Shame on you.

I've read complaints from other reviewers about the lack of character development in this film. So what. Quit yer grippin'. It was never MEANT to be a character film. What was in there was enough to keep me interested in them. But only just.

Final words: Sequel? If so, they BETTER NOT GET A PG-13 RATING ON IT OR I'M GONNA BE P#$$ED!",1106870400,2,3059,4.740112994350283

1565993,1,B00005JMZK,"I haven't seen Alien v Predator.  I won't watch it.  I won't rent it.

When I saw the trailers prior to the theater release, I said ""renter,"" realizing that nowadays the trailers USUALLY show the best moments of the film.  Now that the movie is out for rent, I read the reviews.  Yes, some good, some horrible.  But what caught my eye was that a) Anderson directed the film, b) It's only 90 min and c) It's PG-13.

I own Mortal Combat, and as cheesy as it is, it did stick to the video game albeit bad acting, bad script, bad most things.  I watched and even bought Resident Evil.  Lame.  Really really lame.  Almost ZERO action in that movie and left me disappointed.  But hey, they left it open for a sequel right?  So, I rent Resident Evil 2 thinking ""ok, they say lots more action.""  Oh... talk about LAME!  The mutation of her friend turns out to be some undead robocop?????  She has now become some, living/undead/superbad/whatever????

So, it doesn't surprise me that Anderson has taken what could have been, and turned it into garbage.  Those two films (Resident Evil/Resident Evil 2) alone condemn Alien v Predator in my eyes.  But reading the reviews with all of the plot holes?  Predators befriending humans?  An Alien queen held captive to 'breed' alien soldiers when there are exactly ZERO humans around to breed in????

I'm not surprised that Hollywood, FOX, or any motion picture company actually produced this dribble of a movie.  It is now the norm to take good ideas or comic book stories/heroes, and make a cheap movie expecting huge profits.

Look at the movie Daredevil.  At what point did the Kingpin become black, Elektra become some lame fighter killed in her first fight, and Daredevil become some vault sleeping superhero with a different costume from the comic books?  But yet, that is the dribble put out by Hollywood.

Look at Freddy vs Jason.  Now, if you are my age, you saw the original Nightmare on Elm Street as a wee teen, scared out of your goard to turn off the light after the movie.  The original Friday the 13th was a bloodbath that made you watch as you went 'ewwwww'.  The Freddy vs Jason dribble?  Were you scared?  No.  Were you enraptured to watch the carnage?  No.  Were you conned out of money by Hollywood regardless?  Probably.

Alien v Predator was marketed to the teenagers who probably haven't seen the originals.  To them, it was probably a 'cool' movie.  To us, the older crowd that did see the originals, the movie was probably (remember, I haven't seen it) garbage.  Are we surprised?

I couldn't read Tolkien, too hard.  So I never read the Lord of the Rings trilogy to know how the movies were butchered.  To me, the movie trilogy was excellent, while Tolkien fanatics were outraged at how the movies at times butchered the books.  I did read Daredevil comics as a kid, and I was outraged at the movie Daredevil.  People who don't know the history, don't care... people who do know, do care.

Bottom line.  If you know the movie will suck, don't watch it, don't give the profit to the movie companies, and let the people who don't know (kids or those who haven't read/seen the source material) have their fun oblivious to the butchering.",1106870400,,3195,4.603202846975089

1566045,1,B00005JMZK,"So, we will have to wait for the R rated director's cut version.

I don't quite understand movie people. It used to be that their goal was to create good entertainment. Now it seems to be that their goal is to make solid profits, regardless of integrity. All of it at our expense.

Have you noticed that fewer and fewer films are R rated these days? I don't trust anybody as a matter of principle and have lost all confidence and trust in the government.

I believe the studio heads don't want troubles with the wicked hand of the FCC or the organization which dictates what we should watch. If that is the case, we are as close to censorship as we have been since the 1930's. It is a bad thing because censorship is based on hypocrisy. Nobody can impose a specific brand of morality over adults. We are not children in need of guidance.

The Alien franchise has to be R rated. Nothing else will do justice to the theme.

Any Alien movie with a PG-13 rating done in the name of profits is a sleazy reflection on our society and the integrity of companies such as FOX. By the way, now that Rupert Murdoch (the conservative super-billionaire) owns FOX, we're in for huge dosages of Pablum in the future. He also owns a lot of the media, including most of the important newspapers in the country and can guide your thinking to an extent that you would freeze if you were aware of it.

Aside from the obvious plot shortcuts and blatant lack of gore, this movie was pretty good!  The premise was fully believable and actually quite intelligent... Predators coming down to this particular site on Earth to train/test their young warriors.  Humans attracted by their greed of finding undiscovered archeological finds.  Alien mom frozen solid, held hostage and warmed up every 100 years to pump out kids who battle it out against the Preds.  As I write this, I chuckle a bit, but this is really cool!  Why do you overzealous fans complain so?

Please, look past all the plot holes and enjoy the movie for what it is.  Didn't you enjoy the 3 scenes of Preds and Aliens going at each other?  I though it was pretty amazing to finally see that.  I do wish the whole movie could have been like that, but what the hell.  I've been waiting for an AvP film since those series' of Alien vs. Predator Dark Horse comics way back in the late 80s.  And by the way... those stories weren't a whole lot developed themselves!  I actually broke them out today and thumbed through them.  They were pretty similar to this movie in many ways, and included humans in the action as a way to involve the audience more.  But i guess real fans will know about this...  right?

I did have a few minor gripes.  One was with the lovely Sanaa and the Pred getting all buddy-buddy.  That makes for weak entertainment.  Also, why would the Pred drop his wrist-bomb and run away?  That is always supposed to be the last resort, and signifies defeat.  Isn't he supposed to go to war and die for the love of the hunt? Makes the Pred look a bit soft, and inconsistent with other films.  But I do feel the Aliens were very consistent and well done (although they dropped the ball with the total lack of chest-bursting).  Its great that they didn't overuse the CGI. but did the teeth look a little big?  I thought it was Denzel Washington for a sec.

Anyway, while in no way was this film even close to being as good as Aliens (the best of all in my opinion), it did make for a fun and interesting story with plenty of excitement.

1566052,1,B00005JMZK,"I don't care if this movie was cut up by the studio or not.  It still doesn't excuse it from being ""JUST PLAIN BAD!"" How could any movie executive actually think this product was ready for distribution.  I wouldn't have paid 65 cents for this product not to mention 65 million.  The director is repeated accused of making very bad films and AVP was hideous.  Many talk of how his ""vision"" was destroyed by the evil studio.  Give me a break.  This film sucked.  And even if you put all the crap supposedly cut out back in I can't see any hope for it.

To start with the story is extremely weak and full of holes.  Lets be honest here.  Most people going to see this film are fans of the originals so how anyone could think this story line would fly is beyond belief.  Look at previous reviews and you can see dozens of plotline discrepencies.

But beyond the cheesy fanboy gripes lets talk about basic film making.  I don't care if you are a serious film buff, sci fi fan, or even casual film fan.  This movie was terrible!  I would rate this among some films like Meatballs 4 or anything beyond Police Academy 5!  The acting is atrocious.  I have seen more compelling performances from driftwood.  The female lead who I belive was in Blade (A very well done sci fi action romp) was probably the biggest joke.  She obviously had no idea what she was doing on this movie.  her lines were delivered with absolutely no emotion.  It didn't help her that the script and story was low grade dog food.  I have seen more compelling plotlines in a Charlie Brown Flag Day special.  I guess it was a good thing that all of the other characters (with lines at least) were killed off in the first half hour because it probably will save their careers.

I hate to sound so negative but I loved the Alien series.  Well Alien 4 sucked too.  predator 1 was great and 2 wasn't bad but this is just a farce.  I am sure it did but you would have a very hard time convincing me otherwise that this film made 35 dollars in the theater.  If I had half a brain I would storm the studio and demand my 16 bucks I wasted at Wal Mart for this coffee table coaster of a film.  Do me a favour and walk away.  I know the Alien/Predator is too hard for many of you Sci Fi buffs but just be strong.  Don't even be fooled by a directors cut.  It takes more than a lousy production studio to make a film this bad so adding another hour to this won't make it any better than the shlop it already is!",1106784000,4,2462,4.183368869936034

What I appreciate is that Paul Anderson is obviously a fan.  Bishop/Weylend doing the pen/knife thing between his fingers, carrying forth the fair fight Predator trait, giving a reason to the shifting pyramid (training ground) where other movies would just have it shift for effect without reason, and lots of other cool scenes.  We all believe this film got hacked cutting it by an hour getting to a short, PG 13 movie.  I really suggest anyone that likes the films give this one a shot, know going in that its PG 13 and not perfect, and look for the good not the few bads.  There are lots of cool scenes in this one and unless you are real nit picky, the director did watch out for continuity.  Much better than other sci fi disapointments like Riddick, Matrix 2/3, Catwoman, Tomb Raider, later Batman films, etc..",1106784000,,967,4.423728813559322
1566103,1,B00005JMZK,"I woke up on the January 26th(the day AVP came out) thinking ""Damn! This is the best day ever! AVP is out on DVD and Im going to pick me up a copy!""  Who could blame me?

So I make my way to the Best Buy near me.  I drive along doing warp speed, singing along with the radio because after all, this is the greatest day ever.  The only thing that was left out of this day was the sun, it was pretty cloudy, but that's a small matter.  I walk into Best Buy and I walk right past the CD section(which is unheard of) because I'm on a mission.  The magnitude of this mission is greater than that of Frodo and the Ring so I make a beeline straight to the DVD section and there it is!! AVP!!

If I could kick my own a** for thinking like that then I would. I have tried it, but I cant reach my foot around like that.  I should know better than to get my hopes up for movies like this, but I couldn't help myself. I mean, what the hell were the creators of this movie thinking when they decided to release this steaming pile of dog cr*p onto the public?  My already sickly looking wallet is $20 thinner since I bought into the hype/cr*p.

The negative points:

Predator teams up with the human chick.  What the hell is that? When the Predator didn't kill her without mercy, I immediately had to run to the bathroom while trying to choke back my own vomit so I didn't get it all over the new carpet.  On second thought, I should have just choked on it so I could be spared the memory of this movie.  What's next? What if the Predator had lived?  Would the Predator and that chick have knocked back a few rounds of Heniken at the Predator bar on the Predator ship?

The movie was not ""dark"" enough.  The originals all had a really dark aura about them.  Both creatures were really mysterious and had not second thoughts on taking out the enemy.  Nothing was out in the open.  They were always sneaking around looking for thier next victim and they would come at anytime.  They were really suspensful movies.  Well, suffice to say that all of those things were flusshed down the toliet, along with my vomit.

The Humans.  Probably the worst part of the movie.  They should have just had the Aliens and Predators fighting on some remote planet by themselves so they could get down to business and rip eachothers heads off.

The good parts.  The fight scenes between the A's and P's were really good, but they were ruined by how short they were.

Sets up for another AVP movie.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, who knows.  But if the next movie is like this one, then it will definately be another abomination.

1566104,3,B00005JMZK,"I've seen the Alien movies and really liked the first two, liked both Predator movies, read some of the comics.  I picked this DVD up and thought that the movie ran as smoothly, and as interestingly, as one of the comics.  Like in the comics, there isn't a lot of character development here, but there are some violent thrills and a halfway decent plot.

THE DVD EXTRAS: The extended version of the movie on the dvd helps you get to know the characters.  The commentary by the director and two stars is just about the single best dvd commentary I have ever heard.  The director explains what he took from the comics and some of the limitations he had.  Lance and the director seem to be real fans of the Alien series.

MY CONCLUSION:  Not exactly high art, but what would a reasonable person expect from a movie with ""VS."" in the title?  Good fun and not a disappointment.",1106784000,,872,4.433962264150943

1566106,4,B00005JMZK,"Ok, two things here, first, the good.  Supposedly the budget for this film was $65 million, if that is true, I am shocked that the picture could look this good for that relatively low amount.  When was the last time Hollywood did anything cheaper?  Maybe this could be a changing point in the $150 million film with the $35 million advertising budget--insanity.  Maybe Catwoman and others will add fuel to this idea. (yeah right)  The Bad news, what is it with these directors who think that they are bigger than the story?  Screw them.  It must have something to do with them thinking that they can't just make the movie of the book, or the comic, or whatever, they will somehow not be an ARTISTE, if they just copy the Alien vs Predator comics.  It is that, or, the other possibility is that these directors think that their ideas are actually BETTER than the material they are turning into a movie.  Isn't this where we get the ""The book is always ten times better than the movie"" saying?  I think that is what you have here.  The movie isn't as bad as the hard cores are saying, BUT, a chance was missed here to make a film that could stand with the first two Alien and first Predator movies.  Oh well, if it makes enough money, maybe we can see more, especially at $65 million. That being said, I didn't think this movie was as bad as the bad reviews said it was, I did get enjoyment from it.",1106784000,,1397,4.351351351351352
1566107,1,B00005JMZK,"...but almost. You could have given the money and production staff to almost any guy on the street and had him produce a better movie by far. (In fact, a Hollywood film company should try that sometime.)

This film opens with a Predator back in 1910 getting ready to kill a runner (with no weapon) in cold blood, violating what I thought was one of the primary codes of the hunt. Kill those who are armed and capable of defending themselves, even if there's not much chance at success. ""I know it's a crummy deal,"" drawls the gunfighter, ""but it's the only one you've got.""

Another thought: the film could have been better if they'd given it to a better director, which in this case could have been just about anyone, including the guy on the street mentioned above.

If you like pyramids, buy STARGATE or THE MUMMY series of movies (at least you can look at Patricia Valaquez in the latter). If you like space movies, get the new STAR WARS trilogy. Or, if you like everyone against everyone, wait until the sequel, which features Aliens against Predators against the Borg. And having a few drop dead gorgeous women in it wouldn't hurt.

Now there's one I'd shell out a few bucks for as long as you-know-who doesn't direct it. Sorry, Paul, you couldn't fall in the autumn!",1106784000,2,1273,4.545851528384279
1566108,2,B00005JMZK,"After reading several other reviews that state how much footage was cut from the film, I was going to be more forgiving of AVP...but I can't. There may be hundreds of excuses as to why we are stuck with this version of the finished film...but to be honest, no excuse can justify AVP as presented. What was great about ""Freddy vs. Jason"" was that the film had the appeal of both series. ""Freddy vs Jason"" felt at times like a ""Friday the 13th"" film, and at others a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film, and the result was a really fun movie that took away nothing from either of the title characters. With ""AVP"" both the Alien creature and the Predator came out looking worse for wear, with humans looking stronger than both??!! The Alien creature, who terrorized humans for at least the first 3 films of that series, are treated as though they really didn't pose much threat to humans or Predators. The killing-machine-like Predator from the original film has evolved into a sympathetic creature, that actually allies itself with it's ""cattle and prey""...humans? I think what also really hurt this movie was removing both creatures from their element. The Alien's should have remained in space, sometime in a distant future...not here on Earth in the present time. One of the key ingrediants of the Predator series, was the focus on heat and warm climate, the jungle in the first film, the heat-wave in the second. Suddenly the Predators are running around the Arctic? Too much was changed from both series backstories. Why suddenly throw in the ""every 100 years"" rule for the Predators? Why change the time-line regarding the Alien egg hatching and chest busting? It seems like this was just really lazy film making, and thrown together just to get this out for a Summer release. I mean really if this film represents the 45th script re-write...maybe they should have waited for number 46.

to see two opposing forces go at...period! For anyone else who came

films and the post made comics involving both alien and predator.

all the mentioned sources went in so many different directions.

There is so much to loath about this film.  The lack of a vaguely decent plot, the lack of any consistency with either of the other Alien or Predator films(even Predator 2 had reasonable characterisation of the Predator if nothing else).

The list of shortfalls in this thing could keep me writing for months.  The only redeeming feature is as others have stated the rather neat fights between the Aliens and the Predators.  To be honest if they'd dropped the humans altogether and made it a non speaking piece with lots of tension and good fights between the creatures, it could have been an amazing and innovative film.

But no let's go with the guy who informs us he has children and just as we think ""ah children.  I hope he doesn't....."" BAM he's dead.  In my mind he was the only character that showed even the vaguest hint of actually having a real life not just being an actor reading some lines out, even then only through the children aspect though.

1566111,2,B00005JMZK,"If I had to sum up my sentiment for this film, it would have to be: ""it could have been so much better"".
For starters, the characters are all cliched and instantly forgettable. Links to the previous films are extremely tenuous, and generally very lazy (in earlier films incubation of the alien inside humans took a day or two, here it only takes 5 minutes). This film should have been so much darker, more brutal, in line with the comic books. Instead they sold out rather, by trying to appeal to the masses.
That said there is one redeeming feature of this film - the fight scenes between the alien and the predator. They are well executed, and genuinely exciting. Shame there isn't more of them.",1106784000,,697,4.5396825396825395

I didn't care one iota about ANY of the characters and I completely HATED how the Predator toward the end shows something resembling benevolence, completely removing his aura of mercilessness. Like the people in it, I can hardly remember what the story was about. It was obviously weak. I will say the fight between the two has its moments but it doesn't come close to epic status befitting these two legendary creatures. The final seconds are okay, I guess, but it's nothing more than a cliched tease for a possible sequel (at least that's what the producers must be clamoring for). Ultimately it is a failure because I totally forgot about it soon after watching it.",1106784000,2,734,4.7421875

1566164,3,B00005JMZK,"When ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" was a massive hit in the summer of 2003, you knew that this would start the trend of ""Vs."" movies. And so it has. Here we get the icon from the long running series of ""Alien"" films that started way back in 1979 coming together with the Predator from the film series of the same name that started in 1987 and only had one other film. As far as the ""Alien"" movies go, this one isn't too bad of a new venture with the character with some nice moments, but is far from being a great representation. As far as the Predator goes, this is the best film for that character, since the 1987 original with Ah-Nold was mildly good, and the sequel in 1990 was extremely bad. The movie was written and directed by Paul Anderson, a man whose other work I have not seen. From what I uunderstand, this film is a sequel to the ""Predator"" movies, and a prequel to the ""Alien"" films. The story starts with something dastardly happening in 1904 at an Anartic whaling station. Immediatley jumping to present day, the discovery of a massive pyramid that is located way beneath the ice is located. Lance Henriksen, a nice nod to the history of the ""Alien"" series, plays Charles Bishop Wayland, who pulls together an elite group of scientists  to make the trek to Antartica and help him locate the mysterious pyramid. The scientists are made up of the usual fodder of people with different backgrounds and races, but the two stand outs are explorer Lex Woods(the lovely Sanaa Lathan), and french archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa, played by Raoul Bova. Once inside, the pyramid moves and changes every 10 minutes, and our captives soon learn that the place was a training ground for the predators to become hunters, and it's hunted were the aliens themselves. Soon three predators arrive as our captives do, which sets in motion the release of a gang of aliens from the queen mother, who has been held in some kind of crypto chamber to make new aliens so the hunt can begin. Most of the script and it's dialogue is mostly mumbo jumbo, because mainly the audience wants to see the good stuff. Unfortunatley, with it's surprising PG-13 rating, you won't be seeing the kind of good stuff you would probably want to see. There is some goo with alien guck and predator blood, but that is about as nasty as it gets. Why PG-13?. What in the world were they thinking?. The big team up between the two beasts happens about halfway in the movie, and while it is pretty good, it is also way too brief. The end battle is more running and trying to find something to stop whichever beast is left standing. Don't want to spoil it for you. So, the big grudge match really doesn't live up to the hype or deliver in the way that Freddy and Jason's showdown did. Big overture, little show. However, the movie is beautiful to look at. It is nicely shot and choregraphed, and it does look amazing. It makes the most of it's limited location, and for the most part, it works. The acting is pretty decent. Sanaa Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver, and I doubt she would try to be, but she holds her own pretty well in the role and gets the job done. It was very nice to see Lance Henriksen. He brought a sort of legitimacy to the proceedings, even if the end result does not really stand up to the best of the ""Alien"" series. I never liked the ""Predator"" movies. Always thought they were a poor man's ""Alien"". I can't give the creature the 'icon' title like the alien because I don't think the creature is. Not like the alien. It's a 90 minute popcorn/cotton candy monster fest. It does not really add upon the existing franchise of ""Alien"", but it does deliver the best of the ""Predator"" movies. It should of been R rated as well. It is not an overly great film, but is far from being the worst piece of trash ever captured on film. Talk about an overreaction. It is definitley watchable and entertaining, with some nice shots and moments here and there, but nothing more.",1106697600,,3943,4.461218836565097
1566165,2,B00005JMZK,"First off, I'll admit that the only reason I bought this movie is because it came as a two pack with ""Predator"" for a low low price.  Lets face it, when we start to mix genres, we're stumbling into ""Dracula vs Frankenstein"" territory, and it almost always ends up being cheese.  AVP, sadly, is no exception.

Most annoying: I looked at the counter on my DVD player, and it was 55 minutes into the film before an Alien actually got into a fight with a Predator.  That's far too long into the movie.

Most tired cliche':  ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"".  Well, duh!

Worst missed opportunity:  The alien/predator hybrid would have been cool if the filmakers would actually have let it grow up and waste a few people/aliens/predators.  What, do you expect us to come back and pay money for a sequel?  Fool us once...

Bad casting/characters: the only actors I recognized were Lance Hendrickson, and that guy from ""The Mummy"".  What can be said about the female lead?  She's no Sigorny Weaver is about all.  I literally didn't care if any of these characters lived or died.  I had no emotional connection to this movie whatsoever.  I only give it 2 stars because of the eye candy.

My Ending:  Female lead says to Predators, ""Hey thanks for the trophy.  And thanks for not killing me.  Since I've earned your respect and all, do you think you guys could give me a ride?  After all, I'm in the middle of the Antactic.  I don't even have a jacket anymore.""

  In 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was trying to hunt down the PREDATOR (1987)--an almost invisible creature that could camouflage itself.  It returned again in PREDATOR 2 (1990).
  Now for the first time in film history, ALIEN meets PREDATOR.  You won't see Sigourney Weaver nor Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in this film. You will see Lance Henriksen return as ""Weyland"" from ALIEN 3 (1992) and ALIEN: Resurrection (1997).

  Returning: Lance Henriksen as ""Charles Bishop Weland"".

It is October 10, 1904. In Antarctica, a man is running for his dear life in Razorback Point Whaling Station. He runs into the eatery. He hears the purr behind him and turns around, it is a Predator monster. The man is scared to death as the Predator targets the red laser on him. The Predator releases his sword claws. Just then, an Alien monster swipes his claws and kills the man.

It is now 2004. Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) is the CEO of the Weyland Company. With his assistant, Maxwell Stafford (Colin Salmon), they assemble a team of science experts to go to Antarctica. There is a heat bloom beneath Bouvetoya Island. The Predator spaceship has arrived at the very spot of the heat bloom and makes a shaft under the ice.  Our team, lead by Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan) arrive at the site on October 10, 2004. They enter the shaft and go below the icy ground. They discover in this ice cave a pyramid similar to a Mayan pyramid. But this pyramid is booby-trapped and contains moving floors and walls that move every 10 minutes. The team becomes separated and trapped from each other.  It's like a moving maze.  The Predator species are also in this pyramid to kill the team one by one. When one member touches the wrong thing, it triggers an Alien beast and releases a container of Alien eggs to the pyramid surface. Her offspring is ready to hatch.
  Our team, what is left of it, must find a way to get out of the pyramid alive and get back to the land above.  The Predators and Aliens are also fighting each other.

1566171,1,B00005JMZK,"Yeah, I know that Paul Anderson is saying that ""all the best scenes got cut out,"" but I'll believe that when I see a better version. This movie sucked, and it sucked HARD. No character development AT ALL, and some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a big studio film. A disgrace for the fans. And a note to the female lead....honey, you AIN'T Sigourney Weaver.",1106697600,,363,4.352941176470588
1566172,3,B00005JMZK,"I fully disagree with people that say this movie was not good because it was PG-13.  Even the director used this excuse saying that the studio changed his movie.  What bullsplit.  Granted there may have been less blood (although it was pretty bloody for a PG-13 film), but the movie did not fail in that aspect.  The movie was entertaining but failed in respects to actually pitting the Aliens vs Predator.  There were too few fight scenese.  The film turned out to be more focused on the human plight.",1106697600,,502,4.584269662921348
1566223,2,B00005JMZK,"Normally I don't expect a whole lot from a movie, especially a sci-fi/horror movie.  But when you see the merger of the two finest existing franchises in the genre, you'd hope that someone would pay attention to enough of the details to make the effort worthy of the creative efforts that have preceded it. If you're going to claim the title, you'd better be able to do the job.

This particular case should have been pretty easy, after all there are already several existing trade paperbacks based on this exact -versus- concept (from Dark Horse Comics); most of them read like movie scripts to begin with, and have the added bonus of being partially story-boarded to boot.  The first trade paperback even layered on a good ""evils of the corporation"" parable into the mix that mirrored the vibe in the first two alien movies.

But nope.  Let's bring in the ""creative"" and ""visionary"" force behind every lame video-game-to-movie project from the last decade, and put him in charge.  Several others have posted some pretty good critiques of the illogic and inconsistencies, my favorites are, if the temple is buried under thousands of feet of snow and pack-ice, how come the whaling settlement only has a few inches?  How would the hunt have gone forward in 1800's, or the 1700's with no-one around?  I guess ""creative"" and ""visionary"" in this context means co-opting someone else's designs and concepts, so that you can pee on them as hard as you want.

The actual fight scenes are decent, but you'd expect that in any take on this concept, so no real points awarded there.  The one or two amusing twists that you'll see (and there were exactly two) really aren't worth the effort of screening out the garbage in the rest of the movie.  Lance Hendrickson is under utilized, but hopefully got a paycheck.  The rest of the cast, and in particular the leading lady, have the charisma of a stale beer.

Rent it if you see it at all.",1106697600,,1928,4.685459940652819
1566224,3,B00005JMZK,"I love it when a mediocre sci-fi movie like AVP comes out and people who write internet reviews use thousands of words to eviscerate it as if it was filmed with the specific intent of offending them and them alone. Look, anybody who went into this movie hoping for high art can't be expected to review it competently. Now, because I myself had such low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised that this turned out to be an entertaining movie. And that is precisely what AVP is supposed to be: mindless entertainment. Paul W.S. Anderson is not and will never be considered a great writer or director, but he obviously enjoys what he does and I think that enthusiasm translates to his films. In all honesty, I think Anderson missed his true calling and should have gone into comic books because every one of his films feels like a live action comic book. Again, this isn't necessarily the end of the world so long as you watch a movie like AVP with that in mind. And this movie is indeed a comic book. It is rife with innaccurate facts and illogical propositions, but like most comics the movie is at least internally consistant in its faulty assertions. Now, some people were certainly disappointed that AVP was made in this way because it doesn't seem to make sense when held against the original Alien and Predator films. That is a very valid point, but these people forget that AVP is based on the series of stories done by Dark Horse Comics in the early 1990s. In fact, the oft mentioned Alien skull in the Predator ship in Predator 2 was only there because Dark Horse had released the first AVP comics a year or two earlier. It also bears mentioning that aside from the original AVP mini-series (which is one of the best Aliens or Predator storylines Dark Horse ever did) and the strangely fascinating yet largely incomprehensible ""Deadliest of the Species"" series written by Chris Cleremont (of X-Men fame), the bulk of the AVP titles were mediocre at best and pointless drivel at worst.  Now, having said that, it does pain me that no one decided to simply adapt story of the original AVP mini-series for the screenplay (although some elements of that story, mainly the ritual scarring of the Predators and the strange respect/friendship between the Predator and the female main character, do appear in the movie). Of course, I said the same thing about the third Alien movie as well since the first three Aliens comics mini-series' by Dark Horse were fantastic.

Anyway, this movie is not as bad as some bitter Aliens/Predator fans would have you think even though it doesn't have a shred of the raw, cinematic power that infused the first two Alien films and both Predator movies. AVP has more in common with video game and comic book inspired action movies like The Chronicles of Riddick, Underworld, The Scorpion King, Van Helsing, and Anderson's previous film, Resident Evil, than it does with the Alien and Predator movies. Don't try to convince yourself that it's the fifth Alien movie or the third Predator movie and you won't come away with such a bad taste in your mouth. AVP is a reasonably entertaining movie, hence the average 3 star rating on a scale of Blade Runner (5) to Battlefield Earth (1). It's not a ""must have"" DVD by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a fun movie that's definately worth at least a rental. Just remember to check your more refined film sensibilites at the door and you'll be just fine.",1106697600,6,3439,4.682644628099173
1566225,2,B00005JMZK,"It was the franchise slugfest fans thought would never happen except in comic book form. After years and years of failed attempts and false starts, the powers that be finally got it together. Hoping to capitalize on the surprise success of the merging of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of science fiction's most popular creatures go toe-to-toe in Alien vs. Predator with those pesky humans caught in the middle.

There's not a clich that this film doesn't like. The disposable characters are broadly sketched. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a defining trait. The film even manages to include that old chestnut where characters outrun a fireball explosion.

Fans waiting for the two alien races to start slugging it out will have to wait almost an hour until their first battle but it is pretty impressive as they toss each other around like something out of a comic book. Admittedly, the fight scenes are pretty cool in all their CGI-assisted glory but this is hardly an endorsement.

Poor Lance Henriksen is slumming it here as an egotistical businessman who provides the only human link to the other Alien films (it is hinted that he is the inspiration for the Bishop android in Aliens). He's only in maybe a quarter of the film before being quickly dispatched.

There is an audio commentary by writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They plug along gamely seemingly oblivious to the narrative mess that is this movie.

Also included is an audio commentary by visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creature effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone who likes to listen to these kinds of details will find this track informative.

There are three deleted scenes totaling two minutes and include a little bit of Predator humour that was rightly cut.

Also included are two trailers and a gallery of the comic book covers to Dark Horse's Alien vs. Predator series.

Alien vs. Predator was not worth the wait and fans of the comic book will feel cheated. The film starts off slow but once the Aliens and the Predators start pounding each other the weak script and clumsy plotting fades mercifully into the background. It's a shame because both of these alien races are ripe for countless story ideas that subsequent sequels have not been able to capitalize on effectively. All we are left with is a good looking, paint-by-numbers movie.",1106697600,3,2462,4.9156626506024095
1566226,1,B00005JMZK,"This is what the title of the movie should of been. Yes the Predator teams up with a girl to go and kill the Aliens. But this comes after the Predator kills all the other humans. But this 'hero' girl begs the Predator, ""please don't kill me"", and the Predator is like ok lets go kill some aliens. But the Predator doesn't even do that. He plants a bomb and he runs out of the pyramid with the girl. How stupid. Was this written by a 10 year old? And yes children will enjoy this film. 2 classic movies turned into a cartoon, where the Predator has feelings and doesn't want to kill this girl, but her friends no problem , they don't think twice. This movie is poorly written, there are flaws all over the place. Most 1 star revies got it right.",1106697600,3,744,4.173611111111111
1566227,5,B00005JMZK,"Loved the Film, Loved the Sound, Loved the DVD.

I got the Version from Best Buy ( Which has an extra that supposedly no place else has), the extra being a booklet of decent quality.

Anyway, the leading Lady is superb.

I chose the version which is the extended edition ( I have no idea if this an unrated or an R rated  version),  and I totally  enjoyed myself; the sound just worked brilliantly in 5.1

This is layered with Mythology, and works on so many levels. The scope for expanding the franchise works well in this adaptation of the two myths.

Lance Henrikson's performance is just great. And contrary to some people's  comments, the other characters are quite good, and very relatable; but for obvious plot reasons a few of them are 2 dimensional  characters, since they are there to bounce comments off, and only a few characters are developed  enough to be considered 3 dimensional.

Great fun, excellent  addition to the mythos.",1106697600,7,942,4.670731707317073
1566228,2,B00005JMZK,"2.5 stars. With the phenomenal success of the comic book series it was only a matter of time and slicing of red tape before this film was made.  The result is about what you'd expect.  Having read and collected a few of the comics in years past I knew that if the film was done right it could be an entertaining ride.  I was a little surprised to find myself geniunely concerned for at least half the humans caught between the monsters.  However, nothing can save the film from eventual plot failure.  Not even some elegantly brutal fights between the beasties, which were staged effectively and were easily among the brightest parts of the film.  There is actually too much plotting going on, some of which purists of the orignal films will shriek ""Blasphemy!"" when they hear it.  There are some creepy moments, at least for viewers who know what squirms within those as yet unopened eggs.  There are even some humorous scenes, as in ""nervous laughter,"" where you know the character is doomed but he doesn't.  Early on in the film, however, characters were jumping at shadows for no reason.  The creatures hadn't been introduced yet but the director thinks that the audience will somehow buy into the shock tactics anyway.  Not this audience member.  What carried me to the end of the film were the visual effects, some of which are excellent CGI creations worth a second look some day in the future.  But the story truly falls apart when one of the human characters befriends a Predator.  Right.  That's believable.  I could go into all the reasons why I think that shift in the plot is ridiculous, but other purists will understand.  When two franchises are floundering they stay afloat through a merger, combining their forces in the hope of regaining the glory days of the past.  There will never be another ""Aliens.""  There will never be another ""Predator.""  All the sequels that followed both of those landmark Sci-fi creations are evidence of diminishing returns.  Why get creative and come up with another fiend that enchants the throng when you can rehash old monsters and basically beat a dead horse?  I would expect nothing less from Hollywood.  To take a quote from the film ""L.A. Confidential"":  ""Something has to be done.  But nothing too original.  'Cause hey! this is Hollywood!""  The visual effects are good, but the plotting and toying with the respective mythologies will drive purists into a frenzy.  This film is only a rental.",1106697600,2,2449,4.780429594272077
1566229,4,B00005JMZK,"Been in development hell for a long time, this film started with a shot in Predator 2 where Danny Glover finds a trophy room with a clearly noticeable Alien head. Since then fans have been wondering what would've that battle looked like? Well this film gives the answers, well, more or less.

A satellite owned by Weyland(an ancestor to the Aliens Weyland apparently) finds a heat blume reading below an island in Antartica. With technology, they found out it originated inside a massive pyramid with remnants of Aztec, Mayan and Cambodian pyramids, suggesting it's the first pyramid ever built. Weyland sets up a team to investigate, only to find 2 races who've been warring for centuries.

What freaks you out about Alien is the claustrophia and the feeling that something was in the room you just didn't know where. Predator had a villain who was able to become invisible besides an odd optical effect and had blades and a shoulder mounted cannon.

This film is sort of in the middle of course. The film does have plot holes that a train can drive through. The predators are supposed to hunt aliens who've hatched out of hosts? So what was that predator doing in the first one killing off uninfected people? Or the fact he had to ""earn"" his cannon when he had it in the beginning. And of course there's the 100 years thing, despite the fact Arnold and Danny Glover fought them less than 10 years apart.

But taken on it's own, it's quite a fun film to watch, especially when the actual fighting starts, and it has a really suspenseful climax, but of course in typical Paul fashion, he leaves it wide open for a sequel, which if he could correct the faults of this film, it could be quite good but this film I like, but who knows how you'll take it.",1106611200,,1751,4.549206349206349
1566230,2,B00005JMZK,"1: NEVER show the Predator as a ""pal"".

(Ruins the Predator (much the same way the Terminator was ruined (anyone remember the ""thumbs up"" to the little kid on his way to meltdown)?

2: NEVER show an Alien getting it's ass kicked easily.

What's the point of the Alien at this point?

1. These are two of the most intriguing villians of modern popular fiction; the way the Aliens are treated is horrible. They are not only robbed of all dignity and mystique, they end up as the bad guy?!

2. It used to be that a great film would make people want to play games based on it. today,some films are made in order to produce games. This film is so obviously about spinning off a game, the whole thing seems like a commercial for the upcoming game.

How did the Predators end up the heroes? Didn't they get the whole mess started?

This could have been a great film if they had set it on a far off planet, made the Predators the antagonist, stirring up trouble where they shouldn't, , had no humans and no dialogue, spent time on writing it and have the Aliens win in the end.

Also, and I have to add this even if it tags me as a geek; The government had been trying to trap the Predators for 17 years prior to the start of this story. Wouldn't Weyland Corp. have caught wind of this or landed a contract by now?

Wouldn't this have been a better motivation to find this ""battleground""?!!

The people that made this (Walter Hill are you listening?) should watch the orignal Alien and realize why it worked (for very little money), the CHARACTERS were real. The world they lived in was OUR world. An awkward, messy world, but a familiar one, not a video game. Having said all that, I can with all seriousness proclaim this a far, far better film than Alien Resurrection. Now, that movie really sucked.",1106611200,4,1794,4.36036036036036
1566231,3,B00005JMZK,"This movie was better than I thought it would be. I don't think it works that it takes place in present time with Bishop being in it though. I mean think about why that is a flaw.  Alien 3 took place in the future like a 100 years after this and the Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henrikson) character was in that. He's a human that has a android made of him and that isn't even mentioned here. Here he's just a sick rich guy who wants to explore an underground Pyramid. Oh plus he doesn't even mention aliens or have knowledge of them.  So I don't think him being in it works or even makes sense. They might as well not even have called him Bishop. The Alien movies are years in the future with spaceships and the humans don't use ships in this..they weren't even invented.

  Don't get me wrong though this movie does have decent ideas and they are decently executed. The Alien vs Predator scenes are entertaining and cool but isn't really any use for humans being in the movie. The humans in this barely even put up a fight at all, where's Ripley when you need her ? Plus just like in Freddy vs Jason, you don't care about the humans eventhough they take up half the movie. You just want to see Aliens vs Predators and when you get it that's when there's some actual life in the movie. I guess the film-makers thought that Bishop being in it would attract fans of the Alien franchise. It would've worked if they actually thought it through. Plus having the director of Resident Evil do it wasn't a great idea either. Still though this is a better Alien movie than Alien Resurrection at least.

1566232,4,B00005JMZK,"In a year or two, we will see the ""real"" special edition...

Before I forget, check out the 2 extra deleted scenes of AVP on yahoo's movie page... 2 scenes that are nowhere to be found on the dvd... The dvd has only three, the movie page has 2 more...

The first scene from the yahoo page is of Lex, and Sebastian figuring out that the predators are ""teenagers"" and they've come to the pyramids to become ""men""... That's why they don't have their cannons... All part of a ritual... 2nd scene initially has Lex, and Sebastian trying to make the jump over the bridge, before Lex almost falls, and Sebas' keeps her from falling. They stare into each others eyes before another alien pops out from around the corner.... Those 2 scenes in addition to what's on the dvd itself would've of added at least 10 more minutes of story development... The alternate beginging was cool in the sense that it plays by the ""every 100 years"" the predators come down to hunt  theory.

There really isn't deleted scenes. It's more like extended scenes, and there's only a couple. The commentaries aren't horrible, but they're only available on the theatrical version.

1566297,4,B00005JMZK,"""First comes LOVE---then comes MARRIAGE---and then the Pred-Alien in a BABY carriage!!!""

Sorry, I couldn't help myself. And oddly enough, the old schoolyard taunt is strangely appropriate, as you'll soon see.

Look: I wanted to see ""Alien versus Predator"" for one reason.

I didn't want to see lovingly detailed human characters working through their conflicts and solving problems together.

I didn't want to see a banal, sappy, feminist hero (Sanaa Lathan, a usually decent actress who did what she had to do as the awful Lex) spend some quality bonding time with a Junior Predator Hunter.

All I wanted---and all I suspect you wanted---was a total interstellar smackdown between the Galaxy's two most-wanted Xenomorphs: H.R. Geiger's Alien and the 2nd-Amendment loving intergalactic hunter Predator.

In short, I wanted killing, deep space style.

Did I get it?  Yes and No.  But let's dig right into the guts of this interstellar pot-boiler. Tycoon industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (the great and nearly immortal Lance Henriksen, who is too cool for school in this outing) founder of the Weyland-Yutani corporation that figures so heavily in the ""Alien"" series, has reports of bizarre heat signals emanating from Antarctica. Being a rich, paranoid, somewhat delusional, completely obessive guy, he rounds up a team of scientists to go figure out what's going on.

What's going on? You probably know: it's the smackdown of the millennia---the intergalactic space cockroach Alien versus the gun-totin' kill-it-n-grill-it Predator. Fun times!

Right? Well, sort of.

At its best, Paul W.S. Anderson's ""Alien versus Predator"" backs off and gives us what we want. We get a total ultimate whup-a** thrashing session between an Alien drone and a uber-confident Predator. We get slicing. We get dicing. The Aliens have never looked so sleek, so deadly, so menacing. The Predators are super-sized: bigger blades, sleeker weapons, hipper masks. Give Anderson's Special Effects team kudos for this (headed up by Roland Blancaflor, who has done every single sci-fi special effects gig ever---you doubt me?---try ""Blade:Trinity"", ""Wild Wild West"", ""Planet of the Apes"" (Burton version), ""Titanic"" and so on. The rest of the special effects team have equally awesome resumes. Look, stuff looks good here.

Yes, the characters, and the characterizations, are awful. I prayed for all of them to die horribly---with the exception of project financier Charles Bishop Weyland (Henriksen), who brings a nice smoldering chunk of cool to the proceedings. Yes, Alexa is meant to be the heroine. And yes, I wanted her to die brutally, humiliatingly, and miserably from the moment I spotted her tyrannical, uber-politically correct little smirk. Barf.

Yes, Lance Henriksen is admittedly cool. Like Clint Eastwood, Henriksen is one of those actors who can charm the camera merely by sleeping. ""Alien versus Predator"" is cooller by his mere presence.

Really, though, there are three issues that will determine your enjoyment level here---and incidentally, why I'm giving this strangely subdued little flick four stars (and frankly, I just picked up the DVD of the flick if *only* as a pretty screen saver---gorgeous picture/sound tailor-made for showing off your new home entertainment rig---but otherwise not very loaded):

1) Best film representation yet of an Alien Queen Mother stomping around and showing us her `War Face'.  I'd have the Alien Queen signed up with my Squad any day of the week, Master Chief Sir!  You go girl!

2) The Antarctic ziggurat idea was nice---nicely delivered, nicely envisioned, gorgeously executed.  It was a handsome, well developed setpiece that could have served as a superb arena of death, pain, suffering, bloodshed, and carnage.

Anderson uses it for what seems like maybe 15 minutes.  And wouldn't it have been a little more fun to see the characters threatened, challenged by, crushed to bloody fragments by the shifting walls and crashing barriers?

3) The critters have never looked better.  The flick delivers four-score and seven years when Anderson just pulls back and lets them pound out their deep-space loving.  The Alien is happy, the Predator is happy, and we're happy.  Like the light saber duel in that first Star Wars prequel---that's what we're here for!  Would it really have been so bad to give us more?

I'm an Aliens & Predator franchise fanatic: bear that in mind. Half the joy of the flick (apart from the signature critters going mano a mano in a pre-Colombian labyrinth) comes from seeing my two beloved franchises brought into a bloodthirsty close encounter: from the brutally practical Aliens-style green computer block lettering in the opening credits shunted out by the Predator blood-red tactical lettering, to the surprise visitor at the end of the flick.  If you came to see Beast on Beast, then you'll go home happy: otherwise avoid.

And remember: per official Company directive, this movie is totally expendable---and so are you.",1106611200,,4987,5.268015170670038
1566298,2,B00005JMZK,"I saw the film and initially thought that it was pretty good. However repeated viewings have eroded any good opinions that I'd had about it. I mean PG-13? How? Why? That's kind of like getting Disney to remake ""The Evil Dead"" with blue blood instead of red (like the option that lightweights can use while playing a Resident Evil or a Silent Hill game.)So I reckon the only reason I EVER liked it was a) I got the DVD for free and b) novelty value at finally seeing the two species get to duke it out. Though sadly, this novelty wears off pretty fast.

  I could possibly write a lengthly thesis as to why I came around to the idea that this film is pants, but I'm lazy and can't be bothered. Suffice to say, that if you want good sci-fi/horror entertainment, steer well clear of this and watch the first Predator and the first two Alien films instead (as far as I'm concerned Fox didn't even make ""Resurrection"" so I won't even bother to mention it... DAMN I JUST DID!!) Anyone who doesn't agree with me is obviously mentally sick and must be shot.... (Err, did I say that bit out loud??) Sorry (cough, I'll rephrase that last bit,) anyone who doesn't agree with me just doesn't appreciate what makes a good movie and is likely a slave to the studio hype machine anyway,(which is probably why Fox still allow George Lucas to direct ""Star Wars"" films, ah but that's another story/rant entirely.)",1106611200,2,1395,4.484251968503937
1566299,4,B00005JMZK,"I was very hesitant to watch this movie because the critics mostly hated it.  To my surprise, it was much better than I thought it would be. I actually liked it a lot!  It pitted the Alien versus the Predator and had an plausible explanation for it. (A team of scientists go to Antartica to discover a lost Aztec city buried underneath, to discover that it is the battleground for the Alien species versus the Predator species). The special effects were really good and the acting was fine. (Sanaa Lathan's character Alexa Woods becomes the equivalent for Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in this prequel to the Alien series). What I liked most of all was this DVD included an extended version (not shown in theatres) as well as the theatrical version.

Some of the reviewers thought the PG-13 rating butchered the movie.  It didn't have that effect for me.  I appreciated the PG-13 rating because it cut down on the unnecessary profanity and gore -- you can make a really good sci-fi movie without either of them.  I'm sure there are some plot flaws in the movie but I didn't notice them that much in the movie theatre.  I am a fan of the Alien series and thought this movie was way better than Alien 3.  It is on par with Alien Resurrection (which I liked).  Aliens is still the best, followed by Alien (the original).  I felt Paul Anderson did a commendable job.  I look forward to the Alien legacy to follow.

This DVD includes great special features such as:
a) Full length audio commentary by Paul Anderson, Lance Henricksen, and Sanaa Lathan, and commentary by special effects supervisor John Bruno.
b) Deleted scenes
c) Making of featurette (AVP Promo)
d) Alternative ending not shown in theatres
e) Miscellaneous art work stuff

There is very little plot, very little acting, and you pretty much know what is coming the entire movie. However, when the Predators and the Aliens throw down, it makes the entire movie worth watching. It reminded me of all the old horror classics like Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, the Godizilla movies, and every Ben Affleck movie that has ever come out. The movie doesn't try to be a sequel/prequel to the Predator or Alien franchise, doesn't really try to explain how the Predators started hunting the Aliens, where the Aliens come from (which has never been explained), and it ends leaving the movie wide open for a sequel. It isn't going to when any Oscars, but it is a fun movie to watch if you like big monsters fighting each other while stupid humans, who never should have went inside the temple in the first place, run away and act as cannon fodder.

The movie's over emphasis of the acidity of the aliens' blood was beyond annoying.  The movie was tolerable until about 45 minutes into it when the plot took a turn for the worst.  Honestly, I don't think that fans of either series were really looking forward to seeing the predators befriend any humans.  Also, the scene at the end was strangely reminiscent of a Jurassic Park movie, I could just as easily have pictured a T-rex chasing the woman through a field of bones.

I walked into the theater the day it was released with my expectations held high.  I'd been wanting to see this film for almost a year and it had finally come out!  Well, I was a little bit disappointed, but I still liked it.

This film is so much better than Freddy vs Jason in soooo many ways.  A better plot, a logical reason that the Aliens and Predators were fighting, and much better effects.  The flaws were small, but noticable.  For instance, the chestbusters do NOT come out as quickly as they did in the original Alien films and some of the CGI was fake looking.  And it was rated PG13.  There better be an unrated version of this released, because a PG13 rating for a movie like this is crap.  The original 4 Aliens and 2 Predators were rated R.  It was still enjoyable though.

1566355,4,B00005JMZK,"The first two Alien films rank among my favourite sci-fi/horror films of all time. The original Predator was among Arnie's best films when he was at the height of his career. The subsequent sequels to both franchises unfortunately have only been so so.

I was intrigued, however, by the concept of combining both and the fact that the director was Paul Anderson who had directed the entertaining Event Horizon. On the flip side I had the not so great sequels as an indication of what to expect, if things did not turn out so well.....

Well I am pleased to report that the end result was worth the wait and the viewing.

The storyline revolves around the discovery of a huge pyramid below the ice in the Antarctic. The discovery is made by a huge corporation which specialises in genetics, and in a neat tie in with Aliens and Alien 3, the billionaire CEO is played by none other than Lance Hendriksen who plays the android Bishop in those particular films. He puts together an exploration team headed by Sanaa Lathan who plays a Lara Croft character turned environmental warrior. Delightful cameos include the actor who played Spud in Trainspotting. Hendriksen's character accompanies the team into the pyramid.

Unfortunately for the explorers the pyramid turns out to be an almighty game of death chamber for young Predators who have to go through a terrifying initiation of having to hunt down and kill a traditional foe - the Aliens.

Before long both sets of aliens are trying to kill each other and the unfortunate humans in between, find themselves getting slaughtered by both sides as the mayhem continues.

It falls to Sanaa Lathan's character to lead the survivors out of a pyramid which not only has both sets of very nasty aliens but also has the disconcerting habit of changing its interior dimensions every 10 mins or so. This attempt to flee the pyramid is so fast moving and suspenseful that at times it is almost like watching Aliens (I kid you not). The build up to that moment ie. the discovery and initial exploration of the pyramid is entertaining too.

The ending is a little contrived but does not detract significantly from the film itself.

Give it a go, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. It is not as good as the first two Alien movies or the original Predator but it is comfortably in front of the other sequels in terms of entertainment.",1106006400,3,2374,4.703614457831326
1566356,4,B00005JMZK,"Perhaps one of the most high-profile, if not the most successful movie of 2004, was the sci-fi thriller `Alien vs. Predator'. The film, starring Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen, sought to double the thrills and suspenseful horror of both the Alien and Predator series of movies by bringing the two together in a monumental battle. With the majority of the action occurring inside a pyramid discovered underneath the Antarctic ice, this movie is essentially a prequel (as discussed in one of the commentaries) to the 1986 movie `Aliens' (which was itself a sequel to 1979's `Alien.' In fact, director Paul Anderson admits during his audio commentary that the James Cameron sci-fi thriller is his ""default"" movie that he is inclined to watch again (and again) whenever he is bored.

Taking place in the present day (well Oct. 2004), Henriksen plays multi-billionaire Charles Weyland (and founder of the company which rules pretty much everything in the earlier futuristic movies) whose satellites have spotted what appears to be either an Aztec or Cambodian (opinions are split) pyramid below the Antarctic. Weyland assembles a team to investigate and upon arrival at the site, the group finds itself caught in the middle of a centuries-old battle between the Predators (from the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie) and their age-old quarry Aliens.

Adapted from stories published by Dark Horse Comics, Anderson is able to stay true to the original movies while still setting his story in the present day. In fact, the actual reason and history behind the struggle between the two alien species surprised this reviewer. Henriksen, of course, has the standout performance in this picture, but Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver (star of the `Alien' franchise). This movie really shines in the special effects - which surprisingly rely more on traditional methods (as explored in a second audio commentary by the effects team) than the present-day reliance on computer generated imagery (CGI).

In addition to the two commentaries, (the lighter Anderson, Lathan and Henriksen one and the second more technical special effects one) we also have a surprisingly involving half-hour documentary on the production of the feature. Separated into chapters, the featurette covers such areas as the development of the story (apparently numerous writers took a stab at the concept, but Anderson ""hit it out of the park"" on his first try), casting and special effects work (mostly miniatures and animatronics).

The DVD also includes an extended edition of the feature that includes, among other things, an entire prologue set on the whaling station that is found abandoned in the theatrical cut. Presented separately from this are three ""deleted scenes"" which are actually more accurately extended scenes. There are also some rather lame Fox promos, including one for a `King of the Hill'-type cartoon named ""American Dad"" and the new Jennifer Garner movie `Elektra"" as well as some examples of the artwork from the Dark Horse AVP comics.

Generally of interest to the sci-fi crowd, if you enjoyed either of the two franchises on which this takes its inspiration then this should prove an enjoyable ride.",1105660800,3,3184,5.2109375

One Predator lets a facehugger attack him and lays an alien inside of a Predator ""which is at the end"".The Aliens on the other hand kicks the dogg crap out of the Predators.

It is an action-packed Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider type of adventure combining significant elements of horror.

The acting is average and the choice for lead actress was poor at best. Though she is a Halle Berry type (which is definitely a bonus) this film does not seem to be her thing, especially when she does not present her ""Halle Berry qualities."" Consequently she is not convincing in her role.  Moreover, the opening scenes with her receiving the phone call while climbing the mountain were weak.

1566360,4,B00005JMZK,"Another comic-book film that has been a long-time in the making, AvP, (Aliens Versus Predator,) was originally seeking funding in the late nineties, but it wasn't until just recently that it was finally given the full-on go ahead by Fox. Fortunately for die-hard fans of both the Alien series and two Predator films, it does not disappoint, leading box-office sales on its first day, and only dropping down to fourth during the following few weeks. Though AvP has caught a lot of flack from numerous reviewers, primarily for its unusual and historically impossible plot, it stands as a success for both viewers and Fox itself. AvP is fast-paced, sometimes unreasonably so, and gory, (two aspects which have attracted a lot of bad press,) making it more of a `fun' film as opposed to a serious pillar in either series. The special effects and soundtrack are excellent, and both the Alien and predator creatures have become more fluid and deadly than ever, but the main point where the film falls apart is historical accuracy. The whole concept which is pushed through the film, of ancient civilizations collaborating to build a sort of ""war temple"" for their predator ""gods"" in the middle of Antarctica is both unwieldy and insulting, working from outlandish theories about the south pole that have been long-since proven false.

 At the very least, it's worth the price of admission. Alien afficionados will likely be disappointed by the incredible growth rate of the creatures themselves, but there is an amazing amount of other visual ""goodies"" that are sure to delight. Be warned, however; the storyline is less-than-average and the cast is relatively green, (excluding Lance Henriksen and the female lead, Sanaa Lathan,) making it a wild ride that doesn't amount to much more than a fun and enjoyable (if you don't mind a little adrenaline,) addition to both the science fiction and Horror markets.",1104278400,,1902,5.034920634920635

1566362,3,B00005JMZK,"I bought a Region 3 DVD of Aliens Vs. Predator, released two weeks ago here in SouthEast Asia.  At first, I was skeptical, given all the negative reviews I've heard from critics and some friends. Still, being a Predator and Alien fan, I have to buy it.

Maybe because I lowered my expectations that's why I enjoyed it. Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who I have negative opinions on after seeing his abominable Resident Evil) provides a logical connection between the Aliens and the Predators. It even has an Indiana Jones-like feel with some historical apocrypha on the origins of three ancient civilizations.

In gist, it is about a group of explorers led by Lance Henriksen, which sets forth to uncover an ancient temple in Antarctica (Henriksen, who plays the android Bishop in the Aliens series, is trumpeted by a magazine as the father of modern robotics in AVP, making it one of the numerous references of the two franchises). Unknown to them, it is a training ground visited by Predator initiates every 100 years. The site is below a whaling station abandoned in 1904, and the movie is set on 2004 and that's when the fun begins.

Those who have read the Aliens vs. Predator comics will have no problem predicting what will happen. In fact, even the ending is inspired by the first Dark Horse AVP series. I have no problems with that since seeing the two aliens duke it out on screen is well worth the admission. But that lies the problem. While the film gives an excellent backstory, tying up loose ends on the two species' connection, it fails somewhat in the storytelling department. It lacks the tension of the Ahnuld Predator movie, the visceral gore of James Cameron's Aliens or the moodiness of Fincher's Alien3,  Admittedly, you cannot have monumental twists with such franchises but the entertainment value of the Predator (the first one) and Aliens (all four) movie is the way the directors told the story. The way they paced, edited and shot the film makes the somewhat predictable outcomes irrelevant. In Paul Anderson's version, it seems to be there were lots of scenes cut, making the film too short and the fight scenes truncated. I hope there's a director's cut or unrated version sometime soon because if this is it, it is enjoyable yet lacking.

Still, it is a must in every Aliens/Predator fans' library, because of the story, not the execution.",1103414400,,2369,4.794117647058823
1566363,4,B00005JMZK,"If you think 'AVP' can scare you like the first 'Alien' film, you are utterly mistaken.  Like 'Frankenstein Meets a Wolfman' or films with such titles, 'AVP' needs our clear understanding that this is a popcorn film for the fans of these series.  It's pure entertainment -- derivative but still thrilling actions with cardboard characters -- and surprisingly, it is fairly enjoyable as such.

The story is not bad, considering the time gaps between the two series.  In the year of 2004 (which means, this year!) a team of academics led by an eccentric millionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, reminding us of his famous role)  try to examine the archeologic findings.  Unfortunately, they find themselves trapped in the pyramid-like constructions, where the fierce battles between Aliens and Predators are going to happen.

The logics behind the apparently contrived situations look  forced at first sight, ignoring some parts of the films made in the past, but I think still the plot itself is pretty reasonable if not original.  The bad things about it is, in fact, that the derivative set-pieces are not scary or exciting as the writers think, and even the film's final scene (that is a clear sign of another chapter coming) is not really a surprise, being telegraphed from 40 minutes away.

But I didn't hate the film, simply because Paul WS Anderson, whose past track records include not-so-great sci-fi films like 'Soldier''Mortal Kombat''Event Horizon' and 'Resident Evil' keeps the things going anyway, with good production designs and many references to the previous Alien and Predator  films in the past (see the way Henriksen uses a pen before his PC, tapping on the desk with it, for example).  And the film's unexpected turn concerning one Predator with the heroine Sanaa Lathan is a good idea.

'AVP' is more like a novelty, so you cannot expect the same credible characters seen in James Cameron's sensational 'Aliens.'  No little girl, no suggested undertone, no Vasquez.  Still, the actions themselves are not bad, actors doing good jobs, CGIs fine (not perfect, though).",1103328000,,2100,5.099415204678363

I've played the games, read the comics, read the books and seen all the movies.  The AvP movie was by far the worst representation of these two franchises to ever grace (disgrace?) the cinema.  First of all a PG13 rating?  What the f@&% is that all about?  The movie might as well have been PG.  Hell, why stop there?  Make it G so my 2 year old daughter can go see it.  Paul W.S. Anderson can have the Aliens and Predators playing pattycake while the humans form a circle around them and play duck, duck, goose.  (Now, I'm just being silly)  Seriously though, what's the point of bringing together the two baddest Sci fi characters in history if you're not going to represent them the way they should be?  Why even put humans in the movie to begin with?  I mean, okay, you could use them as fodder for the aliens to reproduce with.  Other than that you really don't need human interaction when it comes to these two franchises.  Aliens and Predators can do a good job of kicking each others asses without human interference.  Apparently, Mr. Anderson thought humans were integral to the plot.  In my opinion, he should have followed the plotlines of the PC games or even the books.  Instead of the humans being scientists, they should've been Colonial Marines.  Also, place the setting of the movie in the future on some other planet.  Not present day Earth.  The fight scenes were dizzying and obscure for the most part with a few exceptions.  Aliens gestate way too quickly.  2 minutes and they're a chestburster already?  Whatever.  This was a total disappointment in almost every sense of the word.  A different director, a different backdrop and an ""R"" rating would have made this film so much more.

There were so many things wrong with it. Although I often diasagree with major film critics for the most part, I agreed with basically every single one in this case because they seemed to produce only horrible reviews for AvP.

As do the Predator films, the edge-of-your-seat atmosphere created in Predator I was superb. There lies the biggest problem with AvP, its a tame film.

Lets face it AvP is never going to win over the hearts of everyone, people who like dramas, or period dramas etc will not be a no. 1 fan of anything with an alien in it. The most I could give an alien film is 4 stars, there is never much acting and the plot is normally weak. But the main ingredient of all Alien and Predator films, ferocity, is missing. And it shows.

So I went in with moderate expectations so I would not let myself down should the movie not meet the expectations of the actual AVP legend... and I left the theatre feeling cheated.  Spoilers ahead!

The movie started out decent enough; recruitment of some talented scientists, archeologists etc.  However, the characters seemed kinda hollow.  The archeologist... no real background information other than the cool pepsi bottle cap necklace.  The owner of the big corporation... ironically played by the guy who did Bishop in Aliens and Aliens III, he was probably the most emphasized character; trying to make one big adventure before his heart fails... wow.

The Scottish dude was kinda cool, always taking pictures for his kids... but they killed him off just as quickly.  There was really no time to get to know the characters and get an emotional response for them.  It was a quick, ""here are your characters, now watch them die off quickly.""  So when people were literally being picked off left and right, I was like, ""Oh well, bummer.""

Another problem I had with AVP was how quick the Predators got picked off and how powerful the Aliens were.  Now, in Aliens the Marines (And I was furious that there were no Colonial Marines, just dudes with overpowered hand-cannons) were able to take out a number of Aliens whereas one Alien killed like two Predators... and impregnated the last one... which killed him in the end.  That's a real imbalance to how it should've been.

And another gripe I had was the incredibly lame sequence of the explorer chick taking out an Alien and fighting alongside the last Predator.  It was really lame, granted Predators show respect for those they deem worthy, however, it just seemed too wierd that just 10 minutes prior, the chick was complaining about people carrying firearms... and now she fights like a warrior alongside the predator... hmmm..

The ending was predictable, Predator presents gifts and the impregnated one's chest burst.  Saw it coming 30 minutes prior (which is half the movie).

All-in-all, the movie was too short, predictable, inconsistant with the previos Alien and Predator movies, lack of devlepement in all areas and just plain lame.  The only upside was you find out where the Predators came from... and unless you read the books, it'll come as a surprise.  I already read the AVP books and what not so I knew where they came from so I felt as though nothing was changed.  I would stray away from this one if you're a gamer or AVP fan.

I swear, after seeing a preview, I was drooling to see a lot of aliens and a lot of predators in an all-out slashfest ending with a big explosion. That is actually a tiny snippet of the movie. Anyway, I came in and to my surprise, the theatre was EMPTY!!!!! That's always a sign the movie is bad, but I needed something to kill my Saturday, so I watched it. Turns out, it's not what it's hyped up to be; it's short, derivative, and very stupid. Scenes include:

* Predators carrying a hurt predator on a stretcher (I was laughing so hard!)

* A Predator and our very bad actor lady sledding down a hill

* And many more!

So, when the credits started, I just said ""WHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa????? THIS IS THE MOVIE I WAITED FOR SO LONG??????????????????????? THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DON'T GET IT WHAT HAPPENED OH MY GOD THIS IS LAME WHY THE STRETCHER WHY THE CRAPPY ACTORS WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?????!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?""

...but the fight scenes were good. So, in conclusion, this is a nice way to kill a weekend or maybe (I said MAYBE) rent. I guess I had expectations a little high, but this is still a movie that could have been much, much more than a mere franchise crossover. Still, it's a kinda cool -mindless- summer movie gorefest (I put hyphens over ""mindless"" to accentuate it), the special effects aren't bad, and hey, maybe you'll like it!

1566501,5,B00005JMZK,"Having read all the bad reviews I was reluctant to watch the movie in the theaters. Anyway, I went to watch the movie hoping that at least it would be mediocre and not as bad as all the reviews said (maybe the reviewers didn't get any money from Fox this time).

  The movie was great. I don't know what people wanted to see. There was actions scenes, great fights, suspence and a great atmosphere that made the movie out of this world! This was something different from all the movies I have seen.

 Positive:

-Predator -->get to know how their kind works and despite the fact that they kill people too the viewer kinda enjoys it!! I liked the predator character.

  -Alien--> I also liked the alien character even though there wasn't much more to tell!!

  -I liked the story. It certainly could have been better but I was never bored.

 Negatives:

  The duration of the film was a bit short. They could use another 10-15 minutes to make the film longer and add to the plot-storyline. That would make the film perfect.

  The human characters indeed as most people say weren't that much. In my opinion even though the main female character was ok, they should use a male instead of a greater movie status. For example someone like Bruce Willis (someone like him, he is already way to hard to die but is great!), or another well known actor would really make the difference in the movie. No need to play in the whole movie or talk 30 mins through out the course. Just a well known presence could add more to the movie and become better attached to the character.

  Of course there are some minor problems throughout the movie having to do with the dialogue and the shooting of the director (runing together with the predator side by side and shooting as they run forward was not very original and brought some laughs) but these again are minor problems.

 The whole atmosphere and action scenes where great and I don't understand how an alien or predator fan could not like this movie. It's not perfect but the least you can say is that it is decent and worth the watch.",1101168000,2,2074,4.481283422459893

The action is drawn from the game.  The books also help with the story.  AvP 2 will rock the Predalien from AvP2 the game is shown.  Now the predator in the story was supposed to be a god to humans and the alien was supposed to be just a breeder to kill...  the predator scenes and action kick arse big time, I didn't realise that the movie was PG-13 while I watched it.

Every person (including myself) who saw this movie went into it with that decieving mindset; coming out six bucks in the hole, and none too satisfied.

1566562,2,B00005JMZK,"Two of Fox's major franchises are combined in Alien vs. Predator.  A film that has been rumored ever since fans saw an Alien skull in the Predator's ship at the end of Predator 2, AVP fails to live up to the standards set by its two individual franchises.  While some of this could be blamed on the intense anticipation that has built up around the project for the past 10 years, some of it must rightly be placed on the fact that the movie was of poor quality.

First, look at the director.  The predator and alien franchises have been helmed by directors such as James Cameron, Ridley Scott, and John McTiernan.  Besides the Alien or Predator films, these directors have done Terminator, Die Hard, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down and many more.  The director of this film:  Paul W.S. Anderson, who has directed such classics as Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil (great games to be sure, but lousy films).  From the start, this film is already at a disadvantage compared to its predecessors.  It's hard enough to live up to the legacy that is the Alien and Predator films; it's even harder when you lack the talent to even try.

The biggest problem with the film is that it feels rushed.  At only 88 minutes, the movie is over before a strong cast or story can be achieved.  The story involves a team of scientists who find a temple under the ice of the antarctic through satellite imagery.  There, they discover that within the temple is a chamber home to an Alien queen who lays eggs that impregnate humans used as sacrifices.  Those aliens are in turn hunted by a small group of predators who must defeat the aliens as a rite of passage.

In terms of the speed of the film, I had two major problems.  First, the team of scientists is relatively large, which I thought would allow for both species to have plenty of victims.  However, most (but not all) of the humans are killed off through various manners in one 5 minute span.  The purpose of this seemed to be to narrow the cast down to just a few key players, but since the characters are never properly developed, this ploy just does not work out.  Instead, it serves only to bring about the end of the film quicker.  The same can be said of the flashback that is used to explain the presence of the predators and aliens.  It's a quick flashback that is quickly explained by the pictographs found on a wall in the pyramid.  It felt more like Anderson thought this was an annoyance that had to be done rather than an integral part of the film.

There has been outcry over the ""friendliness"" of one of the predators in the film.  I understood why this was necessary (it would have been difficult to have the humans be the only characters who had any interaction outside of violence) but it just did not come off right in this film.  Instead it seemed more childish than anything else.

There are some good aspects however.  The special effects are good, especially because it does not rely solely on digital effects for the creatures.  The sets, specifically the pyramid itself, are great and create an excellent atmosphere.

This is not a horrible film, but it is only average.  What makes it worse is that it's the combination of two successful franchises, both of which contain films better than this one.  Die hard fans might enjoy this film nonetheless, but others should stay away.",1098921600,2,3336,4.5376884422110555

Here it is folks, you buy this dvd and you are the ones to blame for worthless and cheap films that Hollywood puts out. Those who want to talk about this being a version of the history of the Alien and Predator series should be sent back to movie school. This film is both a waste of time and an insult to the original series and the fans of both.

Flaws:

-Aliens when hatched from humans walk on two legs

-Predators are not teddy bears

-GORE and violence, real violence are the main idea of these films, along with great story, not in AVP

-Cutscene like filming, they were either running all the time or there was a fight scene that i couldn't hardly follow. Filming of these scenes lately have been way to fast and dizzy

-Too fast of a story, too fast development leading to nothing, no fun no NOTHING!

-Took place on Earth, who cares about Earth, placing the series at the present was a way to totally mess up the series beginnings

-Stick to more back story, develop from what has been written already (i.e. novels and comics)

-DON'T LET A LAME DIRECTOR WHO LIES ABOUT NO CONTROL MAKE A MOVIE LIKE THIS

-ALIENS ""R"" PREDATOR ""R"" AVP ""PG-13"" I SEE NO CONNECTION HERE DO YOU

-PREDATORS ARE NOT CUTE AND UNDERSTANDING

I'm sure i could write more here but I'll let you decide, but don't buy this dvd, and don't expect a director's cut, this movie is a waste of time and a waste of 15 years that I waited for a great film.

1566566,3,B00005JMZK,"Okay, the film wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. But really, though, I don't know what all the hate is about.

The story has a wealthy billionaire's satellites spotting a gargantuan pyramid buried 2,000 feet under the Antarctic ice. So the rich man, Charles Weyland ""BISHOP"", leads a group of scientists into the pyramid to check the place out. Once they are inside they find themselves in the middle of a war that is being fought between two warring alien races. The vicious, hostile Xenomorphs, referred to as the 'Aliens', and the equally vicious, but altogether honourable hunting race of the 'Predators'.

Make way for mayhem aplenty and 'ONE' good fight scene.

AVP: Alien vs. Predator is the latest effort by a Hollywood studio to blend two very popular film franchises together. Pitting the Aliens from the Alien franchise, spanning four films and the Predators from the Predator franchise, spanning two films, is an idea that has been around for about fourteen years (first starting in the comic world) give or take a year or two. And after the success of summer 2003's far superior 'Freddy vs. Jason' Twentieth Century Fox decided to try their luck.

The film takes it's time to get going. Paul W. S. Anderson (writer and director) chose the slow, horror-esque build up of the original 'Alien' over the action adventure feeling of 'Aliens'. It's not until about thirty minutes into the film when we see our first glimpse of one of the Predators (and even then, it's just a hand). And the Aliens don't show their handsome faces until about forty-five minutes in. No joke! But when they do show up, things do get pretty exciting. The Predators are just BRUTAL!

The acting is okay. But I won't really say much about that. I mean, like Freddy vs. Jason, from any film with VS. in the title, you don't really look for award winning performances.

Visually the film was great. The Aliens have never looked better, (they were mostly all CGI) and the Predators have never looked uglier. Also, at the end when the lead Predator takes its mask off, it has a wider range of facial expressions. Obviously this is due to far superior animatronics. I mean, when it's fighting the Alien Queen (who was the highlight of the film, she looked great!), you can actually see the worry and determination in its face. Very good, indeed.
Also, I think a compliment must be paid to the 'flash back' sequence. I don't know about you but I just came out in cold sweats seeing three Predators taking on thousands of Aliens. Fantastic!

The only real bad thing about this film (a lot of people believe that the whole of the film is bad, but I think that a lot of people have been very unfair) is that there was only one proper fight scene. What the #@#+!!! You heard me, only one.
  Fair enough the ONE fight scene was good, and also it had quite a good running time, but really, though, for a film entitled Alien vs. Predator you really expect more than one. I don't really include the fight at the end between the Alien Queen, the last Predator and the last human because I wanted fights with just the two of the creatures.

The director, Paul W. S. Anderson is, in my opinion, greatly under-rated. I think that his films before have been okay. 'Mortal Kombat' was, admittedly, a bit iffy. But you can still have fun with it. 'Resident Evil' was quite good, I thought. It was quite chilling. 'Event Horizon' was just weird.
Also, when you watch AVP, you can tell that Anderson had FOX breathing down his neck all the time. It was THEM, not HIM, who made the film less gory than all the other Alien and Predator movies.

This brings me onto my next point. I know that in America it was rated PG-13, but over here (I'm from the UK) it was rated 15, which I guess would fall into America's R category.
I don't know about this. The film did seem quite brutal in bits, especially the bit when the Predators were slicing and dicing those men on the surface. And when the black man got caught in the netting; quite a nasty sequence. You see, our equivalent to your PG-13 would be a 12 rating, but I think the film would have been too strong for a 12.

And last but not least, the ending. Don't worry, I'm going to be cruel and spoil it for you (like a lot of inconsiderate people on here have done). All I will say is that it was the most predictable ending I have ever seen. The good thing about it, though, was that it finally gave us a glimpse at something which we have been waiting for so long to see.
I mean, it had the words 'please insert sequel here' written all over it. Hopefully, if FOX do make a sequel, and judging by the box office results in America alone they will, we'll see 'IT' in full swing.

So overall this was a film that had a weak script, appalling dialogue but some good action moments and solid FX throughout. Put your brain on hold and you might find yourself having a good time.",1098662400,,4885,4.469135802469136

A man who is forever blaming studio interference for the poor quality of his films. What on earth Fox, Walter Hill and John Davis were thinking in hiring this hack I'm not sure I want to know. Trust me, no matter how naive and simple your film-going pleasures are, you will walk away from AVP forever jaded and cynical.

Both franchises are best examples of their genre.

Alien-Utterly faultless
Aliens-Breathtaking hardcore sci-fi action
Predator-Just so brilliant words fail to describe it
Predator 2-Underrated sequel that plays like a story taken directly from a 1950 Tales from the Crypt comic-book.
Alien 3-Notorious failure but far superior to AVP.
Alien Resurrection-Very strange but intriguing weirdo sequel with some wonderfully unique touches.

And now...

AVP: Alien vs Predator-Watered down, childish, repetitive, boring, completely flat, soulless and castrated.

Paul Anderson simply has no idea where the heart of either franchises is. He directs the film with arrogance and over-confidence. Undeniable proof of this is obvious in the scene where Sebastian says 'It's all beginning to make sense now.'

I'm sorry, the sense must have been lost and me and the rest of the audience.

Having seen AVP in the cinema twice now I must stress to you that the film does NOT hold up in repeat viewings. After being surprised at how 'not too bad' it was the first time, the rotten dialogue, endless exposition, slow set-up and lack of actual Alien vs Predator fighting damn this film to hell. Much like the main faults of last years Freddy vs Jason, though at least that film was a hard R-rated movie and not a kids movie.

For a crossover franchise that has existed for over 14 years throughout many different forms of media, the AVP movie should have been an epic directed by someone with talent. Instead Anderson craps all over the source material and directs the worst film of his toilet dwelling career. AVP plays like a bunch of cut-scenes from the video games and totally devoid of any originality. In one particular scene he blatantly and obviously rips off a narrative from HP Lovecraft's At The Mountains Of Madness. The nerve!

There are plot holes all over the place and massive gaps in logic. Like why does the acid blood conveniently only corrode weapons the Predator doesn't really need? And why oh why do they hunt in Antarctica? The are drawn to earth areas of heat and conflict.

Just as horror movies are desperate to come up with new, better reasons to make the use of cell phones not available to the dying one-by-one characters, AVP uses the most asinine reason to isolate the cast so no one can help.

Get your head around this monstrosity...the Predators hunt Aliens in a pyramid 2000 feet below the ice on a remote island in Antarctica.

WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

Of course they do. And the next RoboCop movie is set in a volcano below Vietnam. Honestly, it is the most ridiculous story ever concocted. How dare they release this gibberish upon an audience who, for a long time, deserve better.

Despite the utterly moronic plot and pathetic characters, the film does do a decent job of tying both creatures together. Such as the Predator's fondness for triangles and multiples of ten. The Weyland-Yutani corporation's initial interest in the species. And the presence of Lance Henriksen, as Bishop's creator and the only cast member with credibility.

The Predators get very little screen time (much of the film's meager 101 minute running time-14 minutes of credits-is devoted to wandering around dark corridors...how astonishingly new) and when they do show up they are total wimps. Though the main one is a bit harder, he's a bit too humanized at the end. His facial expressions are very, very cool however.

One cannot help how much better this film could have been. Even with the awful Anderson at the helm, if Alan Silvestri's scores and themes from the Predator movies had been kept then the tame action scenes would have soared. As it is, Harald Kloser's score to the movie is generic and unengaging. Yet another missed opportunity.",1098489600,12,4230,4.878661087866109

I have been a fan of both the Aliens and Predator franchises since I was 10 and I have to say that this alien vs. predator movie has been long overdue.",1098403200,,522,4.282828282828283
1566641,3,B00005JMZK,AVP was a ok movie. I was going to see The Borne Suprmecy but  was 15 minutes late and couldn't see it so I saw AVP instead. The beging was boring. The middle was ok. There was a lot of action. And the ending was just stupid. In the end the pedator gets hurt and a person is looking at it like they love it. I thought it was a corny ending. Pretator was a  lot betterthan this. When it comes out on DVD and video rent it If you liked Predator or Alien rent it before you buy it. The whole movie is about a temple thing under ground that has aliens and peditors having a war in it. Some people find it and go on a expedition to it and the expedition goes wrong beacouse of the aliens and predators. The people on the expedition gets split up and everyone dies exept one person.

Now I know some 10 year old kids probably loved this movie, great. Anybody who's over the age of 10-11 should steer clear of this train wreck and move on.

Anderson (the director) should never be allowed to work in Hollywood again, he took two of the coolest creatures in movie history (the Alien and Predator) and made one of the worst movies in history about them. How could things go so wrong? It should have been so easy, but then again we've never seen anything good come from Anderson so why I expected more here is beyond me.

There is no other reason. Once you can accept that, and stop hoping for an Oscar Award effort, you might actually find that you can sit back and enjoy the film for what it is - a surprisingly enjoyable foray into the mindless world of Sci-fi violence.

That said, I am happy to say I went into this with no expectations whatsoever, and came away immensely satisfied. The minor efforts to smoothly link the two stories - Predator and Alien - were admirable. Taking into consideration the end of Predator 2, in which the Predator handed Danny Glover an ancient Earth weapon, signifying that they had been on Earth before, it wasn't that much of a stretch to imagine that they had been prevalent on the Earth at the dawn of civilisation.

And the idea that they bred Aliens as training tools for their best warriors was intriguing, and not so improbable. And, it gave a whole new meaning to the phrase, 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'. ie, one Predator, one human and a whoooole lot of Aliens.....

On a personal note, it was a nice touch to have the familiar face of Lance Henrikson in the film.

Also, one would think that the combining of these two modern cinema behemoths would be of epic proportions.  The movie is slightly over 90 minutes with only a few of each of the creatures running around. The movie plays more like a SCI-FI CHANNEL original movie than a major motion picture release (and will end up on that cable channel anyway). What the producers should have done to make this worthwhile, and hopefully someone will read and think of this review when the sequel of A vs P is in pre-production.

If the director really is a fan of the two franchises (Aliens & Predator) at the very least he could of used the story line that Capcom used when they made ""Alien Verus predator"" for the Arcades because they managed to get it RIGHT and the game was made 10 years ago in 1994! If anyone who is reading this review was fortunate enough to play the Capcom arcade game of ""Aliens Versus Predator"" you'll probably agree.

Capcom and various other videogame makers could get it right how on earth did Paul W.S. Anderson manage to turn AVP into a god awful film. Ever heard of the saying ""A bad teacher always blame his pupils"" well that's exactly what Paul W.S.

Here's what it is; a cheesy sci-fi actioneer with some great fx and a heap of bad dialouge that caters to fans of both franchises that are just tuning in to see some battling space nasties.  That's it.  AVP is not a good movie.  It is satisfying in some strange manor, though, and would fair better if so much meat was not cut off.  Some disspelling; the acting isn't bad at all, it's the character development and lack of plot that suspends believable players.  The fight scenes with the Aliens and Predators are cool.  They don't resemble wrestling matches, but would benefit from some more limber Predators (they are, after all, giant stuntmen in heavy suits).  This movie is great entertainment on a Saturday afternoon when you don't want to use your brain and like to witness some halfway decent extraterrestrial carnage.

After a Herculean effort, he reaches the gun and fires right as the facehugger is about to attach itself.  He yells with triumph...but then half a dozen other eggs open up and the camera pans away as we hear gunshots and see muzzle flashes.

I highlight this scene because it was the only thing done well in the entire movie.  Aside from this scene, the movie was pure mercenary filth, an attempt to make a quick buck. Most people critisize the screenplay in this type of movie, which of course was awful, but the direction and special effects, and acting were lousy too.  This was just a bad, bad movie.

Slow-motion is used in virtually every action scene, a human teams up with a Predator (who, incidentally, taught us how to build pyramids and used us as ""cattle"" to breed Aliens, their ultimate prey), and a former whaling village isn't found near a shore.  Continuity errors abound, the fight-scenes are chaotic and clumsily-handled, and characters are able to discipher thousands of years of buried history in five minutes so that the audience can have some idea of why Aliens and Predators are dueling in Antartica (and incidentally, we learned in the first movie that the Predator is drawn to heat).  The Predators are not fluidly moving creatures but husky 250 pound football players thumping along, and their once-frightening facial features have been reduced to money-saving masks that look like they were bought from a CVS.

Oh, and just in case you figured you'd have a bet with your friends on who'll win, don't bother, the movie decides its better, even in a movie called ""Alien Vs. Predator"", to have no winner in the battle.  Pathetic.  1.5/10",1096761600,6,1854,4.759375

1566697,2,B00005JMZK,"Those jonesing for some spectacularly realized one-on-one fight sequences involving Aliens and Predators will be bitterly disappointed, given that this movie ultimately delivers only about 90 seconds of that.  Call me crazy, but I kind of thought that was the whole point of this concept - bring together the two most vicious, sophisticated and entertaining monsters in cinema history and lock them in a room.  Anderson does give us that, kind of.  The ""room"" is a suitably creepy pyramid deep beneath Antarctica, and of course it contains the requisite clutch of human prey to be sequentially disemboweled and decapitated at a steadily increasing rate.  So why is it so boring?  Mainly because there's too much focus on the humans, and not enough on the bad guys we've all come out to see.  It doesn't help that the unifying story - the flimsy excuse for bringing everyone together - involves a once-in-a-hundred-years showdown and ritual human sacrifices.  Hose off the decorative archaeology and what it comes down to is this: once a century, the Aliens and Predators get together for the equivalent of a round of paintball in a purpose built fun park.  It gets worse: one of the humans - a tough-as-nails tomboy, of course - starts earning a Predator's respect.  You can guess how it goes from there: soaring music and big explosions as they reach out across the inter-species divide.  Whatever.  It's mildly diverting, but nothing you haven't seen before: a shame, when something striking and new - the realization of an irresistible ""what if..."" scenario - was precisely what this movie promised.  Ten years in development, you would've thought they could do better than this.  I would have settled for a 90-minute fight-fest in deep space pitting Aliens against Predators in situations where they needed all their disparate skills to survive.  No humans.  No dialogue.

to answer someones statement about AVP ruining predator 1 and 2 (there WAS a 3 that was as bad as AVP), in predator 1 and 2 im pretty sure they were renegade predators that shouldnt have been there at the time. at the end of 2 i think the many predator chiefs or whatever were there to capture the 1 renegade themselves perhaps. i don't know, i heard that somewhere a long time ago.

but point of the matter is that AVP was HORRIBLE!!!!! and don't feign like it was good because people will go pay $20 for the DVD when it comes out.... HORRIBLE!",1096243200,2,1048,4.235
1566700,2,B00005JMZK,"Well, waddya know. John Travolta, you can now breath a sigh of relief because ""Alien Vs Predator"" has risen to dethrone ""Battlefield Earth"" as the most ridiculous science-fiction-fightfest of the modern era. Between the mooncrater sized plot holes (the humans discerning thousands of years of history from a few lines of hieroglyphics was my favorite) to deconstructing six movies' worth of characterization in barely 90 minutes, this scriptless wonder was generating unintended laughs from the audience I was sharing this misery with. The actual fight scenes were so Bugs Bunny/Road Runner goofy that snickers were breaking out on a regular basis. You gotta love it when the Predator starts swinging an Alien around by the tail, like it was a loose cat.

Oh, by the way, this movie has more wardrobe malfunctions than a superbowl half-time extravaganza. The Predators have cloaks of invisibility that suddenly seem to give out during the last fifteen minutes. Same for their ""I can see the little thing inside you"" goggles. And if I was trapped alone in the night of an Antarctic winter, I'd really think I'd look like I was really COLD if I was dressed in a friggin' T-SHIRT! But I guess anything logical is not to be expected when the pyramid shifts every ten minutes - except near the end when the clock must have busted and allowed the passages to just move at random. Believe it or not THE SETS ARE THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!! (Thus saving this review from dropping to one star.)Even the sets are cribbed from somewhere else.

1566743,3,B00005JMZK,"Aliens vs Predators in an underground, ancient city- what more could you want? But alas, it's not as entertaining as it sounds.

I will give the movie this much- the fight scenes were exciting and very cool. But what's up with only three predators coming down only to beat like what- a million of those aliens including a huge alien that is the mother of them all? How fair is this? And in the first battle scene, two are killed by one alien! Then the last predator has to deal with the rest. I find this very unbalanced. I mean it would have been a lot more better if there were more predators. And also, the plot was to me a bit unfair as well to the aliens. They bascially say predators are the good guys regardless of what Schwarzenegger proved in his films with them earlier on in years, and aliens are the only menance. Now I was expecting them to both be the bad guys as they were in their solo careers, I believe that would have made it more better too. I don't see the predators being good guys that's all. Neither look like creatures I could trust, and the bond between the female protagonist and the predator at the end was a bit silly.

To me, the movie just was not the cool masterpiece I expected it to be. When Freddy vs. Jason came out, you didn't see them neccessarily pointing one of them out as the good guy and that was the point- neither were good, and although Freddy was put in a darker light, Jason still filled his quota as the evil being he was. That movie was satisfying. But AVP did not add up as FVJ did. I expected both sides to be bad assess and only the aliens filled their quota. Predators were supposed to be just as bad and yet they turned out to be, well...not so bad.

I wasn't too surprised when I found out the director though, Paul W.S. Anderson. I hated Resident Evil part one, and he directed it. If I knew he directed this movie, I probably would have never went to see it. Paul does not have a good reputation with directing in my opinion.

1566746,3,B00005JMZK,"Hello!  The movie title speaks for itself as it invokes the Alien and Predator names.  In Alien, we have a widely regarded sci-fi classic, and in Predator, a cult classic.  However, the movie released in theatres is not what the title suggest- no there is no huge mass Alien-Predator smackdown.  The movie's action scenes were cut, at few points quite noticeable, removing the gore and blood csenes to preserve Fox's in tention to reach the movie to kids, especially those who play the video games.

  The plot was more of lore than a intricate pattern that evolves with the film- rather the Predator and Aliens are blood enemies, and the they fight each other to prove who is worthy of beinga Predator.

  The characters are, as one account calls them, ""cannon fodder""- as they seem to feed the action scenes by being snatched and seized from all around them.  Lance Henriksen does a fine turn as Mr. Weyland, founder of the famous Weyland-Yutani corporation that originally sent the spaceship from the the first Alien movie to the disabled spaceship on LV-426.

  The lead character was a politaclly correct Ripley, no offense to any African-American readers, forgive me, but the new Ripley fell  slightly short of developing the iron constitution that held Ripley together.  However, what Sanaaa Lathan falls short of compared to Sigourney Weaver is made up by the former's beauty and emotional reaction to circumstances.  Ms. Lathan does a sterling job when she was alone and scared after her last friend was killed, and then confronted by the Predator- very nicely and believably done!!!  Sadly, after that part, the movie's quickly built plot is cast aside as the pure action takes control.  The battle with the alien queen was all right, but I thought too dramatic.  The relationship between Lathan and her friend the Predator, is sort of strange.  At the end, when she was crying over him as he was dieing, I thought they were going to kiss!!  Thank God they didn't- I would have left after that!!!

They went to LV BECAUSE what happened to the vessel in Alien and the story that Ripley told to the Company board, so Burke got the idea to send some idiots to check if the ""Relic or Derelic"" (if you are a fan you know what is) was there.

Third, Some people complain about the setting..maybe they don't know jack about the game.  This movie relies a little on the game.

The fight with the queen reminded me of aliens, could have been more original and the end scene with the dead predator belongs in every B-grade movie made and says hi Im coming back for a sequel all over it.

I like Lance Hendrickson but he was wasted in this movie except for making a continuity sequence for the movies. The other actors were just cannon fodder and to show you how bad the aliens and predators were.",1094515200,2,774,4.468085106382978

This movie is an insult to Cinema, hahahaha, I say we will send you back to England make some movies about that pothetic loyal family (now that's really scary), to start,this movie can't scare a baby, I laughed through out themovie andso most of thepeopleohh yeahh to be ownest, one person was really scared, it turned out to be a toddler who was scared, because it was dark in the theater.  can you imagine predators and humans working together toward common good, were  they on drugs.  oh yeah let's help humans to kill this big alien mother...  so now we can become a real predators, so all along predators did not now what they up against. to describe the story and characters i could say, they should of put computer generated characters and this would at least make it interesting, those men in predators suits, i'm surprised predators didn't say anything in english, i can't vbelieve Anderson didn't think of it, yeah i know to busy working on the story, i heard he was writting a script for 10 years, go back to school, i can write something like that in 1 day, i mean if i want to get a c for a class.

Ok I saw this movie on the opening weekend and I watched Alien Ressurection last night and yes it is R but,anyway it was very violent and brutal I mean, it's violence was very intense and grotesque, i don't like that Alien movie. Who cares about the PG-13 rating of AVP it was still pretty violent but not as violent as Alien ressurection. I Have seen Aliens and Alien Ressurection unedited but Alien & Alien 3 I have not.

A bunch of citics have given this film bad or neutral reviews and after reading them, I wonder if they even watched the movie.  What's not to like?  Great special effects, hand to hand, shooting, explosions, and much more.  There is an actual story line involving a different earth history along the lines of Chariots of the gods.  Each of the characters is given just enough explination and history to know who they are.  The director did not take an extra hour or more and delve into who cries in bed or even wets it for that matter, who eats wheaties, or who cheated on their last taxes....Good, Great, save it for the ""Oscar"" wannabes.  He even borrowed from a directing great, Alfred Hitchcock, by showing just enough action and blood etc. without going overboard and thereby making it even more intense because you get to use your imagination.  Why do you think Texas chainsaw masscre is so intense, its not the gore, but the lack of gore and what you see in your mind's eye.  That being said, I would've liked to see more fight scene's than there were

not more guts, but more fight scenes.  They've whetted my appetite for the next one.  Without spoiling any of the movie, all questions and doubts raised by the naysayers are explained in the movie....all you have to do is watch it.  Possible spoiler alert.... the line ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is in the movie and has been ridiculed by some as a terrible made up corny line, but those critics should study history a little more intently and they would be silenced.  To sum it up, great action, great fight scenes, great special effects, decent story, decent acting equals a 5 star sci fi action movie.",1094083200,,1779,4.570977917981073
1566806,3,B00005JMZK,"I liked this movie. BUT if you're a fan of Alien, Predator and Aliens vs. Predator it definitely lacked. Having read some(all?) OF THE ALIENS VS. PREDATOR novels and many, if not all of the Aliens novels, I went into this film with some expectations that the writers might take some of the elements from those books and indeed they did. The human female warrior, accepted by the Predators, the ""hive/pyramid"" here on earth, the concept of the aliens escaping and destroying the earth are all from the books. The idea that the Predators were responsible for the building of pyramids by various cultures thousands of years ago and thus being worshipped as gods was an interesting twist. But there the quality goes down hill. I'm used to things happening fast in these movies ,but this one was over before you had a chance to become acclimated to the constantly reconfiguring pyramid! The battle scenes were ok, but there needed to be a lot more. I mean, having the predators almost wiped out well before the end? Come on! In the books, the predators, aliens and humans have all met on several occasions. The predators have a word for humans which means 'soft meat' but they do respect the intellect of humans (I guess Arnold and Danny Glover showed 'em we can be formidable opponents). They (predators) refer to aliens as the 'hard meat' no doubt due to their insect-like outer shell and natural weapons, but regard their intelligence as little more than dogs (albeit very dangerous dogs). So one would expect the predators to be very skilled at figthing the aliens and maybe see some specialized weapons, but before you know it, 2 of 3 predators are taken down by, not a pack of aliens, but one or two! Surely an alien is no match for a fully armed predator. I found myself thinking, ""good for the aliens"". In the end the predator triumphs with the help of a human of all things. Too short and swift. My main complaint was that the plot needed a little more time to develop. That's what made the original movies great. This one was put together fast and it shows. It's fun but it's not a keeper. Go for the 'R' rating next time and get Cameron or Scott to direct. Oh, and Lance Henricksen as a human? A little continuity guys. Please?",1094083200,2,2233,4.571072319201995
1566807,4,B00005JMZK,"I have to admit that the movie delivered more than what I had expected. The special effects were excellent with minimal use of CGI (I think....) and the storyline does have connections with the original alien quadrilogy as well as the predator saga. Expecially the Weiland corporation and it's owner were keys to tie this film to the alien ones. There were a few shortcomings however; The acting of the italian archeologist was poor, the change in interior ambiance of the predator ship compared to the one seen in Predator2 and the fact that some of their stabbing weapons melted, when in contact with the alien blood, but some of them didn't were puzzling. Also the use of the alien skull as a shield would have been impossible because the acid would have burned the girl's arm. Otherwise I did enjoy this movie and it was intense and bloody enough to keep me tense. Overall: GOOD.",1093996800,,883,4.666666666666667

THE PLOT

There is no plot, its about Aliens fighting Predators.

This is my guilty pleasure, I don't care what happens to the main characters or what happens to the film in the box office. This is almost a great film. The Queen Of The Aliens chases the main hero in the film, and I fell out of my seat laughing, God this a good film.",1093824000,4,648,4.126984126984127

Centering on an elite team of experts, selected by a CEO trying to leave life with a major humanitarian accomplishment, they go to an island off of Antarctica.  Once there they discover a temple, which appears to be the foundation of all ancient temples.  Of course, the conflict is that there is a war going on in the Temple and the humans are just ""guests.""  I thought this was an ok movie because it was just plain entertaining.  On the other hand, this movie develops slowly, which is usually bad for an action movie.  Also, do not put your hopes on the cast, because well, some of them are short lived, obviously.  Other than that, the movie is just a good combination of two okay series, so four stars overall.",1093824000,,864,4.3625
1566864,3,B00005JMZK,"""AVP,"" as the cool kids call it, isn't that bad of a movie.  It isn't great either.  I'm a fan of the original ""Predator"" movies, so that's why I went to see this flick.  ""Alien"" and its successors never really grabbed my attention and the books that this movie is supposed to be based on can't be found at my home.

Now that you know my background on this thing, let's get to the film, which was actually pretty good, if you go in expecting PG-13 fights and gore.  I knew from the get-go that there wouldn't be any major violence, language or sex, but the action that does appear on the screen is very good.  The special effects were flawless, and both creatures looked very believable.  In this aspect, the movie was excellent.

The movie starts off with a really good plotline about an ancient pyramid found 2000' below the ice in Antarctica.  A crew, funded and joined by the king of solid, but average sci-fi, Lance Henriksen, investigates what's going on down there only to find the place to be a battleground for our title heroes.  The film then goes into a really, really good explanation of how these two critters came to arms against each other.  From there, the story goes into standard, but above-average action mode with plenty of violence for the adults but not so much that it turns away the always important thirteen to seventeen year-old demographic.  Before it's all over, the film actually gives you reason to pull for one of the bad boys, and it might even tug at your heart, but just a little.

All in all, this film could have been really good if it was allowed to be an R-rated film full of really violent action.  Let's be honest, folks didn't come to see the Alien and Predator fight it out in close-ups and dim lighting.  They came wanting to see an all-out brawl between two of the sci-fi genre's biggest muscles.  I can understand why the boys at Fox wanted to keep this movie teen-friendly, since they probably make up the bulk of the audience who reads the comic that this movie is based on, but fans of the original films may be a little disappointed if they come in expecting too much.  Perhaps a sequel will come out(the ending almost guarantees one) that will be geared more towards an adult audience.

In closing, this isn't too bad, just don't expect folks to be skinned alive or Sigourney Weaver to pop up.  I feel like I didn't waste my money on this one, and I'll probably get the DVD when it comes out.  I recommend it with reservations to big fans of either franchise.  This will probably go over better with the general audience, since they don't have anything to poke or prod the film with.",1093824000,,2633,4.46652719665272

I was also disappointed that the alien's didn't get more screen time but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I give it 3 out of 5 stars for at least some good action and I would seriously recommend renting this movie or wait till the director's cut comes out on DVD...other than that its a waste of money.",1093564800,2,583,4.407407407407407

If you like the Alien and Predator films,you will like this one! See this while you still have a chance!!!!",1093564800,,420,4.6891891891891895
1566867,1,B00005JMZK,"Ok honestly, how many people that have seen any of the ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" movies would not be curious to see what would happen if The Alien and Predator met eachother in a face-off?  That kind of curiosity is what drove me to watch ""Alien vs. Predator.""  And now, I'm sorry that it did.

The movie is about a man named Weyland whose satelite finds a temple 2000 feet underground in Antartica.  Why he has a satelite over Antartica is a mystery to me.  Anyways, he gets a group of archeologists and explorers to go into this mysterious temple that just recently appeared on radar two days ago and, oh yeah, already has a freakin' tunnel leading to the entrance.  The temple is actually the home of the Predators, who created the creature we've come to know as ""The Alien"" so that they could fight them every 100 hundred years thousands of years ago.  And guess what?  Its a hundred when the explorers go down there.  Another interesting point, the information that I just gave was figured out by the explorers who A) Do not know anything about any of the creatures and B) Figured out the background history of the Predators by seeing that the humans of the time worshiped them, from pictures in the temple.  Well, the Predators go into the temple and fight the Aliens that are in there and, well, they fight eachother.  Thats about it.

First of all, the story is ridiculous.  I hated how the humans seemed to know everything about these creatures.  The humans found out how to be the Predator's friend and actually fight along side of them in battles.  ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" is used throughout the movie.  They figure out that the Predator doesn't want to hurt them, but only take back one of their weapons that one of the humans had in the temple.  Oh really?  That explains why the Predators slayed all of the humans that were outside of the temple, since they had the weapon and all.  Also, the ending is supposed to explain how the Aliens get into space, which is makes no sense at all.

Overall this movie was quite terrible, which is really a big disappointment for two movie fanchises that are as popular as ""Alien"" and ""Predator.""  I would definately recommend that you do not see this movie and tell anyone else that you know not to see it and save their money.",1093478400,,2289,4.480676328502415
1566868,4,B00005JMZK,"Let me just start off by saying that I really liked this movie. I find all the heat that this movie is taking to be ridiculous. This movie has stayed true to quite a lot of the lore from both film series. I should know, I love both series (except for Alien 3, which wasn't a total flop, but somehow managed to piss me off). I remember being 5 in 1991 and seeing the Aliens Special Edition, right there becoming a fan of a series that both scared and fascinated me at the same time. Same for Predator.

  I'll start by adressing the people who actually thought that the movie was going to and should have been directly out of the comics. I FART IN YOUR GENERAL DIRECTION! YOU'RE MOTHER WAS A HAMSTER! LEAVE NOW OR I WILL BE FORCED TO TAUNT YOU A SECOND TIME! (Gee, I wonder where I heard that! heh heh) Now that I have gotten that out of the way, anyone who is left should know that for one thing, this film was cut down. It was always meant to be an R rated movie, but fox wanted as much money as possible. That, my friends, is what DVD's are for. Paul Anderson already said that there will be an R-rated directors cut on DVD that will clear things up. Not that the PG-13 version was all that bad though. Now I shall attack all the flames of this movie. WHEEEEEE, FIRE!

  One thing that I have heard that has pissed me off was people refering to the end scene as funny. IT MOST CERTAINLY WAS NOT! I distinctly remember myself saying ""OH S#*!"" when I saw the face hugger latch on to the Predator. Anyone who knows their stuff about the Aliens knows that the only reason that the Aliens look the same throughout the Alien movies is because all of the hosts generally tended to be human, with the exception of the one in Alien 3. The Chestbursters seem to take in some of the DNA of its host, henceforth the reason we have or regular human aliens, our dog aliens and now the Pred-alien.

  Another thing that irritated me was people griping about the Predator basically becoming a good guy near the end. I even heard someone compare it to Jason being a ""Good guy"" In Freddy vs. Jason. First off, Jason was never a good guy at any point in that movie. He had no problems with hacking people up in between his bouts with Freddy. It was a matter of the lesser of two evils when the teens took his side and hoped he'd win. Now back to the movie at hand. The Predator is not Jason. They are not particularly evil to begin with. They are a race of hunters and its pretty obvious that we humans are worthy of the hunt, otherwise the Predators wouldn't bother with us. These things are hunters, they have honor and pride. Its also pretty obvious to the predator by that point that he's outnumbered and to lose would mean the Aliens would eventually get out and that would be all she wrote. Besides, the woman proved herself and saved him. Now the Predators are fierce and have high tech weaponry, but they aren't fools, why do you think they carry around a big bomb? They aren't invincible and they know it, so it wasn't all that weird when he let that woman tag along (I can't remember her name right now).

  Another thing I have heard is people griping about the one hundred years thing and how it would basically make the existance of the other two encounters not make sense. Uhh hello! Did you not catch the part about them coming back every hundred years to hunt the Aliens as a right of passage? That doesn't mean that a Predator isn't going to show up to hunt humans for trophies, does it? Not that I know of. Hunting for trophies and the rite of passage hunt are different things people.

  I also have a problem with people saying that the Aliens didn't seem to have their prized intelligence in this movie. I don't know about anyone else, but I didn't see any stupidity from them in this movie. There wasn't much in the setting to showcase their intelligence like in the Alien movies. The temple was specifically set up for the hunt. I don't care how intelligent the Aliens are, they don't have radar, at least that I know of. Add that to the fact that the temple changes every 10 minutes and you can be sure the Aliens don't have full reign of the place, cutting off their usual ability to set traps like in the Alien movies, which was a showcase of their intelligence.

  Now, about the main female character being no Ripley, yeah, I'll give them that. You can't really replace Ripley because she was the main character in all the Alien movies and we all grew an attachment to her through the storytelling. But no critic can possibly tell me that Ripley could have fit into what was basically a Predator 2 sequel and an Alien prequel as far as the timeline goes without using some cliched time travel crap that I'm sure no one wants to see. So yeah, Lex (I remembered her name) is no Ripley, but having a new female heroine isn't all that surprising. Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley was basically one of the first real female hero's in movies and it was kind of refreshing to see Paul Anderson keep up that tradition instead of having a male hero.

  One last thing I am tired of hearing is about Paul Andersons directing abilities. It is almost like critics are out to just bury this guy just because he has some creativity and Isn't just cashing in on a series popularity. Mortal Kombat was a very good movie, despite not having a Scorpion and Sub-Zero face-off, and I thought that Resident Evil was a great movie. I was relieved that he didn't do what all the stupid fanboy's (yes, I hate fanboys with a passion and wish I could use a little more colorful language to describe them, but I will try to be as polite as I can) wanted and just film the same story as the original game. If he had I wouldn't have went to see it. The best part of the games is the interactivity in its story, watching the same story without the interaction would get boring quickly. I am beginning to become a fan of Andersons work and I look forward to his next project.

  Any other nitpicks about the movie, like the faster gestation period, don't need an explanation. The upcoming DVD Directors Cut will take care of that. I chalk up all the bad reviews to a bunch of idiotic fanboys who were actually expecting the Dark Horse Comics storyline and don't want to look past the fact that what they are bitching about is easily explainable, people who didn't really care for it because they aren't fans of the series and those annoying moviegoers who don't want much backstory at all and want the action NOW. I must admit that I was worried when I heard it was going to be PG-13 instead of R because I thought that a lot of the good stuff would be left on the cutting room floor. Im sure quite a bit of the good stuff was, but there was a lot of the lore of both franchises and the movie surprised me. I can't wait for the R-rated DVD release and you can bet I will be first in line to get it. I'm hoping the directors cut turns out to be even better than what I have found to be an already great movie, just like Jim Cameron's Special Edition of Aliens thirteen years ago.

  There is no mistaking that no cut will be as great as Jim Cameron's contribution to the Alien series, but I strongly advise fans and moviegoers to go see this movie. It is better than anyone seems to want to give it credit for and as a fan of the both franchises I highly recommend it. Remember to never listen to critics, they never seem to have anything good to say about a movie and always seem to want to compare it to Citizen Kane.

1566917,4,B00005JMZK,"Alien vs. Predator (Paul W. S. Anderson, 2004)

I've been a fan of the Alien movies for almost twenty-five years, and a fan of the Predator movies for almost fifteen. (Yes, I even liked Predator 2 and Alien 3.) So honestly, I walked into this movie expecting to loathe it, even though Paul W. S. Anderson was responsible for Resident Evil, one of the few videogames-made-movies worth watching.

But first, a few words on one of the strangest theatergoing experiences I have ever had. I was in Akron, OH, this weekend, and went to see the movie while my wife was in class. So I was somewhat out of my usual sphere of cinemas, and went instead to the closest place to where we were, a Regal Cinemas outpost just off Rt. 77 in Fairlawn, OH.

While the floor wasn't littered with trash or anything, ""dirty"" was the word that kept coming to mind. There was just something inexpressibly grimy about the place that kept me from feeling comfortable at all. This could well be because I'm used to the insanely-well-kept Cinemark in Valley View, which is pretty much the king of theaters, but there you go. Add to that the insane matinee price (I've paid less than the matinee price at Regal for evening shows at some theaters within the past year) and the insane drink price-forget popcorn (six bucks a tub!)--and I was set to hate Alien vs. predator even more, because it gypped me out of eight bucks more than it should have had I gone to see it at Cinemark (and let's not forget Cinemark has free refills on popcorn, making back-to-back moviegoing such a pleasant experience).

Then I got into the theater about twenty minutes early, and instead of the usual projection of still-frame trivia and the like, I walked in on a short promo piece about both the upcoming special-edition DVD of Resident Evil and the upcoming film Resident Evil: Apocalypse. It was followed up (with, of course, commercials in between everything) with short features about other stuff, like the new animated NBC series Father of the Pride. This, folks, is what we should be doing with our time twenty minutes before a movie, not trying to unscramble such difficult-to-fathom-when-scrambled names as Ali Larter. Sheesh. Cinemark, most everything you do right, but this is one place where dingy, dark Regal outscores you big-time.

(Also, a trailer for Paparazzi, the first picture from the mighty Icon since The Passion of the Christ, and my, my, does it look fine.)

But now. Aliens. Predators. A slew of good reviews from critics and a cadre of fans over at IMDB who have trashed it right into the ground. Basically, they're saying all the things I thought I would. But I'm not going to.

Sanaa Lathan (Love and Basketball, Life) is Lex, basically a Sherpa guide who happens to come from somewhere in America. She, along with a bunch of other folks, is approached by Maxwell Stafford (Resident Evil's Colin Salmon), a rather twee representative of Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the ancestor, if you will, of the AP in Aliens and the Weyland character in Alien 3 (both also played by Henriksen). One of Weyland's satellites has discovered some kind of heat signature over a small remote island off the coast of Antartica; judging from the walls, it's a pyramid, two thousand feet below the ice. Everyone is rather excited; this could be a major archaeological find, and Weyland and co. want to be the first ones there (over Lex's objections, since no one in the party is trained for this sort of thing). But you can probably tell by the title of the movie that archaeology is not what will be going on in this movie. And as soon as you see the pyramid, you will know the what, the who, and the when (as in, during the next hour and change of film). The how and the why will be explained to you, don't worry.

Anderson here does a fine job of keeping with the parallel structures of both franchises (you don't actually see a monster for a while, letting tension build), except there's not much tension to build. Anderson has made the mistake that both Richard Donner and John McTiernan avoided: he's simply got too many characters running around to give us enough empathy with them in the space of forty-five minutes or so before the action begins. A possible budding romance between Lex and the team's chemical engineer, Graeme (Julien Donkey-Boy's Ewen Bremner) wanders off the face of the movie, never to be seen again; an opening shot featuring an archaeologist (Under the Tuscan Sun's Raoul Bova) ends up being a shaggy-dog joke; some of the characters are never introduced to us at all before the team is assembled, so we know very little about them except, if you're paying very close attention, their names (and in one case, what a character does; the rest seem to be there to provide predators with appetizers before they move on to the main course of Raw Scientist). And despite Anderson's beliefs as stated in the AvP special shown on Fox last week, Sanaa Lathan's character ain't no Ripley, by any stretch of the imagination. Lathan is a fine actress, but she has massive boots to fill, and I'm not sure anyone could have done it.

So, all that said, why was I so awed by the spectacle that was Alien vs. Predator? Simple: the special effects.

I'm not a huge fan of special effects. I'm the guy who didn't even notice bullet-time in The Matrix, and had no idea what people were talking about until I saw The Art of War (on video!). But every once in a while, a movie pops up with special effects so brilliant, and so well-integrated into the scenes, that you cannot help but sit there, jaw agape, at how well they fit everything together. One scene in particular is so well-rendered that I actually wished Elias Merhige would have directed this picture, because he would have lingered on it longer.

Of course, the movie does go over the top into SFX cheese territory a few times (the bullet-time facehuggers provoked a laugh from the audience, as I figured they would after seeing them in the TV promo special), but for the most part, Amalgamated Design, Inc., earned whatever they got paid for this film, and whatever it was, it wasn't enough.

Even though I went into this movie with high hopes, I realized about halfway through (while I was formulating that too-many-characters bit in my head) that I wasn't going in expecting Alien or Predator; I'd have had to be nuts to think I was going to get a film with that level of expertise from Paul W. S. Anderson, who's a fun director, but not a creator of deathless art. Once I allowed myself to think the film was going to be brainlessly entertaining, that's exactly what I got. The little in-jokes were fantastic, and some surprisingly subtle (did you catch the homage to an earlier franchise film with Lex and the bottlecap?), the action was fun, the effects were monstrous. One thing I did wonder, though-- why were all the aliens so little? Though, granted, the time frames in this movie were stretching anything remotely resembling reality, the original Alien burst out of John Hurt's chest and grew to full size in an exceptionally short period of time (remember that Ripley, in Aliens, puts the timeframe of the original movie at ""less than twenty-four hours"" when addressing the soldiers), so it's not like these guys take a long time to grow up. And has anyone noticed how, with each successive movie, the gestation time of an alien, once it reaches its human host, has gotten shorter and shorter?

Still, despite all the nits to pick, Alien vs. Predator is the kind of effects extravaganza that's going to appeal to a goodly portion of the masses. And, for some reason I can't understand, this time I'm one of the masses it appeals to. *** ",1093305600,4,7696,4.665929203539823
1566918,3,B00005JMZK,"I was kind of hoping this movie was going to be really better than it actually was.  The idea of Alien vs. Predator sounded interesting...even though I had never seen the original Predator before.  However, I was a bit disappointed.  While the plot was good in itself, the actors weren't convincing enough to pull it off.  There were parts of the film that were so boring, I had to try hard not to fall asleep!  The movie felt more like a cross between Aliens and Tomb Raider than Predator.  There is better at the theater right now.

If you want to see some great alien movies...only the series with Sigourney Weaver will satisfy your hunger.  Skip this one in the theater and wait for it on DVD.  You'll be glad you did!",1093305600,,722,4.409090909090909
1566919,3,B00005JMZK,"The people who put together ""Alien vs. Predator"" learned absolutely nothing from Mel Gibson's ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""  One thing they should have learned is that you can have a successful American movie in which nobody speaks English.  This movie should have been set on a planet far, far away, but writer-director Paul W. S. Anderson sets it on Earth so that a bunch of characters who can speak English get to explain what is going on before they are killed by one side or the other.  There is some irony here because the opening credits are translated from the language of the Predators into English, but the key thing is the more these Happy Meals with legs explain the harder it is to make what is happening in this film make sense in terms of the ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" series.

That is because not only does Anderson set this movie on Earth, he sets it in October of this year.  The basic premise is that a satellite belonging to super rich guy Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers a pyramid 2000 feet beneath the ice on an island in Antarctica.  So in the grand tradition of ""Jurassic Park"" (Anderson rips off a lot of familiar movies in cobbling together this story) he hires some experts to rush down and get there before anybody else.  Of course, the race is already lost but Weyland will not know that until it is way too late.

Of those who are to probably die the three bodies that stand out are Alexa Woods (Sanna Lathan), the guide who knows about traveling on icy-snowy terrain, Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova), the archeologists who apparently knows about all of the pyramids on Earth and the languages of those who built them from Mexico to Egypt to Cambodia, and Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner), a mechanical engineer with a Scottish accent.  ""Lex"" is the sole voice of reason in the endeavor, Sebastian provides the exposition, and Graeme gets to be scared to his own shadow and worry about his two laddies back home.  Lex also has the advantage of being female as well as being the only sane one in the group, so you have to like her chances.

While the ease with which Sebastian explains the meaning of everything in the underground pyramid is bothersome enough (the predators are kind enough to use Earth languages and an Earth calendar in the pyramid), the entire back story of how Predators come to be hunting Aliens is even worse.  I do not think having your audience trying to figure out how what you are doing fits into the continuity of the first movie in each series, let alone each series in its entirety, is a good thing.  I also bet I am not the only one who will notice the strong comparisons between this movie and a video game, which is not surprising given Anderson's experience with ""Resident Evil.""

Another major problem is that everything on that Antarctic island or down at the pyrmaid happens in the dark (despite the fact that October in the southern hemisphere would ""summer"" and not the long winter), so that it is hard to tell what is going on or where it is happening.  This would be another lesson missed from Mel Gibson's film, which went to the other extreme in letting you see everything that was happening.  But ""AvP"" is like all the rest of this generation of specific effects movies where scenes are shot in the dark and constant cutting is used to give you a vague sense of the fight.  There is nothing comparable to the memorable encounters between Sigourney and the Queen in ""Aliens"" or Swarzenegger and the original ""Predator.""  They set the bar and this film faces some mandatory deductions.

Fortunately the fight at the end of the film is the best of the bunch in terms of being able to see what is going on so that the film does try to end on a relative high note.  You will probably guess how things will play out in the end and you might even be willing to go along with the film's end game.  But if you have watched the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" series with any degree of appreciation or affection, you are going to burst out laughing at the final shot of the film.  That is not a good thing in a monster movie.

Final Note:  The Zenith City is so off the beaten path that we do not have enough screens to accommodate all of the movies this summer.  Consequently, when I went to go see ""Alien vs. Predator"" the markee outside the theater announced one of the other movies to be ""Exorcist Without a Paddle.""  Admit it.  Already you can envision the story line about how Father Merrin is up the proverbial creek and the deep announcers box intoning ""Exorcist Without a Paddle.""",1093219200,4,4558,4.520097442143727
1566920,3,B00005JMZK,"... a little TOO easy. Darn ""PG-13...""

While many remember the AvP ""demand"" starting with the Alien trophy quickly glimpsed in ""Predator 2,"" the real start of all of this was Dark Horse Comics' 1989 series ""Alien Vs Predator."" In that series a decent amount of time (an entire first issue, to be exact) is used for set up... and the rest kind of follows the basics of this movie. Humans killed by Predators, humans killed by Aliens (or ""bugs""), humans get help from one lone Predator. Oh, and human convenietly forgets that Predator, A) has already wasted a good number of humans, and B) HAS BROUGHT THE ALIEN TO EARTH, allowing the creatures to possibly kill everything.

AvP the movie does indeed suffer from it's rating. Remember last year when the producers of ""Terminator 3"" said that going after anything BUT a ""R"" rating would be doing the franchise, and its fans, a disservice? The truth of that statement wins out in a bad way here. We WANT to see the chest bursting and the tail impaling and the Predators blowing macho humans into space dust. But the studio needs that fifteen year old's $$. Not that they all don't find a way into ""R"" movies anyway... but that is another rant...

AvP is a decent movie if you know what you are in for when you enter the theater. My complaint, really, was that there was not enough Predator. And the explanation of this ancient society seeding the world's great archealogical religions and such? Do we really CARE? Get back to the Aliens stabbing people, please?

Like I said, a decent popcorn jaunt... but I am kinda glad I had the free movie ticket form my ""Predator"" Special Edition DVD...",1093219200,3,1638,4.5993150684931505

Never can trust the ""Critics"".  If it is not a ""Feel Good"" or Wishy, Washy movie, then it's not good enough for them.  BITE ME

I saw The English Patient - BORING.  A Fish Called Wanda - STUPID and BORING.  Big Fish - REALLY STUPID and BORING.  Not even the special effects saved this movie.

1566922,3,B00005JMZK,"I had wanted this movie to be made ever since I saw the Alien skull in the trophy case on the Predator ship in the movie Predator Two. That is in fact the genesis of this movie, methinks.

For a movie that was inspired by a single scene in another film, this film was acceptable. The acting was not great, and there are no real famous names in the film but then none are really needed. The dialogue was not all that notable, neither sparking in watchwords or memorable phrases, nor was it over the top or corny. The Fx's were passable, though they did have one overdone Matrix type moment or two. The script was the weakest point, other than some well-used sci-fi cliches like the lost temple/artifact-in-a-remote-vastness'-of-the-world cliche along with the mankind-was-taught-technology-from-extraterrestrials concept. The weakness' of the script was notable on two main points: I do not think that a whaling station abandoned for exactly a century to Antarctica's weather would be that well preserved, and they were able to too readily translate the markings in the temple. Basically, they did not account for the fact that languages change over time, as well just saying that the markings were a polygot of Egyptian, Aztec/Mayan and Cambodian. The only other weak point I noted in the script was the gestation period of the aliens was drastically shorter than of the one that killed Caine in Alien. That weakness, I am told, is explained if you have followed the game, graphic novel, or the comic-books under the same title.

The basic premise is that as their forebears have done for thousands of years, a training class of Predators have come to Earth for the final test before they can join their adult society. The test is, of course, against Aliens, the lost temple being made solely as a prison for a queen that they bring out of cryogenic stasis. Humans are lured there to be hosts and the battle is on....The Predators have a sharp disadvantage because of the humans....

The movie is set in the present day, making it actually take place before Predator Two, its inspiration. The fact that they actually put a date in the film was one of the factors that made me think this is really just a Predator movie that has aliens in it, as opposed to being an equal showing of the two franchises.

Overall, I think the film was moderately entertaining and worth watching once.",1093219200,,2381,4.757869249394673
1566923,4,B00005JMZK,"AVP is a movie that has been in the making for a long time.  Ever since an alien head showed up in ""Predator 2"", fans have been craving this match up.  Now it is finally here, but do fans get what they have been waiting for?  Yes, and no.

The discovery of pyramid in Antarctica prompts Charles Bishop Weyland (Henriksen) to mount an expidition there.  When his team enters the pyramid, they set off sensors that seal off the pyramid and set the wall into motion.  Quickly they discover alien eggs that begin to open and predators that are looking for some aliens to hunt.  It seems that this temple is used every 100 years as a rite of passage for the predators.  Now, the humans are caught in the middle and must choose a side if they want to have any hope of getting out alive.

AVP does deliver some good battles between the aliens and the predators, but even the best of them suffer from what is my biggest complaint with this movie.  The director and producers have taken two R-rated franchises and joined them up into a PG-13 battle royale.  The only possible reason to deliver a PG-13 movie is to get a lot of teenagers into the audience, and it is a shame that this movie is watered down because of it.  The mythology of the two creatures is changed a bit for the movie, but that did not bother me.  The actors did serviceable jobs, but they are not why you would go see AVP.  Better than last year's ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", AVP is worth checking out for those seeking a good monster match up.",1093219200,,1498,4.303571428571429

1566994,3,B00005JMZK,"""What type of room did you say this was?""

""Sacrificial Chamber.""

- Two members of the Weyland expedition team are about to get date-raped by two alien facehuggers in ""Alien vs. Predator""

As a die-hard fan of both ""Alien"" & ""Predator"" films, I found that ""Alien Vs. Predator"" is an insult to fans & is about as scary as a kiddie-fart in Church, on a cold Sunday in January. The film is an unscary, videogame style mess that can't compare to any of the installments in either ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" films & comes in last place when ranking both series together (in all honesty, I tried to like this film, but, I just couldn't). What really pissed me off was, I had high hopes that this film would get the special type of treatment that could, possibly, revitalize both series. That ain't gonna happen.

Its October 2004. A satelite (owned by a company thats led by Charles Bishop Weyland) has picked up a mysterious heat signature 2000 feet below the surface in the No Man's Land style section of the Antartica. Weyland forms a rag-tag expedition to check out whats exactly up there and what specifically is going on.

The expediton is about to pay for this excursion with there very lives, as they find out that the heat sig. is a pyramid constructed by the Predator species hundreds to thousands of years earlier. Every hundred years the structure is used as a rite of passage hunting ground for young Predators (what the f*ck?!?). What are they hunting? Aliens. The team finds out that there actually bait and sacrificial sheep for the Aliens, with little hope of survival.

With the popularity between both film series, not to mention the first official smackdown in the ""Aliens vs. Predator"" Dark Horse comic book series, & the engrossing video game of the same name, you would actually think ""20th Century Fox"" would grow a brain and give this project to someone who, at least had a clue, as to what they were directing. Unfortunately, Paul W. S. Anderson can't grow a brain or buy a clue and the result is like watching someone else play a video game. Badly. Anderson continues his career path on becoming the planets suckiest director (I don't think he could direct himself out of an asthma attack!).

The characters are so cardboard a Domino's Pizza box could emote more emotion! Lance Henrikson is o.k. as Weyland, in a nice nod to ""Aliens"". Other then that, I could care less about anyone of the characters (Ellen Ripley isn't this film and she's missed. a lot).

The special effects are what save the film somewhat. The battle at the end of the film was cool and ""AVP"" gets a small repeal in this respect, but not much. Both species have never looked better (but in the defense of the original films, once an Alien/Predator, always an Alien/Predator).

The film isn't without its loopholes. The first one I noticed is - if the pyramid hunt is a rite of passage for the Predator then what the hell were the first two Predators (from ""Predator"" and ""Predator 2"") doing on Earth?! The other loophole is that the Alien incubation cycle is longer than 15 min. In ""Alien"" it was suspensefull, errie, and disgusting to watch the Alien go from chestburster to the full size, slimy creature. In ""AVP"" the Aliens are reduced to the screen version of Sea Monkeys! During some of the fight scenes between the Alien & Predators, some of the Predators metal weapons melt on contact from the Aliens acidic blood, yet, in some scenes there weapons come back unscathed.

Worst of all, ""AVP"" is rated PG-13, taking the edge out of both creatures, and insuring mommies, who have wittwe boys under 13, that they won't wet their beds from having nightmares.

Thats like Mike Tyson licking Holyfields ear instead munching on it!

""Alien vs. Predator"" is like the soccer mom version of ""Alien"" or ""Predator"".

1566998,4,B00005JMZK,"Combining these two franchises was an extremely difficult sell to the public.  They managed to combine the two in a credible film with a somewhat believeable script.

An old civilization in Antartica, where Predators were once revered, has been ""discovered"" by the human race.  Craig Bishop Wehylan organizes a team to catalog and analyze the pyramid as his legacy.  Little does he know, that this ""pyramid""  is an old battle chamber for the Predators, where aliens are bred and born of human sacrifice to act as training for the Predators.  It basically passes the Predators onto a new level of ""Warrior""  if they are to defeat the Aliens.

This is not explained very well in the movie, and that is it's major failure.  A lot of assumption has to come into play for the viewer.  I also don't like the lack of violence.  PG-13!?!

A terrible mistake by Fox!!!  The franchise has keyed on the over 18 year-ols.  Not the teenies!!!!  major mistake!!!  the R-rated DVD will be very special.

1566999,4,B00005JMZK,"Just came back from seeing this with my ten year old boy. Firstly, I almost didn't go see this based on the other negative reviews I read here. My boy wanted to see it anyway so we went and I'm glad we did. This movie really is good. Sure there's a couple of technical details that don't jive with other Alien/Predator movies that could have been caught in editing but jeez so what!

One thing I hadn't read in the negative reviews was that although once again a girl is the hero, this time she's black on top of it. There's an element of Communism/Liberalism injected as a very small side theme in this story which isn't at all unusual for Hollywood these days. For instance, the girl is black, an environmentalist and she's also a world class climber and is thereby somehow uniquely qualified to guide the exploration team. No explanations given for any of that. The financial backing for the exploration comes from a wealthy corporate capitalist White man who needs something to achieve fame to give meaning to his life due to his imminent death(he's critically ill). And that's all that's really bad about the story line that I can say about this film.

Otherwise, it's a very good movie. The story is suspenseful and in places scary. The fight scenes are very good. The special effects (Alien babies included) are at least as good as those from the other movies. The story itself as explained in the movie makes some sense and moves along at a good pace. By the way, the girl who plays the hero does a stand-up great job. Just terrific. I thoroughly enjoyed this lady's performance. I wasn't expecting that.

All in all I'd say if you're reading this wondering if you should spend the time and money on it and you loved Aliens and Predator then you will probably enjoy this movie very much as well. Just don't nitpick it to death.",1093046400,,1835,4.537764350453172
1567000,4,B00005JMZK,"Movies containing ""versus"" are nothing new. These are evidenced by the twenty or so Godzilla movies. The most recent example was ""Freddy versus Jason,"" a surprise hit to many with a sequel already in the works. Alien versus Predator is a long-awaited movie that pitches the Aliens from the ""Alien"" movie saga against the Predators from the ""Predator"" movie saga. The Alien versus Predator, or AvP, movie has been in the works ever since the infamous appearance of the Alien skull inside the Predator ship in ""Predator 2"". The announcement that Paul Anderson was to direct the movie gave many Alien and Predator fans a chill. After all, Anderson's reputation for making what many to be mediocre video game movies precedes him.

Many would like to know how this movie stacks up to the others in the series. The truth it, it does and it doesn't. While it doesn't surpass the filmmaking of ""Alien"", ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"", it certainly seems to be a better experience then ""Predator 2"", ""Alien3"", and ""Alien: Resurrection"". Anderson seems to be brushing up on what made the latter two Alien movies less fun. Looking at the Aliens, Anderson kept them somewhat more to crevices and darkness. The Predators were more where Anderson put his touch. There seemed to be more altering with the Predators than the Aliens. While many hardcore Predator fans may scoff at the new weaponry, most regular fans will find them interesting.

What many are interested in is the plot and characters. The plot is basic action movie fare: The Weyland Corporation discovers a pyramid and it's Chairman, Charles Bishop Weyland forms a team of experts to explore the find which includes heroine Alex Woods. Unbeknownst to them, the Predators are luring them there in order to be hosts for their prey, the Aliens. To avoid any spoilers, what follows will please most AvP fans with Predators and Aliens fighting it out. Alex proves to be a convincing heroine and there's no doubt that she'll return in a possible sequel.

While the action is fit for the many Alien and Predator fans out there, there are several gripes about it. For one is the somewhat abuse of bullet time that Anderson seems to love so much. Also, the seemingly lack of story and character development besides the aforementioned Alex woods may irk some moviegoers. Another thing that always seems to bog down Paul Anderson is that many of the ""killable"" characters, and by that I mean characters that can be killed without too much penalty to the story, are killed off in the first half of the movie, leaving much of the second half without the action movie killing. While many are immediately turned off by the PG-13 rating, let me just say that there is room in there for a directors cut for the DVD release. I personally welcomed the change, as I was turned off by the amount of needless gore in the last two ""Alien"" movies.

In conclusion, AvP isn't a movie for everyone, as it will mainly appeal to fans of both series and won't disappoint.

Pros: The Alien on Predator action; the character of Alex Woods.

Cons: Standard action story; not much character development; loss of ""killable"" characters

Verdict: 77% Good for fans, not so much for regular moviegoers, though action fans may get something out of it.",1092960000,,3256,4.793226381461675

The movie kind of explains part of the history between the two different races, but doesn't go into much detail. The movie takes a while to get going and because the people in the movie are killed rather quickly, it doesn't leave much room for suspense.

One thing I am curious about from the film. Lance Henriksen play Charles Bishop Weyland, a man who is the father of modern robotics and likes to dabble in archeology. In ALIENS, Henriksen portrayed the android Bishop who was responsible for saving Ripley's life. I don't think the connection is a fluke: did Weyland create Bishop? I don't know, but it's kind of fun to think about.

For those Predator fans who might get upset because it seems the hunters have tossed out the rules, the rituals of the hunt, please remember that different prey is hunted in different ways.  And even Predators toss out the rules when things go wrong.

As for the Aliens they still scare the sh*t out of me (like they did in their first two movies).  Shiny, wet, evil creatures!  Yuckie-pooh!  They even surprised me in their first encounter with the Predators and gave the movie a cool ending!

 An expedition into Antarctica from the Weyland Company, including Charles Weyland (Lance Henriksen), and lead by a professional guide (Sanaa Lathan), discovers an ancient pyramid.  Their archaeologist (Raoul Bova) discovers it was built by humans for a special hunt for their gods.  Soon though their trapped within the pyramid as they fall into a war between aliens and predators.  A must see for anyone who loves the movies, the comics or the video games and for anyone who loves a good action/horror movie.

(Warning Spoilers)
 This is the only movie yet, that I have seen on opening night, so you can guess how I feel about the movie.  In a few words: I loved it!
 That means a lot coming from someone who saw fifty percent of the footage from trailers and a thirty-minute nationally televised making of documentary.
 If I have to sum it up in one word: Guts (or balls!).  Because let's face it, half of every one else reviewing this movie is going to hate it.  The Alien fans will hate it.  The Predator fans will hate it.  The critics will hate it.  But the people who hate Paul W.S. Anderson will love it.
 It took a lot of guts to make a movie with no victory in sight.
 While they are all welcome to their opinions, most of it will be unjustified.
 For one thing this is not a movie you go into wanting deep philosophical insight and deep visions of humanity.  You do not even walk in expecting a great deal of story.
 The Aliens Vs. Predator comics had more story!
 However, if you walk in to see one person's vision of Predator's and Alien's locked in mortal combat, you'll be rather pleased.
 Not everything in the movie makes sense at first glance, but you can come up with your own answers rather easily.
 The story and premises of the pyramid, the hunt and so on are pretty good.  Something the comic book writers probably wish they'd thought of.
 Also expecting accuracy to the comic book or video game is ludicrous.  Anyone who's read the plot should know, this isn't going to be loyal to anything other than the concept.
 People are also going to complain about Lance Henriksen, but let's face it, he's the only person that could be logically in this movie time-line.
 The other human actors fit in well enough.
 The Aliens and Predators look alright.
 Although a few notes about the Predators.  They seem either bigger or bulkier in this movie.  I mean not everyone is Kevin Peter Hall, but still.  I also think they might have gotten their faces too different, I know they're not Stan Winston, but it should be closer than that.
 At first it also seems criminal that neither the Alien nor Predator musical themes are used, but this is a stand-alone film.
 That's also one of the probable points of this film.  It's meant to stand by itself somewhat, as a kind of mirror universe that allows these two to meet.  To that extant it is a bit more acceptable.
 I do believe however you have to be a little knowledgeable about either the films, the comics or the video games.  Otherwise people who aren't are not going to get it.
 Especially the final scene, which is a kind last salute to the geeks.  It might not make sense, but it's a great little note for the monster lovers.
 In the theater I attended, after the little `creature' revealed itself, someone in attendance said, ""Mother$%^*!""  Ha, Ha, ha!  That should be the final line of the movie, like or dislike!  Ha, Ha, Ha!
 The movie is definitely better than King Kong Vs. Godzilla (although I love that one too).
 The movie does contain it's share of surprises and I really got into the final battle with the queen.
 The fight scenes are great.  The special effects are great.  The actors are great.  The whole thing is great.
 It admittedly could have used more of everything, but it makes a great prologue.
 I'm personally just hoping for a sequel (or at least more Predator movies!).

P.S.
 One final note, to date the average star review on amazon.com is something like three or three-and-a-half stars, with 140 reviews and counting.  The novelization, has the same three to three-and-a-half- stars average, with only 16 reviews and counting.  Interesting.",1092873600,17,4166,4.599455040871935
1567045,1,B00005JMZK,"I just read a report of an interview with director Paul W.S. Anderson (director of AVP). He said quote ""that all the best scenes were cut from the film."" He also said that the movie was always going to be R-rated until the studio enforced a PG-13 rating 3 WEEKS before releasing the film. In addition to the violence and gore cut from the film, a sub-plot that further explained the plot was cut as well. If it had been in the film, the cut footage would have cleared up many continuity issues. For example, the sped up alien life cycle in this film is not a careless error at all; the machine that holds the alien queen captive also injects horomones and drugs in to her, speeding up the facehugger/chestburster process. The footage that was cut would have explained that and also would have given the characters more screen time. Director Paul W.S. Anderson also mentioned that the explosion at the end took up HALF of the 65 million dollar budget (which is ridiculously low for a film like this).

So when you see this film and end up hating it, don't blame the director. He made a film that, if it had been released in the original cut, would have pleased long time fans of the franchises. But instead, the studio made it PG-13 (so more people could see it) and cut out a lot of footage to make the film way too short (to fit in more screenings per day).

BUT, the changes the studio made are helping. Currently the film is making A LOT of money, mostly because of the PG-13 rating. This means that the studio will be more likely to greenlight AVP 2 or, more importantly, ALIEN 5. But try to realize that if the film had been released in the original uncut version, it probably would've only made half the money the current cut has because not as many people would have been able to see it.

Luckily, an R-rated Director's cut WILL be released on DVD sometime in the future. This edition will up all the violence and gore to an R-rated level (all the off screen deaths will now be ON-screen as originally filmed) and add in an additional sub-plot that will clear up continuity issues, give the characters more screen time, and make the plot development clearer. As a long time fan of the original 6 R rated movies, I was ECSTATIC to hear this.

Unfortunately, movies aren't made to be good anymore. They're made to make money, and AVP is doing that right now. So when you see this film, know that you aren't seeing the final version of the film. But PLEASE see it because it needs all the money it can make. And also, PLEASE buy the director's cut DVD when it comes out because its gonna kick a**.

1567046,1,B00005JMZK,"""No matter who wins... We lose"". If the ""we"" they are refeering to in the marketing slogan for Paul Anderson's ""Alien Vs. Predator"" is the people who have to sit through it than they certainly should be rewarded for honesty. Fox's latest attempt to cash in on the success of dueling movie icons that caught on with last summer's ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" could not be more shameless and embarassing if they added Jim Varney's Ernest character to the mix. I can say from the very start that I wasn't expecting this extraterrestrial grudge match to be anything special, especially considering its ""PG-13"" rating but despite my low expectations, this one talk ""bad"" to a whole other level.

""Alien Vs. Predator"" involves a billionare who hires a team of random weirdos to go on an exploration of an Antartic pyramid. As it turns out, the title creatures are waiting for them. The Predators, a team of alien hunters who use invisible cloaking as a camoflauge are the first to attack. Anderson more or less recyles all of the killings from ""Predator 2"" but waters them down to the point where you feel like you're watching a bad made-for-cable movie. He also seems to conviently throw in new ideas for both creatures that lack any logic whatsoever. The ""aliens"" in this film seem to grow in minutes while in every other ""Alien"" film, it took many hours. Subsquently, while in the past, the Predator almost never came out of camoflauge during its hunts until the final act of the film, it seems to like to give away its locations at inappropraite times to give its human counterparts a chance to escape and its less-technical enemy a fair chance to kill it.

Speaking of the humans, if there were ever a more boring set of characters thrown together for a monster movie, I certainly have never seen it. Sanaa Lathan's female hero is no Sigourney Weaver and it's amazing that despite all the damage she takes, she doesn't seem to have a scratch on her. She is punted like a football across the pyramid by the Predator but manages to run away after and even parades around in zero-degree weather in a T-shirt. Of course, all the characters are given pointless backstory that has nothing to do with the story at all. Ewen Bremner's obnoxious character in particular can't shut up about his two children. Even the reliable Lance Henriksen is all over the place as Charles Bishop Weyland (a ""wink at the camera"" homage to his android character from the Alien movies).

""Alien Vs. Predator"" isn't just a traditional bad movie, it is bad on an epic level. The first act is tired and dragged out with the characters explaining all of the pointless elements of the plot for about forty-five minutes. The second act has the humans, Predators, and aliens going at it with one another with no regard for logic, the series mytholigy, or good filmmaking. Not only are trademark elements and characterstistics from both series either toned down for the MPAA or just all together thrown out the window but Anderson manages to come up with his own cheesy rules for both. By the third act, anyone who loved both or either series has either gone crazy and walked out of the theatre or just begun to laugh out loud. I opted for the latter. Without giving away anything, I will say that the concluding act of this movie is so outrageously ridicilous that I honestly think Anderson just gave up and let his nine-year-old son write it. Think ""Jaws: The Revenge"". By the time the movie has ended, we are treated to a Queen Alien that moves like the T-Rex from the ""Jurrasic Park"" movies, a Predator that seems more like a poor clone of the ones used in the other films, and a sequence where face-huggers dive out in ""bullet time"".

You don't need to have seen any of the ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" movies to watch this (apparently Anderson didn't when he wrote it) but it helps in enjoying the all-out rape of both franchises. Paul Anderson got a lot of negative criticism before this film came out for being a hack. I felt a lot of it was unfair as ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Resident Evil"" (both of which he directed) were at least slightly entertaining. After watching his work as both a writer and directer on this project, I am starting to understand why there was such a collective moan from many fanboys across the world when he was signed on for this one. Fox will end up being the real winners here as they stand to make a great deal of loot off this embarassing mess of a movie.",1092873600,3,4440,4.58816120906801

1567128,1,B00005JMZK,"I am an avid fan of both Predator and Alien.  My brother and I have been waiting patiently to see this movie ever since we heard that it was becoming a reality after all these years of rumors.  I checked the AvP website often to watch the latest trailers and get the latest info.  One of the 'behind the scenes' clips on the website actuall has Anderson stating that ""the audience would be really worried if they thought that there were only scientists on no guys with machine guns.""  But, in fact, there were only scientists, and no guys with machine guns.  As stated in many other reviews here, this movie sucked.  I expected so much more.  The story line was aweful.  The ending was an offensive ripoff of Predator 2.  The Predators were not 'hunting', they were running away in fear of their lives.  In fact, the scientists actually killed more Aliens that the Predators did.  The biggest error of this whole film was that it takes place on the planet earth.  Come on people!  Predators, Aliens; helloooo.  What movie making handbook says that movies about aliens always take place on earth.  Stupid.  This movie was lacking the 'coolness' factor.  It just had nothing cool about it.  It didn't have anything new or exciting.  It did not expound on either the Predator race or the Alien race any further than the lame story line required.  In short, this was a movie about some scientists who found a pyramid in the arctic, and there were some Aliens and Predators too.  This was not an Alien vs Predator movie.  This was a movie about humans, and the Aliens and Predators were extras.  Anderson should be ashamed of himself for creating such garbage, in the process ignoring the legacies of both the Alien and the Predator movies.  Boooooooo

My brother and I are in the process of writing 'Predator - King's Honor' an actual good Predator movie.  And yes, it has some Aliens in it, but just as prey.  It does NOT take place on earth, it does NOT have any humans in it, and it expounds greatly on the Predator home planet, other weapons, other outfits, other skills besides shooting laser guns, different tribes, and yes, spaceships in detail.  How would you like to see a Predator fight a T-Rex in hand-to-hand combat?  How about a Predator fighting another Predator?

1567129,4,B00005JMZK,"I recently became an avid fan of the Alien films, as I had some extra cash and picked up the Alien Quadrilogy on DVD...a real treat for any fan of sci-fi and horror.  Never having seen a Predator film, I still think that regardless the studio, crossing over franchises is a shameful way to get audiences to crawl into a theater.  It's next to impossible to focus on a sensible plot and have entertaining characters.  This is what plagued Freddy vs. Jason.  I've been a Friday/Nightmare fan for as long as I can remember, and it was New Line's best attempt at this kind of flick since the 80s Nightmare films, but the story and concept fell flat on its face.  The other thing that threw me off was the watered-down PG-13 rating.  Going in with mixed expectations, I can only sum this up one way: Jurassic Park with a bunch of aliens running around.

Funny thing was, I wasn't aware this was a Paul Anderson film until I walked out of the theater.  For some reason, people either love or hate his movies.  Needless to say, he is definitely a franchise director, coming off films such as Mortal Kombat, and the exceptional thriller, Resident Evil.  His biggest criticisms are drawn from the fact that he strays from the tried-and-true formula of said franchises, and does something completely brilliant...or at least, different from the original intent of the story.  Either way, he is a director with a certain amount of pinage.  He can take an R-rated franchise such as this, water down the gore and still sustain the suspense.  That was the true beauty of the film.

The first half an hour really drags on.  The only thing that caught my attention was the re-introduction of Lance Henrikson's character, Mr. Weyland, who eventually becomes the mock-up for the cyborg character, Bishop, from Aliens on.  It has a group of science engineers roaming to an underground structure in the mist of Antarctica.  During a rigid storm, the Predators' ship lands, and the bounty hunters immediately begin taking on their prey.  Like the first two Predator films, they start off invisible, and pick off their prey using infra-red sight.  Eventually, the aliens are hatched via peoples' bodies, in traditional Alien form (minus the overhaul on blood and guts), and both races have it out.  The action only heightens throughout the film.

Te only major criticism is that a lot of the action sequences at the beginning are extremely fast, to the point that it looks blurred.  Imagine a five-year-old running around aimlessly with a camcorder; that's the effect.  However, as aliens and predators start to die off, scenes are more focused, and eventually, a story does evolve.  How a mere human can automatically pick up this whole predator vs. alien backstory just by analyzing a few ancient drawings is beyond me, but let's not forget the focus on the film itself: it's a freakin' alien movie.

All I can say is, for true Alien and Predator fans, it delivers the goods on both angles, with a story that while, not really complex, holds your attention.  And even at a PG-13, people with younger kids should be weary...it's not all wine and roses.",1092787200,2,3130,4.75
1567130,1,B00005JMZK,"I have to get this all out, because it is killing me. For a few days now I have felt sullen, drained of spirit, and perhaps not wanting to go on with life. It has been sometime now since I have viewed AVP. In the first five minutes of the movie I thought to myself, ""I very well may be watching the worst movie I have ever payed to see"", and that I would not leave my seat if only to let the movie prove or disprove that. At the end of the film, I did not even need any further time to think it over. It's without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen, period. The fact that this talentless opportunist, Paul W.S. Anderson was the ""writer & dicrector"" behind this disgraceful sham wasn't a surprise at all as far as I'm concerned. I really can't recall personally watching any recent movie as dreadfully bad as ""Alien Vs. Predator"", and coming away feeling quite as psychially nauseated as i was. Generally speaking, a movie, any movie will have *some* type, *some* sort of redeeming quality. Be it the writing, direction, acting, photography, special effects, production values and so forth. ""Alien Vs. Predator"" is absolutely devoid of any such aspects whatsoever, a typically classic Paul W.S. Anderson trait and trademark. It's as if the ""writer & director"" of this film - Paul W.S. Anderson was thinking; ""how can I remove EVERYTHING that's redeeming from these two particular legendary cinematic ADULT ORIENTED creatures (the Alien & the Predator), and create a kiddy/teen/family McDonalds ,Burger King MTV friendly PG-13 franchise?"".

Yes! SERIOUSLY!

This film has absolutely NONE of the atmosphere that ANY classic Alien or Predator flicks had (or even that of the video games it is based on), there is virtually NONE of the human blood-&-gore you would come to expect from the previous ADULT ORIENTED Alien/Predator movies. The once feared yet equally fascinating Aliens now more resemble south east Asian cockroaches, rather than the originally concieved H.R. Giger bio-mechanical creature that debuted in ALIEN (1979) and returned in ALIENS (1986). While the Predators now give the on-screen appearance of being completely inept overweight power-ranger rejects, in serious need of self defense classes. Hack-job extrordinaire - Paul W.S. Anderson, has also taken it upon himself to re-write the already established Alien's life-cycle. What was a 24-hour or more process of being facehugged by a face-hugger, impregnation by the creature, and then it keeping it's victim in a coma while the chest-burster within the host matures before birthing itself....is now an instantaneous 5 minute process. Talk about a complete and utter disregard for continuity. Sickening.

To top it off, I have never seen a movie in which every aspect lacked any semblance of human emotion. EVERY character in this ""film"" (i use that term loosely) is paper-thin and more transparent than the oxygen we breathe. The result of this is that you absolutely do not care or give a damn for any of these mental challenged disposable extras that habit this complete waste of celluloid. Every aspect of this film is artistically and stylistically void of feeling. There is absolutely no conviction in anything spoken or acted. The film lacks any human quality to it. Equate It to trying to play with your pet dog/cat that's just been hit & killed by a car. You can stand it up and it still looks like your dog/cat, sorta, except that, well......it's dead. That's Alien Vs. Predator in a nutshell.

Perhaps Anderson's biggest failure in the movie is the endlessly tedious and poorly choreographed (disastrously edited) mediocre action sequences.

For someone who repeatedly gets work in the action genre, this face-hugging parasite, Paul W.S. Anderson, couldn't direct decent action if his very existence depended on it. Not to mention the fact that the dialogue (written,of course by...you guessed it, talentless extrordinaire, Paul W.S. Anderson) is literally worse than the god-awful dialogue featured in the video games that this sickly diseased studio exploitation is based on.

Honestly, there has rarely ever been a more openly brutal attack on human intelligence than this movie. It should be archived and shown to captured AL-QAEDA operatives as a form of mental torture. If anyone out there believes there is a movie out there that is worse, please tell me and I will do whatever I have to do to back up my case that AVP is as fatal as brain-cancer.

It's now been a while since I saw this vomit-fest, and I still feel the disgust and physical nausea inside me. I was hoping that the passing of time would help clear it out, but I still feel anger. The pain! Make it stop! Please make it stop! It's killing me! I can't believe this passes for modern day cinematic Alien/Predator entertainment. If you were entertained by this, and believe it's on par with it's classic cinematic predecessors: ALIEN, ALIENS, ALIEN3 & PREDATOR; then you perhaps may also find being hit around the head repeatedly by an onslaught of brass knuckles or throwing yourself in front of speeding 18 wheelers enjoyable also. It gets two thumbs down. It also gets two middle fingers, straight up. I implore you, do not support this utter garbage like I unwittingly did. Wait until it comes out on DVD or video, and THEN rent something else. This movie is against all that is beautiful in film, art, and life. The fact that this talentless waste of skin (Paul W.S. Anderson) continues to work in ""film"" (and gets the assignment of writing & directing this long-delayed and highly-anticipated VERSUS film) is beyond me, because his films are always a trainwreck that's happened before the train has even left the station. I have nothing more to say.

It wasn't reason fro regret, though. ""Alien vs. Predator"" probably is much less violent and less dirty ten republicans and their power-greedy strategies. Then, what was supposed to be a night of disgust and horror seeing what ""Fahrenheit 9/11 unveils, became a opportunity of much fun.

Predator and Alien are just loveable. You can't help loving those Ugly MFs . I am even looking for them in stuffed animals versions. This movie is even above the works of George Lucas. (We don't have to talk here about Spielberg. Only the typing of his name is sickening in itself). Anyway, it was a great shot bring Alien and Predator together. It made better what has been the best for 15 years now. When I was a teenager all the kids wanted to be Predator or alien after seeing them on the screen. What more complements can be given when the villains win the hearts of the viewers and not the so called heroes ?

The screenplay lacks a little consistence and attention. It had more holes than Swiss cheese. But, when you love Swiss , you don't care about the holes. The wholes are a natural part of this kind of cheese.

If there was an Oscar for the most fun characters, Predator and Alien should be carrying the little statue from the stage. This is the merit for the legacy for always defeating their killers outside the screen.

As a kid I loved the Alien movies.  Aliens (the 2nd one) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh about how my mother caused M&M's to rain down on the theater after an alien scared her.  So, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories.

What a disappointment.  It wasn't scary at all.  People in the theater were actually ***SLEEPING***.  I was jealous of them.  I was mostly glad that this was a short movie.  Sadly, the scariest thing in this movie was a penguin.

1567135,3,B00005JMZK,"**Warning: Spoilers ahead**

I should have seen this coming. When I first heard that Paul W.S. Anderson was going to be directing this movie, I was really worried. With Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, and Soldier under his film-making belt, I wouldn't have really considered him to be the best choice to direct a movie with two of the greatest sci-fi creatures ever. But when I saw some pre-release internet featurettes with Anderson talking about his plans for Alien vs. Predator, I immediately got the sense that he really wanted to make great movie. His enthusiasm for the subject matter convinced me to give him a chance. Now that I have seen Anderson's finished product, I should have realized that wanting to make a good movie, and actually making a good movie are two completely separate things.

The plot of AvP centres on a pyramid that was discovered in Antarctica by the Weyland Corporation. The corporation's owner, Charles Bishop Weyland, heads up an expedition to the site, only to stumble into a battle between the aforementioned Aliens and Predators. The premise of the story is a little hokey, but I was willing to forgive it because the story's main purpose was simply to find a way to have these creatures be in the same room with each other, which was all I cared about.

The acting in this movie was at best stale, and the dialogue that came out of these actors' mouths was worse. Lines such as 'it's like finding Moses' DVD collection' were just some of the things in this movie that made me roll my eyes back. Also, even after a long speech detailing how not to explore anywhere alone, as soon as the explorers arrive on Antarctica what does one of them do? He explores an abandoned building alone (my eyes are facing the back of my skull at this point). Still, knowing that this is a Paul W.S. Anderson movie I expected this. I will say though that there was one bright acting spot in this entire movie, and that was Lance Henriksen. He plays the sullen Charles Weyland (as well as the android Bishop in Aliens and Alien 3), and is the only person who was able to pull of a decent acting job.

My one major complaint with this movie is the fact that it focuses too much on the human characters. If I recall this movie was named 'Alien Vs. Predator' not 'Watch the Humans Run Around Scared'. My guess is that director Anderson thought that by focusing on the humans and their plight it would create a meatier story. Now don't get me wrong. I think it's great that Anderson wanted to add more depth to AvP, but I went to see this movie with one single purpose...to see Aliens and Predators kick each other's asses.

Unfortunately, it takes about 30 minutes before we get to the first fight (and I should note this is only a 90 minute movie), and when they were not fighting the movie was (frankly) kind of boring. Also, there was this scene towards the end of the movie where the Predator and a human survivor (I won't say who) were running together with things blowing up behind them in slow-mo Matrix style. They were both acting so 'buddy-buddy' like and quite simply it looked out of place and incredibly cheesy, but you would have to see it to understand my full meaning.

If you are an impatient reader, you might have already scrolled down to the bottom of my review and saw my final score of 6 out of 10, and you are probably wondering why, after all the bad things I have said, would I give a score like that? Why not a 3 or 4 out of 10? Well, despite the movie's many flaws it does have a few good points. First and most obvious, the special effects in this movie are top notch. The design of the Predators' ship is just amazing. The costume design of the Predators and the weapons that they use are spectacular. Also, what few fight scenes there are between the Aliens and Predators are jaw-droppingly good. Seeing a Predator twirl an Alien 360 degrees through stone pillars before throwing it against the wall was just plain cool. However, these few high points are not enough to save the movie.

I'll be honest though. Despite Alien Vs. Predator being a disappointment, I hope it does make a lot of money. By doing well at the box office, hopefully Fox will greenlight Alien 5 or Predator 3, or both. However, should Fox decide to make an AvP sequel down the road, they NEED a change of directors. I know this is just wishful thinking, but it would be great if Fox could get Ridley Scott (director of Alien), James Cameron (director of Aliens), or John McTiernan (director of Predator 1), because those guys could make an excellent AvP sequel. I would hate it if Anderson's Alien Vs. Predator is the last hurrah for two of the best sci-fi creatures in movie history.

I give Alien Vs. Predator 6 out of 10.",1092700800,,4739,4.495934959349594
1567196,5,B00005JMZK,"I am glad that I went to see AVP because it was an awesome movie!!! Period!!! Just looking at Predator alone gave me a sense of fear and power. Yes the movie might have some cheesy moments and the movie lasted only an hour and a half but just having both Predator and Aliens as ONE supreme being in a movie is just so exhilirating..!!!! Predator itself with its new and powerful weaponry fights like a real hunter!!! People might say there are only 1 or 2 fighting scenes together but those scenes are great, quick and straight to the point. There's no point running around the bushes... We all know that Predator and Aliens are killers so what's the point of hiding from one another. I was totally into the movie when Predator fights Alien. It was just so cool and exciting and I couldn't wait to see who will win and how they would defend themselves and fight till the last breath. Predator did use stealth..... But when the first predator who was using stealth at that time was killed by the Alien from behind I was like....oh nooooo...  here comes the Aliens defending their ground. The Aliens were able to sense the whereabouts of Predator eventhough they were using stealth. If not this movie would have ended so easily with Predator wiping every Aliens single handedly.

This time around the humans were not the hunted. Predator is not here on earth to hunt humans because humans are simply no match, we saw that already in Previous installments. There's a reason why they came to earth. And that is????? He he!!! You have to watch it to find out more. I was just so awed by this movie.  You could see Predator fighting head to head with the Aliens without using their laserbeam. See how they use their other weaponry instead of shooting from afar killing every single Aliens instantly. On previous Predator installments there was always only one Predator. This time you see them work as a team hunting down their prey..... It doesn't mean that once you're a supreme being you can't get killed. If that's the case then might as well don't make a movie. The best part of this movie is seeing both supreme species battling all out for survival. Predators are just so powerful..... You could all blades and spears flying everywhere....

On the other hand, the Aliens multiplied so quickly in the movie. And that was one of the reason why Aliens fans were not too happy about it. Here's my view... why would we still want to wait for the Aliens to burst out from human chest???? It will be a waste of time doesn't it??? We all know it's gonna come out anyway and this is not the movie ALIEN anymore. It is not an introduction. We are here to see them fight. In order for them to fight, there must be a sufficient amount of Predators and Aliens.

Wow... the fighting scene in the end is so cool!!!!!..... I am sure AVP 2 will be better..... It is not the end yet!!!

When this DVD comes out that's it!! It's mine. I feel like buying few of the DVDs so it looks like I have AVP 1, 2, 3 and 4 and ........ He he!!! Yahoo!!!! Don't miss it!!!",1092700800,,3041,4.421428571428572

Both the Alien, and the Predator get good screen time, and they look believable.  This is far better than the last two Alien movies, and better than the second Predator movie.  It doesn't harm either franchise.  The story line is interesting, and kinda tells us where the Predator came from, or more directly, why they come to earth.  The movie is based on Earth, and in 2004, so no wierd planets this time around.  I guess there are some people who are not true fans of either franchise, and they may say the movie was a bust, but I would dissagree.  It's a good movie, with great effects and suspense.

1567198,4,B00005JMZK,"I have two reasons for giving the movie four stars instead of five.

1. The human characters are cliche and you just can't get to the point where you really care about them.

2. They messed with the Aliens life cycle a tad. In the original movie, it took a few hours from the time the facehugger attaches to someones face till the time they wake up, give another couple hours before the chestburster actually emerges.  Here, the whole process it greatly condensed.

But who cares? Most people going to see this movie don't really care about the humans. I doubt they'd care too terribly much about life cycle continuity. They want to see the Aliens and the Predators fighting it out to the end. And in that category, this film delivers quite nicely. The Aliens have never looked better. While the gore is toned down a tad for PG-13 (chest bursting in particular is more implied than shown), it doesn't get toned down in action in the least. It's definetly worth the ticket.",1092614400,2,972,4.568965517241379

1567200,4,B00005JMZK,"This movie was greatly anticipated by alien and predator fans alike. The blessed film in which they would finally square off. However, this movie is unfortunately not all it's hyped up to be. Although it IS action packed and it DOES have incredible special effects, the plot takes a STUPID STUPID STUPID twist halfway through the film. This movie is about a group of people with various different skills being sent to a pyramid in Antarctica that's 300 feet below the ground after a satellite reads a heat bloom in that area. However, once there, they realize the pyramid is a hunting ground for alien creatures(the predators) that have come to battle the aliens that they breed there through humans. It's a good plot, but halfway through, everything changes and suddenly you find it hard to say it doesn't defeat the purpose of the film. And as far as ""Alien Vs. Predator"" goes, although there are one or two battle scenes, most of the fights are between the predators and the humans or the humans and the aliens. And, to my GREAT GREAT GREAT disappointment, there WERE battle scenes, but there was nothing epic. There wasn't a single epic battle scene. And there are only 3 predators!!! Two of them get killed in the same battle against the SAME alien!!! This movie is VERY entertaining, however, which counters the holes in the ""alien versus predator"" theme of it. Though entertaining, it isn't always interesting. Especially when all but one human dies. I HATE the ""last person standing"" cliche SO MUCH!!! Had this movie been any less interesting, it wouldn't have gotten 4 stars, and had it not been as entertaining as it was, it probably wouldn't even have gotten 3 stars.

1567203,3,B00005JMZK,"I have to admit, after reading some of the existing reviews, I was anticipating AvP to be a real dog on the caliber of the infamous ""Wing Commander"" movie.  So, needless to say, my expectations had the bar pretty much buried in the ground.

So, why did I go see it then?  Well, I'd read the AvP novels - three of them if I recall correctly - and they were all very well written and captivating.  If the movie could capture even a wisp of the spirit of those books, then it might have a chance to redeem itself.  So, I committed to seeing it, again, expecting to lose 87 minutes of my life.

However, once the movie began, the plot was set up fairly quickly, and was very interesting.  I like the connection between Weyland's founder, Charles Bishop Weyland, and the Aliens' Bishop android.  One can rationally surmise how the later Weyland-Yutani corporation would create the Bishop android as a tribute to the company's creator.

Also of interest is the revelation of more Predator-Human-Alien mythology, and how it relates to the ancient civilizations of Earth.  Very fun stuff.  Although this back-story served its purpose, I was left wanting to know more.  One could easily envisage an entire Predator prequel based entirely in this historical era.

The main part of the storyline has received complaints about being too spartan, and those opinions are valid.  However, when a group of Humans gets stuck in the middle of an ancient Predator bug-hunt, inside a large, enclosed, isolated structure, what might you suppose the goal of said Humans would be?  I thought the plot made perfect sense, given the circumstances.

Finally, the way the main character, Alexa Woods, progresses, while it could have been done a bit better, a bit more clearly, was done adequately.  I didn't feel that one could accurately sense the turning point in Alexa's mind, when she made a certain choice, when she crossed the Rubicon from prey to hunter.  The drama and character development would have received a huge boost if that had been a bit better developed.  In any event, I loved how her recognition came - it was simple, yet meaningful, even if you saw it coming a mile away - very cool.

The biggest regret I had was a choice that the writers made at the end of the movie.  Instead of going with the direction that the AvP novels had taken, which I won't disclose for the sake of those that have yet to see the movie, a less compelling, more finite path was chosen.  If the more provocative choice had been made, then an entire franchise of AvP movies would have been made possible, with a leading lady possibly on par with Ellen Ripley, without having to invent a nonsensical tie between the sequels.

In summary, I rank this movie against the other Alien and Predator movies as follows:

1. Aliens
2. Predator
3. Alien
4. Alien vs. Predator
5. Predator 2
6. Alien 3
7. Alien Resurrection",1092614400,,2880,4.657425742574257
1567204,1,B00005JMZK,"don't know what you guys were watching but this movie sucked. It was stupid and lame 45 minutes of the movie wasted on character development of the humans. Hell most of them were goddamn pointless and did nothing worthwile they just died. They should have left the humans nameless there was no point for that much plot building.

The fight scenes were filmed badly. They were really disjointed and hard to watch most of the time with the damn shaky camera and the overuse of close ups. I wanted to see some epic fight scenes. I will admit the predator spearing the queen in the head was badass.

Also Paul Anderson ripped off way to much stuff from the original movie script written and sold in 1991 by Peter Briggs. Briggs used a lot of the comic to base the movie off of but it was 10 times better then the drivilous schnit we saw here. If any of you want to see what might have been and what should have been go to this link. [...]

The movie used lots of bad plot devices. Lots of Cookie Cutter horror movie technics and more. The classic split up and die bit etc. Anderson tried to make a good movie but instead we got this weak carnageless PG-13 alien vs predator which is a major dissapointment when compared with the stellar comic franchise. Superior video game especially the arcade game for it's sheer fun value.

Anderson had so much lore and ideas to draw on to give us a true clash of the species. However instead we see mediocore battle at best. The first 2 predators going down like utter chumps when there race has been doing this for centuries. The weak fight scenes and the stupid alliance at the end.

1567269,1,B00005JMZK,"Let's be honest. Paul W.S. ""Worthless Sh-t"" Anderson has proven time and time again that he is incapable of making a movie that could even remotely be considered good. Mortal Kombat was a bad joke. Event Horizon was a shameless gorefest with no redeeming features. Resident Evil makes ""Dawn of the Dead"" look like The English Patient. Why would AvP be an exception?

If I made a list of all the stupidities, contradictions, and illogics contained within this movie, I would be up all night and half of tomorrow. If I made a list of all this movie's good points, I'd have a blank piece of paper. Let's start with what I can think of off the top of my head:

1) Lance Henriksen, who played Bishop in Aliens, plays a human in this movie. What Paul Anderson forgot was that Lance also played Bishop's creator (a Human character) in Alien 3, at least 300 years into the future. Whoopsie! Oh sure, there are those who say Lance's character in Alien 3 was an android, but androids don't bleed red. Next.

2) During the mission briefing, there is talk of the pyramid containing elements from 3 different cultures. The premise is that the Egyptians, Cambodians, etc. learned things like written language from the predators. However, if this is the case, then why does the predator pyramid use 3 different Human languages instead of Humans using the predator language?

3) If a hunt gone awry is what wiped out the Aztecs, then presumably the Antarctic pyramid wouldn't have been the only one used for hunts, yet the Egyptian and Cambodian pyramids don't have any depictions of aliens or predators like the Antarctic one does.

4) Though the pyramid is buried under 2,000 feet of ice, it was apparently built on dirt, back when Antarctica was much warmer. But continents don't move thousands of miles in just a few thousand years. The last time that pyramid saw sky would have been millions of years before humans inhabited the planet.

5) The predators only come to Earth every 100 years? Well then, what the heck were Danny Glover and the Governator fighting against?

6) The predators come to Earth to hunt Aliens, and we're just chow for the critters? That also contradicts the past two Predator movies, in which the preds come to Earth to hunt Humans, not Aliens.

7) The Predators store their shoulder cannons inside the pyramid, but they bring all their other weapons with them from the ship. Not only does this not make sense, but it again contradicts the Predator films in which the Preds bring all of their weapons - shoulder cannons included - with them from their ships.

8) Sebastian says the Aztec calendar was metric, based on powers of ten. This is a big steaming cow patty. The Aztec calendar was actually based on 13 and 20. Of course, the bigger question is why you'd have to input the date at all to retrieve your weapons, when it would be much easier to just push a button.

9) The Queen lays egg after egg after egg. Where's all this bio-mass coming from? The Nostromo had food stores, Hadley's Hope and Fury 161 were certainly abundant feeding grounds, and the bugs on the Auriga were deliberately fed, but what are the pyramid aliens eating? Is there a giant tank of alien kibble inside the pyramid somewhere? If so, why do the Aliens bother venturing anywhere else?

10) There are more Aliens in this movie than there are hosts... heh heh...

11) The predators are supposed to bring hosts to the Sacrificial Chamber before the hunt can begin. Instead, they just enter the pyramid without bringing hosts. Paul Anderson tries to explain this contradiction away by saying that the heatplume was bait for the human expedition, but that contradicts the whole Sacrificial Chamber concept, and doesn't make sense because we wouldn't be able to detect said bait until today.

12) The Pyramid shifts every ten minutes. Except for the part where it shifts twice in the span of 3 minutes and doesn't shift at all for the second half of the movie.

13) The Queen, in order to get free from her restraints, has the warrior aliens bite lots of holes in her so her acid blood dissolves her restraints. But why doesn't she have the aliens impale themselves? And why does she wait so long to do this instead of doing it ASAP? And as soon as the Queen is set free, she decides to run out of and away from the pyramid, without any real reason. I dunno about you, but it seemed to me that she had a pretty cozy spot right where she was. The pyramid made a perfect hive and there was no shortage of food, so why would she leave?

14) The Preds' masks can see aliens inside the hosts. So why didn't they see the alien inside the surviving Pred that they brought aboard their ship? Seriously, if you were a pred and you wanted to bring a fellow pred on board your ship after he'd just spent a day in an alien hive, wouldn't you check him for implanted aliens first?

15) Speaking of the masks... if they can't stop an alien's inner jaw from ramming through your skull, why bother with masks at all? I can understand goggles for the vision modes, but you don't wear a full-blown helmet except for protection.

16) The time required for an Alien to grow into the next stage of its lifecycle is determined by whatever is most convenient from a storytelling perspective, rather than by any sort of precedent set by the other 4 Alien movies. For example, in Alien 1-4, there was at least a day in between implantation and ""birth"". In AvP, that time is anywhere from a day to 3 minutes. Another example: the fact that the eggs were all laid at least a few second apart from each other doesn't stop them from hatching all at the same time (Resurrection also had this problem, but at least in that movie it wasn't scripted).

And that's not counting all the other types of flaws, such as the overuse of CGI and the stark absence of character development. The second through fourth Alien movies all had deep psychological stuff that the characters (well, Ripley anyway) had to deal with. This movie has no depth, no substance, just senseless violence in between long stretches of boredom.

Basically, I expected Paul Anderson to produce yet another worthless waste of film, and that's exactly what he gave us. This is the last nail in the Alien saga's coffin. It's a shame that the franchise will end without any of its dignity left. As for the Predator movies... well, I do consider this to be the best of the Predator movies, so I suppose that is worthy of something.",1092614400,303,6452,4.570562770562771
1567270,2,B00005JMZK,"Oh so much unrealized potential in this movie.

The best elements of this film have been borrowed from better films.  The rest of the elements are copies of other crappy films.  That about sums it up.

Films like this don't have to be necessarily plausible, but they should be plausible within the context of the suspended disbelief we are asked to come to the theatre with.  This film again fails miserably.

Worst part?  The script.  It is just plain LAZY.  Lame dialogue executed by bored or undertalented actors.  You know INSTANTLY which characters will die because they either don't have names or they talk about how much they miss their kids.  In B-movie land, that is the kiss of death.  Lead actress Sanaa Lathan reads each line the same, and her acting range runs the gamut from A to, well, B.  Not entirely her fault, though.  Any moviegoer with any sense of narrative sense knows that the script and dialogue are weak, weak, weak.

Watch the movie and see how many moments or ideas you see that are stolen directly from other films:

""Armageddon"" and ""The X-Files movie"" are the primary theft victims.

20th Century Fox had YEARS to develop a decent screenplay and hire a decent director.  Apparently they chose to do neither.

I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  If you are just super gung-ho on seeing it just out of loyalty, a sense of completion, or morbid curiosity, then go ahead.

But you'll be sorry.

Okay, a couple of specifics so I don't just sound like I'm ranting for the sake of ranting:
 --The team of ""experts"" called in from across the globe to investigate..... wow, that's original.  And all of them are young and good looking (at least the central characters).  One of these experts can even decipher within moments, with stunning confidence and ease, an ancient heiroglyphic language that is a hybrid of three ancient cultures.  Good job, buddy.

---The sick, aging billionaire who appears at the top of the stairs and, with no prior introduction to the audience or the characters, launches into his fantastic story about how and why the ""dream team"" was assembled.  This is an oft-overused cliched movie moment, ain't it?  Answer - yes.

-- To hide the fact that it is too difficult to make fight scenes between the Aliens and the Predators look realistic, they shoot the scenes in extreme close-up and with rapid-fire editing so you never really get any kind of sense of space or size.  You just see 1/2 second glimpses of fists flying, weapons firing, and acid dripping.

-- The alien ship carrying the Predators comes closer to the Earth than the Moon is, launches a cutting beam and 3 Predator-carrying pods to the surface, and apparently no space agency or defense agency takes notice.  Just like ""Independence Day"" - remember how those big ships got so close to the Moon that Neil Armstrong's footprint in the dirt was vibrated into oblivion, and ONLY THEN did some lone yahoo at a super-high-tech observatory notice something?  I mean C'MON!  We can spot planets and asteroids hundreds of millions of miles away, but we can't spot alien ships until they are as close as the Moon?
That is simply another example of lazy, grade-school B-movie screenwriting.

I could go on and on, but you should get the drift by now.  I'm not claiming that ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" were based on actual events and thus beyond criticism for their liberties with plausibility.  But those two movies at least kept their foundation in CONTEXTUAL plausibility.

This ""AVP"" movie exists solely for the sake of pleasing the undemanding fan who just wants to see an Alien fight a Predator under any cirumstances filmable.

It had a really good story to combine these two science fiction creatures (unlike certain other VS. movies where there is no good story to combine two creatures together).  What I really enjoy about this movie is the that it dosn't need all the blood, guts and gore that it's predisesors needed to get it's message across.  That means that a wider range of fans can actually go and see this movie.

It is very cool to see my two favorite ""bad aliens"" fight it out for victory.

About the only downside I really have for this movie is that sometimes the action got a little to fast to get what is going on.  it would get a little difficult to know just who was attacking who.

A friend really wanted to see this movie, and as a film buff who does not discriminate against any film, I tagged alone. I found the movie to be entertaining and fun, but nothing special. In development for almost 14 years, ever since a skull from the title characters in the Alien film series appeared in the spaceship trophy room in Predator 2, this film has been highly anticipated ever since. The Alien Vs. Predator story has crossed over virtually all forms of media before becoming a feature film. There was a successful comic book series, toy line, multiple video games, sound track (of the PC game) and even a card series, so it was about time a screen version hit theaters. While the film was very enjoyable, I think the PG-13 rating hurt it quite a bit. There were moments of pure tension that were cut short with bad editing so as not to show any gore. I found that unneccessary and bothersome. A solid R rating would have benefited the film quite a bit and added to the tense atmosphere. Also, at 87 minutes, including credits, the film was a bit too short. I would have loved to see some backstory and more character development. Other than that, the film was a pretty decent entry in the Sci-Fi/Horror genre, fun and fast-paced, and makes me look forward to seeing the rest of the films in this ""prequel.""",1092528000,2,1403,4.463035019455253

There is no ominous build-up and pacing here that those movies feature so well -- this is an action movie with the single-minded purpose of pitting the Aliens and the Predators against each other, and the movie moves quickly to the inevitable confrontations.  The environment the hapless (human) protagonists find themselves in is unoriginal and only mildly interesting (we've already seen it in the Indiana Jones movies), and the overall movie has comic-book feel -- really, forget the ""storyline"" and simply enjoy the carnage and slow-motion shots that Mr. Anderson is so fond of.  Admittedly, the scene with the face-hugger in a slow-motion mid-leap was kind of nifty (the effect is reminiscent of the slow-motion bullit scene in the ridiculous and annoying ""Resident Evil"").  And damn, this is the best you'll see of the Aliens and Predators (the Aliens look absolutely fantastic, and are curiously adorable).

Most of the reviews you'll read about this movie will say that it wasn't as bad as everyone thought. But if everyone thought it was going to be bad, then why did everyone still go and see it? I suppose I am guilty of the same thing. Purely curiosity about what the story would be about and which of the 2 aliens is superior in a battle.

The challenge is how to explain to the audience why the 2 aliens are battling in the first place since neither species speaks. And in that aspect, the movie does an adequate job. Humans are just basically there to explain to us what's going on and provide host bodies for the 'Alien' so that a battle can begin.

It's quite a short movie if you go by time, but it wasn't that noticeable. A little slow in the beginning, but finishes strong. Conclusion: Great toys, great posters, not a bad movie.",1092528000,2,1039,4.457894736842105

1567321,3,B00005JMZK,"Two of the most recognizable outer space species collide in the film Alien vs Predator.  For years, fans of the two franchises have waited to see the two duke it out on the big screen.  Well, now, here's your chance, sort of.

The film opens with scientists discovering a pyramid that is buried deep below the Antarctic surface.  So, a team of specialists are gathered to pursue this lost treasure that is believed to be the first pyramid ever built.  What is believed to be an archeological find turns out to be a playground built for predators, inhabited by aliens.

After a few humans are picked off by aliens and predators separately, the two icons start to square off against each other.  Early on, it seems as if one will overpower the other, then, things turn around and it seems to be an even matchup.  Oh, and the humans help too.

This goes on for a little bit, then a climactic ending fight scene takes place.  Who will win?

For a movie that was supposed to bring two of the baddest icons that spanned three decades together, it wasn't all that great.  The fight scenes are really slow.  Yes, there are a few cool moments, but nothing spectacular.  Why?  Maybe it is because of the PG-13 rating.  Every Predator and Alien movie is rated R, so, let's make the battle PG-13.  Plus, there really isn't that much fighting in it anyways.  Most of it is quick anyways.

However, if anything, you can laugh the whole way through the movie.  This film is so cheesy that it makes it fun to watch.  There were so many moments that could make a person laugh and make jokes that made the film enjoyable.  I think fans of the two franchises will be dissapointed in the movie, but they will leave with a smile on their face.",1092528000,3,1722,4.434504792332269

The holes in the plot are so BIG one could drive a monster truck through them.  The predators with their cameleon-like ability to camoflage themselves demonstrate this ability in the beginning of the movie when they meet the humans in Antarctica.  Of course from the original ""Predator"" movie we know how these aliens love frigid weather.  The poor humans don't stand a chance.  Great ongoing dialogue:  eeee-ahhhh, with the final death thrust cut to preserve the PG13.  But wait, now the hatching aliens arrive on the scene.  These guys are bad news.  It becomes obvious they can compete with the predators.  So guess what happens?  The poor predators suddenly forget how to camoflage themselves for the rest of the movie. How convenient! Now that the predators have had this big mental lapse, Laura Croft Jr. must help the predators to save the world.  Thank goodness she is able to pick up a spear to kill the alien.  Did I say spear?  Yes, a spear.  If Ripley would have only had a spear in the original ""Aliens"" movie, it would have been a much shorter movie.  I might add that Lara Croft Jr. was so brilliant in retrieving a weapon the predators had buried in the tomb centuries earlier.  The stupid predators desperately need this weapon to fight the aliens.  They trail the poor humans throughout the temple, killing them to get this weapon.  What nonense! Why did they bury these key weapons in Antarctica? Why didn't they didn't have any duplicates or the ability to make them on their industrial sized space ship.  How can a sci-fi movie be this bad?  And get this, the predators frequently show off their x-ray vision throughout the early part of movie.  At the key point at the end of the movie when they find their predator comarade busted up in the snow after an encounter with an alien, they do not use their xray vision to look into him.  Why would they not do so to assess his wounds and injuries or even out of curiosity?  Oh they'd never expect that an alien might be inside, even after being involved in this ""right of passage"" battle for centuries.  It is only right that at the end of the movie, the grateful predators honor Lara Croft Jr for her aid, mount up in their giant New York city size spaceship and fly off into space - leaving Lara Croft Jr. at the totally destroyed Antarctic station in the middle of a sub-zero snow storm without a coat.  I'd like to suggest an alternative ending.  When Lara Croft Jr. encounters the nearly dead predator lying on the ice at the end of the movie, I think he should look up, snap open his forearm technology kit, press some buttons and start laughing.  Then he and the unlikeble herione could both be blown to smitherines (perhaps bringing down the spaceship above them) assuring their will not be another sequel.",1092528000,16,2911,4.623781676413255
1567324,3,B00005JMZK,"\This is one of the most anticipated movies in the entire Sic/Fi community, the battle between the galaxy's most ruthless hunter, and the universe most hideous and ferocious creature has finally made it to the silver screen.

Alien Vs Predator is movie that has had 14 years of back story, starting by our friends at the Dark Horse Comics creating the first AVP story shortly after Predator 2 was released. The script for the movie was written and rewritten over and over and over again, Fox Studio couldn't find a scripted that they liked, even though one was staring at them right in the face, Fox didn't wanted to use the original comic story (they probably didn't even know it existed). It wasn't until they got a scripted by Paul Anderson (of Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil) that they finally gave the project the green light.

The story the Anderson penned is that the Predators jump started human civilization by creating a cutler that is a mix of Mayan, Aztec, and ancient Cambodian on an island on Antarctica, There the Predators hold there Coming of Age Hunt of the Hard Meat (Predator name for the Aliens) which is done every hundred years.

Fast forward to 2004, a satellite for Weyland  Industries spots a heat boom on Antarctica, discovering a pyramid that is some 2000 feet below the ice. They send of team mixed of Drillers, archeologist, an ice climber, and a few muscle men to check it out.

Something already seems wrong when they find that some one else has drilled the hole for them, know drill a hole through very dense and old ice is no easy task, it would take several days with a hot drill bit to cut its way down two thousand feet, but over made that hole, at a perfect thirty degree angle, did it in less then a day.

They find the pyramid a few hours later, after snooping around for a bit, among their findings is a ""sacrificial chamber"", they also find this sarcophagus. When they open it up they find not a body, but three odd looking do-dads, they shrug there shoulders and pick the items up.

Suddenly the whole pyramid starts to rearrange itself, walls are shifting around and chambers are sealed off.

In the Sacrificial Chamber, the room is seal shut and suddenly all these nasty looking fleshy garbage can size eggs pop up through the floor.

Uh-oh

Crash Boom Bang, Ahhhh Ieeeek argh! What are of these nasty monsters, Hiss Snarl,

After the first thirty odd minutes, the remaining fifty are nothing but no stop action, raping facehuggers, gooy Xenomorphs, and native, linebacker like Predators, two of them are killed almost immediately, one from just bad luck as he was turned into a predator shisgabob, and they other because he didn't temper his weapons to deal with Aliens' acid blood.

Soon there is only one predator and one human left. Lex, the step in for Ripley, finds that she must team up with the monstrous, but no necessary evil predator, that includes giving back that little do-dad that turns out to be the predator's shoulder cannon.

AVP is a movie that has a lot of things going for it but there are several things that are fundamentally wrong with it, preventing it from becoming the #1 movie that is should be.

The biggest problem is that fox studio's abandon all of the comic concepts, they wanted to created an original story independent from all the other material. That is a huge mistake.

Many fans are harming his film for it's PG-13 rated instead of a more traditional blood splattering R. The rating really doesn't bother me at all. But like everyone else I was mad when I first heard about it. You don't make horror with Gore, you create discuss, unless all the gore in the movie is in one concentrated scene like in the chestburster scene in the first Alien.

It was too damn short; the result is that the action is too fast. But very intense good job there. Also the interval between the action is also too fast, giving the audience a non stop stream, giving no time for exposition, if there were at least fifteen more minutes it would be fine.

Another grip is the lack of character development, or what I should say is the misplace of character development, we learn some details about some characters that will be dead in the next seconds while there isn't any character development between Lex  and the Weyland characters.

I was satisfied with the blend of CGI and puppets, there was more animatronics then CGI.

In conclusion, this wasn't all that bad of the movie, it gave what sci/fi geeks like me wanted to see on the silver screen, alien and a predator duking it out. We got to see a Queen Alien spiriting across a snowy plain, and lots of jumping facehuggers.",1092528000,3,4642,4.596852300242131
1567325,5,B00005JMZK,"This film wasn't bad.  I was one of the sceptics, mad about the PG-13 rating...  (but dude, who cares?  i hear there's gonna be an R-rated directors cut anyways...)  but the film was fun stuff.  some nice moments that just put a synical smile on your face, some tense moments, pretty good effects...

I have to say, one of my few complaints with this movie, is the effects on the facehuggers...  When they were on people, they looked like crap!  The bottom halfs were like dangling, they weren't even touching the face of their victim, and the tail movement on them was just bad.  The full grown aliens and predators were pretty good lookin though.

One other complaint I have is that when the chick wakes up after having a face-hugger... the chestburster comes out of her like 3 seconds later...  In the other films, those things stayed in their host for way longer...

One other thing that sort-of bugged me, (but I warmed up to it) is the predator's style...  The spear and sheild he makes for her out of alien parts... and the marks out of their prey's blood...  It seemed kind of...  like...  african or native american.  And the fact that they teamed up in the end.  (Nobody tell my I spoiled that for you...  You knew it was coming...)  But oh well, that's just the predator's style...  (I'm an alien fan, obviously.)

But yeah, as far as living up to the first films...  It was way more of a predator film.  The music (which wasn't that great most times...) was more predator.  The atmosphere, the plot, stuff like that were all more like the predator films.  So if your a predator fan, (who doesnt enjoy the movies JUST because predator skins people) I don't see why you wouldn't like this one.

But if your an alien fan, (like me), you might not be as happy...

I think it might be because the studio edited it, but every time an alien killed somebody, it got kinda choppy...  It was kinda cheesy.  I laughed at every human death by an alien because it was a little lame...  But the R-rated dvd might change that.

People say nothing happens until an hour into the film...  Yeah, I guess they mean between aliens and predator...  'Cause like half of our crew dies pretty early on...  I managed to stay entertained the whole way through.  This is a good movie and it doesn't deserve the crap people are giving it.

-If you don't wanna be totally in the dark you should ATLEAST watch Predator, Alien, Aliens, and Alien3.  ...Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection don't really have much purpose to them, in terms of getting to know the species...  (Plus Ressurection kinda sucks...)",1092528000,2,2585,4.5249457700650755

I went in to the movie sceptic. PG-13? How can they do an Alien/Predator movie without the R-rated violence?

I'll tell you what though, this movie was engrossing from beginning to end. The violence is there, but it's mostly Alien and Predator violence and it was very sharply done. Frightening. Fast. The violence was done in the tradition of old style hollywood and was very effectively done with sound effects.

The story is well thought out and gives a marvelous new look inside the world of the Predator!! Where they came from. What they're about. Successfully blending their world with the Aliens and demanding your attention as the events unfold between the two sides and the unexpecting humans in the middle.

I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who has seen the Alien or Predator movies. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't. I left the movie theatre smiling and talking. Also, knowing a little more about Bishop (the andriod from ALIENS).

1567407,3,B00005JMZK,"Overall, I liked the movie. I thought the plot was a bit cheesy. I'm glad they didn't over-do the fight scenes, because it was starting to look like Mortal Combat for a minute in that first fight scene. Alien movies have a tradition of featuring a strong female protagonist, so I'm not going to touch the black female in charge.

Sensitive Predators? Again, a little cheesy, but they made it work. It was a just a little too Hollywood for me, but all I wanted to see was some alien fighting and they delivered it. I wouldn't say it's a great movie, but I had fun and it was worth watching.

Oh, and the Predators and aliens were great looking. The special effects were top notch. Although, this film is set in present times just like the other Predator movies... so they really should have sought to make the predators look exactly like they did in those movies.

Unfortunately, the script took a huge backseat to special effects in this movie and it's full of Hollywood clichs.

Film clichs in AVP:

Person jumps across gorge and barely makes it to the other side. Rocks give way and the person starts to fall, but a hero lunges over and grabs their arm just in the nick of time. This must be in hundreds of movies and I don't even think it's possible.

A bomb is getting ready to detonate, the clock counts down and the protagonist has only seconds to escape. He runs as fast as he can and jumps at the last minute... just barely escaping the blast. Alien vs. Predator ripped this off of the first predator with Ahnold.

The heroes are in an ancient tomb filled with amazingly advanced booby-traps and hidden levers. They accidentally touch the wrong thing and a huge rock slab starts to close potentially trapping them inside. The heroes dive through the small opening just barely making it through. This is a rip-off of Indiana Jones which may be a rip-off of something else for all I know.

The fearless leader in charge that doesn't take no for an answer and always knows what's best for everyone else. They don't take any guff from anyone and never back down. They're always saying things like ""You hired me for the job and I'm in charge, now do what I say... follow me!"".

People getting thrown through walls during fight scenes. How many times have you seen two adversaries in movies fighting with one of them pinned on the ground. Then the person on the bottom kicks the other one off of him and through a wall.

An adventurous mission in a far-off place that is dangerous and requires a team of the best [fill in the blank] in the world. This team is briefed on the mission and then flown by helicopter to the mission site. The main hero is usually reluctant and has some conditions. Again, a rip off of the first Predator.

That's just what I can think of off the top of my head. It's like these Hollywood execs, just go to Blockbuster and rent some movies to get their ideas. Although I enjoyed watching AVP, it's really just a bunch of scenes from Alien and Predator movies, with a flimsy plot, and some film clichs mixed in.",1092441600,,3039,4.447841726618705

A TROPHY!!!  the preadator's purpose is (and stop me if i am wrong.  i have been known to be from time to time) to go to other planets and do battle with alien beings.  if the alien being loses the predator takes that creatures skull as a trophy.  in the predators last encounter with humans the humans won.  i would presume the predator handed the pistol to dan glover's character as a sign of respect saying in essence ""you are the better man.  i yield to you.  following this line of reasoning it is logical to assume that the predator deems the human race a worthy species, perhaps on par with the predator (at least in the combat department) and is worth saving.  the aliens not forming an alliance with humans?  not surprising.  the aliens have no reguard for life of any sort, including their own (remember the drones killing one of their own for acid to burn their way out of a containment chamber in ""resurection"")  in anycase i firmly believe, based on the ending of ""predator 2"" that a Predator/Human alliance is possible...  anyone who differs from my opinion can feel free to email me.",1092441600,3,1568,4.619565217391305

Throughout the whole movie it was like who just died?  WHo's that guy?  Just badly written.  That and they just killed the people off soo quickly and somehow the aliens bred inside the humans in under two minutes whihc made no sense if you've seen the Alien movies.  The worst part of this movie is this speech the main character (some black chick whos name i cant remember) whips out this whole like speech as to how to survive which she could've never just thought up liek that.  Then for some reason the Predators band with the chick and don't just kill her?  (i still don't know why) and they help her get out.  Of course it all ends in perfect sequel setup fashion whihc i won't reveal cuz god knows ill get hate mail

1567412,4,B00005JMZK,"Everybody knew that after the success of Freddy vs Jason, there would other franchise that would come together. Alien vs Predator was also another long awaited rumored battles that would appear on the big screen and now it here. I just saw this I was satisfied with what I saw. I cannot believe many people trashed this movie. This movie was just what I had expected, maybe even a little better. It's both cool and kind of stupid. The fighting scenes were brilliant and the comedy was dumb yet enjoyable. I know many people had very low expectations of the film due to its PG-13 rating especially when all the Alien and Predator films are rated R but that should not ruin the entire movie for you. Just look past that and you find this to be a an enjoyable movie. I had waiting for this film very anxiously after Freddy vs Jason was released. It's not as good as F vs J but it is still good. Being a fan of the Predator series but never have seen any of the alien films, I did not know what could possibly happen from the aliens. All I was doing was routing for the Predator and wondering what the alien does. After seeing this film, I am definitely considering to rent all of the movies now. Anyway here is the plot.

A satellite has found an underground pyramid buried 2000 feet below Antarctica. The company that owns that satellite hires a group of Archeologist from around the world to explore the Pyramid. The team explores and discovers some fascinating clues, that this pyramid may have been the first Pyramid ever created because it has hieroglyphics (signs) from Egyptian, Aztec, and all different kinds of tribes. What the team doesn't know is that this isn't any normal period. This pyramid served a purpose, there was a certain reason that this pyramid existed and the team was about to find out in a very gruesome way. While their exploring, deep down in the pyramid' something is growing and is ready to come out. That something is the aliens and their using the team of archeologists to grow inside of. And if that is not enough, something from far away has come to hunt it. That something is the Predators. The pyramid was built so a battle can take place. The aliens are going to battle the Predators and the humans are right in the middle of it.

So that is the basic story line of the movie. What I really found really interest was the purpose of the battle. You cannot just have 2 bad guys fight; there must be a reason. In Freddy vs Jason, the reason was b/c Freddy had to kill Jason because Jason was killing all the kids on Elm Street before Freddy can kill anybody. Jason was hogging up all the fun. In AVP, it happens to be a ritual for the Predators to come to Earth to hunt the Aliens. They come every 100 years and use humans to help bring the Aliens to Life so can hunt the Aliens.

However the reason why this film loses one star is for 2 many reasons, why did the Predators come to Earth in the first 2 films if they come every 100 years. The first 2 films take place before this one and neither of them take place 100 years ago. AVP sort of makes the first 2 Predator films seem pointless. The other reason why it loses one star is because towards the end of the film, the predator becomes the ""good guy"" like how Jason did in F vs J. The predator is without any doubt a vicious hunter who once kicked Arnold Schwarzenneger's @$$ and he all of sudden turns good. That was dumb. Other then that, this movie was good. The fight scenes between the aliens and the Predators were done really well and seeing all Predator weapons was cool. I think if you give AVP a chance you'll like it.",1092441600,11,3615,4.336779911373707

I just didn't think that was right at all. but I loved the action parts of the Alien and the Predator. The CGI on this entire movie was great. I thought that it was a great movie. I expecially enjoyed the fact that they really let the Queen Alien move around a LOT more than she ever has in the past. AVP was definitly a great film.

1567415,2,B00005JMZK,"2/5  Alien Vs. Predator

Take two well-known sci-fi franchises and merge them into a film in such a way that you can be assured of a huge audience, but also, that the sum is greater than the parts.  Or as great.  This film isn't it.  Alien Vs. Predator is a cold, calculated ""product"" that is too contrived and formulaic to provide much intrigue or entertainment value.  And the most amount of suspense is provided courtesy of a penguin.

A corporate satellite, searching for evidence of natural resources, detects a significant amount of heat coming from an island in Antarctica.  The billionaire head of the company quickly hobbles together an expedition team to investigate what appears to be a pyramid with Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian traits, located 2000 feet below the surface.

The pyramid contains walls and floors that shift every ten minutes and hieroglyphics that are interpreted by one of the crew, to give them some sense of what they have found.  The maze provides so much overkill that an Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider fan would blush. The humans get into the maze, the face huggers do their thing and you have a nice population of Aliens for the Predators to hunt.

It takes one human to ""birth"" an Alien, so why are there so many Aliens in the place?  The gestation period took hours in the first Alien film, but here they seem to pop out with greater frequency.  The dialogue appears to be written by a 6th-grader.  There are no outstanding characters in the film, like a Ripley from the Alien series, although they try to create one in ""Lex"" Woods, played by Sanaa Lathan.  There's virtually no character development, so when they get killed, you don't feel anything.  Lance Henriksen plays the billionaire.  In one scene, he briefly does the ""knife"" trick from the Aliens film, where he played a ""synthetic human.""

This film is an empty-calorie spectacle that doesn't satisfy, yet it promises too much potential for fans of either series to pass up.  At least we find out who taught humans how to build pyramids.

1567467,4,B00005JMZK,"Despite being rated PG-13, his movie managaes to maintain a decent level of violent action and gore... and that's a good thing. Anyone who is familiar with Paul Anderson (director of Event Horizon, Soldier, Mortal Kombat, and Resident Evil) should be aware that there will be the trademark ""cheesy"" parts, but if you can look past those moments, the movie isn't half bad.

The cast is rather stiff and forgetable but who cares? Are you there to see the humans? No. The story is good and well laid out though it's delivered rather quickly. Things are thrown at you all at once and some events happen much faster than they should (example: the aliens grow from facehugger to chestburster to adult alien in what seems like five minutes!). The action is nice (once it starts) but I agree with those who stated that there should have been more scenes between the Alien and the Predator. I was also surprised how fast 2 of the 3 predators were killed.

The scene where the leading lady and the remaining predator ""team up"" was hard even for me to stomach (being the rabid fan that I am of these two franchises), but if you know the AvP comic books and you allow the filmmakers to take liberty on the ending of Predator 2 you'll see that the alliance isn't all that far-fetched. The queen alien was awesome! It was great to see her in CGI able to really stretch her legs out and get some full bodied screen time. In fact, all the of the CGI scenes were well done.

All in all, it was an entertaining film. Don't look for substance, don't look for meaning... it's Alien vs. Predator for crying out loud! Suspend disbelief, find humor when you can and enjoy the rest... and hope for a sequel!",1092441600,2,1683,4.47557003257329

1567469,4,B00005JMZK,"Now here's a movie with an impressive pedigree. Alien and Aliens exemplified the horror/sci-fi genre of the late 70's through the 80's. Predator and Predator 2 dropped a healthy dose of testosterone, beer-guzzling machismo into the meatgrinder, and coincidentally launced the idea of a Predator vs. Alien movie in the first place with Danny Glover's historic visit to the Predator's trophy room.

I watched the movie last night. I honestly expected it to bite. I really, really did. You expect this kind of thing when you see Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, and you wonder how much abuse your favorite silver screen baddies can continue to take. With this mindset I sat in the theater and watched. Boy was I surprised!

You can tell that the writers (including Dan O'Bannon, who helped pen the original ""Alien"") were desperately looking for some way to get the titular characters together. The plot revolves around Charles Bishop Weyland's discovery of a vast pyramid buried under 2000 feet of ice in Antarctica, and so he and a group of scientists go to investigate. Turns out that their discovery of the site is a lure to have them get impregnated by Aliens, which are kept in cold storage at the bottom of the structure. The pyramid is a conglomeration of Aztec/Egyptian/Cambodian architecture, and the archeologists they bring along can conveniently translate the all-too-vague clues of what they're getting themselves into.

The group predictably separates to explore and the gory antics begin. The pyramid ""shapeshifts"" every 10 minutes making new passageways and closing off exits at the same time...it's rather odd to explain. The characters themselves are surprisingly likeable, there were a few who I kept my fingers crossed for for no other reason than the writers took time to give them more human aspects. That said when a human bit the dust I felt bad. This is a major turnaround from Alien Resurrection where death was just part of the gory fun and it's nice to get the series back to it's roots.

The part of course that everyone wishes to know about is the rampage between the Predators and the Aliens. I have nothing to say but ""WOW!"". The fight correography was a bit jumpy for my taste, but make no mistake, to see the two finally fight on the big screen alone is worth the price of admission. My brother and I watched in the back row and the theater was totally silent, save for one person's awed whisper of ""Whoa"". I'm not joking. The movie will put you on edge with the action...I was half out of my seat.

Of course being an Alien/Predator purist there were some points I took note of that don't *exactly* measure up to what we all know. For starters the gestation period of the Xenomorphs in this movie is unbelievably fast. My brother and I looked at each other a little stunned that it could happen in about an hour as portrayed on screen, where in previous movies from ""impregnation"" to ""birth"" the process could take a couple of weeks depending on the state of the victim. Also, a Predator would *never* attack unarmed prey, it's against it's code. Bear in mind this didn't happen in the movie, however twice it seemed that a Predator was about to blast an unarmed human, and it didn't feel right. Viewing the overall whole I understand that these plot points were necessary evils to make the story work within a 2 hour time frame, so I let it slide.

I may be biased here, but I found the last 20-25 minutes of the movie as it's shining moment. As a mild spoiler, it may seem impossible, but it was still very cool watching a human armed with an Alien head shield (yes, I'm serious) and an Alien tail spear (again, yes I'm serious) teamed up with a Predator and working together to get the heck out of Dodge. As the Italian archaeolgist in the film says, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"".

The writers have obviously worked quite hard to make a rather thin plot work. My hat's off to them. This was a hard feat to pull off since almost every other avenue has been effectively blocked off by the last two Alien films. Kudos! Alien/Predator fans will like this movie, although I think Pred fans will like it a hair more.",1092441600,2,4153,4.634510869565218
1567470,1,B00005JMZK,"The is insult to every alien and Predator every made. You do not I repeat do not make a movie pg-13, when every other movie in the series is rated R.  Its just a insult, boycott this movie and fox (who made it) because of this tragedy.",1092441600,5,235,4.0
1567471,5,B00005JMZK,"Listen, I've read enough of these terrible reviews of this movie, and I think I need to explain a few things, because apparently none of you have seen the original Alien or Predator movies.  I watched it twice last night, so I picked up on a lot of stuff.  So if you haven't seen Alien Vs. Predator yet, you might not want to read this.

First of all, this movie does not have a terrible story line, and if any of you thought a little bit about it, you'd realize that it works with the previous Alien movies.  Lance Henrickson plays the owner of the whole Weyland company.  All the reviewers have made it very clear that they know Lance played Bishop in Aliens.  So lets sort together the smaller details.  First just the little jokes and things that the filmmakers put into this movie as tribute to Bishop.  When they're on the helicopter on the way to the ship, the magazine has a picture of Weyland, and part of the headline says ""Bishop.""  Also, when they are on the ship and Weyland is by himself looking at the computer layout of the temple, he takes his pen and does a tribute to his knife trick from Aliens.  Also in this movie, they effectively reuse classic lines from the old Predator and Alien movies.

Now for those of you who think that this movie's storyline doesn't work with the old Alien movies, think of this.  Weyland Corporation is the company that funds all of Ripley's trips in the future.  So obviously the one survivor of the present time in Alien Vs. Predator goes and complains to Weyland Corporation, and of course Weyland Corporation goes off to  ""build better worlds,"" and find one of these species of aliens (either the Alien or Predator).  So Ripley's team comes across the Aliens first, and things progress from there.

Now there is a very obvious connection between Lance Henrickson character of Mr. Weyland in AVP, and Bishop.  At the end of Alien 3, just before Ripley jumps into the lava stuff, Bishop (looking really healthy), appears out of nowhere.  But then we find out it isn't Bishop, but actually the person Bishop was modelled after.  This guy is (if I remember correctly), the current owner of Weyland Corporation.  So obviously Mr. Weyland was cloned after he died in AVP, or the guy played by Lance Henrickson in Alien 3 is a grandson or great grandson or whatever.  Anyway, that's enough about the storyline.

The fighting was just awesome, and the computer graphics weren't overdone.  I know everyone is sick of the Matrix slow-motion-spinning-camera effect, but they used it well in the ONE scene in the movie, so I don't see why people are complaining about that.  Although I thought they could have done a better job on the queen and on the predator's unmasked face, it wasn't all that bad.  And the ending is just what it should have been.  Overall, I have no major complaints about this movie.  Oh, and the PG-13 rating didn't make the movie worse.  So there was a little less human blood than in a Predator movie... it was still a great movie.",1092441600,8,2999,4.5655430711610485
1567472,3,B00005JMZK,"This movie demonstrates why dialogue is a necessity.  When you have two successful franchises going head to head as you do with ALIEN vs. PREDATOR, it would be nice if one of them could speak.  The element that made last year's FREDDY vs JASON so successful was humor, and Robert Englund's masterful banter with his dimwitted nemesis.  Though A and P are worthy opponents, neither speaks.  Dialogue is left to the dullard humans populating this film.  Of course, their only purpose in this slugfest is to provide hosts for the incubating Alien larva.  Just when you begin to warm to a character, he or she is bloodily slaughtered.

Perhaps if Sigourney Weaver's Ripley had been injected into this mess somehow the thrills would have been more enthralling.  Lance Henrickson is the only holdover from the early Alien entries, but he is barely the shell of Bishop in A2. If he has a connection to the earlier films here it goes unexplained. Here he plays multi billionaire Weyland, who quickly assembles a team to explore a recently explored pyramid 2,000 feet below the southern polar cap.  Once there, the humans quickly find themselves mere incubators for the Aliens.

Enter the Predators.  After killing the humans the Aliens miss, they set to killing the A's in a perpetually shifting pyramid.  The A's are clearly outmatched as the P's have brains to match their brawn and weaponry.  When the sole human survivor, a dedicated ice climber, manages to save a P while dispatching an A, she wins the respect of P.  Of course, as the only surviving human, the dialogue takes a quick nosedive.

The remainder of the movie consists of an FX extravaganza, with the final showdown coming between P and the mother A.  A is abolished to the frigid depths of the Antarctic ocean and P is impaled by A's stinger in the last seconds of fighting.  Only our heroine is left standing.  She is honored by the departing P's.  Earth is safe--until the sequel.

Though previous entries were rated R, this one is PG-13, and is not all that frightening or intense.  All violence is FX generated and not too gory for early teens.",1092441600,2,2109,4.739010989010989

Anderson direct this god-awful movie. I don't know where to begin but i will start with the setting of the movie. Antartica give me a break! Predator only lives in hot climate, i mean common a jungle, Los angelas. The acting was pretty horrible, im just upset they put Lance Henriksen in this movie becuase he was probably the only good actor, and of course he dies off half way through the movie. Anyway besides the corny so-called ""emotional scenes"", which displays terrible acting by sanna lathan, she becomes friends with the predator!!! Since when does predator become friendly!!! He makes her weapons too, unreal!!! All we needed was a love scene. it pretty much went down hill from there. Another thing which makes me angry is the make up effects, predator looks to human, they make him run with Sanna lathan, they were almost holding hands for godsakes!!! Way tooo much computer graphics. I didn't come into the theaters with high expectations but i mean give me a break this was complete garbage. Another thing, if your gonna make a movie with two sci-fi icons like alien and predator don't make the film pg-13. Big mistake! Alien and predator are sussposed to be extremely violent. My Whole review sums up that i Hate Hollywood and i hate how untalented directors are just remaking movies, and trying to make money by using stupid titles like ALien vs. Predator. I also hate Fox studios for ruining Americas two sweet sci-fi icons. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sigourney Weaver must be very upset. the only reason why i am glad this movie was made is so they could make a special edition dvd out of the original predator.

1567474,3,B00005JMZK,"There is an old saying common to many cultures, ""be careful what you wish you or you will get it."" Many of the cynics running hither and fro with their ""Rogert Ebert"" hats on tend to pre-diss these films before they ever arrive. This merely adds fuel to the fire -- Hollywood has enough trouble with sequels entirely on its own without having to navigate within the confines of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Which brings us full circle to AVP. Spiderman II it is not. In fact it is not even Superman II (in many ways better than the first) but it is a reasonable exercise in trying to revive the dual franchises, and it surpasses ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" within the first 10 seconds (but so do the promos for Joan of Arcadia). The Antarctica stuff, sneered at by reviewers, is worth a second look. There is actual a lot of science buried in that oddball plot arc. On the plus side, the animation and grisly tone work well. Viewers with shadow-syndrome claustrophobia will `get it' right away. On the other hand, the film falls into the ""Grade C Sci-Fi Lighting"" category which means it `way too dark; the direction into the ""Too Clever By Half"" category, which means the action scenes are `way too fast' and the ending into the ""One Riff Too Many"" category, which means that, in the very best Monty Python tradition, you will be ""pining"" for Sigourney Weaver by the film's end.",1092441600,,1369,4.569105691056911

Anderson for participating!  I really hope someone can get me an application before the end of this year so I can apply, because when you see a studio and a director set the bar this low, how the hell can you fail?

I can't believe 20th Century Fox spent over $70 million on a film that effectively destroys two of the greatest monsters ever to grace the silver screen.  What's worse, I can't believe I spent $10 to see it in the theater on opening night.  If you're looking for a movie in which the Predators (which look like they're suffering from Down syndrome thanks to the special effects team under Paul W.S. Anderson's guidance) battle the worst CGI Aliens ever conceived on film...then this movie is for you.

It's pretty obvious that neither Paul W.S. Anderson nor any of the studio executives involved in the making of this film have a handle on story in this laughable movie (and I'm not kidding...during the screening, the audience broke out in unintentional laughter several times over the stupidity of the plot).  The movie starts off with great possibilities.  Lance Hendrickson is fantastic in his short-lived role as the dying leader of an expedition that finds an ancient pyramid buried under the ice.  And the elimination of the investigating team by aliens and predators, as well as some of the battles that follow, is fantastic.

But the movie quickly takes a turn for the worse...a common ailment in all of Anderson's films.

When the surviving teenage Predator and the movie's only remaining human character (our heroine), played by Sanaa Lathan, become ""friends"" and he fashions a warrior's outfit out of the hide of a dead alien for our her, the movie was over for everyone in the theater.

Speaking of which...do you remember the original Predator?  Do you remember how big the predator was when it was battling Arnold Schwarzeneger?  Well, evidently these predators are suffering from some alien form of stunted growth or Sanna Lathan is a giant of a woman.  In the final scenes where Sanaa runs side-by-side with a predator, she is about the same size as the mighty hunter.

The film is filled with ridiculous moments and some of the worst clich dialogue ever uttered.  20th Century Fox should be firing executives over.

Aliens Vs. Predator.  ""Whoever wins, we lose.""  Just a clever tag line?  Make no mistake...it's the newest studio gimmick:  truthful advertising!  This is one to be avoided.

1567528,5,B00005JMZK,"Just when I thought both the Alien and Predator Sagas were over, Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil) rolls out yet another film for each of these legendary series.  When I first heard Paul Anderson, the man responsible for the mediocre Mortal Kombat, based on the excellent slasher-fighter game, I was a little apprehensive.  After months of waiting and waiting for this film it finally came out and was I ever excited.  AVP marked the triumphant return of the Predator creature to the silver screen as well as its sinister counterpart, the Alien.  I was so worried that Anderson would screw this up so bad, but hell was I wrong.  He used both elements from the PC game (the updated Predator targeting system designed to seek and destroy Aliens) and the comics (the method in which the Predators symbolically scar themselves with the acid blood).  I was also truly interested in the new look of the franchise(s)which constantly evolve with each new director and each new target audience.  The choice of how to portray the title characters was also beautifully done as the special effects team at Amalgamated Studios decided to stay away as much as possible from using all computer effects shots to portray these amazing movie monsters.  They wanted to keep it as real as possible by using mostly animatronics and people in costumes.  The acting was stellar and the female lead portraying Alexa Woods, reminded me of a young Sigorney Weaver from the first Alien film.  Lance Henriksen also returned to the Alien/Predator series as Charles Bishop Weyland, the founder of Weyland-Yutani Industries and the inspiration of the Bishop androids since in Aliens and Alien 3;(in which he also returns as Charles Weyland Jr.).  Only in extreme cases (the finale of the film [SHHHHH!] and deaths)were computer effects used, but this transition from real to animated was virtually seamless.  H.R. Giger, Stan Winston, Ridley Scott, David Giler, Walter Hill, Dan O' Bannon, Ron Shusett, James Cameron and various others who brought the alien and Predator stories to life would be very proud of the new look of the Alien (Classic Black with the see-through head and the flare of Alien Resurrection [reptilian tri-jointed legs and alligator-like tail]) and of course, the Predator monster (chrome finished armor [helmets (some custom designs) and plate armor] and weapons [including harpoons and throwing discs] the classic plasmacaster and the projectile disc with a new look; the face of the Predator was relatively different [still one ugly motherf***er!!]as it was animated differently and had green eyes as opposed to the brown or black eyes of the previous two Predator films; it still had dreadlock-like appendages on its head and it was still pretty buff looking).  More or less these changes were improvements over previous incarnations of the monster and they appeared more frightening than ever before.  Next to the Star Wars films of George Lucas, these films are some of the most best of all time.  They feature revolutionary special effects, beautifully mastered musical scores, amazing sets, and compelling stories.  Whether you call it Alien 5 or Predator 3, Alien Versus Predator is an instant classic of 2004 up there with Spider-Man 2 and Shrek 2, sequels to already blockbuster films.  Hopefully AVP has created a new interest in both classic film series and hopefully talented and youthful directors, writers, artists, and filmographers crank out another Alien and/or Predator film in the next five years.  As far as I'm concerned, the epic story of Alien and Predator relationship is far from over and the ending is proof of that! (Hint! Hint!)  GO SEE ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR!!!  IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! 10/10",1092355200,2,3732,5.076923076923077
1567529,2,B00005JMZK,"Recently I had the chance to see the long awaited AVP movie, and of course, so did a lot of other anxious fans that were fortunate enough to make it early Thursday evening to catch the special sneak preview screening. The film takes place on a deserted whaling site on an island off the Antarctic where a pyramid trapped two thousand feet under the ice begins to emit a heat signature that captures the attention of Weyland Industries. Enter, an exploration crew that comes to claim first dibs on what could be the greatest find in the history of archaeology and perhaps, humanity. What they don't know, is that it's not just the old remains of three lost civilizations, but an active hunting ground where teenage predators regularly (or rather every 100 years) gather to attain their right of passage as adults. Trouble arises when the hapless group of humans poke their noses around and start pushing buttons and activating god knows what, and though it sucks to be them, we can't wait for the chaos to start, and oh, is there chaos.

Now, of course, no one should expect this to be a perfect movie, because the franchise is a combination of two that often cater to different tastes, unless you're impartial and enjoy both equally. If you're more partial to the Alien series, your preference could ultimately differ with the film style of the Predator, but don't expect either. Paul Anderson managed to implement his own style and imprint very well. In fact, the 1 hour and 27 minute film is vastly entertaining the first hour, but unfortunately, fails to hold together as the turning point in the end may anger some, and baffle others, but if you're a still a freshman in the world of AVP, then you might just have a good time.

Though I hoped so, I would advise that viewers do not expect the claustrophobia of Alien, or the grittiness of Aliens, the environment actually goes more in a Predator line of set design as we find ourselves more in larger zones and bigger rooms which makes sense because it invokes the paranoia that goes with an invisible predator. The Aliens have had a huge makeover, which works to the film's benefit, so at least it doesn't look like a cardboard cutout via Alien 3. The characters are a hybrid of both movies which is nice, so we have our baffled non-violent scientists, and our gun wielding military badasses. The pacing style moves so that there's a lot of death within a short period of time (also another Predator movie trait), and they're actually enjoyable to watch (if that doesn't make me sound crazy), plus of course it's a rather short movie, but Paul Anderson is able to include everything needed to start a great movie with character development, storyline setup, and timing (both comedic and dramatic). The only problem is that I hoped it would be in its purity, an ""Event Horizon"" Paul Anderson, and not a ""Resident Evil"" Paul Anderson. We get both and unfortunately could've done without the slow motion and stop framing in certain parts for the visual appeal. It hardly contributes to any dramatic feel for the movie.

And right when the movie gets really good, like it's going to get better, Paul begins to stop and turn the film around into something else. No longer is it a fear fest or a plain action film, but some sort of joke only a lame fan-fiction could employ that was meant to make Alexa Woods (the main character) into a sort of Ripley (not a hero, but forced to be), and though it could've been done better, most people will find the scenes where she needs to fight rather humorous.

Visually-3/5
Just comes to show, that when you have a Predator/Alien hybrid, there's going to be some sort of mixup. Not fear inducing set wise, but impressive indeed, and it works well, though I had more expectations. The reference to the first Alien in the beginning (if you catch it) will give you a giggle. Biggest problem here was lack of gore, which was definitely left out on purpose since PG-13 movies get a bigger share on ticket sales, but that's the studio's fault.

Dialogue-3.5/5
It's nothing great, but it works out, though there are some moments where someone has to stop and say something cliche. I almost expected the regular ""It's quiet"" ""Too Quiet"" thing, but I'm glad it didn't happen.

Storyline and Scripting-3/5
It's a great premise that takes from both genres faithfully, but the script itself just wusses out towards the end. We don't get a spectacular fight like when Sigourney had to fight the Queen with a manual robotic loading vehicle, or when Arnold hunted the Predator in the woods. It's more of something you would expect to please younger Matrix Action oriented audiences, so you can interpret that anyway you want, but to me, it's a definite negative and it takes away from the character's credential.

Ending-1/5
Why? Maybe I should expect it, but man, oh man, if the ending were different (and maybe the fights were longer), and I don't mean the conclusion, I mean everything that leads up to it, this would definitely be a 4-5 star movie.

Overall
Tolerable. Not great, not bad, but I would recommend you see it once at least, as long as you don't have crazy expectations or hope it'll be a Ridley Scott, James Cameron, or a John McTiernan. It's strictly Paul Anderson, so if you're open to his interpretation of the series, you might be pleased, or you might not be.",1092355200,4,5355,4.659259259259259
1567530,4,B00005JMZK,"I went into this only having seen a trailer and of course all the related movies. I feared the following: A non-famous cast except for a typecast Lance Heriksen (Millenium, Aliens, Alien 3). It had a multi-sequel, next generation feel to it. Like Freddy vs. Jason or the spoof-like Jason movie where he turns up on a space station full of pretty twenty-somethings. I couldn't imagine an interesting scenario in which the two species battle that wasn't contrived or reaching like some of the related comic books and video games I've seen relating to this subject. Let me tell you, I was wrong about all that and to top it off, the special effects were far better than any of the preceding movies had. My hat goes off to the people who make CGI look like it wasn't CGI. The circumstances that bring everyone together is actually very compelling. Lance is showing his age but is effective. The action never seems to stop until the last moment and the ""facelift"" that the creatures received is an appropriate upgrade that doesn't stray from the classics. That's the films only problem. It's not the classic original Alien or Aliens (which I prefer to the Predator series). The drive remains the same: The Predator taking risks to find a worthy combatant. The parasite Alien hiding far below the surface for many years if necessary just to further its race. Unlike some scenes in Alien 3 that were so dark you couldn't tell what was going on, this was one was well lit despite being in a tomb most of the time. I really enjoyed it.",1092355200,,1526,4.613970588235294
1567531,5,B00005JMZK,"Before i went to see this movie i browsed throu alot of reviews and about 99% were absolutly terrible. I was really depressed i had been waiting for this movie for so long and I felt like kicking Paul WS Anderson in the nuts real hard. So I almost didn't go to see the movie, i ended up going and boy am I glad I DID! The movie was awesome...a couple of things didn't make sens thou like how come predators hunt in antartica when in pred 1 and 2 they hunt only when its really hot. At this point I was still in a really bad mood, until the first pred vs alien fight scene. It was just so cool to watch. The movie is loaded with super cool scenes like these that just made me wanna jump out of my seat and yell like at a boxing match..but im a civilized person so i tryed to stay cool hehe. So Ignore the bad reviews(and there are quite a few)those people already think the movie(the idea of AVP) is stupid to begin with. So its not like I was in the ""mood"" to watch this movie...I really wasnt. By the end of the movie I was in a super good mood.",1092355200,2,1046,3.938679245283019
1567532,4,B00005JMZK,"Okay, for starters, I really liked this movie.  I liked it way more than I thought I would, and it kind of makes me sad to say this, but I think this film is doomed.  This movie is taking two very loved series and putting them together, and to be honest, the film is no where near as good as Alien, and still a notch below Predator.  And because of the fact that it isn't as good, or better than the films in those series, it's going to be ripped to shreds, and it really does not deserve to be.

The action is great, the pace is fast but not insane, and the acting is suprisingly good!  The score is fitting, the effects are amazingly good, and at no point was I ever disappointed.  This film also solves Anderson's main problem from Resident Evil (another film not deserving of the beating it took) by giving us some characters to actually root for.  Which characters those are, well, you just have to wait and see.

*Spoiler* One aspect of the story I liked was making one of the monsters a hero towards the end.  It made the battle more enjoyable, and the outcome more important.  And there is an actual winner, although it's a small victory, but still a win.*End Spoiler*

I wish this film had more of a chance than it will probably be given.  If Fox had let the movie have an R (it looks slightly chopped up during some of the more violent moments involving human characters) then at least half the people complaining about the film would be happy.  The other half, the half that hate Anderson (why I have no idea) will just have to get over it.  I think he's a great director, and really should be given a little more respect in the cinematic and fan world.

1567533,4,B00005JMZK,"If you're a fan of Alien and Predator films, this movie will be a good time.  Its not without flaws though.

Negatives:

The PG-13 rating did not help the film at all. I wasn't hoping for a mindlessly grisly bloodbath, but the human killing was just way too toned down here. I didn't see a single graphic or creative human death scene. When the Predators first arrive and kill some humans, it is a huge letdown. You'll likely see better killing in an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The film lacked the suspense of Alien, Aliens, and Predator. Paul Anderson seems to have abandoned suspense and atmosphere in favor of pure action.  The storyline has some seriously dumb plot holes, a few of which pretty much invalidate key story elements that have already been established in the Alien films. Finally, they really should have toned down the exaggerated jerky camera work that ruined some of the action scenes.

Positives:

There are some great fight scenes between Aliens and Predators. The special effects are good. The Predators' character designs looked awesome. One good part of the story is that it gives a pretty interesting explanation regarding the conflict between Aliens and Predators.

Conclusion:

In the end, the action is what really counts.  Fans will not be disappointed as long as they aren't expecting a revolutionary work of sci-fi filmmaking.  I think its fair to say that people should expect nothing more than an entertaining showdown between two iconic movie monsters.  In that sense, AVP does the job reasonably well.  It adequately sets the stage for the battle, and then delivers the goods with some great Alien/Predator mano y mano showdowns. Its a good popcorn flick. Just don't go in expecting something as solid as Alien, Aliens, and the original Predator. That being said, I think AVP is a lot better than the last two Alien films. I personally enjoyed it more than Predator 2 as well, but its debatable which one is a better film between the two. I give AVP a solid B.  As I mentioned before, the plot could've been a lot better.  Certain parts simply don't make a bit of sense, and some story elements just seem totally inconsistent with the source material.  The movie could've been better.  But then it could've been a whole lots worse (I mean this IS from the guy who did the Resident Evil movie).  Its definitely a lot better than what the critics are saying though.  I would definitely recommend seeing it if you are a fan of the old films.",1092355200,,2485,4.7372093023255815

7941594,1,B00005JMZK,"I can remember back in the 90's constantly going to the arcade thoroughly and obsessively enjoying playing the Alien vs. Predator arcade game.  I got good at the game in 3 months times and even did better at it than most of my friends with the acception of the 2 friends that I envied because they beat the game 6 months before I had even played it.  Well while on an outing with some friends from school after playing for over 2 hours, I finally beat the game and man was I highly elated.  I even bragged about it in school on Monday.  Good times.  Unfortunately, this movie captured none of the fun, excitement, or even hard-hitting action that was all too inherent in the arcade game.

I can accept that the movie presented new characters and a different environment for them but what I refuse to accept are the sort of characters that were used and also the sort of environment that was used for the movie.

The problem is that all of the characters in this movie are all flat and one-dimensional dullards, not one of them is relatable, they are so painfully boring and devoid of fun, none of them are funny or likable, some of them are very annoying, and everyone of them has the personality of a big bag of cement.  I remember feeling excited to hear about them getting dynamite character actor Lance Henriksen to be in it, also, Ewan ""Spud"" Bremner, and also beautiful, funny, and sizzling hot Sanaa Lathan, so you can imagine my disappointment when I see them play the most worthless and boring characters that I have ever seen them play.

Having the setting be in Antarctica with underground ruins made for one unbelievably boring location that I will never feel has any place in an Alien movie much less a Predator movie.  As I see it a sci-fi, action, or horror movie(in this case all 3) should be shot in a small town, a part of a big city, a jungle, a science lab, an office building, an alien planet, campgrounds, a military base, etc..  The first 2 Predator movies and a couple of the Alien movies got that right plus other great action flicks in the past.  I acknowledge that plotwise the underground ruins did have a function to the plot but a really stupid one for certain.

***SPOILER ALERT***  I am about to go into what function the ruins actually has in the plot.  If you haven't seen this movie then you may not want to read this part as it is a spoiler.

There was this ridiculous long ago history of the Predators being treated like gods(bringing pharaohs to mind in particular) as the Predators ruled some ancient and primitive civilization by building them homes and temples and whatnot.  Eventually the Predators would convince a select few of their followers to lie down near some Xenomorph eggs to have Facehuggers impregnate them so that the Predators would have the grown Xenomorphs to hunt to show how tough and in control they were until one day the Xenomorphs out-numbered the Predators so they set there bracelets to explode destroying everyone and most everything in that civilization.

What I found painfully stupid about this backstory is:

-The completely silly hieroglyphics that detail the whole deal with the Predators and the Aliens in the past.
-The idea that these primitive people seem to have no trouble accepting these odd alien strangers.
-It isn't clear at all as to how the 2 cultures could speak an entirely different language and still somehow mange to communicate.
-it isn't clear where the Xenomorph eggs are coming from in that in the flashback the Queen is never shown.
-The whole idea of seeing to the birth of something that would become the Predators enemies is just beyond stupid.
-Other than that it's just a completely boring backstory,entirely.

It would've been much better and a whole lot more interesting if the Xenomorphs invaded the planet to mess with the Predators to make more of their kind rather than create them for sacrifice and to hunt.

***END OF SPOILER***

The action in this movie is dry, infrequent, and terribly boring.

The special effects and the gore effects all look terrible in that every single special effect and gore effect look very cartoon-like and laughable.

The boring as mud scenes of dialogue go on for far too long and are too many.

Giving the Xenomorphs an Elvis and Billy Idol lip curl, and lip motion with a hiss suggesting Hannibal Lecter's famous line from Silence of the Lambs was so over-the-top absurd and idiotic that it was almost hilarious.

The final fight at the end with the Queen Xenomorph dragged on way too long and totally failed to be exciting even once.

Finally, I don't know if the face for the final Predator at the end was makeup, a mask, or computer generated but all I can say is that the face used really sucked as the Predator had a much less scaly look, looked too clean, and had a totally laughable yellow glow.",1524268800,,4842,4.613053613053613
