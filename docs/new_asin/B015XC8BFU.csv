8735037,4,B015XC8BFU,"Irene Dunne perfected or introduced more enduring Jerome Kern standards than any other singer (including Fred Astaire), and by 1929 she was already established (via mentor Flo Ziegfeld) as a Kern leading lady by touring as Magnolia in the road company of SHOW BOAT, not filmed with Dunne until 1936 (James Whale, Universal). Meanwhile Kern and Hammerstein prepared a followup Broadway show for their original Julie, Helen Morgan, and the nostalgic 1890s songfest SWEET ADELINE gave Morgan four new Kern standards (""Here am I,"" ""'Twas not so long ago,"" ""Don't ever leave me"" and, immortally, ""Why was I born,"" famously introduced by Morgan perched atop the orchestra pit's upright piano). There also was an exceptionally rousing men's drinking chorus ""Some girl is on your mind,"" one of Kern's most complex and moving compositions. SWEET ADELINE lasted one short season (1929-30) on Broadway with an uninspired book (Hammerstein recycled the first half of SHOW BOAT's second act, omitting the miscegenation angle to focus on Adeline's showbiz rise from Hoboken to Gotham), but the score traveled to Hollywood for expansion, Dunne's assumption of the songs and unsuccessful rewriting of the inconsequential book.

This was Dunne's first Kern film (1934), just preceding the even richer ROBERTA. She inherited Morgan's four big numbers (Irene sings ""Why was I born?"" standing in the pit) but--already a Hollywood diva--received one new Kern song ""We were so young"" and his ""Lonely feet"" interpolated from the flop London run of his (non-Chekhov) THREE SISTERS earlier that year. Mervyn LeRoy directed, Sol Polito was DP, and the music was scored by Heinz Roemheld, arranged by Ray Heindorf and conducted by Leo Forbstein.

Dunne is very elaborately costumed by Orry-Kelly and looks fetching throughout, singing Kern in her usual grand-opera style and missing the beergarden earthiness Morgan gave these songs. There is one five-minute production number here that is truly fabulous (a distant predecessor to fancier RKO and Metro dance spectaculars), the fully choreographed dance reprise of ""Lonely feet."" In her staged Broadway triumph Adeline/Dunne restlessly paces a cramped boudoir, envying through window and mirror romantic couples dancing in the distance. Singing all the while she strides through the mirror, camera following, and we are seamlessly transported onto a mammoth Warners soundstage of symmetrically whirling dancers, as in any manic Busby Berkeley production. This dance ecstasy is dreamlike and temporal, like Ravel's LA VALSE, and as the song ends the camera recedes through the mirror ahead of Adeline/Dunne, returning her to the original Broadway-stage setting, quickly veiled by stage curtains. ""Lonely feet"" is a spectacular tour de force (and thoroughly neglected Kern), must have taken weeks to rehearse and shoot, and repeat viewings are necessary for this unique fusion of the disparate stylists Kern, Ravel, Berkeley and distant hints of Ophuls or Cocteau. Dunne makes it look so natural and easy, and this elaborate Busbyesque choreography is credited to Broadway's Bobby Connolly.",1502755200,,3111,5.452282157676349
8735038,3,B015XC8BFU,"I am a big fan of Irene Dunne, but this is a lack luster movie. The highlight of the story is that Irene Dunne takes a crack at some glorious Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II songs. The movie is set in the gay 1890s in Hoboken, N.J. Dunne plays the daughter of a tavern owner, and Donald Woods plays a song writer with whom Irene Dunne gets romantically involved. In supporting role are Hugh Herbert, Ned Sparks and Louis Calhern. Bobby Connolly wrote the dance numbers and Melvyn LeRoy directed this movie.  The songs of this film are; Here am I, Why I was born, Dont ever leave me, Twas not so long ago, We were so very young, and Out of the blue. This movie is a very thin vehicle for highly talented actress like Irene Dunne, but the songs of Kern-Hammerstein keep the movie rolling.",1445472000,3,787,4.390410958904109

8735041,4,B015XC8BFU,"Though the fact is not much remembered today, Irene Dunne was one of the leading musical stars of the 1930s, and she shines in this filming of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Broadway musical. The plot is  silly--Hoboken beer-garden singer becomes Broadway star--and the supporting  cast is not always the best (although Hugh ""Woo-Woo"" Herbert is  in fine form, if you appreciate his humor), but the music is glorious and  Dunne does it full justice. The songs include the well-known ""Why Was  I Born?"" and ""Don't Ever Leave Me,"" but for me, the  highlight is the lesser-known gem ""Here Am I."" Sadly, the print  of the movie is not in the best shape (lots of nicks and scratches),  depriving us of a full appreciation of what looks like some really stunning  black-and-white photography. Still, all in all, the film remains an  enjoyable experience. And Dunne and Kern's contributions make it memorable.",960854400,13,907,4.947019867549669
