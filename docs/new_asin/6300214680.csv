244509,4,6300214680,"A very fine acting job by all and Marlee Matlin is a real babe!
The only bad part of the movie is the message. This movie says that deaf people are handicapped and second class citizens. They MUST be taught to speak or  they are not really people. Total BULLCOOKIES of course but that's what the  movie says.
For anybody learning sign language this movie is a  must-have. Marlee's signing is a thing of beauty. What's-His-Face's however  is robotic.
BTW: Contrary to her actions in the movie, in real life  Miss Matlin does indeed talk and does a fine job of it too. I prefer her to  sign though. As I said she's a master.",944265600,6,622,4.3652173913043475

TITLE: Children of a Lesser God (1986)  R  1:58:45
  William Hurt, Marlee Matlin, Piper Laurie, Philip Bosco
  Randa Haines (Director)

  Nominated for five Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor [William Hurt], Best Actress [Marlee Matlin, who won], Best Supporting Actress [Piper Laurie] and Best Screenplay [Based on Material from Another Medium]) this beautifully photographed and emotionally moving film should be seen by ALL serious movie buffs. After watching this movie I had a whole new appreciation for my ability to hear  and, a whole new desire to better understand the feelings and experiences of the people that I care about (without imposing MY beliefs and prejudices onto THEM). How many other movies have you seen that bring about these types of feelings and desires in a person. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 1.78:1  Color  480p  MPEG-2 (8.6 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format (and, I'm sure, because of its SUBSTANTIALLY higher than average bit-rate), this transfer exhibits very-good to frequently excellent picture quality. This film's gorgeous cinematography is presented surprisingly well in this DVD transfer  which features richly saturated colors, good contrast and very-good shadow detail. In addition, the night scenes and dark indoor scenes (of which, there are many) are mostly un-crushed and free of artifacts. Also, relatively fine detail (for a DVD) is evident in the brighter scenes and in many of the close-ups of actor's faces and their clothing. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations to detract from the image. Overall, this movie's presentation on DVD has VERY good picture quality, and should satisfy all but the MOST anal retentive (picky) viewers.

AUDIO: Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono)

  Unfortunately, this movie's audio presentation comes nowhere near to matching its splendid visual presentation. The Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono) soundtrack, while featuring dialog that is mostly clear (though frequently ""boxy"" sounding [particularly with William Hurt's character]), has very limited dynamic range. In addition, there isn't any bottom-end nor top-end to speak of  that, coupled with harshness on even moderately loud musical passages and on all loud sounds, makes for an audio experience that is quite constrained and not very realistic sounding. Even though the movie is monophonic and dialog-driven, its audio presentation has somewhat less than acceptable sound quality.

244808,5,6300214680,"I'm in love with a deaf girl, and this excellent movie is a short course in Deaf culture. Please watch it if you know anyone who is deaf, or you just have an interest. Or just watch it because it's a classic love story about two people who come from very different cultures. Just seeing William Hurt trying to explain Bach to a person who has never heard music is just amazing. He felt wholly inadequate to the task, as anyone would. I made like a conductor during a musical part of another movie for my girl, and she loved it. I also bought a little speaker that she could touch and also made a light show that went along with the beat. She put it in her lap and was just fascinated with it. I now have a new appreciation for music as well as all sound, and it's really changed my life. I totally understand why Hurt felt bad about listening to his Bach when his girlfriend couldn't join him in the enjoyment of the music.

This movie will make you want to have a deaf friend, if there currently aren't any deaf people in your life.

Recommend it for hopeless romantics out there and those of you who are committed to making this place a better planet. Movie has a lot of messages and gives us a view into those who have committed their lives to others. William Hurt play's an outstanding role as a Speech Pathologists/Teacher at a New England boarding school for the deaf. Movie demonstrates a complex role of our private and social lives and utterly imbues compassionate consideration for all of humanity. Please site down and watch it with your kids over the weekend you'll be thankful that you did.

245103,3,6300214680,"CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD seemed like it would feel right at home on the Lifetime Network. There's nothing wrong with that, per se, except that those types of films tend to go for the easy emotional hook rather than dealing with harsher realities that might be more true to life. However, this film rises above that, to a degree, thanks to some good work by the reliable William Hurt and an eye-opening performance by deaf actress Marlee Matlin. Her presence was critical to making it work, and its success mostly rests on her shoulders.

 The story concerns a teacher, James Leeds (William Hurt), who is a new addition to the faculty at Kittredge School for the Deaf. He is an idealistic person with unconventional teaching methods who quickly earns the trust and admiration of his students. However an employee, Sarah (Marlee Matlin), and also a former student, proves more of a challenge. Despite her resistance to him trying to help, a romance blossoms between the two and sets the stage for a clash of wills.

 Aside from the outstanding performances (including a small, but affecting turn by Piper Laurie as Sarah's mother), one thing I thought was really well-done was the intimate moments of conflict between James and Sarah after the point in the story where they fall in love. Those dialogue exchanges were key to what I felt was the central struggle in the film. Nominally, it was about a man in love trying to get through to a deaf woman, but it can also be generalized to any relationship where communication can be difficult. Men and women often enter a relationship hoping that the other person will meet them on their own terms, but the reality is that it's best if they meet each other halfway. This is something I thought was beautifully explored in the film. I also enjoyed the many scenes where James interacts with his students, as these provided some comic relief.

 Still, not everything was so admirable. For one, I thought that the film took a rather patriarchal attitude towards women. Marlee Matlin, strong as her performance may have been, is still playing a strong-willed woman who finds herself in being with a man, just shy of being domesticated. At one point during the obligatory separation part of any romantic drama, she moves back in with her mother and gets a job, but doesn't find fulfillment in it. I understand that this film was made close to 30 years ago (and the play it was based on) so it's a product of its time, but things like that have a detrimental effect on how well a film ages. And with respect to its attitudes towards women, this film has not aged well in my opinion. They also took a rather pedestrian and cliche approach to the typical romantic elements of the story.

 Overall, this was a well-acted and (seemingly) well-meaning look at love in a unique relationship/circumstance. Some of the music was a little too on-the-nose, but generally was fitting. I also enjoyed the 80's pop songs they included in the soundtrack. What the film does best is explore the difficulties inherent in a relationship between a hearing and deaf person, which can be generalized to the difficulty in any relationship. Still, it's retrograde (at least, now) attitude towards women makes it a little lesser of a film than it could have been.",1421971200,,3279,4.7403508771929825

I get that he was a speech teacher, but ASL is such a comprehensive, beautiful and intricate language that his constant pushing for Sarah to talk became a bit puzzling.  I know the world was a lot different in the 1970s, but Deaf culture has been around for over a century, so I was surprised at his rather backward attitude.  I also get that Deaf people often have a hard time getting jobs, but it didn't seem that a lack of speech was what kept Sarah in her position as a custodian.  Rather, it was a lack of faith in herself - but whether that had to do with her Deafness or something else never really came out.  I would have loved to see these characters fleshed out more, their motivations and feelings made a bit more clear.  Also - without revealing too much, I would have liked there to be more detail and a little more heart in the ending scene, a little more resolution and emotion.

245574,5,6300214680,"You can teach a dog a trick, but you cannot convince the dog that it will be better off as a result. It's natural law, People are masters, dogs are lesser creatures.  Dogs may go to heaven, but it will be dog heaven, not people heaven; or so some might suppose.

This movie is about teaching the deaf to speak in a situation complicted by a passionate romance.  William Hurt's character specializes in convincing his students that learning to speak will be useful, such as when their arms are full, and the need to communicate with the hearing world suddenly arrises.  His young students accept this.  One resident of the school however, a non-hearing maintenance worker, bright, distinctly stubborn and independent has nothing but contempt for the idea.
She believes the skill benefits hearing world, but offers minimal worthwhile advantage to the speaker.

She also believes the process is condescending, and not far removed from a canine learning a trick.  To her, it adds to the notion that the hearing people are somehow more important on account of having this advantage, and the deaf ought to accept complacently their lesser level of existance as a natural fact.

Romantic ups and downs bring them together, conflicting notions draw them apart.  Their efforts toward mutual understanding, acceptance and respect causes us to like these people a whole lot.

It's a little gem of a story, and the acting is superb.

245578,5,6300214680,"I am the proud Father of a 34 year old deaf Daughter, Amanda. She enjoys Marlee Matlin TV shows, but this movie is very close to deaf culture as I have ever seen. Mr. Hollands Opus with Richard Dreyfuss, depicts some of the same philosophies with a deaf Son. Amanda was first diagnosed as being deaf when she was 2 years old from not talking or responding to voice or sounds. My immediate concern was to get her into an educational program so she could thrive. The choice in Ohio was strictly oral, BOOO, they would tie the childrens hands behind their backs if they attempted to sign, (this was a big second amendment NO NO issue for me), so, I moved to Tennessee leaving an empty house behind. The three of us were living in an airstream trailer maybe 10 miles from the Tennessee School for the Deaf, when a house became available just outside the gates of TSD. Of course we learned sign language and Amanda was already signing at 6th grade level at 3 years old. This did not fare well with TSD because she would be out pacing her peers and not be in her age group. They suggested mainstreaming her into a Public hearing School and that turned into a disaster because none of the other Kids knew how to sign and the Teacher was annoyed that an Interpreter was in the room. Ohio and Tennessee, turn your clocks back 200 years. So off we go to Northern California Fremont, California School for the Deaf, for Family workshops. We loved California with exeption of one tiny little hitch, we would be on a waiting list. Oregon was our next choice, but there are few if any jobs there to support your Family. Then we went to Washington, D.C., Gallaudet University Campus, Kendal School, which was ideal premium, except it was located in one of the most expensive Towns I had ever come across. Then we decided to move to Maryland and place her in the Maryland School for the Deaf in Frederick, MD where we could afford to buy a house 1/2 mile from MSD and find work for both of us. I had my heart set for Amanda to receive an advanced degree at Gallaudet, she moved to WV and attended Fairmont University instead. Quick story when she was 3, I had to take a job in San Francisco because the bottom dropped out of Tennessee Valley Authority. Amanda wanted to meet Mickey Mouse, so all she could sign was I want to meet Mickey Mouse, imagine 3 days of this going cross country to Los Angeles enroute to SF. Okay we get into Disney and her little eyes locked in on the Mouse, she ran through crowds of people and went straight up to Mickey and signed ""Hi, my name is Amanda"" and Mickey, without hesitation, turned and signed,""how old are you""? They started dancing and we tried to find out the name of the person who was in the Mickey suit upon exiting the park, they said, send Fan Mail. Well that we did and 2 months later we got a letter from the Woman named CB. She was one of 20 people who wore the Mickey suit at any given time. She was the only person who knew sign language, as a hobby. What are the odds of that happening? Amanda keeps in touch with CB to this day. CB was an Angel that day in the Magic Kingdom. While in San Francisco we caught a musical by MUSIGN, since disbanded, but they opened up the eyes and hearts of many people into their world. Another movie well worth watching, Michael Crichton's ""CONGO"" about a signing Ape (more like me) and this Ape knows over 600 signs and still lives in California, named Amy. Sign language can be a universal language in any Nation or dialect, for important things like hospital, toilet, hungry, sleepy, drug store, car or whatever you can dream of. Try explaining GOD in abstract to a deaf Kid. A little effort goes a long way. This is a great movie, note that Marlee Matlin is a great Actor, she will scare the bajeemas out of you when she was cornered to use her voice. My Amanda has no idea how LOUD she can be. So sign softly, to know another language is to have another life. This is English for those of you who think language is hard, it is strictly a conversion of English to hand gestures, you've got the English. If I can sign, anybody can, even an Ape named Amy. I'll have to close by saying that Deaf people are not dumb as the age old thinking goes. I worked with deaf Graduates from Gallaudet University on Nuclear Power Plant Design and Construction, I worked with deaf Engineering Graduates from Rochester Institute designing Chemical Plants. I met with a deaf Man who couldn't get a job with an advanced degree in computer science, so he opened up his own Government software business and employed 500 people. I met a deaf and blind man on the BART train in San Francisco who signing in his hand was the only way to communicate with him. I asked him how do you know when to get off of the train? The computer stops the train several times before getting to your destination. He replied, well the doors only open 4 times and that is my stop. Curious, I asked whhere are you going? He replied, I am going to work. ??? Work? What kind of work do you do? He replied, I am a computer programmer. ??? Uh, really? He replied, yeah, I have a QWERTY keyboard just like millions of other Americans and I use a tactile reader device, like a braille reader to tell me if I made a mistake in my line code. Makes you feel very grateful that people like him are driven to live despite everything. Our Native Americans used signs to communicate. Well, that's all for now Folks, enjoy the movie.

You gotta understand one thing that William Hurt is extermly WRONG when he don't keep his promise about not asking her to speaking. My (deaf) teacher used telling me as a child , ""If you don't want to speak, then don't let anybody force you!"" Why should I let them if you don't want for them telling you what do with your life? Not even your mom and dad.... I will tell you a true story :when I had a great speech teacher I been with for many years but I had not get a least or nope of speaking at all, but I know hard-hearing student whom successfully did.  I was envinious a lil' and asked my teacher why he got it but not me? She said ""I watched you all this years but speeching is not your thing, playing is""  What did she meant? In other words, she said it meant It was not really what I want but my parents asked for it. You just can't lock away in the room and make a deaf kid learn speaking for hours/years , it won't work (trust me) . It won't work if you lecture. They has to want it so they can put in hard working .

It came to me naturally when I said the first word ""mom"" , ""dad"" and ""I LOVE YOU"". If you make a child while they doesn't want then they will walk away like Marlee did in movie. I did the same , but I was like yawning and distracted playing with something while my speech teacher taught.",1264204800,,1516,3.9933993399339935

A very interesting study of Mute and deaf people.  Rand Haines (Antwone Fisher)  Directed this film where we encounter the problems of these unfortunate brothers and sisters finding themselves as they start growing and could not communicate.  James Leeds  (William Hurt) a teacher with unconventional approach way of teaching was warned by the school administration. John went his way and done his best to help his students so they can communicate better in life with success.  In his way came a young beauty by the name of Sarah, a very intelligent 25 year old mature woman who trusted no body. After graduation she decided to remain at the facility as a cleaner.  Sarah ( Marlee Matlin - mute and deaf herself) abandoned by her mother for being deaf and mute. She could never learn to communicate with her, she was in a way a loner, even she sexually molested when she  was a teenager. James fell in love with her and the two stuck together until....

245720,3,6300214680,"I see a lot of potential when I think back over the film that was `Children of a Lesser God'.  Now, I have not seen the play but I hear that it is much harsher, much more emotionally gut punching if you will.  When I watched `Children of a Lesser God' I expected to get that, that warm feeling of unease in my core, the feeling that everything is not as it should be but instead I got a much softer and much more refined experience.  I'm not saying that a sweet and effective love story is a bad thing, but aside from the major plot point regarding Sarah Norman's hearing disability the film is your generic love story with nothing really to distinguish it from every other love story out there.

Boy meets girl; boy likes girl; girl is standoffish; girl falls for guy; guy and girl have fight; boy and girl make up.

I wish I could say that there was more to it than that.

That isn't to say that as a love story it doesn't work well, for the wonderful performances by the two leads help elevate the film and carry it into our hearts; I just can't help myself from thinking that it could have been so much more.  I really relish in films that sink into the grit and rawness of a situation, but aside from one beautifully acted scene of aggression and emotional frustration the film is rather cheery and light; and to me that takes away from the point of the film.

The film follows James Leeds, a teacher in a school for the deaf who pushes his students to learn to speak, as he falls in love with a pupil who decided to stay at the school and work as apposed to venturing out on her own.  She is calloused towards him and his attempts to speak to her rather than sign, taking it as an insult to her disability, but she soon warms to him and they start a love affair that tests their relationship in ways they never knew possible.  Leeds ideas conflict with Sarah's morals and scar her emotionally, but his persistence in the preservation of their relationship helps keep them together.

I definitely feel as though the acting here is the saving grace, for both William Hurt and Marlee Matlin work hard to elevate the clich&eacute;d material they are given.  Much has been made over Marlee's Oscar win being sentimental and undeserved, but the fact of the matter is that her performance is very strong despite her material.  William Hurt is maybe even stronger, for he doesn't have a gimmick to work with and yet still manages to crawl inside his character.  I am kind of stunned that Piper Laurie received an Oscar nomination when her performance is not that noteworthy, but it isn't bad either so I can't be too upset over it.  At least she didn't win.

In the end `Children of a Lesser God' is a fine film, but it is not what it could have been.  It manages to make you care about the characters but it fails to make you care about the important lessons with regard to disability that the film claims to center around.  The film is too concerned with the love affair to make the disability anything more than a side-point.",1219881600,3,3026,4.354092526690391

245799,5,6300214680,"Hollywood has often visited the story of the teacher who comes to make a difference. There have been some fine films born from that premise but Children of a Lesser God gets my vote as the really interesting one.

William Hurt's James is an offering that has a real feel to it. He has wandered through some of his earlier days, drifting and learning through a variety of different disciplines and jobs (as principal Bosco points out to him while he is interviewing Hurt). He is cocky, passionate and searching but there is also the hint of arrogance in his motivations. William Hurt has never been better and he delivers a subtle, intense and yet a kind performance.

Marlee Matlin's Sarah is equally as compelling and her portrayal- explosive and needing at every turn. No wonder she won the award for this work. She conveys the frustration this character feels with a precise on target delivery.

What makes this story interesting is that it is the story of a teacher who reaches into himself, reaches into a quiet that has robbed a group of students of their ability to actively participate, and reaches into the life of a young woman who has imprisoned herself in her own frustration and anger. All are changed by the results and in a very real, positive and life renewing way.

Randa Haines direction is restrained, inspired and poetic and the film plays like a glimpse into someone's life. It's a beautiful thing to watch and to learn something from. And while I've said it's a story of a teacher who has come to make a difference, it is also a very tender and moving story of love. Love between James and Sarah, between James and his students and between the small community that is depicted here.

Special mention to of Piper Laurie and Philip Bosco's work here as the mother and the principal. They are two extremely fine character actors whose work (as always) is nothing short of a joy to watch. They lend the more sage advice that rounds this story's points out to have some real weight.

1)  Does William Hurt talk unusually slow in this film, like he does in all of his films?  Yes

2)  Was this film like an afterschool special, filled with overwrought acting and obvious advice?  No

3)  Will the women have 80s big hair and be wearing shoulder pads?  Quite possibly

4)  Do I remember correctly that William Hurt's character speaks both the female and male dialogue in most of the key scenes?  Oddly, yes.  But we forgive it, because it is a necessary device.

5)  Why is this film popping up in my subconscious, and why am I asking myself if I should watch it again?  Because the film is better than you remember, and the ideas it discusses are still applicable to your conflicts today.

If you haven't watched the movie recently, I recommend watching it again.  It is as strong as it was 20 years ago.

245804,5,6300214680,"Marlee Matalin received critical acclaim and a well-deserved Academy Award, for Best Actress, in this beautiful and intelligent drama.  Sarah (Matalin) is a deaf janitor at a school for deaf children who encounters a talented and patient hearing teacher who has just arrived (William Hurt).  Together, they embark on a relationship, filled with challenges along the way.  Nevertheless, Sarah comes to learn that love and respect does exist for her in the world.  What's more, the teacher comes to gain a new perspective, understanding and sensitivity for people born without the ability to hear.  He also learns that just because they lack this sense doesn't mean they aren't gifted in other ways, with their other senses (inward and outward).  Sarah can literally express to him what a wave sounds like, as it rises out of the water, and she can sense the rhythm of music in her nose.

The acting is believeable and very compelling, in this film, as William Hurt's character interprets his signing (and Sarah's) with feeling and a real connection to their unspoken language.  There are great, humorous moments in this film, as well as intense, introspective scenese, where we get a sense of Sarah's struggle to co-exsist with hearing, speaking people.  Since Sarah never spoke, she learned to build a rather isolated existence as a cleaning woman, and also as a very sensuous woman.  She never felt she belonged though.  This story truly brings dignity and humanity to this story character study of an extraordinary, intelligent and beautiful woman who just happens to live through her sensations, as a means of connecting to the sounds she cannot hear.

Marlee Matlin's Sara Norman is complex, multi-layered and oh so achingly beautiful. Their chemistry is amazing. You hurt when they hurt whilst also rooting for them.
The director somehow tackles the difficulty of using sign language in a film and her formula works perfectly. Also, Randa Haines manages to inject some real heartwarming humour in the form of the deaf students to balance out what could have otherwise been too serious a movie. Furthermore, the music is excellent. Children of a Lesser God is gentle little film and yet is raw sometimes.

There are some highly charged scenes between Hurt and Matlin, and the actors are doing a good enough job to gain our empathy, but all in all it's just a very predictable movie.

245860,5,6300214680,"""Children of a Lesser God"" is one of the best films released in 1986, starring William Hurt and Marlee Matlin.  Its brilliant plot never loses its emotional value.  Its story about a high school teacher, James, who teaches deaf students, then meets a deaf female janitor who doesn't speak, Sarah, is unique.  As secrets are revealed about Sarah's past, the film becomes increasingly interesting.  James and Sarah later fall in love, but the battle between Sarah and her inner demons prevents the relationship to function at the fullest.  Such twists turns arise within the characters that keep audiences always awaiting anxiously for what happens next.  Therefore, this film is more than a love story; it's a story about hope.  Such combination adds more unique themes.  The distinction between the spoken words and the sign language was brilliantly translated.  Rather than typing subtitles on the lower screen during the sign language scenes, James usually speaks what they are saying.  Many say that having subtitles may have likely ruined the film's emotional affect.  Such accomplishment makes the writing more brilliant.
Marlee Matlin became the youngest person to win the Oscar for the Best Actress catagory (age 21).  Her role as Sarah proved highly difficult, considering she only expressed herself nonverbally.  Her body language distinuish Sarah's emotions perfectly in every scene.  Few others have accomplished this in such magnitude.  Only one other actress has won an Oscar for playing a non-speaking lead role (Holly Hunter, ""The Piano"", 1993).  William Hurt performs his role as James wonderfully.  Though not as demanding as Matlin's role, his emotional value still holds on top.  James struggles between love and reaching out are expressed beautifully in every scene.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform their roles beautifully.
""Children of a Lesser God"" is a wonderful film for those looking for powerful themes.  This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.  Its quality proves that this is destined to become a classic.",1081296000,61,2074,5.262195121951219
245861,5,6300214680,"I would have to wonder about anyone who gave this movie a bad review, is it lack of empathy, or just understanding?
The acting was superior, and the tale was gripping. Even before I understood the issues personally, the movie was enlightening.
If it had a failure it was in assuming those of us with hearing understood the depth of the issues, and perhaps the play conveyed this more clearly.
One example: I learned to sign both ASL (American Sign Language) & SEE (Signed Exact English) I learned the latter first. SEE was designed by Hearing educators who felt it would help Deaf people learn to read better. It has a sign for each word corresponding to english, including signs for past participles, etc. ""Going"" is two signs ""go"" & ""ing"" In SEE ""Are you going to the store?"" requires seven signs. In ASL only three are required ""You go store"" The eyebrows are raised to indicate an interogative, (question) where telling someone (command) the eyes are squinted and covey a sort of forcefulness, (which is why some hearing people assume they are angry) but the same three signs are used. The ""ing"" is a hearing-designed sign flipping the little finger from the body towards the other person. If you sign for just one hour your eyes are getting tired, especially if you are using three times as many signs, and at that point when someone throws that ""ing"" at you it feels like they shot you between the eyes with a pellet gun.
ASL is simply a better language than the one designed by hearing educators who feel the deaf are ""Children of a Lesser God."" Whether it's thinking it's better for the deaf to learn how to speak, or thinking their language should be changed for their benefit, the message is the same, and the moviee did a good job of presenting this.",1073001600,20,1761,4.593650793650793

So,when hearing man falls in love with deaf woman, and they fall out, and so on, there is good reason to think you have been there, heard it all before. Well, listen up, you may be surprised by the quiet assured tale that is the Childen of a Lesser God. A film that gives us an idea of what we thought we knew: Love needs more than words to keep it lit.
This is a film about a deaf and a hearing world trying to find a compromise in communication and echoes of all our stories of love and grief. William Hurt as a Speech Therapist, arrives with a maverick reputation and a certainty in his expectations of the speaking deaf. He can interpret the signs, yet can't undertand his lover's abused heart.

Marlee Matlin has agony across her face that has little to do with cleaning the toilet of a School for the Deaf, or her own deafness. Fortunately, the expressive face also shows the vulnerable tenderness that lies beneath and makes you believe in her struggle to be heard. The script avoids shouting about how the experience of loving someone who has hurt her, affects a woman who is deaf. She falls in love as a woman, and is affected as a woman.
In the company of a strong supporting cast, the characters learn something about their special needs when in love or alone. They stutter into love with a simple but limiting,vocabulary of passion and desire. Like all our own tales of love and grief, the early promise proves illusory when the enduring relationship requires more understanding of the other than we believe ourselves capable.",955843200,23,1632,4.513513513513513

Although as another commenter admitted the development of their relationship from ""who's the mysterious girl"" to ""I love this girl"" was indeed a bit quick, the rest of the film unfolded quite nicely. I really liked how the complication in their relationship was portrayed and the layers of Sara's character. We don't see quite as much with James. Only that he is curious to know why she refuses to speak and at times adamant that she get on the bandwagon assuming that should she learn she could do more with her life. When in reality it was not her voice that held her back but her fear and distrust of the hearing community. With good reason at that.  Her dad walked out on her, her mother blamed her for it, she was diagnosed retarded, called stupid, boys used her... All she had experienced was rejection until she went to the deaf school. I liked that in the end she broke from that fear of rejection and was able to start moving on with her life yet she still never spoke and that it was James that had to find means of acceptance.
