8653975,3,B00JV93IW8,"La Demora is quite a grim little film. It depicts a middle-aged mother of three single-handedly taking care of her aging, ailing father in a cramped apartment in Montevideo, Uruguay. Among the myriad problems Maria faces, Agustin has begun to wander the streets of the city when left alone without being able to remember how to return home. He is thus becoming a danger to himself and a burden on his daughter, increasingly so as time passes. Facing the reality of her father's need for more intensive supervision, Maria is advised by a caseworker that only the homeless have a chance of receiving subsidized institutionalization given the paucity of social support provided by the state. Maria's income, earned through piecework sewing of denim jeans pockets, is barely sufficient to provide for her family's basic needs and so private nursing home care is out of the question. What to do? In despair, Maria leaves her father without identifying papers on a bench in the courtyard of a housing project with the expectation he will be picked up by the authorities, thought to be homeless, domiciled in a shelter, and then admitted to an old-age facility after his needs have been assessed. What ensues hardly follows the plan and creates the pathos that anchors the film narratively. Although Maria's dilemma is poignant, her solution seems terribly cruel and heartless. She is thus difficult to like or feel great empathy for which makes the story hard to tolerate, at times. But La Demora is a very well made film with excellent acting and so a suffocatingly claustrophobic ambiance is rendered expertly. Film enthusiasts who appreciate a finely etched portrait of individuals who are at the edge psychologically and without the financial and emotional resources to deal effectively will no doubt find something to admire here. 3.5 stars.",1412380800,,1840,5.055921052631579
