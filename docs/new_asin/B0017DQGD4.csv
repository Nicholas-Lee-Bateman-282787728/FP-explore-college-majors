It is realistic and accessable to persons in all stations of life and I feel it will make anyone's life who watches it more fullfilling along with having greater Joy.
I plan to watch it many times and hope that Kim's honest approach to life and one geared to overcoming all of life's hurdles will rub off on me.
I totally recommend it and recommend it being shown to Youth Groups, Church Groups, Community Service Groups and so forth--it should be good for all ages.
Few videos have touched me to this extent and I've watched a bunch of them.",1348963200,,682,4.412698412698413

I searched on amazon to see if there was a video or DVD of it, and there was, so I just had to get it!  So inspiring!!!!!!  I recommend this to anyone!",1314921600,,245,3.5660377358490565
