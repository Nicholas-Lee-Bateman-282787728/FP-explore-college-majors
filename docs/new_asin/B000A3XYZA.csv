2357026,5,B000A3XYZA,"It is a wonderful performance, much much more impressive then the austere Munich performance on the Farrao Classics DVD. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment plays brilliantly for William Christie.

Anna Caterina Antonacci is a glamorously beautiful woman with a hell of a stage charisma. Andreas Scholl is outstanding and fulfils his status as one of the two greatest countertenors today (the other one is of course David Daniels). His two arias in the beginning of the second act, when he meets his sister Eduige dressed like a blind vagabond is breathtaking! And as Grimoaldo, tenor Kurt Streit is outstanding too.

This is for my taste a glorious DVD that no Handel fan should miss!",1126828800,7,691,4.948275862068965
2357037,5,B000A3XYZA,"I am not very fluent in English to write an extensive review, but I would like to say this recording is very very good. To People which like Baroque Opera, and specifically Handel's operas, I recommend very much this recording.",1210464000,,227,4.7
2357038,2,B000A3XYZA,"In spite of my personal love for most Glyndebourne productions, this Rodelinda does not really fill my expectations.  Nice scenaries and lavish costums.  However, the major drag here are... the singers (!!!????)... and William Christie conducting a reduced chamber orchestra (The Age of Enligthment)without enough stamina.  It is difficult to believe that this is the same team that staged the brilliant Glyndebourne Giulio Cesare.  Andreas Scholl disapoints me here, he does not match the art of Michael Chance in the same role for the the Bayerische Staatsoper`s version of Rodelinda (also on DVD).  Although his voice is beautiful and spotless (I think he is a great singer and... by the way... a great individual as well) for some reason he lacks of passion and seems unattached to the drama.  Believe me I put the best of my efforts to like his singing but I could not. Who said that barroque operas have to be passionless?  The same opinion goes to Mrs. Antonacci when compared to her Bayerische's counterpart Dorotea Roschman (Sp?).  The sound in the Bayerische version is much better too, denser and at a faster pace fitting to the action on stage.  Sorry but my personal opinion is that this Glyndebourne's Rodelinda is slower and boring compared to the Bayerische's one.",1191456000,18,1280,5.0

2357041,4,B000A3XYZA,"More than many opera seria, Handel's 1725 Italian opera, ""Rodelinda"", provides such a palpable story of jealousy, revenge and undying devotion that it is no wonder the opera itself has been given such widely diverse translations over the years. I was fortunate to experience two wonderful productions of ""Rodelinda"" just this past year. The first was Stephen Wadsworth's elaborate Metropolitan Opera production set on a beautiful 18th-century country estate, starring superstar soprano Rene Fleming in the title role and the extraordinary countertenor David Daniels as her husband Bertarido. The second also starred Daniels but with rising soprano Catherine Naglestad in David Alden's expressionistic film noir adaptation at the San Francisco Opera (first staged by Munich's Bavarian State Opera).

The 1998 Glyndebourne Festival production, directed by Jean-Marie Villegier and captured on this DVD, takes yet another creative path by setting the story in the black-and-white world of 1920's silent cinema. Completely different in execution and style, all three versions simply prove how the highly charged drama and soaring music translate easily in almost any period setting. Although Alden's production is more audacious and heavily symbolic, Villegier brings a relatively simplified approach to the storyline and encourages a highly stylized, silent screen type of acting from his cast. For the most part, it works, and the minimalist sets by Nicolas de Lajartre and Pascale Cazales provide an effective counterpoint. Costume designer Patrice Cauchetier, however, sometimes gets carried away with the fussy, anachronistic clothing she provides, which does little to enhance the performances.

Fortunately, the stellar cast is strong enough to transcend such stylizations and shortcomings. In the demanding title role that requires a strong enough voice to carry eight significant arias, veteran soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci is a fiery presence who conveys defiance with ease and feels at home with elaborately expressive vocal lines. Truth be told, her vibrato can be off-putting at times, and her regal demeanor works against the emotion of the more vulnerable passages, for example, during her extravagant rendition of the heartbreaking Act III aria, ""Se 'l mio duol non e si forte,"" in which Rodelinda thinks her husband Bertarido is dead. However, Antonacci's passion and professionalism carry the day.

As Daniels has proven recently, Bertarido is one of the truly great roles for an accomplished countertenor. Luckily, Andreas Scholl has a beautiful, emotive voice and fluently handles the wide range of singing from the melancholy of ""Dove sei, amato bene?"" to the anger of ""Vivi, tiranno!"" with equal ease. Scholl is at his peak during his poignant Act II arias, ""Con rauco mormorio"" and ""Scacciata dal suo nido"", where his coloratura is particularly impressive. As an actor, however, he is not as charismatic a presence as Daniels (at least back in 1998 when Scholl was starting to emerge on the scene) and consequently tends toward a certain banality for a king who has been not only deposed but left for dead. All is forgiven, however, with the much anticipated duet between Antonacci and Scholl which ends Act II, the magnificent ""le t'abbraccio"", which does not disappoint.

The rest of the cast handles their roles with uncommon skill - tenor Kurt Streit as the impatient usurper Grimoaldo, baritone Umberto Chiummo as the dastardly henchman Garibaldo, countertenor Artur Stefanowicz as Bertarido's faithful sidekick Unulfo, and mezzo-soprano Louise Winter as Bertarido's sister Eduige. All sing magnificently in this production, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment complements the voices perfectly under the seasoned baton of William Christie. The one major drawback is the way the opera is filmed in overly dark shadows, especially at the beginning, and the alternating long and medium shots that seem unnecessarily busy at times. The visual edginess and restlessness tend to distract from the onstage drama when the focus should be on the beauty of the music. Regardless, this is a faithful record of a Handel masterwork wonderfully performed. The superb Baroque music speaks for itself.",1138147200,27,4222,5.470858895705521
2357042,4,B000A3XYZA,"Two very good DVD recordings of Handel's great opera Rodelinda became available in 2005. One of them is from a 1998 performance at the Glyndebourne festival and the other from a 2003 performance at the Bavarian State Opera. I will call them, respectively, British and German, although both are truly international. For example, in the British version both kings are sung by Germans, while the German version features British singers in these major roles. The ""British"" conductor is native American (William Christie),  and his ""German"" counterpart (Ivor Bolton) is British. The staging directors are French and American, respectively.

Much has been said by other reviewers about the British version, and I agree with most of these mostly favorable comments, especially in respect to the great art of Anna Caterina Antonacci and Andreas Scholl. I believe, however, that most of these reviewers have not been exposed to the German recording, which seems to be less popular. I have had a chance to experience both versions extensively on a state of the art video and stereo system.

I prefer the staging and filming of the British performance and the artistic presentation of some singers, especially Louise Winter and Kurt Streit. The more lyric quality overall of the singing may be attractive to some viewers of the British DVD. In my opinion, both techniques of presentation are acceptable. Subtitles provided in English, German, Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese help in appreciating the dramatic plot.

I do have serious problems with the sound quality of the British rendition: Compared with the warm and vibrant sound of the German version, the sound produced by the British DVD is somewhat flat and muffled. The German but not the British version gives a feeling of being in the presence of a live performance. Apparently the German version was recorded by state of the art equipment and/or techniques.

In conclusion, no ideal video recording of Rodelinda is available today. The opera was performed more recently under the baton of William Christie at Glyndebourne and Paris. Judging from the raving reviews of these apparently unrecorded performances on the Internet, I am hopeful that one day I will be able to view a performance of Rodelinda on DVD that will satisfy me completely.",1137974400,18,2299,5.152815013404826
2357043,5,B000A3XYZA,"Originally released on VHS several years ago, Rodelinda now comes to the DVD. Although the DVD offers little more than the older VHS, it is nevertheless welcome coming, as it does, hot on the heels of the Munich Rodelinda starring Michael Chance and Dorothea Roeschmann. One could argue that the staging is somewhat out of date now, but few could argue the quality of the vocal contributions from each of the soloists. It certainly wins hands down over the Munich performance on Farao.

Rodelinda, one of the triumvirate of classic Handelian operas of the mid-1720s, is a classic of psychological action and shows Handel at his best as an interpreter of human drama and emotion. In the hands of William Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Rodelinda comes alive in a timeless production from Jean-Marie Villgier. A sort of cross between the Prisoner of Zenda and movies of the silent period, this production was atmospheric and moving, though some will rankle at the 'needless' condescensions to humour (Garibaldo's cigarette aria for example, or his leaping up after being shot to take part on stage in the final chorus dispensing champagne to all).

What sets this performance apart from others of the past. at both Glyndebourne and Covent Garden, is the singing. Anna Caterina Antonacci was utterly at ease in the anguished part of the distraught queen Rodelinda, mourning the loss of her husband Bertarido (Andreas Scholl, making his stage debut) and fighting off the attentions of the victorious dictator Grimoaldo (Kurt Streit). The supporting characters are more than simply adjuncts - Louise Winter as Eduige, Artur Stefanowicz (Unulfo) and Umberto Chiummo (Garibaldo) play their parts too in making this an outstanding production. Streit plays the part of Grimoaldo as a noble conqueror, guilty over his victory but unable to contain his passion for Rodelinda, vascillating over whether to have Bertarido executed, though capable of nobility at the end when his life is saved by Bertarido. Chiummo as the treacherous henchman Garibaldo displayed admirable coloratura and an almost feline edge to his actions that effectively got across the double-dealing nature of his character.

Andreas Scholl made his stage debut in this performance at Glyndebourne. Initially edgy and uncertain, his character grows in stature, and by the end his characterisation is utterly convincing. His entrance in Act one with its famous aria 'Dove sei?' was almost as if time stopped and we were transported back to Handel's time - his voice grave, pure and heartfelt. He coped well with some very difficult passage work in Act 2, but brought the house down in his duet with Antonacci at the end of Act 2 (Io t'abbraccio) and his 'Vivi Tiranno' at the end of act 3. His prison scene in Act 3 is streets ahead of the most recent Rodelinda recording in its dramatic awareness.

In all this was a very sucessful production that, by and large, achieved the praise it deserved in the press. Anyone interested in baroque opera will not wish to be without this video, nor will anyone who is a fan of good opera, well sung and well acted. Highly recommended, and worth probably 6 *",1131408000,14,3179,4.992452830188679
2357044,5,B000A3XYZA,"This is one of the best Handel opera stagings I have seen, very modern and artistically daring. William Christie and his orchestra are great, and the singers are really outstanding, especially Antonacci in the title role, and the two countertenors. Rodelinda is becoming very popular these days, and hopefully we will soon see  more new producitons of this opera, but I think this one is set to become a classic. A must see for anyone interested in the glories of Baroque opera, and brillantly performed Handel.",1130457600,16,511,4.941860465116279
2357045,5,B000A3XYZA,"I have seen my share of dusty, mothballed productions of Handel operas and at this point I look forward to modern productions; it seems Handel, and opera seria in general can work particularly well in highly stylized stagings and this Glyndebourne version, directed by Jean-Marie Villegier, is a feast for the eyes, ears and the brain; there's no powdered wig or corset in sight, and the modern context of whole story is skillfully played up.
Set in the ""silent movie"" period, lighted in stark contrasts, with beautifully realized black and white film feel to it, this is a very distinctive looking production; the costumes and make up all add to the visual splendour.
Musically, it could not be better; under the direction of William Christie, the playing of Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is tight, crisp and just about perfect, and the soloists excel both vocally and dramatically.
Anna Catrina Antonacci is incredibly intense in the title role- this is not an elegantly poised Handel delivered at an arm's length. Andreas Scholl plays Bertarido; his singing is impeccable, and who knew coolly restrained Scholl had it in him to deliver such a moving performance on stage! All his arias are standouts and he brings the house down with Viva Tiranno in Act III. There's plenty of Senesino's roles left for Scholl to play, and it looks like he's on his way to become a blazing hot star on the opera circuit.
As for the rest of the cast: Kurt Streit as Grimaldo, Umberto Chiummo as Garibaldo, Louise Winter as Eduige, Artur Stefanowicz as Unulfo et al, are just as good- there are no weak links here. This is one of Handel's operas where the plot actually makes sense and this is an extraordinary group of performers who can act and sing the hell out of Handel at the same time.
The DVD package is very spare- no extras of any kind, but there are subtitles in several languages, and the sound and picture quality are excellent.
For any Baroque opera lover, this is a must-have; for everybody else, this is a great piece of musical theatre of the highest caliber, brilliant, often unnerving and extremely moving, and, methinks, highly accessible; this is Handel for the modern age. Five stars and counting- let's just hope there's more where this came from.",1127952000,75,2262,4.78772378516624
2357046,5,B000A3XYZA,"Villegier presents Handels great opera Rodelinda in silent movie terms - characters are made up with white paint and lipstick; the costumes on the women are gorgeous 1920s and the acting is heavily stylized as in an old Gloria Swanson film. And it works!!! the stylized movements and emoting exactly fit Handels very stylized and formal composing. To top it off the singing is superb. Andreas Scholl in his operatic debut is astounding - ""Dove Sei"" is heart rendingly beautiful, the bravura arias are superb and the acting is heartfelt. As a matter of fact all of the singers are thoroughly in the Handel idiom and William Christie leads his great Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in a very dramatic performance.

Sometimes I get the feeling they are not discarded but sent onwards. This time they landed on Rodelinda.  Its plot is silly enough for any daytime soap.  The staging is boring but unobtrusive. The music is heavenly. The title role has been recorded  by the likes of Sutherland and Stich Randall.  On DVD, I had to decide between Fleming (Met 2012) and Antonacci (Glyndebourne 1998).  I went for the latter and I am not sorry.  Ms. Antonacci continues to astonish with her beauty and secure vocal technique.  The only other female role is sung ravishingly by Louise Winter.  STreit, Scholl, Chiummo and Stefanowicz all show their vocal prowess. William Christie conducts the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.  I give it 5 stars.",1447977600,,866,4.993006993006993

Noting a  renaissance for Handel operatic works  judging by the relatively recent (2011) Met HD performance with Renee Fleming and a number of very recent releases on Blu-ray of various Handel operas, I turned to my trusted preview venue: youtube.com
Indeed, after previewing a number of these including the Met's and Bayerische (Roschmann, Chance) performances, I happened on this 1998 Glyndebourne gem.
Without an iota of doubt it is a GEM not to be missed.

One must admit that tastes are individual. As Prince Orlofsky remarks in Die Fledermaus- ""chacon a son gout"", but clearly some performances 'move your soul' & 'tickle your fancy'  far more than others.
First the performers: Antonacci, Scholl, Streit, Chuimmo, Winter, Stefaniwicz  are all wonderful. Great voices, commanding, convincing & expressive acting; perfect for their roles---Cecil B. DeMille couldn't have done better!
William Christie and The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment  are perfect for Handelian repertoire; and the tempo, contrary to another reviewer's judgement, is ethereal- especially given the plot elements and sentiments expressed.
Jean-Marie Villeger's stylish production - placed in the silent movie era - is magnificent, simple and fitting. No unnecessary extraneous elements
Check out the aria "" Io T'Aabraccio""  wiith Antonacci & Scholl on youtube & see if you are not hooked!!!!""  [...]

One quibble: unfortunately, the only DVD disc of this performance currently available in NTSC and Region 1 or 0 for play on U.S. equipment is a KULTUR studio release. As usual Kultur charges premium prices for an inferior product; they seem to have no respect for their customers.
Although the picture quality is quite good and the sound is very reasonable ( unusual for Kultur releases judging by the large number I have seen &/previewed and as many other reviewers have also remarked) they are more than cheap here with their flimsy packaging and next to nil accompanying  printed material (in this case: a single page, double sided--on the first side an exact replica of their cover, and on the other a simple  listing of the number of Chapters without any other truly explanatory material----gotta keep their costs down you know, never mind the customer!)

How I wish this performance would be remastered by a caring,credible recording company in blu-ray format with uncompressed sound; and, judging from experience, they would surely include proper subtitles ( as in the Met's production), more than adequate informative printed material and likely special features too (if initially available)
---and at a very competitive price point!",1356480000,5,2664,5.34688995215311
8074222,3,B000A3XYZA,"The singing was superb, but when I bought it I was EXPECTING an epoch scenario instead of a very dark 1920's one.  I would have wanted to know this before I bought it. Thank you. Maria",1347321600,,184,4.111111111111111
8074223,5,B000A3XYZA,"Rodelinda, Regina di Longobardi(1725)by Georg Friedrich Hndel has some of the most beautiful arias from this outstanding composer. It's delightful to watch and listen to Andreas Scholl as the King Bertarido: his arias Dove sei, amato bene, Scacciata dal suo nido and Vivi tiranno are prooves of the greatness of this excellent countertenor. About the ambiance of the opera it remind us a little the times of the nazis in Germany, perhaps, because of the costumes worn by the singers. Artur Stefanowicz as Unulfo has three moving arias in the opera, but-without doubt- the last one, Un zeffiro spir yields a charming sound sui generis. Kurt Streit as Grimoaldo sings one of the most romantic arias that I have heard: Prigionera, l'alma in pena, which he speaks about the sacrifice of the freedom in exchange of a no reciprocal love; in this case the love of the Queen Rodelinda. Anna Caterina Antonacci, in the role of Rodelinda is full of vigour; her aria Morrai, s, against the tyrant Garibaldo is diametrically opposed to the tender roles for the haendelian prime donne. Louise Winter as Eduige represents a sensual role. She is veri good in the recitatives, too. Umberto Chiummo as Garibaldo is outstanding; his aria Tirannia gli diede il regno is the best performance of wickedness that I have seen in a opera by Hndel. I recommend this DVD! It's superb",1284422400,3,1357,4.878787878787879
8074224,5,B000A3XYZA,"That is, the best production I can imagine of the best opera by the best of all opera composers. Well, I could back-pedal and equivocate on the last of my superlatives; there's Mozart to be considered, and a few others. But I'd stick to my guns on the first two:

Rodelinda is Handel's finest theatrical accomplishment, the opera in which the music and the drama are most affectively integrated and consistently inspired. Part of its success results from a libretto based on a play be the great French dramatist Pierre Corneille, the only libretto of any Handel opera, in my opinion, that isn't marred by extraneous bombast or silliness. Composed for the London stage in 1725, Handel's score for Rodelinda shows a concentration and expressive coherence quite apart from his Italianate florid display pieces written before or after. In fact, Rodelinda comes closer to being ""through composed"" (in the English sense) than any other large scale work by Handel, perhaps by any composer of baroque opera. The integration of singing and orchestra is magnificent, fully as 'intellectual' as any work of JS Bach yet infallibly emotive and stage-worthy. This is an opera which must NOT be smudged by vulgar stage capers or clownish costumery. It has to be all of a piece, a darkly anxious melodrama that ends in relief of tension, a 'happy ending' still tinged with sorrows endured.

That's the accomplishment of this production. Every note and every image sustains the mood of passion. There are no cheap tricks or pratfalls. The staging captures the glamour and worldliness of the pre-WW2 black-and-white cinema, yet there's no clash of anachronism of the sort that hampers more than helps many productions of 18th C opera. The photography is totally proficient in realizing the cinematic ambience. Costumes and sets blend with the demeanors of the singing actors, and those actors are superb in gesture, posture, facial expression, all the qualities of Hollywood sophistication. Beautiful, stately Anna Caterina Antonacci is perfect as Rodelinda, a film-maker's dream casting. Kurt Streit, if he were not singing for his supper, would have done well as a rival for Fairbanks or Valentino. Umberto Chiummo, the odious schemer Garibaldo, could easily play Iago in Shakespeare's Othello or the gnarliest mafioso in any Hollywood gangster flick. This is a filmed stage opera that truly works as a visual film!

And the music is divine. From the first entrance of conductor William Christie, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment performs Handel's challenging score flawlessly. WE get to see the players during the overture, as should almost always be the case on opera DVDs, and their confidence in their instruments and pleasure in the music is visible in their faces. This, dear readers, is exactly how baroque music should be performed, on the instruments for which Handel composed and with the tasteful virtuosity Handel presupposed.

Antonacci and Streit are matched in vocal artistry especially by countertenor Andreas Scholl in the role of Rodelinda's true husband Bertarido. All through the opera, I anticipated their climactic duet, as they await their fate at the harsh hands of the tyrant Grimoaldo, and my anticipation was rewarded. It's not the showiest duet in Handel's oeuvre, but it's one of the loveliest, and the two lovers sing it exquisitely. Likewise, the arias of Rodelinda are not as flashy as those of Tamerlano or Serse but their affective musical impact accumulates powerfully.

I've seen/heard this production, with a different cast, on stage in two cities, and I've watched this DVD three times since I bought it. Is that an adequate testimony to how good I think it is?",1274745600,4,3692,5.11608623548922
8074225,5,B000A3XYZA,"This one is a total success. The update to the 1930's and a slightly fascist regime works so well it's a wonder it wasn't done this way in Handel's time. The women are regally and gorgeously costumed. Beautifully and imaginitively directed. Everyone acts almost as well as they sing, but the singing requires much more of them and they all acquit themselves admirably. It's one difficult aria after another for all concerned and Handel characterizes each character within the music so very well. Delightedly recommended.",1232668800,6,520,5.129411764705883
8074226,5,B000A3XYZA,"I'm a bit hypersensitive to hammy operatic acting, and this particular staging used hammy silent movie acting as a deliberate choice, so it took a bit for me to get past it.  In the end though, it was worth it to make the mental shift.  I wish the shift had taken less effort for me, but not being a silver-screen fan, I think that's more my thing than a failure of the staging.  And to be fair, once I did put in my mental clutch and make that shift, it was effort well spent.

So ultimately, this DVD was lovely.  Rodelinda/Antonacci's voice wasn't quite as champagne-colored and sparkly as I might have liked in a baroque soprano, but it was really wonderful, and Bertarido was of course fabulous.  (He descends into chest voice for a few notes, and the resonance and precipitous drop in range literally made me gasp.  My 74-year-old mom, who was watching with me and comes from an Italian family that worships 19th century Romantic opera, now thinks Andreas Scholl walks on water.)

Unulfo was lovely, Garibaldo was a delightful moustachio-twirling baddie, and Grimoaldo surprised me in that he was able to make the shift from slapworthy bad guy to really a rather sympathetic remorseful ex-villain.  Only Eduige left me rather cold; I find that character more sympathetic than she was made out to be here.  All of the voices were delightful, full and nimble although I could tell that some were perhaps better suited to opera buffa than the earlier stuff.

An excellent DVD overall and well worth the price -- and aside, why do so many of these DVDs have no special features?  I enjoy watching ""making of"" features on movie DVDs, sometimes more than the movies themselves.  They need to start putting things like that, interviews and BTS featurettes, on operatic DVDs as well.",1230336000,,1781,4.7064516129032254
8074227,5,B000A3XYZA,"King Bertarido is missing and believed to be dead--a fine monument has been erected in his memory.  Grimoaldo, a villain with scruples, has usurped the throne by promising to marry the king's sister Eduige and then dumping her to pursue the luscious royal widow Rodelinda.  The opera opens with Rodelinda bewailing her fate and spurning Grimoaldo, who is encouraged in his nefarious pursuit by the plotting Garibaldo--the real architect of the king's downfall. The next scene shift to the monument, where a weary Bertarido has returned and pauses to reflect that the loss of his throne is nothing beside the loss of his wife and son. There he encounters his loyal friend Unulfo who gives him the news. The plot proceeds in convolutions thereafter, but Rodelinda remains faithful to her spouse and ultimately he regains both his love and his throne.

This production dating from the Glyndebourne Festival of June 1998 is blessed with the conducting services of William Christie.  The title role of the faithful Rodelinda is sung in stellar fashion by Anna Caterina Antonacci, a lovely singer who lights a dark stage with her radiant performance, particularly in the notable aria of Act II.  Although it is hard to top her performance, Andreas Scholl does so as the noble king Bertarido.  The sound of both singers and period orchestra is flawless.

The staging is daringly set in the glamorous era of the silent movies and the color palate of the costumes is a mute monochrome of black, white, cream, beige and almost lavender. The sets are soot and sepia tones and the lighting can be downright murky at times.  There's no doubt in my mind that the elegant costumes for the royal ladies Rodelinda and Eduige are a smashing success.  They drip with pearls and ooze glamor and leave nothing to be desired.

I hate to say this of this otherwise fabulous production, but the costumes and makeup for the men make for a very austere visual spectacle when only the guys are on stage. Their costumes are either white uniforms or dark coats, the pancake makeup makes everyone look dead and the only touch of color comes from the vivid red lipstick.  I suspect that this idea worked great on a live stage, and less well for the filmed production.  This DVD captures an actual performance.  We enjoy intermissions between acts with the audience as they savor Andreas Scholl's Glyndebourne debut.  His magnetic stage presence lends color to this memorable effort. Pure gold! (Except for the lipstick!)",1226707200,4,2489,4.895238095238096
