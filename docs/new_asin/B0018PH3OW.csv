3418419,5,B0018PH3OW,"This is a great set! Twenty-Three episodes of the new George of the Jungle series! Trust me, this set is worth every single penny! It's not too expensive and its has more than eight hours of entertainment!

Buy this set and enjoy! It is worth the price, plus the series if filled with plenty of humor and action along with memorable characters. So if you are looking for a swingin' good time, buy George of the Jungle Season One !!!",1219622400,,432,4.4
3418420,5,B0018PH3OW,"It's finally here !  The hit Cartoon Network series ""George of the Jungle"" is finally on DVD !  (It's rather hard to believe that the original version was done by the same person that did ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"".)

Join our hero George as he saves the vast jungles that he calls home along with his friends like the intelligent primate Ape, the spunky Ursula, the sweet Magnolia, the canine pachyderm Shep, and a few others to boot.  He may not be the smartest jungle king, but he does his very best to help any animal friend in need.

The season one set has 3 discs with 23 episodes in the set; nothing more, nothing less.  Not even a language option is involved.  And another thing, there are two special episodes missing in the set which are the holiday themed episodes (""Jungle Bells""/""The Goat of Christmas Presents"") and recently, the one-hour special ""Escape From Madmun Island"".  Still, it's a terrific set with episodes in anthropomorphic widescreen format (Even though the first half of the second disc needs fixing...).

This is one DVD set you won't wanna miss out on !  Keep watching Cartoon Network for more on this series and, of course, ""Watch out for that tree !""",1219363200,6,1179,4.6521739130434785

3418433,5,B0018PH3OW,"As a child this was an all time favorite. Brought back a lot of memories and smiles. GOOD CLEAN Cartoon for all age.

Just as I recall it being from my childhood, no it does not have all the flash and cgi of todays cartoons but it is funny.  Not as so gore centered and violent as the cartoons of today are or can be anyway.  This cartoon will take you and your loved ones back to a funny simple time when cartoons were humorous with lovable characters. I mean who does not love the crazy bumblings of George? I know I do

Trivia: According to wiki
George of the Jungle is an American animated series produced by Jay Ward and Bill Scott, who created The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. The character George was inspired by the story of Tarzan and a cartoon characterization of George Eiferman (Mr. America, Mr. Universe, IFBB Hall of Famer) drawn by a cook on his mine sweeper in the Navy during WW2.

3418475,1,B0018PH3OW,"While the original George of the Jungle was by far not the greatest cartoon ever made, this updating of it takes anything that was remotely enjoyable about the concept and chucks it out the window. Instead, we get a dumbed-down version that reeks of all the typical tropes and artistic style inherent in Cartoon Network productions. The jokes aren't funny, the plots are even worse tripe than the original could ever hope to be, and the voice casting completely obliterated the point of this being a Tarzan spoof. If you like CN's Cartoon Cartoon-style programming, you'll like this just fine.

It lacks the humor of the original and is poorly drawn and animated (although, truth be told, Jay Ward's cartoons were never on the level of Looney Tunes when it came to the actual art work).
