All of these songs are thankfully rearranged a bit. Don't get me wrong I love the Animals records, but that was then and this is now (1998). Burdon in concert improvises lyrics and spoken word bringing new life to these songs. He also stays in touch with the audience the whole night. Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin were also able to do this on their good nights.  The New Animals led by Aynsley Dunbar on drums kept Eric jumping on his toes the whole concert.  ""At The Coach House"" was simply a great club show that was luckily caught on tape. Longtime fans of the Animals still wanting the original clean versions please don't buy this.  It's not for you.",1176595200,4,808,4.482993197278912
