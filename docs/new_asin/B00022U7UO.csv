8020856,5,B00022U7UO,"Movie is creepy, husband loves it. My kids got nightmares from it, husband still stands by it. Five stars, it was brand new, beautifully wrapped and shipped. Got here fast enough to put on the shelf as though I'd never tossed the first copy.",1485561600,,241,4.5
8020857,5,B00022U7UO,"I wish Cosmic Christmas was on a DVD.  I remember watching it when I was a child, and really loving it!",1436572800,,103,3.9047619047619047
8020858,3,B00022U7UO,"I really wanted to buy COSMIC CHRISTMAS and not being on DVD  I purchased the VHS version. I really liked this story as a kid and actually still do. The VHS is far from being perfect, but for the price I paid it would deserve more than 5 stars. The term Dont look a gift horse in the mouth is actually adequate here.",1367971200,,316,4.015873015873016
8020859,1,B00022U7UO,"Video tape arrived as advertised, in original packaging. But quality was sub-standard. Was recorded in LP, so visuals not crisp. Audio was fuzzy, especially voices. Visuals had a dark tint.",1359331200,,189,5.333333333333333
8020860,4,B00022U7UO,We have been looking for Cosmic Christmas since our children 30+ years ago.  We like both little shows for our grandchildren.  They are all not about Santa Claus.,1295395200,,162,4.75
8020861,4,B00022U7UO,"Too many years ago we watched the Cosmic Christmas on TV and then I never saw it again.  I didn't realize it was included with The Littlest Angel. While the quality of the video leaves something to be desired, the story does not.  It is just as sweet and moving as I remembered.",1294012800,2,278,4.226415094339623
8020862,1,B00022U7UO,"Amazon and their unfortunate ""Marketplace"" vendors seem to be illiterate as they cannot read the product title on the video boxes!; twice I have ordered this movie and twice I've been sent the wrong product. Please do yourself a favor and write to the vendor BEFORE comitting yourself to this runaround--Amazon does not appear to care enough to verify or cancel these false listings!",1105401600,4,383,5.0
