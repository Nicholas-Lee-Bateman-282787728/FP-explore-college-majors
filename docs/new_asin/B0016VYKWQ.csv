8264206,4,B0016VYKWQ,"This set of 2 films of the ubiquitous Barbara Stanwyck is available in the UK, ironically containing one gem with one dud.

""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"", directed by the famous Frank Capra, is unlike anything that came out of Hollywood ever and this was released in 1933! Barbara Stanwyck plays a missionary's fiance who is captured by a Chinese warlord, played by Swedish Nils Asther. The film explores the clash of the cultures as the western and narrow minded Stanwyck learns to understand the oriental Asther. In Capra annals, it is unique, so different to the sentimental comedies in which he later specialised. He was trying for an Oscar as best picture but the film was too off-beat to have wide appeal and it was not a box office success. It has a dream/nightmare quality and spectacular soft focus photography. Nils Asther is inscrutable and completely convincing in spite of his occidental profile and stature. Stanwyck displays her unusual naturalism and the juxtaposition of her realistic persona to his exotic one makes their relationship unforgettable. The last few minutes of the film are incredibly powerful. You will never forget the closing shot. Walter Connelly also deserves mention as General Yen's Western financial advisor because his performance is one of the unsung highlights of thirties acting. The script helps enormously. This is a film of endless irony and subtlety. The print is very good although at times the contrast is faulty with shiny blacks and glaring whites.

At the other end of the spectrum, 1939's ""Golden Boy"", is a horribly dated and pretentious Clifford Odet's play, directed smoothly by the over-rated Rouben Mamoulian and starring the very immature William Holden, who overacts at times with a vengeance. Holden plays a ""sensitive"" musician who makes a living as a prize fighter. Stanwyck plays the heroine with her usual skill although her accent betrays her Brooklyn roots and the makeup is unflattering. The age difference between the stars (10 years) is obvious so although they have chemistry (Stanwyck helped the inexperienced Holden on the set), they are a mismatched pair. There is a rich array of sterotypes including Lee J. Cobb in an excruciating caricature of an Italian papa, Sam Levene as his son-in-law and Adolphe Menjou particularly poor as the fight manager. The film makes an interesting comparison to ""Kid Galahad"". While ""Golden Boy"" is a more classy production, it completely lacks the excitement of the wham-bam Warner Brother's production if only due to the verbose script. Michael Curtiz was a much more dynamic director than Mamoulian. The print is adequate.

Neither film contains any extras, not even a scene selection. The DVD set can be purchased very cheaply. Buy it for ""General Yen"".",1291766400,,2767,5.090308370044053
