It takes the movie to another level and makes it more believable, or ....unbelievable depending on how you see it.
I also like the fact that this movie is really geared toward females. All the characters are put into situations that changed their lives and I think a lot of women can relate to this.
This film has a Hitchcock feel to it but it also reminded me of the films of John Cassavetes.
If you like suspense and bloody thrillers, this is the film for you! Enjoy!",1477699200,,633,4.3277310924369745

8735725,1,B01675T2G4,"Only managed to watch 10 mins.  10 mins of profanity laced bad acting.  Really bad acting...as in ""would not get cast in your high school play"" bad acting.  Maybe there was going to be a story....but there is no way this cast was going to be able to tell it.",1448150400,,258,4.12

8735727,5,B01675T2G4,"This film was better than most horror movies that i have seen in the past year. The direction of the film as far as the characters is nothing more than spectacular. I mean after all who doesnt like a ..Who done It... kind of movie not to mention the on screen excellent performance by the Nun thats running the school for girls. She gives off the vibe of being straight up but as you see it takes a dark turn into the twisted mind that she has. Still that does not make her the killer and it is just great to see a refreshing horror movie that actually got bad reviews. I give it thumbs up all the way ,it keeps you guessing and entertained all the way through the movie. So if your tired of the same old car running out of gas on some country road and school kids having to spend the night in some old dusty house,then sit back and enter the school for troubled girls you'll be glad you did.",1446508800,,892,4.102857142857143
8735728,1,B01675T2G4,"Well, I couldn't even finish ASMODEUS, it was so poorly done. The actors didn't know how to act (with the exception of 2-3), the ""story"" was ridiculous and so badly executed, it was hard to watch ANY of this movie.
There was this nun who ran a home for ""Wayward Girls""and the girls were all so badly portrayed, one didn't care at all if they made it out in society or not! One girl sucked her thumb all the time, for whatever reason, one girl wore a black, short wig that looked so fake, I don't know what she was trying to accomplish or portray and that's only 2 of the ""wayward girls"", all about 16-17 years old. All of them were pretty bad actors, but none of them had very serious behavioral issues in the story except one, who entered the movie, kind of snarling at everyone and very unfriendly. Then, someone dies, but that doesn't happen until you've had to watch almost 45 minutes of crap! The nun who ran the place didn't wear her habit until about 30 minutes into the movie. If she hadn't worn it, I would've thought she was a reformed prostitute, by the garish amount of makeup she wore all over her face!! I would NOT recommend this to anyone, really, unless you have insomnia, because it put me to sleep, twice.",1446336000,4,1224,4.349344978165939
