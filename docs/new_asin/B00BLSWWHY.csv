5646879,5,B00BLSWWHY,"Glad these finally showed up ! Collected these on laserdisc way back when. Another of those long lost comedy teams that never got their due. But now thankfully, we can view their antics in all their black and white glory.
The collection, however is still incomplete. Looking forward to see if The Cuckoos, So This is Africa (Columbia Pictures), and the assorted short subjects and individual appearances they made as well.",1365379200,5,422,4.957746478873239
5646880,5,B00BLSWWHY,Want to transport yourself back to the twenties or thirties? Well Wheeler and Woolsey are just the ticket. They use comedy at it's simplest but with wit and style. A reminder of bygone entertainment.,1364256000,2,199,4.882352941176471
5646881,5,B00BLSWWHY,"At last we have a colection of Wheeler and Woolsey. Some of these titles have been released on VHS and Laser Disc, but a few have not had an offical release. The transfer on most of the films are good having come from 35mm elements, and I have made some notes on the obvious:

Half Shot At Sunrise: This transfer alone makes the collection worthwhile. For years we have put up with washed out PD dupes that were terrible. Here you have a near perfect print that really shows the production values on this film. A near pristine 35mm print was used.

Hips, Hips Hooray: Not a bad print, some light surface wear but generally good. The Laser Disc release from Image Ent in the 1990's was much better, but you can't have everything.

The Nitwits: A BEAUTIFUL transfer from 35mm elements much improved from the Image Ent Laser Disc.

High Flyers: 35mm transfer that has a lot of surface wear, the Image Ent Laser Disc was much better quaility.

Mummy's Boys: A solid transfer that looks good. I screened this one on a 12 foot screen and it looked great. Much beter than the Image Ent Laser Disc.

So there you have it. The rest of the titles are solid transfers that do not have major issues. In fact, the rare Caught Plastered looks beautiful. Purchase this set, and maybe Warner Archive will release the balance of the films. IE: Cockeyed Cavaliers, The Cuckoos and Silly Billies.",1362873600,33,1377,4.532258064516129
5646882,4,B00BLSWWHY,"The first Wheeler & Woolsey movie I saw was ""Kentucky Kernels"", which is far from their best; in fact, it put me off W&W for a long time.  But then I became interested in Thelma Todd, sexy & doomed star of the Thirties, and bought this collection to get ""Hips, Hips, Hooray"".  It turned out to be a lot of fun, and so I'm gradually watching all the movies in this collection.
It's tempting to compare W&W slightingly to the Marx Brothers because their comedy tends to be anarchic like the Marxs'; but you have to let go of that and accept them for what they are.  They aren't second-rate Marx imitators (in fact, they were on the scene first); they have their own consistent personas and their own comic style.  Wheeler is a fast talker, and Woolsey, surprisingly, is a romantic lead, albeit a rather childish one; and the pair generally have good-guy roles--helping destitute widows, and the like.
So far, I've really enjoyed ""Hips, Hips, Hooray"" and ""Half Shot at Sunrise"".  In fact, ""Half Shot"" seems to have had quite a large budget, with lots of special effects, elaborate sets, and a large cast of extras.  The others have been enjoyable, too, if on a slightly lesser level.

Oh, and Thelma Todd is very appealing in ""Hips"".

Edit:  I should mention that I have had some problems with playback on these discs.  A couple times the action froze, then started up again, and last night ""Half Shot at Sunrise"" stopped (twice) just before the finale (although a few days earlier, it had played perfectly well).  I am returning the set to the vendor, and have ordered another copy.  Hopefully second time's the charm!",1479859200,,1616,4.631578947368421

5646885,3,B00BLSWWHY,"I like early 30's movies. 60% of these were good. 40% were just OK. If your are NOT a fan of Hollywoods ""golden age"" as I am then don't get this collection.",1408665600,,156,3.90625
5646886,2,B00BLSWWHY,"Well, I hate to (again) go against the grain, but I didn't find these movies very funny.  I can see why they've languished in obscurity all these years.  I watched the better part of all 9 movies in this collection & I gotta say I hardly laughed at all.  A few chuckles were the best I could muster up.  Yes, there were a few good scenes, but not enough to justify watching these movies repeatedly.  I especially found the acting of Woolsey (with the cigar) to be forced--contrived--as if he were always aware that he was in a movie.  He over acted, constantly sort of winking at the audience.  I don't think that's right.  Even in slapstick comedy it seems to me that the actors should appear as if they were unaware of the camera.  Now, Abbott & Costello are another matter.  These guys are no Abbott & Costello.  They're more like Laurel & Hardy, another comedy team who don't do much for me.  To all those viewers who rave about Wheeler & Woolsey, I apologize.  I make these comments at the risk of incurring your wrath, scorn & derision.  Yikes.

In closing this diatribe I should say that I'm gonna watch the entire set again, from start to finish, to see if my opinion changes.  Maybe I was not in the right ""mood"" when I initially watched them.  If my opinion changes I'll get my ass back in front of the computer & I'll revise this review.  But don't count on it.",1397260800,4,1372,4.355731225296442
5646887,5,B00BLSWWHY,"I was delighted to discover that the seldom-seen comedy team of Bert Wheeler & Robert Woolsey finally get their due on DVD. Here was a comedy team who were popular with the masses in the 1930's (although not so much with critics), yet you rarely see their movies on TV (compared to, say, Laurel & Hardy or Abbott & Costello). I had heard of them, but never seen their work, much less knew what they looked like. I'm happy to say, that's all changed with this dandy compilation that includes nine of their film classics (they made roughly two dozen during their teaming). Both men did the same vaudeville patter, yet they were quite different. Bert was the naive, wavy-haired one, who often wooed the girl; Bob was the slender, bespectacled, cigar-brandishing (he adapted that as a prop because he didn't know what to do with his hands) one with the wiseguy attitude and trademark cry of ""WHOA-OH!"" For a while, they had a regular leading lady: Dorothy Lee, whose charming, amusing demeanor and Betty Boop-like voice made her a natural for W&W's nonsense. Here's the lineup...
""Half Shot at Sunrise"" (1930) was the boys' first starring feature, and it proved they could carry one without being relegated to supporting comedy roles in musicals. While it's an unevenly paced--and familiar--army vehicle about two AWOL soldiers making trouble wherever they go, it's quite enjoyable. ""Hook, Line and Sinker"" (1930) is a fine early effort about two bicyclists helping out a young heiress revive a rundown hotel (which includes an odd house detective & aging bellboy). Clever publicity makes the place a popular spot, but also attracts the attention of gangsters who use it to stash stolen loot. ""Cracked Nuts"" (1931) could be a blueprint for their later hit ""Diplomaniacs"" as rivals for the throne of a mythical kingdom. Naturally, they're used as patsies by the corrupt officials of the country. There's a funny routine about the towns of ""Which"" and ""What"" that predates Abbott & Costello's famed ""Who's On First"". Look for a smarmy Boris Karloff and silent screen comic Ben Turpin (as a cross-eyed aerial bomber!) here. ""Caught Plastered"" (1931) is a real gem with a breezy story about two stranded vaudevillians who come to the rescue of a lady's pharmacy store. ""Hold 'Em Jail"" (1932) is a kooky prison comedy that benefits from the comic presence of Edgar Kennedy (as the warden) and Edna Mae Oliver (as his sister). Its climactic football game has probably been spoofed better by others (Harold Lloyd, the Marx Brothers or the Three Stooges). But they do enough damage to make it amusing. ""Hips Hips Hooray"" (1934) rates as one of the boys' best. RKO really invested the bucks in this one, a glittering musical comedy about the world of cosmetics. Even W&W perform what is arguably their best song ever, ""Keep On Doing What You're Doing"" with Lee & Thelma Todd. Its climaxed by a zany gag-filled auto race. ""The Nitwits"" (1935) is a murder mystery comedy climaxed by a high-energy fight. Best highlight: The boys trying to outsmart a watchful cop. Two of their lesser efforts round out the collection. ""Mummy's Boys"" (1936) is familiar territory done better by other comedians. The problem seems to be an uninspired script (with the usual cliches of curses, murder & spooky tombs) that generates few laughs. Their last film together, ""High Flyers"" (1937), is at least slightly better, especially compared to the disappointing ""On Again Off Again"". This high society caper about planes and jewel smuggling is at least brightened by some delightful musical comedy moments (Bert's impression of Charlie Chaplin is a real show-stopper) which are more like intermissions from the plot. Lupe Velez, Jack Carson and Margaret Dumont (taking a break from the Marx Brothers) offer fine support. But it's a scene (and jewel) stealing dog who gets the last laugh.
Who knows what the team could have accomplished in the 40's, had it not been for Woolsey's untimely death in 1938. They had a gift for loopy one-liners and musical comedy moments. OK Warner Brothers, let's see some more of their movies get released!",1389225600,8,4102,4.929190751445087

5646891,4,B00BLSWWHY,"Bert Wheeler & Bob Woolsey were a popular cinema comedy team of the 1930s, but are virtually forgotten today.  Alhough both Wheeler and Woolsey were veteran vaudevillians (Wheeler was sometimes referred to as the funniest man in America), they were not a vaudeville team; rather they were cast as a team in the movie musical Rio Rita and built their film career on that.  They always negotiated and signed separate contracts, never as a team.  Their movies were noted for quick vaudeville wit, enthusiastic dancing, and pretty ladies.  The latter was often the vivacious Dorothy Lee, a beautiful firecracker from LA who deserves a full autobiography in her own right, but when Dorothy was unavailable (usually due to marriage) her place was filled by the likes of Thelma Todd, Bebe Daniels, Lupe Velez, and Betty Grable. Edna May Oliver shows up frequently as well.
While their humor is often corny by today's standards, they were quite innovative in their time.  The film Cracked Nuts, for example, contains a gag that was clearly the basis of Abbott & Costello's famous ""who's on first"" baseball routine; it's the exact same joke, except W&W are talking about place names and military units on a map, not ballplayers.  This at a time when, if memory serves me right, A&C hadn't even met yet.  I have movie magazines from the early 1930s that review films from both W&W and the Marx Brothers, and the film critics of the time considered them equals. The team broke up when Woolsey died relatively suddenly from, i think, kidney disease.
This particular set, long overdue, is reasonably priced and boasts good image quality.  My only regret is that the two W&W films that are the hardest to find in good quality copies, So This Is Africa and Diplomaniacs, are not included.  Highly recommended.",1365552000,19,1794,4.875
8570606,5,B00BLSWWHY,This disc set is a must have for any Wheeler and Woolsey fan if only for Cockeyed Cavaliers and their two movies which contain color sequences. The Cuckoos is the better of the two early W&W films which contains two tone color sequences the other film Dixiana has them clearly in support of Bebe Daniels. The Cuckoos also has more color scenes thru out the movie where as Dixiana only has color in the last twenty minutes. Both films also have the beautiful and talented Dorothy Lee who always brought innocent charm and comedy to every Wheeler and Woolsey movie she was in.  One her  favorite films was Cockeyed Cavaliers which takes place in medieval England where Dorothy disguises herself as a boy to escape from a marriage she does not want. She meets up with W&W who are beggars disguised as the King's physicians. Thelma Todd is also around to add to the fun and the whole thing comes to a hillarious end with boys being chased and finally capturing a wild boar which had been terrorizing the countryside. Cockeyed Cavaliers is a W&W classic and is easily the best film on this disc set. Too Many Cooks stars Bert Wheeler and Dorothy Lee as newly weds trying to build a house with too much interference from family members. Everything's Rosie stars Robert Woolsey as a circus conman who adopts a little girl who grows up to be cute Anita Louise. Both films are charming and entertaining. Silly Billies is a lesser W&W vehicle whose main distinction is it was Dorothy Lees last outing with the boys. However it still has a slew of Robert Woolsey one liners and a comic climax with Indians. It may not be PC but it is still funny. So if your a W&W fan don't miss out on the fun and pick up this disc before you become cuckoo.,1524614400,,1730,4.4715189873417724

8570609,5,B00BLSWWHY,"I just bought this set and have watched only two of the movies so far.  I am a W&W fan so I was pre-sold on this set.  I read a book on W&W and it said that Cockeyed Cavaliers was the best W&W movie, so I'm looking forward to seeing that one.  I watched Too Many Cooks, which is not a W&W movie as it was an experiment by RKO to see if Wheeler and Woolsey could each star in a movie without the other.  Too Many Cooks stars Bert Wheeler as a man trying to build a house so he can marry Dorothy Lee.  At first I thought this movie was a dud.  Then I realized it was not trying to be a comedy, but just a light hearted type drama, and I thought it succeeded as that.  The companion film is Everything's Rosy starring Robert Woolsey without Wheeler.  I haven't seen it yet, but it will be interesting.  The other film I saw was The Cuckoos, which is a creaky 1930 comedy/musical full of those fun song and dance routines they do so well.  A great line from this film has a greedy Woolsey trying to romance a wealthy widow who is about two feet taller than him.  She says ""Will you love me till I die?"" and Woolsey says ""Well, that depends on how long you're going to live!""",1510444800,,1170,4.0

The other movies in this set are hit and miss with the gags and jokes, but the transfer and quality of every film here is great. Nothing has been given a grand restoration, of course, but the audio and video are above average, so the viewer can enjoy the absurd antics of Wheeler and Woolsey.",1491264000,3,377,4.478260869565218

8570613,5,B00BLSWWHY,"I love classic Hollywood films, especially the scrappy black and white productions in the 1930s when directors were mastering the new sound medium and the 1934 enforcement of the Production Code hadn't hit in full force. In fact, in early 2017, the New York Times published a fresh review of DVD sets of pre-code movies. These are very entertaining gemsquite refreshing in our current era of big budgets and CGI spectacles.

Although I've loved these films all my life, I was late in discovering Wheeler and Woolsey. Other reviews on this page share some of their background. Well-oiled Vaudeville veterans, movie producers teamed them in a collaboration that clearly was meant to be! If you are reading this review and debating whether to invest in their films, I might suggest you ask yourself if you enjoyed classic George Burns comedy? Well, the cigar-chomping Robert Woolsey evokes a bit of that Burns style, although Woolsey clearly had a greater range of comic, musical and even dancing talent than Burns. The curly haired Bert Wheeler might be thought of as Woolsey's Gracie Allen or perhaps Dean Martin's Jerry Lewis in their funniest movies. What's so great about Wheeler and Woolsey is that both men could crack jokes, warble a clever tune and occasionally carry off carry off dance numbers that usually focus on novelty effects.

I'm also so pleased that Warner Brothers archives produced this collected set with fine copies of the films. These are clear and fun to watch. If you've invested in early movies, you've probably hit a few grainy, poorly reproduced knock offs. This set is high quality.

Enjoy! And don't forget there is a Volume 2 to this series that you may want if you enjoy this first one.",1486598400,,1717,4.893470790378007
8570614,5,B00BLSWWHY,This was purchased as a gift for my husband who is a big fan of pre code films. We've watched a few of the films together and he is very pleased with the quality of the prints. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who is a pre code buff or a fan of vaudeville since many of the skits are reminiscent of those days.,1484611200,3,315,3.8615384615384616
