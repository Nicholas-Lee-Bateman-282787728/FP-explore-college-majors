Perhaps autobiographical (the actress is played by Fellini's wife), it is a mark of both Fellini's insight and imagination that marks the uniqueness of this film. The film also contains all the gothic, surrealist elements of his oeuvre painted, this time, in reverse, that is, from the standpoint of the person dearest to him, his wife. In this sense, it is a bookend to 8 1/2, the exploration of Fellini's own fragmentation.",1447027200,,513,4.840909090909091

1239072,5,B00000JWW7,"It's been called Fellini's best, a stream of consciousness movie like Easy Rider or many others made in the sixties. It has no real plot, but instead ties together many diverse themes and is a delight to audio and visual senses in addition to being a muse for the imagination with the dream scenes, seances and flamboyant minor characters who drift in and out of the lives of the central character, Juliet; married to a movie executive she suspects of having an extra-marital affair-- the kind of problem that winds up being kind of a rabbit she winds up chasing down a hole into a netherworld of mysteries.
I love it. I've watched it many times.",1404432000,,646,4.577586206896552
1239073,5,B00000JWW7,"I sat down to watch this film wondering if it was as good as I recall it being (I saw it about 10 times in the theatre), or if my memories would be based on little more than nostalgia. Well, from the moment I heard the crickets chirping as the camera focused on the jewel box of a white house in its forest of umbrella pines, I was mesmerised from beginning to end. I was particularly thrilled with the sharpness of the transfer; the phantasmagoric images blazed in jewel tones as I played this DVD on the fancy-shmancy Blu-Ray player that my son had given me for Christmas.

Giulietta Massina's performance is both restrained and effortless. With a mere glance of her eyes, she conveys a wealth of inner emotions, disappointment, embarrassment, distress, anger, wonder. We are experiencing--from her character's point of view--the sense of rejection she has suffered both as a lonely child, and as an even lonelier wife, as she copes with the glib evasions of her handsome philandering husband. The overblown couture of her ice-cold mother and superficial sisters as well as the outrageously sexualised fashions of her glamorous neighbour are projections of what she perceives as her own modest insignificance, although, at the same time, her own dressing in vivid reds and greens indicate that she feels that the eyes of others are always upon her.

As much as I enjoyed watching the film after so many years, I did notice that some of my favourite bits were missing. Some of these are minor, as when Giulietta, coming home from the psychic reading of the androgynous Bishma, becomes hypnotised by the broken lines on the road which seem to move while the car seems to stand still (her friends have fallen into a deep sleep). Others, however, were really disappointing, as when the child Giulietta recalls playing the part of a Saint in the school play and being hoisted up on her fiery grill towards the window of God. The unforgettable visions of the weeping statues, who were dripping with melted candle wax tears, had--inexplicably--been cut in this version.

Some of my favourite images: Giulietta and her maids stringing red and green peppers for the winter (I took up the practice after seeing the film the first time); the Roman umbrella pines (I think some scenes were shot in the Pineta--the pine grove--of the Villa Doria Pamphili); the rose trees covered in plastic sheets after her marriage disintegrates, and of course, the weeping wax-covered statues, which are, except for one peep, no longer there. (I suppose I'm now going to have to find whether there's an uncut version.).

Despite the flaws, I still give the film five stars, as it held me spellbound from beginning to end.",1402790400,,2696,4.841648590021692

1239075,5,B00000JWW7,"When this film came out in the sixties I was so taken with it I saw it about seven times while in the local theater on it's first run. I took my girl friend to see it after i saw it, I took my mother to see it. I saw it alone again, I went with other friends. This is one of Fellinis's finest films, it is not as meandering as Eight and a Half which is such a classic but more potent for me anyway, and has a delightful sound track that is worth owning on its own. I have since watched it many more times after long passages of time and it always holds up for me. Every time I see it I see something new or think of it in a new way.

1239077,4,B00000JWW7,"Or is it his first?
My understanding of Fellini's arc is a bit precarious, but what is unmistakable about this ""Genius"" is the fact that there ARE TWO FELLINIS........Number ONE is his heartbreaking, profoundly transcendental ""neo-realism"" of ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria""-------and his ""depraved"" CIRCUS of his SECOND phase, one that is deeply flawed and sometimes so self-indulgent that you almost give up on him entirely------re: ""Satyricon"" and that piece of TRASH called ""ROMA"".......
At first, you are bewildered by the ""non-plot"" of this film----and IT IS a movie without a plot. Nothing in itself wrong with that, but it takes you awhile...........to finally warm up to the child-like delight of its VISUAL SPECTACLE----------and that's ALL IT IS......Pay no attention to the so-called Freudian unconscious explanations, so much Mumbo-jumbo, and concentrate on the wonderful sets, the exquisite costumes, the BIZARRE spectacle (of which you sometimes don't know when they are dreams or reality) and for 1965 more than a bit risque sequences like quite a fascinating romp with Lesbianism, poor Giulietta always caught up in the middle of it all, helplessly going along with the show.
Oiled muscular hustlers, a castrating, soignee mother wearing the most SPECTACULAR of costumes, effete homosexuals carrying on nonsensically, magnificently manicured gardens, parties in which everybody has a scandalous role to play, SEANCES in which the dead talk to you, and a repulsive old female medium offers empty words, the movie will test the patience of even the most sophisticated.
And at the center Giulietta Massina, Fellini's wife and star of ""La Strada"", ""Nights of Cabiria"", and others I believe. Massina is a sweet confection, and you are delighted and always seemingly heartbroken at her lack of will, and victimized roles...Yet, I had never realized Massina's very limited range until after seeing this film. She smiles, she looks lost, she's impotent, she gets run over by life and everyone, and yet she barely gets by with two or three expressions. Mind you, they are magnificently TENDER and profound expressions, but Vanessa Redgrave she IS NOT (how cruel of me....).
For all its flaws it ultimately turns out to be a very good work of entertainment, exquisitely shallow, and yet entirely ORIGINAL.........",1362614400,,2324,5.335149863760218
1239078,5,B00000JWW7,"I find that criterion always offers the best copies of films. I trust them to respect the original movie and to leave it unaltered while presenting the clearest, best print. This offering lives up to my expectations. It is the best!",1362528000,,232,4.682926829268292
1239079,5,B00000JWW7,"... but not a ""woman's film""! That is, the only real person -- emotionally plausible, flesh and blood, accessible to empathy -- is the focal character Giulietta. The other women in the film are chimaera -- Jungian 'animae' injected into Giulietta's hallucinations from the phantasmagoria of Federico Fellini's mind. They're the images of a man's mind, that is, and not a woman's. Actress Giulietta Masina (in real life Fellini's wife) plays out the affect of her namesake character so convincingly that many viewers might not object to the essentially 'macho' nature of her supposed visions. That's the most serious flaw in the film, in fact a fatal flaw if you want to fathom, analyze, make sense of all the weirdness Fellini packed into his first color film and what you might call the first of his last films, each of which would become increasingly garish, lush, and lurid.

On the other hand, perhaps that was what the old maestro had in mind -- to create a cinema vehicle for his Muse Giulietta Masina wherein she could be her sane and perhaps ordinary self in the circus fantasticus of her husband-director's imagination. That would imply, mind you, that he made the film entirely to be meaningful to an audience of two, with the rest of us merely ticket-buying voyeurs.

And speaking of circus, this 1965 film reminds me in 2011 of a production by Cirque du Soleil -- Varekai, for instance -- with all the gaudy costumes and lascivious clowning, but without any of the physical circus tricks. What must have seemed outrageously florid and decadent in 1965 no longer seems quite so exotic. Honestly, some of it is simply kitsch and some is extraneous.

No, it isn't entirely coherent or cohesive, but some of the fault may lie with odd cuts in this DVD release; that's what several earlier reviewers have suggested. I saw the film in Rome in 1966, but I don't remember it so well that I could identify missing scenes. ""We"" were receptive to lurid and lewd in the mid '60s -- those of us, I mean, who had survived the drab and prissy '50s -- and Fellini suited us perfectly. I've watched two Fellini films -- this one and La Dolce Vita -- with a couple of 20-years olds recently, and they both nearly died of boredom while pretending to humor me.",1320969600,,2252,4.681818181818182
1239080,5,B00000JWW7,Mr. Fellini's first film in colors...it is just superb. Ms. Masina is perfect allowing us to enter into Juliet's most profound existence. Every photograph in this film is a piece of art. It is exquisite!,1307836800,,203,4.828571428571428
1239081,5,B00000JWW7,"When I first saw this film at age 30, it left me depressed. However, as another Amazon reviewer mentioned, the films of Fellini require one to have ""lived a little""--and I have to agree. Because when I re-discovered this film in my early 40's, I fell in love with ""Juliet of the Spirits"". Giuletta Masina gives a performance that is both introspective and commanding as ""Giuletta""--a character who, while maintaining a healthy core of sanity, is often troubled, tormented and questioning in her search for the enlightenment that will set her free.  Nino Rota's soundtrack on its own is brilliant and buoyant--as well as an integral part of the film.  I also agree with several other Amazon reviewers who observed that JOTS exists as a complement to Fellini's previous and better known masterpiece, ""8 1/2"".  JOTS provides the alternate, emerging feminist viewpoint missing from ""8 1/2"".  JOTS, as evidenced especially by the final chapter (Chapter 25) of this DVD, also foreshadows the excesses of ""Satyricon"". There is even an homage to Ingmar Bergman at the end of The Circus Montage (Chapter 11)--which I noticed only after several viewings. In that scene, Giulietta's grandfather is running across the top of a hill towards an old-fashioned airplane, along with the dancer/circus performer (Sandra Milo) and several others; I see this scene as a comic parody of Death leading away certain characters in Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"".

There are so many scenes in JOTS that I continue to find moving, mystifying and exhilirating after repeated viewings--highlights include the following: The Seance/Evocation of the Spirits (Chapter 3);  Giuletta's Dream/Nightmare at the Beach (Chapter 4); The Circus Montage (Chapter 11); Giuletta as a Little Girl on the Fiery Rack in Hell in the Nun's School Play (Chapter 15); The Melancholy Musical Montage during Suzy's Party (Chapter 21); Giuletta's Talk with the Psychoanalyst (Chapter 22); and Giuletta's Final Confrontation with the Spirits (Chapter 25).  In Chapter 10, Giuletta encounters the hermaphroditic medium Bishma in a room that is significantly painted red. In this scene, Fellini uses the humming of a standup fan as a sound effect in the background.  In this same scene, the sound of the wind, which Fellini makes use of frequently and compellingly in many of his films, arrives with the spirits.  As evidence of how real life informed the creation of this often surreal film--the following is a quote from ""Notes"" by John Baxter in the booklet enclosed in the Criterion DVD of ""Juliet of the Spirits"": ""The Fellinis shared a profound belief in psychic phenomena"".  In closing--to enjoy this film to its utmost, I recommend ""suspension of disbelief"".

1239082,4,B00000JWW7,"There have been many attempts to explore the layers of shackles that inhibit,  cage,  strangle the wondrous, unique God-created self that is meant to be fully alive in all its human dimensions. Juliet,  played by Fellini's actual wife,  Gullietta Masina,  is this beautiful, good, woman - wife, mother, etc. who has many forces battering her true self from all sides.  Fellini takes us on a journey of the many ersatz freedom trails and explosive experiences that today's world will offer to ""set one free"" - all proving false,  fake,  empty,  desperate,  rip-offs if one seeks the real thing,  junk food if one is seeking soul-food.  All of it done in gaspable color,  bizarre settings and imagery,  in what has led to the very word,  ""Fellini-esque"".  Her cheating husband is leaving her. Her physical, mental world is crumbling.  Little glimpses of sanity flash here and there in quick scenes of a grandfather, crazily bearded and wickedly playful who is running away with a beautiful, very buxomy showgirl in a bi-wing plane;  and the sanity of a father roaring onto the stage during the performance of a school play to extract his daughter Juliet who is portraying a martyr on a bed of flames. The father is shouting against the horror and cruelty of such things being presented as part of religion. The ""carpe diem"" grandfather,  the ""protect them from fire and brimstone"" father  -  veritable salvation images. Fellini's  delightful comedic spirit linked to his at times melodramatic, and justifiably critical attitude towards religion.  WE watch as Juliet teeter-totters on the brink of insanity and suicide.  But it all stops as she says NO to an inner voice command her mother gives her,  then NO to other forces ""do this, should do that"" in her life ....... and then nods she begins to nod  YES  to  Juliet,  to one thing, then another  ....  and with stronger and more deliberate steps,  walks out of the country house, which looks very much like an ""everything-in-its-place"" doll house.  Juliet walks serenely in the grove of tall pine trees - in the  truth of her own life .... in the only truth that sets us free.  In the background is the jaunty music of Nino Rota,  Fellini's most frequently used composer.  Life is once again affirmed.  Life with a serenity,  a peace,  a strength.
After La Dolce Vita,  Fellini's big success, he made  81/2,  which entered Fellini's own torment as director with creative block. [The musical Nine is based on the movie 81/2.}  Juliet of the Spirits,  followed 81/2, and is  Fellini's first movie in color. It is the exploration of a woman's soul.  But also a commentary on the shaping of one's self - which applies to man or woman.  There are truths here that are of a depth that may well be further than Fellini's own awareness.  But like in all true art -  the resonances -  the frissons that result,  are the fruits of true art.  And of these fruits we are all invited to partake and stretch our spirits and thus become ever more embrasive of all that is human ......",1285113600,,3021,4.720616570327553
1239083,5,B00000JWW7,"Juliet of the Spirits is just so fun to watch over again. I had a script writing class teacher that liked Casablanca so much he always watched it again to peel another layer out of the story.  For the same reason, the symbols are so great in this film you love to look at it again to figure out what they mean. I find a published version of the script and read it along with the video. This tape contains the edited scenes in the circus where the lover of Juliet's grandfather worked, and the awesome armor plated death warriors hiding with their boat in the water.",1265673600,,565,4.280373831775701
1239084,5,B00000JWW7,"This is a great colorful wonderful film, with a new translation that comes much closer to the Italian language original.  I have seen in many times in the theatre and own both the original VHS and the Laserdisc version.  When the newest (2002) dvd version was released I bought it immediately and was astounded at finally seeing it a fully restored and newly translated version.  There is a wonderful flow to this film, despite what sounds like an Italian dubbed soundtrack, many times the voices do not sync up with the visuals, but this is minor.  The color is sumptuous, the story intriguing and haunting, and the characters hysterical and very memorable of the swinging 60's.  If you find credibility stretched because Giuletta is shorter than her sisters and mother, go with the flow.  While the plot and denoument is not what would be called ""profound"", this is especially wonderful for the portrait of an old-fashioned Italian house-wife amidst a philandering husband.
For a fascinating comparison, see Michelangelo Antonioni's magnificent ""The Red Desert"" of the same year and essentially a similar concept of dislocated housewife amidst the debris of modern life.",1261872000,,1172,5.109947643979058
1239085,5,B00000JWW7,"I don't think that there is a lot to add to other reviews.  This is a classic.  If you like Fellini, you will like this.  This was made when Fellini was riding a real wave of surrealistic creativity.  One does have to pay attention amid the circus-like carrying on to note the underlying story of the self-centered protagonist.",1239494400,,327,4.586206896551724
1239086,3,B00000JWW7,"Federico Fellini's first color film, 1965's Juliet Of The Spirits (Giulietta Degli Spiriti), which was written by Fellini and longtime collaborators Tullio Pinelli, Ennio Flaiano, and Brunello Rondi, is, simply put, the female and color companion piece to 8. Unlike that prior film, often considered Fellini's best, Juliet Of The Spirits was a critical and financial failure when it came out. The criticism of the film was too harsh for, while it is not as great nor good a film as some earlier Fellini classics, it is still Fellini, which makes it better than the overwhelming majority of films by others, for even when Fellini fails he succeeds at more things than most. However, like many of the first color films made by directors who started in black and white, Fellini seems to overdose on the new medium, with color schemes that seem off the charts, and which tend to bleed over into one another. However, given the oneiric quality of the film, this is not necessarily a bad thing, especially since this was at the start of 1960s psychadelia, and Fellini was supposedly affected by an LSD hit at the time.
  Basically, Juliet Boldrini (Giulietta Masina- Fellini's real life wife) is a bored housewife who rightly suspects her wealthy public relations husband Giorgio (Mario Pisu) of infidelity, after their anniversary, when he mumbles another woman's name- Gabriella, a 24 year old model he's squiring around. Whereas the film, before this scene, was realist in the way that much of La Dolce Vita was, the seeds of doubt that are planted play havoc with Juliet's mind, and much of the rest of the film takes place entirely in Juliet's head. Even seemingly realistic scenes, such as when Juliet hires a detective agency to follow Giorgio and Gabriella, are tinged with psychodrama and images of repression, which make the viewer question if they are `real' in the film's cosmos, or merely the fantasies of Juliet trying to nail her cheating husband. Aside from her faithless husband, Juliet has other people's idiocies to contend with- such as a neighbor, Suzy (Sandra Milo), who is an old nymphomaniac who may or may not hold orgies- this is never certain, for this may be a product of Juliet's imagination, in her palatial home. There is also her attraction to and influence by the occult- which stands in direct contravention to her character's beliefs in Nights Of Cabiria, where Cabiria mocks the believers in religion. Juliet also has a cold mother, a boorish sister, and repressed memories of a Roman Catholic childhood that have scarred her in some way- possibly involving sexual abuse from an older male relative, although this is also unclear since the symbolism of the scene that explicates this is not definitive, and is open to more than one interpretation. However, the implications of abuse seem clear, and the way Juliet reacts to sex throughout the film do seem, to a modern eye four decades down the pike, like a textbook case of post-traumatic stress disorder in reaction to sexual abuse.... Cinematographer Gianni di Venanzo seems to have been overwhelmed by the newness and use of color and spends too much of the film aping some of the distorted point of view shots that Ingmar Bergman's cinematographer Sven Nykvist perfected, only not as well as Nykvist. Even Nino Rota, Fellini's masterful musical composer, seems to be lost through most of this film where the film's visual images are often at emotional odds with Rota's score, which ranges from gorgeous classical music to atrocious jazz scats. Fortunately, despite her character's dourness, Masina again shines in this role, as she did in her earlier Fellini classics, La Strada (as Gelsomina) and Nights Of Cabiria (as Cabiria). Playing someone discomfited through the film is not an easy thing, yet never does the viewer think she is acting. While the screenplay may be overdone, Juliet's reactions to what is going about her are perfectly consistent with how a normal person would react to such bizarreness. This is quite a bit more than one can say with Woody Allen's dull re-imagining of this film, a quarter century later, with Mia Farrow as the titular Alice.
  While Juliet Of The Spirits is not a masterpiece like Nights Of Cabiria nor La Dolce Vita, it is not a failure, and holds up much better than the similarly themed Robert Altman film from 1977, Three Women, where we get the mental breakdown of a single woman who fantasizes herself into the lives of two other women. Juliet never goes that far, yet the film is never as resonant as Ingmar Bergman's more brilliant film from the same year, Persona, in showing the inside out destruction of a mind, for Juliet never gives in, even as she is being targeted, it seems, for destruction from the outside in; and while that might make her a more admirable character than the pair of women from Persona, it does not make for as compelling a film. Juliet Of The Spirits is therefore a good and interesting film, one that will likely reveal a few hidden depths upon rewatch, despite its flaws, but it is not one for the pantheon. However, as a failure, and from a master, it is still leagues above many of the jewels in the crowns of lesser filmmakers. This is something about Juliet Of The Spirits that is perfectly appropriate.",1221264000,,5272,4.847946725860155
1239087,5,B00000JWW7,"One of Fellini's most accessible films (his use of color really helps), he once again plays reality against an active fantasy life... fantasies that combine memory, fears, fleeting desires and the way we imagine the lives of others.  For me, one of the things that makes a film 5 star is that it provides something that only film can provide, and this is it; while the presentation is very theatrical, this quick intercutting of time/memory/mood can only be done in film.

  While the overall message is a very conservative (pre/anti-feminist) one of it's day, Fellini DOES liberate a woman's fantasy life, and this is the essence of his leading ""little woman.""  The predominant action of the film is in her imagination.

  This was the day when middle/upper class Italian women did not work, and Masina represents the ""good little woman.""  Rich enough to have servants, there was little to occupy her time or mind, other than similar friends who have veered to the outre and wierd just to have something to do.  Masina's character searches more internally, and her fantasies color her vision of the lives of others.  (Note that her usual circle of friends are equated with a fantasy of death, and you'll be clued into her psyche as these begin.)

  I think you have to have lived a bit to ""get"" Fellini - I didn't like his work when I was younger - I love this.  Also note his use of color as ""percieved color"" not literal color and this is worth many viewings.

  And finally, if you are a larger woman... nothing makes you feel so great about being a large woman as watching Fellini's glorious Amazons!",1176163200,,1605,4.671428571428572
1239088,5,B00000JWW7,"This was the first Fellini film I ever saw and I was awestruck. I saw it ironically on a videotape that my English teacher had taped it off of public television- channel 11 here in Chicago. However, she had erased over it(the first 3/4 of the movie), as I had asked her if she could tape the season finale of the first season of ""Twin Peaks""-whoa, I'm dating myself! Thank you Mrs. Cantrell for introducing me to a master director and shaping me into what I am today; though I always tended to favor the weird, whimsical and offbeat. So, I immediately rushed to the video store and rented out a copy of ""Juliet""(""Giulietta degli Spiriti,"") so I could watch the first part. The print on the video was pretty old and faded but I've been enjoying Criterion's excellent remaster. This dvd is stunning and the colors are so vibrant. It just reminds me of an Easter, pastel fantasy- all that is transgressing in Juliet's disturbed mind.

  In the opening scene, Juliet sets up for a romantic evening with her husband to celebrate their wedding anniversary but instead is disappointed when Giorgio comes home with an entourage of their freinds. Later, Juliet and freinds engage in a seance session with the assistance of Genius, the mystic. It is determined that Juliet is also gifted and has sort of a sixth sense and gravitates to spirits. Iris, a spirit that has surfaced from the seance follows Juliet throughout the film and becomes her conscience. Juliet escapes in her fantasies and hears so-called spirits may lead the viewer to believe she has gone off her rocker! Juliet's visions and or images vary from the beautiful to frightening. She's a tormented soul since her younger days as her childhood freind Laura committed suicide for love. Now as a lonely housewife she witnesses her husband calling out another woman's name as they lie in bed together. She suspects her husband is having an affair and hires private investigators. Juliet also appears to have an inferiority complex towards her overcritical mother and more ""successful"" older sister. In the interim Juliet befreinds Suzy, the lady of the villa next door. Suzy head of the bordello style household throws extravagantly lavish orgy filled parties and immerses Juliet in her freinds, weird play acting, sex and wine and even sets Juliet up with her nephew for an evening rendevous. Juliet struggles with her self; she desires to fulfill her lust for sex and man but the spirit of Laura is persuading her not to act upon her desires as it is sinful.

  Will Juliet find her inner peace? Will the spirits guide her or is it just all in her world of fantasy she has created for herself to escape from harsh realities of life including her husband's infidelity. Or will she follow the path of her childhood freind Laura who is in eternal peace.

1239090,4,B00000JWW7,"Juliet of the Spirits is a film that contains such lush colors, such nice cinematography, and enough visual, dreamlike imagery that it's a shame it all covers a rather emotionally shallow interior. The film has too much of a whimsical feel to it to really cut deep into the human psyche, but often times Fellini fills the screen with such nice imagery that you can excuse most of the film's shortcomings. Similar to 8 1/2 (1963), but from a woman's standpoint, Juliet of the Spirits is mostly an interesting experimentation in color and image because Fellini has a hard time finding the emotional core that makes his best films work so well. Still, Juliet of the Spirits is enjoyable, especially to look at, and there are a few scenes that will leave you in awe.",1129334400,,762,4.651851851851852
1239091,5,B00000JWW7,"I cannot wait to get my hands on my next adventure into the world of Fellini. I was more than impressed, I was captivated. I watched Giulietta degli spiriti (aka Juliet of the Spirits) and I couldn't help but think of other directors that have used Fellini's tactic in today's modern cinema. I think the reason I enjoyed this film so much is because I love the work of these directors, and I could see the homage they were paying in their films to Fellini. I am speaking of directors like David Lynch, Oliver Stone, and Akira Kurosawa. The colors, the images, and the overall elements of this film are original and provocative at the same time. You wouldn't expect this film a film created in 1965. I didn't when I put this film into the DVD player, but then I wasn't sure what to expect when I put Fellini into the player.

The colors are one of the boldest marks of the film. For this to be Fellini's first color film he pulls it off like a professional. The darkened shades to represent insecurity and the unknown, while the bold colors represent happiness and control. You wouldn't expect these emotions could be combined with ease, but Fellini's master brush never misses a beat. This film is told through its colors. From the opening scene where Juliet is choosing which color hair to wear, all the way to the ending where she leaves the bright white house into the darkened unknown, it is the vivacious colors that lead us from point A to point B. The characters are important, but these colors are used to represent the true emotions of the characters even when they are lying to themselves. These colors tell the truth and Fellini controls them.

I was always a believer that Oliver Stone's style of filmmaking was absurd and at times random, but little did I know that his odd placement of certain images is nothing more than a deep homage to Fellini. Since I have only seen one film, Giulietta degli spiriti, I can only take reference to it, but there were moments when I could have guessed Stone's hand was somewhere in the process. When Juliet sees the spirits, we are suddenly whisked away to a world of haunting images and imagination. We are afraid, yet excited at the same time. The scenes that come to mind are those when Juliet is at the beach and at the end when she finally confronts her demons. While some may see these as a director's ""wet dream"", I saw these as an insight into Juliet's character. We learn about her troubles, her life, her childhood, and her fears. It is these spirits that help us understand why Juliet is the way that she is, and why she has trouble leaving her cheating husband. They are a ""guardian angel"" for Juliet, ensuring that she stays true to whom she is even when times seem to be closing in on her. This is seen when she was about to do something sexually that she had not intention of doing. A moment of revenge saved by a spirit.

This was a magnificent story that could be retold today and appeal to mass audiences. Juliet is the common person, dealing with issues that face us today. The horror of discovering your husband is cheating on you and the spirits that you consult to help. Juliet is neither insane nor crazy, nor would I consider this a ""tale of terror"". This is a story about a normal person who is placed into extraordinary events that cause her to regress to her childhood. This also brings out the spirits from her childhood to help her in her bumpy path.

This is not to say that this film is without faults. While Fellini has obviously mastered the field of directing, showing us with bold colors and creative storytelling, there is something that could be said about his choice of music. I feel that the music used in this film conveyed a message opposite of what was to be felt. I felt that when we were to be shocked or surprised by Juliet, there should be equal music playing, but instead all I head was this happy go-lucky tune that seemed to trample the overall theme of the film. Perhaps Fellini used most of the money for the colors and story and only had one record left for the soundtrack of the film. Who knows? All I know is that the music used did not work in this film at all. If I could change one aspect of this film to bring it to perfection, it would be the score. What was Fellini thinking?

 I would like to say that this first Fellini experience has been magical. I am glad I have the opportunity to share it with everyone, and if you take anything from this review it should be two things. First, don't insult a film until you have viewed it in its entirety, you never know what gems may just need to be polished to glimmer. The saying, ""Never judge a book by its cover"" applies to films as well. Second, go back to the basics. As I watch more and more older films, I begin to wonder the originality and uniqueness of the directors today. Some of the top performers in their game are beginning to show signs that they have ""borrowed"" from other directors. Perhaps they are paying homage, but perhaps there is more. Instead of walking out of a theater and saying, ""WOW! I wonder why the director put that shot in there"" (cause I know all of you think this), perhaps sit back and think about who they are saying ""thank you"" to. You may discover, as I have, that the original creative mind, no matter the date, can still be a powerful force in cinema.

1239092,5,B00000JWW7,"If I had to make the most careful analysis of the impressive career of the freest director in any time, certainly I would not hesitate to select this film among his five top movies.
The Fellini' s first attempt in color resulted in a extraordinary account of the unhappy environment of a wealthy woman, who suspicious of his tricky husband. He is a famous public agent, and advertiser and entrepreneur who loves to cheat his wife arguing professional duties for keeping as longer he can far from home.
In her huge mansion, she is visited for all kind of people. She even, decides to invoke the spirits and hire the services of a private eye to know about the love affairs of his husband.
But this script in the hands of FeFe, reaches a special status, loaded with sarcastic and black humor all the way: she will tempted for two men but she will resist the flesh call.
Nevertheless, the febrile imagination and unstoppable surrealist breath of Fellini, will lead to the intimate memories, painful fears of her vanished childhood of this woman with that Bambi face.
In the road she will meet lovable fatale femmes, exchanging standpoints and allowing herself to visit the fascinating and ludicrous world of some of them. Her childhood memories, her first theater stage, spiritual wounds, disaffects will invade our spirits,souls and mind with such splendid good taste and stylistic elegance as any other related film. In hands of any other director this well known plot would have been another common place, but Fellini makes the admirable journey, employing certainly previous narrative resources  of 8 !/2, and turning in a very personal liberation state what in any other vision could be another personal failure. You will explore the crisis of the mature age, the always present gossip, the discrete and suggestive references to her personal disgrace and the semblance of this strange who recites Garcia Lorca's strophes, specially appropriated for the moment.
Giuletta Masina did it again. Sylvia Koscina is unforgettable in a brief cameo in the first third of the film.

1239094,5,B00000JWW7,"Juliet of the Spirits is perhaps one of the most visually stunning DVD releases I have ever seen. I can only give the highest praise to those at Criterion for this digital transfer. The images are so clear, and the cinematography was so masterfully done that the picture color is what one artist might describe as ""crushed jewels"".

Kaleidoscopic visuals, lovely Italian women, and stereotyped 1960's pop culture hedonism are prevalent throughout. Considering that this movie was released in 1965, one might argue that this movie inspired the formation of certain facets of free love, flower power American society that would come a few years later, including San Francisco's hippie Haight-Ashbury district. Quite interesting is the living establishment of idealistic youths who dwell together, party, drink, and be merry in a house that is essentially owned and run by a middle-aged dominatrix. A viewer, such as myself, now wonders if this movie, in conjunction with the widespread distrust of U.S. political leaders who were perceived by then-teenagers and twenty-somethings to represent an elderly status quo, somehow fostered the creation of communes that would later be developed all over America in remote areas as portrayed in the 1969 classic Easy Rider.

Throughout the movie, the main character, Juliet, who is an Italian  housewife well into her thirties, becomes disillusioned with life when she is strongly suspicious that her husband is carrying on an extramarital affair. In trying to confront her ever-surmounting distrust, Juliet leaves her home to find out if her spouse is cheating on her. Simultaneously, Juliet is also going on a journey of self-discovery through astrology, an androgynous fortune-teller, dabblings with the occult, and acquaintances with multinational, sun-worshipping ladies and gents of the world. The avenues that Juliet enters as the story proceeds from one scene to the next all serve as a conglomerated mix that will help her determine how important her marriage is and whether it is an asset or hindrance to fulfilling her ultimate needs in life.

Juliet of the Spirits, as I have read, was largely panned by critics who were accustomed to Fellini's masterpiece forerunners, including La Dolce Vita and 8 . Almost forty years after the fact, a reviewer nowadays may likely have a much deeper appreciation for Fellini's brilliance in this movie. If nothing else, one who has seen this film will have many a strong case to suggest that 1960's Italy was, in a large way, the pop culture engine of the world.",1105660800,,2551,5.184466019417476
1239095,5,B00000JWW7,"I like 'Juliet of the Spirits' every bit as much as 8 1/2 (is this blasphemous?). It is truly a unique experience and one that proves Fellini and Gianni di Venanzo (director of photography) are equally at home shooting in color as they are in black and white.

The film also raises a lot of questions (like every great film). What are the spirits? Did Giulietta create them? Is it her unconcious mind? Is she simply going crazy? When things go wrong in a relationship do we try to slip into the world of imagination in order to make up for a love that isn't real? What is reality in this film?

Anyway, this is really one of the most visually stunning movies you will ever see - especially as criterion has restored it - a must see.",1095033600,,732,4.297101449275362

Juliet of the Spirits is truly my favorite Fellini film.  The camera visuals and color are stunning.  The wide screen format is imperative.  I only wish that Criterion had also added the (bad) English language soundtrack.  It's better for first time viewers.  Some of Fellini's imagery is easily missed by reading too many subtitles.",1062201600,,474,5.090909090909091
1239097,3,B00000JWW7,"While I admire the cinematic beauty of ""Nights of Cabiria"" and even its plot (as threadbare as it is, it's still good fun), by the time Fellini got to Juliet of the Spirits, he had really run out of things to say. Early on in the movie, there are harbingers of a plot, some suspense and even something verging on high drama, but none of these pan out, and instead we are left with.......a mess.
Giulietta Masina is a very great actress, it is just that there wasn't much material for her to work with. It is too bad she hitched her wagon to husband Fellini's star her entire career, because if she were just in a few movies with plots, character development and finely crafted dialogue, we could have discovered the full range of her talent.
In 1965, when this movie came out, there weren't so many movies about a woman's ""midlife crisis"" and her quest for ""fulfillment""; By now this plot has become a cliche. As far as the story line goes, ""Juliet of the Spirits"" has got to rank among the worst, even losing out to the B-movies and straight-to-video films that are grist for the mill on Lifetime and The Oprah Channel.
And that is really a shame, because this is one of the most gorgeously filmed movies I've ever seen. Director of Photography Gianni di Venanzo's use of Technicolor is breathtakingly fascinating for its sumptuous use of warmth and its balance of colors and use of shocking hues. It rivals movies such as ""Fantasia"" and ""Vertigo"" for its artistic *visual* excellence.
Yet, this movie taken as a whole is rambling, unfocused and pretentious in a genre that is not too difficult to master. Some call Fellini's movies ""surrealistic,"" and I have no argument with that. Perhaps my bourgeoise temperament lacks the patience to put up with it in two-hour-long doses. I prefer my surrealism in visual stills from Dali, Man Ray, Magritte.
The irony of it is that the best movie of the ""woman finding herself"" genre -- ""Shirley Valentine"", directed by Lewis Gilbert -- is filmed so dryly that it borders on incompetence. Imagine what a movie that would have made were the script put into the hands of di Venanzo and Fellini with a soundtrack by the great Nino Rota.
Altogether, viewing ""Juliet of the Spirits"" can be a pleasant experience, so long as one is concerned with camera work, editing, color timing and music.",1047513600,,2327,4.650485436893204
1239098,4,B00000JWW7,"One of the most colorful and imaginative film worlds to visit are the ones created by Federico Fellini. Fellini was dazzling audiences and bringing enjoyment to them through such films as ""Amarcord"", ""Nights of Cabiria"" (My favorite of his films), and ""8 1\2"". And speaking of ""8 1\2"" here's a film most people see as the companion piece to. Which is something I can understand.

 ""Juliet of the Spirits"" tells the story of Juliet (Giulietta Masina). A woman in her 30's or 40's, who is beginning to see the world differently, with a little help from her friends, those that are real and those that are not. You see Juliet fears that her husband, Giorgio (Mario Pisu) is cheating on her. And that would crumble Juliet's world, or would it?
  ""Juliet of the Spirits"" is a film that to me is quintessential Fellini. All of the filmmaker's famous traits are here. The beauitful women, caricaturish view of society, and shifting back and forth between fantasy and reality. Plus, Nino Rota's fabulous score put a smile on my face. Then again, I can't think of a time when he didn't do a good job. I feel the score is on par with ""Amarcord"". And what about the cinematography and the art direction! Fellini seems to be spinning his movie magic here. But sadly this was a time in Fellini's career when the critics and the public were starting to divide. ""Juliet of the Spirits"" was not, and still believe is not considered one of his best films. For example his next film after this would be ""Satyricon"". Another movie that had people split. What about ""Roma"", ""Fellini's Casanova"", and ""City of Women""? These are all movies that to some people are proof Fellini lost his touch. But, I don't think that's the case with this movie. It's just too enjoyable. It's too lighthearted. We're put in such a good mood after this, that I just can't understand why someone wouldn't like this movie. And even if we were to cross out the cinematography, the art direction, the music, and Fellini's directing, surely no one can deny that Giulietta Masina's performance carries the film. Even when the film may seem to be getting a bit odd. She holds the film together. And if for no other reason, see the movie for her performance. So, while the lines may be drawn on this one, I think of it as one of Fellini's best film. A real dazzling experience showing us that Fellini was an original.
 This film was nominated for two Oscars; ""Best Costume Design"" and ""Best Art Direction"". And, it won the ""Golden Globe"" for best foreign film.
  Bottom-line: Clearly one of the better films Fellini made late in his career. And for me, one of his all-time best. Great music, wonderful cinematography and a performance by Masina that almost steals the show!",1047081600,,2725,4.652806652806653
1239099,4,B00000JWW7,"How can one resist the smile and acting of Giulietta Masina together with the imagination of her husband/director Federico Fellini?  If you have never seen this team in action, I suggest you begin with ""La Strada,"" and ""Nights of Cabiria"" before diving into the more surreal worlds of this film, ""8 1/2"" or even ""La Dolce Vita.""
Not lacking in several of the thematic and cinematic Fellini trademarks such as a creepy, confused lead male; the circus; the road/mind trip; the spirituality vs. religion strain;  and the huge heart of teeny-weeny Masina, ""Juliet Of The Spirits"" will set you thinking and reaching for the rewind button on your VCR.
Is this a good first choice for Fellini virgins?  I'd say not, as other films (mentioned above) can warm you up to the Fellini style while the pathos is also better presented and sustained elsewhere.

The cinematography of the movie leads the viewer as to what is happening when a wife discovers her husband's infidelity.  She goes back into her childhood detailing accounts of her grandfather's affair with a dancer and how it affected the family and the community.  Guilietta visits an eccentric and flamboyant neighbor and is drawn and fascinated by the way she lives but realizes that this isn't her kind of lifestyle.  She does go to the model's apartment to confront the woman but doesn't find her there but does have a telephone conversation with her.

1239102,4,B00000JWW7,"Federico Fellini's films often reflected an enticing and disturbing dreamworld. ""JULIET OF THE SPIRITS"" is his first color film and it is a delight to see the bright, vivid colors again.  All previous existing prints on tape were deplorable transfers.
Simply put, the story focuses on a wealthy Italian housewife in her 30s and the interior metamorphosis she undergoes as she experiences the passages, events and changes in her life, most notably her husband's unfaithfulness.  A husband she loves.  No words can do justice to the stunning visuals -- cinematography, costumes and production design.
Many film buffs consider this Fellini's best film -- even better than his autobiographical ""81/2"" -- a film that is in many ways the psychological flip side of ""Juliet.""
Fellini was one of only a handful of world class filmmakers that was fully actualized as an artist.  He could not only break the rules, but make new ones.  And no one excelled better than he in visualizing an elliptical, ephemeral dreamstate that still speaks to our deepest feelings in a unique and fresh style.
Nina Rota's fantastical score raises the intensity of the images and nuances the fleeting emotions.  See this great movie for the first time and discover a genius and humanist who painted with light.

Fellini's stunning visuals--the colors and settings, the outrageous dress, and the fantastic score of Nino Rota, makes it seem as if Italy is the most exotic place on earth.
The first time I watched this film I was a bit put off by some of the events that didn't always make sense, as well as the annoying white subtitles that are difficult to read.  But there was something about it that compelled me to watch again. I'm still not sure I understand the ending, or the role of the tall Spaniard, but there are many subtle and wonderful things happening.
The music of Rota is simply captivating.  Most of it is carried by a lilting, swinging clarinet and a quirky organ in an unlikely but very rich marriage.  I'm disappointed to find there is apparently no film score available on CD.
The viewer is treated to the whole litany and range of emotions of a woman suspecting her husband of cheating--and Guilietta Masina, in a great performance, tells it all in her face.
Guilietta also has visions.  Her penchant for the spirts, along with the urging of her kooky friends, (""S/he only comes every seven years!"") leads her to visit a spiritual charlatan, a phony guru, in a memorable and hilarious scene. ""
""Isn't it an apple?""
""No dear, you must see beyond material form.""
Guilietta's friends also try to persuade her to experience love beyond her marriage.  I shan't tell the result but, again, Fellini treats the viewer to many, many exotic and unexpected scenes.
Finally, this film also explores the relationships of Guilietta to her husband, her mother and sisters, her friends, her husband's friends and her maids.  In a sense, this is very much a woman's film. But it's more; it's surreal; it's certainly one for those tired of boring, contemporary films.",1014422400,,2000,4.7936046511627906
1239105,5,B00000JWW7,"Giulietta is a wealthy, mousey Roman housewife who lives on the margins of her own supposed milieu. Dominated by her beautiful, haughty mother (who can barely tolerate her) and her tall and glamorous sisters, patronized by her rich ding-a-ling friends mostly because of her sympathetic nature (but secretly held in contempt by them for her lack of beauty), Giulietta hides instead in her perfect house with her servants--the only people she can really call her friends--and in her fantasies of her marriage to her jetsetting husband, who seems never to be around. As Giulietta comes to suspect what everyone else has known for years--that he is cheating in her--she simultaneously begins to be visited by spirits who seem to have something to tell her. But as she learns more of her husband's infidelities, and comes to examine the emptiness of her own life, Giulietta's spirits seem less like actual supernatural presences and more like manifestations of a descent into madness.

This is by no means Fellini's ""best"" film, but it is the one most people think of when they use the adjective ""Felliniesque."" The fantasy sequences, the striking use of color (particularly orange--this was his first color film, and he really went to town), the decadent Sixties fashions, and the gorgeous stauesque women who seem to have invaded from outer space: they're all here, and many of the sequences in this film have been parodied again and again. Its imitations come for a good reason: the film is utterly absolutely unforgettable. There are sequences in it that are as fine or as memorable as anything Fellini has ever done--particularly the great lawn party sequence, where Giulietta finally breaks down.

There are many things wrong with the film: the script doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times, and the fantasy sequences seem less like something Giulietta would imagine and more like Fellini's usual obsessions (statuesque women, the circus, etc.). And as superbly icy as Caterina Boratto is as Giulietta's mother (""Nice kimono,"" she sneers at her daughter at the lawn party), did he really have to cast actresses twice as tall as his Giulietta to be her mother and sisters? (Even if we are to accept that most of the movie is from her point of view, it still stretches belief.) What makes it all work so brilliantly in the end, though, is the director's sense of filmic narrative drive (beautifully orchestrated to Nino Rota's famous score) and the performance of the lead actress, Giulietta Masina, who makes it all really matter. Although Masina has not been as praised for this role as much as for her work in CABIRIA and LA STRADA, her work here is every bit as fine, and perhaps better for its greater subtlety. Watch her expression the first time she sees one of her visions after she closes her eyes on the beach--or her astounding range in the lawn party sequence as she segues from forced cheerfulness to utter helplessness to rage, and then finally to despair. (When she finally loses it at her guests and screams at them, it's hard to say what is more memorable: her moment of fury or her terrifyingly lost expression when she realizes they haven't even noticed). Although you really should see this on the big screen (and on as clear a print as possible), this is a film every student of film should see.",1013299200,,3319,4.851851851851852

Fellini himself once said that this film was very misunderstood by the european audience and was better received in the EUA, for the motive he gave to the psycological matter of the film. Sequences like Juliet daydreams and saving the child in the little room are impressive.

1239109,2,B00000JWW7,"After ""81/2,"" Fellini came apart as an artist.  And how have the mighty fallen!  Nowhere in film is there a comparable example of an artist at the absolute height of his powers suddenly falling so short of everyone's expectations.  ""Juliet of the Spirits"" happens to be not merely an artistic failure - it reveals a moral failure in Fellini.  Hereafter, his films would become inexcusably more and more self-indulgent.  The filmmaker who made ""The White Sheik"" and ""Nights of Cabiria"" left us so suddenly.  Fellini may as well have been run over by a lorry.",976320000,,557,4.810526315789474

1239111,5,B00000JWW7,"Perhaps no other Fellini film has benefitted more from the sweet, sound passage of time than 'Juliet of the Spirits.' Regarded as an ambitious but indulgent fantasy at the time of its release, critics and audiences were  also unprepared for its strikingly spiritual feminist undertones. The  concept was ahead of its time, and further aggravating its reception was  Fellini's immense budget...which was seen as an extravagance, particularly  regarding the subject matter. The fact that this extravagance was  communicated in blazing color (a Fellini first) only highlighted doubts  about certain allegedly excessive aspects of the film. In any event, the  tone has changed radically over the years. Critics and audiences found  themselves faced with the severe and genuine indulgences of later Fellini  misfires like 'Satyricon,' and came to realize that 'Juliet'was tame in  comparison, and held more sublime treasures than had previously been  believed. A greater understanding of women's issues also facilitated a huge  turnabout in critical perception of this remarkable film over the years.  Now, it seems not indulgent, but rather like the vision of a masterful,  shrewdly-written poem experienced through a carefully-crafted kaleidoscope  of the senses. In many areas, this may one day be considerd to be Fellini's  greatest film...particularly for its visual juxtapositions to the themes he  is continually seeking to elaborate: mysticism, false-spirituality, female  spiritual independence, sexual independence, female fashion excesses,  female-to-female abuse, mother-to-child abuse, the pitfalls of psychology,  the keys of psychology, and...yes...ghosts of all kinds. The underlying  denominator of all these themes is 'spirit,' and Fellini's way of  communicating the many issues so diversely and yet so simply is nothing  short of amazing. Giulietta Masina is sublime...THIS is her finest hour,  for her performance is subtle and elegantly removed from her usual  physical(and just as valid) schtick. In this film, the viewer must look into  the window of Giulietta's soul to perceive her struggle, whereas she made  her struggles quite obvious to us in previous classic performances. Yes,  the sets and costumes are lavish and often racy, but what more than a few  critics are now noting is that all of this lavishness is POWERFULLY  countered by a stark,pervasive desolation, a constant child-like presence  that is not only emanating from Giulietta, but from the very scenery  surrounding her throughout the film. When watched with a careful eye and  heard with a perceptive ear, the effect is nothing short of guttural,  devastating. This DVD version captures all of the magic of a film that  will, perhaps one hundred years from now, be regarded as Fellini's magnnum  opus.
(yes, Rota's score is particularly haunting here).",961977600,,2843,5.5607476635514015
1239112,4,B00000JWW7,"The film was generally panned when it was first released, and you can still see why. It doesn't live up to the standards Fellini set earlier with his early masterpieces ""La Strada"" and ""Nights of Cabiria"" or his later international hits ""8 1/2"" and ""La Dolce Vita."" The visuals are almost hallucinatory, but the story of a repressed middle-aged woman (played by the wonderful Mrs. Fellini, Giulietta Masina)coming to grips with her husband's infidelity and her own childhood demons is woefully underdeveloped and gives Masina very little to do--other than rely on trademark twitches and outlandish costumes. Still, some of the fantasies are mindboggling and incredibly creative. (Ever since I first saw this film, I've wanted to visit a treehouse like the one Juliet's neighbor takes her to.) And I'm particularly fond of the hoards of faceless nuns forcing school-girl Juliet to act out the martyrdom of some saint on a grill--from which her eccentric grandfather rescues his ""little Bifsteak."" Sandra Milo is a vision and fantasy come-true as Suzi, one of the spirits who leads Juliet to eventually free herself. Some of the sixties touches make for fun nostalgia now--like the twisting twins on the beach and Juliet's family's psychodelic couture. Regretfully the film never quite achieves its potential, but it's still well worth a watch. Any Fellini movie scored by the fabulous Nino Rota is worth watching for the music alone. (A previous post claims this to be Giulietta Masina's ""swan song."" Nope...she later co-starred in Fellini's disappointing ""Ginger & Fred."") Regarding the pre-""Criterion Collection"" DVD release; it would have been nice to have a fuller restoration, and this film especially seems ripe for including lots of additional extras that aren't there. I look forward to the new Criterion Collection release!",959644800,,1831,5.252559726962457

1239114,3,B00000JWW7,"First let me say that I'm grateful to have a fairly decent rendition of one of my favorite films.  This film epitomizes what came to be known as Felliniesque - a lavish subconscious ""theme and varriations"" on  the subject of marriage, sensuality and guilt.  It's also the film that  makes the best use of color than any other I've seen.  Because I've  seen ""Juliet"" many times in theaters I can say with some  authority that the DVD transfer lacks the sharpness and vivid color of the  original.  In general it's too dark and focus is soft.  The biggest problem  is the sound which is constantly out of sync by a quarter second (at least  on my player).  I know Fellini always post dubbed his voices but effects  and music were always in sync.  There is also a harshness to the sound and  at times some distortion.  On the plus side, the print had no scratches  and with the exception of a few strange clipped transitions (noticible by  the soundtrack) seems to be the complete film.  I'd have to disagree with  another reviewer here who says that much is missing.  It's basically the  same version remember seeing over the years.  I live in the US though and  perhaps there was a longer Europeon version.  This is one of Fellini's  most hallucinatory pictures.  The combination of hyper-rich color and  costume combined with Nino Rota's curious score make for a completely  unique viewing experience.",954979200,,1401,4.6929460580912865

7913708,5,B00000JWW7,"This marks the first in what i call the psychedelic Fellini period. While 8.5 has a psychedelic flow to it is based on internal dreamlike subjective commentary by the lead. Juliet as well as Satyricon are completely from a dream world with a transformation of the lead. I feel in 8.5 it was more of a breakdown instead of a philosophical journey. Juliet gains knowledge and strength with the psychedelicness while in Satyricon the environment seems to be from another dimension. That being said i feel Juliet falls into the category of the 3 best Fellini films.
With Juilet then Satyricon and into Cassanova- these 3 film mark what i feel is Fellini's peak and he appears to agree as well. There is well documented footage of him saying his most realized films were satyricon and cassonova with Cassonova being his favorite.
I love his earlier films and you sort of have to be familiar with Massinas performance in La Strada to fully appreciate the way Fellini deconstructs her signature roles. By taking away her social identity he makes a powerful move by creating a very dull and aloof character making this the polar opposite of what Fellini fans came to expect from the super animated Massina.
For me the weirder the better and this seems to me to be the first fully Felliniesque film.
This is more like Cassonova in that the audience is supposed to care and sympathize with a single main character. This film seems to mimic Fellinis real life to a certain degree or at least certain problems high profile artist type's go through within a marriage.
While Cassonova gradually gets more and more serious without letting up this film moves in and out of the drama sphere while at the same time always snapping the viewer back into some sort of intentional humor mood by inserting a dreamlike moment.
This is  a perfect film and a must have for serious Felini fans. There is even a horror element which boarders on early horror/comedy.",1521936000,,1937,4.730769230769231
7913709,4,B00000JWW7,"From the opening shot you know this is a master at work. This is a wonderfully cinematic and playful work by Fellini. The problem, I think, is that it feels insubstantial. Sort of like simple plots that pull you along on the poetry of the prose. You keep watching because the sequences are so enthrallingly staged and the cinematography composed with such bravura complexity and sense of movement. But, I dunno, by the end I found my attention wandering. I wondered where it was going and if it could actually go anywhere interesting, dramaturgically-speaking. I do really really like Giulietta Masina here. She has a buoyancy and sense of whimsy to her character, but at the same time can play very quiet devastation. Not my favorite Fellini film but still very good.",1513468800,,768,4.825757575757576

It might be one of the most dreamy movies of Federico Fellini, and, it is for sure his first movie in color and what cinematography! Gianni Di Venanzo's (unfortunately last) camera work is a must see by all film's lovers, costumes and sets could not be more allegorical and sublime, and, the performance of Giulietta Masina who plays of course Juliet, is a labor of love. All the cast is brilliantly chosen too: from Caterina Boratto as the distant mother, to lovely Sylva Koscina and Sandra Milo who both excels here in displaying talent and not just beauty, while, Valentina Cortese, Mario Pisu and all the ensemble are never less than memorable. The script plays with the interiors of the lonely, loving wife of a famed director who seems too busy to worry about her troubles or just about her sheer sensibility, many times dismissed or offended. But, Juliet, against all odds, will take life at a stake and carry on with her chin up, coming to incredible revelations from the past and present that will heal her soul in a beautifully poetic ending of astounding, creative pure film magic. A mysterious, colorfully brilliant, seductive, entertaining, beautifully presented movie that is for me one of the best of the famed Italian director.",1453161600,,1368,4.85042735042735
