My only problem is that the words on the screen are in German. I knew it might be, because the listing said it was from Germany, but I also knew that it was recorded in Australia and the German copy still had the original Australian English version, so I hoped. Not a big deal and totally worth it to have all of the seasons. The seller got it to me quickly (in perfect time for Christmas) and in perfect condition.",1483660800,,587,3.983050847457627
