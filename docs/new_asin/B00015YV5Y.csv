1974000,5,B00015YV5Y,"This DVD is absolutely captivating. It's an adaptation Of

Choderlos de Laclos' book written in the seventeen hundreds.

Directed by Josee Dayan for TV in 2003 I believe. He did an amazing job of bringing the story to modern times. If you love

intrigue, deception, jealousy, sex and pure evil, you will adore this DVD with its magnificant color and scenery. It's just a wonderful film and you will love it. If I could,

I would give it ten stars.",1151798400,3,447,4.55
1974001,5,B00015YV5Y,"This review refers to ""Les Liasions Dangereuses"" - 270 minute extended edition...

I love this story and try to see every version of it that comes out. This one made in 2003, by the wonderful Jose Dayan, is purely exquisite. This tale of deadly seduction is updated and adapted to the 1960's. A good choice by the director, as we get to see it played out differently and although much closer to the present, still gives that feel that 40 years ago, the moralities of the key players might still have been considered a bit of a shocker.

In this update, the story revolves around a Center For the Arts, that is run by none other then the woman we all love to hate, Madame de Mereuil. She and long time, on and off again lover, Valmont scheme and connive to destroy relationships and lives. Revenge is Madame's wish, and Valmont is only too happy to comply with her wishes, knowing that she will be his reward in the end. He is the best when a seduction is at hand. But things get complicated for Valmont, when his heart takes an unexpected turn towards Madame Tourvel. Innocent bystanders, the young Ccile de Volanges and virtuoso musician Raphael Danceny, also get pulled into the web of deceit. Valmont wants out though, and must find the weakness that will put an end to Madame Merteuil. It's a marvelous tale of wickedness.

Now, I know some may agree with me that no one can compare to John Malkovich's take on Valmont, but I must say, that Rupert Everett is quite convincing and actually, physically, takes on the look of the devil himself. And who else but Catherine Deneuve, could follow an act like Glenn Close. Deneuve's take is a little different, she gives Madame a multi-faceted personality that at times is even likeable. So we, the audience, get drawn into her schemes as well. And she is so beautiful, even now, one can hardly take their eyes off of her.
Nastassi Kinski as Madame Tourvel and Leelee Sobieski is Cecile. Both turning in excellent performances. Danielle Darrieux, is Valmont's wise Aunt, who seems to see all.

It's an excellent production. Beautiful and vivid colors that take you back to the 60's. Fabulous costumes, and scenery. Presented in widescreen(anamorphic) and 5.1 Sound in French with English subtitles. It's a three part production. Each part on a separate disc, each running about an hour and a half. Be sure to catch the lengthy conversation with Dayan in the special features.

Play the game once more in this absolutely mesmerizing update.

1974003,2,B00015YV5Y,"Finally watched the Jose Dayan's Les Liaisons Danngereuses, only PART ONE, rather disappointed and bored!

Catherine Deneuve is simply unfit and inconvincing to be the great manupulator Madame de Meurteuil, so much so far way behind Glen Close. The plot of this much adapted novel is already familiar to a lot audience, we need a much beyond fame and beauty screen goddess who can pull it ""agefully"". Say Cher?

I could save some energy for PART TWO though for the continuous charm of Rupert Everett, and ah, those lovely backdrops of French country too.",1119830400,4,554,4.882978723404255
1974004,3,B00015YV5Y,"This is not a great film. It is long, and a bit tired. The sets, the clothes, and the cars are all indeed sparkling. The music is well-played. The color, the taste, the smell, all exude authenticity. Well then, why the mediocre review?

Catherine Deneuve is indeed old. A bit heavy. And not a temptress physically. But I had no trouble with that....part of the theme is that men are easily manipulated, eager to be used, and can be led by their privates. She does so. No, where this film flops is the big change-of-heart transition. I have not read the book, and I thought the Malkovich version dreadful. But I did see a stage version set in pre-revolution France that was absolutely stunning, among the most impressive plays I've ever seen. And the notion so beautifully portrayed there was that the decadence and abuse of these amoral pigs was the cause of their society's collapse. It did not need anything other than their victims to rise up and say ""No more."" Here we need an unconvincing change of heart in Valmont. Why, if he is so easily manipulated, does he start to love? He has never demonstrated anything other than a puppy-dog desire to return to Catherine Deneuve's bed. Will do anything, say anything, hurt anyone. (And why does he want this...was she that good?) But we never see why he changes. Lots of horse riding, lots of sweeping landscapes, but what does he think? No idea.

And a rather contrived twist is necessary to bring Madame de Merteuil down, a twist I found obnoxiously convenient. No, the seeds of death are in the behavior itself, and this tale does not even acknowledge that possibility. Fate and an unconvincing change of heart do the work.",1119657600,18,1675,4.655405405405405
1974005,5,B00015YV5Y,"Clocking in at 270 minutes, this 2003 French film version of Choderlos de Laclos' perennially popular 18th century novel ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses' about the extant concerns of seduction, betrayal and revenge requires not only a long time segment of your life to enjoy, it also requires much on the part of viewer participation to stay abreast of the fascinatingly tangled plot.

Director Jose Dayan has accommodated Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt's adaptation to the screen and in doing so has updated this elegant, high costume drama into the haute couture setting of Paris in the 1960s.  There have been many filmed and staged versions of de Laclos' novel and while they all have had their strong points, for this viewer Dayan's film unravels the plot and the characters with much more finesse and ultimate credibility than the predecessors.

Many have scoffed at the casting of the still gorgeous Catherine Deneuve as Madame de Merteuil, claiming that the author had in mind a much younger femme fatale for this role.  But times have changed, women are more sensually alive in the age realm of Deneuve, and for me the casting is perfect:  here is a woman of the world who is not just out to spar with Valmont (another very well cast Rupert Everett) in a deadly game of lover's vengeance, she is also facing the fact (like the Marschallin in 'Der Rosenkavlier') that her wealth and aging beauty are on the wane and that makes her a much more fleshed out character.

The story is well known:  Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil, once in an affair years ago with Valmont and remaining in an approach/avoidance relationship with that libertine in a very dangerous liaison, has been rejected by her long standing lover Gercourt (Andrzej Zulawski) for the beautiful young pianist Ccile de Volanges (Leelee Sobieski).  de Merteuil convinces Valmont to seduce and impregnate Cecile in order to destroy Gercourt's new love and in return Valmont coerces de Merteuil into promising to let him in her bed at last.

In the process of performing his part of the wager Valmont encounters Marie (Nastassja Kinski), a married woman who will not succumb to Valmont's superficial advances, making her all the more attractive to Valmont.  And while Valmont is at the estate of his aunt Madame de Rosemonde (Danielle Darrieux), playing the game with Cecile and Marie, M. de Merteuil is feeding misinformation to a young violin student at her music academy Raphael Danceny (Tedi Papavrami), convincing him that his accompanist Cecile, though promised to Gercourt, has fallen in love with Danceny!  Cecile does indeed become pregnant, threatening her future, Valmont eventually seduces Marie with disastrous reults, and de Merteuil seduces Danceny to satisfy her pride.

How all of these threads are woven into a deeper and more complex interplay of morals, ethics, passion, and revenge is the tale that unravels slowly but tightly.  The ending is different from the novel: we are no longer in the days when duels could settle any matter of honor or pride. But this ending is equally as cruel and harsh as the original.

The interplay between Deneuve and Everett is something to behold - razor-sharp, vituperative, and scintillating.  One does wonder why the director selected a cast where three of the characters are basically English speaking, but those three perform so well that the question is without foundation.  The musical score by  Angelo Badalamenti is one of the finest on film and the cinematography by Caroline Champetier is sumptuous: the differences between her choices for light and shadow whether for interiors or exteriors shows a sensitive eye.

For this reviewer the author of the novel would probably applaud this updated version of this complex and fascinating story.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, April 05",1112572800,18,3800,5.069020866773676
1974006,4,B00015YV5Y,"An excellent adaptation of Laclos' LES LIASONS DANGEREUSES. Most screen adaptations of this novel are several degrees of horrible. The charm of the book, which is absolutely brilliant, is that it is structured by correspondence; it consists of letters between the characters. The literary thrusts in the book, therefore, are often far more delectable than the more literal thrusts between the characters. Thus, adaptation is extremely difficult.
In this film all of the plot points are followed, but with some noticeable changes. First, Gercourt is actually a character, where in the novel he is always significantly absent. Gercourt, however, was miscast. The fellow is just too old to make a credible fiance to a 19-year old girl in 1960s France. Second, obviously, the context is not eighteenth-century France, but an elegant Paris in the Sixties. The cars used in this production are absolutely stunning; they almost glow. Third, Deneuve is a wonderful actress, and her portrayal of Merteuil is far superior to Glenn Close, however she is too old. In the book she was in her late twenties, and a woman in her mid-thirties would have been more credible here.
Also, the writers fleshed out the ending quite a bit in very interesting and humanizing ways, where Laclos sort of just sort of killed everyone off with gusto. The inclusion of all of the characters, and the development of all of their interrelationships makes this a very long movie (270 minutes!). The movie is often visually stunning. Many of the sets absorb light in beautiful ways, radiating their darkness.
This film is infinitely superior to Close and Malkovich's botched DANGEROUS LIAISONS, which was just overblown, overacted ham, in my opinion. Valmont's descent into his crisis of indistinguishable sincerity/insincerity is wonderfully portrayed by Rupert Everett.
An interesting adaptation of the book, which will interest its fans. Those who are interested in the story, yet don't like to read, will find all of the entirety of the book represented, though adapted and interpreted quite differently.",1081814400,21,2074,5.231231231231231
1974007,1,B00015YV5Y,"First, Catherine Deneuve is too old for this role -- she's about 60! She looks great for her age, but it's hard to believe any of the men would be drawn to her or find her sexy. In fact, I couldn't see sparks between any of the characters. With such a noteworthy cast and scandalous plot, the lackluster acting was disappointing, as well as the missing sensuality and excitement. I saw this broadcast on cable and it was dubbed in English, but the film stock went back and forth so you could read the actors' lips to see when they were speaking English or French -- and the change in audio quality was noticeable. I admittedly could stomach only half the movie and would've rated it zero stars. Watch the adaptation starring John Malkovitch and Glenn Close instead, or another great version, ""Valmont,"" which stars Colin Firth.
  The basic plot line for these movies, for those who don't know, is: Marquise de Merteuil is a respected member of high society but very promiscuous, and Vicomte de Valmont is equally promiscuous and enjoys ruining the reputations of his lovers. They're good friends, of like mind, and scheme against others in France together. The pair plans Valmont's next conquests to be a virtuous married woman and a young girl.

8006995,1,B00015YV5Y,"I was eager to see one of my favorite actresses is an adaptation of one of my all-time favorite novels, but was appalled by the low-quality of the horrifically dubbed DVD. And even though Miss Deneuve dubs her own English dialogue, her English enunciation is so poor, many of her lines are unintelligible. Obviously this was a multi-national production in the style of the old Serge Leone westerns, but at least they addressed the fact and made sure that the films were clearly dubbed for their respective national audiences. The producers of this film should have spent the extra dime to have it subtitled. After thirty minutes of back-tracking the DVD trying to decipher what was being said, I finally gave up. Yes, if you don't mind missing a line here and there, you can follow the story. But my suggestion would be to read the novel!",1405900800,,838,4.707482993197279

8006997,1,B00015YV5Y,I purchased movie from Steelhead Enterprises and did not realize I was missing so much of the movie until the credits appeared (SURPRISINGLY enough).  I discovered that I had received ONLY disc 2 - missing discs 1 and 3 - only 85 minutes viewed -- EXTREMELY disappointed!!!!,1336089600,,274,4.829787234042553
8006998,5,B00015YV5Y,"First and foremost, this movie is beautifully filmed. The art director obviously had a ball with the sets, clothing, and other period details. He or She put a lot more care and detail into every scene than I would have expected, and it's a delight to watch. I find myself peeking into every nook and corner-. And the cars! Even if this movie was terrible in every way, it would be worth watching (or skimming) just to see the 1960's Rolls Royce, Maserati, Bentley and other gorgeous vintage European cars. Divine music: Motown, blues and a bit of rock and roll. This movie intentionally moves at a slow, even pace, and the richness of the period details help keep the mind and eye occupied. I'm not exaggerating by much when I say that this movie could be viewed with the sound off. It's like looking at a high-end fashion catalog from the early and mid-1960's - if you like that sort of thing (which I do).

Secondly, I think it's important to keep in mind that that this book was not originally written as either a morality tale or critique of ancien regime aristocrats. The fact that it's interpreted that way speaks only of our contemporary sensibilities. Valmont's death is pointless, and Merteuil loses nothing except her position within the demi-monde. Like Versailles the characters in this movie exist in an amoral plane. Common notions of morality simply do not apply to these aristocrats. The very rich (like the very poor), have nothing to lose.

Third, this is a very funny movie if viewed with a certain amount of irony. I'm glad this version doesn't psychoanalyze the characters - Everyone is exactly what they seem to be. If the characters were complex and 3 dimensional, watching the slow sadistic manipulation, seduction and disposal of other lifelike characters would be unendurably painful. As it is, it's comical. I can only smile and laugh at their breathtaking cruelty. One of my favorite scene is when Valmont's aunt Rosamonde tells him that Tourvel has left because he is making her suffer so. Biting his thumb and with a look of sheer demonic glee he asks ""Is she really suffering?"" Very very funny. But only because he is, existentially, a predator and nothing else. The director studiously avoids delving beneath the surface of these characters. True to the source material, (and life at Versailles) appearance is the only reality.

This movie is beautiful to look at, and it's a lot of fun to watch the audacity with which these cold, emotionally bleached aristocrats ruin others and themselves for no good reason (other than sheer boredom).",1278720000,4,2570,4.8231292517006805
8006999,5,B00015YV5Y,"Enjoyed immensely.  Had seen the versions with Glenn Close, Jean Morreau and Annette Bening, as well as the opera composed by Conrad Suza and performed at the San Francisco Opera with Frederica von Stade.  It is interesting how well all versions were adapted to the original.  I even saw the play in London and recently in New York.  I feel the lead roles are truly villainous.....and I love seeing revenge take its course when the bad person gets it in the end.  This plot is great fun.  I feign from seeing the US teen versions Cruel Intentions which number three movies, but I may give in someday and watch them.",1217721600,,615,4.545454545454546

Son rle est semblable  celui qu'elle jouait dans ""Belle de Jour"" il y a 30 ans.  Voil pourquoi il est tellement dommage que l'histoire originale par Laclos ne se soit pas acheve.

8007001,5,B00015YV5Y,"The good thing about this 2003 version  is that I kept thinking it was ""very current,"" but it is set in the 1960s.  I mean to say that the evil theme and accompanying drama are ageless.  The version by Glen Close and John Malkovitch is the standard to me.  However, the Catherine Deneuve and Rupert Everett version shines uniquely in its own way.  Thus, both versions are exquisite interpretations of a notorious story.  This review is about the Short Version in English, not the long version in French.

I have read some reviews here and there on this version that say that Deneuve is not believable as a sex object.  My response is that she could be if she was ever a sex object to you.  For instance, when she acted in Belle de Jour, or when she was the face for Chanel Couture in the 80s.  Thus, the vestige of that profound beauty is preserved in her slightly bloated body and weary face.  To me, real beauty is that kind that ages, yet maintains some of the original vitality and aura of its former self.  Catherine does this. Moreover, this production emphasizes how lust is absolutely enhanced by wealth, luxury, and power.  It is then credible why teenage boys may want to have an affair with a woman old enough to be their mother.  That phenomenon can be compared to drinking a 50-year-old cabernet or merlot.  What wine connoisseur could resist????  Either sex, when precocious, appreciates instruction from a master.  Valmont desires Madame de Merteuil because she is no longer accessible, because she is a master seductress, and not because she is sexy (although the average heterosexual male will find her sexy).  She was a very rich, very powerful woman in Haute Parisienne society, which is comparable to heroin to some.  Predators thrive on conquests.

Deneuve  is splendid in her Gaultier costumes and, to me, she ages much better than did Grace Kelly/ Princess Grace.

There was a very aggravating flaw in the technical aspect of this version (the 200 minute English), as Catherine's dubbed dialogue always seemed to be one or two syllables off.  I chose to ignore this.

Also, for the very bad human behavior, or Valmonts and de Merteuil's dangerous liaison, to be based on Madame de Merteuil's bitter jealousy makes perfect sense to me.  First, Valmont and Merteuil are already ""ruined"" spiritually having been using people as pawns for a long time, and themselves being used, so there were no moral scruples that could have been expected of them anyway.  In reality,  evil for the sake of evil is perfect balance to good for the sake of good.  You cannot have good without almost an equal amount of evil.  C'est La Vie.

Note:  An important distinction between the Glen Close and Deneuve versions is that Rupert's Valmont acts out his revenge against Madame de Merteuil in greater detail than did Malkovitch's Valmont.  Rupert systematically moves among the other characters in an attempt to redeem himself particularly for the damage done to innocent Marie Tourvel (Nastassja Kinski), whom he fell in love with unexpectedly (by fate) and foolishly destroyed by caprice.

Valmont/Rupert feels that death is a form of release from the torment of remorse and says:  "" . . .  to bring about your ruin (i.e. Madame de Merteuil) has brought me no consolation.  My proposal to be your friend or your foe was also meaningless, each individual is first a victim of himself.""

If you can believe in Divine Retribution, then we can see intervention from God, who caused Valmont to fall in love with one of his victims during, perhaps, the most dangerous game he has ever played.  So, ideally, he can never have the love that he would desire, because love is not a virtue suited for the wicked.  I perceive it will be the most impossibly desired ""concept"" in hell by the damned, where longing will exceed the agony of fire.  Christians know that Jesus values love, joy, peace, virtue, etc. greater than diamonds and gold.  These are his treasure, and are jealously guarded.  Christ allows lust (fake love) to proliferate among the wicked, but NEVER love.

I don't think I will ever be able or even want to seriously criticize any version of LES LIAISONS DANGEREUSES, as this story is a masterpiece that defines how we can sometimes get into a relationship easily that turns out to be impossible to exit without unseen personal damage or destruction.",1154390400,14,4360,4.78045515394913
