Not a good job of being positive and what a wonderful earth we live on or anything. It was just all negative, and that there is no answer.  It just made me hate vegans even more.  Half of the facts were said by a nutjob family doctor who has no specialization in any of the areas he is talking about (other than having some letters behind his name).

One good thing.....hmm....i learned a little about agriculture engineering.",1375315200,,588,4.327272727272727
8292507,4,B001DAVUNC,"This 45 min. DVD tells the story of what is wrong with our current agricultural system.  It has a lot of the same information that you can find out there and serious environmentalists and foodies may already know about it.  But a lot of people don't.  The topic is important and I wish everyone would become aware of the problems of industrial agriculture.

I only gave it 4 stars because they spent way too much time trying to convince the viewer of their solution - we all need to become vegans, which I believe is incorrect.  There is another alternative - sustainable, grass/pasture based, humane animal production.  Unfortunately, the film was shot mostly in California and I doubt there was much pasture there so the filmmaker may not have seen that as an option.

There are some slaughter scenes - they are short and somewhat tasteful but I wish they had had a specified end so sensitive people could leave for that portion and then return but there is one more scene of a dying cow at the very end as well.",1232496000,6,1014,4.538461538461538
