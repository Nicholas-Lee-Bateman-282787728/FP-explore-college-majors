8442994,5,B004V706BQ,"It is a direct import from Japan, there is no blu ray releases in the US, so this is the only way to get it.

UPDATE: Didn't realize it is ""Vol 1"" of six LOL. So for a Blu Ray straight from Japan under strict blu ray copyright ""red tape"" you will be paying top dollar per episode (each set contains 2 episodes; run-time ~50 min)

Comes with and embriodered cardboard stand for the artwork (2 mini ""photos"") a mini manga and OST 1. ""Deadman Wonderland"" is printed on a transparent plastic slip on cover. It's all in japanese too.

The packaging is the most subtle and elegant I've ever seen. It's just gorgeous.

The Blu Ray quality is good too.

I would recommend buying it if any of these apply:
1. You can understand japanese
2. You want the hard to find OST or
3. You want something on your DVD self that is simply beautiful and have $.

(5 stars because I cant rate lower for my own negligence. Dont mind being reminded of how much I spent when I see this on the shelf)",1366156800,9,973,4.176470588235294
