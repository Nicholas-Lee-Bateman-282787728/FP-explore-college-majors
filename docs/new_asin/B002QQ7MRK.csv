8377861,4,B002QQ7MRK,A very well done documentary. The British have research dollars and the Russians have some of the best deep sea equipment. A good match to get some science done.,1414368000,,161,4.586206896551724
8377862,5,B002QQ7MRK,"Insightful and personal view of British and Russian scientists aboard a ship in the Mid-Atlantic searching for hydro-thermal vents, known as 'Black Smokers'. Leo, a Russian scientist leads the expedition in his very humanized and charismatic approach. Though language problems and Russian cuisine posed some differences for the British and Russian scientists, Leo brings the team together and leads them to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean in search of what might bring them to the origins of life on earth.

Extraordinary underwater footage of the sea bed floor, where the team's submarine is launched two miles down in search of the 'Black Smokers'.

You come to know and love the personalities of the people aboard this ship, and feel as if you know them personally, especially Leo, the Russian leader. You witness how people from two distinct countries start out with a skeptical attitude toward one another, and end up as great friends and respected colleagues.

A wonderful, absolutely fascinating program about a subject matter people know very little about - 'Black Smokers', and their possible connection to the origin of life here on earth. You have to view this program. Leo is extremely entertaining, and the subject matter insightful and interesting. It's definitely worth the watch.... You won't be disappointed!",1377820800,2,1326,5.245283018867925
