3958088,4,B002N7HXJ4,"Christian suffers the worst fate that any father could possibly imagine when the police inform him that his daughter has been found suffocated to death after being physically abused and pumped full of drugs. After receiving an anonymous package in the mail, Christian learns that his daughter had fallen into an underground pornography ring, and he immediately sets off to find his daughter's killers and make them pay! Steven Kastrissios' breakthrough Independent feature THE HORSEMAN is an abrasive thriller that follows one man's violent and bloody quest for revenge. Unlike so many other antiheroes, Christian is neither sly, stealthy, or self-assured. He frequently loses his composure and breaks down into quivering fits of rage, madness, and sorrow as he interrogates each of the men that he feels are responsible for his daughter's death. Peter Marshall is intimidating in the role, with a fiery intensity that explodes on screen. The young hitchhiker, Alice, that he picks up on the road serves as the only remaining link to his humanity, a surrogate daughter for him to protect in place of his own. Although the action beats can become repetitive as Christian uses the same methods of torture to extract information from his victims, the raw violence and gritty gore are painfully realistic. Kastrissios constantly forces the audience to question the morality behind Christian's vigilante justice, especially when each of the men involved in the sex tape claim that his daughter was already on drugs when she arrived and that she was a willing participant at all times. Blinded by rage, Christian willfully ignores the fact that his daughter may have been responsible for her own asphyxiation. With its tightly drawn tension and suspense, THE HORSEMAN stands out as one of the strongest action films to come out of Australia since the original MAD MAX!

3958089,2,B002N7HXJ4,"I bought this film excited on a friend's recommendation and the review on here, as I am always game for a good revenge film. This movie in my opinion fails in not making me sympathetic to the protagonist dad.  He wasn't a true badass expect when he turned into killing mode, but other aspects he was just whining too much. I left the film not carrying if he got his revenge and at times wishing someone would just end him. Which isn't good, aren't I suppose to be rooting for him?",1286064000,2,480,4.274725274725275
3958090,4,B002N7HXJ4,"The revenge film is a genre that is heavily populated, and yet few of its members ever really transcend to greatness. For every great revenge film (""Last House on the Left"", ""Kill Bill"") there are at least ten that are silly, schlocky, or exploitive.

""The Horseman"" doesn't aim to reinvent the revenge film drama, but elevate it. The very simple plot involves a father's quest to punish the men involved with a porn shoot that his troubled daughter was involved in, which either directly or indirectly led to her death. The father (Christian) visits each member of the seedy network of porn purveyors, ruthlessly determined to use any means necessary (violence, torture, threats) to find out who was directly involved, and punish them.

Peter Marshall gives a tour-de-force performance as Christian (the father) that makes the film succeed. When confronting the men who he believes were responsible for his daughter's death, he is merciless, mechanical, and unapologetically violent. But the actor's eyes reveal the character's truth - that Christian is a man in so much pain, that numbness and violence are his only choices. It's clear that Christian's anger, hatred, and thirst for vengeance are also his punishment to himself for failing his daughter as a father and protector. Underneath the gritty violence, Marshall shows the character's broken heart.

Although the bloody, ugly, violent business of revenge make up most of the film, a subplot where Christian befriends a troubled runaway add to Christian's humanity. And when his plot for revenge endangers the girl in the film's final act, it gives Christian's violent quest an urgency and opportunity for redemption.

Bravo.",1283299200,42,1684,5.202952029520295

3958092,5,B002N7HXJ4,"Intense! like the previous review said, you have seen this plot before (more recently in the Taken move with Liam Neeson) but you have NEVER seen any revenge plot produced with such intensity.
 Every minute is pretty much gripping and heart wrenching and honest. Our main character isn't a Kung Fu, special ops, commando type guy but just your average Joe who is at first emotionally numb towards his daughter's recent death. As the movie goes on his anger and rage grows and eventually he gets revenge not with choreographed action sequences and Hollywood special effects but with an honest and graphic caveman-like violence. If anything the violence inflicted is very human and honest and up close. It connects you with the hero because in most scenes he is fighting not just for revenge but for his own life as he gets mixed up with the wrong people connected to the original people he is seeking. This is where the movie earns every star.
Very good stuff. Like I said it reminded me of Taken and even the hero father guy looks a lot and sounds a lot like Liam Neeson.
Actually I wouldn't at all be surprised to find out that Taken is a big blown up American Hollywood remake of this much better, tighter, and more gripping movie.",1282348800,97,1233,4.6045454545454545
3958093,3,B002N7HXJ4,"Wow! This is one of the darkest, most violent films seen to date. The story was nothing new: Father goes after the killers of his daughter, who happens to be a junkie and gang raped for a snuff film. It shows things I prefer left to the imagination. He becomes a killing machine (evidently if a child dies, you just become a bad a@@), who picks up a girl(who, coincidently happens to be a junkie). Although, nothing happens in the film; the implications makes your skin crawl. I am quite certain they were going for the martyr savior thang; but, it had the opposite effect. It reminded me a little of The Professional, with a body count that is all face to face. I reccomend The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo; still dark, but with a plot that seems plausible. It also does not make you want to take a shower afterwards.  The Horseman is a very dark film.",1278720000,17,852,4.3584905660377355
3958094,4,B002N7HXJ4,"This is maybe the most violent film I've ever seen.  It's very well done, and I applaud that fact, but it's really just a kind of pornography.  You know how in sexual porn
movies it often starts off with just a simple sexual act, the gradually adds more people and toys to the act?  That is, first, the missionary position, then some variations
on that, then let's bring in the French maid, and then the kids' riding pony.  Well, this is the same kind of thing--the violence goes from simple beat-a-guy-to-death-with-
a-crowbar to let's put fishhooks into his penis and pull real hard, to let-spoon out his eyes with a special eye-spooning instrument.

And yet it's well-done.  I am not particularly sensitive to made-up violence onscreen, but this director (also writer and producer) did it with such cleverness and style that
I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.

I can't bring myself to give even a well done piece of violence porn five stars, and yet I can't lie and pretend the guy didn't do a really good job.  It is what it is.
If you like hard-porn violence, you will absolutely love this.",1277251200,6,1118,4.582914572864322
3958095,5,B002N7HXJ4,"I admit the first time I watched this I thought it was simply ok...I usually have to watch a film twice so that the second time I watch it I watch it for what it is and not what I expected it to be...
The Horseman takes on a different approach to the Revenge films. He is not Special OPS and has no special type of training but is simply a Father...Who is pissed! The story takes place after his Daughter is murdered and he now must make them pay. It kind of had a Man on Fire feel but at the same time felt original.**SPOILERS** I like the revenge films such as Man on Fire, Law Abiding Citizen (aside from the ending) and Taken. This film felt more raw. Tearing off a guys ear, bike pump inserted in the...Yeah. Raw. I also liked that he was just an ordinary guy driven by revenge and grief. This film goes to show you don't need a huge budget to make a great film.",1276905600,6,867,4.046511627906977
3958096,5,B002N7HXJ4,"The Horseman absolutely blew me away I'm ordering it as I write this.
I caught it on Fios On Demand.
After his daughter ends up dead The girl in questions father finds out she was involved in a porno shoot  where she was drugged and abused on set. What ensues next is one of the best revenge films I have ever seen.

It is shot somewhat out of sequence,basically after he(Peter Marshall) gives a ride to a stranded girl near the same age as his deceased daughter ,she asks if he has any children. This takes him back to the beginning in a flashback and from there it goes from flashback to real time.

It is brutal,bloody with teeth grinding ,edge of your seat suspense and action.
I don't see it as a horror movie but a riveting bloody thriller.
It starts off full speed ahead and never lets up. There was not one moment that I wasn't glued to the TV.Peter Marshall is incredibly believable ,powerful and brilliant as Christian the vengeful father on a mission.

Since the death of his daughter he is reduced to a cutter,with the camera getting shots of him cutting on his arm and hands frequently which makes any pain he may receive along the way not as effective to him as it would someone that does not inflict intentional pain on themselves.

I say buy it,you will definitely want to watch it more than once ,as well as have it in your collection. The last 20 minutes were some of the most tense moments I have ever seen on film. There's some Irony in the ending that is quite genius and effective. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would..",1276560000,62,1550,4.3310344827586205

Heaps of great reviews of it online and I wasn't disappointed.

It's damn violent, but it's smart, not schlock.
And I was surprised by how affecting it is.
Great acting by the whole cast, especially Peter Marshall.
The action is really unique too.
A simple little tale, but done with a detailed eye and subtle writing.
I must admit I got a LOT more out of it the 2nd time I watched it too.

3958223,1,B002N7HXJ4,"For those who like action isolated from any character development, you will enjoy this movie. It follows the main character as he consecutively eliminates one bad guy after another. Where the movie falls short is in developing each and every character and their relationships with each other.  It is basically the main character's journey to systematically find and kill the bad guy then move on and repeat the process over and over. Character development is lacking. Relationships are missing. This movie left me asking the question: ""Where's the beef?"".

3958487,4,B002N7HXJ4,"Hollywood movie rubbish like Taken stylize violence and make sure there's never any realism that might disturb the popcorn-eating audience. This Australian movie, by contrast, is all about gritty realism. When a father discovers that his daughter was drugged up and used in a porno movie and then left to choke on her heroin-induced vomit he decides to take revenge on the men who were responsible. What follows is a fairly traditional tale of mayhem but with the crucial difference that everything is realistic. Unlike Hollywood nonsense, we aren't required to identify with the protagonist uncritically. Indeed, we may feel at times uncomfortable with his behavior - and this makes him more human, and the movie more true to life. The fight sequences are also realistic and don't rely on absurd moments of good luck or stupid Hollywood tropes like bullets magically swerving around the good guy but miraculously always hitting the bad guys. When someone gets clunked with a length of pipe it does real damage. The protagonist makes mistakes that have consequences. This is in many ways an uncomfortable movie and rightly so. Hollywood violence-porn is all about pretending violence isn't gritty and damaging; this movie in contrast is all about showing just how unpleasant violence (regardless of its cause) really is. Therefore if your idea of entertainment is a Stallone/Schwartzenegger/Generic-Action-Hero fantasy you should avoid this movie and browse the children's section instead. Conversely if you are curious about what it might really be like for a father to seek revenge on those who abused his daughter, and you can stomach the brutality, this movie is definitely worth watching.",1430524800,,1693,5.250922509225092

However, there has always, in my experience, been a tendency in Australian movies to explore violence in a in a kind of in-your-face way that makes me react to American movie violence (with some exception, particularly with war movies like Saving Private Ryan and, more recently Fury) at a somewhat slight remove. In addition, Australian movie violence has a rather creepy quality to it as well. The Horseman is just about the most perfect example of this I can think of. I'm trying to remember whether I even breathed once during the entire movie. Definitely not for the faint-of-heart and even aficionados of movie violence will probably walk away from The Horseman breathless and disturbed. This one makes the Charles Bronson Death Wish series of movies seem almost like comedies in comparison. Pulls no punches whatsoever. Just don't blame me if you turn this off halfway through.

Not only is it exceptionally violent, but the violence is unusual and cruel (the fish hooks in the testicles scene is particularly toe-curling). Though it was obviously made on a budget, the film is shot very well and the acting is surprisingly pretty good. The plot is disappointingly simple, but I think that's sort of the point because the main character is a simple, straight-forward kind of man seeking revenge on the men who raped and murdered his daughter. The film tries hard to work in a redemptive aspect to the man's pain by mixing in a fatherly relationship he begins with a troubled teenage girl, but it seems forced and predictable.

Angry that she put herself in that position and knowing that she valued the drugs more than herself.

I have not seen any other action/revenge movie that swept me along the way this one did - but make no mistake it is a rough ride emotionally because the protagonist is so much the ordinary guy forcing himself to do such extreme things that you (for a change) can readily identify yourself with what he's going through.

My dad called the cops and afterwards, he saw the korean girl openly sitting with her tormentors afterwards as if there was no punishment and no law and they told her she belonged to them.

so no we are not concerned with collaborators have to say in discouragement of justice and in praise of the upstanding citizenship of the perpetrators - your opinion does not matter.

Everyone is connected, everyone is responsible - it's a long story but the energy to tell it is there.  They're not ashamed of what they do, not ashamed of being exposed, of having the father standing in front of them so they won't mind if the whole world knows everything about them because they believe they are socially accepted and there is no problem for their children and grandchildren and so forth to be associated with this nothing to be ashamed of behavior.

And if you don't finish every last one of them off, you will be sorry as if you did not actually comprehend why you had to finish them off.

If all the surviving grievers of the victims were dead, then the bad guys would be without worry so we have to be grateful for the concept of law enforcement where every victimization is pursued as if it is personal.

The violence in this film is necessary for it to be realistic, unachievable without all the blood and gores.

3959039,4,B002N7HXJ4,"Overview:
Definitely a disturbing Revenge flick.
I think of the formula of this movie as this:
2 parts ""8mm"" (With John Cusack)
1 part ""Hostel"" (For the graphic violence)
1 part ""Taken"" (or similar Liam Neeson film).

So while my comparisons aren't exactly bright, or even oscar winning, and the movie is exceptionally disturbing, it was better than most. Something about Australian film-makers I've noticed, they're all good at dark and disturbing. Overall, good film. I little cheesy in the dialog, but it works for all the screwed up people that comprise the cast. There aren't any ""polished debutants"" in the film, and they're all a little socially detached anyway.",1398902400,,669,5.081818181818182

I still feel the plot moves a bit slow at times in between the fight scenes, but if you are not watching it only for the fight scenes the plot actually makes sense.

(* SPOILER ALERT *)

3959072,4,B002N7HXJ4,"I have to admit I added this to my watchlist with some trepidation. I'm not interested in slasher flicks. I do like well-drawn characters and dramas that have coherent psychological underpinnings. The Horseman is dark, and why wouldn't it be? This is a well-done addition to the revenge/vigilante genre. Two films that come to mind that are similarly well-done are the original Get Carter and Harry Brown, both with the great Sir Michael Caine. As Quentin Tarantino once said about revenge stories, they're not complicated. The main character is looking for an accounting of wrongs. Simple. The violence is not gratuitous, but it is brutal at times. In fact, there is remarkable restraint in what is shown. Mainly, the violence is shown to depict what's necessary to advance the story, but also to let you know that what Christian is doing is flat brutal. What sets this film apart from a lesser film in this genre is that both through a beautifully understated performance and flashbacks to earlier, happier times, Peter Marshall exudes this aching, hopeless sense of loss. He is a man with nothing left to lose, but he's not always purposefully driven by rage, either. He alternates between wanting to do himself in and wanting to take it out on anyone even tangentially involved in the drug-induced death of his only child. The hitchhiker in the story is important because she represents what he has lost, but also that last chance at rescue and redemption. Other reviewers have criticized the film for being unrealistic about a regular guy becoming a ""badass"" simply through loss and a desire for revenge. I disagree--out of the hundreds of films I've seen with fight scenes, this one is actually one of the best because they are gritty and real--and amateur. Christian nearly gets killed several times, because he's no fighter. He's not a professional killer. The fight scenes reflect someone fighting for his life, despite not quite having a life beyond the moment at hand. There are a few twists that were well-played and well-written. If you like revenge flicks, this one will be satisfying, no doubt.

This gritty Australian film is without the production value we expect from Hollywood films.  But in this case it adds a realism and brutality.  Watching this is not for the faint of heart.  But for the person who can imagine becoming a monster to punish those that killed your daughter there will be painful reflections here.

I'm usually conflicted about the antihero in killing spree, revenge movies but not here.  Here the prey are so loathsome even theirs wives want them dead.

My dark-side wants to give it a cringy 5 but the forensic movie goer wants to give it a streaming adjusted (there's just so much garbage) 3.  Average it to 4 that many people will hate.

3959148,4,B002N7HXJ4,"The qualities that make up a ""good movie"" are very subjective, I realize, but I think The Horseman is above par.

The subject matter is good.  Its easy to empathize with a man who loses his daughter at the hands of a bunch of perverts and creeps, and who wants to punish them for what they did.  I felt the movie flowed along quite well, keeping me entertained and interested throughout.  The actors did their job and seamlessly blended out of sight, replaced by the characters they were portraying.  The violence may turn off some viewers, but it isn't gratuitous violence, since its understandable given the story.  A well done gritty and bloody tale about a father who is shattered by his daughter's death and reacts in the only way he can think of - to go after anyone related to what happened to her.",1363392000,,805,4.517241379310345

Christian works for a pest control company (or he has his own pest control company, not clear but irrelevant). Now when I say pest control you are thinking cockroaches, mice rats etc. This movie is about eliminating the scum that killed his daughter.  He is eliminating the cockroaches and the rats that belong to a clandestine porn operation who are responsible for his daughter's death. He is not a martial art expert, he is only a working class father, not a professional killer.  He is fighting like everybody else. The fight scenes are like street fight scenes. Christian shows up at everybody's door with his equipment and eliminates them one by one. On his way to one of the houses he picks up a girl that wants to escape her current environment. While the movie winds down slowly and we think is over, the last mean guy will escape, they suddenly get stopped by a cop, and the movie starts all over again, more intense than before. Everything happens in Australia and we are in for a surprising ending.

This is a very intense and well done film. It is very violent and very graphic. You will not see the time go by. The acting is decent, but the accent is sometimes difficult to follow. Five stars.",1355961600,2,1247,4.553571428571429

3959153,4,B002N7HXJ4,"Like other reviewers, I had no idea what to expect from this Australian production, but I did assume that it would follow the routine course of the countless revenge tales that preceded it. Boy, was I wrong. Not since watching The Exorcist many years ago have I been so unprepared for a movie. In fact, comparing it to any previous revenge flick is like comparing Gone With the Wind to a Looney Tunes Cartoon....it is absolutely riveting, thoroughly engaging, well-scripted, superbly acted, and not easily forgotten.

The storyline is simple and already described by many other reviewers; it involves a physically unimposing father avenging the death of his teenage daughter at the hands of porn merchants, or so he assumes. What separates this production from previous ones is that it explores the gray area of responsibility for her death, between the father who tortures himself (legitimately) for his poor parenting, the girl herself for making bad decisions, and the group of men involved in her demise. Most of these men present their side of the issue, and it should be noted that some of them present rather compelling cases. They are not all the drooling, psychotic fiends normally encountered in such productions, but characters which are generally complex, realistic, and guilty to varying degrees.

The father has no superhuman abilities and is always in great jeopardy while exacting his revenge. You are never really sure if he's going to achieve his goal or end up sharing his daughter's fate. This adds greatly to the suspense. He is not Liam Neeson or Charles Bronson, but just a common guy whose guilt makes him relatively immune to pain and whose rage makes him very, very tough. The fight scenes are superbly choreographed, and appear to be both spontaneous and absolutely realistic....the best I have ever seen. There is no silly Kung Fu or predictable outcome, just the sheer, scary violence that occurs in battles to the death. At no time does the violence become gratuitous, except perhaps during a torture scene involving pliers and a blowtorch (you will know it when you see it), which is quite rare in such movies.

The bottom line is that this is a spectacularly original, superbly staged and acted production which no ADULT action-movie fan should miss. There are no boring, trite, or predictable moments. It is absolutely electrifying, and, like someone who has just been Tasered, I can't fully describe the experience......you'll just have to find out for yourself.",1323388800,8,2496,5.024154589371981
3959154,1,B002N7HXJ4,"Trust me, I wanted this movie to be good.  I love hard-boiled revenge movies like ""Get Carter"" (the original) and ""Rolling Thunder"" so I was hoping this movie would be awesome and badass like those great movies.  Unfortunately, it is SO POORLY made it's nearly unwatchable.  The production values are the WORST.  It looks like it was made by a couple of high school kids using their parents' super cheap video camera.  The movie is grainy and every scene is cast in an ugly greenish tint.  The cinematography is atrociously bad.  Too many close ups, bad angles and weird ""choppy-motion"" shots that are popular these days with digital filmmakers but look stupid and horrible in action scenes (though the filmmakers probably think they're being ""arty"" and ""cool"").  They're not.  The story (what there is of one) is just a series of torture, interrogation and fight scenes as the father of a junkie daughter (who was in a porn film) goes around and finds the makers of the porn film and tortures, interrogates, fights and/or kills them.  Basically it's a rip-off of the much better 70's film ""Hardcore"" starring George C. Scott.  So if you're in the mood for a revenge flick, track down ""Hardcore"" or, better yet, ""Rolling Thunder"" starring William Devane.  Just stay far, far way from ""The Horseman.""  It's total garbage.",1314144000,3,1320,4.865470852017937

I'm far from being a fan of the shaky-hand-held-camera school of videography. 98% of which is pointless and worth little, adding virtually nothing to or for the film; just another ""effect"" that once played out, is discarded like so many other of the ever-changing mores of filmmakers. I can't wait until 3-D peters out and filmmakers go back to working on stories and not sf/x.

However, there is the remaining two-percent. Those few movies where a steady-cam and blocked scenes interferes with and diminishes the story being told. This is one of those stunning and savage films.

Uglier, grittier and viscerally honest - there were more than a few scenes where turning away is almost required. One in particular will make your manhood shrink in fear.

I won't say anymore. If the purest form of revenge and the darkest side of destructive appeasement rendered unto film is your cup of tea - then this is your film.",1313107200,2,1830,6.0
3959156,2,B002N7HXJ4,"Judging by the other reviews here, I thought this movie would be good... or at least watchable.

The acting isn't bad at all, but that's really the only bright spot.  The storyline doesn't make much sense.  The protagonist isn't particularly smart or skilled, so it doesn't make much sense how he continually is able to get the drop on the bad guys, and as messy as he is it makes zero sense how he continues to not get caught by the police.

This movie is NOTHING like Taken, by the way, which is a far superior plotted movie.  I wasn't expecting big budget effects or anything, I just really had a hard time finding the plot to be believable.

For most of the movie, I did not see the protagonist as the good guy at all, and actively was more on the side of the 'bad guys'.  Why?  Because unlike in Taken, or similar movies, the 'bad guys' didn't actually kill/kidnap/torture/murder the guy's daughter at all.  She voluntarily engaged in a homemade porn movie and then afterwards died of a drug overdose.  Not a snuff movie or even a bondage movie, just casual badly shot group sex porn with 3 or 4 guys (also, I doubt very seriously that a movie like that would sell or be appealing enough to package into a videocassette that would be for sale).

Yet the girl's father, after learning about the porno, goes into a rage (which I can somewhat understand) and decides to kill (and in some cases torture before killing) everyone who might have been involved in the porn shoot.

I'm not claiming that the guys who were involved in making the porn were good people, actually they seem kind of like dirtbags.  But they weren't serial killers or murderers, just regular scumbags, and I had a really hard time believing they deserved to die just for being the type of douchebags who would engage in group sex on a poorly-filmed porn.  I especially felt bad when the protagonist tortures one guy and then while he's tied up murders his brother in front of him, and then kills him next after the 1st guy is emotionally broken from watching his little brother die.  These were not nice guys, but they didn't seem like evil bastards who deserved to die in such a way.

Now, later in the final set piece, it is revealed that one of the guys who organized the porno shoot actually is one of those totally sick/evil/murdering evil bastard types who deserves to die (I guess in a way of revising history to make the father seem more justified in killing the other guys who were a whole lot less likely to deserve death) but by that point I have barely any sympathy for the father.  It is revealed that the guy who was in charge of the porno very likely drugged the daughter out of her mind, so she didn't entirely voluntarily participate in the porn (though it's not clear that any of the other guys would know this) and also may have given her more drugs when (she asked for them) so that he facilitate her overdose (even knowing that he's an evil murdering bastard who deserves to die, it's hard to say he's 100% responsible for the girl's overdose).

Anyway, the ending doesn't make up for the rest of the movie, and I was seriously disappointed in this (I don't know what movie the other reviewers were watching but it must have been different than the one I saw)",1312848000,,3254,4.458684654300169
3959157,3,B002N7HXJ4,"The reviewers who liked this movie seemed to focus on the immediacy and raw power of the events. Though I see that, the lesser aspects of the movie overshadowed any real power it could have delivered.

Here's the scoop. A young girl makes a porno movie with some guys she doesn't know. They give her some heroin to make her more amenable to the action. She is later found dead of an overdose. Dad goes out to exact revenge on everyone who had anything to do with the making of the film.

This movie fails at the outset. Dad is going to commit murder in his daughter's name for these unspeakable acts. I'm asking myself why she's doing this in the first place? She drinks, does drugs and makes porno movies. Where was he when she was being raised? Almost all his victims tell him (as they're experiencing grievous bodily harm) ""she came to us. We didn't force her into this."" As he does practice self mutilation we know he feels some degree of remorse, but evidently not much. And his helping the young, pregnant runaway girl is supposed to show him trying to make up for his bad parenting and it's a way too pat aspect of the script.

I found this all very brutish and clumsy. Tracking down those involved in the project was routine. There was nothing at all clever about it. The manner of killings was not clever either. Most of them he just beats to death. And the climax where they get the jump on him, and he has to try and turn the tables, is just plain lazy.

This is a revenge movie plain and simple, but the heart of it is questionable so the viewer isn't squarely on his side and that is necessary in a revenge movie. The acting is good enough and the production values are good enough. It clocks in at 95 minutes so it won't strain your time budget but I found this to be a very weak entry into the genre.",1310860800,,1815,4.282798833819242
