8568123,5,B00BGGITNM,"A psychiatrist (familiar plot) from Boston maneuvers the ins and outs of raising two lovely, determined teenage daughters, while his level-headed wife tries to keep her husband grounded.  The oldest daughter (Jill St. John) has gone abroad on a study/scholarship program to Argentina as she is an aspiring architect.  The youngest daughter finds romance along the way too with a military man.",1391904000,2,392,5.306451612903226
8568124,5,B00BGGITNM,"Love the Classics!  Although the ""main menu"" is very basic without any bells or whistles, the film itself shows beautifully.  It's a very nice addition to my DVD collection...",1389225600,,175,5.0
8568125,3,B00BGGITNM,"Well, at least this CinemaScope film is presented in Widescreen. This is a very mild, not very funny Clifton Webb vehicle. The travelogue aspect of South America is not that effective. Plus, the color of this print is often dark and not as vibrant as it should be. The cast is OK, especially Jane Wyman and Webb, as usual, plays Webb. Thin plot should have been funnier.",1367539200,2,370,4.537313432835821
8568126,3,B00BGGITNM,"When their eldest daughter (Jill St. John) travels to Brazil with a tour group and decides not to return, a psychologist (Clifton Webb), his wife (Jane Wyman) and their precocious younger daughter (Carol Lynley) trek down to South America to see what's going on. Based on the Broadway play by Ronald Alexander, the attractive cast can't do much with the sitcom material. It doesn't help that there's an unpleasant pre-feminist undertone to the proceedings. Webb wants his daughters to further their education but they're more concerned with boys/men and his wife seems to implicitly encourage them. One of the more hideous examples of the film's tone: when Lynley refuses to marry Gary Crosby, he takes her over his knee and spanks her! Webb is offended at this but Mama Wyman thinks it's cute! Yes, yes I know it was a different time but still. Furthermore although the film takes place in Brazil, it doesn't appear any of the cast went there, just the second unit as the actors play out their scenes in front of rear projections of Brazil's tourist sites. The film's theatrical poster compares it to THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN ... as if. Directed by Henry Levin (WHERE THE BOYS ARE). With Paul Henreid, Jose Greco, Nico Minardos, Wally Brown and Gardner McKay.

The Fox MOD DVDr is presented in an anamorphic wide screen (2.35) transfer which is a bit on the dark side but quite decent.",1365552000,5,1389,4.7875
8568127,5,B00BGGITNM,This is a very old classic. Clifton Webb is one of my favorite actors. I owned this movie on video and now on DVD. I happy that a lot of the old movies are becoming available to own.,1363046400,2,182,3.8157894736842106
8568128,5,B00BGGITNM,"Another wasted opportunity from 20th Century Fox if the AMAZON presis is to be believed:

""Presented in 1.77:1 ratio""

HOLIDAY FOR LOVERS is a sort-of THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN with lots of good ""travelog"" footage so surely we can reasonably expect a proper release to DVD.

Why haven't they yet realised we want these Scope films as they were produced and directed to be viewed - what are Flatscreen TV's for!!!

UPDATE: 14th JUNE, 2014 (SORRY for the long delay in doing so).

I took the kind advice of Paul SCOTT (of March, 2013) re my original notes, and some time back purchased the FOX DVD-R and indeed it is a beautiful 'Scope and Stereo-sound print of HOLIDAY FOR LOVERS.

So purchase a copy from AMAZON and enjoy a really good Travelogue-type story with great photography and location scenery, as well as a cast of regular favourites from the late Fifties.
