Although I am sick of watching it myself (lol) it has good morals in it that are a positive message for my son. It also provides good examples of how to behave or not behave. I would strongly recommend this for any child.",1364860800,,297,4.137931034482759
8257293,5,B00153ZQS2,"My son absolutley loves this cartoon & I was so delighted to find that it was a series! First we got him BFF (Best Frog Friend) and it was getting to the point that I could finish anyone's sentence in those episodes... it's getting that way with the new one two, but he doesn't seem to care! He smiles so big when he sees Will, Dewitt, and Will's parents enter a frame... I would suggest any new parent get one of the Will & Dewitt movies and see for yourself how your child reacts to them! The episodes have great lessons that will come in handy for preschooler years!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Will-Dewitt-My-BFF/dp/B00153ZQSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Will & Dewitt: My BFF</a>",1291852800,,730,5.301724137931035
8257294,5,B00153ZQS2,"Love this DVD, and so does my son!  It's filled with all the things a young school child can relate to; friendships, family, dillemas, and solutions.  Very thoughtful programming.  I only wish there were more DVDs in this series!",1262476800,,229,4.82051282051282
8257295,5,B00153ZQS2,"I bought this DVD because we've seen it on TV, and it's the same frog that's on our Kandoo soap and shampoos, etc.  I like this series because it is empowering, and preschoolers can really relate to the subject matter.  Very fast-paced, holds kids' attention and introduces good messages.  Plus it's 90 minutes long! Definitely recommend.",1219968000,,338,5.0
