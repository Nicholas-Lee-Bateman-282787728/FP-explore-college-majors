She said this was 'the real deal' . My husband and his brothers and sisters enjoyed it too. They really got a kick out of ""Who Stole the Kishka""!! They sing some songs in English, some in Polish. They sound like a group playing real Polish polkas at a wedding or a party. Very, very enjoyable.",1354924800,4,447,4.149425287356322
