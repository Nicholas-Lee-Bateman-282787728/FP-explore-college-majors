3423584,4,B00195FUEG,"i must be one of the few who actually thought this was a noble effort for first time director Eigeman. Nevermind that i think Famke is always beautiful, always watchable, but consider that take away the pool shark credo and this could be any desperate mother trying. It didn't win any oscars but it also didn't have that slick happy ending...thank Chris for that! I think what i appreciate most is that he doesn't paint Famke as desperate and the kid doesn't come off as clueless or naive. Worth a look.",1221004800,,503,4.538461538461538
3423585,3,B00195FUEG,"Great acting. Awesome pool shots. Depressing and disconnected storyline.
Illogical ending that punished the audience and the main character. Question: Why did the main character almost succeed with her plan to raise her son, only to be shot by a cop who was not threatened by her in any way? Hopeless  and disconcerting.

3423586,3,B00195FUEG,"I had never heard of this film before spotting the DVD cover on my local video rental establishment. There is was, Famke Janssen. Those expressive, wide open eyes, long black hair and drop dead gorgeous face staring at me as she stretched across the pool table. Needless to say that was more than enough encouragement to convince me that this would be a worthy rental.

Synopsis: The film I'm talking about is the '07 release `Turn the River', a tale of one wronged woman's struggle to reclaim her son from his abusive Father. In desperation she devises a plan to raise the needed cash via her impressive talent from playing cards and pool and escape with him across the U.S./Canadian border.

Critique: Famke is excellent in this film and displays more range and versatility than I had previously given her credit for, although in keeping with the role her natural beauty is never utilized. The cinematography was also a little too dark, many sequences taking place in a dimly lit pool hall, at night, or in a semi-light room. It was just a little too drab for my tastes. The ending was also a little too abrupt and disappointing. There's definitely no happy ending in this one.

Worth a watch, especially if you're a Famke Janssen fan.",1217635200,4,1237,4.691244239631336
3423587,1,B00195FUEG,"Don't waste your money.  This film wasn't developed enough (it's only 92 minutes, that's about the length of a children's cartoon movie), and so none of it makes any sense when it just---ends.  I've been scanning the Internet trying to figure out the ending.  Does she live? Does she die?  And what's with the final scene anyway????

Famke Janssen is a great actress, but her character never gets developed enough in order for you to decide what to think of her.  Compulsive gambler mother is better than alcoholic abusive husband?? Dunno.

Frankly, I didn't get it. I""m glad I saw it for free.",1217548800,3,594,4.70873786407767
3423588,4,B00195FUEG,"I probably have the same complaints as everyone who have seen this movie.  The storyline is choppy and not well developed.  The Janssen character seem strong willed and streetwise, so what was she doing with a dork like the father of her son and does she actually have a regular job? You can watch this movie from a Pool players angle but if that's the case, ESP coverage of Billiard Tournament is pretty exciting specially with Janette Lee and Villareal.  The pool games didn't create enough tension or suspense for me.  Jaymie Dornan who plays the son is a great character actor in the making and how interesting that casting actually picked a kid who resembles Janssen, which must have been difficult with her long pretty, angular features. This movie is gonna be Janssen's ticket to getting more dramatic roles that requires skills and the ability to convey complex emotions without saying too much which is what she acomplished in this movie.  Despite the Sequoia Tree stature, the sexy dark eyes and symetrical model face, Janssen is a very tense and a capable actor, that's why  I wouldn't totally chuck this movie because of some awkwardness in the developement of the storyline.  First time director, Chris Eigman is instinctual and impressive another reason why I reccommend this movie.  The DVD extras are nice too, there's a single shot of Janssen banking a ball as in ""turning the river"" she did it in one shot-wow! there's also a commentary with director and actress- which begs me to asked, why did Famke wear a hair piece/wig for the movie??",1217289600,,1557,4.805243445692884

  Rip Torn.
  Great character actors.
  It's all here with the exception of a decent denouement.
  Decent! Say rather proper.
  You don't titilate the audience with a good storyline and then pull out the rug. For no viable reason.
  The last minutes of this production are so silly and dumb that it borders on the ridiculous. If you listen to the Director Commentary it becomes even more mundane and foolish.
  A bad shot for cinematic entertainment.

3423590,2,B00195FUEG,"I was interested in seeing this since the film made the distributor posters like the mainstream movie artwork (listed as the number two title this week behind 21), plus it was given a must-see from the indie blurbs in the pre-booking literature.

Famke leads a first-time director and recognizable supporting cast in Rip Torn, Lois Smith and Terry Kinney in what is essentially a pool playing/gambling film. Rip plays a pool hall owner that helps a vice-laden mother (Famke) earn volumes of money through setting matches. Her estranged son since birth, played convincingly by Jaymie Dornan, writes letters to her and secretly meets with her in hopes of establishing any kind of relationship. In the course of their writings Famke determines that her son should be with her instead of his over-bearing father. She formulates a plan to hustle a large chunk of money and flee the Country with him.

The film is primarily about a mother-son relationship, but in a very strained way as no real back story is given. The film takes place in NYC, but that never seems to play a role either, so that leaves the biggest fans of this piece being the avid pool players. There are a variety of games and incredible shots played out, but the film is only held together by Famke's very convincing portrayal. That of a mom wanting to be with her son, yet creating a way to escape her unending circle of gambling to pay the bills.

Some of the complaints I hear are the slow pace, unfilled story lines, choppy text and ambiguous yet poorly played ending. The strengths have been the string music used throughout, Famke, and the awesome pool shots. Listening to the commentary was unrewarding as Famke talks very little, but the only other DVD special feature is worth the visit. It shows the 4-bank shot Famke makes in the film was a first take. All of the mistakes made in writing the film and actually shooting it (as the director lists them) are apparent and detract from what could have been a much better film.

Not one I would recommend for a competent story film, but definitely a nod for the pool players as some of the matches go on forever; provides for some great cue work.",1216944000,12,2167,4.650130548302872

3423645,1,B00195FUEG,"Turn The River is a stupid story, that is poorly directed, and just plain boring. Kailey is a professional gambler who not only lost custody of her son when she got divorced, but also lost the right to even see him. She is convinced that he ex-husband is abusing her twelve year old son, the way he abused her, and she's determined to do the only thing she can about. Kailey goes on a quest to win as much money as she can, so she can get her son and take him away to a better place. First of all, we have no idea why Kailey can't see her son and we so no evidence of abuse by her ex-husband. Gambling, also infers random games of chance, but not with Kailey, honestly it's just ridiculous. The film stars X-men beauty Famke Janssen, who is quite good looking, but unfortunately very dry as an actress. Her son, Law & Orders Jamyie Dornan, is a bit more entertaining, but the role is so badly written, that no one could have made it work. A lot of things are alleged and assumed in this movie, but we aren't shown any of it. It's impossible to separate fact from bull s***, in this incredibly slow dud of a movie. The script is terrible, the acting is bland, and the direction is sloppy. If you suffer from chronic insomnia, try watching this!",1361491200,,1243,4.248945147679325

3423647,3,B00195FUEG,"The curious movie goer should always be willing to engage with a story that hasn't been told or one that's told in a new way. This is where Turn the River gets off to a good start. The lead and supporting performances are all good and bring some humanity to some otherwise unsympathetic characters. The problem is that setup has dug such a deep moral hole for Kailey that you can't really cheer for her especially as she embarks upon a strategically, legally, and ethically dubious endeavor.

Of course we want a good outcome for her son Gulley, but the path the film sets out for them will make that outcome either unbelievable or worse than what he's already facing. The title cleverly combines Kailey's gambling with the challenges we faces once fate and our decisions have set us on a particular path. The story, however, forces Gulley to accept the lesser of two evils without giving him any say in his destiny.

Gulley's parents and grandmother are all ill-equipped to give him a happy, loving home, and since he's only a spectator in their misdeeds, there's a sort of helpless feeling for him that the story has no way of resolving. Worth seeing for the performances and the (albeit flawed) originality, and definitely the pool shots, just don't set your expectations too high.",1313366400,2,1284,4.727678571428571
3423648,3,B00195FUEG,"***1/2

Hardscrabble single moms appear to be all the rage in indie dramas these days. That may account for why, after ""Frozen River,"" ""Sleepwalking"" and the like, ""Turn the River"" doesn't feel quite as original and fresh as it otherwise might.

Kailey Sullivan is a down-on-her-luck pool hustler who doesn't even have visitation rights with her 11-year-old son who lives with his abusive dad and stepmother. Kailey's plan is to make just enough money at the tables to enable her to grab the kid and head north of the border.

Written and directed by Chris Eigeman, ""Turn the River"" has a nice feel for the rhythms and tones of everyday life, with the drama as understated as the performances. The scenes between mother and son are particularly well conceived and executed. There is sensitive, thoughtful, subtle work by Famke Janssen as Kailey; Jaymie Dornana as her son, Gulley; Matt Ross as Gulley's dad; Lois Smith as the boy's paternal grandmother; and Rip Torn as the pool hall owner who sets up matches for the cash-strapped Kailey and serves as go-between for her and her son.

Even the melodrama at the end is nicely underplayed, so much so that we can forgive the air of dj vu that hangs over much of the work.",1265932800,2,1220,4.713615023474178
3423649,5,B00195FUEG,"This is one of best low-key movies I've seen.  Usually movies like this become a sentimental wreck, but Famke Janssen is just too cool for school.  Any other actress and I would not have even watched this movie.  Her performance, along with the music, mood, and setting, provide a feast of atmosphere.  I completely sympathize with those who don't like this kind of film.  All I can say is that, in this particular case, all those reasons many will not like it are probably the same reasons that I happen to love it.

Any who saw Famke Janssen on the atrocious ""Nip/Tuck"" will find the POLAR OPPOSITE of Ava Moore in Kailey Sullivan.",1239148800,,633,4.557522123893805
3423650,4,B00195FUEG,"I'm so happy I could cry.

Finally, a performance that is worthy to carry the name of Famke Janssen.  I have been a huge fan of this girl since I first saw her in `Goldeneye' and then in the `X-Men' films.  She just had this chemistry with the camera, this infectious hold over the audience.  Sure, the movies were nothing extraordinary (although `X2: United' is a spectacular `super hero' movie) but she always brought a spark that I just fell in love with.  Then I saw her on the FX series `Nip/Tuck' and I was blown away.  Her development of character was stunning from beginning to end.  I found myself wondering why she couldn't find a character like that to play on the big screen.

Kailey Sullivan is nothing like her feisty turn as Ava Moore, but this is finally the big screen performance that matches her talent.

Kailey is a pool shark struggling to connect with her son, Gulley.  She has no visitation rights and has to sneak around to see him, but the bond is there and her heart breaks for every moment she can steal away with him.  Kailey decides that she wants to be with her son, permanently, and so she devises a plan to hustle enough money (playing billiards) to run away with him, leave the country.

The film has a very nice flow to it, which I didn't expect.  The pool scenes are very well shot and interesting, something else I didn't expect.  I just watched `The Hustler' a few nights back and reviewed it a few days ago, mentioning that the pool scenes were shot poorly and were boorish.  That is surprisingly not the case here.  A lot of that has to do with the fact that Famke Janssen is so engaging that even when she is staring down her cue-stick at a group of seemingly harmless pool balls we can feel the intensity of the moment.  Her grasp of character is flawless, seriously.

The film is not perfect, and its main imperfection comes at the very end.  Many reviewers have griped about this very point, and I'm going to gripe again.  The film is short (a little over 90 minutes) and it builds itself up quite well throughout the first three quarters of the film, but the last fifteen minutes or so fall to pieces.  The film spirals down rapidly, as if it had built up all this tension for nothing, and then just ends.

I hate to say it, but I hate the ending.

That said, Famke Janssen makes up for it, and then some.  She embodies Kailey with this marvelous naturalism, this uneasy confidence that comes with parenthood.  You can read the worry, the pain, the struggle all over her face, but you can also see the excitement when her son is around and the happiness he brings her.  She gives such a real and mature performance.  I'm ashamed that the `Independent Spirit Award' body didn't nominate her for this riveting and mesmerizing performance.  I just hope that Famke can catch a few more breaks like this one; then maybe one day she'll be an Oscar contender.

Then I'll really be crying.",1229040000,,2925,4.445488721804511

8272052,2,B00195FUEG,"To this avid pool player, Turn the River was like a dry break: Lots of anticipation but ultimately unsatisfying. Table action was weak and unconvincing and there wasn't nearly enough of it. I give credit to Famke, she obviously took some instruction, but whomever consulted with her didn't take it far enough for her to appear like an actual player. If anything, this film gave me more respect for Tom Cruise in Color of Money. He was still shaky, but close enough to suspend belief. (What I wouldn't give for another Jackie Gleason!)

The film makers were brave to try to bring one-pocket to the screen. For anyone unfamiliar with one-pocket, think chess on a pool table. It's often slow and arduous. Unlike rotation games such as 9-ball, one-pocket is nearly 100% strategy and a single game often takes 30 minutes or longer. Also unlike 9-ball, good one-pocket play is subtle with minimal movement. It doesn't translate well to film. That said, watching a one-pocket match on Youtube between two pros is incredible and I highly suggest checking it out.

The story was mediocre and in spite of how much I enjoy Famke Janssen and Rip Torn they were unable to rescue the film.

Incidentally, the next time someone decides to make a film involving pool, they really need to talk to CSI (Cue Sports International) or the POVPOOL guys on Youtube before shooting. Those folks know all the right angles to put a pool table on screen.",1486339200,2,1427,4.745967741935484
