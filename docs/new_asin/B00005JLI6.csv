1475576,1,B00005JLI6,"I caught this movie on cable a couple of weeks ago, and it really met my expectations of my hating it with a passion!  I really cannot stand these movies.  It's not even good comedy.  It's more embarassing than anything.  These movies have little or no plotlines, overdone characters, and just plain no point.  This is just one in a long line of bad movies like Baby Boy, How to be a Player, Kingdom Come, and that one w/Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan.
First let me echo other posters when I say that Gabrielle's acting was way over the top.  She could have played evil without seeming cartoonish.  She seemed to be trying to hard to convince the audience that she was the evil sister.  I also have trouble believing that these grown women would allow themselves to be controlled by her the way that they were.
Nothing about the plot was convincing.  From them getting together, to them falling in love, to the wack ending.  And what the husbands do to keep Ray away from Eva is so much more serious than the comedic spin they tried to place on it.
Just a pointless movie.",1060646400,4,1069,4.408163265306122
1475577,3,B00005JLI6,"In the behind-the-scenes documentary that's featured in the ""Deliver Us From Eva"" DVD, its star Gabrielle Union says that ""there are a lot of firsts in this movie that we haven't seen before, ever.""  Well, having watched this film, I can attest that her comment isn't entirely true.  ""Deliver Us From Eva"" actually covers charted territory, as the script is really an urbanized retelling of ""The Taming of the Shrew.""  Union takes the ball and runs with it as Eva, a no-nonsense, take-the-bull-by-the-horns woman who controls the lives of her three sisters and their relationships.  The men who are dating these women are up to their ears with her controlling ways, so they call upon the help of Ray (LL Cool J), whom they pay to date and dump Eva so she can stop meddling into their private lives.  I would have been more forgiving if ""Deliver Us From Eva"" were smooth enough to glide over its flaws, but they stick out like zits on a 14-year-old.  While the film is watchable, the script sometimes tries too hard to get its point across, has clumsy dialogue and predictable one-liners, and is mostly surprise-free to the average moviegoer.  Plus, I often found it hard to believe that these grown women are so empty-headed that they'll uncritically follow whatever instructions their sister gives them.  I mean, what's so great about Eva? How did she get on such a high pedestal and what makes her so incredibly superior to the other ladies?  The movie doesn't give a convincing answer and falters as a result.  But it's still worth a look solely for Union, who lights up the screen in a role that's simultaneously irritating yet hilarious.  Leaving no room for ambiguity, Eva makes it clear to everyone (even her local minister) that her way is the right way.  LL Cool J (credited as James Todd Smith in this movie) continues to show promise as an actor, but if his performance indicates anything, it's that he still needs to learn how to completely relax in front of a camera.  Still, Smith possesses a warmth in ""Eva"" we haven't witnessed in his prior films such as ""Any Given Sunday.""  To be honest, ""Deliver Us From Eva"" is really a 2-star movie, but I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give it an extra star solely because of Gabrielle Union.  Even as the movie threatens to collapse, she holds herself together, which is no mean feat considering the second-rate material she had to work with here.",1060300800,5,2406,4.708830548926015
1475578,5,B00005JLI6,"This film is so cute and fun, what's not to like? Yeah, Eva is over the top, but it's a comedy, so sit back and laugh. It reminded me of 'Two Can Play That Game' in a good way.
LL Cool J is a great actor and it's surprisingly easy to separate him from his old school rap persona. I especially loved Robinne Lee (from 'Hav Plenty' and 'National Security') in this too, as one of Eva's sisters. She is a great actress who will go far!",1059436800,6,432,3.9770114942528734
1475579,5,B00005JLI6,"Alright,alright, so Gabrielle Union played this role a little over the top,especially when she directs the chior, but she did what she was paid to do, play a manhating,overprotective sister who overstepped her boundaries when the game was already over. Her sisters had grown up, they all did well and had decent husbands or men, it was time for her to move on. Now it is a shame when your own brothers in law got to pay top dollars to take their sister in law out of their hands. Nevertheless, I really thought the movie would have been a bit much, but I judged wrong. This was really a good picture. Though I felt that the guys went way and over beyond the hill here, but all in all,it was a good film.",1058400000,3,703,4.293233082706767
1475580,1,B00005JLI6,"I can't even begin to tell you how much this movie stunk. I knew even before my boyfriend rented it that this was not going to appeal to me, but I thought just maybe I would be pleasantly surprised...... HOWEVER it was even Worst than I thought. From the first opening scene with the Dancers and singers... what was up with that??? I mean am I watching a Video or a movie is this like the new trend with Urban Movies to have your movies look like a Music Video?
I mean who directed this? Gabrielle was OVER THE TOP in her reactions and mannerisms (sp?) I kept rolling my eyes when she would go off (which she did quite a bit)and the way she spoke to everyone. I've seen her do a better job, but every African American actress has to have their own {BAPS} right? LOL
LL Cool J still doesn't look comfortable (at least to me) in his acting. I would probably say that LL did better in {Any Given Sunday} the other actors in this movie were also a bit nerve racking, and I sensed a bit of ""cooning"" on all parts, but that seems to be ""okay"" in todays Urban Comedies...
As I mentioned the storyline/plot is pretty much {Taming of the Shrew} but they throw in some other things into the story that made me wonder why they were even in the movie. This movie was not even THAT funny to me I mean I may have laughed after watching for a 1/2 hour in. Eva has so much control over her sisters that it was not even BELIEVABLE after a point and the men are made to look like they have no Juevos at all.. which I find hard to believe with Brothas it just got to the point where her control wasn't even plausible. Over the Sisters and their spouses/significant others.
I would suggest the movie {10 Things I Hate About You} over this it does a much better job at potraying a ""shrewish"" woman and the man who has to seduce her. If you really are interested see the original movie with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.

1475581,4,B00005JLI6,"I never got a chance to go see this movie when it hit the theaters. I rented it not knowing what to expect. After watching it on DVD, I can say that I would not have minded paying the price of the movie ticket to see this movie. It's not all that glamorous, but what it is is a nice feel-good, respectable movie. Gabrielle Union does a nice job playing a rude, obnoxious, man-hating sister by the name of Eva. At times she takes it over the top, but that's acting and that's what she gets paid to do. Eva is bent on taking care of her little sister's who all lean to her for advice instead of their men. The sister's love Eva and listen to her as if her word were the gospel. The men, on the other hand, hate her guts and want nothing more than to see her leave town. She often interferes with her sisters' relationships and makes it a point to drive her sisters' men crazy. So, in order to bring proper order to their respected relationships the men plot to get Eva out of their lives. Thus the need for Ray (LL Cool J). Ray is a smooth-talking playa with serious game. The men talk Ray into dating Eva to get her out of their lives. Ray agrees and thus the story begans with two people falling in love with each other that weren't supposed to fall in love. That's when things get messy for Ray and Eva. Some parts of the movie were a little outrageous and the ending was not the best, but all in all it was still a pretty good movie. I've read some of the reviews on this movie and other movies as well. My thing is that if you want real life situations, go watch a drama or a real life story. This is comedy...comedy's not supposed to be real. It's really an escape from reality. Don't we all need that right about now? Anyway, besides the ending, this movie was well done with the supporting actors doing a great job of playing out their respected roles. Furthermore, the women in this movie are pretty fine. Also, LL did a nice job playing Ray. I have a lot of respect for him as an actor. He didn't over play his part, but he made it believable. All in all, I give this movie a B+. The ending was a little cliche.",1057104000,9,2119,4.120772946859903
1475582,3,B00005JLI6,"""Deliver Us From Eva"" is an amusing comedy about a family of sisters, and the men who they are with.  Two of the sister's are married, one has a boyfriend, and the other.....is Eva(Gabrielle Union).  Eva is a hard nosed, don't take anything from anyone, especially men, person.  Not only that, she basically controls the lives of her three sisters.  This does not sit to well with their men.  All the men really want is to get Eva out of their hair so they can live happily with their wives.  It'll take a pro to do the job.  That's where player Ray(LL Cool J) comes in.
This is suprisingly a very amusing film.  I went into the movie with rather low expectations.  However, the film is very satisfying, except for the formulaic ending.  One thing that works for the film, is they loveable, and attractive characters.
Everyone is likeable, and it's a joy to watch these people talk.
The film and dialouge gets a little goofy in some spots, but all around the film is pretty funny.  I found myself smiling alot, and chuckling as well.
The performances are also good.  Gabrielle Union plays Eva well, even though at times she tends to overact.  LL Cool J also is good as Ray, and he has a certain charm about him that I've never really noticed before.
At the end, things get a little crazy, and at times stupid, but the overall effect of the movie is positive.  ""Deliver Us From Eva"" provides a good time, but not much more than that.",1056412800,12,1432,4.436781609195402

1475997,5,B00005JLI6,"I like this movie even if it is a bit on the ""hoaky"" side.

This video is a really good romance ad both Gabrielle and LL did a great job together.  It's funny, sexy, sweet and clever.  Most of all, it's just fun to watch.

Basically, ""Eva"" (Gabrielle) is an over-protective big sister who has become a man-eater in order to keep men at a distance.  She'd been hurt years before by a man who wanted her to choose him over her sisters, so she chose her sisters (who she was raising).  Her sisters are all in good relationships now, but Eva is still protecting them from being hurt regardless.

The men who love Eva's sisters can't take Eva's involvement in their lives anymore, so they pay a Player (""Ray"" played by LL) to date her, make her happy, keep her away from her sisters, and then dump her.  Ray goes for it, but then ends up falling for her.

What I really like about this story is how Ray and Eva soften around each other. Their characters grow because of each other, and those kinds of movies are rare to find.

Plus, it's just really funny.

So, if you want a sweet, romantic comedy to watch, I highly recommend this one.",1382400000,,1132,4.2924528301886795
1475998,4,B00005JLI6,"The movie ""Deliver Us From Eva"" has a very good cast including Gabrielle Union, LL Cool J, Duane Martin, Essence Atkins and others.  The plot is pretty straight forward as some men involved in relationships need to have Evageline Dandridge out of their way so that their relationships can progress without her heavy duty controlling of her sister's lives.  Eva has strong opinions about men and never hesitates to voice these opinions much to the chagrin of the men and the women involved.  The men come up with the idea of getting someone to date Eva to take her mind off of their and their women's lives.  Enter LL Cool J who is basically a playboy who loves women and leaves them.  It should be noted that Eva controls the purse strings of a trust so the sisters are sort of under her control.
Naturally in this case, the LL Cool J character, Raymond, falls for Eva in a big way and cannot dump her which was the plan.  When she moves to Chicago from LA for a new job, he even pursues her to tell her he actually does love her.  They ride off into the sunset in Chicago together.
The unfortunate part of the film is the fake funeral that the men plan after kidnapping Ray and keeping him tied up in an abandoned warehouse because they believe that he has double crossed them by not dumping Eva as was the original deal.
This part of the movie keeps the movie from being better than it is.  Therefore, I would say that seventy five per cent of the movie is fine but twenty five per cent of it is very weak.  Oh well, you cannot have everything.
There are no surprises in the movie and everything that happens is pretty much predictable.  The cast is fine and very good looking,  the script is okay except for the aforementioned funeral scene.  All in all, I liked the movie and a lot of people will enjoy it.  It is what it is, a romantic comedy featuring a mostly Black cast.

  A strong charismatic and beautiful Gabrielle Union plays Evangeline (""Eva"") Dandridge, a young woman who had to grow up quickly, beginning work as a health inspector to support her younger sisters after the deaths of their parents in a car accident when she was 18.
 But now that her sisters, Kareenah( Essence Atkins), Bethany(Robinne Lee),and Jacqui(Megan Good), are financially set as a doctor, beautician, and college student respectively, doing alright for themselves, and are either married or in relationships, the three men, including Kareenah's husband, Tim( Mel Jackson), Jacqui's husband Darrell(Dartanyan Edwards), and Bethany's boyfriend, Mike( Duane Martin), resent Eva's frequent encroachment upon their lives, and the sisters' mindlessly following her lead to the detriment of their relationships with them.
 We see Eva as a perfectionist in both her job, as a tough and intimidating health inspector, and as the conductor of her church choir.
 The story reaches a crucial point when a decision is made about the sister's inheritance, that the men dislike.
 Meeting at a bar, they hire a womanizing player with a history of instability named Ray Adams(L.L. Cool J) to date Eva in order to decrease her influence over  their lives. But as Eva has left many men emotionally damaged in her wake, it will be quite a task.
 Along for this excursion are Kym Whitley as Ormandy and Royale Watkins as Telly, Bethany's co-workers in the beauty shop that is a ""woman's sanctuary"" into which most males justifyably fear to tread, and during an encounter with Eva's old flame, Lucius Johnson(Dorian Gregory) and his wife, Renee( Kenya Moore), we see how much Eva had to sacrifice when she was young, but the uncomfortable moment is comically redeemed by Ray.
 Instead of wanting to date Eva for money, Ray actually comes to love Eva, who changes as a result. But once given a professional opportunity for advancement, which could easily result in the men getting what they want, Eva may decide to give that up as well because of Ray. In the meantime, the men's scheme backfires because now, all the sisters do is talk about Ray and Eva, and they are still deprived of more time with their respective wives/sweethearts.
 A nasty confrontation with Ray after he backs out of the deal leads to the truth of their scheme coming out, and there is the bitterness of betrayal, and separation before all will be resolved.
 Having known too many African American males who are willing to bring down high achieving and assertive female counterparts who display moral values, I'd say this tale rings true to a degree. But I can feel a little better about a final desire for an honorable relationship in the end. Perhaps even that Bard of Stratford-Upon-Avon would be amused.",1344556800,,2953,5.04312114989733
1476120,2,B00005JLI6,"I suppose its really hard for me to be objective about this movie, since I couldn't finish watching it.  This character was a bit unbearable to watch.  Extremely bossy, nosey, meddlesome, cruel, nasty, obnoxious characters such as this was not amusing for me.  It may seem funny to watch for some, but there are actual people that treat others like this.  The worst thing a person can do is let others run their lives.  It doesn't matter if its a family member, which could be more devastating.

Sure they were poking fun at relationships such as this, but it became overbearing.  The sisters depended on each other for support, but there has to be a line drawn.  It was apparent that Eva was an unhappy person, and her sister's felt compelled to give her their support. It was obvious, that they were getting a little tired of her behavior as well.  It seems as though they did not want to hurt her feelings.  But again, there has to be a line drawn.

It is an all-time favorite of many families, particularly, the women in those families because it shows you that you should set your standards high but keep your personal business (love, sex, etc.) to yourself!

Summary of plot from Rotten Tomatoes

Synopsis: A trio of men plot to free themselves of their mates' unattached and seemingly omnipresent older sister Eva. Eva has a sweet face but a steely... A trio of men plot to free themselves of their mates' unattached and seemingly omnipresent older sister Eva. Eva has a sweet face but a steely disposition: a few choice words from her and a once-confident man becomes a virtual basket case. Eva has been in charge of her younger sisters ever since their parents died, many years ago. The mere fact that they're married or engaged hasn't deterred her one bit from continuing to take charge of their lives. But the cost of putting family first has been the deferral of her own dreams--and the assumption of a harder-than-nails personality that no man has been able to crack. Eva's uncanny ability to interfere with her sisters' affairs has not endeared her to their spouses and partners. The men would also like to close out and divide the family trust fund that Eva oversees. So they concoct a simple plan: compensate cash-strapped ladies' man Ray Adams to romance and distract Eva from her financial duties. Sparks fly between Ray and Eva--but the plan goes awry, leading to surprising consequences and complications",1296604800,,1709,4.961538461538462

1476190,4,B00005JLI6,"Yeah, this movie is kind of predictable. The ending could have been seen a mile away but I like this movie a lot. It was recommended to me by the same friend who recommended American History X to me. He wasn't wrong about that movie and he wasn't wrong here. I was skeptical about seeing Gabrielle Union(who is too fine for words) playing a feisty character but the movie was a lot better than the previews led me to believe.

Story: 3 brothers who are constantly hen-pecked by their girlfriends' sister Eva hire a player named Raymond(played by LL Cool J) to date her so they can spend more time with their mates. Raymond ends up falling for Eva when he realizes that there is more to her than meets the eye.

Gabrielle Union was perfect as the high-strung Eva. I never looked at her the same after this role until I watched the movie recently and saw that her character wasn't that bad. The people that really annoyed me were the black three stooges Mike, Tim and Darrell. I mean, kidnapping Raymond because his relationship was making theirs look bad was in bad taste. I know it's just a movie but that was pretty low what they did. I laughed a lot at Eva when her attitude changed around once she started to date Raymond. The scene where she was in the beauty salon after a night of passion with Raymond had me on the floor rolling. I know women tend to act funny after receiving great sex but man was she goofy. I'll admit that LL Cool J and Gabrielle Union made a great looking couple on screen. There is actually chemistry there and LL lends a certain charm to his character Raymond. I think we need to give LL a little more credit as an actor. When he did his first lead in Out Of Sync I laughed at him but now he's lot better. He was good in Edison Force, S.W.A.T., Deep Blue Sea, Kingdom Come and here in Deliver Us From Eva.

Critics are being too hard on this movie. Of course it's predictable but what movie isn't these days? I wasn't checking my watch every minute so that has to be a good sign. It was pretty funny at times and it was sweet. As a retelling of Shakespear's Taming Of The Shrew its pretty good. As a product of Black Cinema its one of the best romantic comedies in recent.

LL Cool J also does a standup job as Ray, the `playa' whose paid $5,000 to date Eva in an attempt to get her out from controlling the lives of her three sisters.  He's paid, of course, by Eva's brother-in-laws (or soon to be depending on which sister).  What neither of them expected (except us) was for Ray to fall in love with Eva.

1476318,1,B00005JLI6,"I wanted to escape Deliver Us From Eva after watching about ten minutes of the movie. This depressing movie loosely based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the shrew grates on the nerves and makes the stomach queasy. I'm going to have to start bringing a barf bag to these black romantic comedies. The abuse that passes as love in black romantic comedies makes me sick to my stomach.

The story of Eva revolves around the men who date and are married to the Dandridge sisters, a quartet of girls led by the hostile, man hating, man devouring Matriarchal sister Eva (Gabrielle Union). The men who are dating and married to the other Dandridge sisters can't do anything with their women because the sheep won't do anything without their older sister's approval. In a mean and sinister plan to get control over their households, and the sister's trust fund, the men recruit Ray, a player (LL Cool J) and pay him to date and dump Eva. After several predictable plot twists, Ray falls in love with Eva, and she's forced to choose between him and a big promotion in Chicago. The guys who hired him aren't happy because Eva is supervising the trust fund and the sisters plan on giving it all to her. To get a cut of the money and cut Eva out of their lives, they chain up Ray somewhere and fake his death. Ray busts out of the chains and heads over to the church to reveal the truth to Eva. Eva gets angry and leaves for Chicago. Ray gives up everything he works for and heads to Chicago to convince her to take him back. We get our happy ending and the credits roll. It doesn't matter that Eva or any of the characters haven't grown or changed from their experiences; they all still have the same bad character traits at the end of the movie that they had at the beginning.

I wound up sick to my stomach from the mean spirited misogynistic picture presented onscreen as black love. Like The Brothers and The Best Man, Deliver Us From Eva is a shallow movie with cynical message about black romance. Eva presents a even more bitter picture of Black on Black Love than the latter two films, showing it as a war between the sexes where black men and black women don't see each other as human beings deserving love or being capable of it. The dark skinned Eva is shown as evil to the audience because she has an opinion and asserts herself. In this movie Eva's assertion of self is a negative character trait and any black woman who acts in such a fashion is a nasty, hostile person who men can't love. The males in this movie have to humiliate and degrade her before one of them sees her as lovable. But Eva's lighter skinned sisters are as perfect mates. The other three Dandridge Sisters are docile and submissive creatures with no personalities, no opinions of their own and no sense of direction without the guidance of a master. They're never shown as trying to have an opinion of their own or disagreeing with Eva. And the men are never shown as remorseful for their unethical inhuman behavior towards Eva or making an effort to change the way to they treat the black women in their lives. If this is the current state of romance in the black community it's a sad state of affairs. I'd like to think African-Americans could treat each other better.

Director Gary Hardwick and his two screenwriters do a poor job putting this film together, wasting time with frames that don't move the story along. The three-minute opening music video sequence where the credits roll is a waste of time that could have been cut. More time needed to been spent developing the characters into real people. Because the three writers barely skim the surface, the film the characters act like stereotypes and we barely get to know anyone. There were so many loose ends that needed tying up on this movie. I wanted to see the other Dandridge sisters develop personalities and opinions instead of being a bunch of zombies. They should have been trying to break away from Eva as much as the men wanted her gone. The men should have learned that the women in their lives were human beings with their own opinions. However, the cinematography on this film was excellent, and the production values top notch.

The one-dimensional acting combined with the one-dimensional script makes Eva come off like a made for TV movie instead of a feature film. No one makes the extra effort to needed give their characters the three dimensions needed in a feature film performance. Gabrielle Union takes it way over the top playing Eva. Her facial expressions border on cartoonish. Duane Martin does his frustrated ""All of Us"" character while LL Cool J is his smooth ""Marion Hill"" character from in the House. Essence Atkins is DeeDee from Half and Half. Meegan Goode is flat.

Avoid this misogynistic cruel movie posing as a romance. For a real love story, pick up Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman or Darryl Roberts' How U Like me Now. Directors Darren Grant and Darryl Roberts portray black love as something beautiful with balanced healthy pictures of black men and black women.",1136419200,7,5045,4.588691796008869

The idea is that the Romeo will dump Eva making her leave and then they can have control over their women and their lives.

Not to give anything away but the longer Cool Jay ""romances"" Eva, he finds himself forgetting his purpose and falling for Eva.  Also, as Cool Jay gets closer to Eva, life only gets worse for the three friends that hired him, much to their chagrin.

Cool Jay gives an excellent and believable performance as the ""player"" and the actress that plays Eva is also perfect.  There are several hilarious scenes that had me laughing out loud.

1476322,3,B00005JLI6,"Two good leads James Todd Smith aka LL Cool J (so the credit goes) and gifted Gabrielle Union raise this romatic comedy film's quality one notch higher.  The film suffers from its predictable story and some awfully stereotyped characters, but certainly there is chemistry between Ms. Union and Mr. Smith which sprinkles considerable charms on the screen.

Yet another modernized variation of Shakespearean love theme, 'Deliver Us From Eva' features Eva (Union), uptight woman who could mercilessly beat the men with her fast-spitting rapid-fire words.  Today, she organizes a book-reading meeting with three sisters of hers, and the book happens to be Toni Morrison's 'Beloved,' accompanied with the video starring Oprah.  Three guys who live with the sisters (not Eve), claims that they want to see a football game on TV, but as you see, their slightest hope is crushed by Eve before they knew it.

So, the three unhappy men talk suave lady's man Raymond (Smith) into asking man-hater Eve for date, in order to get rid of Eva' influence to other sisters, and their life.  Cool Raymond, who in turn asks for reward $ 5,000, finally agrees, and he approaches to her.  The results?  Now you know it.

It's not the thin characters that hold the center of the film, and definitely not the familiar story -- what is really wonderful is the acting of the two leading players, LL Cool J and Gabrielle Union.  LL Cool J is always a reliable actor in actions, but in this comedy he shows more tender, likable side.  But more impressive is Ms. Union, whose character Eve is not always an amiable person, who often looks like a caricature of bossy woman with an icy heart.  Actually she is not, as it turns out, but without her skilled acting Eve would have been more mean-spirited, nasty creation who makes every viewer think 'Deliver us from her.'

The film is produced by FOCUS film (which gave us gritty '21 grams'), and that is a bit surprising, but more surprising thing is that the film, unlike that Sean Penn film, lacks the bite this company could have added.  Not that I complain; but 'Deliver Us From Eva' though it is cozy and warm, could be different, different in a better, more unpredictable  way.",1096070400,2,2201,4.755263157894737

1476368,5,B00005JLI6,"What more is there to say?  The movie was GREAT.  LL was wonderful, Gabrielle Union was fabulous, and the supporting cast was simply over the top.  Loved the storyline---that of 4 sisters whose closeness and allegiance to the oldest (Gabrielle Union) drives their husbands/boyfriends crazy.  So they employ Raymond (LL), resident mac daddy, to woo Eva and get her out of their hair.  But the whole scheme backfires when Raymond develops genuine feelings for the sister from hell....and subsequently wants to ""come clean.""
This movie will have you laughing from beginning to end...you'll shed a few tears, and ultimately cheer loudly for true love to prevail.

1476370,4,B00005JLI6,"'Deliever Us From Eva' was a suprise hit, to say the least. I didn't watch it in theaters, nor did I rent it. It came on Cinemax last night and I found myself drawn into it. It suprised me that it didn't fall on it face. But suprise, LL Cool J (whom I can't really stand as an actor, nor a singer) didn't ruin the film and it turned out to be a success. The success of the film lies in Gabrielle Union (who plays Eva.) Her character plays a head strong liberal female who is a constant pain. She teaches everything she learns to her three sisters, who in turn, use all the advice on their men. After a while the three men finally find a way to get rid of Eva...set her up with a local player, (LL Cool J) Ray -- for the price of $5,000. Ray takes the challenge and soon after him and Eva are getting to know each other a little too well, and the three men can't stand the fact that Eva and Ray fall in love and both are giving her sister's advice, defeating the purpose of Ray and leading to the inevitable showdown. This film was a big suprise, it has both heart and laughter, a DVD that I will surely pick up very soon! Trust me, if you loved some of the romantic-comedy sleeper hits like 'Two Can Play That Game' and 'The Wood,' then don't miss out on 'Deliever Us From Eva.'",1078358400,2,1278,4.055335968379446
1476371,5,B00005JLI6,"""Deliver Us From Eva"" was about Eva, the eldest of the four sisters who is overprotective and overbearing in her sisters' lives and loves, needed someone in her life.  Despite the humor of this movie, the movie also shows that sistahs need love too; no matter what their attitude is.  LL Cool J does a great performance as a romantic playa.  My friend referred to this movie as a chick flick.  But guys can relate to this movie just as much as women.",1076112000,4,450,4.385542168674699
1476372,3,B00005JLI6,The movie was not as good as everyone proclaimed it to be. The story had a decent plot but it's not worth buying. Go to blockboster and rent it.,1072742400,,144,4.0
1476373,5,B00005JLI6,"I could not stop laughing with this movie.  I went to the movies to see it.  And when it came out on DVD, I made sure we added it to our collection.  It also helped that LL Cool J is FINE as wine.  If that's not one of the sexiest black men in Entertainment.  Any way, go see this movie, you will laugh. Definitly not a dissapointment.",1070755200,2,335,3.9402985074626864
1476374,5,B00005JLI6,"Because Eva was such a ""witch"" to put it nicely.  Gabrielle Union was excellent in this role as matriarch of the Dandridge family.  She was more than domineering to her sisters and their husbands.  I laughed when one of them got an enema.
I never expected her to carry her work as an inspector into her personal relationships.  One man was so damaged by her lethal tongue that he studdered when he spoke from then on. Poor Ray, (LL Cool J) wanted to give up after their first meeting, but even he saw something under that lethal exterior beating its way to the surface.  I liked the way Eva got even with the man that hurt her so long ago.  This part really made me laugh so hard other than the part where the enema took place.
I think the hardest lesson for Eva was learning how to 'let go' of the control and pain she had over her sister's lives and those that they married.
I would recommend this movie to every LL Cool J fan like myself.",1062892800,20,941,4.229050279329609
1476375,3,B00005JLI6,Not a Great movie but not terrible either.the Characters weren't fleshed out enough for me..Seemed very one dimensional..And the script was very far fetched. On the other hand it was cool to see some talented beautiful black actors on screen for a change.,1061856000,,255,4.953488372093023
