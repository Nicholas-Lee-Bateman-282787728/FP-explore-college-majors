5256123,5,B0093ICOE0,"Ever since I first read Watchmen I've been a huge fan of the story.  Soon after I read the novel I saw the movie in theaters and was blown away by how well Zack Snyder and his team adapted the story to film.  I would have loved to have bought the original ultimate cut but at the time I did not have a Blu-ray player and by the time I got one the set was going for more than double the original cost.  In the end I think I'm glad I waited because I really enjoy everything they've done with this collector's edition.

I just watched the ultimate cut for the first time after I received this set and I was very impressed.  Combine that with the superb Under the Hood feature and it really feels like the graphic novel has been brought to life.  Speaking of the novel, when I saw this collector's set had a hardcover copy of Watchmen I couldn't have been more excited.  I've always wanted a copy but many time the hardcover version of Watchmen retails for $40 by itself.  So to get a set like this with when two versions of the movie (the theatrical cut being really nice for a more casual viewing), a ton of fun and interesting special features, the motion comics, and a hardcover copy of Watchmen, this set easily contains everything I was looking for.  As a big fan of the Watchmen universe I couldn't be more pleased with this collector's edition and I would easily recommend this to other fans.",1353974400,2,1397,4.301526717557252
5256124,2,B0093ICOE0,"If WB truly wanted to make a ""definitive"" Watchmen edition, the minimum they could do is include all the cuts of the film as well as all the features from previous editions. This release instead just features the Ultimate Cut, so you are missing out on the superior (in my opinion) Director's Cut as well as the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" feature. The one real exclusive of this release is a copy of the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.

For what it's worth, the first release of Ultimate Cut is now out of print and is fetching for absurd prices on the third market so this is the better deal if you missed out the first time. That being said, WB could have easily just put the UC back in print with little fanfare. The only reason this exists is to squeeze more money out of hardcore fans, and the majority of them are just getting a fancy new packaging out of it; chances are if you're at all a fan of Watchmen you probably already own the book and if you're a fan of the film you probably already got the UC when it first came out.

As for the ""Ultimate Cut"" itself, I would recommend the Director's Cut over this. For those who don't know, the Ultimate Cut integrates the animated film ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" (also available by itself) into the main picture. It's a largely unrelated story (being a comic that exists in the world of 'Watchmen') that parallels the main one. While I admire that Snyder went out of his way to make the film as faithful of possible to the original text, this is a prime example of something that is lost in the translation between mediums. A comic-within-a-comic is far less jarring than a cartoon-within-a-live-action-movie and the segments grind the film to the halt. It works better in my opinion as a separate feature onto itself. If you had the option of watching the film and the cartoon separately, it might make for a nice 'bonus feature' but that's it.

If you're at all on the fence about this, I would recommend a rental first. Speaking as a fan of the original comic, the Director's Cut was as satisfying as an adaptation as one could expect and out of all the things I missed from Moore's story, the pirate comic was the last on the list. If Snyder had to add an extra half hour to three hour film, I would have preferred to see an actual longer cut and include pertinent scenes such as Laurie's confrontation with the Comedian or Rorschach running into his landlady and her son when he goes to retrieve his costume.

But if you have to have the Ultimate Cut and missed out the first time,  this is your best bet until WB decides to double-dip again.",1352937600,32,2622,4.420289855072464

5256126,5,B0093ICOE0,"There is a sense of irony in writing this review. Mainly because when i first saw the movie, was overly clouded by judgement due to its content of violence. This is no story about a cliche superhero team. Set in an alternate 1985, parallel to our world, Watchmen tells the story of a ""What if..superhero's existed in our world?"" possiblility.

The story is a chronicle of the lives of these individuals tarnished by the events of history & a story which all starts with the murder of one of their very own...

Watchmen is a movie with many layers. That been said; you have to watch it more than once, twice, maybe three times to fully grasp it. I speak from experience. This new collection brings about a sigh of relief for fans. Back in 2010, the movie was released in a special edition format titled, ""The Ultimate Cut"". This was the fully uncut version of the movie which included the Directors Cut release as well as Tales of the Black Freighter. The story that was told in the graphic novel ""A story within a story"" bringing the movie to an unbelieveable 215 minutes! The original Ultimate Cut stopped being pressed and was out of print. This further led dozens of people selling off their copies for a fortune.

Now you can all rejoice! The ultimate Cut is back and even better than ever. The full uncut movie, The motion Graphic Novel, awesome special features and they even throwed in the classic graphic novel by legendary writer, Alan Moore. All this in a lovely package that screams just in time for Christmas, ""Buy me!!!""",1352678400,19,1533,4.587591240875913

5256130,4,B0093ICOE0,"A really nice box set.

Love the hardcover copy of the graphic novel.  My softcover got a bit of water damage while away on vacation a couple of years ago when left near a slightly open window.  This is definitely a nice way to replace it.

This set is really only missing two things:
1) The Director's Cut
2) UV copy of Original and/or Director's Cut

While this set does come with the original cut it only includes a UV copy of the Ultimate Cut.

Just to touch on a couple of things I noticed in other reviews....  The UV code is just short of 3 years expired (at time of writing) however I use VUDU as my UV provider and have never had a problem when redeeming expired codes directly on their website and thankfully this code was not an exception.  Also I found their packaging to be more than sufficient, the Blu-Ray copies come in a recessed slot in the packaging and neither the discs nor the GN received any damage.

5256160,5,B0093ICOE0,"To sum it up:
the Watchmen Ultimate Cut is totally worth buying this edition, IF you liked the original but had the feeling ""something"" was missing OR if you liked the original graphic novel.

I enjoyed the graphic novel as well as the ""normal"" movie, but the Ultimate Cut improves the quality even more:
it adds fundermental parts from the graphic novel and fells much more ""complete"" than the, still very long, normal cut.

One downside of the extreme length is, that not every one will be able to enjoy this master piece because there are many silent moments with charakter devlopment not every one is going to like.

I bought this during the last sale for 28$ + shipping costs to europe and it's worth every cent:
the collecters edition contains the hardcover graphic novel (which alone is priced for 30 in germany), the ultimate cut and some more blu ray/dvd I still didn't manage to watch. But i watched the Ultimate Cut twice already and enjoyed it both times :D

PS:
For everyone wondering if the blu rays/dvds are running on european blu ray/dvd players:
yes they do. I tried it on my PS3, my PS4 and on an old samsung blu ray player and every time it worked very well.",1466035200,2,1178,4.516431924882629

5256179,5,B0093ICOE0,"When I saw the original cut in the theaters, I liked it (except for the ""Halleleujah"" scene); most people didn't share my opinion and I still considered the original graphic novel to be vastly superior, but I still liked it. A few years later I saw the Director's Cut, which is three hours long; I thought this version was WAY better (except for the ""Halleleujah"" scene) and I began recommending it to people again. Someone pointed out the ""Ultimate Cut"" on this version, which somehow incorporated the Black Freighter scenes from the GN; I bit the bullet and picked up the CE.

Turns out the Ultimate Cut is by far my favorite version of this movie (except for the ""Halleleujah"" scene): the scenes have enough time to breathe and revel in the period details; there's legitimately poignant footage added (I'm thinking of That Scene with Hollis); and my regard for Patrick Wilson's performance increases every time I watch this movie. I still think the movie is distinctly inferior to the GN, but the 3.5 hour cut of this movie is the best cinematic realization of this story we're ever likely to see. There are also bonus features which flesh out the world in interesting ways that aren't as engaging as I'd hoped (I'm thinking specifically of the faux Hollywood Tonight feature about the original Nite Owl book) but are still worth watching if you're curious to see everything this world has to offer. And I still maintain that people should definitely do that, because good as the GN or not, this is still a movie people should definitely see.",1452297600,17,1545,4.743494423791821

5256184,5,B0093ICOE0,"Zach Snyder's 2009 movie adaptation to Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's Watchmen came out of the gates a little rough.  Anyone who remembers its release or simply looks it up will certainly agree with that statement, regardless of your personal viewpoints on the subject.  Fortunately, though, I won't need to discuss the controversy any further since the Ultimate Cut wipes nearly all of it away.  And to think, that's just one small piece of the $50 (amazon prime) package .
  Without giving away the very intricate and complex plot (with its twists), I must say that the Ultimate Cut is certainly the most extensive and greatest version of the film.  Topping at 216 minutes, it manages to consist of roughly 51 more minutes over the standard theatrical version with.  You can see for yourself, as that too is included as disk 3.  The only reason why I bothered with the original was to see the difference in content and quality, as it is the only non-Blu Ray disk.  As a fan of the graphic novel, it was nice to see The Tales of the Black Freighter included, which minimizes the differences between the two mediums even further.  On the topic of additional content, there are also the special features in disk 2.
  The 130 minute disk 2 contains content that ranges from brief documentaries to brief ""behind the scenes""-esque videos.  Heck, there's even a music video thrown in as well.  The most impressive part, however, is the Under The Hood 38 minute short that doubles as the films prequel. After viewing every special feature I actually learned a lot about Watchmen, and I'm not talking exclusively about the film.
  Right next to the Ultimate Cut, my favorite part of the Collector's Edition is the collectible hard cover copy of the Graphic Novel.  Its great to have a hardcover version, and I was pleasantly surprised by the alterations to the novel that I only noticed after comparing it to my old paperback version.  Unfortunately, the inclusion of the book (to me, at least) made me fell even less compelled to view the almost 4 hour long Complete Motion Comic in Disk 4.
  At the end of the day, however, if something is not worth the asking price, then why bother?  Fortunately, the price actually seems too low for the content included.  Granted, it is only $50 with Amazon Prime.  With that in mind, after checking the back of the book to see that it's worth $40, I was amazed that the entire four disk Blu Ray set was only worth $10.  That's almost half the price for one Blu Ray film, let alone a pack of four totaling a little over 9 hours (excluding disk 3).  The price itself is nothing short of a miracle with all of the content thrown in to boot.

5256192,5,B0093ICOE0,"I was really blown away by this movie in theaters and was a little shocked when it got mixed reviews. I thought it was a pretty simple but interesting plot (what happens when super heroes are real? How does the average person keep them from getting out of control?) Plus the fact that it was R rated, really pushed the boundaries on a lot of areas. Obviously it is R rated for a reason, tons of violence and blood so keep the kiddies away. The theatrical cut was about 2.5 hours and the directors cut adds about 20 more minutes. With the Ultimate Edition, you get the tales of the black freighter weaved in as it was in the original comic, boosting the run time over 3 hours. This is the way to see it.

You also get the visual comic on blu ray, which I think is the best feature. It spans the entire comic run, with every panel coming to life and voiced (the animation is limited and only one person does the voice work but it works)

You also get a hard cover copy of the graphic novel as well. You can follow along in your own book if you desire.",1423008000,,1049,4.137254901960785

5256205,5,B0093ICOE0,"4.5 is my intended rating, but that's not possible on here.  I've seen Watchmen a few times and while I never found it to be bad I couldn't seem to find its appeal.  But after getting my hands on the ultimate edition, for some reason it finally clicked with me, I was finally fully invested in this film.  Zack does a pretty good job at juggling 5-6 superheros, you easily understand where each character is and was in their life, while we get a nice character piece the plot, while it isn't lacking, get's set aside (granted it's not complicated so I'll give it a pass).  Yes the movie is 3 hours plus.....so if you have the patience watch it, and if it's a bit too long there is the director's cut sooooo.

5256206,4,B0093ICOE0,"The content itself was great. I loved the nice quality hard-back graphic novel, and the disc enclosures were nicely packaged. It definitely had a high quality feel to all of it.

The only two negatives were, the box that it all came in was nicely adorned with holograms and graphics, but it was split in two different spots, making it essentially useless as a means to store the discs or the novel. I know that is mostly irrelevant, but its worth noting.

The other thing is I wish this set would have included the Directors Cut, not just the Theatrical and Ultimate Cuts of the film. The Directors Cut is the best version, in my opinion, and it was disappointing to have that not included in this supposedly end-all be-all of box sets.

Overall though, it would have been a great purchase.",1401148800,4,790,4.549295774647887

5256210,5,B0093ICOE0,"Watchmen is one of the greatest comics ever written. And this film perfectly captures everything that's great about, even adding some neat new details. This set in particular is very well-done. It is, of course, the Ultimate Cut, which comes to 3 1/2 hours. It is a bit of a long sit, but worth it, as it includes The Tales of The Black Freighter segments intermixed with the actual movie. The extras are also really nice, there's an episode of a fictional talk show with Hollis Mason, one of the original superheroes from the 40s. The creators of this film really work hard to create and expand this universe, even if it's small things like that. The comic included is nicely crafted, it's hardcover, and the inner pages feel new, but they're not all fancy and glossy, it still kinda feels like an old comic. The dust jacket is also nice to look at, even though, personally, I really hate dust jackets. Definitely the best thing about the film is the casting, specifically, Jackie Earl Haley as Rorschach. He manages to capture of his insanity, depression, determination, twisted morals, and even his strange likability he still has to a freaking ""T"". That being said, I couldn't help being a just a tad disappointed with the cast, I'm just attached to who I'd pick for the roles, but my picks would only work in an animated movie. I'd love to see Steve Blum as Rorschach and Maurice LaMarche as Doctor Manhattan. I highly recommend this to any comic book fan.",1394582400,,1461,4.644787644787645

5256216,3,B0093ICOE0,"I began by reading Watchmen, by Alan Moore, with Dave Gibbons, illustrator/letterer and John Higgins, colorist. Mine was the first print graphic novel edition, which the owner of a comic book store recommended and sold to me after my reading of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns inspired me with the desire for more of this genre.
I read Watchmen 3 times in that first month in 1988.
The movie was anticipated with great expectation when it was announced some 19 years later.
The movie, unfortunately, changed the original plot.
The ""master stroke"" (chapter XI, page 27, top pane of the orginal novel) of Adrian Veidt (Ozymandius) brought upon New York City and the world is the irreplaceable moment in the novel, which makes everything come to its denouement. That was the book, which the movie changed.
The movie betrayed Moore's genius work in a manner that is inexplicable, a paradox of screenplay writing that is at once ignorant, stupid, and critically moribund in its realization on screen. There can be no substitute as effective for this story as the original plot realization found in the original novel.
I will not argue the many other commendable and satisfying features of this film that many, many others have described in this series of Customer Reviews.
My desire is to point to Moore's novel. My hope is to have everyone here, who has not yet read his original work, to please try to do so at some time in the future. You will find there such a completely satisfying moment of art that you too will accept how for me the movie was so painful to watch as it came to an end and the final credits rolled. I apologize for not seeking to submit this review sooner than now.

5256217,5,B0093ICOE0,"This new collector's packaging that comes with the Ultimate Cut of the movie and the graphic novel is a real steal at around 40-50 bucks (depending on when you buy it).  When the Ultimate Cut was first released, I guess it was in such short supply that you were hard pressed to find it on shelves anywhere -- as a result, it used to run into the hundreds of dollars here and elsewhere (eBay, etc.), but no longer.  Now with this new set, you get a pretty cool box with the Ultimate Cut of the film and the graphic novel tucked away, neatly, inside.

As for the movie, it's much better with the Ultimate Cut (it has the extra scenes and the Black Freighter thrown back into the experience) than the theatrical version -- this is, in my opinion, the definitive Watchmen movie experience and it's as close as you'll get to Alan Moore's vision on the screen.  That being said, the movie still takes some bizarre liberties with the story (and no, I'm not mad about the changes to the climax where they remove the fake alien creature subplot) like having the human characters be super strong for some unknown reason and so the movie I would only give about 3.5 stars (theatrical version) or 4 stars (Ultimate Cut).  This is a good deal, and I would recommend scooping it up while these boxes are at a decent price...soon they'll probably shoot up to $200+ like the last Ultimate Cut edition.",1390867200,,1385,4.48015873015873

It's very distracting and I'm not even sure the comic had as much penis as this movie.  And when it was there, it was in the background, drawn as a ""u"" instead of us being ""treated"" to all these various CGI veiny close ups and bird's eye camera shots of Manhattan's undercarriage.

5256236,5,B0093ICOE0,"Having owned several copies of this film on DVD previously, including the ""Ultimate"" version from several years ago, I had been on the fence about a double dip to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  Similarly, I've got a well-worn trade of the Watchmen comic, but I haven't wanted to fork out the dough for the hardcover.  This is a great combo for people like me who most likely have a version of the film laying around and the paperback trade already.

With this, you get the most complete version of the film - the extended Director's cut with The Black Freighter integrated - along with a shiny version of the graphic novel in hard back form.  Special features carry over from the Ultimate version, and a Blu Ray of the motion comic is a nice bonus.  My only complaint would be that the Theatrical Version is limited to DVD only - but let's face it ... if you're shelling out the money for this set, you're probably not going to be watching the Theatrical cut.  The other drawback is that it's a large set, designed to accommodate the graphic novel, which means it's going to be hard to place on the shelf with your other movies.

Minor drawbacks aside, overall this is a great value for the price (at the time of purchase, right around $50 ... which is only 10 dollars more than MSRP of the hardcover novel by itself.)  The Blu Ray ultimate version has been out of print for 3 years and is currently retailing north of $100, which means this thing is pretty much a bargain no matter how you look at it.

HOWEVER - note that Ultraviolet does the following:
-  forces you to sign up for two (2) accounts
-  no longer appears to give you the option of play through itunes.
The download requires the use of the flixter player, and the on line streaming through flixter was a jittery mess.... which is definitely a problem since Netflix and Amazon vVideo both run smootly.

Aside from the online snafu, no other issues. The box everything comes in is nice ans sturdy (although definitely big) the included graphic novel is a nicely done hardcover, and there are 4 disks ( ultimate cut, special features,widescreen and motion comic).

So.... had this included an itunes version (which was an option with Ultraviolet in the past) this would have been 5 stars.

The ultraviolet version included seems more of a pain than anything, and having the director's cut on DVD would be frustrating if you don't already have that blu ray. Not having the film be a branching version where you could choose the ""ultimate"", ""director's"", or original theatrical cut is a glaring oversight, especially as there is no way to get the theatrical version on blu ray, at all.

For what's presented, it's quite good. Just don't consider it for a casual viewer.",1355616000,,559,4.646464646464646

Today it finally arrived and I can now confirm it works on my Blu-ray player.

5256245,5,B0093ICOE0,"I spent $7 to watch this in the theater when it was released and fell in love immediately. When it was released on DVD, I purchased it for $20 in store. When the Director's Cut came out, I shelled out the cash for it again, just because I had to have more. At least the Director's Cut wasn't that expensive and I only paid another $20 for it. But when the Ultimate Cut came out, I paid $50 for that box set. I began to feel like the Warner Brothers studio was purposefully screwing me over with all of these extra releases.

Why can't they just give us one very expensive collector's set with everything included? I bet I'll buy that one when it comes out too...

Regarding the Collector's Edition Ultimate Cut with Graphic Novel, I couldn't be more happy with this release. The hardback graphic novel itself is worth the $50. Plus you have a nice set with Bluray disks of the motion comic and the Ultimate Cut included. If you wanted to watch the original version on Bluray, you are out of luck here, though it is included on DVD. I wish they would have included the Bluray Director's Cut in this set as well.

I haven't had time to go through the special features disk but will update this once I have. For now I will warn you about the packaging. This box is made out of compressed paper, much like a cigar box is fabricated. The construction isn't bad at all, and the cover is great since it flashes back and forth from the comic to the film. But when mine arrived the cover was ripped due to it being slightly longer than the box. So when sitting upright (as it would on a display shelf) the cover can't help but rip at the hinge. At least the seller (Amazon) was speedy about shipping out a replacement copy, and the second time around it was shrink wrapped to a board so that it wouldn't tear.

In summary my complaints are:
No Bluray Director's Cut
No Bluray Theatrical Version
Weak design on the box

And my compliments are:
Excellent quality graphic novel
Awesome look to the case
Motion comic and Ultimate Cut on Bluray

Is it worth it? Absolutely, even if you already owned the Ultime Cut on DVD. However, I would recommend buying the Director's Cut on Bluray to compliment this package as it's a little difficult to watch with the Dark Freighter motion comic spliced in.",1355270400,,2283,4.398104265402844
5256246,5,B0093ICOE0,"I had missed the boat on the first time release of the Ultimate Cut, so this ways the perfect consolation for me. The set is now on display on the top of my media shelf that holds all of my several hundred Blu-Rays and it looks great! If you are at all a fan of this film, go pick this up.",1355097600,,289,3.7540983606557377
5256247,5,B0093ICOE0,"I got hosed on the original Director cut, thanks to a low budget website.  I was ecstatic to see this one and ordered immediately.  Even better, the price dropped $25 by the time it shipped.  Incredible movie with Black Freighter woven into it.",1355011200,,244,4.627906976744186
5256248,5,B0093ICOE0,"I know that some people have been critical of the film adaptation of Watchmen.  I happen to be one of the people who enjoyed it.  However, I was unprepared for just how much the ultimate edition would improve the quality of the film.  In reading, the black freighter was always my least favorite part.  I didn't care for it.  Only after seeing the movie without it, and then with it re-inserted to I really appreciate it's significance and symbolism.  I strongly recommend this for any fan of Watchmen.",1354320000,,502,4.6477272727272725

8535196,5,B0093ICOE0,"I love Watchmen so this was heaven for me.  The comic book compilation is great and the packaging etc but what really shines is the extra footage...this is one of the only times i can remember where all this extra footage made the movie even better and more understandable.  Don't be scared like Hollywood of the total running time this creates...it's worth it.  These scenes were not cut because they sucked (like most deleted scenes in movies), they were cut PURELY for time.  What a shame.  They're not incredible scenes, but they add more depth without feeling thrown in.",1516320000,,575,4.767676767676767

8535198,3,B0093ICOE0,"Box arrived torn at the corners, as some other reviewers have experienced. Not damaged due to shipping, but bad product design. I like the graphic on the box, as it changes from the comic characters to the actors, depending on your viewing angle. The included digital code, although expired, still worked. Unfortunately, the code is for VUDU/Google Play only. Was hoping for iTunes at least, or ideally, a Movies Anywhere update. The graphic novel is the highlight of the purchase, being of high quality and hardcover. The disc packaging itself is poorl; just a folding paper case to hold the four discs instead of a four disc blue plastic case. Blu-Ray video and audio quality is excellent.",1513728000,,691,4.914529914529915
8535199,5,B0093ICOE0,"By far my favorite CBM, shipped surprisingly fast considering it was out of stock when I purchased.

My only complaint is that the case/box that holds the novel and movie, one side was ripped/torn/broken, so after the plastic wrapping was removed, the novel and movie could easily slide out. Luckily, placed a couple small strips of clear shipping tape on and you could barely see the issue.

Overall happy with the purchase, have been waiting to watch the Ultimate Cut for a long time.",1513209600,,486,4.773809523809524

It has the graphic novel (mostly what I bought this for) and along with the amazing movie all in a beautiful container, that is if it wasn't damaged. I like most collectors like to get the COLLECTOR'S edition so we can display or store that away in our library of other cool comic book and movie related things: I was excited to get this but when I got the box the corners were beat up and showing some tear. That is not how you sell a collectors edition product. It should be sealed and stored correctly so the collector gets what they were hoping for. I'm happy with the movie and comic but the damage on the box just annoys me :/ it looks like well used.... and I just got it...",1512518400,,727,4.2
