8498892,4,B006IUT4QM,"I bought this because I love Vanness Wu (Autumn's Concerto).  This drama is OK, but the female lead is a very tall mainland Chinese model and she makes Vanness look very short, particularly when she is wearing heels, which is all the time.  (Which is weird after watching Autumn's Concerto, where he looks like a giant next to Ady An)  My favorite parts are the scenes at the market where Vanness' character's family and friends work and live.  This drama also has Annie Chen in one of her early roles.",1493596800,,502,4.544444444444444

but this drama was hard to enjoy because the subs are so bad. I think the story is cute but could not get into it ,made no sense.",1426723200,,269,4.09433962264151
