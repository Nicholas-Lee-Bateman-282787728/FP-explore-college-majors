8347735,4,B001XURPL8,"This is based on a story from WW 2, which as ever means there is a wide latitude of poetic licence. This Australian/Japanese collaboration is set in Northern Australia and tells the story of Jack a WW1 veteran who lives in deliberate isolation fighting and coming to terms with the very real ghosts that still haunt him from the so called `Great War'.

The Japanese Prisoners of War at the nearby camp have been bullied and coerced into escaping and committing ritual suicide if necessary and after they break out, Jack finds and recaptures one of them. He then looks after him until the army come to collect him.

That is the basic story but the plot develops in flash backs to both Jacks experience in the trenches of Flanders in WW 1 and the experience of Masuru in the jungles of Borneo. Both of them have done things they are trying to come to terms with and as the plot unfolds it dawns that sometimes you have to have different coping strategies..

Despite the cover showing aeroplanes and explosions, this is most definitely not a war action film, for those expecting another `Kokoda'Kokoda - 39th Battalion [DVD], or indeed the excellent `Beneath Hill 60'Beneath Hill 60 [DVD] [2010], will most likely feel a bit disappointed. However it is a study in the psychological effects of war and the awful results that accrue when excessive peer pressure is applied. In that sense it probably has its roots closer to the much ignored `The Last Bullet'The Last Bullet [DVD] [1996] (with a bravura performance from 80's heart throb Jason Donovan).

This is a well made well acted film that goes from ratchetting up the tension to being almost pedestrian. Whilst it is not a bad film it is not an excellent or classic one in the sense that most war films are. Also once again ignore the front cover as there are no aerial battle scenes at all in this film. I was going for 3 stars but give it 4 stars to reflect the fact that this was a joint Australian/Japanese film and it is actually brilliantly executed, Directed and written by Brad Haynes I hope to see more from him",1302566400,,2071,4.574123989218329
