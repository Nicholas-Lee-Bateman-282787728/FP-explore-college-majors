8664265,5,B00L89VSBC,"This is the second DVD I've purchased of Northern California Beaches produced by Herbey Productions.  I didn't think I could love another DVD as much as the first one, Northern California Beach produced in 2012, but this one is beautifully done!  There are videos of breath taking sunsets with various degrees of lighting.  Of course the sounds of the waves are very soothing.  I can watch the DVD for hours and play background music to accompany the sunsets and waves.  I feel like I'm sitting on the beach. The perfect way to relieve stress in my opinion!  I highly recommend this DVD to all ocean lovers!  I hope Seth Herbey will continue to produce more of these wonderful DVDs in the future. I'm a huge fan!",1405728000,,712,4.603174603174603
