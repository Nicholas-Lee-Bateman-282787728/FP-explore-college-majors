8357665,5,B002997SIW,"The facts are good.  And although I would have liked to see more of Sir John Franklin, his wife, and members of his expedition, the history of this mystery is fascinating and to see the decendent of the great writer of Charles Dickens and the decedent of the Inuits who came in touch with the Franklin Expedition alone is well worth the price of this DVD.
