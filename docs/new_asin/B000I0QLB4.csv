2649500,5,B000I0QLB4,"Yang Gor is a young orphan, adopted by a local hero Guo Jing and his wife Huang Rong. Tormented by his step siblings, Guo Jing reluctantly decides to foster him at a local monastery. He hopes with time the monks can curb Yang's impetuous spirit.  Unfortunately, Yang's mischievous manner alienates the monks and he eventually runs away to live with Dragon Girl, a mysterious woman who lives in a nearby Tomb. Raised by Dragon Girl, Yang becomes her disciple, and eventually falls in love with her. Gor and Dragon are shunned because love between master and disciple is forbidden. Will Gor and Dragon separate or will love conquer all?

This was a stunning epic which spans nine disks (and many hours of viewing). The cinematography is beautiful even if some of the cgi is rather bad. (Particularly the condor, the animals in the woods). I did find the 'holy foxes' to be really cute, 'tho. The subtitles are a bit strange, but easily understood. My favorite mistyped subtitle is when the various characters claim people have been 'jeopardized.' I think they mean killed or slain or harmed, but the word 'jeopardized' is used. It's amusing.

RE: Plot: At first, Gor is very difficult to like. He starts off as an ugly little boy whose tricks aren't always that nice. At times it's easy to see why people don't like him. But eventually, this character grew on me. He is far from from perfect... Which was refreshing. Dragon girl, his lover was beautiful, kind, and sweet but rather bland. She spends the latter half of the series sort of 'out of commission' which was a bit of a drag. I found Guo Jing to be charming and his wife was good too. I was irked with Wu who is a brat. Xiang is an obnoxiously pert ""Scrappy Do"" Scene stealer, and towards the end, too many plot threads involved this character.

Overall, this was a vastly entertaining series, particularly the first 6 DVD's.

Be warned, there is something wrong with this listing. This is not the first error I've seen with Amazon's HK film database.  There are several versions of Condor hero, and the DVD jacket and actors may not be right. This review refers to ""Return of Condor Heroes"" which is the picture on this product page.",1191715200,10,2191,4.648578811369509
2649501,4,B000I0QLB4,Is this the series with Andy Lau (TVB) or the newer one produced by the mainland CCTV?  This is confusing.  The image indicate it is the newer series but the description match the older series.  I hope the customers will be aware of this.,1184457600,2,238,4.363636363636363
2649502,4,B000I0QLB4,"This series starts off a little typical and a little slow (as in not good at getting you really involved) but that soon changes.  I'm now a prisoner of this series until I get to finish watching it.  I am so sucked in.  I'm sucked in as much as usually only the Korean shows can make me.

Condor Hero is a perfect blend of love story and kicka** wuxia.  Wow.  It's perfect to watch with your guy/gal--both will be pleased.

The subtitles aren't so bad as others have mentioned here.  They're fine.  The picture quality is great. (I never saw fire look so good.)

Only problems I have with the show is the repeated insertion of music from the movies ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2"".  Umm, they don't think we're gonna recognize it?  Anyway, it's distracting.

There are a lot of CG beasties in this show too, which is pretty cool except for a fake-lookin' leopard(cougar?) and these crocodiles that have the ability to pounce 12 feet out of the water and then look rubbery.  Ha!  But don't let that stop you.  The giant CG condor looks great!

There's lots of action, romance, characters, plot twists, surprises (one episode had so many I--I couldn't take it!)

It's just a damn good show.  And the leading lady is a hottie.

P.S. Be careful with some of these other reviews -- spoilers in there.",1179014400,12,1291,4.5064935064935066
2649503,3,B000I0QLB4,"I'm giving 3 stars for the dvd quality, not the drama itself, for two reasons:

-  The english subtitle is REALLY bad... there are mistakes in translation and also the grammar is improper, as if being translated by a 5th-grader.  The transliteration is also wrong.  Xiao Long Nu calls him Guo'er, not Gor!

- The picture is grainy, letter-boxed, and the subtitles appears in big ugly yellow in between the black bars.  For those with widescreen hdtv and would like to see Liu Yifei in all her beautiful glory will be  disappointed.",1178668800,3,531,4.706521739130435

2649506,2,B000I0QLB4,"Coming right off of finishing Laughing in the Wind and into this series was probably not a good thing....I'm half-way through and debating if I should wrap this as a Christmas gift for some of my unsuspecting ""TV serial newbie friends"". Not really anything to brag about - the plot seems very simplistic, but tries too hard to be deep and significant. TOO MANY slow-motion ""glamour shots"" and ""sticatto"" action scenes.

I wouldn't recommend spending so much money on something like this....",1165795200,2,490,4.975609756097561
2649517,4,B000I0QLB4,"This series is an adaptation of Louis Cha (Jin Yong)'s second novel ""Return of the Condor Heroes,"" within his ""Condor Trilogy.""  While this story is fine ""stand-alone,"" I do recommend viewing one of the various adaptations of the first novel ""Legend of the Condor Heroes"" as many, many characters are in both.  I think part of the thrill of watching this series is seeing those previous characters show up within this story.  It also helps you understand how powerful these figures are supposed to be, adding to their grand appearances.  While by itself, the series does explain many of the important details of each respected character, you really don't get the full effect of how great some of these figures are supposed to be, without a complete understanding of their history.

While I did enjoy this series, I have to admit that the beginning is extremely annoying.  If or when I re-watch this series, I don't even plan to watch the first disc again.  The child Yang Guo is so annoying, it makes you angry.  He is also somewhat out of character.  Even without any knowledge of his character, he's just plain annoying.  Even worse is when Huang Xiaoming takes over as the young adult version of Yang Guo and he still remains annoying.  But luckily, as the series moves on, he matures, and is much more enjoyable to watch, and by the end of the series is very likable.  I understand this progression is on key with what a normal viewing of Yang Guo as a character should be.  But there is a difference between dislike and almost unwatchable.  So I would advise to just be patient, after about the 10th episode, it gets really good and the story is great.  You just have to muscle through the first few episodes or better yet, if you know the story, just skip them.

Unlike Yang Guo`s character, Liu Yifei's (Crystal Lau) portrayal of Xiaolongnu (Dragon Girl) is simply perfect, even getting the approval of Jin Yong himself.  She has a natural beauty and demeanor that really embodies Xiaolongnu and realistically conveys Xiaolongnu's cold, expressionless, anti-social, ghost-like behavior almost flawlessly.  Even her love to Yang Guo seems very much in tact with how you would expect such an introverted character to act.  I feel that if Liu Yifei had no spoken lines in the series, you would know exactly what emotions she is expressing while remaining expressionless (I know this sounds like a strange thing to say, but you just have to see her to understand), which really tackles the very root of what Xiaolongnu represents.

For the most part, I thought all of the fight scenes were pretty good and enjoyable.  Similarly to most shows in this genre these days, there was a good amount of CG used and all were far from great, but bearable compared to most Wuxia series I've seen.  You might recognize many of the music used in the soundtrack to many Hollywood productions, but you have to understand that this was made for Chinese audiences, who are less familiar with American works, so this aspect didn't bother me as much as some people.  Although, I would have preferred that they just stuck to a pure original soundtrack.  The original music they did use on the other hand, does fit very well.  So I would have to say that overall the music is a good accent to the series.

Another negative aspect in my opinion is that the series is too pretentious at moments.  While I'm not totally opposed to artistic imagery within any film or show, I think the duration becomes tedious.  Certain scenes will be these beautiful environments which at first are very appealing, but they last way too long, to the point of pointlessness.  Still, as mentioned earlier, this was still a very enjoyable series as it went on, as with all of Jin Yong's works you really get to know the layers in the many characters in his stories.  Although some aspects might be beyond modern expectations in terms of themes of love and loyalty, it is this unrealistic view that attracts us to these stories.  Even without the great CG work of Hollywood or with the almost clich, sometimes predictable revelations, there is still something that the Chinese produce so well in this type of production, and is unique beyond  anything else in visual media.",1250035200,3,4232,4.723433242506812
2649518,5,B000I0QLB4,This movie followed along with the story pretty well. I particularly enjoyed the drama and scenery. For any fans of China dramas involving ancient times will love this movie as it has everything from romance to action to suspense to thriller.,1240272000,,242,4.926829268292683

2649520,5,B000I0QLB4,"This series has it all, action, romance, martial arts, culture, history and deep philosophy. Once you pass the first couple episodes, you will be sucked into it.  I guarantee you'll fall in love with the love story and all the uniqueness of all the characters.

The title of this movie should be Return of the Condor Hero. This is the second generation where the main character who is the son of the villain of the first series becomes the hero.

Many companies made this series, but I must say, this is the best version. There are some extraneous and slow parts but these parts were necessary to reveal the love and hardships the characters endure. Yes, the giant condor and crocodiles are unrealistic but compare to Lord of the Rings' walking/talking trees, the condor and crocodiles are pretty real. And yes, people flying around can be distracting but hey if James Bond can duck hundreds of flying bullets, why can't ancient people fly? Besides, these movies are supposed to elicit fantasies. If you want to watch ""realistic"" movies, watch a documentary.

If you're non-Asian and don't understand why the main characters are forbid to love each other, it is because at that time, a master/teacher is someone you have to respect as a parent. For a student to love his master is viewed as incest.",1236297600,2,1298,4.7555555555555555
2649521,4,B000I0QLB4,"It's a little irritating that the product information provided for this special-cover box set is incorrect.  The dvd set that is depicted inside the box is the 2006 live-action tv series from China, not the Japanese-produced animated series in the description.

Condor Hero is based on the extremely popular novel by author Jin Yong, which is customarily titled Return of the Condor Hero in most English translations of the story title (the novel itself hasn't been translated into English).  This represents the second story in a trilogy, preceded by Legend of the Condor Heroes (also known as Eagle-Shooting Heroes) and followed by Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber.  Return of the Condor Hero has been adapted for television many times, but it's refreshing to see it done outside the confines of a studio, with a big enough budget to handle the sweeping action and intense martial arts scenes.

Sadly the subtitles are a bit of a disappointment, but some of the mistakes are understandable given the differences in grammar and vocabulary between Mandarin and English.  If you purchase this dvd set I would recommend setting the audio track to Mandarin, since that is the language in which it was filmed and you'll be able to hear most of the actor's actual voices that way rather than dubbed Cantonese voices.

While some changes were made to the story, the script hews fairly close to the novel, often taking whole scenes directly from the book.  The liberties that were taken were mostly to compress the story into a smaller number of episodes - the series has 41 episodes as it is.

If you enjoy martial arts action and don't object to extensive use of ""wire-fu"" and digital effects, you'll enjoy this series.  If you're expecting digital effects of the quality you'd see on an American television programme, you'll be disappointed.  You may also be disappointed if you want lots of action without much plot.  This story has an extensive plot and a great deal of romance, since it's essentially a story of two star-crossed lovers making their way through the martial arts world.

I personally think this is the best version of Return of the Condor Hero available.  The casting and performances are excellent, the locations are gorgeous, and the martial arts scenes aren't bad (your mileage may vary).  The only flaws I can really complain of are the poorly-translated subtitles and the use of incidental music taken from other sources, notably the Harry Potter films.  Those flaws aren't enough to lessen my recommendation.",1210291200,,2525,4.961995249406176
2649522,4,B000I0QLB4,"I got this set from Walmart for ~$44 after tax.  Just a note.
This set comes in okay hard plastic case, with a cardboard box encases it.  Pretty nice 9 DVDS in set of 2 on each side of the flips (don't know of a better way to describe this, when you see it, you can tell me how to better phrase it) so the DVDs have a place for each of them to be in and not rattling around in the box.
With TV series like this, you can't expect perfect English.  There are things that only makes sense if you know the genre and the culture, and the way the translations were done, I can tell the translators have problems conveying these ideas.  I've read the story and watched so many TV versions of it, I know by heart what will happen and still, I enjoy this series for what it is.
The theme song is kinda nice and remind me of the 'good' 1995 version.
I have a widescreen HDTV and in order to read the subtitle, I have to leave it in the letterbox format, if you don't need the subtitle, Zoom and voila, you'd fill that nice widescreen.  It wasn't rainy and face it, compare to the VHS of the old day and the quality of the dvds you get from Chinatown, this is superior, not as good as the the (American) TV series Hero on HD but still good.
Other than that, the storyline is overused. Every couple years or so, they will remake these series with newer actors and costumes.  I have a copy of the 1995 version, still re-watch it every year or so.
Other than that, I only wish they'd cast some cuter actors to pair with the already cute actresses.",1207699200,,1533,4.093333333333334
2649523,4,B000I0QLB4,"...to get an accurate analysis of the version in one of these reviews? The only other review was a straight out of the manual ""How to Get your Review Rated as Helpful"" by amazon, which basically just tells you to agree with popular opinion. No, to be HELPFUL you need to give information that helps others. For instance, instead of telling how it's like House of Flying Daggers, actually have watched the version, and tell us enough about it that we can figure this is out.  Otherwise, we are stuck wondering if this movie called Condor Hero is in fact ""Legend of Condor Hero"", ""Return of Condor Hero"", or the third one.  As it is, the only thing I can say is that if it is 2001, and Return of Condor Heroes was 2006, it probably isn't that version.  By the way, Amazon unknowingly released Return of Condor Heroes, as Legend of Condor Heroes because it was actually printed as such in English. This is a very confusing mess, so it helps if you tell DETAILS.",1205366400,,958,4.431818181818182
2649524,5,B000I0QLB4,"This was a great series, the best adaptation yet and I doubt any will top this one.

The show is of course a tv series, so yes there's going to be some cheesy stuff going on when it comes to the action. Got to remember the budgets they have to work with. It's more of a drama than action series but there's enough action to satisfy those who love martial arts shows/movies of old (old Kung fu shows).

The second best version is the 1995 version with Loius Koo. Both the good versions are from Hong Kong. All the remakes of this movie from china sucks.

8142806,3,B000I0QLB4,"I ordered this edition of ""Return of the Condor Heroes"" from Asian Mall via Amazon. The version I received had different cover art, and only 5 DVDs in the box (which could hold 10 DVDs) although there are supposed to be 9 discs. All of the episodes were present, but more compressed.

I notified Customer Service, and they were very nice. I got a refund and reordered. They said I would get the 9 DVD version this time.

But Asian Mall shipped me the same 5 disc version the second time, too. The product is overpriced for 5 discs, and the video quality not quite satisfactory, so I sent it back again. Amazon Customer Service was again nice, but I would like to get the actual 9 DVD version (or one with even more discs) but cannot find it anywhere.

I ordered this edition of ""Return of the Condor Heroes"" after seeing it on YouTube and also seeing a 4 DVD version which I purchased from Ebay. Comparing the versions:

The version sold on this page (5 DVDs, claiming to be 9) has better video quality than the 4 disc version, but is comparable to the 360p YouTube download from anguyen3OO4Dramas (no longer there as of Nov 2013, but an identical version from ZzLeetzZ is still there) with English subtitles burned in, maybe just slightly better.

However, the version sold on this page has atrocious English subtitles, really horrible. Also, the default soundtrack is a Cantonese dub. To hear the actors actual voices, you have to select soundtrack 2 (Mandarin), or you will not be hearing the wonderful Crystal Liu Yifei (and others), but voiceovers. Also, the default subtitles are Chinese, so you have to select subtitle track 2 when you play each disc to get (crummy) English.

The 4 disc version, which was under $30, has better subtitles, but the video quality is not good.

The best version overall of the three I have seen is the one at YouTube, which costs nothing. The video is almost as good as these discs, and the subtitles are far better.

Regarding the content, Crystal Liu Yifei, only 18 when they were shooting this, is outstanding as Xiaolongn (Xiao Long Nu, Miss Long, Ms Dragon), and there are numerous other fine performances, notably Jessy Meng as Li Mo Cho and Yang Rui as Lu Wu Shuang. Huang Xiaoming as Yang Guo is good, but a bit annoying when overly agitated.

The production is good in general, mostly good directing, cinematography and editing. Some of the effects are a bit weak.

I find the writing to be atrocious, but I find most screen writing atrocious.

The bottom line: I would buy this again if I could get a high resolution version with good English subtitles. I give Crystal Liu Yifei 5 stars, the production 4 stars, the writing 1 star, and this DVD version 1 star. So, averaging, 3 stars.",1381276800,,2732,4.5893223819301845

8142808,4,B000I0QLB4,"This review is for the 2006 series.  I've seen this series numerous times and continue to find it enjoyable and overall a very faithful adaptation of the novel on which it is based.  Many scenes contain dialogue lifted directly from the book.  It's a very romantic tale reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet, and the series conveys that aspect well.  The acting and casting are good.  Huang Xiaoming and Liu Yifei have good chemistry as Yang Guo and Xiao Long Nu.  Liu Yifei is very good considering she was only 17 when this was produced. Other casting is also good, especially Wang Luoyong as Guo Jing and Kong Lin as Huang Rong. The costumes and sets are very attractive, and the action and fight scenes are well choreographed. It's hard to beat beautiful Jiuzhai Valley as a shooting location, although it's clearly very cold during much of the shoot and frequently raining, which makes me feel a lot of sympathy for the cast.

I have one complaint about the DVD set itself.  The set I received said 9 discs on the case and I paid a premium price, but the case only contained 5 discs, although those 5 discs did contain the complete series. I don't know if Tai Seng mislabeled the box or if there was some other problem going on.  Although I was hoping for a set with a slightly lower compression rate, the video and sound quality on the 5-disc set is good.

If you enjoy a mix of kung fu action, romance, and character development, this series is definitely worth a look.",1312675200,2,1470,4.513207547169811
