1434956,4,B00005JKJJ,"This is the only Chris Kattan movie I've seen so far, and I had alot trouble trying not to laugh.  It's a story about a family called the Romanos who also happened to be the mob.  The FBI has everyone on file:
-""Pops"" Romano, Father and the leader
-Paulie Romano, oldest son, good with a knife, and he can't read.
-Peter Romano, youngest son, the muscle in the family, and homosexual
-Leo Carrigan, Pop's right hand man.
The FBI has everthing they need to send the Romanos in the slammer but when Pops all have sudden gets sick, the FBI has to wait until he gets better.  The only way for the mob to get out of this mess is send somebody to pose as an FBI agent to get rid of the evidence that the FBI holds.  The only guy they have in mind is a family member who the FBI doesn't have on file, the family who really is Pop's youngest kid, the family member who didn't even know his family was the mob.  And that guy is Corky Romano.  But the only problem is, is that Corky happens to be a dork, there are times when he even acts like a kid, he never stands up for himself.  As Corky goes undercover as an FBI agent, he somehow accidently does stuff that makes him the #1 FBI guy.  He is being so famous in the FBI that he cannot seem to get enough time to steal the evidence against his family.  You""ll through all zany messes Corky goes through and what happens in the outcomes of these messes.  The movie is a little stupid but still good.  Get it.",1025308800,,1450,4.1063829787234045
1434957,4,B00005JKJJ,"Led by SNL funnyman Chris Kattan, Corky Romano is a hilarious movie that surpassed all expectations that I levied to it.  I did not have much hope for it since lately, whenever an SNL star goes off and does something on their own, it seems to be a total a complete failure that just humiliates themselves and the show to a maximum.
Well, Chris Kattan does a great job here.  He's fresh and quirky.  There are not many people in Hollywood that can pull of humor like this, and Kattan does a brilliant job.
The movie has a strong script with a strong supporting cast.  I didn't much care for Peter Falk's character, but everyone else was very well played.  There were many one-liners that caught you off guard.
I don't give it five stars because the film did take a long time to get going and at the end it kind of dropped off.  But, besides that, Corky Romano is one of the year's most surprising movies.  4 Stars",1022976000,,912,4.329411764705882
1434958,5,B00005JKJJ,"It's rare now a days to find a movie that's actually funny and not offensive. Corky Romono is definately a one of a kind, not only is it so funny you'll fall on the floor, but it's a movie one could watch with their mother, father or kids. Looking for an escape from reality for a couple of hours? Well watching this movie you'll be too busy laughing to even think about the outside world and it's problems! Chris Kattan is absolutely brilliant in his ""odd one out"" role of Corky the Vetrinarian turned FBI imposter! The entire cast sparkles with the funniest chemistry in a long time! I just can't say enough good things about this movie! I've seen it quite a few times already and made quite a few people watch it, and every single one, even the most cynical of people found it to be the funniest movied they had seen in a long time!",1022371200,2,835,4.291139240506329
1434959,4,B00005JKJJ,"I must say you will either love or hate this movie.  When I buy a DVD, I'm looking for a worthy movie, great picture and sound quality, and a bunch of extras.
The movie itself is very silly which translates to entertaining in my book.  Those who do not like SNL skits or are looking for some serious comedy may find this movie not to their liking.  If awkward situations and crude humour are to your tastes, this will fit the bill.
The picture on this DVD is wonderful.  The picture is very crisp and will make those who have digital TVs appreciate their purchase.  Sound quality is also top-notch.
Here's the downside: extras.  DVDs have become synonymous with extras.  This one disappoints.  Go to deleted scenes.  You will find two extended scenes that were cut short... and for good reason!  I found myself feeling a little jilted by the lack of extras on this disc.  It's for pure movie-watching only.
Overall, I loved the movie and would recommend it to any fan of slapstick comedy.  The DVD looks and sounds great, but it will leave you searching in vain for the ""DVD goodies"".  They weren't included.",1022198400,,1108,4.563451776649746
1434960,4,B00005JKJJ,"Corky Romano is a friendly but very clumsy assistant vetenarian, as his father and two brothers a mobsters and need someone to go undercover as a FBI agent to steal evidence to keep his father out of prison, so they pick Corky as no one will suspect him of being part of the Romano family.
With his FBI resume being so good as it says he can speak in different languages, a black belt, bravery awards, any way you get the hint. Everyone looks up to him to be a super agent. Corky knowing nothing at all manages to get everything write. This so called super agent who is named agent ""Pissant"" brings down some of the toughest gangs and Drug dealers and the way he does it is Hilarious.
It is all fun and laughs in this movie with some familiar actors, Chris Kattan (TV's SNL, Any Given Sunday), Vinessa Shaw (TV's Chicago Hope, Cop Land), Chris penn (Rush Hour, True Romance, Reservoir Dogs) & Fred Ward (Joe Dirt, Road Trip).
The movie will remind you of Blue Streak, but don't get me wrong its not like a rip off of it. From the Produces of ""Big Daddy"" & ""The Waterboy"" brings a Comedy that delivers and is a must see, although i suggest hire before buy, but either way you shouldnt be dissapionted.",1018224000,,1200,4.337777777777778

1435450,4,B00005JKJJ,"This movie is my guilty little secret. It's not a cinematic masterpiece, it's not some great cerebral experience. No, it's just an honestly funny movie.

From the first opening scene where Corky's driving his yellow convertible, I was laughing. I love that he's a member of this powerful mafia crime family, but that he just wants to be a veterinarian. It's one of those things that creates an automatic connection to the watcher... everyone wants to be brave enough to be their own person, even in the face of familial disapproval.

Anyways, Corky's father is under investigation by the FBI, but the rest of the family is too well known for them to go under cover and find out what the Feds know. So they call in Corky to be Agent Pissant, which he's happy to do because he loves his family and wants their love in return.

Hilarity ensues. There's a pretty girl. There's some slapstick moments that made me laugh until I cried a little. And basically, it's kind of a stupid movie that you can't help enjoying and wanting to see again.

If anyone asks, I watch things like ""The English Patient"" or ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" Really, though, ""Corky Romano"" is one of the few movies I always come back to in the end. It's my dirty little secret, but it always makes me happy.",1307404800,,1280,4.576419213973799
1435451,4,B00005JKJJ,"Genius has been defined as part inspiration and part perspiration.  In the case of Chris Kattan's performance in ""Corky Romano"" you can throw desperation into the mix. For better or for worse this is Kattan's baby and the fortunes of the film rise and fall with his work.  At times he can be manic and cloying and at other times he's brilliant and endearing.  It seems as though Kattan is somewhat overwhelmed by the fact that he's headlining a motion picture.  He might also be intimidated by having a talented supporting cast that includes legends like Peter Falk and Richard Roundtree and seasoned pros like Chris Penn and Peter Berg.  It was probably also daunting to have a love interest as uber-hot as Vinessa Shaw fresh from a plum role in Stanley Kubrick's final film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  The film also has plot holes you can drive a Mack truck through.  It's a stretch to think a doofus like Corky could infiltrate the FBI even in pre 9-11 days. It's a real suspension of belief when his comrades at the bureau mistake his foul-ups as part of some master plan.  Reality Alert!!!  This is a brainless comedy not ""Citizen Kane""!  ""Corky Romano"" works on it's owned skewed ragged terms snobs be damned.  It might be trite and it may be predicatable but by the end credits you'll find yourself smiling and even caring about these characters.  Kattan has some really amusing scenes.  I liked the scene where he tries to euthanize an obese cat.  The standout bit here though is one where he tries to wrangle a kilo of confiscated cocaine from a drug-sniffing dog and he gets smothered with white powder.  Afterwards he has to give a lecture to a group of second-graders while on a contact high.

I did that, but then again, there are a slew of SNL spin-off films that have carried their own weight or at least proved to be entertaining.  The problem I have with `Corky Romano' is that it just plain isn't funny; at all.  The premise is promising, in the vein of comedies of this nature, but it just doesn't deliver the goods as I had hoped it would.  I've never been a huge fan of Chris Kattan.  His breed of funny just doesn't work as well on him as it does on SNL castmate Will Ferrell.  Kattan tries too hard, and it shows.  Alas, some will like this and that is cool, but this comedy was NOT my cup of tea.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a gag or joke that lands just right; most of them flutter awkwardly to the floor.

1435454,4,B00005JKJJ,"Look, I heard the negative reviews about this movie and was skeptical about seeing it but Im glad I caved in and finally saw it because it was actually funny. Chris Kattan is a funny guy and should have gave him the benefit of the doubt that he could have made this movie work.

Corky Romano is a pet store owner(Chris Kattan) is sent to retrieve papers from the police office that could get his father ""Pops""(played by Peter Falk)indicted. He is mistaken for an FBI agent and is asked to be their go-to-guy and his quest to retrieve the evidence becomes more difficult.

Chris Kattan naturally gets all the laughs as the dopey but likable Corky. Outside of him you might get some laughs from Peter Falk and Richard Roundtree who plays a chief that really believes that Corky is a great FBI agent even though his ineptness shows. The scene where Corky gets a face full of coke and has to do a speech after wards is too funny for words. I had to take off a star because some of the jokes fall flat like the constant reminder that Paulie is gay or that Peter cant read but other than that this movie had me laughing most of the time.

It gives the cop going undercover a twist by a mobster family member going undercover as an FBI agent and the rest is all the silly stuff that would never occur in normal life, its worth a viewing.",1056412800,,531,4.145631067961165
1435525,3,B00005JKJJ,"In a movie that combines unintelligent comedy with the FBI, Chris Kattan gives a performance that you'll either love or hate.  Most popular for his roles on SNL (Mango, Mr. Peepers), Kattan might just wear out his welcome midway into the movie.  `Corky Romano' seemed to be a theater blockbuster back in 2001, though it is really nothing we haven't seen before.  The cast is pretty limited as Kattan is really the only one who shines; but Peter Falk and Chris Penn do allow for some good laughs in their supporting roles.  I was not very impressed with the film as a whole.  I found it to be reminiscent of a `Naked Gun' movie, but with more seriousness.  Playing the title character, Kattan fumbles around for 85 minutes of supposed-to-be comedy.  Some parts were hilarious, while others were down-right dumb.  Still, it's the few amusing parts that make this movie watch-able.
The story is based on the character of Corky, who is a forgotten son in a infamous mafia family.  When the family comes upon hard times, with their father (Peter Falk) set up for jail, they ask Corky to go undercover and steal the evidence that would convict him.  The entire script is weakly developed; as Corky, who is an assistant veterinarian, is allowed to become an FBI agent with, seemingly, no questions asked.  As I said, all Kattan does is fumble around and act stupid; while somehow becoming famous for solving cases and catching criminals.  Even with a dismal story and poor casting, Kattan does manage to bring some laughs to the screen.  His fake FBI name is Agent Pissante (it's French, but everyone likes to pronounce it pxss-ant).  The fact that one of his brothers is gay and the other can't read is also silly, but I did enjoy the part where Corky tried to compare his [gay] brother to Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.  As you probably know from watching Kattan on TV's Saturday Night Live, he brings his own blend of comedy to the screen.  That comedy is certainly an acquired taste, and it's very hard to attain a liking here. If you find his SNL characters Mr. Peepers or Mango to be stupid, you won't like this movie.  It almost seems like `Corky Romano' is aimed at teenage girls who smirk and snicker over anything.  In spite of everything bad I`ve said about this movie, it's still somewhat enjoyable.  If you like those `Dumb & Dumber' (but dumber) or SNL-type movies, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this one.
I gave this movie 3 stars because I think it was worth my time.  However, I probably won't watch it again (any time soon).  There were some good one-liners (i.e. the groovy tie club excerpt, the Matthew Perry poster, the ""we could all take a page out of Pissante's book"" quote), but overall the humor was rather one-dimensional.  The music put the movie was also daft and clich; ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" was playing when the family comes to rescue Corky.  I don't know if there's a soundtrack, but if there is don't buy it.  As for the ending, I think it was fitting.  I won't ruin it for you.  Anyways, `Corky Romano' is not all it's cracked up to be.  It's a bad twist on FBI-related films and not as good as `A Night At The Roxbury' or even the `Naked Gun' series.  This film is the epitome of helpless, slapstick comedy and is definitely not for everyone.  SNL fans will probably enjoy it, but if you flip the channel when Mango appears, you'll almost certainly dislike this movie.",1049673600,,3405,4.581818181818182
1435526,3,B00005JKJJ,"If you don't like Chris Kattan, you shouldn't even be reading this.  If you like Chris Kattan, you will probably like this movie.  Chris is perky, energetic, adorable, and rather silly in this movie ... everything you'd expect from him really.  The plot is better than most would probably like to admit.  Yet, this movie still is not a stand-out.  Perhaps it's too perky, energetic, etc.  I can't put my finger on what was missing or what was saturating in this movie that prevented it from being a great comedy, but it just wasn't.  But again, it wasn't bad either -- worth a watch or a rental, but maybe not a purchase.
As you've probably deduced from the previews, Chris' character is a bubbly and likeable, albeit clutzy, veterinarian who happens to be part of a mob family.  This is the obvious irony and source of most of the humor in the movie.  Chris feigns FBI agent for most of the movie, which is as funny as it is unbelievable.  There is the mandatory love interest who is also an FBI agent.  And Chris of course learns a thing or two along the way.  There's nothing particularly shocking or innovative in this movie but it does generally do its job -- it makes you laugh ... or at least chuckle.",1035331200,,1208,4.4409090909090905

Corky Romano is like rewinding your dvd's. It serves no purpose, and its embarassing. Jerry Lewis covered everything in this movie, with more talent, and skill, decades ago.
The Plot, if I dare mention the word: a single bafoon, with a counterfiet piece of paper and a suit, announcing that he is tapped (and high, and along the way teaches a kiddie class...also high) infiltrates the F.B.I. in a matter of minutes - Its amazing what your cliche' hacker can get you from his basement when you give him a good threat and a slap in the head. Im guilty of liking goofy movies... the ""Bill and Teds"" are among them, but as a friend, which I hope you consider me to be...don't see this junk. It's a mistake, it stinks.

The movie is about the Romano family being betrayed by a hidden FBI informent,so they decide to send a family member to erase all of the evidence. They had to send Corky Romano(Chris Katten) because he's the only family member that the FBI won't recognize. Corky's silly attitude accidentally made him becomes a star after going undercover.

The fact is ""Corky Romano"" is so awful that it is a kind of perverse fun for non-Kattan devotees.  It is about a guy ""Corky"" Romano, a vet, who happens to have once been a member in a mob family, but now is kicked out of the circle because he is too unsuitable for the family business.  But as now they need a guy who has to be an undercover FBI agent (!) for some reason I forgot, they recruit him again and dress him up with FBI uniform.  But he is so terribly inept that nobody realizes his true identity; instead, they think he is a first-rate investigator who has his own method of cracking a case.
The premise is funny, and it kind of worked in such films like ""Blue Streak,"" but in ""Romano"" Chris Kattan is reduced to very limited capacity of making laughs: worst kind of slapsticks -- he is always wiggling his arms, screaming and sniveling, for more than 1 hour.  If this is not a film about Shakespeare, it doesn't mean that the film needs no character or reasonable situations because the movie is, unlike sketches of TV program, a piece of work through which audience must sit in the dark.  But if you get a DVD, then it's alright.  Just stop whereever you want.  Even though the gags are all unimaginative and too predictable.
If this film stopped there ... but the film commits a great crime in casting veterans like Peter Falk and Richard Roundtree, whose names should be much more respected here.  Falk, fondly remembered as Columbo, plays the boss of the mob, but isn't allowed to do nothing; and the hero of 70s blaxploitation films Roundtree is made to praise Romano character every time he commits stupidity (like his brandishing a firing machine-gun in a crime scene) so that great Shaft looks like a real fool.  This is atrocious.
Again I say, ""Corky Romano"" is, like ""A Night at the Roxbury,"" for those who love Chris Kattan.  If you're not one of them, stay away.",1026000000,2,2052,4.387862796833773

Peter Falk must be short on cash, for I can't imagine why a distinuished actor like him would involve himself in a clunker like this one. The characters are completely void of any depth or interest, the adolescent references to farting and burping got old in the first five minutes, the stereotypes are trite and unimaginative, and the story line is, of course, as trite and ridicululous as the rest of the movie. The acting is uneven, the editing is horrible, and even the sound was bad. The one and only redeeming feature of this film is, of course, Chris Kattan.  Like Robin Williams of a generation ago, he can make almost any scene funny with his facial expressions and body language, and he was worth the 99 cents we paid for the DVD rental.  If anyone else, including maybe even Robin Williams, would have played Corky, this would have been THE WORST film of the year. As it is, it is only one of the worst.",1026000000,3,1096,4.47
