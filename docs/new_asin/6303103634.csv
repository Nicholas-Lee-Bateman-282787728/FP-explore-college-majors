7838353,3,6303103634,"Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm, 1951 film

This is set in Cape Flattery in Washington State. A horse-drawn wagon proceeds to Billy Reeds store. Pa tests his pipe tobacco. Toms wife Kim is due to give birth and goes to the hospital. So  too Pa Kettle. Mistaken identity? Is he out of place? [Note the rope to hold up his pants.] Just like shelling peas. Back home the family dines. A telegram arrives, there will be visitors: Kims parents. What name for the baby boy? [There is conflict that pads out the story.] Dinner is served. The next day school starts for the children. Jonathan visits the old farm and sees the hen-house. He used to be a mining engineer. Elizabeth hands out surgical masks for hygiene. Miss Quimby gives the orders. Outside local Indians arrive to greet the little white chief. Elizabeth tells of her plans! There is in-law problems now.

Ma Kettle discusses her decisions. Shut her up? The Kettles decide to return to their old house. How peaceful. Pa will fix things as soon as he can borrow the nails. Ma has a unique way to make orange juice! Did Pa say work? They will dig a new well. Two visitors ask about buying their place. [They are prospectors.] They dig the well! How did Pa make that fan run? A human dynamo? Pa has acquired a strange power. I cant believe it! Mr. Parker explains the source of this power. The government will pay a lot of money for his ore. Billy Reed suggests incorporation and has the papers handy. Pa uses a blackboard for calculation. [Was this taken from Abbott & Costello?] Tom Kettle arrives with bad news. Will Kim and her baby go to Boston? Billy Reed arrives with a baby. A mistake? So too Geoduck and Crowbar! How to tell them apart? The Sheriff arrives to search for the stolen babies. They are in the back seat! We all make mistakes sometimes.

Can the Kettles lose their land due to unpaid taxes? Can Mr. Parker but it back? Is there uranium ore on this land? Mr. Parker argues for the Kettles to wind back their land. [Legal technicalities?] Can they celebrate? The search reveals old coveralls, navy surplus. Tom arrives to tell Kim, her son, and her mother are leaving! What can they do? Kettle drives to the train station. [A car chase is good for action. Note the long shots for stunt doubles.] Pa stops the train. [Dont try this at home!] Jonathan Parker argues for the Kettles again. Ma talks to Lizzie, but the train leaves. Ma used to have an hourglass figure but the sands shifted. They return home for a happy ending [for now].

A good story makes a good movie. This is somewhat below average, like a run-of-the-mill TV comedy episode. Jokes tacked on to the story get laughs but suggest the episodes were stitched together. It does subtly warn about the effects of the radiation from a nuclear explosion.",1504656000,,2787,4.5108910891089105

7838360,3,6303103634,"The Kettle story began with the film THE EGG AND I (1947). They had a small part in the film, but was asked to star in their own film series, MA AND PA KETTLE (1949) and then MA AND PA KETTLE GO TO TOWN (1950).  In this fourth film, Pa goes into town with his two Indian friends to get on the nerves of Mr. Reed, the gemeral store owner.  What Pa doesn't know is, is that he is about to become a grandfather.  Pa gets confused and thinks his wife is about to have another child.  Like they have 15 already.  Actually, it's Richard Long that is the new daddy.  The Kettles are finally settled in their new modern house they had won in that contest, but upon the sudden visit of the new grandson's other grandparents, the Parkers, who are well-to-do, the whole house is re-arranged by the new guests.  But soon the Parkers are about to see how the Kettles really live.  Since the house is too big or should I say too crowded for the daughter-in-law and her parents, the Kettles decide to go back to the old farm.  If the man who plays ""Steve"" looks familar, it is Jerry Hausner who went on to play ""Jerry--the Agent"" in the ""I Love Lucy"" pilot.  Then Jerry/Joe and did ""Baby Crying"" in the CBS ""I Love Lucy"" tv series.",1083196800,4,1216,4.202586206896552
7838361,5,6303103634,I think this movie is one of their best.  It brings tears of laughter to your eyes.  Movies that make you smile and feel good are the best and this one is on top of the list of great family films.  I think you will enjoy this movie and feel good for the rest of the day after watching Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm.,998352000,11,319,3.7313432835820897
7838362,3,6303103634,"In this installment of the Kettle series, Ma and Pa become grandparents when their son, Tom, and his wife, Kim, become parents themselves.  Kim's parents arrive from Boston to help out with the baby, and tensions rise  between the grandmothers.  The end result--Ma and Pa leave the start of art  modern home to return to the squalor of the squattors flat.  Included is  the standard screwball humor, and the introduction of Kim's parents is  important as background for Ma and Pa Kettle On Vacation (an essential  film).  However, for Kettle films, this one falls squarely in the middle.  It is a good film, not quite as good as the first 3 (including The Egg and  I), better than  At the Fair, In the Ozarks, or Old McDonalds Farm.",962409600,14,732,4.6328125
