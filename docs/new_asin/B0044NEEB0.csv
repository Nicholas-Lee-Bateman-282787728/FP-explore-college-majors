8416245,1,B0044NEEB0,It was in Spanish. I had no idea. Totally worthless. Didn't know I needed to watch for region 2 or any other identifier for Spanish.,1494288000,,132,4.32
8416246,1,B0044NEEB0,"***Spoilers Ahead, Maybe*** I mainly watched this movie because I was flipping through the movie channels looking for something to watch & I was lucky enough to catch it right when it started. The only time anything really happens in Cattle Drive is when what really happened when John Cord & his men shot up the town is revealed & the foiled ambush/shootout at the end. Those were the most exciting things to happen in the movie. Oh yeah, and when John Cord is dragged through town at the beginning. Nothing really happens in Cattle Drive except a...... cattle drive. Cattle Drive was boring at times but it's not a bad enough movie that I'd turn it off before it ended. It's definitely not a movie I'd recommend somebody go see even if you're a Western fan like I am. There are better Westerns or even better movies out there you could be watching",1471651200,,849,4.51948051948052
8416247,5,B0044NEEB0,"I really enjoyed this western starring Joel McCrea he is a legend actor in western movies
i have watched many of his movies this would have to rate along with the many he starred in
Having a multi -zone for this [Region 2] is a must it is well worth watching.",1372896000,2,259,4.098039215686274
