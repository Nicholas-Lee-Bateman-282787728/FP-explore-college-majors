8509532,5,B0073XF07K,"I have been watching a lot of Vietnam war documentaries and this is definitely one of my favorites. It's four dvd's. The first one is a bit slow but if you stick it out the rest are very good, especially the last one which I considered excellent. Great vintage film, good interviews and very good narration. Worth buying.",1470873600,2,321,4.551724137931035
