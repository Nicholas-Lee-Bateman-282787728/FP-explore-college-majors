though.
I've got all six of THESE, and all of the GOOSEBUMPS DVDs as well.
Another [companion] recent release is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/R-L-Stine-s-The-Haunting-Hour-The-Series-Vol-5/dp/B00D7AM6QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Vol. 5</a>

All of the GOOSEBUMPS collections are being combined, and are, now, mostly on 2009-2012 releases. Cannot recall any for 2013, so I'm
looking forward to new collections in 2014.

Very HIGHLY recommended for children of ages 6 to 96. If you can SEE it... you'll LIKE it.

5776311,2,B00D7AM64I,"this is the last dvd they put out for the haunting our and i hope it is the last cuz after these eps, there aren't anymore good ones. season 2-4 aren't good at all. they start off scary but end flat and have way too many teen issues and life stuff. Episode include: Creature Feature, Part 1, Creature Feature, Part 2, Brush With Madness, Sick, and Mascot.  creature feature is a pretty good ep.  part 2 is better than part 1. its a kid who loves old school drive in movies, mostly horror. somehow he is sucked into the movie and gets bit or experimented on  when he comes out he slowly turns into a human size bug monster. he is later cured when he goes back into the movie. brush with madness is pretty good and creepy. acting is pretty good and so is the story. pretty much a comic geek takes the brushes of his fav artist and he is compelled to just paint but for some reason he paints a man stalking his house. sick and mascot r just terrible that is when the series in the 2nd season started to get really bad. the plot lines make no sense and just aren't good at all.",1414886400,,1073,4.124401913875598

5776318,5,B00D7AM64I,"Great series for kids just getting into the horror genre.  I posted a review of another season and this one is no different.  The imagery is absurd enough to be make believe but cautious enough to keep the kids interested.  I do caution parents to pay attention to the movie disclaimer at the beginning of some episodes that says ""not for children under 7"".  They mean it.  Watched with my 8 year old in my lap and peeking out from a blanket.  LOL",1392940800,2,447,4.325301204819277

8590257,5,B00D7AM64I,"Awsome series fpr kids ans adults alike.
Bought the entire collection and got hooked instantly! I'm an adult and don't have kids but a true Sci-fi/Horror fan. Liked GOOSEBUMPS BUT THIS IS WAY BETTER as far as fear factor. I'd be a little concerned having a child under 10 watch alone. It at times dose get intense and the main characters often suffer in ill fated demise. I recommend the series.",1493942400,,395,4.577464788732394
