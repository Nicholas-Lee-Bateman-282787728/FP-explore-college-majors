8516277,5,B0010SLTO2,"I love learning about the behind the scenes stuff about Pirates of the Caribbean, but the two-disc edition of the third one doesn't include all of the special features. That's why I bought this- because it has a lot of extra stuff, like how they filmed the ""Multiple Jacks"" scene, an interview with both Johnny Depp and Keith Richards (who plays Teague Sparrow, Jack's father in Pirates 3), how they filmed the underwater scene, and lots more! I recommend this extra disc (which you can only get at Best Buy or by chance on amazon or ebay) for any hardcore Pirates of the Caribbean 3 fan.",1201392000,11,588,4.556603773584905
