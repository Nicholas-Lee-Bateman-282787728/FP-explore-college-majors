8002457,2,B0000T71IU,Very disappointing was hoping for more historic footage and less hot-dogging. should have paid more attention to the previous review.,1471910400,,133,5.7
8002458,5,B0000T71IU,This film is where it all starts. At least for me it was the first tele flick I saw several years ago. Although older it totally captures the vibe and as I watch it again still make s me want to do no other ski/board other than tele. So here's to Sondre and The fine country of Norway. Skal !!,1391126400,,293,3.9
8002459,1,B0000T71IU,Reading the other reviews makes me wonder if I actually received the correct dvd.  I cannot check it because I was so dissatisfied I threw the dvd out after one viewing.  The disc I had only showed a bunch of hot-doggers jumping off of mountain cliffs over a hip-hop or rap sound track.  Boring.,1386460800,,295,4.425925925925926
8002460,5,B0000T71IU,"For anyone who wants to do the hardest thing on the mountain. They need to watch this!! Alpine, Snow skates, and Boarders can't hold a candle to the Skiers in this film. No mater who you are or what you do if you enjoy the snow or so called ""extreem sports"" you will enjoy this film.",1008547200,,283,4.071428571428571
8002461,5,B0000T71IU,A film for every skier.  If you freeheel or want to know what it's all about this is definitely one for your archives.,977875200,4,118,4.130434782608695
