8243532,3,B001221DW4,"For the price, THE GOLDEN AGE OF MUSICALS is a good deal, if only for the variety of selections.  Some of the titles are fairly well-known to fans of movie musicals, but the more obscure films are really what makes this collection worth obtaining.  A note:  at least two of the musicals can only be placed in that genre by the greatest stretch of the imagination, although they both involve music.  Overall the film quality is good, much better than one finds in similarly priced re-issue packs, but don't expect pristine copies.",1228348800,9,529,4.717391304347826
