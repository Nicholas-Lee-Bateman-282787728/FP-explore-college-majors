7489304,2,B017612EQI,wasn't I don't like it. I didn't get what I paid for. I got one dvd for $106.00!!! No thanks. I sent it back and Amazon credited my acct back in about two working days.

7489305,3,B017612EQI,"The item was as described, however I was very disappointed with the return policy, which I had failed to read prior to purchase.  I received only 50% of the purchase price as a refund when the item was returned as recipient did not appreciate the DVD set. The original cellophane wrapper had been removed, thus the decrease in refund.",1453248000,5,334,4.661016949152542
7489306,1,B017612EQI,"Was disappointed because I was expecting 8 DVD's and only received 1 with 6 shows recorded. Not sure if I will get the others, if so I will keep this one, if not I'll return it.
I did get Roy Clark and enjoyed it very much.",1451260800,3,223,3.869565217391304
7489307,5,B017612EQI,"As a young child, I used to watch Hee Haw with my family because there really wasn't anything else on. Remember, there was no cable.........Sometimes, I admit, watching without the best attitude, because Hee Haw was of course...NOT cool!!! But always, laughing with the whole family and enjoying the great musical performances. Even after all of these years...........these corny, clean jokes are VERY funny. It is nice to revisit them myself and to introduce them to another, younger generation, my daughter! It is also nice for her to see that there are ways to be funny that aren't making fun of others, or being nasty....I wish some Hollywood producers would take the hint. It takes more creativity to be family oriented than to be vulgar and crude.",1451260800,3,753,4.937007874015748
7489308,5,B017612EQI,"Love this show. the dvds are great!

7489309,5,B017612EQI,"this show was a favorite of mine as a child. I remember watching it with my parents, and it was a great bonding experience.  I purchased this as a gift for my mother, my father has passed away. She cried when she opened it. She said it was one of her favorite memories. We live a few states apart, and she says it helps her feel that we are closer.  The disks were in perfect shape, no skipping or issues.  I highly recommend this, especially if you watched it as a kid!

disclosure: I received this product at a significant discount in exchange for an honest review.  I may purchase a second set at full price for my grandpa.",1449360000,3,626,4.226890756302521

8738110,5,B017612EQI,Bought this for my 91 year old father who recalls the show and loved it. He truly enjoys going back in time to watch these old favorites. I recommend it for anyone who remembers and enjoyed this show.,1474934400,2,200,4.2894736842105265
8738111,2,B017612EQI,"Was so excited about getting these DVD's. Love Hee Haw! Got them and literally every DVD has a place that freezes and/or skips. Also there is a DVD missing. I just noticed this as I prepared them to be returned. Where ever Amazon is getting them, they need to address these issues. If DVD's all play right and are intact, I would LOVE to reorder them. I badly want the whole series. Very disappointed...  :(",1465603200,6,407,4.426666666666667

8738114,3,B017612EQI,"I purchased this for my parents and they instantly started laughing when it was placed in the DVD player.  However, the next day after watching for two hours they said that there were a lot of repeated skits.  Why would they do this?",1456531200,13,233,4.395348837209302
8738115,4,B017612EQI,"I see all these other reviews where people said, ""they received this set at a discount rate because of their honest review""... hmmmmm?  I wonder HOW DOES ONE GET THIS BONUS?  Anyways... whatever... I bought this set (8) for full price and wished it wasn't so expensive. But, as a kid, I loved Hee Haw and the FAMILY TIME spent together watching it every Saturday night!  We only had 2 tv channels then and Dad didn't like whatever was on the other channel then so we got to watch this. I grew up in the country and really liked this show in spite of it's ""corniness"".  I, now, see there is an even bigger set and wish I had seen it but I would NOT have paid over $200 for it. AS it was, I was having to try and justify the $116 I paid for this one! We have a huge dvd/video library and this is a welcome addition to our library.  I laughed at the stupidness of some of the skits/jokes... thoroughly ENJOYED being told the story of ""Rindercella"" again as a woman in my 60's, now!... found MYSELF exclaiming, ""oh oh!"" when Grampa broke his banjo string... remarked, ""OMG how YOUNG they were! (at various stars who are now senior citizens or gone...)... I remembered all the songs and punchlines... and I marveled at how Roy Clark could make music! All-in-all I enjoyed the dvds but there was 1 problem... The discs froze for a few seconds after many performances ... I figure they were taped from tv and that is where the commercials were taken out.  After a while I got used to it but I wish the quality was better.  These are videos we will watch many times because they are good, clean, fun... not a bunch of blow 'em up/drugs/smut/killings/bad language (you know... modern day tv shows) and they are light (nothing serious goin' on!)... you can listen while doing something else, for example while watching them, which we often do. I wish I had the bigger set... there is much I remember that was NOT on this collection...",1456185600,16,1924,4.402816901408451
