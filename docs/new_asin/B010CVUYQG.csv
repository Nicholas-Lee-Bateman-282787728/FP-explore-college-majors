8722082,3,B010CVUYQG,Strange movie based (and condensed from) Dennis Potter's tv series starring Bob Hoskins. More sexual than the series. Robert Downey Jr. Stars as a detective hospitalized with a rare skin disease. Or is he a detective? I haven't fiqured it out yet. Still don't know if i really liked this movie,1494201600,,293,4.764705882352941
