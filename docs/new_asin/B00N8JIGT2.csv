6613418,5,B00N8JIGT2,"Saw this movie in the theater last year. Everyone from the kids to the adults were laughing through the whole movie. After the movie, I was speaking to the manager. He said you could hear our laughter in the lobby If you like comedy, Christmas movies or Madea, this is a must have! One of my top favorite Madea's.",1415577600,20,313,4.322033898305085

6613420,5,B00N8JIGT2,"Tyler Perry is an amazing man he knows how to act, direct and produce. This movie was by far the funniest Madea yet! Tyler Perry defiantly knows how to put actors together that can make you laugh for the entire movie.",1414108800,23,217,4.317073170731708
6613421,4,B00N8JIGT2,"Tyler Perry is a very interesting person. He gives Tommy Wiseau a run for his money. In pretty much all his movies, there is random sub-plot drama that I love to make fun of. There is always some woman in an abusive relationship or trying to better herself, up to a family member slowly dying from a disease. Personally, I just wish he'd stick directly on the Madea character. She's the main star that everyone wants to see. That's what was great about her last outing, Witness Protection. It was basically focused on her and dealing with Eugene Levy's family.

A Madea Christmas kinda returns to the basics with a little family drama, but not overkill. It was the right amount of drama and the right amount of Madea. It's filled with good comedy, cheesy but funny one- liners, good messages, and should hopefully put you in the Christmas spirit.

Madea is working part-time at a department store for the holidays with her friend, Eileen. Eileen is depressed because her daughter, Lacey won't be able to make it home for Christmas. Eileen asks a reluctant Madea to help drive her out to Alabama to Lacey's for Christmas. Lacey is startled because she has not told her mom that she has married a white man named Conner. Lacey soon has to deal with in-laws, keeping secrets from her mom and trying to get the Christmas Jubilee to keep its religious tone. If you love Madea and Christmas movies, I highly recommend A MADEA CHRISTMAS!!!",1412294400,70,1432,4.6561264822134385

6613423,5,B00N8JIGT2,"I recommend this to every Madea/Tyler Perry fan and even to people that's never seen a Madea/Tyler Perry film. It was absolutely the most hilarious film I've seen this year besides ""We're the Millers"" and the funniest in the Madea series. I'm a big Madea/Tyler Perry fan and it made me laugh till I was in tears, it touched my heart in certain scenes and I can relate to each character in the film. The story was superb, the acting was great and it's a great feel good film. Tyler Perry hit it out of the ball park once again as Madea and I can't wait for his future projects ahead! I HIGHLY recommend everyone to go see it even if it's after Christmas! Great job once again and God bless to you Tyler Perry. Can't wait to buy it on DVD to add to my collection!",1388361600,53,761,4.183673469387755

6613472,5,B00N8JIGT2,"I love Tyler Perry's Medea series of movies. They are what they are--light hearted stuff with enough serious and comedy and they do not take themselves seriously. This movie was funny in that it is a ""switch"" in understanding and race. I am black and I loved this as I know people who ""act"" like the character's in this movie. Medea is 'nuts' as usual. Tired of the holiday football games, stuffed, just want to NOT think and smile--this is the movie---Now--if this were Halloween, I'd say let's talk about Medea's Halloween--BOO---BaHa!
But, it is the holiday season--sit back and enjoy this one--don't think, don't worry about the plot, etc--just open your mind and relax and laugh.  Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Happy New Year",1513468800,,733,4.911290322580645

6613774,5,B00N8JIGT2,"After spending the early afternoon engrossed in Parton's seminal work, A Smokey Mountain Christmas, my partner and I decided to travel further down the rabbit hole of Christmas movies and stumbled upon, quite by accident, this masterpiece of cinema.  Like Fellini's 8 1/2, I was never quite sure if the events in the movie were set in the real world or in some parallel dimension where things are just slightly off.  This is even more obvious with Madea herself who has the gift of evoking a kind of waking dream quite spontaneously as if it were taking place rightoutside her own consciousness.  Why did a poinsettia farmer have so much influence with the mayor who apparently had the authority to fire a school teacher and why was the school seemingly in the same building with the courthouse?  It may have been enough to flip gender and race, but when vehicles flipped without warning, it was a brilliant mess.  My only regret is that I did not have director commentary for this.",1477958400,2,982,4.719298245614035

Eileen seems like the nice one, everybody loves her, compared to her friend/relative Madea. But then it becomes clear that, while Madea cuts right to the loud, overbearing, and sometimes outright rude truth, Eileen lies  and manipulates her daughter with HER version of the truth. In the end though, she's forced to see that her daughter has her own life. Madea is impossible, Eileen is worse, and the daughter loves them all no matter what!",1468540800,,559,4.822916666666667

6615409,4,B00N8JIGT2,"I like the movie but its not my favorite Madea or even Tyler Perry film. I can see how some parts feel a little forced or even unnecessary. I think that all of the lead characters were casted correctly but some of the supporting and even minor roles definitely feel out of place and unrealistic. Granted it is fiction but the story doesn't seem believable and while I appreciate the reverse roles of racism and the dialogue it brings, the back story of them all coming together to save the town's Christmas Jubilee just doesn't seem like the most plausible story. And all in all, it just lacks the spark that some of the Madea series early stories bring. I like it for the humor of Perry and Larry the Cable Guy and for the potential of the plot but could never love it because it doesn't have the spark that should be present with Perry being such a blockbuster within movie and television.",1457222400,,891,4.439024390243903

6615553,1,B00N8JIGT2,"This is easily the worst of all the Madea movies. Whereas the others are funny and only have subtle religious references, this one goes way overboard with implying that Christmas is purely a Christian holiday. There's very little humor in this movie, and Madea's character somehow manages to get plenty of camera time while only feeling like a guest star in this movie.

It's missing most of the attitude and character that you likely enjoyed in the other Madea movies. I strongly suggest avoiding this one unless you enjoy being disappointed.",1454976000,,543,4.967032967032967

6615587,4,B00N8JIGT2,This is one of my favorite Madea Movies. There is enough humor for the grown ups and even the older kids in the house.

6615590,5,B00N8JIGT2,"Of all the Madea movies, this is the one that strikes just the right balance between comedy and drama. If this is your first Madea movie, I would recommend not bothering with the rest of them. The serious subjects are too serious in Madea's other movies, and the comedy scenes and quips are few and far between. This one has plenty of Madea with a subject of reverse racism that was not played too heavily at all. You know what's going to happen in the first 10 minutes, but that's not the point. You're there to laugh at Madea and shake your head at the petty bickering during the holidays. This movie became an instant Christmas classic for me, and if you can get past the other Madea movie flops, you might just enjoy this one. As for other Madea movies, others have recommended watching the plays on DVD rather than the actual movie versions. I haven't tried them yet, but I'll give one or two a chance. As for A Madea Christmas, I wish she would come see MY family for the holidays!",1454716800,2,987,4.369565217391305

I was given a bonus surprise when Larry the Cable Guy showed up!  I didn't know he was in it, and he fit right in.  The movie is tastefully done and I'm looking forward to watching it again next Christmas.

Tyler Perry discusses the topics of discrimination and people's opinions of others of different races. It is done though in a sensitive and caring manner. It is a welcome edition in my opinion to my collection of Christmas movies.

Watched w Amazon prime and really will consider purchasing the DVD.

The customers there aren't ready for Madea and her honest truths.  She takes a trip with her niece...at least I think she's her niece to see the woman's daughter.  I love the way Madea sets her daughter straight about her mother and all the lies her mother has told her.  It has a love story, lies, a young boy who needs help to stand up for himself, a town and of course a big bad cooperation.  It is a good movie for Christmas.  Makes you laugh and feel all tingly with the love.",1451606400,,597,4.042735042735043

I suspect this movie would make you laugh out loud even if you were in a bad mood.

Tyler Perry, when he keeps to the Madea ""basics"" is a scream.  But this time, he figured out how to get a message across without preaching in any way.  Larry the Cable guy provides another comedic approach that, believe it or not, compliments TP -- I keep seeing new parts of this movie every time I watch it.

This may well be what, today, is low-brow, but it is engaging, thought provoking and most of all FUNNY.",1450828800,,582,4.106194690265487

6616013,5,B00N8JIGT2,"A Madea Christmas the Movie is classic Madea cutting up and getting everyone in order during the Christmas season. Madea gets employed at a department store and of course things do not work out. She ends up going with her niece (Ilene) to visit her great niece (Lacey) in the country on her farm. Her great niece is living their with a gentleman (Tanner) who she happens to be married. The story continues on with both sides of their (Lacey and Tanner's) families coming together. SPOILER ALERT: My family and I hollered when Madea used one of the students for Jesus on the cross. We had to pause the movie we were laughing so hard. Another favorite scene is the adventure of Madea going to visit her niece's. The entire journey is hilarious. From the KKK scene to the ""Somebody has to be an activist. Somebody's got to call Sharpton"" scene. Great moments!",1449532800,,856,4.601307189542483

We love the character of Madea - she's in your face but right on with the important things. I'm sorry she's considered a negative stereotype to some, but I think her combination of street smarts, and practical good sense (ok, it's mixed with lots of nuttiness) make her a rocking character. We want more Madea. I especially liked that this movie wasn't formulaic as some of Tyler Perry's earlier ones were.",1449446400,,503,4.6

Perry movies, even the sound was of more poor quality and the acting was way off and very unrealistic even for a fictional story thats supposed to be entertaining. Couple stars because I was disappointed since other T. Perry movies were so good so I know this was capable but it missed the mark for me.

6616168,5,B00N8JIGT2,"This guy's films are always enjoyable for the gentleness of the stories and the humor.  Serious themes are explored and serious things happen, but the overall vibe retains a classic old-school American cinema quality.  The characters fit certain iconic personality types, but each has something quirky or different enough to keep them from seeming cliched or too predictable.  This has a great cast with excellent chemistry between them.  Everything feels very natural even though the story is presented in a stylized way, with a lot of events and issues taking place quickly.  I particularly liked the exploration of the issue of Christianity in Christmas celebrations and displays, a timely topic of freedom of religion and free speech in our nation.  The film in a sense uses a feather to strike a heavy blow against negating the religious ideals that many people wish to be free to make during the Christmas season.",1449014400,,919,5.052980132450331

6616519,1,B00N8JIGT2,Tyler perry's movies are extremely lame!!!  I can't even believe he makes what he does off the past movies he has made or any for that matter. all of his movies are childish but a child shouldn't watch them because the adult language and sexual content at times. So it takes a mentally immature person with a low IQ to like a Tyler perry film. That's my opinion and I'm being completely honest.,1447286400,,394,4.397260273972603

6616549,5,B00N8JIGT2,"I think that Tyler Perry is the most slighted actor in history. Seriously, watch this film - the depth of the character Madea - is there less depth here then Forrest Gump? Occasionally Madea will let out some pain only slightly as if thinking deep into her own history. The academy should stop overlooking comedy for starters - and second why is Madea considered non-intelligent art while Forrest Gump is Oscar worthy.

I love every one of these movies.",1446940800,,453,4.734177215189874

6616562,4,B00N8JIGT2,I like the comedy side of this movie but Madea or Tyler Perry lets a good bit of curse words fly throughout it. This is why I didn't give it five stars. It talks about not leaving Christ out of Christmas which is a great thing but the language (curse words and such) does not match and go together.,1446854400,,298,4.067796610169491

Both of them still have their chops and did a great job. I thought Chad Michael Murray brought great depth to his character Tanner. He got a lot of the emotions just right. Unfortunately I am not a fan of Tika Sumpter. Her acting comes across as either forced or flat.

6616895,3,B00N8JIGT2,"First of all, I love the character Madea, but this time she was a little too schizoid at the beginning. I think most of the time she is hilarious.  These movies are always a bit weird in the manner they preach about some issues, but I overlook b/c I like the character. They also have a crazy quilt of sometimes unnecessary characters and side storylines, which seem a waste of time. However, most importantly I wasn't too thrilled about the over the top Christ in Christmas stuff and a bit concerned who the construction company owner's religious denomination(if any) was, because that was a rather off-putting and hopefully not anti-Semitic.",1441411200,,643,4.845454545454546

6616923,3,B00N8JIGT2,"Sometimes, I just don't know how I go there with Tyler Perry's Madea...and sometimes I just stop thinking and keep laughing. The Negative: always about 20X too much toilet humor for me. Guess they keep that huge percentage in for the 8-year olds, right? The Super Positive: what I adore in Madea/Tyler Perry's trick bag is the changeup and total flipping of archetypes and stereotypes.

And if you ever had a frothing-at-the-mouth Killah Tiger Mom, no matter your race, ethnic heritage, you'll FREAKIN' WISH it was as easy to changeup a mean mom's decades of family torture as it is in about 70 minutes in this fun holiday film.

6617591,3,B00N8JIGT2,"Unfortunately, it seems Tyler Perry attempted to reach too many different groups with the movie and missed.  There are many instances of sexual innuendos and lewd comments.  The outline for the movie provided a tremendous base, but the movie didn't deliver.  The movie is based on a daughter who left her busy home town for a quieter life in the south on a farm and a teacher in a small town school strapped for money.

I would give it a two star except there are a few redeeming parts - it isn't a movie I would recommend for 'kids' under 17. Too many sexual remarks -",1433808000,3,569,4.339622641509434

The storyline involving the jubilee/sponsors was a bit too obvious- you knew where it was headed- and kind of formulaic... having seen other Madea movies, it was no surprise.  But I'm watching for the lines Madea throws out, not for plot. In all, a positive and heartwarming movie with plenty of laughs, despite a predictable plot and some overacting by Anna Maria Horsford (seemed she was still in sitcom mode, from her ""Amen"" days).",1433548800,,614,4.884615384615385

6618074,2,B00N8JIGT2,"Madea is a great character.  I really liked Witness Protection Program, but this movie is very hard to enjoy until about halfway through.  The first half portrays Madea as a completely crazy, lazy, idiot.  Part of what I've always liked about the character Madea is her down-to-earth wisdom.  But she is just crazy and stupid for most of this movie.  The movie gets better, though as it goes on.  You can pretty much skip the first 50 minutes and then enjoy a short, fairly-funny show for the remaining time.",1425859200,,508,4.651685393258427

6618119,1,B00N8JIGT2,"We all know that Tyler Perry (not his real name) is a world renown raCOON aiming to please his masters in Hollywood, so he can flaunt living the jet-set life with his horrible films. This one is in step with the latest political narrative of blaming everything on blacks a while whites are viewed as innocent as can be.

You know this story, an interracial romance (the two in love hardly touch each other or show affection) where the focal point is what is wrong with blacks.  In this case, Perry makes the blacks turn out to be 'racists' while whites are supposed to be the victims.  This is the focal point of this film and Christmas is the honorable mention in this film - not the focal point!

The directing and sound are of that of a straight to video thing and the only good thing is the picture quality.  Perry's lame jokes never make me laugh and instead, the actors recite them in a way to suggest that the jokes are funny, but they are not.  This film is nothing but anti-black propaganda and is yet another shift in Perry's whack films toward the mainstream.  Perry needs to stay in his lane as he is not a good enough director to do anything other than his brand (cheap) of film making, if you can call it that.  Pass on this!

Oh yeah, this film is also keeping in line with Perry's tradition of making black males the ENEMY of black women and white males.  I cannot name one Perry 'film' where the black man is not gay, an abuser, selfish, greedy or loses his black woman to a white man - all while the black male who directed these films wears a dress...",1423872000,2,1570,4.291525423728814

6618216,4,B00N8JIGT2,"I've been a huge fan of Tyler Perry's work long before the world knew him.  I have been saddened by some of his movie releases that went directly word for word the lines of his play in a lot instances which didn't fit the movie screen OR the plot of the movie.  His usage of his various actors and actresses who've appeared in his numerous plays & sitcoms, I applaud him for that and then weaving in actors/actresses that we love to see on the big screen.  A Madea Christmas did not disappoint with the storyline but it did with the casting.  I felt he hit the nail on the head with most of the cast but I did not like the role of the daughter ... I'm not a big fan of Tiki Sumpter for the fact that no matter the emotion that needs to be portrayed on screen - her face never changes nor is she good at making her voice match the emotion (happy, sad etc) which to me is not effective especially when you bouncing off of Ann Marie Horsford, it's called boring.  I do give this 4 stars b/c of the overall storyline and watching Larry the Cable Guy and Madea together on screen is stomach clinching hilarious! Seeing ""Blair"" on screen - plus! The guy from House of Paynes in the role of lawyer - loved that guy of HOP!",1420588800,,1215,4.13135593220339
6618217,1,B00N8JIGT2,"A relative who loves Tyler Perry movies thought this one was his worst.  In the original teaser trailers, there are kids sitting on Madea's lap as she plays a mall Santa. None of that was in the actual movie and my relative was disappointed at being hoodwinked.  I watched it and found this is a slow moving movie and once you see what the message is, you feel like someone in charge is being overly self righteous and probably thought of the entire underlying plot while having a half a glass of wine with a single ""Reason for the Season"" thought/cliche recollection. A saving grace was the comedy of Larry the Cable guy especially playing the dozens with Madea.",1420588800,4,663,4.563025210084033

The plot was very simple and I knew what was going to happen after the first 15 of the movie.  The acting was Tyler Perry typical.  A few notable actresses and everyone else amateur.

Tyler Perry is losing his touch.  Luckily I got this movie on sale, but I would have preferred renting at RedBox...or, better yet, borrowing from a friend.",1420416000,2,480,4.710843373493976

Perhaps Perry is running out of funny.",1420243200,,252,4.622222222222222

6618253,4,B00N8JIGT2,I love Tyler Perry's movies. They usually incorporate a strong message with a humorous plot. Ie... Diary of a mad black woman (my favorite) madea's family reunion ect... This one had a pretty soft message and the jokes were funny but far apart and few in between. All in all if you're a Tyler fan you'll like it but don't expect it to be your favorite madea movie,1420243200,,363,4.352941176470588

I think I got a defective DVD, but what can you do about it when you order from Amazon?  Wanted to watched it a second time, but couldn't stand the interruptions, so hopefully a friend has a copy I can watch that's o.k..",1420243200,,398,4.397260273972603

6618282,3,B00N8JIGT2,This movie was a typical Tyler Perry movie but a little more cheesy. Had some good laughs.  Loved Larry the Cable Guy and his wife.  I believe they are what added to the welcomed variety. Could have done without the two youtube stars at the end.  Added to the low budget feel.  I have no regrets buying it though because Tyler movies always have a clear touching message and lesson!,1420070400,,382,4.414285714285715

When I watched it with my husband, I was immediately sorry I had given the other one to my brother who is a minister.  He has many other Tyler Perry DVDs and is broad minded, but the increase of profanity and lewd innuendo by Larry the cable  guy and whoever portrayed his wife was a real turn off and embarrassment that I had given my brother this gift.

I watched this with my entire family on Thanksgiving, three daughters, three spouses and two grand kids.  Everyone loved it and wanted to watch it again the next day. Any funny adult issues were framed in such a way that minors would not ""get"" it was an adult situation or why it was so funny. Tyler Perry is so very gifted and needed for quality content these days where other producers seriously are lacking.  I guess its easy to create horror flicks, but when when the ""news"" is enough - try finding quality comedy and Tyler Perry has a corner on the market.

Without being a spoiler I thought the funniest part was when Madea jumped straight into the back of the Jeep-horizontal-speed being of the essence.",1419120000,,801,4.489655172413793

One that wants the bible everywhere and the war on Christmas crap.  We all know these delusional types who think everyone is out to get their cross!  He needs to stop preaching to that audience and make movies that appeal to a broader EDUCATED base.  Tyler seems like he has a brain when he opens his mouth.

The fact all the white people were hillbillies is downright offensive.  Again, back to my point of the target audience (hint, hint).  Anyways, I don't think Lifetime would have picked this one up and that is saying a lot.  To anyone who is going to say he can make whatever movies he wants I got a response to that one.

6618516,3,B00N8JIGT2,"Madea is always fun to watch but the movies have become very formulaic...there is always a crisis in which someone is abused or in dire need of help. Madea helps out with her twisted interpretation on spiritual advice and she usually kicks bad-people-butt (much to the audience's delight). There is always some goofy family members that Medea locks horns with and sets straight. It's all in good fun but a little tired. This outing, however, has a bright spot with the pairing of Larry the Cable Guy and Kathy Najimy. They have great chemistry and both are hilarious. Anna Marie Horsford's character gets old really fast!",1418169600,,621,4.867924528301887

6618537,2,B00N8JIGT2,"I have enjoyed most of Tyler Perry's work, especially his Madea character, but his recent Madea movies consist of mediocre story lines, choppy segues, and outdated stock characters. This movie is particularly simple in context with amusing humor, lacking the snappish wit Madea is notorious for employing to create shocking, yet relatable, anecdotal jokes. I have not given up on Madea movies, yet, but I was quite disappointed after having to wait a year to watch this on Amazon. I would definitely suggest renting this movie before purchasing it.",1418083200,,548,5.168539325842697

6618542,2,B00N8JIGT2,"Wow, I can't believe all the good reviews here.  Hate to say it, but this movie is a mass-market brainless waste of time.  The only reason I even saw it (I have never seen another Madea movie and am sure I never willingly will now after this) was that my son was in it as one of the schoolchildren.  Otherwise, it is a total waste of time and the best acting performance in it is given by Larry the Cable Guy (that should tell you something!).  Other than Tika Sumpter being quite gorgeous to watch, afraid I have to say there is nothing else redeeming about this- it would have been a mediocre Hallmark Channel Holiday movie.  That all said, I know some people like this sort of thing- I know someone who willingly saw it three times!

Wish I could say better, as again my son is in it and would like for it to be something to be more proud of and perhaps even  lead to greater acting opportunities for him; alas, no.",1417996800,,918,4.211428571428572

6618568,3,B00N8JIGT2,"Bias Alert! I have over 35 Tyler Perry films and plays on dvd and I've seen his plays live twice. But to be honest I was not greatly impressed with this film. Maybe I am suffering a little Tyler Perry burnout. If you are a fan of Larry the Cable Guy and his brand of comedy then you should truly enjoy this film. Madea is always Madea and I personally enjoy all of Tyler's works that he stars in just a little bit more. My complaint with this movie is that some of these people do the dumbest things possible and these dumb actions set the plot for this movie. I don't give spoiler alerts but this film starts by telling us that someone has done something ridiculous, which is followed by a family member doing something else equally as ridiculous and that is where I got stuck. As all of Tyler Perry's works do, this film addresses character flaws and how to correct them. It points out the errors of lying, bullying and spousal abuse and the damage they can cause.",1417824000,,966,4.313186813186813
