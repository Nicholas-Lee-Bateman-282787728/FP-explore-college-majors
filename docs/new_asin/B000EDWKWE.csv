2516782,4,B000EDWKWE,Only negative is that the English dialog lacks good emotions compared to Spanish and Japanese audio,1281916800,,99,5.25
2516783,5,B000EDWKWE,"Why is ADV doing this?! We want to see the Asgard and Poseidon arcs! I say we start a petition for them to finish what they started! I mean come on, they fully released that other anime Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, why is Saint Seiya any different?",1192320000,8,249,4.319148936170213

2516785,3,B000EDWKWE,"I bought the two of the collections and their good, and I like the company that made this collections of movies finishes doing all of the volumes. I know Poseidon its a good challenge, and I like to watch that again. So please get to work guys and release the other part that we know its the best part.",1153785600,5,302,4.135593220338983
2516786,1,B000EDWKWE,"It's really unfortunate when a company like ADV has access to the gold mine that is Saint Seiya, a classic anime from the 80s that has since become a cult phenomenon all over the world, in particular Latin American countries, such as Mexico, where the dub there is one of the best I have ever had the the priviledge of listening to. The actors there seemed to be able to display that little something called ""emotions"" as opposed to monologing and reading childish comebacks that really insult the seriousness of the anime.

As stated above, it is really sad that such a great anime is lowered in quality due to actors who mostly do this kind of job as a paycheck as opposed to really investing themselves into the characters they play, as they are supposed to do.

On a technical note, these dvds are very clean visually and do sound really good, except for some minor static sound in the Japanese track.

GIVE US A SPANISH TRACK, ADV!!!! You have no idea what kind of money you would make if you made that available. Funimation is doing it with their Dragon Ball Z dvds. You should too.",1148947200,19,1088,4.484848484848484
2516787,1,B000EDWKWE,"The show gets five stars, but ADV gets zero. I can't believe they made us buy the first twelve volumes of saint seiya and then not produce anymore. Its been over a year since they realesed volume twelve and ever since they haven't released the rest of the volumes. I'm pretty sure that we can all be asserted that the rest of the volumes won't be released. WHAT A RIP OFF!!! Hopefully that in the near future a decent company can take on the task of releasing the whole saint seiya series. It is truly one of the best anime of all time. Please saint seiya fans, show your support so that saint seiya is fully released.",1147392000,17,618,4.2905982905982905
