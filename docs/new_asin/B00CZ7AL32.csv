5761696,5,B00CZ7AL32,"Cary Grant and Doris Day display wonderful timing and both word and look responses.  The best of dialogue by Stanley Shapiro and Nate Monaster and the best of direction by Delbert Mann.  The vignettes with Audrey Meadows and Doris Day, Gig Young and Cary Grant, Gig Young and Alan Hewitt, were perfect comedy.  John Astin was excellent as the foil for Doris Day.  The whole movie is great humor and a fum romp.",1377216000,,410,4.575342465753424
5761697,5,B00CZ7AL32,"This is one of those Doris Day movies that never had a real good video release. There was a pan and scan videotape and a 4:3 letterbox videotape and DVD (not sure about laserdisc releases) from Artisan. The transfer, besides being non anamorphic was soft and fuzzy. That DVD came in the early days of the format and while other early DVD releases got improved updated releases, Mink was left in the dust.

A blu ray of That Touch Of Mink seemed like a long shot and yet, here it is.

Finally, a respectable transfer for this movie that paired Cary Grant and Doris Day for the only time(and also had Gig Young, John Astin, Dick  Sargent, Audrey Meadows and even some New York Yankees legends). It is much improved in sharpness and color but it is not perfect. The print used is nice but does show a bit of wear. You know what though? I happen to like seeing the little spots and marks on the film to remind me I am watching a film as long as they aren't overwhelming. It is a pretty pleasing presentation and a quantum leap over previous releases.

Audio is single track mono and it's fine.

No extras, like other Olive Film releases. If I remember, the old DVD did carry a trailer. I wish it was carried over to this release.

Olive films have been doing releases of older films that are quite obscure and I like old obscure movies. They are a bit pricey but I understand the financial aspects of sub licensing these movies from a studio in the small runs they obviously do.

But for that person that was thinking that a certain loved film was all but forgotten and condemned to a shoddy release or no release at all only to have it spring up here is like hitting the jackpot.

That Touch Of Mink is one of those little jackpots for me.",1375833600,40,1736,4.32

5761707,5,B00CZ7AL32,"Philip Shayne (Cary Grant) rich industrial owner, accidentally splashes Cathy Timberlake (Doris Day) out of work computer operator, as his car drives by. He sends his assistant Roger (Gig Young) to apologies. This becomes the beginning of a comedy of misunderstanding, misidentification, and a strange relationship between Philip and Cathy.

Although Doris Day and Carry Grant insure that this is a fun comedy, it is the bevy of other well-known actors that take this to new heights. Audrey Meadows plays the protective big sister type who hears about Mr. Shayne's exploits over the phone. Gig young is Mr. Shayne's go-for and finds out first hand what people and dogs think of him. Don Knotts is a shoe salesman as he is in another Doris day movie [Move Over Darling (1963)]. You defiantly do not want to miss the scene with Everett Beasley's (John Astin) date with Cathy.

My favorite scene is where she falls out the hotel window and is picked up. She says, "" I Fell out of mister Shayne's apartment. See that I'm returned""",1501977600,,1026,4.823863636363637
5761708,5,B00CZ7AL32,"I've been lovin' Doris Day films since I was a young girl. This is probably at the top of my favs list. If you're not familiar with her work, you might want to begin with some films from the 1940's...""Romance on the High Seas"" is a good one. Later, in the 1960's she did some hilarious comedies-a classic is ""Send Me No Flowers"" with Rock Hudson and Tony Randal. In this film you get to see the inside of an Automat-a fun option folks had back then for dining. Kids would really LOVE these cafeterias today. Imagine, inserting a few coins in a slot and out comes your lunch or dinner. Classic Fun!",1500336000,,597,4.292035398230088

Assisting Cary Grant magnificently playing his role, is quite a hilarious bunch of characters. Watch the taxi driver's deliriously funny facial expressions. Or the government official's body language. Every time I watch this movie, I literally roll in laughter. The whole of the movie is wrapped around Cary Grant's character. And it is a pure delight. Once again  it puzzles you, how our gorgeous Cary Grant, our indomitable Cary Grant can always project onto the screen such magic, such lasting pleasure, such enjoyment  every time he is in a given movie..",1458950400,7,701,4.833333333333333

5761748,4,B00CZ7AL32,"An odd movie for Doris Day in that she plays an unemployed woman willing to have an affair with the guy whose driver splashed her as he drove past.  The idea of Doris Day as a kept woman is hilarious.

Purportedly, Cary Grant hated this film.  Rock Hudson was supposed to play the part but director Delbert Mann wanted Grant instead.  Grant plays the part in an aloof fashion, as though he could have cared less one way or the other.  As I am a Doris Day fan, this doesnt bother me.  Gig Young, Audrey Meadows, and John Astin are great as the comic relief.  Gig Young alone is utterly priceless.

Its a cute movie thats slightly inhibited.  A fun frolic nonetheless.",1451347200,2,666,4.39344262295082

5761763,4,B00CZ7AL32,"Cary Grant and Doris Day at their best together!  The delicate handling of the Day character's decision of whether or not to have premarital relations with the Grant character makes this a classic and a call back to different time.  Cary Grant at his best charming self so you believe the struggle to say 'no' and desire to say 'yes' that leads to main plot points.  The cleaver humorous addition of the Grant character's friend and his own involvement is almost more enjoyable than the main story!  He meets the Day character and bets Grant on what her choice will be, then works to win the bet.  Okay, we have seen that before, but his side conversations with his therapist really ups the humor.  John Aston's supporting role as another man interested in the Day's character is another plus to the move.

5761818,5,B00CZ7AL32,"This was one of the first Doris Day Movies that I ever saw. It is also one of my favorites. It is a love story with a ton of comedy as Doris and Cary fall in love. The movie also stars Gig Young and Audrey Meadows as well as John Astin. Even though there is a lot of innuendo, there are no real nude scenes or cursing of any kind. Actually a pleasure to watch and not have to worry if you have youngsters around. Also, Beautiful gowns and clothing shown on Miss Day and the cast. Kinda makes me wish I was around during this time period. It is a classic and I believe the only time that Cary Grant and Doris Day were paired together.",1402963200,10,633,3.9921259842519685

5761826,5,B00CZ7AL32,"I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  You might wonder whether casting Doris Day and Cary Grant together was a good match -- it was!  Sure, the story is corny by today's standards, but you will still laugh because Doris Day carries off her part so well.  It is a little suggestive in places (if you have young children) -- otherwise it is squeaky clean.",1397865600,,365,4.260869565217392

Excellent all-star classic cast with Cary Grant, Audrey Meadows (The Honeymooners), Dick Sargeant (Bewitched), the actor who played ""Gomez"" on the Addams Family (he's hillarious in this!).  Everyone's acting is top-notch.  A great comedy classic.",1385078400,2,296,5.659090909090909
5761836,5,B00CZ7AL32,"One of my favorite Doris Day/Cary Grant movies from way back when.  It has probably inspired a story or two.  As, I'm sure, it has inspired other writers.  The script is smart, and still fresh after all these years, and so funny.  Take a line by Audrey Meadows who plays Doris Day's character's best friend about a smarmy character who is always trying to get Doris up to his apartment: ""He's so low, when they bury him, they're going to have to dig up!""",1382313600,,454,4.369047619047619
5761837,5,B00CZ7AL32,"I am an avid Doris Day fan and it is so exciting to be seeing her movies finally  being released in Blu Ray. Touch of Mink is a great comedy. Miss Day looks great and is a top comedy star. The dvd version of this film was never letterboxed and was poor quality. This blu ray is amazing in it's clarity and sound. A must must for all Day fans. I also purchased from Amazon Blu Ray versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much, Pillow Talk and a 3 disc set feauturing Do Not Disturb, Move Over Darling and Caprice. Waiting patiently for Young At Heart being released in  January on Blu Ray.",1379289600,16,581,4.087719298245614
5761838,5,B00CZ7AL32,"Excellent remastering and transfer to Blu-ray.  Nice to watch this classic, early 60s comedy with proper color saturation and resolution.",1378166400,2,137,5.85
5761839,3,B00CZ7AL32,"First let me say that this is one of my favorite movies. Cary Grant and Doris Day rank as my favorite actors. And this movie teams them wonderfully. And even better yet, Gig Young absolutely steals the show, when he is on screen I cannot help but to ROTFLOL. However, this Blu Ray movie commands a premium price (to me, anything above $20 is a premium price). So what do you get for the premium price? Absolutely nothing! The video is definitely hi-def, and when I saw the first screens I was amazed at the clarity (my DVD copy is horrible). But then I noticed several issues.

1) The video has not been cleaned. In some segments the amount of holes in the film make it appear as if I was watching the movie in a snow flurry; extremely distracting.

2) There are no subtitles. None. Not in any language. There is no excuse for this whatsoever; even the cheap DVDs of Cary Grant movies I bought recently have subtitles. But this premium Blu ray has none!!!!

3) The only sound track is in English. I don't care that much, but for a premium price one would expect multiple sound tracks in various languages.

4) Standard Blu-Rays (priced between $15 and $20) typically contain all sorts extras - making of the film, newsreel shorts and cartoons (very common in DVDs and Blu_Rays for older movies). And this premium Blu-Ray contains absolutely no extras! Inconceivable! (Noticed that I had to get a Princess Bride reference in!)

If this Blu-Ray was priced under $10, I would give it 4 stars (5 stars if it was under $5, it is definitely worth a bargain basement price). However, since it carries a premium price tag, I award it only 2 stars. But, I admit that I would still buy this Blu-Ray even knowing about the shoddy manufacturing of this Blu-Ray, so I have to bump it up by one star: 3 stars.",1377216000,23,1795,4.460365853658536
