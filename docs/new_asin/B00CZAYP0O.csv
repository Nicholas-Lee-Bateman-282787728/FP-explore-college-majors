5761840,3,B00CZAYP0O,"""Barrio Brawler"" is a hard-working martial arts drama, the greatest triumph of which is that it provides a platform for a bunch of very talented film fighters to display their talents. It's far from perfect, with a trailer that's definitely better paced than the film itself, but if you happen to like action flicks which mix a bit of wrestling with the tricking while leaning heavily on dramatic content, this one could interest you.

The story: when he finds himself in danger of losing his dojo, martial arts instructor Carlos Castillo (Marco Alvarez) gives in to the urgings of his brother Ricky (Dennis Ruel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contour/dp/B000YGE0KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contour</a>) and enters an underground fighting tournament run by a notorious gangster (O. G. Rivera).

""Dramatic"" martial art features have their work cut out for them: especially when featuring performers whose kicks are stronger than their acting skills, they must balance trying to touch their audience with a soulful story and supplying them with the proper adrenaline rushes. When this is done right, you get a movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Hell/dp/B0000DBJ2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Hell</a>, from which a viewer can glean a respectable tale while still getting his karate fix. When this is done wrong, you get a film like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Ring/dp/B000Y9Q59M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Ring</a>, throughout which a viewer yells ""Just fight already!"" at the screen while enduring uncomfortably-staged drama. ""Barrio Brawler"" is somewhere between those two: there's a respectable amount of action to see, but while the dramatic portions aren't all that bad, you still get the feeling that the movie has undertaken something too complex for itself. On one hand it's a family drama focusing on the relationship between brothers and between separated parents, while on the other hand it's a gangster fantasy with nonstop posturing and excess profanity. The two clash inharmoniously and I'm left with the opinion that it all seemed smoother in the filmmakers' imaginations.

The action content is an effort by the Stunt People team, whose work has greatly benefited several movies in the past. In this one, they attempt to mix their usual acrobatic kickboxing with some wrestling, the result of which is good but far from spectacular. I loved the first substantial fight between Alvarez and Ruel for its tight pacing and flawless filming, and the final battle between Alvarez and Morgan Benoit (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forbidden-Kingdom/dp/B001BEK8HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forbidden Kingdom</a>) is also a strong showing, but the five fights between them feature choreography that had to be shot in shorter segments, and they generally lack that satisfying back & forth pacing. Marco makes a powerful presence for a first-timer and fits the role of his character well, but Morgan Benoit is unconvincingly built up as a beast whose main strength is fighting dirty. Just about everybody looks good while delivering their kicks, but in the end, there's just not enough oomph to bolster this one's three-star rating.

Despite being marketed as a ""MMA Masterpiece,"" the movie actually expresses a negative sentiment towards fighting for profit, which may displease some of the audience it's being advertised to. Then again, I'm relatively apathetic about the film now that I've seen it, so it's hard to say how a more intrigued viewer might feel. It's worth a peek, but I wouldn't necessarily put it ahead of many other movies of the same genre.",1381449600,2,3783,5.872727272727273
5761841,4,B00CZAYP0O,"Just when you thought THE ASYLUM distributes another stinkin' pile of low budget poo, it redeems itself by releasing this action packed little gem!!  Drama, thrills and nothing but ass-kickin' martial-arts brawls.  It's got a little something for everyone wrapped up in the plot but it satisfies the martial arts aficionado whole-heartedly.  A great indie martial-arts pleaser that's a cut above the rest with top-notch fighting choreography and a solid story to boot.  DEFINITELY CHECK THIS ONE OUT!!",1378425600,2,501,5.384615384615385
5761842,4,B00CZAYP0O,"Stars: Morgan Benoit.
A Jose Montesinos picture.

When I was in my action/adventure movie immersion in the '70s and '80s, Michael Dudikoff would come out with a American Ninja flick like every 8 monthes.
Barrio Brawler brings us again to the James Ryan,Leo Fong, and David Heavener School Of Acting- Athletes from decades back.
The scenes come off ""ROCKY"" like from the raw first movie,Not the manufactured physique of 2-6 ?
Jose Montesinos has a superstar, Morgan Benoit,Who like Jean-Claude Van Damme in his first major role is the bad guy, See what we are getting at - Barrio Brawler is awesome to watch !
The hero,Marco Alvarez, Has the underdog giving us his all acting style,Very welcome performance.",1372032000,,706,4.932773109243698
8587793,4,B00CZAYP0O,"I had the pleasure of watching this film with the Director. The director is really a very delightful person and I highly recommend meeting him and getting a chance to get to know him. That said, he did agree this film has a fair amount of padding. That the shoot schedule didn't allow for too many takes or shots that were more elaborate. The film can be slow to start, but the cinematography and fights scenes are exceptional! They are stylized in a modern way and done so that it lets you feel the fight even more than most big Hollywood productions. As the stunts and choreography allow you to really see and feel the weight of a human body and not be bogged down in haphazard wire work and CGI. A piece that while slow at times, is still very much worth a look.",1442275200,,765,4.2827586206896555

8587800,5,B00CZAYP0O,"I'm a fan of The Asylum films.....well....not all of them. However, ""American Brawler"" proves that you can make a martial arts film OLD SCHOOL and still get a decent fan base! No wire work and no CGI at all. It took 12 days to film the whole entire movie and I think they did one hell of a job piecing it all together the way that they did. The acting was good. A very good stalwart performance. Even from the bad guys! The movie caught my attention because Hollywood is captivated with over exaggerating martial arts. What American Brawler did was strip it down and worked on the actual stunts. That's what I'm talking about! The story was predictable, I won't lie about that but going back to the rudiments of stunt work just for this film was just what the movie needed and begged for it. I know that there will be people out there that will beg to differ on that as they read my review and that's fine. However, take a look at some of the other higher budget martial arts films out there today. A lot of the stunt work disappoints me and not many fight scenes impress me these days. Overall, as you're reading this, I can guarantee that this film is the best out of The Asylum product line for 2013. Check it out, you won't be dissapointed.",1385683200,,1244,4.32051282051282
8587801,4,B00CZAYP0O,It's kinda Every Which Way but Loose without the monkey and white supremacist bikers.  Marco Antonio Alvarez proves that he's the Philo Beddoe of the MMA redemption sub-genre with his angsty performance.  I still wish there was a monkey.  Can't wait for American Brawler 2:  The Rise of the Monkey.,1385164800,,298,4.9
8587802,4,B00CZAYP0O,"Every once and a while a movie comes along that truly changes your life. Schindlers List, The Godfather, Blade Runner. To that list, I add American Brawler. I am a better man for watching Marco Antonio Alvarez defend his familys honor in the ring of martial combat. The man is like the love child of Chuck Norris and Henry Rollins topped off with a pinch of Swayze. Nobody is putting this guy in a corner unless you want to see your vocal cords ripped out and thrown to the ground while you try to scream.  Hell to the yeah. See this movie!!!",1384992000,2,542,4.313725490196078
