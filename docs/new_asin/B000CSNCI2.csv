It was a joy to watch Mark DeCarlo in a role that seemed written just for him.  I love to watch his television shows and it was great to see him bigger than life on the big screen.  Can't get enough of him!  And I have to add that Jeanette Puhich was a riot!  Where DOES she get it?  Anyway, I would recommend this to adults and kids alike.",1135382400,4,499,4.072164948453608

2472832,4,B000CSNCI2,"Definitely one of the better indie ""Mormonwood"" comedies. This one definitely plays better to LDS members, but should be funny and enjoyable to just about anyone. Both the mobsters and Mormons are played as a bit over-the-top stereotypes, it's still a lot of fun, and surprisingly well done. Nearly Hollywood production values.

The FBI sends him, his wife, and son to Utah with new identities and the movie follows the new activities that they get involved in and the friends they make. I won't give away the ending, but just know that the mob is out looking for them. ;D

2472872,4,B000CSNCI2,"Let's be honest here, the movie idea itself is utterly lame. You've got to be tired, drunk or extremely bored to even consider watching a film this lamely named. However, with that being said, my exhausted husband and I did watch this movie all the way through and it's so lame it's awesome! We're well read on Mormonism, so we know there were a LOT of lies regarding Mormonism in this movie (although to the untrained eye, it's fairly subtle). In addition, most of the characters were poorly written and the actors certainly needed more experience in order to pull off their roles.

I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone who, like I said before, isn't tired, drunk or extremely bored. We liked it, but we're more likely the exception than the rule.",1332288000,,760,4.6716417910447765

2472877,5,B000CSNCI2,"This movie shows, once again, that the Mormons have a good time laughing at themselves. Like other tight knit groups the LDS culture has its share of sterotypes and cliches and poking fun at them is a hoot. This movie does that so well. It also emphasizes the need to accept those who are different from ourselves - something I wish was more common among all denominations. If you aren't LDS invite a Mormon friend over to watch this with you and you can laugh at the movie and your friend's response because they will be rolling on the floor laughing.

They also enjoyed it as the ""mobster family"" makes the types of comments and asks the questions my family often ponders.  It is a family film- so the mobsters are not really all that hardcore but you do get some funny interactions that are pretty true to life with people who are unfamiliar with the LDS Church.
I hope that LDS families will watch this movie and learn that you can be a friend, coworker, neighbor etc. and not have to constantly try to convert someone.  Just care for their needs and the rest will follow! Also, you get a good look at the Ward mentality- those supposed Ward royalty often shape the opinions of the group based on perception instead of doctrine and can sometimes get in the way of true Christian compassion.

2472882,3,B000CSNCI2,"This movie is a somewhat enjoyable film geared towards members of the LDS faith. It has a few funny moments that and it is pretty well acted (for lower budget movies at least).

The movies premise is about a Mobster who cuts a deal with the FBI (to stay out of jail) and squeels on his mob boss in return for his squeeling he and his family are put into a witness protection program and are sent to live in Provo, Utah.

The movies premise is what it's like for a hard core mobster and his family to live in happy valley.

Like I said this movie does have a few good laughs and the acting is good (for a low budget film).

The problem with the film are as follows:

1 - Too preachy... sometimes the film tries too hard to preach about the LDS faith instead of tell a story

2 - On my DVD copy the sound didn't match the movement on people's lips. I would think that would be something you should check out before you start producing the film!

3 - Just an average good one time watch.... nothing you would want to see over and over again. This would be a good one time rental or library movie.

Decent just not great.",1158105600,,1117,4.091743119266055
2472883,5,B000CSNCI2,Mobsters and Mormons is by far the best film Halestone Entertainment has ever produced. It is very funny and provides a wonderful message.  I think they really hit a homerun with this film.  It is a must see!  Leaves you feeling very satisfied!,1147305600,3,244,4.627906976744186
2472884,4,B000CSNCI2,"This is another one of those movies worth watching on DVD, but not going to the theater to see. (I know, moot point since it's no longer in theaters.)

On the down side: this movie engages in stereotype portrayals of Italians and cartoonish Mafia characters, as well as some Mormon stereotypes.  Another weakness was the casting of the minor characters. Outside of the two main families (the Mormon family and the Mafia family), almost all the actors seemed very weak.

But if you can suspend your disbelief of or annoyance with the stereotypes (and poor casting) just a little, the magic of the movie is the combination of the two stereotypes, and how they play against each other.  Sort of a ""fish out of water"" theme.

I also hand it to the writer/director for going with a little more intense humor than previous Mormon movies. Parts were slapstick, but not as silly or as unbelievable in say ""Home Teachers"" or ""The R.M.""

I'm going to watch it again, just so I can re-tell the Mafia version of the 3 Little Pigs story.

I think non-LDS would like this movie and see the humor.  But if you're one of those uptight LDS who's been offended at other Halestorm Entertainment pictures so far (Singles Ward, The RM, Home Teachers), you'll probably be offended by this one too.

This movie is rated PG, but it's just barely PG. There's no more violence than some of the old 3 Stooges or Little Rascals stuff I remember seeing.",1142553600,10,1424,4.596837944664031
2472885,5,B000CSNCI2,"When I saw my first LDS-made comedy movie a few years back, I swore I would never see another as long as I lived. Then I heard about Mobsters and Mormons. I saw the preview and I thought, ""Alright, I'll give this one a try."" I didn't see it until it came out in DVD and I've never been so entertained in a movie in all of my life! The comedy in here was so funny, I had a serious side-ache by the time the movie ended.

It has this tough mobster who is in hiding with his family in the good ol' State Utah. And all he wants in the world is to be left alone and have a decent cup of coffee. But alas, nothing really happens that way. Aside from the unique humor about this movie, I loved the message it was getting across about 'true love and friendship'. I was raised in this fashion and it's a good feeling when people out there are finally recognizing what Christ's love is *really* about. The ending made me smile because it left with a feeling that the mobster and his family are settled and happy where they are emotionally and spiritually.

This is a definate for LDS and non-LDS members alike! :)",1137801600,14,1103,4.149532710280374

I love how the italian guy says ""Oh!"" a lot, because I'm a italian guy and I say ""Oh!"" a lot. not to mention how totally babealicious the pregnant wife is. All the characters were really likable. My favorite was the sister because she was dealing with problems everyone has dealt with, like her parents not letting her do homework, or her boyfriend hanging out with her brother and not her. If I had to pick one problem with movie I'd say it was the ending. I think it would have been better if the mobster family converted. Idk I'm just not comfortable watching a movie where I know the main characters will go to hell. It's rated pg but I'd say it should be rated R. There's some language and action in it that's too extreme for children and a kid even cries in it so you know it's a very adult film. I'm glad I bought it from the thrift store, but it baffles me as to why this was in the family section. Overall a great movie just not for kids.",1509235200,,974,4.158730158730159
8101793,4,B000CSNCI2,"For the most part, LDS cinema (by which I mean films aimed primarily at the Mormon market, not films put out by the church itself) has long had a reputation as cheap, cheesy, and pretty much incomprehensible to anyone outside the LDS faith.  Let's face it, films like ""The RM,"" ""The Singles Ward,"" ""The Home Teachers,"" and all their ilk aren't aimed at people outside the church, and so while they may be hilarious to people familiar with the quirks and foibles of Mormon culture (especially Utah-Mormon culture), an outsider is probably going to be baffled while watching.  I've learned to keep my expectations low when it comes to Mormon comedies, and so when a family member encouraged me to watch ""Mobsters and Mormons,"" I went in with the bar set low and the expectation that it would be cheap and goofy.

Boy, was I wrong.  ""Mobsters and Mormons"" is not only very funny, but it has relatively high production values on par with a Hollywood comedy film, and plenty of humor that even those outside the LDS church can appreciate.

The mobster in ""Mobsters and Mormons"" is Carmine ""The Beans"" Pasquale, a Philadelphia gangster who's been passed over for a promotion in the Family... and whose own family life is rocky, with an unhappy wife and a son he barely knows.  When the FBI busts him, however, he's given the option to testify against the mob in exchange for protection... and soon he and his family are entered into the Witness Protection Program, and are whisked away from big-city Philadelphia to the suburbs of Happy Valley, Utah.  Carmine is baffled by his friendly, non-drinking, church-going neighbors, and even more so when they reach out to him and invite him and his family to dinner and on church and community outings.  His wife, however, finds herself making new friends in this community, and even his rebellious son finds a kindred soul in the teenage sister of the local church's interim bishop.  But even as Carmine and his family struggle to fit into a community of mini-vans, scrapbooking stores, and bad coffee, the mob isn't through with him, and their search might place both Carmine's family and the community of Happy Valley in danger...

I will admit that if you're a member of the LDS church, you'll probably get more out of this film than a non-member.  But the film is set up in a manner that even non-Mormons will enjoy and get a kick out of it.  The humor is accessible to almost everyone, and anyone who's moved to a strange new community will identify with the struggles of the Pasquale family.  True, both Carmine's family and the resident Mormons play true to a lot of the stereotypes, but it's not exaggerated to the point of obnoxiousness, and we get some good character development outside those stereotypes as well.  And the acting in this film is excellent -- not over-the-top as many LDS comedies tend to be.

Beyond the comedy aspects, however, this film does take a slightly more serious look at some of the flaws of the LDS community -- not in a muck-raking or caustic way, but simply highlighting that we do have a tendency to look down on people outside our faith and criticize their flaws while ignoring our own.  And the story itself isn't a conversion story, but a fish-out-of-water story about a family's struggle to fit in and the efforts people in the community make to make them feel welcome... and the way others in the same community would rather ostracize or gossip about them.  This is a lesson we all need to take to heart, both inside and outside the LDS church...

Very funny, well-done, and accessible to audiences both inside and outside the Mormon church, ""Mobsters and Mormons"" is probably one of the best of the LDS comedies, second only to ""The Best Two Years.""  It's a surprisingly enjoyable film, made all the better by good performances all around and a high production value.  Recommended.",1489795200,,3868,4.727678571428571
