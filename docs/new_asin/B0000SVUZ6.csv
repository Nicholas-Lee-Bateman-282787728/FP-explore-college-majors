Not to mention the guy hates his freakin' life and it's a little depressing. For example, in the song it says, ""Pat THINKS he's a really happy man."" WTF is that about?! Anyone who says they think they are happy is crying themselves to sleep every night in the back of their delivery truck while using the letters of unsuspecting townsfolk to dry away the tears streaming down their face. What a miserable human being. Let me know when the guy finally goes postal, which WILL happen - it's only a matter of time. I might tune in to that episode. Oh by the way, my kid loves it.

The movie was slow at times and weird at times, but the animation was friendly in colors and shapes.  I'm sure it would attract kids to watch it because of the animation and the singing/music behind it.  However, it reminds me of the American Idol and Simon Fuller, which is not what I want kids to idolize.  That cannot be what kids should learn about British culture, the Idol series.  It would have been nice to offer some culture in this movie that kids can learn about British life, and not have kids believe technology or even robots are completely bad.",1445472000,,719,4.335820895522388

Not only are there hoards of Patbots (robots that infiltrate and fool the whole town) and Jessbots, but they won't die! There is a touching moment where they defeat a few robots and Pat gives a speech about the importance of family and community. Then more Patbots flood the theater and a Jessbot appears to attack jess without any further, terminator style. That's when I turned out of. I'm my preschooler didn't have nightmares last night.
