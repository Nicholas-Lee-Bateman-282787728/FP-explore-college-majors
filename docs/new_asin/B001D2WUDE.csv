3523749,5,B001D2WUDE,HEY - WHOEVER YOU ARE WHO DECIDES TO PUT OUT THESE DVDS - IF YOU LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU INTEND TO CONTINUE PUTTING OUT THE ENTIRE SERIES PEOPLE WILL BE MUCH MORE ENCOURAGED TO PURCHASE SEASON 1!!!!!!!!!!!,1231027200,2,206,4.447368421052632
3523750,5,B001D2WUDE,"The release of ""Spin City"" on DVD could not be more timely. Not only was Michael J. Fox's character smoothing out the wrinkles in his boss (Barry Bostwick)s' debut term as mayor of New York, but the newest hire in the Mayor's office was black gay activist Carter Heywood (Michael Boatman) as head of minority affairs. Early episodes not only dealt with Carter trying to increase AIDS funding, and establish a needle exchange, but seven shows into the run he staged a mock wedding to protest the mayor's stand against gay marriage. Plus, Boatman and Fox's characters share an onscreen kiss to make guest star Luke Perry (Carter's bisexual ex) jealous. The jokes all hold up surprisingly well a dozen years later, thanks to cocreators Gary David Goldberg (who previously worked with Fox on ""Family Ties"") and Bill Lawrence (who went on to launch ""Scrubs."")
  While ""Ellen"" and ""Will & Grace"" top most people's lists of gay sitcoms, it's perhaps easy to forget the GLAAD awards that ""Spin City"" racked up by not only making the black gay man not only one the smartest characters on the show, but by giving him the same amount of depth as its lead.",1226966400,5,1144,4.715
3523751,5,B001D2WUDE,"But I'm happy it's finally out, and given a proper release -- meaning keeping the number of episodes per disc to a reasonable level to preserve image and sound quality (6 per disc in ""Spin City""'s case), bonus features (which admittedly I haven't seen but for TV shows they're a rarity), and solid plastic cases for the discs to be stored in.

I'm hoping the remaining seasons come out on a swift basis; this show certainly deserves it!  But, for now, thank you for releasing the 1st season!",1226620800,,491,4.568181818181818
3523752,5,B001D2WUDE,"Having made his initial TV debut years earlier as Republican Alex P. Keaton, Michael J. Fox blatantly crossed the political aisle in his triumphant TV return.

Now he is playing Democratic New York Deputy Mayor Mike Flaherty. Flaherty is a curious combination of Al Gore and George Stephanopoulos with lots of requisite/inevitable `Kennedy family' references tossed in.

His boss is Mayor Randall Winston (Barry Bostwick), a more-or-less transparent spoof of Bill Clinton. In terms of physical structure at least, there is a fair resemblance. Vocal-inflection and intelligence, I don't see a comparison, but hey, politics is the game of compromise. You take what you can get.

Basically, this is a small-screen version of Primary Colors: a warm-hearted but satirical look at Democratic politics. And the 24-episode season won't make you incur a personal deficit in order to own it!

A favorite episode is ""Kiss Me Stupid"" where another childhood crush, Luke Perry returns to his former boyfriend Carter Heywood--with some very important but unexpected news. After having dated each other for a while, Luke's character now dates women, even planning on marriage. Spence Kamer wants Carter to be his best man for this impending ceremony. Perry's apparent comfort with publically delivering `flirty' lines to another man sincerely impressed me, having grown up seeing him merely as a `teen idol'. Instead of Sheen in the later seasons, the production crew for this series should have convinced Perry to sign on as a replacement for Fox. Who knew he was capable of successfully delivering sitcom work? I certainly hadn't.

Being a disability advocate, I easily imagined myself in ""Deaf Becomes Her"".  Misunderstandings about the Mayor's intention towards the deaf community (and more generalized, the disability community!) eventually get successfully resolved. Arriving at mutual ground, Mike and the city's leading deaf advocate realize they do share a mutual desire to help people--and maybe more.

Mike is a politician, but he's also on the prowl only for true and lasting love. An ongoing storyline this season is his romance with news reporter Ashley Schaeffer (Carla Gugino)---and how sincerely heartbroken he becomes upon their breakup (""Bye-Bye, Love""). Rather than a temporary fling with the inevitable `campaign trail...etc' woman, Mike concedes that he is looking for something deeper and safer (""Striptease"").

This is exactly why Mike is so charming; he is political without being `sleazy' or the stereotypical know-it-all. He's still our lovable `guy-next door'!

After Mike (duh), my second favorite permanent staff member has to be Carter Heywood (Michael Boatman). As the Mayor's ""Diversity Liaison"" (who comes on in the ""Pilot""), he is supposed to perform outreach with and for `diverse' community organizations. Otherwise, presumably these groups would not have their fair share of representation at City Hall. For it's not that the other staff are insensitive or `not diverse' they just juggle multiple `other concerns' in the ever-compartmentalized world of public service. There is always too much to do and never enough time or money.

Perpetual pulls between his previous ""outsider"" grassroots community organizing and now being on the `inside' gets best illustrated in ""Pride and Prejudice"". The same needle exchange program which Carter believes would halt (or even eliminate) the spread of AIDS throughout New York ultimately must get withdrawn for political expediency. It's a powerful lesson for Carter to concede that the `edgiest' public policies will not always work the best in the staid world of bureaucracy. Carter is passionate about his causes, but he's also genuinely intelligent and articulate--rather than being a `token' who is appointed merely to fill a slot.

Since Boatman and the other actors merely could have been one-dimensional tokens for Fox and Bostwick to bounce their one-liners off of, it's appreciated that they have substantive plots of their own throughout this season (and the series). Technically it's 'his' show, but Fox is the type of leading actor who sucessfully demonstrates that he can and is not afraid to share the limelight with other actors.

Extras for this season include a retrospective featurette by the cast and crew: they are also contributing to fond memories about this perpetually awesome series. And Michael J. Fox and Gary David Goldberg themselves provided a seminar to what was then the Museum of Television & Radio. It explained how the creation of this series successfully came into fruition between the two of them.

Please, please, cast your vote for this release so we get (at least) all the seasons with Mike elected into production--and on the market!",1225756800,17,4737,5.342281879194631

3523785,5,B001D2WUDE,"Although I wasn't old enough to enjoy the show on its first run, I've made sure to allocate time to watching any and all re-runs over the years. Eventually I decided that I'd like to be able to watch it on my terms, as many times as I'd like, and therefore decided to pick up this DVD for Season 1.

Focused primarily (mostly) in the New York City Mayor's Office, Michael J. Fox, along with an incredible cast, work to help out New Yorkers, put out political ""fires"", and develop relationships over the course of the season. The show is very obviously a comedy with sarcasm, satire, puns, put-downs, and every other type of humor utilized in-between spurts of important dialogue and deeper emotions surrounding events such as ongoing romances and hot political topics such as gay marriage (civil rights) and workers compensation.

I've not found a boring/dull episode to date and the show is a fantastic pick-me-up. Sunny days, rainy days, horrible days...pop in the DVD and relax (and laugh)!",1407110400,,993,4.8011695906432745

3523800,4,B001D2WUDE,"By the time ABC's Spin City debuted on Sept. 17th 1996. Superstar Canadian-American Film & TV icon Micheal J Fox, had already been diagnosed & living with Parkinson's disease(A devastating & progressive neurological disorder that leaves some with it as  virtual prisoners in their own bodies.) for at least 5 years!

He'd also battled Alcoholism(related to the despair that often comes with an illness like Parkinson disease.)

Additionally, he also struggled in the early 1990's with a botched film career(Save for, the Back To The Future Trilogy,The Secret Of My Success, Doc Hollywood & late in his run on Spin City,the Dec. 1999 Blockbuster Stuart Little.)

So Spin City marked a major comeback for a film/TV vet. Who'd been through a rough decade up to this point. From the very first Episode of the series, you get the idea that Micheal J. Fox doesn't give up easily. The Show really was his to carry. Although his supporting cast-mates do the absolute best to keep up with him.

The Show is all about Micheal J. Fox's comeback to the medium that made him a star in the 1980's with Family Ties.

Highlights/Standouts of this first season include: The Pilot, Dog Day Afternoon, Criss Cross,Meet Tommy Dugan, A Star Is Born, Grand Illusion, The High And The Mighty,The Great Pretender, Bye, Bye Lover & several others.

To Sum Up Spin City: The Complete First Season is simply Micheal J. Fox at his best,Period.",1395100800,4,1415,4.846473029045643

3523824,4,B001D2WUDE,"I've been going through some of the TV shows I remember in the 80's and 90's, so I finally got to this one.  I purchased the first four seasons since I liked it when Michael J. Fox was in it, and didn't really care for it after Charlie Sheen arrived and Michael left.

If you're a Michael J. Fox fan, it's a fun show.  Very vintage ""him"", which works great in this show, which is one reason I don't think Sheen worked for me when he took over after MJF left.

It's always fun seeing shows from the pre-cell phone days, a world in which the technology we take for granted now doesn't exist...

Alan Ruck was always a riot in here, his smarmy character so much fun to watch.  Richard Kind plays a character reminiscent of the one he played on Mad About You.  Connie Britton is always a pleasure to watch.

The stories sometimes can be a little one dimensional, the various arcs through the episodes pretty quickly resolved, but still a fun ride.",1350950400,6,943,4.318181818181818

I didn't bother watching all of Season 1 as it seemed a waste of my time.",1305763200,,328,4.174603174603175
3523828,2,B001D2WUDE,"I never really cared for the show when it was on, and realized that the creators of Family Ties were the same as Spin City. I found humor in some small things but others i just found to be to forced like Fox and cast were just reading various cracks off cue cards. Fox is the best in the show, as expected but he just seems like he's trying to hard to be the clever Alex P Keaton, economical, political suit wearing boy we all know and love. His character as Mike seems very confused and feels like he can't quite find his niche'. Alex was one of the most if not the most notable character to come out of 80's sitcoms, therefore i guess its hard to compare them. All in all the show isn't horrible, but i've got to admit the writing just isn't very good. Also i'm not all about the homosexual movement and i disagree with it totally, and there is far to much of that in the show as well, and 80% of the show revolves around sexual humor. Its ok after a bit, but is a bit overkill at times, the good thing about Family Ties it was one of the few shows that had limits and was very original and a good family show for everyone. Sure it had some cursing, sexual inuendos and such but it was with some class, and tact. I understand the show got good ratings because of Fox, but without him is was a utter disaster as Charlie Sheen showed us later on. Also trying to compete with Sienfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond was next to impossible, so an E for effort, but as i said i just really didn't find the show that funny. Maybe a chuckle here and there.",1280880000,3,1548,4.112211221122112

The first season is really good, and really funny, with Michael J. Fox as the perfect choice for Deputy Mayor of New York, Mike Flaherty.

Although the first season was very good, it wasn't quite as great as the other MJ Fox seasons, as you get the sense that many of the side characters were still trying to find the right mix and tone for the show.

Spin City Season 1 is a funny and admiral start for a show that goes on to shine as one of the 90's best sitcoms, along with the likes of Seinfeld. It's just a shame that the quality ended with the absence of Bill Lawrence and Michael J. Fox.

8291445,1,B001D2WUDE,"Sadly, I just just had a chance to view this last week.  Right out of the package one of the discs was defective.  Looks like I've been cheated out of a bunch of episodes because Amazon website says I can no longer return it.  I am very disappointed and will be limiting my purchases in the future.",1462492800,,298,4.192982456140351
