No secrets, very open about they offer-if you want some good basic tips for a daily driver (I did) that will work well and be cost effective, this is it.  Daily driving for me, and I want my personal (and work car) to look good without the need to purchase specialized/imported waxes, etc...",1365465600,2,323,4.649122807017544
8450851,5,B005084DUA,"I knew absolutely nothing about detailing cars before buying this DVD. My beloved car sits outside since we don't have a garage. I wanted it to look like it did when it was new, but the detail service at the car wash quoted me $350 to detail the whole car! I can't afford that, so I searched Amazon and found this DVD. I liked the fact that the host was also a woman, and thought what do I have to lose?

You should know that this is a VERY enjoyable DVD to watch. The young female host, Alex, is very personable and fun to watch. This DVD never feels like an ""instructional"" video. Alex gave me the information I needed to make my car look better than I ever thought possible, and she entertained me along the way.

Alex is very thorough, she told me exactly what products to buy and where I could get them. Alex told me how I could do the job as inexpensively as possible, and also where I could upgrade equipment in the future. Her tips are spot on, and she even explained things to me that I'd never have known otherwise, like what polish and wax actually are.

When I had ordered everything I needed, I took my time and followed Alex's advice. She walks you through EVERY step you need to take, I never felt like I didn't understand what I needed to do. And wow! My car looks even better than when I drove it home from the dealer years ago. I feel so empowered now, thanks to Alex I undertook something I never would have tried on my own. She made this complete beginner feel comfortable doing things I never imagined I could. I cleaned my engine, interior and made my paint look like new.

Oh, and be sure to watch the bonus outtakes. Alex is a charming young lady and a couple of the outtakes had me laughing out loud.",1318723200,3,1725,4.218181818181818
8450852,5,B005084DUA,"I'm so glad I bought this DVD. I don't normally write reviews on products, but this was so enjoyable and helpful, that I want others to know about it. And I hope there are more DVDs from Alex in the future.

I had hand polished and waxed cars before but I wanted to learn more. When I watched this, Alex hooked me right away, her story is great and she's so good on camera she should be a TV host or something. With her advice, I bought my first random orbit polisher (I bought the more expensive of the two she recommended). I followed her instructions and used a clay bar on the paint (I had never even heard of this before), and then polished and waxed using some of the products she recommended. She is not selling any particular brand, she gives you several alternatives for any step you're on. My metallic red Lexus looks like it's just been painted, it actually has that ""wet"" paint look to it. I never achieved these kind of results before.

I totally loved the leaf blower tip. I got one like Alex recommends at Sears and it works just like she says. My neighbor thought I was nuts at first, but when I explained it to him, he bought one for washing his car too LOL.

This video is well done, it moves along quickly never leaving you thinking they're dwelling too long on anything. Yet, they spend enough time so that you understand and feel ready to try the techniques. There's a couple of places in the video where the lighting could have been a little better, but overall the production values are very high for this type of thing.

The bonus feature on headlight restoring worked perfectly for me. That was worth it alone. And OMG, Alex is hilarious in the out takes! I've played them for friends at my house just for laughs. Make sure to watch them.",1318636800,2,1763,4.349544072948328
8450853,5,B005084DUA,Alex and Richard did a very good job of putting this Detailing Guide together.  I've always wanted to detail my convertible GT Mustang but didn't have time to give my car to a detailing shop nor wanted to spend a ton.  The information this DVD provides made me realize that I could detail my own car and I could do it as often as I want.  I've already started gathering most of the products they recommend and I feel good about being able to benefit from their knowledge knowing I don't have to experiment with all of the products out there. The tire foam in the engine compartment is so simple and makes sense but I would never have thought about it nor would I have had the nerve to try it without knowing it would do no harm.  I'm excited to try and bring my Mustang's shine out like Alex's Magnum or Richard's 03 Cobra.  Thank you for the information and additional advise for the convertible tops.,1311552000,2,902,4.345238095238095
