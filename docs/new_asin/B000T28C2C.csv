8643287,2,B000T28C2C,"I made this purchase based on the assumption that the film would be the original full-version of Marching On.  However, the film on the video is the cut-version which was re-released as ""Where's my man To-nite?""  The original supposedly had a long scene of a troop train arriving on the Southern Pacific siding at Ft. Huachuca Az in 1942.  This shot would be of historic value but I fear the cut footage is now lost.  Westlake Entertainment was very prompt in sending the video and mix up on the film labeling was the fault of the DVD manufacture and NOT Westlake.",1391644800,,564,4.554455445544554
