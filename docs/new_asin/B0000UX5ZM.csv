Seven ""out"" gay comedians are featured in a June 2003 concert in Santa Monica CA, telling their personal and friends' ""coming out"" stories.  Featured are Rene Hicks, Dan (""Real World - Miami"") Renzi, Bob Smith, Terry Sweeney, John Riggi, Sabrina Matthews and Jackie Beat.  Production quality is above average for comedy compilations, though I've heard better material from most of the comics involved.  Probably best suited for a group dealing with coming out issues.",1071187200,5,558,5.306818181818182
