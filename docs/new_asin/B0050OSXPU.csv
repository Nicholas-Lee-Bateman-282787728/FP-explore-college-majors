8451593,4,B0050OSXPU,"I will never cease to be amazed at how documentaries about the Second World War still manage to find a new angle to make the subject matter fresh. Thats exactly what DEAR UNCLE ADOLF manages to do.

The world has learned that it is simplistic to excuse the rise of National Socialism in Germany by saying Hitler was a monster. If so, how can the allegiance of an entire country be explained?

If one believes, rather, that Hitler was a man who did monstrous things, the answer becomes more believable. The inherent discomfort of such a statement, however, begs examination. That is the premise of DEAR UNCLE ADOLF.

Hindsight is always 20/20, but how could anyone at any time describe Hitler as avuncular? Yet an entire country worshipped him as their saviour. Men wanted to emulate him, women wanted to bear his children and the children wanted him to be their uncle.

The material for this film came about when a secret Russian archive was discovered containing some 100,000 letters written to Hitler by the German people. Only a very small percentage of these letters were critical. The majority were fan letters of the most extreme kind.

The sheer charisma of the man is evident from the words of admiration and love that pour forth in these letters. Surely Hitler was a gifted manin oratory, politics and manipulation. The fact he used his abilities in the pursuit of absolute evil is perhaps the greatest blight on the 20th-Century.

The value of this film is that it serves to remind us that when such an individual comes alongand Hitler is by no means the only onesociety must never allow them absolute freedom and blind loyalty. Accountability even at the highest level of class, celebrity and achievement must never be allowed to slide.

DEAR UNCLE ADOLF is full of archival photos and footage showing Hitler interacting with his adoring populace. It is incredibly unsettling to see children, especially, revering their dear uncle the way most children revere Santa Claus.

Hearing the actors voice reading the letters (as well as seeing the actual handwritten pages) adds to the viewers discomfort.

Whats more, the letters are presented pretty much chronologically, through Hitlers rise to power to his downfall. The unswerving loyalty of many of the letter writers is deeply unsettling.

DEAR UNCLE ADOLF is a necessary addition to anyones library of films about the scourge that was the Third Reich.",1397433600,,2414,4.9236453201970445
