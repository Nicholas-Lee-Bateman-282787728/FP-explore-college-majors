8352446,4,B0026BD2KQ,My husband was born during the great Depression and lived as a child through it.  He was interested in watching this film and it reiterates what my husband remembers and was told about in his young life.  A documentary that is worth watching if your interest is in what the depression really looked like in real people's lives.,1371340800,3,327,4.620689655172414
8352447,5,B0026BD2KQ,"If you want to see The Great Depression exactly as people experienced it, this DVD is for you! This documentary is essentially a collection of short films all designed to show us how people struggled to make it (or didn't) and the quality of the print is very good indeed. The DVD comes with an excellent CD of Depression-era music--and even a thirty-two page booklet!

Just a few of the short films I found particularly interesting include the effects of the dust storms and the flooding on the economy--and people's lives--during The Depression; and there's some fascinating footage of a textile worker's strike with a lady giving strikers a pep-talk using all her might! The sound on the footage of the textile strike could be a little better; I didn't understand everything the lady said. Nevertheless, the camaraderie amongst the workers was quite clear and I liked that.

Other captivating footage shows ""The Tub"" soup kitchen run by ""Mr. Zero;"" although it was his critics who named him ""Mr. Zero"" the fellow was smart enough to embrace that name and make himself and his soup kitchen famous--so famous that they were feeding and clothing many more men than they otherwise would have! They started at five o'clock in the morning and stayed open until seven each evening, first serving oatmeal with unlimited bread and coffee for breakfast and then soup (not ""dish water"") for the rest of the day--again with all the bread and coffee the men wanted! We see what eventually happens to ""Mr. Zero"" but I'll leave that out so I don't spoil it for you!

Even big stars get involved helping the less fortunate. Fanny Brice and some chorus girls in a show they were performing knit sweaters for the poor; that was really terrific work. We also see a young lady selling the only thing she really had left, a chinchilla coat which she says she purchased for twenty-five thousand dollars. She also offers financial advice for anyone who has any money left.

There's so much more but I'll stop here to avoid spoilers. I agree with anyone who says that the music on the CD is wonderful, too! Together this documentary on DVD and the CD truly capture the essence of The Great Depression. The booklet is well done, too. I highly recommend this DVD/CD/booklet set for anyone studying The Great Depression; people who appreciate historical documentaries with social and cultural themes would also do well to get this for their collections.",1345680000,11,2429,4.817745803357314
8352448,3,B0026BD2KQ,"Was interesting, but we liked other video about the depression that we ordered better.  ('The Great Depression', and that one was longer and cheaper.)  It did have a couple of short movies at the end that were worth watching.",1302912000,4,225,4.743589743589744
8352449,5,B0026BD2KQ,"Again as an educator, this is just another teaching tool for me; I wanted my students to experience that era so I TOOK THEM THERE! And once again when they put their thoughts on paper, I could plainly see they enjoyed the educational trip.

I suggest to many educators out there, if you want to really get your point across about any topic - don't just say it with notes, show it and then discuss your notes; you will not ""lose"" one student's attention - trust me on this.",1286928000,14,472,4.303370786516854
8352450,5,B0026BD2KQ,"Wow..amazing stuff here..it is rare to get a chance to see clips like these uninterrupted by narration. You truly get a sense for the era and people..this dvd is  like a time machine that will hurl you back to that amazing era. Apparantly many of the clips included in the set have never been released in any form as they were newsreel out-takes that were not even seen back in the day...
For anyone who really wants to experience what that era FELT like..check this DVD/CD out...and the CD is fabulous..just the tune THE PANIC IS ON is worth the price of purchase!",1269648000,19,565,4.485436893203883
8352451,5,B0026BD2KQ,During my first view of this DVD I was surprised to see someone who I think is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn in the episode on the textile strike. Other sources say that she was there in 1934 as well as every other important labor dispute. If so it is an excellent and rare clip of the woman who is at the top of my list of most admired people. Anyone watching please take note of this dynamic woman.,1249948800,6,393,4.116883116883117
