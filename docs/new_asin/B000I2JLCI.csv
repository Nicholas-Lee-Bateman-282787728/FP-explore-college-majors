8143713,1,B000I2JLCI,"I recommend that no one purchase anything from this seller. I bought 2 copies of the Leann Rimes Complete DVD collection but only kept one. I returned one on December 7, 2012 and have yet to receive my refund. Because this seller is overseas, the USPS cannot track the package. On December 9, 2012 it left Chicago on it's way to the UK. If anyone decides to by from this seller, I hope you don't have to send it back because you will never receive a refund. I don't hate the product, I hate the service from RAREWAVES. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. I'm just glad it didn't cost me that much to learn a lesson. This is the first and only seller I had a problem with. I had other videos sent to me from out of the country and wanted to return them because of the sexual content involved which the video was for the kids. They didn't only send me a refund, they also told me that they didn't want the video back and then sent me a free kids video. This is a great seller that wants to keep customers. Maybe Rarewaves should take lessons from this seller. I give this seller (2) two thumbs down",1363737600,,1110,4.191588785046729
8143714,5,B000I2JLCI,"Leann Rimes is the person that got me into country music back in 1996 when Leann released Leann's debut album ""Blue"". I was so amazed to hear that this voice I was hearing on the radio was coming out of a 13 year old! It was love at first sound, and that my friends is how I got into country music. Like other reviews on here, this DVD is not really complete like its title suggests since it is missing a few videos, most notably the Coyote Ugly videos but I guess they're licensed by the movie studios (it probably explains why the 2 songs from that movie were alternative videos here). But I'm still so glad to have a DVD of Leann's videos! This is an excellent DVD as it has 19 videos going over an hour of pure hottie Leann, and if that's not enough you get more Leann in interviews and making of video. Only down side is that this DVD is a Region 2 so make sure your player is compatible.

8143715,3,B000I2JLCI,"I don't get why LeAnn is primarily an American star and yet they only released this DVD overseas.

Anyway, a couple of things, there are videos missing:
Written in the Stars
Can't Fight the Moonlight
Some People

Can't Fight the Moonlight was a big disappointment. It's LeAnn poorly lipsynching the song. They might as well have left it off the DVD all together.

But overall, it's nice to have her videos on a DVD. I hope they come out for one in the US...one day",1222646400,,464,4.435294117647059
8143716,5,B000I2JLCI,I just purchased this DVD through Caiman and it was very quick service and received it as described. Although it's a Region 2 DVD but it does work on my computer. For people who really want this DVD please check your computer to see if the DVD player option is selected to region 2 on your DVD selection menu and click on United Kingdom and then update your selection and it should play and mine works beautifully.,1210032000,2,414,4.3896103896103895
8143717,4,B000I2JLCI,"I think this is a great DVD. I was a little bummed that the music video for 'Some People' wasn't included. I also expected the music video's for 'Can't Fight The Moonlight' & 'But I Do Love You' would be from the ""Coyote Ugly"" movie. Of course it's still worth having for the LeAnn fans out there!",1162944000,3,297,4.228070175438597
