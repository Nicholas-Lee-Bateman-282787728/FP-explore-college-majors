3496557,5,B001BNSHZ0,"Great, less hysterical, mid period Zulawski about an independent woman who tries to make it in the world of acting, amidst the usual exploitation one goes through to express themselves for commerce. She is sandwiched in a crazy bisexual love triangle between two psychotic male actors, one who thinks he's hitler, and the other who might as well be Hitlers boyfriend and is some some of political freedom fighter! Valerie Kaprisky is a sexual stun-gun, she appreas naked for large chunks of the film and has a booty that great artworks are based upon - including this film!

Mondo Vision has presented this film in an eye-watering print, you get a Zulawski commenatary and 15 minute interview. The disc itself is pretty much like your standard Blue Underground presentation, modest though not chock full of extras. The packaging of the disc itself is the kicker. Whilst this is only the 'sepcial edition', you get a digipack encased in solid carboard box with a little ribbon to help extract it from it's sleeve. Full colour thickish booklet with lots of intellectual essay work on Zulawski. My copy had little tissue paper insets to protect the booklet! This disc is a collector-scum's wet dream!

Seriously in a depressed market, the fact that Mondo Vision have gone to this length to present a fine intellectual obscurity like this, in such a presentation is cause enough to vote with your pocket and purchase it! It's worth every cent!",1246233600,10,1439,4.89344262295082
3496558,5,B001BNSHZ0,"Utterly briliant package with a wealth of extras sure to satisfy any true fan of Zulawski's. Great film, beautiful transfer and timeless commentary by Zulawski. Well worth every penny.",1237075200,6,184,5.379310344827586
3496559,3,B001BNSHZ0,"All the reviews rave about the Director, cinematography, soundtrack, etc., but all I saw was bad acting that couldn't be saved by the non-erotic nudity.",1236124800,,152,5.12
3496560,5,B001BNSHZ0,"I watched this newly released DVD and enjoyed it tremendously. I watched it several times and learned more with each viewing. This movie does not have the routine ""happily ever after"" ending that many viewers like. It may even disappoint some people; however it is, in my opinion, a masterpiece by Andezej Zulawski, a Polish director. This 1984 movie was made in the era of the political unrest in Eastern Europe. In this movie a young director( Francis Huster) hires a beautiful actress( Valerie Kaprisky)to play a role in his movie. This Young actress has been trying to get on the big screen and into the film business without much success. For survival, she has been dancing nude for a photographer who exploit her. The movie is a mixture of suspense, violence, exploitation, paranoia, sex, nudity and political plots. It was based on Dastoyevsky's ""The Possessed"". The conclusion is left to the viewer since Zulawski leaves the ending open to your interpretation. The screenplay is written by Dominique Carnier and modified by Zulawski. It could be assumed that part of the character of the director in the film is Zulawski's own character and the story is about making a movie, similar to 8 1/2 by Fellini and the Player by Robert Altman. Viewer may need to review the movie for several times in order to appreciate Zulawski's artistry and talent. I certainly learned more each time I saw it.

It ts introduced by Mondo Vision to the Market with a very attractive packaging, a useful booklet and an interesting interview with Mr. Zulawski.

Congratulation to Mondo Vision for producing a superb art piece as their first product into the market. This version with clear English subtitles will add to Mr. Zulawski's fame. the new viewer gets a chance to know and learn about this controversial director.

A must see DVD, to learn and enjoy this masterpiece of film making. Wish the best of success for Mondo Vision and I hope to see more work from this compant.

3496561,5,B001BNSHZ0,"Wow! The transfer of this film is amazing! Prior to last night I'd only seen LFP on a murky Canadian vhs rental and an equally dark (visually - the story is another matter) Asian dvd release - both sans subtitles.  Even with inky shadows and soupy colors I was so taken with this film - the story, the direction and the performances that I signed up for this release the day I got the Amazon notice!  Now, finally seeing LFP as it was originally intended, I am amazed at how much the overall impact of the film is intensified - and LFP is pretty high voltage even in half-light!

Previous reviewers have laid out the storyline, so I'll omit a synopsis of Ethel's journey to her big break as an actress.  Suffice it to say, Zulawski is a master at taking what is essentially an over-the-top story, setting it in a specific historical context, and then making it chillingly real.

As to the extras, the essays and transcribed 1984 interviews (what tipped me to the premium ed) are fascinating and well worth the extra cost.  Interesting to project on where many of the principals are now compared to their comments made almost 25 years ago.

Zulawski's commentary and on-camera interview give the viewer a glimpse into his attitudes and philosophy of film direction as well as specifics about making the film and creating an adapted screenplay. Interesting for film buffs; invaluable to screenwriters.  The soundtrack is a stand alone bonus I didn't expect to enjoy this much.  Now it's on my favorites play list.

There is no fluff here.  The Premium Edition is crammed with great stuff not the least of which is a fabulous transfer of a truly intriguing film.

Way to go Mondo Vision... so what's next?",1227052800,5,1702,4.655518394648829
3496562,5,B001BNSHZ0,"La Femme Publique (The Public Woman) (1984) is the story of aspiring young actress Ethel (played by the stunning and versatile Valrie Kaprisky), who by accepting a role in a film based on Dostoyevsky's 'The Possessed', directed by controversial Czech filmmaker Lucas Kessling (played with icy cool and raving madness by Francis Huster) is sucked into a world of manipulation, political conspiracy and confusion.

There are many subplots in this film and the line between reality and acting is blurred for both Ethel and the viewer, but this doesn't detract from the beautifully composed shots, visual style and colors or the film itself.

This was the first film I've viewed by Polish director Andrzej Zulawski and it has left me impressed. I'll definitely be seeking out more films by him.

Video/Audio:

The Hi-Def Anamorphic film transfer (approved by Zulawski) retains the film's original 1.66:1 ratio and was undertaken by gifted UK videophile David Mackenzie ([...]) and it is a visual feast - clean, vibrant, film-like (grain!) and overall - amazing. The audio is crisp and well-balanced.

Supplements:

Commentary with Zulawski
An interesting interview with the director where he talks about, among other things, co-writing the film with the Dominique Garnier, author of the original novel.

Package:

Here's the other area (besides the film transfer) where this DVD really shines. The Premium Collector's Edition packaging is absolutely gorgeous. It is black box with red holo-foil stamping, great artwork, 10 B&W photo reproductions (with their own envelope), a Certificate of Authenticity (ltd. to 2000), a CD soundtrack (track list is included) remastered by composer Alain Wisniak (I am a huge fan of DVD sets that include this) AND a glossy 48-page booklet featuring an essay by Daniel Bird (who moderates the DVD's Commentary) and interviews with the director and cast members from 1984. Best of all the whole package fits on your DVD shelf next to all your other standard clam shell cases (it's only slightly larger overall).

Final Thoughts:

This is a perfect film for fans of unconventional/drama/art house/indie/foreign flicks. Thank you Mondo Vision, this DVD set gives Criterion a run for their money. Here's hoping for more quality packages from this company. I only wish more films were treated this well.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

8283900,5,B001BNSHZ0,"The story is a little plodding but the dance scenes are just tremendous, especially when the guy has a heart attack just from watching. Buy it, she's really pretty and very comfortable being nude, almost like she was born that way.",1471910400,,231,4.658536585365853
8283901,3,B001BNSHZ0,"This is a movie about this woman who just begain a career as an actress and also has a relationship with the director.
 It is quite vague between the moviemaking shots and the reality which is the relationship between the actress and the director.
 Valrie Kaprisky played the roll of the young actress who just started the actress for movie who is also a nude model for still camera and Lambert Wilson played the director part who is just a mad, immoral bad case of director like man.

This director reminds me of David O. Russell, you know who the guy made movies like <Silver Linging Playbook><American Hustle><Joy> and so on. He is very notorious dealing with actors shouting, almost molesting actors/actresses on set.
 The director in this movie also does the same. He shouts even pushes the main actrss to make her cry, make her panic to death. He doesn't know how to make her really understand what her roll is or try to find her way of dealing with her inner being for the roll by herself. He doesn't understand that the actors are the other artist at all. He just think that they are robot who just have to follow his order without any questioning.
 He also seduces the actress outside the set having sex almost like pushing her to undress her.
 He is the worst case of worst director of them all.

The movie is obscure between what is real and what is the shooting the movie moment. But if you concentrate enough it is not a problem at all.
 This movie also reminds me of another film <SNAKE EYE> by Abel Ferrara which is also a movie about making movie. It is also very vague and there is almost no line between what is real and what is about movie making shot. Madonna and Harvey Keitel starred in that movie.

ANYWAY, last word about the movie, the very last shot, all the actors are gathered and vowing towards the audience. What is that? You know what. It maybe means even the whole actors and the actor who acted as a director are all acted. Which means movie inside the movie inside the movie is this movie. Comfuesed? This movie is about making a movie right? But even after the movimaking is done, it is still movie making since the actual camera is still rolling. Only the real director is not in the camera who is Andrzej Zulawski. All the others are in the actual camera thanking to the audience for watching the movie LA FEMME PUBLIQUE.

The reason I bought this dvd like 7 years ago is of course because of his movie <POSSESSION> the most provoking horror/ surreal movie of all movie that is in this world.
 Alien, mutation, psychopath, love triangle, sexuality, tension bwtween one woman and two men, the crazy acting of Isabelle Adjani. It was just made me want to see the director's other movies.
 But sadly I haven't found any good movies yet. His other films are just so aweful.

<PUBLIC WOMAN><IMPORTANT C'EST D'AIMER><MY NIGHTS ARE MORE BEAUTIFUL THEN YOU DAYS><L'AMOUM BAROQUE> They all are just waste of money.

Valrie Kaprisky is a beautiful actress and it is hard not to fall in love with her especially when we see her posing in front of the light naked and dancing around in front of the still camera as a model. She was so natual as a model herself.

We all know that the director Andrzej Zulawski worked with all the beautiful actresses in France include Isabelle Adjani, Sophie Marceaue, and so on. And among them Isabelle Adjani, Sophie Marceaue were his lovers. and also has a son with Sophie Marceaue without marreage.

He had a strange life and made strange movies. It is a great surprise that he was able to make 15 movies include two shorts in his life.
 He was a happy man.
