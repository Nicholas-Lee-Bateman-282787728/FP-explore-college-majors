6602573,5,B00MVH75VW,"As a teacher for many years, I can say this is a great video to watch. You don't have to be in the NFL to know this offers a unique approach that is not found anywhere else, at least to the general pubic. Unlike other instructional videos, John Carney uses multiple kickers and punters to demonstrate technique, skill and style. He covers a large scope of topics including equipment and specialty kicks. Maybe the most useful part is where Carney shares a checklist for troubleshooting field goals and punts. As someone who is very health and fitness orientated, I found the section on strength and conditioning fantastic and informative. John Carney has proven himself successful at every level of the game. This video is a treasure for all punters and kickers who can now tap into his foundation of workout exercises that produces results.",1410220800,,841,4.847222222222222

I have personally worked 1 on 1 with John for 2 years now and I have never felt more confident in my kicking and physical training. This DVD covers from the most basic kicking/punting drills to game day preparation. He has learned through trial and error and is now sharing his knowledge with us.

6602576,5,B00MVH75VW,"A+++
This DVD by John Carbey is an amazing tool to teach the art of kicking and punting. I have been in the NFL for 9 years, I won Super Bowl XLVI and had the game of my life. I have trained alongside John Carney in Carlsbad CA for the past 8 years. There is no better mentor for kicking, punting, or weight training. I not only give my full endorsement of this DVD but more importantly the man who made it. John Carney played for 23 years in the NFL and went to the pro bowl at age 42. What more needs to be said. He is one of the greatest kickers of all time.
