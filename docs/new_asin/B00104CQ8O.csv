8390123,5,B00104CQ8O,Ive never played the game of one pocket and found the dvd very good - the audio and video quality does suck but we must look at the time of recording.,1336953600,,150,3.870967741935484
8390124,1,B00104CQ8O,DVD definitely not worth the money -- very pooly done -- video and audio less than amatuer..Tip's would be good if could get past the noise and poor video--Total waste of my money!!,1239753600,,181,4.515151515151516
8390125,4,B00104CQ8O,"I bought the VHS version of this dvd a long time ago.  I had wanted a DVD version and am glad that I finally have it.  When I bought the DVD, I didn't realize that it was the same because of the title.  With the DVD, I am able advance to the shots I want to study more about.

I gave this a 4 star rating because the production quality is poor.  If the presentation and quality of the video were better, I would have given it 5 stars.

The shots are advanced and many of them are useful.  I am always amazed to watch the shots being executed.",1204588800,2,542,3.9174311926605503
