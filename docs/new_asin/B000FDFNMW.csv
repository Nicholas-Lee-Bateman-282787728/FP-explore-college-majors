8598113,5,B000FDFNMW,"I have followed the career of Santiago Restrepo since he was an assistant at Saint Louis University.  His passion for the game and his facility with teaching make a powerful combination in teaching the game of volleyball.

Coach Restrepo's main emphasis in teaching the game is in defense and passing.  This DVD emphasizes the defense part and it is a dandy.  The coupling of blocking and back row defense is a natural because it is beneficial to teach the coordination of the front row and back row defenses.

Coach Restrepo is a tough task master when it comes to defense because he firmly believes in the adage that defense wins games.  This DVD is a distillation of his many years of coaching and study on the defensive game.  This is also an excellent teaching tool for him to deliver the proper techniques of both blocking and defense.  No matter who you are, player or coaches, at the high school or college level, this DVD will help you in understanding the intricate coupling between blocking and defense and the proper way to train the proper motor skills and reaction cues for the game of volleyball.

The only down side with this DVD is that it does not truly show the passion and personality of Coach Restrepo in action.",1183161600,2,1233,4.645161290322581
