Though they stand on their own, it was features Herman shined in. True he works with no budget to speak of, but no one working today can take a small budget and make it work. Herman does this by providing everything a movie should have... a good story. Don't look for exploding cars, you won't find them. But if you want an engaging story, some good suspense (and a healthy dose of TNA) this is sure to please. I stand by what I said years back, ""Herman shines in the feature length format"".  Looking forward to his next release. Welcome back, Phil!",1289520000,,690,4.348837209302325

Granted it was low budget  but were it lacked in budget strong charector devolpment and a well thought out script maed up for it.
I really was absrobed by all the twists and teases I received. Everytime you think you have thisng figured out something new is thrown at you. There is a thin line of what is real and what is fake.
This movie will not have you on the fast forward buttin at all. A story that keeps you guessing till the end holds your attention.
Ontop of that the very attractive cast (Especially the lead) keeps you watching.
I hope this group makes more movies they are a godsend to this level of movie making. They understand what the fans want and dleivers the goods. T/A suspense and excellent music and editing make this stand above the rest!",1265414400,,932,4.235955056179775
