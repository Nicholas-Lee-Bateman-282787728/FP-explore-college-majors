8508863,4,B0072GOIX0,"In spite of the cover, I wouldn't classify this as your standard dance movie. Dance is there but mainly as a catalyst for other things like love and keeping promises.  Intelligent dialogue and good acting by an attractive cast who give it their all.  Nice extra touch that it takes place in Italy and looks it--rich colors and deep shadows, passions, blood brothers...with a beautiful soundtrack that pulls it all together.",1335830400,2,423,4.943661971830986
8508864,1,B0072GOIX0,This movie claims to be a movie about a man's struggle between his two loves....his girlfriend and dance. well he must not love dance too much because you never see it in the movie. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.,1335484800,,227,4.3023255813953485
8508865,4,B0072GOIX0,"Although packaged as a dance movie, and offering its share of original dance, Crew2Crew is not your average dance movie experience. All of the standard devices are here--small town nobody gives up everything to go for his dream, struggles to prove his worth to a hardnosed choreographer, then achieves success at last. But in this movie, based as it is on a true story, they are played out in a totally unpredictable way-- real people have real lives, real loves, real commitments and a whole load of emotional baggage that they can't just dump to fly off to some permanent state of stardom. Of course, against all the odds Luca makes it, just like every other dance movie hero. But in this case ""making it"" doesn't get rid of those big questions like who he is, what he wants his life to be and what he is running away from. Those questions are all still right there even after Luca's dream comes true. And the story doesn't end until he answers them.
The location of the movie --Southern Italy in the fall--is a million miles away from your standard American inner city. Instead of bright candycolor and urban grit, we get chiaroscuro, big empty theatres, dramatic shadowy closeups and warm Mediterranean glows. And a beautifully nuanced soundtrack with musical passages not normally associated with a hiphop dance movie. Being set in Italy, you know the story line will be more than just filler between dance numbers--there are passions flaming, odds to settle and promises to keep that go way beyond the dance drama.",1335312000,2,1520,4.783269961977187
8508866,1,B0072GOIX0,but it never does.  There are very few dancing scenes and the main character does the same move over and over.  The crux of the story is belabored throughout the entire movie.  Absolutely disappointing.  If you like b-boy dancing you won't find it here.  If you want to watch a drama with little dancing and is ultra-slow; than this is the movie for you!,1335139200,2,354,4.46875
