8532487,4,B008YD4U9W,"Glastonbury was a challenge for U2 in 2011, as they were used to performing in the gigantic claw.  Here, they strip it down and start the set with five songs from 'Achtung Baby'.  The rain pours down and the band braves the weather just like the audience.  This video is from a BBC recording and it appears be from a Portuguese television broadcast.  There is a 5.1 audio track, not particularly dynamic but effective enough, and the DVD is bare bones, with barely a menu in sight and no extras.  But the price was cheap and the performance is very special.",1412812800,,557,4.475247524752476

U2 - dvd - Live At Glastonbury 2011 . I got this dvd and it isn't any good at all... it said it was used, I was okay with this.. I believe the person I got this from.. must be buying dvd and burning them over an over,to resale..it plays but the sound is crap and the picture is fuzzy...I'm really tired of being took by sellers who just don't care what they are selling.. only thing they care about is getting money while they just kemep selling crap to us....",1409097600,,470,4.064516129032258
