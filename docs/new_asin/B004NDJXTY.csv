4435725,5,B004NDJXTY,"Thank God for Youtube and DVD reissues (like Irish Tour 74 and much more, available on Amazon), which means everyone can see all this stuff live, the intensity, the lyricality, the virtuouity, the joy, the humanity. The reactions are pretty much the same ""Why did it take me 20 years to find this music? Why is no-one doing anything like this now?""  I lost track of Rory after 1977, when we'd spent Thursday afternoons bunking school to play pool and listen to Irish Tour 74. Clearly the sad folk at Rolling Stone lost their way too, when they compiled their list of 100 great guitarists and somehow left Rory out!!! But in 100 years time, when the great guitarists are rollcalled, Rory will be up there with between Hendrix and Duane Allman and whoever else the gods bless and belabour like this.",1310688000,8,797,4.612676056338028
4435726,5,B004NDJXTY,"This DVD is a great look at an under appreciated guitarist. It shows Rory for what he truly was a man happy traveling the world and playing his music. Unlike musicians today with a vast line up of guitars. Rory is seen mostly playing a battered Fender. A guitar that has seen many a mile on it. Yet still performs every night much like Rory himself. There are scenes interspersed within of Rory and the band backstage pre- and post concert. Which shed a light on a different time in the music business and its technology. Included among the extras are some performances of Rory in Japan. Despite the language difference good musicianship is still universally appreciated as is caught on camera in the short bonus footage.
Well worth the price as an introduction to Rory's music a must if you are a fan!",1307404800,6,802,4.576388888888889
4435727,5,B004NDJXTY,"Tony Palmer, the director of this film (and it is a FILM, not a video) was in 1974 the premiere director working in rock, especially in Europe.  Previously Tony had worked with everyone from the Beatles to Cream to Pink Floyd.  He chose to highlight Rory Gallagher's annual Christmas tour of Ireland at a time when ""The Troubles"" were at an all-time high.  Rory was virtually the only rock musician of any stature who would play in Ireland during this time, AND he played both Dublin and Belfast.  Yet such was his stature in his native country that Rory was considered 'off limits' to terrorist attacks.

Politics aside, this is a marvelous film.  Rory was peaking and his performances, especially on ""A Million Miles Away"" and 'Bullfrog Blues"", are incredible.  The audiences are beyond ecstatic, and at times it reaches an almost religious fervor.  Curiously, politics are never mentioned.  Rory talks about growing up and his influences and demonstrates on his acoustic and his dobro.  There is plenty of dressing room footage to show what a focused individual he was when it came to his music.  And the music has Rory smoking, the absolutely best blues rock player ever on the planet.

In addition, the transfer is an improvement on the older DVD, and the sound pounds, as it should.  There are some great extra features, including a wonderful and touching commentary by his brother and manager, Donal Gallagher, and his long time bass player Gerry McAvoy, the two individuals who knew him longest and best.  A short 30 minute feature for Irish TV from 1972 is also included in spectacular quality, and features some more interviews and performances that are also high quality and worthy of inclusion.  And there is some home movies from the Japanese tour from shortly after the completion of the film.

While Rory had a long and magnificent career, and the recent documentary ""Ghost Blues"" does an excellent job of covering that, ""Irish Tour '74 highlights the bond between a committed artist and his rabid fans in a way hardly seen outside of Beatlemania, and does so in outstanding visual and audio quality.  Nearly every performance of his is worth checking out, but if I had to pick only one, without a doubt this is the document that shows the magic Rory performed before an audience every night he performed.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Blues-The-Story-of-Rory-Gallagher-the-Beat-Club-Sessions/dp/B003XMKN7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Blues: The Story of Rory Gallagher & the Beat Club Sessions</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rory-Gallagher-Live-at-Montreux/dp/B000FG65TE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rory Gallagher: Live at Montreux</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rory-Gallagher-Live-at-Rockpalast/dp/B000SNNTVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rory Gallagher: Live at Rockpalast</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rory-Gallagher-Live-In-Cork/dp/B001R4SYYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rory Gallagher : Live In Cork</a>",1305072000,31,3097,6.148491879350348

The picture is now in what seems to be its correct widescreen aspect ratio and dramatically improved....this is like comparing a remastered Beatles CD to one recorded through a pillow case...its that much better even on the standard DVD and the Blu-Ray is wonderful!  There is also a bonus half hour documentary on Rory that features another batch of great performances...seriously this should be a no-brainer for fans of this gifted musician.

The question is...do I upgrade..YES!

If you love seriously wonderful electric blues..YES
If you are a fan of Rory Gallagher...what are you waiting for?

I do need to add that there are several great Rory Gallagher DVD compilations on the market now from Rockpalast to Montreux that have more performances than this film....but this is a film and an artistic one which really takes you into the sweaty clubs of '74 Ireland and backstage which is a treat. Of course the film maker is an artist and he does show sweaty faces instead of fingers and guitars and does add shots of Rory during songs that may make visual sense to him  but are obviously NOT the song he is playing as his guitar is changed and the slide is missing etc...but its very creative and fun.",1303430400,19,1486,5.379310344827586

Not that they aren't interesting, you just can't hear them. You'll need to turn it up to hear what's being said, but then be prepared to turn it down when the music comes back in.",1411430400,2,344,4.149253731343284

4435735,1,B004NDJXTY,"I have no idea what any of the people are talking about saying this is a good video. This is probably the most poorly done guitar video that I have ever seen and unfortunately wasted money on. It was even purchased at a guitar type store. The whole thing is weird creepy close ups of his face. They are so close they even cut the top of his head off. You keep thinking he's going to bump his head on the camera.....it's so much of a close up that it's that comical and SAD. Please save your money. They show his head for what feels like (and may be) about 5 minutes then 16 seconds of guitar.....just part of it not all of the guitar......then 5 minutes of his head again and then the top of the guitar......then minutes of his head again. ""Stupid"" is the only word I can describe the video production. It's like a woman or a guy who was in love with the guy directed all the footage and editing. It's that bad. Honestly I have NO IDEA what anyone is talking about here giving this garbage a good rating. If you are an actual guitar player and want to see how great of a musician he is.......you won't.  A great musician like this deserves better.",1404000000,3,1147,4.213636363636364
4435736,5,B004NDJXTY,"Hearing Rory play anytime, anywhere is always a treat. Any version of ' A Million Miles Away or Tattoo'd Lady' I will listen to several times. 'Pistol Slapper Blues' and 'Bullfrog Blues'  are two of his funniest songs & demonstrate, not only his extensive guitar playing, but  that Rory had a whacky sense of humor. I see why Hendrix called him the greatest. It is a bloody shame that so many have never heard of him. I can add this one to Rory Gallagher: Live at Montreux. If you are a Rory fan, I recommend having both in your library.",1399939200,2,537,4.36

4435743,5,B004NDJXTY,"Rory is an idol of mine, and seeing this fly-on-the-wall doc was a great way to see how he really might've been on the road. He measures up to be the humble but assured person all biographies claim him to be. There is of course NO shortage of great tunes on this either - I even picked up my instrument and played along during several parts.

If you're a blues fan, watch this movie. If you play guitar, watch this movie. It's a must-see.",1361404800,,438,4.214285714285714

4435745,4,B004NDJXTY,"I liked the video very much, only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the how the video begins with Rory playing ""Walk on Hot Coals"" towards the end so you don't get to see the song from the beginning which is one of my favorite songs and some of the best quitar playing of anyone. Listening to his music over the years I believe from 72-75 was his best music and there weren't many musicians better, seems like and video I've seen or Rory he's given 110% on every song, concert, etc.",1355788800,4,484,4.159574468085107

4435747,5,B004NDJXTY,"This is a glorious DVD. Being a 50-year-old geezer who is the self-appointed minister of rock culture in my house and family, I am forced to bludgen my son and his high school friends over the head with ""the best music"" that they missed out on due to their age. And when I do expose Rory Gallagher's catolog to the great unwashed, I am always asked, ""Why wasn't Rory Gallagher popular here in the states?"" I don't have the exact answer but it may have something to do with Rory not being a pop act the way Clapton was. Clapton was great at playing the blues but most of Clapton's successes were pop songs. Rory never went near the pop idiom; pure stripped-down blues rock. Same with Robin Trower. Neither of those guys turned out any pop turnes.

So enough of my silly rant! Pick this DVD up immediately and see a true artist!",1343779200,,826,4.363636363636363

8436612,3,B004NDJXTY,"It hurts me to say, because I love Rory, but this video leaves much to be desired. It is filmed in the crappy style of D.A. Pennebaker. Video shots of audience or totally unrelated scenes are what we get. Excuse me if I prefer shots of the main focus of the entire video. This problem is common among video directors and it's a pain in the a$$. I want to see Rory's fret work but sadly we have little of that. While the music in this video is fine the camera shots are not. Please directors show the subject of the film actually playing. Rory was a phenomenal guitarist show him playing PLEASE!",1521244800,,594,4.265486725663717

8436614,5,B004NDJXTY,"I grew up on The Who, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Hendrix and the Stones and one regret I have today is that I never took the time to follow Rory Gallagher. I got into him around 1977 but didn't stay and follow his career forward.  That HUGE mistake is on me,  so I am desperately trying to cover my tracks and I am now getting my hands on everything this rock/blues legend released. I started with Irish Tour '74 and it's off the charts! Absolutely amazing and the musicians are incredible.  This band does not take a back seat to any of the all time great rock bands such as the ones I mentioned above. Over the last two months I have watched hours upon hours of Rory Gallagher videos on You Tube and there is no one and I mean NO ONE who performs live like this guy. I have watched Irish Tour '74 three times in the last three days and it get's better each time. What I have found about Rory Gallagher is he plays every song as if it is the last song he will ever play. The opening song ""Walk On Hot Coals"" makes you feel the sizzle and heat and he's just warming up!  All of the songs will blow you away with how tight the band is. My personal favorites are the bluesy ""Million Miles Away"", followed by the foot stomping , clap your hands mesmerizing mandolin piece ""Going To My Hometown""  and then the band rocks the pillars off their foundation with ""Cradle Rock"".  What a supporting cast to Rory with with Gerry McAvoy on bass, Lou Martin on keyboards and Rod de'Ath on drum. This concert, this dvd,  the whole aura surrounding Irish Tour '74 is one for the ages. Absolutely freaking amazing!!!",1513468800,2,1598,4.271523178807947

8436618,4,B004NDJXTY,"This review is from the Quello stream, not the DVD, so I'm not going to speak to the video or audio quality or content because that may vary depending on the medium.  A quick review for the Rory fan, considering the time frame it was filmed, it's not a bad video.  As one reviewer pointed out, if your looking for an instructional guitar video, this is not it.  Though I'm not a student of guitar, I love a great guitarist and was a little disappointed, but one has to take into consideration the time frame.  It wasn't meant as a focus on Rory Gallagher's guitar techniques, it was a snapshot of a Rory tour.

If you've never heard of Rory Gallagher and are a fan of old, blues based rock guitar, then that's a shame and you definately owe it to yourself to pick up some Rory stuff.  This film is not a bad place to start.  Every classic rock guitar fan talks about the Beck's, Clapton's, Hendrix and Page's.  If you are a real fan of great classic guitar rock, you'll go the the next level of popularity in artists and might mention the Alvin Lee's, Paul Kossof, Peter Green's, Robin Trower's and perhaps others I can't think of at the moment.  But you pretty much NEVER hear of Rory Gallagher and that does a disservice to  Mr. Gallagher and the fans of guitar rock.  Was he the best?  Greater than?  Did he blow away other guitarists?  I think that's all B.S. and unnecessary.  He was a great guitarist.  Who can say who is better, it's all subjective.  Better technically?  Better feel for the blues?  Better emotion?  Better, as in faster?  Garbage!  He was great.  Not better than, not second to any.  How I would personally describe Rory?  The emotional feel of a Koss or Alvin Lee.  At times the restraint and subtlety of Koss.  Other times the manic explosions of Alvin Lee.  You can hear some of the blues rock sounds of Hendrix, Trower and later with Vaughn and sometimes he plays the old school pure slide blues of the early Chicago blues men.  Rory Gallagher is one of the greats from his era with a lot of emotion, energy and feel.  The only negative I can say about his music...  you will never find yourself saying ""Hey!  Cool!  I never knew that was Rory Gallagher!""  If you haven't heard of Rory before, chances are you won't recognize any of his songs short of a cover of a blues standard.  That's my one complain, his songs were short on hooks.  That being said, he still deserves a listen if you're a fan of any of the previously mention guitarists.",1482969600,,2471,4.401330376940133
