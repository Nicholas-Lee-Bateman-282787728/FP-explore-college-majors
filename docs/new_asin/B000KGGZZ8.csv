2690692,4,B000KGGZZ8,"I bought this DVD for my sister as a gift because the 1978 version of The Promise is on it, and this is one of my sisters favorite flicks, though I couldn't tell you why. There's not a single car chase, gun battle, kung fu fight, explosion or beheading in the whole flick! ;-)",1172016000,,276,4.12962962962963
2690693,5,B000KGGZZ8,These movies were excellently done.  Great characters for the parts and following well with Ms. Steel's books.  I loved her books and the movies were great to beable to later see and enjoy visually.,1171929600,7,198,4.794117647058823
2690694,5,B000KGGZZ8,"The DVD was excellent all 4,keep you looking forward on seeing the next one. Also it was a good price for getting 4 movies. Would like to see more of the same type.  Keep making more of Danielle Steel's DVD'S.

2690695,5,B000KGGZZ8,"This collection of movies from Danielle Steel is quite a treat, including the movie The Promise starring, Stephen Collins bka ""Dan Broderick"" from the famous A Woman Scorned, and a very young and stunning Kathleen Quinlan.

PALOMINO: After seeing this one I wanted to inherit a ranch and fall in love with a handsome farm hand!!!

Secrets: Reminds me of the days when prime-time soaps ruled! I truly enjoyed the fantastic ensemble cast, which includes a very handsome Christopher Plummer! That man has aged so well!!!

Star: Eventhough this love-triangle roots for the main character played by Jennie Garth, I really liked and felt sorry for the second choice wife, played by the very beautiful Terry Farrell. I remember her from the tv movie and short-lived series Paper Dolls.

The Promise: This is a bonus movie included that's well worth watching, about a young couple very much in love, but a horrible accident tempts their fate.

This dvd set is a must for any Danielle Steel fan or if you just enjoy watching great tv movies minus the long commercials. I  rarely watch Lifetime network anymore because their commericals are so long (5 minutes or more, I counted). I'd rather buy the movies on dvd! I just wish some other classic tv movies would get released on dvd in the US like Lace, starring Phoebe Cates, Deceptions, starring Stefanie Powers, and Mistral's Daughter!!!",1169856000,50,1379,4.896995708154506

2690794,4,B000KGGZZ8,"I originally bought this DVD for the called The Promise because I had recently  seen it on Netflix. I watched the other movies and I enjoyed them very much. Palomino is a story about two men who would rather have an affair than marry the women they love based on a belief that other people will look down on them or call them gold diggers for marrying women who are wealthy. What they don't seem to understand is that their coworkers know that they are sleeping together. I won't tell what happens to the two couples. all I will say is that the movie is worth watching. Star is about a guy and a girl who meet by chance at a barbecue and are attracted to each other but the girl is to young for him at that time, meanwhile he finds another girl that he is attracted to and is about to marry her when he runs into the girl he can't forget and he tries to break off his engagement but we later find out that this girl only cares about appearances. There are a series of events that bring them in and out of each others lives and the ending is well worth your time in watching the movie. Secrets is well, about secrets of course. Christopher Plummer is wanting to shoot a TV series/soap opera and he has already picked the people he wants to star in it. One lady is in an abusive relationship with her husband and she needs to go back to acting so that she can provide for her daughter and leave her abusive husband. Another lady comes from a wealthy background and doesn't want anyone to know it. The other lady is a former actress who once had an affair with the Plummer character and also has a son from another man and she desperately needs the money for her son. The men also have their secrets too. One has been set up by a woman who makes a living setting up and bribing people. One man has a wife that has a severe drug problem and he is always bailing her out.",1407715200,4,1866,4.154696132596685

2690803,5,B000KGGZZ8,"Another purchase for my sister. In the early years I LOVED reading Danielle Steel books. Now they all seem like rewinds. But the movies. UGH who can get enough of Palomino???? Cowboys will break your hearts?? Or will they??? Secrets- Doesn't everyone have secrets???? Star-Everyone wants to be one..... The Promise has been one of my favorite books since I began reading Steel. BE PREPARED while the Cast is AMAZING. This is one of her first movies I think, its from the late 70's which is fine. But the MUSIC... If you can get into it and have a good time like we did you are golden. I am glad I watched it but it's probably a one time deal... LOL",1384732800,,648,4.363636363636363

The movie is from the 70's and for some this was too long ago but for others it was a trip back in time for the setting but the story line never grows old.

I had streamed it a few times on Netflix and while their widescreen copy was very clear, I figured the DVD must be even better (it wasn't available on Blu-ray), and had been searching for it for several years.  Well, the copy of that movie in this package is just awful!  While it is spread across my entire 55-inch widescreen, parts have been cut off at the sides (for example, you can't see the pins when Collins knocks them over at the fair), there's some awkward pan and scan, and the picture is far from clear.  Which means that I spent $12.49 for something I could have watched with far better quality for free.  What a waste!  I realize that Universal lists ""The Promise"" as a ""BONUS MOVIE,"" but what about those of us who only buy it for that movie?  I think we should be warned about what we're getting!  And I don't blame Amazon one bit for this.  [Follow-up:  Amazon generously refunded all my money on this, no questions asked, which was a relief!]",1359936000,24,1061,4.479166666666667

However the movie ""Star"" is just as good, maybe better.  The other two films I saw one of, and yet to watch the other.
Secrets is about the Hollywood scene, a new soap opera and how the lives of the actors almost mirror the show they make, sometimes wilder.

Star is about a young lady in her her late teens, who met and fell in love with a older man. As they go their own ways, she becomes a popular singer and makes films and he married a lady and involved in politics, yet they never stopped being in love with each other. Anything more will spoil it.

The Promise
a lady artist and young man wishes to marry. his mom is not for it. On the day they plan to wed a accident forces them to take a different path. She has to have an operation that will replace her entire face, giving her a new look. nearly a year later they meet again, and he is unaware of it.

2690898,5,B000KGGZZ8,"I have always been a closet Steel fan, and enjoyed the translation of her books and novellas (she wrote the movie novella The Promise.
The stars in her Tv films have always been well cast and the film versions of her books hold up very well.
Rather than review each film in this set, let me dote on The Promise. Kathleen Quinlan as Nancy/Marie was an incomparable beauty in this film, a simple tale of two lovers Nancy and Michael Hillyard (played by Stephen Collins)torn apart by a horrific car accident and a devious mother, well played by Beatrice Straight. Nancy undergoes extensive plastic surgery after being disfigured ( at the expense of Michael's mother-with the proviso that she gives up Michael). She does so, believing that Michael will seek her out, not knowing he has been told that Nancy ""died"". A tale of true love, though incredibly sappy, good scenery of San Francisco, fine performances and a good score serve the film and the story well. I once ran into Stephen Collins and talked with him about his career and he advised that he got more positive feedback about his role as the bereft and mourning Michael Hillyard than any other role. Interesting, hmmmmm? Anyway, the price point of this set for the four Steel films, with The Pomise included as a special attraction makes it one of the real bargains out there.

2690903,4,B000KGGZZ8,"The ""palomino"" is actually the flax-tressed Lindsay Frost as a recently divorced photojournalist who sets her sights on a hunky horseman played by Lee Horsley. More flannel-tearing than bodice-ripping, the bosoms still heave as shutterbug and cowboy begin a hot-n-heavy affair among the Quarterhorses and haybales. Tragedy strikes and the suds lather, but Palomino is a well-done weepie for romantics who also like horses. There's a nice subplot involving therapeutic riding for disabled children. Based on a novel by Danielle Steele.

2690909,4,B000KGGZZ8,"I'll probably be asked for more reviews. I think you can evaluate them better if you could consider them in the persective of my tastes, character and personality. In view of this may I introduce myself to you, to Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.de?

I am a Maltese Maths teacher nearing retirement. I always made maximum effort not to suffer from a conservative mentality and I don't get along bad with people of any generation. My favourite challenge is trying to understand people's feelings, and empathise them. I do my best to discourage marriage separation and divorce with people in marriage crisis and strive towards reconciliation. It is perhaps the reason why I hold in limelight of my collection Erich Kastner's film ""Das doppelte Lottchen"" (The Parent Trap).

I enjoy practically all types of films including hard pornos, nudity and hard sex, so long as they have good scenery and a convincing plot. I cherish in such films with a good, sentimentally musical background. However, I hate and really hate films that dwell on violence and bloodshed.

The Promise.

I rated this film very good because it brings out the spiritual power of love between two persons. The lady was disfigured after a terrible accident and had to submit to plastic surgery which completely changed her face. Although her former fiancee had no idea now who she was, he felt himself mysteriously attracted to her. This mystery puts one aware of a life reality which one rarely even thinks about but which one ""treasures"" once one is made conscious of it. Along with a somewhat rich scenery and musical background this film gives the positive message that love survives even through impossible situations. The acting was good and it is a film that one sees over and over again.",1174348800,6,1753,4.892255892255892
