8162239,5,B000LMPNL8,"One of the best pieces of Dutt during his glorious action hero period. The movie is one of the best masala films with a wide range of genres nicely tied...
Baba's (Dutt) journey as a Son, a Brother, a friend, a loyal employee and an anti-hero who does what is needed to keep his from harms ways.. true inspirational for the 1st borns like myself..
Great action, music score, story, and Dutt and Raveena at their peak is just a treat.. some under used jewels like Kadar Khan, Tanuja, Ajit and Gulshan Glover... a really young Atul and Karishma.. Over all a great movie with strong relationship values as well as the results of Karma vs Dharma to some extent.
It has some similarities with a Better Tomorrow (1986) but this one as all Sanjay Dutt and Dupta movies is a way better version for Indian public.
The more you watch it, the more you enjoy it.. 2 VHS cassettes and a DvD have been worned out during the last 20 years.",1525910400,,924,4.377906976744186

Towards the end, you will be trying to figure out why the good guys ARE the good guys, and why the BAD GUYS are BAD.

Aidtya Pancholi is a fine actor for sure; but you can't REALLY see him in the realm of Hindi cinema; his real place should have been on an 80's American cop serial. Agul Agnilhotri is also a great actor; but he's a gentleman rather than a brash show-off, so he was never destined to true stardome.

Baba (Sanjay), his younger brother (Agul) and Nawab (Pancholi) are, for sure, the good guys. Raveena and Karishma seem to like 'em... and they get along well with that nice funny man (Kader Khan), but ultimately you feel more sorry for Gulshan Grover's criminal character than anyone... sure, he's a bastard, but, I mean he gets his own son killed, and, like he's an underworld don, so a bit of retaliation, is like, expected.

Ultimately, a bit of a hero-worship action flick but good to watch.",1383609600,,1002,4.429347826086956
