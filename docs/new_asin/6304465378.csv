885506,4,6304465378,Classic Italian humor at it's best. Yes there is some nudity and some sexy scenes (along with marching band music) A recommended movie!,1168646400,3,135,4.913043478260869
885507,4,6304465378,"I remember that when this film played in theatres here way back when, the newspaper ads included the proviso that, due to the explicit nature of the film, photography was strictly prohibited.  ""Who's going to take photos of a movie?,"" I thought.  I figured it was just a gimmick to play up the sex in the film.  I also imagined that Ursula Andress' career must have really gone downhill to have participated in a trashy quasi-porn film like this.  Having recently watched the DVD, I can say that I was right about the amount of skin seen in the film (especially by '70s standards).  The nice booklet that No Shame Films provides with the DVD also explains that Andress was no longer on the A-list of actors as she had been.  What I was wrong about was the film itself, as it turns out that it's quite enjoyable and fun to watch!

Leonida, the patriarch of the Bottacin family of wine producers, is in a bad way.  He's just had a heart attack while in bed with the local gravedigger's wife - and his family couldn't be happier.  Nieces Jole and Italia, nephew Gustavo and (especially) Italia's husband Benito can't wait for the old man to kick the bucket so they can make a deal with American gangster Mr. Kitch to go international.  The trouble is that Leonida won't go so quickly, so Benito hires Anna, his sexy former nurse (and bed mate) to quicken the old boy's pulse and cause a second, fatal heart attack.  Add in Jole's son Adone (the only relative who wants the old man to live), Giovanni (the frequently drunk servant) and Tosca (whose services to the family go well beyond cleaning and cooking) and you've got the makings of lots of mayhem.

Besides Andress (whose scenes include a nice nude swim), the cast is lead by Duilio Del Prete, doing a lot of physical comedy in his role of Benito.  One of the highlights is when he tries to show Anna the 'proper' way of caring for Leonida to do him in - to which she replies that he may die laughing.  Mario Pisu is funny as Leonida (especially in his final scenes), Carla Romanelli is quite delightful as Tosca, while former Bond girl Luciana Paluzzi (""Thunderball"") joins in the racy goings-on with a topless scene.  Jack Palance also has a few short scenes as Mr. Kitch - and it's rather evident that he enjoyed himself in the process!

The picture quality on DVD is good, enhanced for widescreen sets and filling the screen.  The video box says that the proper aspect ratio is 1.66:1, which would mean that a bit had to be trimmed from the top and bottom to fill the screen, but I couldn't notice anything missing.  There are two soundtracks, Italian and English, and I chose to listen to the Italian with the optional English subtitles.  Though the subtitles are easy to read, I found myself going back a few times to re-read them as some went by too fast - a small price to pay, as I always prefer the original language to get the proper feel of the film.  The DVD also includes interviews with director Nello Rossati and his brother Tony, the costume designer; the trailer; a poster and still photo gallery; and an informative 8 page booklet (the norm for No Shame releases) which is such a rarity these days.

As that booklet states, "" 'The Sensuous Nurse' will never be mistaken for a remarkable film but it does have its charms.""  I wholeheartedly agree.  While it's not a classic by Fellini or Antonioni, the film is a lot of fun, with enough laughs and amusements to bring a smile to your face.",1162857600,20,3460,4.483253588516747
885508,4,6304465378,"If you don't mind subtitles this is a great black comedy. Ursula Andress is beautiful both in and out of her clothes. She plays a lady who is employed by a heart attack victims family to ""nurse"" him back to health. But actualy require her to ""finish him off"" using her natural charms. Unknown to the supposed victims family. She has a plan of her own. Well worth a look.",1151625600,8,370,4.3

7872357,5,6304465378,"This is an old Movie totally silly but out of print and getting more expensive all the time. If you are a fan of Ursula Andress like me I would fork out the cash while it is still available and buy it. I remember watching Ursula in Dr No and fell in love with her, I was probably around 8 or 9. Then the next Movie that I remember She was in ""She"". ""She who must be obeyed"". That was the Movie that is still my favorite she ever did. I watched the Sensuous Nurse many years ago, probably on ""Beta"" and thought it was stupid and it pretty much is. But the only real reason to watch this movie is to see Ursula running around in her Birthday Suit! She is a real beauty. I would suggest if you are a fan get the Movie before it disappears.",1454371200,,736,3.946308724832215

7872361,3,6304465378,"The Sensuous Nurse.  I did not purchase the movie but have seen at least three versions.  In one Luscious Lucy has a close up of her full breasts and in another just a flash of her bare breasts.  In one, the elder man dies while in the saddle and in another he dies while the nurse is taking her clothes off.  Italian movie makers apparently saved all the out takes and made many versions.  You can not be sure what you are getting.",1357344000,2,432,4.156626506024097

They just don't make good erotic movies like this anymore ! Nothing but raunchy hardcore stuff nowadays! Should be released on Blu-Ray!",1338595200,2,308,4.517857142857143
7872364,5,6304465378,"Ursula Andress is so sexy and hot. I really enjoyed watching this movie. I love Italian movies, and I love watching Ursula. I think she is considered one of the few hot women in the world. I think there are five great and hot movie stars Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda, Sophia Loren,Brigitte Bardot, and Ursula. She is as hot as the Italian hot beauty Sophia Loren or the French hot beauty Brigitte Bardot. She looks hot and acts great too. It is one of the best Italian Movies. It is a comedy movie, and also it is an erotic movie. If  you like Ursula, you will enjoy it too. There are some nudity and sex scenes in the movie. It is really good movie.",1170115200,9,648,4.225806451612903
