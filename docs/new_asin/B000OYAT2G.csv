2802370,4,B000OYAT2G,"Do you know the name of the song in the opening credits? If you love Anna the way I do, you will appreciate the movie...for just that.....a movie. But as far as covering her actual life, not so informative. It ended before it began, and had huge gaps all along the way. Sad really, I wanted a Bio! I can only hope that someday someone else will take her life and her attributes a little more seriously, with an informative, factual film. AND SERIOUSLY!!!!! Does anyone know the name of the song played in the opening credits? Half country, half club mix! Catchy, but invisible! Please help me! I'm going crazy!!",1263168000,3,611,4.513513513513513
2802371,1,B000OYAT2G,"If you want a well made film with decent acting look elsewhere. It is really understandable that this took two years to come out and came straight to DVD quietly. Anna deserved better and the lead (Ford) was not a great choice, her talent as an actress is slightly above the Hills cast members, with less class (but to be fair Heidi is giving her a run for her money). If you want a campy movie- rent it or look on-line. Not funny enough, even as a campy movie to want to see it more than once.",1255132800,11,494,4.103092783505154
2802372,3,B000OYAT2G,"Where do I start with this movie? The title of my review pretty much says it all. I don't want to talk down about this movie for the simple fact that I am a huge Anna Nicole Smith fan, and I am happy there was a movie made about her. BUT this movie is not accurate AT ALL. It left out way too much! I do think Willa did the best of her ability as playing Anna, I just don't think they gave her too much to work with. I hope someday they will make a better movie for Anna, one with a better budget. One of the things that ruined this movie for me was the tacky music! It was horrible! I did like the last scene of the movie, I won't spoil it for you who have not seen it. But it does make it seem like Anna is in a better place now and finally at peace. RIP ANNA WE MISS YOU!!!",1255046400,8,776,3.709090909090909
2802373,3,B000OYAT2G,"I like Willa Ford for who she is, she did a good job with the voice and the jibbery way Anna sometimes talked.
The video didn't do much detail in certain events in her life, by passed the funeral, all the trials, the weight gain, just fast and not very detailed.  It mainly focuses on the relationship between Anna and Daniel.  I am a big fan of Anna Nicole and even though I'm just glad some movie came out, maybe some bigger company will realize the possibilities of a movie and sink some major money into a project!",1254182400,6,518,4.275510204081633
2802374,4,B000OYAT2G,"This movie has been a long time coming. I remember seeing (Willa Ford) on (Dancing With The Stars). Shortly after her appearance on that show, she started work on this movie. I'm not really sure why this movie was never shown at the movie theaters or on TV? - lol - After 2 years, it's finally coming out straight to DVD. I'm sure this movie will be as much of a train wreck as Ms. Smith's life. I'm also sure that it will be thought of in the future as a cult classic. That's why I'm buying it. From what clips I remember seeing on (Entertainment Tonight), It seemed like Ms. Ford did a good job impersonating the look and sound of Ms. Anna. I can't wait to receive this DVD in the mail, so I can experience it for myself. Even if its bad it will be good. Just like Anna Nicole herself. Don't get me wrong, it's very sad how her life ended. There is nothing funny about that. I'm just saying that she was larger than life and I'm sure this movie will be the same. How could it not be? If you didn't know it was a true story, you would think that it had to be fiction. I give it 4 stars just for what it is - A fun trashy movie!!!

UPDATE!

I thought I'd add to this review after watching the movie.-lol-

This movie mainly suffered from a bad script. There was far to much drama in Ms. Anna's life to cram into one 90 minute movie. Here are a few of the films problems. There was no mention of her first husband or any of her family. Her relationship with her mother would have been interesting. It also showed very little of her partnership with (Howard K. Stern). No reenactments from or any mention of her movies. Not even her embarrassing speech at the music awards. Very little shown about the fight over (Howard Marshall's) money. (Willa Ford) did a fine job with her performance especially in the second part of the movie after Ms. Anna gained weight. I don't know where the films producers were trying to market this movie. It surly wasn't of major film quality and was way to racy for mainstream TV. Since this film wasn't rated, I was surprised that it had nudity and colorful language. The tackiest thing about this movie I thought, was that (Bobby Trendy) took the role of playing himself. I still think Ms. Anna's story would make a great movie. This just doesn't happen to be it. Either way it's still a fun trashy movie.",1253664000,5,2336,4.2686230248307
2802375,3,B000OYAT2G,"ok but after a while you feel explotative watching this.i want item on anna nicole,and it may be that i know she's not profitting from this. I feel as though I should let her rest, as I'd want mine after passing. Another pretty face to be marketed and sold.",1192579200,2,257,4.26530612244898
2802376,3,B000OYAT2G,"I bought this dvd not relizing it was a slide show of her pictures to music. I have alot of those pictures from the internet and other sourses. Many of the pictures are durring the same event and a little redundent. There are ofcourse, some really great shots that were on the dvd I had not seen, but I wish it was done better, with better quality, then it would have been great! I feel as if they thought, hey let's get it out now while the hype is on to get the most money. I wish they took more time with it. Still I recommend it for any Anna Nicole fan, just know what you buying, A slide show with music tribute and Not a video style tribute, then you won't be disappointed.",1181952000,10,679,4.074626865671642

2802380,2,B000OYAT2G,"The script was horrible. I think I watched only 11 minutes of the film on Youtube.com and had to stop watching because it was that horrible. The only good thing about the film was the fact they had some decent music in the movie, however, you can't even find the music and from what I heard there is no soundtrack available for the movie. Save for the music, avoid this movie at all costs.",1388707200,,389,4.27027027027027

2802383,5,B000OYAT2G,"Bring your crying towel for this one. Willa Ford is excellent as the poor desperate stripper, formerly Vicky Lynn Hogan, who meets oil tycoon Howard Marshall. There is a touching chemistry between the two of them. He offers to rescue her by hiring a nanny to care for her son, Daniel, and proposes marriage while encouraging her to believe in herself. She is chosen to model for Playboy and life tumbles from that point on. Daniel becomes addicted to Zoloft without a father to care for him and the constant barrage of media attention given to his mom. I just wish a few more details could be covered in this quickie TV picture and a less of a heavy handed G-rated edit used in terms of relationships. Very sad and a real tear jerker.",1332892800,7,734,4.485074626865671

2802385,1,B000OYAT2G,"This movie is awful! I recently bought it at Movie Gallery and I wish I hadnt. The biography part is pretty much dead on but I hated that parts where the ""dead"" Anna was popping up and telling the viewers how much the world was crazy because of her death. Oh please, Anna Nicole Smith was and is the last thing on my mind. Let alone her death.",1275264000,,343,4.0588235294117645
2802386,1,B000OYAT2G,"I love a bad b-grade movie, but this was absolutely atrocious. Anna Nicole Smith's entire life squeezed into about 80 minutes. This movie jumped ahead so quickly you could barely keep up with it, (which actually, considering, the production, and acting, may have been doing us all a favour). I have never heard of Willa Ford before, and I don't think I'll be searching out her movies in the future, although I have to admit that bar the early scenes in the bad curly wig, she does look quite a bit like Anna Nicole. I was never especially a fan of the woman, but I was hoping for some insight into her life beyond the superficial, and this movie barely even touches on that let alone anything deeper. The older man she married is portrayed as a kindly old thing with barely a hint of the actual relationship they had, her son Daniel goes from child to depressed teen in about five minutes. Too compressed, not well written, and not even worth a watch as a guilty pleasure.",1273968000,14,972,4.466292134831461
