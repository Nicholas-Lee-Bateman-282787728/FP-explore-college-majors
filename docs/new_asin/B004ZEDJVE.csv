4507831,4,B004ZEDJVE,"If you like a film featurimg hot men and peek into the world of male exotic dancers and their struggles to get money and get love then this is the film for you. While the film features plenty of eye candy for the ladies, and some for the men, viewers will be delighted in seeing aspects of the downside of male exotic dancing and the struggles of trying to give up the street life for a more legitimate means of paper chasing aka earning a living.

 Clifton Powell, although minorly featured, still has it.  I've been looking at this guy for as long as I can remember.  Thomas Crawley gives a great first effort and shows a range of emotion with his character Brian aka Luscious.  Kudos to lady director Deidra Thomas, we need more women behind the camera as well as in front.

This film is sexy, humorous, at times sad, and has a bit of surprise ending.  Definitely worth buying.",1314489600,42,880,4.395061728395062

4507857,5,B004ZEDJVE,"I bit sketchy,but good.slow to follow.
Written by a woman, I wonder if a male could've told this story? Interesting flip on a industry that's primarily been about women.
Liked it! Sistahs check it!",1362096000,,197,4.823529411764706
4507858,4,B004ZEDJVE,This is definitely not a major production but the eye candy alone earned this film 4 stars. The plot could have been better but the casting was on point.,1360713600,,153,4.310344827586207
4507859,3,B004ZEDJVE,I was expecting more with this movie-particularly the acting and the strip scenes.  The story itself was not bad though.,1359331200,,120,5.0
4507860,3,B004ZEDJVE,"I gave it three stars only because the characters are fine and sexy.  It left me with to many unexplained situations, for example,  the promoter who used drugs when he gotten kidnapped or the people that murder his brother.  There were other gaps in the story that did not add up.",1357862400,,280,4.450980392156863

4507864,5,B004ZEDJVE,Was good a little long on the story line but entertaining.  I can say this movie too i thought would get deeper into the issues of each character. Good eye candy if that what your looking for.,1356048000,,192,4.1891891891891895
4507865,3,B004ZEDJVE,"The movie was not the best but it had some good moments. The music was synchronized with the scenes and some of Thomas Crawley's performances was awesome! The story line really wasn't that strong & some of the acting was amateur. It could've been a lot better, nevertheless T.Crawley did an outstanding job playing a male dancer.",1353283200,,329,4.7894736842105265

4507868,1,B004ZEDJVE,"I guess I should have paid attention to some of the reviews concerning issues with the tape.  The DVD comes completely sealed and looks okay, but did not play in either my laptop or in either dvd player. I am not sure if anything is on the actual disc.  This will be the first return for Amazon for me, but not sure what I will do after this as far as obtaining a copy for my collection.  I was able to see the movie via the Redbox.  An interesting film, but soured because of the delay and issues with the product.",1346025600,,515,4.069306930693069

4507872,4,B004ZEDJVE,"Great movie, kept me interested the whole time.  I would definately recommend it to anyone that wants to watch a movie they will not be bored watching!  Great quality also, I wasn't sure what to expect and I was so pleasantely surprised.  By the way, I met Thomas Crawley AKA Lucious years ago at the club Chit Chat in Atlanta (where it looks like most of the movie was filmed).  After watching the movie I wonder is this his true story.  Since his true stage name is Lucious and he truely at the time I met him he was a male dancer.  If it was or wasn't a true story I think he did great in the movie, it was very insightful into the male dancer life.  I'm just sad I didn't call Thomas Crawley when he gave me his number, let me know if you remember.  You handed me your number while you were working (dancing over me as I sat in Chit Chat), I was a little nervous (never been there before) since I never had the time to go back we never saw each other again.  Great movie!!",1337472000,,976,4.0680628272251305
4507873,4,B004ZEDJVE,"There are absolutely no redeeming aesthetic qualities in ""Shake"", if we leave aside the exceptionally good-looking, hard-bodied, virile black men who parade across the screen in various stages of undress. It's still an interesting cultural document on several levels. One is how it demonstrates the process by which the dominate thread in Hip Hop has declined from its early incarnations as fun and as spontaneous forms of social critique and protest by and for young people of color in the cities, into the degenerate mainstay of the culture industries that sustain consumer capitalism and its values among the young of all backgrounds today. ""Shake"" shares this characteristic with much else, however.

What's unique about ""Shake"" is what is less obvious about it - there's a powerful undercurrent of DL homoeroticism here that's directed toward same-sex oriented black men. This eroticism is disguised by the super-imposition of apparent heterosexuality in the many scenes of near-naked, undulating, highly sexualized and objectified black men. At first glance this movie seems directed toward women, especially black women. Black women are the sex (love?) objects and fans of the male dancers who are the stars and are doting supporters who stand by their men. Beneath the apparent, these female presences serve as excuses, perhaps pretenses that allow the viewer to hone in on the men's bodies, sexuality and sexual performances. They are props to black male sensuality, not as love-interests as in movies that are really geared to female audiences. The context of the film is the world of black male strippers in Atlanta, a world that does exist. Yet anyone even vaguely familiar with this scene and related ones in other cities in black America will be familiar with the heavy patronage from black men who like men in this world. Its particular idioms are substantially different from the world of gay white men, and others who identify with the culture they have created, that now defines most conceptions of male same-sex eroticism in America.

This is why the homoeroticism of ""Shake"" is DL. The issue of Down Low black men cannot be properly examined here. Suffice to say that though it includes those who are closeted and conflicted about their sexuality, it also includes those who are not but who are put off by the feminized, upper-middle class and overwhelmingly white public face of so-called gay culture as it currently exists. Think ""Glee"", ""Will and Grace,"" ""Sex in the City,"" etc. The specific idioms of Black masculinity is the appeal of this alternative, for which there is no place in gay culture as it now exists. Thus the avoidance of the term ""gay"" among some black men who will freely acknowledge that other men are their primary object of desire.  ""Shake"" is an exceptionally bad movie, but even a bad movie can be an interesting cultural document once decoded.",1337212800,9,2890,5.067226890756302
4507884,5,B004ZEDJVE,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. IT SHOWS THE LIFE STYLE OF MALE STRIPPERS. FINALLY A MOVIE THAT SHOWS MEN INSTEAD OF WOMEN. YAY!,1336435200,2,119,4.454545454545454
4507885,4,B004ZEDJVE,"Unlike many independent black DVDs out there that are a waste of film and are clearly being thrown together without any real thought put into them, this is a good film & one to watch.  The script is good, the song track is good, of course Clifton Powell the veteran actor is good as well as Crystale Wilson from the Player's Club, and the other unknown but up & coming actors for the most part are also pretty good.  Maybe 2 or 3 of them can use a few more acting classes but they did okay.  As an author who knows a great deal about writing, what I like that Deidre did in this movie besides writing a good script & taking out time to find people who can actually act is that she gave reference & credit to the movie, Player's Club so she didn't come off as a copycat because this movie is similar to the Player's Club from the male stripper perspective rather than the female perspective.  Also, the story line does follow suit with 2 of the strippers using stripping as a means to make money to better their lives in the future just as the stripper character Diamond did in Player's Club. In this movie credit was also given for the name Diamond used in the Player's Club because one of the male strippers stated to another male stripper that the name Diamond used in the Player's Club is the name he should use as a metaphor to show he's using his jewels to sharpen his mind since he is in med school. In closing, the movie was good and Deidre ensured that she gave credit where credit is due and to me that shows she has integrity.",1336176000,12,1536,4.2320819112627985
4507886,1,B004ZEDJVE,"This DVD did not play.  Not in a dvd player, computer or gaming system.  When looking at the back of the DVD I noticed there was nothing even burned to the DVD.

The day it arrived I popped it in the DVD player and nothing, I tried another DVD player  and nothing happened. I thought it was a bad DVD, so I reported it and asked for a replacement. I was ambivalent about the second dvd and I was right to be because it did not work either, not in either DVD player or the laptop. A friend advised me it was a homemade DVD that someone slapped some artwork on to give it the appearance of being authentic. I was and am very disappointed. I am sending them both back. Odd how the disclaimer amazon gives if you are having a problem with the DVD and what to do about it, authentic DVD's don't come with this disclaimer.
