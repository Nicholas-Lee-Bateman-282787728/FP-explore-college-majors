It traces the pervasive influence of corn on modern America, including the obesity epidemic and the fact that Iowa is growing trillions of bushels of *non-edible* corn to continue receiving lucrative government subsidies. College buddies Ian and Curt, both from the east coast, discover that they both had distant relatives from the same small town of Greene, Iowa. Ian and Curt decide to go to Iowa and plant one acre of corn, following it through its lifecycle, including where it goes after the harvest.

The film starts off slowly as the reasons for the trip are explained. The prerequisite talking heads introduce some scary factoids about how Americans are literally made of corn; if you do a hair analysis, it's like a diet diary, and the vast majority of the American diet (corn-fed beef, fast foods and processed foods) contains corn derivatives. Much of the corn we ingest is in the guise of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a cheaper alternative to sugar that is produced via a scary chemical conversion involving several toxic acids.  HFCS has been directly linked to the current obesity crisis and its impact on Type II Diabetes (the body processes HFCS differently from table sugar). Prior to the 1970s, hardly any company used HFCS due to its high cost. But after then-Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz did away with the old New Deal market control policies in favor of rapid expansion in 1973, there was a constant surplus of cheap (and non-edible) corn, fueling the rapid expansion of the corn syrup industry. Here's a quick test: walk into any convenience store and count how many items contain corn, specifically corn syrup. The list includes obvious choices like soda and candy, but you'll also find HFCS in deli meats, breads, ketchup, pickle relish, spaghetti sauce, and cough syrup.  Oh yes, and one main variety of corn grown in Iowa (Liberty) is genetically modified, as is at least one ingredient in HFCS manufacturing.

Corn production geared towards ethanol is briefly mentioned, but the majority of the focus in King Corn is on the impact of non-edible corn on the nation's food supply. In this respect, it's kind of a gentler version of Supersize Me; there's no shock value for the most part. Also mentioned is the disastrous consequence of converting cattle from grazing animals to force-fed confined ones. Cattle normally forage for a plant-based diet, but it is far more profitable to bring them up to market weight by forcing them to stand still and eat continuously. In addition, the acids present in corn cause deadly ulcers for the cows, who are slaughtered before developing acidosis.  The end result is that 70% of the antibiotics in the US are used on livestock (antibiotics combat both the acidosis and the infections resulting from confinement).  Literally everything at McDonald's contains corn: your hamburger is corn-fed, the bun contains HFCS, your soda contains HFCS, the French fries are fried in corn (or soybean) oil, and your ketchup and pickle contains HFCS. Ditto for most vending machine foods, frozen dinners, and anything you don't make from scratch. It's extremely difficult to escape buying foods containing corn, since a variety of pseudonyms are used, including baking powder, caramel color, dextrose, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stearic acid, and vanilla, making it a nightmare for anyone with corn allergies.

Perhaps the most effective element is that of nostalgia. Ian and Curt also take time to find their long-lost relatives in Greene, and to reflect on the rapid changes in our recently agrarian society that have forced farmers to maintain massive farms harvesting non-edible corn. In other words, the farmer can't even feed himself with what he's growing. Without the hefty government subsidies, such large-scale corn operations would be out of business. They interview various farmers and ranchers who are disgusted with the system, but who have little real choice (one farmer says flatly, ""We're growing crap!""). We're shown the evolution of farming equipment and of the family farm itself as a quaint reminder of the past; there are nostalgic shots of Main Street and hometown parades, quiet diners and local bars.

Ian and Curt's visual style is playful; the charts and graphs are hand-drawn, interspersed with stop-motion plastic farm toys to get the point across (and the dancing corn on the map of the US was great, too).  The quirky soundtrack is a standout as well. DVD extras include some outtakes, a music video, bios, and some great 1950s-style educational clips. King Corn is a thought-provoking look at the old adage ""You are what you eat,"" and boy, it's scary.",1213401600,198,4839,5.209511568123394
3077361,5,B0012680D0,"Follow two college students as they learn why corn showed up in their hair analysis. It also addresses the plight of the family farmer, what the farmer goes through to plant and harvest his corn crop, where corn is used in the entire food chain, the use of corn as fuel today, and hopefully, the use of corn silk, stalks, and cobs as future fuel source.
I had seen this DVD on PBS a few weeks before it was available for purchase. I was so impressed with it, I decided to buy a copy.",1211846400,,483,4.148936170212766
3077362,3,B0012680D0,"This documentary helped me understand farm subsidies and how those government policies came to be. I now see how the intentional overproduction of corn has driven down overall food prices in real dollars during the past 30 years. Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems like farm modern industrialization is so efficient that corn farming is not nearly as laborious as I imagined.

Other aspects of the film such as corn fed cattle confinement and the filmmakers' journeys beyond their Iowa project were most intriguing. The ""extras"" are just throw aways, mildly entertaining (dare I say corny?) but nothing near what I've come to expect as bonus material from a good documentary these days.",1210291200,7,695,5.0964912280701755
3077363,3,B0012680D0,"This documentary film is a sort of prequel to Fast Food Nation, and does for film what Michael Pollan has done in his two books, The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food. Best friends Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis relocate from the east coast to Greene, Iowa (population 1,015) to grow an acre of corn and then follow its fortunes after harvest. Planting an acre of 31,000 genetically modified kernels takes eighteen minutes. Fertilizers, sprays, water and time will yield about 200 bushels or 10,000 pounds of corn. That's why there are literal mountains of corn in Iowa. But none of it is edible, and was ever intended to be, until it is artificially processed. Over half of the crop goes to feed cattle, another third goes for ethanol and exports, and then a significant minority of it goes to make high fructose corn syrup and similar sweeteners that you'll find on virtually every label of processed food. In short, this is corn that is not really food. Cheney and Ellis netted a loss of $19.92 on their acre of corn, but that's before massive government subsidies put them in the black. Not even the farmers in this film were happy about agribusiness as usual, but that's the story of corn to date.",1209513600,51,1205,4.635514018691588
3077364,5,B0012680D0,"This film is an amazing look into the amazing complexity of corn production and consumption.  It is encouraging me to seek grass fed beef and other more natural products (without high-fructose corn syrup).

I was disappointed, however, that the writers failed to mention that corn production relies heavily on lots of equipment that use non-renewable fossil fuels.  As fossil fuels get more scarce, prices will (hopefully gradually) rise.  What will we do then?  Offer more subsidies to farmers?

Not only does the government subsidize corn production, it also subsidizes conversion of corn into ethanol.  The process of converting corn into ethanol uses more energy than is derived from the ethanol.  We use fossil fuels to heat and move the processes involved.  Nobody would be making ethanol from corn if it wasn't subsidized.",1209081600,7,829,5.21969696969697

There are many other subjects touched upon, including the far reaching impacts of conventional agriculture, the disappearance of family farms, the economic impact of corn on small town America.  This film would be a great starting point for people just learning about the current state of the food system, or the film the well versed person might lend to their less than knowledgeable friends.

3077488,5,B0012680D0,"We are what we eat...and as this movie points out we are all full of contaminated toxic corn! It would be one thing if corn was of high food value....but its not.  As the movie points out so clearly.....trying to locate anything in the grocery store that does not contain corn is nearly impossible!!  Corn is in nearly everything!!

I stopped eating corn about 6 months ago and I have never felt better.  Many of my health issues went away.  This movie just illustrates again to me why I do not eat corn...its toxic!!

The movie is engaging, it a simple plan of the young men to just plant some corn and see where it goes when its harvested and all along the way they are unpleasantly surprised at the process, what corn is doing to our livestock, and what ultimately it is doing to all of us...making us sick and ultimately contributing to our obesity, allergies, respiratory problems, bowel problems and even death.  It is not a coincidence that as agriculture increased, so has the use of pesticides, the yields are increasing....and our health is tanking.

I liked how the film includes all the stages of buying, planting, growing, harvesting, selling....but in between the men talk with experts especially professors who really give the audience and them the hardcore truth......corn is killing the animals and us....and its all in the name of the almighty dollar!

Even though the concept is one I understood prior to watching the film because of my own medical condition....I was still able to learn new things from the movie, one that really stuck out for me was the fact that the mixture we feed our cattle is not only bulking them up to be sold at a higher rate....but we have to butcher them at an exact time because they are actually close to death due to the corn mixture that we are feeding them.  They had a live cow they were taking samples from in the digestive process....and you can actually ""see"" the results of our overfeeding them corn from the problems in their digestive tract.  Really eye opening!

The movie was entertaining, informative, enlightening, yet discouraging, upsetting, frustrating, and ultimately makes me sad that our government is allowing and corporations are continuing when they know fully what it is doing to our livestock and people...and all for MONEY!!

The movie pointed out the irony that farmers today cannot even feed themselves with the crops they are growing.  Sad state of affairs we live in today where we have poisoned our own food and are slowly causing ourselves health problems that can lead to our death.",1414886400,,2565,4.760722347629796

3077491,4,B0012680D0,"I wish they would have said more about the farmers at the end. Where did their mentor move after the auction? The local characters were so interesting. I found it really interesting when the feedlot owner said ""if people wanted grass fed beef that what we would give them"" so often its made out to be that we are ""forced"" into purchasing lower quality food. When perhaps we are making the demand.

I enjoyed the movie and am going to show it to my kids.",1413158400,,453,4.329411764705882

What are we doing to our bodies and food supply?  What are we doing to mankind?  For what purpose does this product exist?

3077514,5,B0012680D0,"This is a delightful and entertaining film - almost Sat AM cartoon that is LIGHT and FLUFFY.  But wait - there's more.  When you step back, KING CORN has deftly presented the impact of Big Food and the Dept of Agriculture on our food.

KING CORN suggests that we may be looking at the first generation in the US where Life Expectancy is LESS than their parents... because of the pervasiveness of CORN in every aisle of the grocery store.

Definitely a movie to watch multiple times.

If this film is the Dessert, the rest of the meal is: Michael Pollan's books, Morton Spurlock's Super-Size Me (book & movie), and Michael Moss' Salt Sugar Fat.

The investigating leads to many aspects of the corn industry which enables the viewer to then do more research on an area that grabs them.

3077530,3,B0012680D0,I enjoyed the documentary about corn.  It was very informative and learned things that I did not know before.  I was disappointed in the fact nothing was mentioned about the amount of corn that GMO and about Monsanto's affect on the corn industry.  Maybe that was not their purpose in making the documentary but so much more could and should have been told.

To see how many people are suffering because of it, and yet are still being sold AND buying these products.  The documentary was very informative about the subject and can open up a lot of ideas to research deeper into the subject.

3077566,3,B0012680D0,"The film and comments alike all share the same issue: Irony.

As a conservative, I feel that I should oppose ANY government subsidies.  However, if it weren't for farm subsidies, there would be NO small farms, only large, corporate farms.  Small farms require a higher profit per acre than a larger farm to sustain the farm owner/operator.  Also, larger farms can exaggerate the issues of monoculture farming as well as increased runoff and other issues with farming ""fence-to-fence"".  If the large corporate farms are part of the problem, then would more subsidies also be part of the solution?

Another solution: Higher corn prices...
We all complain about food costs as it is.  If corn prices went up, food prices would go up.  Ethanol prices would go up.

Even if you live ""off the grid"" and raise your own food, produce/collect your own energy, and dispose of your own waste, you're still living in a country that is sustained and inhabited by ""on-the-grid"" people who just want cheap food, cheap gas, and don't want to think about the real issues.  And if it weren't for those people, there would be no country, and you wouldn't be able to live like you do.

People can make as many movies as they want, write as many books as they want, go out and hold up as many signs as they wan, but the majority of people have spoken: money talks and, well, you know the rest.  Raising corn in the way it is currently done, is only done that way because of economic demand: Consumers demand lower prices.  The farmers are correct, they're not farming to make high quality corn or food, they're running a business, just like any other business owner.

We, the consumers are the problem here, not the farmer/food processor/seed manufacturer.  It would take a large majority of the people in the US, and in the world, to stop the juggernaut of consumerism.

Oh, by the way, if anyone's freaked out about the chemicals that are used to process food, don't be so surprised, it's been done that way from the beginning of time, the chemicals were just disguised as other, non-offending, ""ingredients"", now, they're just ""refined"" and relabeled.

The film is not entirely inaccurate, nor is it entirely unbiased.  Be objective when watching this movie (as with all ""documentaries"").  Remember, you have your own brain in your head, don't just listen to what the movie, the comments, and the media have to say, use your brain and make your own conclusions.

They interview random people in parking lots who make authoritative but unsupported shocking claims about the effects of corn.
Most of what they cover is touched on in other films more extensively, and this isn't the best made or most informative work on the subject.

What I don't understand is why the film is based around buying an acre of farmland in iowa only to produce another plot of corn.

I did however enjoy the interviews. It saved the documentary from failure. I'm also going to mention that I was pretty bothered watching them dine in on fast food and other processed products, especially after noting how terrible corn-based products are. Little confused.

Side note: It's very sad to see the non-commercial farms go. I hope there's a way to solve this problem and earn them back. I would hate to see our future become untouched with nature and unaware of how our food should naturally be grown.

To Ian and Curt,
If you plan a sequel, can you please expand on the topic of why we have chosen to grow more corn in the country over growing raw, natural and whole foods (money??laziness???either way??)? It also can't hurt to get into the details of what exactly corn-based products do for the human body (i.e. what grain fed cows do for the human body versus grass-fed).

One of the detrimental by-products of 'cheap corn' is HFCS (high fructose corn syrup, now in most of our processed foods) which has largely helped shape the obesity epidemic and declining health that seems to be getting only worse here in the U.S., and world-wide in most industrialized nations.

Farm animals are mostly fed inexpensive corn based by-product meal, which fattens them up and makes them get to market faster, but increases the fat content of beef.  In addition, antibiotics are pumped into these animals in order to keep them alive and healthy until slaughter, because this diet is unhealthy to the animal, and they are prone to more illnesses as well.

3077636,5,B0012680D0,"In this interesting and informative documentary two young men, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, return from the east coast to the Iowa farm country of their ancestors in order to find out what it is like to be a corn farmer in America. Their plan is to plant an acre of corn and follow that corn to market and see what happens. They want to know what life is like for the farmers and they want to know how the corn is processed and eventually consumed. What they find out is mixed.

They learn about the high yields that are possible today with the variety of corn that dominates corn production in this country. This plant has the property of being able to grow close to others of its kind, thereby increasing the number of plants per acre. This is good no doubt. However this variety of corn while ideal for the making of high fructose corn syrup and ethanol is lower in other nutrients such as protein and oil. For my perspective this too is okay. If that is what sells, the farmer really doesn't have much choice.

But what is disturbing about the corn farming and processing business are the subsidies that go to big agriculture and the consolidation that has taken place turning small farms into huge farms. Monoculture is a disease of the land. If more small farmers were able to make a living planting different varieties of crops people would eat better and healthier.

Cheney and Ellis also learn that much of the corn is used to fatten cattle. The natural diet of cattle is grass. Fattening them with nothing but corn makes them sick, but not sick enough to die before being slaughtered for the market.

They also learn (if they hadn't already known it) that corn is in an amazing number of the processed foods in the supermarkets and is the basis of McDonald happy meals. In other words king corn is instrumental in fostering and abetting the obesity epidemic.

The documentary is fascinating because it shows the exact details of how planting, weeding (chemically), fertilizing, harvesting and marketing of the corn is done. There are conversations with farmers and others and the famous food writer Michael Pollan makes an appearance.

This is not a documentary that is going to please the corn industry, but it is not a polemic either. I thought it was fair and accurate as far as I know. I am on the side of more diversified farming organically, but I know that feeding the seven plus billion people on this planet isn't possible without mass agricultural methods such as seen in this video. The fact that our government insists on subsidizing a relatively unhealthy diet based on genetically modified corn and soy is the main culprit. If there were subsidies for farmers to plant a wider variety of crops using organic methods that would improve our diet and allow for sustainable agriculture. The problem with this is we would need a larger percent of the population to farm.

The movie was engaging without being grotesque. Where most documentaries of this nature rely on shock value, especially in the sensitive subject of industrial livestock production, these two guys made their appeal with delicate imagery and used dialogue with local farmers that kept the movie light and interesting.

3077652,3,B0012680D0,"I wouldn't say this was a horrible movie, but it certainly wasn't a good one. I think a lot of people think that if the movie's informative or says something you agree with, that makes it a good documentary. I didn't have a problem with the subject matter, it's the way it was presented.

The filmmakers made the choice of inserting themselves into the film. This can be a very effective documentary style (see Michael Moore & Morgan Spurlock for example) but in this case, no offense guys, you just don't have the personality to pull that off. You're not funny, you're not witty, you're not interesting, you're just two dudes floating through this film as if bystanders - which is fine, but then be bystanders, don't be in front of the camera. Don't take offense to that - a lot of people would not be suitable for this type of documentary, including me.

One example: there was a shot in the taxicab where the camera lingers on one of the guys (I don't know their names - and it doesn't matter) presumably to capture his emotional response to some horrible story the driver just told him, yet he's just staring blankly. What emotion was that supposed to be conveying? Either have a reaction worthy of showing us or leave that on the cutting room floor.

Second problem: The filmmakers try to make it look like they're just two schmoes who are clueless about this stuff and are just trying to figure out how corn got into the molecules of their hair. Right. That's insulting our intelligence and just got more & more annoying as the movie went on. You obviously were educated about this topic and that's why you did the movie in the first place.

Third problem: I thought the point of growing an acre of corn was to see what happened to it. But since it's impossible to follow what happened to their one acre of corn because it gets mixed in with everyone else's, that makes that whole part of the movie pointless. At that point they're just doing a more traditional kind of documentary and it was even less important to have them in the story. Yes they still got to show some information about how corn is planted & raised, but they could have shown that, and to better effect, by hanging out with farmers handling real crops.

Fourth problem: I don't remember all the details, but they calculated (spoiler alert?) that if not for the government's checks they would have lost money. Perhaps this is a valid point but using their calculations and drawing conclusions from that is complete B.S. If you were a real farmer, you'd probably own your own equipment, or if not you wouldn't be renting equipment in order to farm one acre of land for 18 minutes. Of course that's not economical!! Fifth problem: Munching into an ear of corn wasn't tasty... well duh, it wasn't sweet corn. There are different varieties of corn. Biting into raw popcorn wouldn't taste good either. That doesn't demonstrate anything one way or the other.

Finally (I could probably go on but I'll just make one more point): What was that ending all about? It was silly and contrived.

Note that nowhere in this comment did I say anything about disagreeing with their message. A good movie could have been made on this subject, but this wasn't it.",1368230400,,3219,4.587826086956522

3077695,5,B0012680D0,"AbsoLUTEly GREAT movie!  Now I see why my nutritionist tells me not to eat corn!

I grew up on a multi-purpose farm in the 1950s and 60s.  Dad grew all the food for our cattle and other crops to sell:  lots of hay, corn, wheat, and soybeans.  I remember the cattle grazing a lot also.  We had 200 head of cattle in the feedlot - MINUSCULE by today's standards.  I recently have come ""back home"" to northeastern Ohio, to my hometown, and noticed the corn in the fields looks really weird!  The leaves are all pointy and stiff looking - doesn't look at ALL like what Dad grew.

So I asked a farmer friend, ""Is the corn different now, or is it just my imagination?""  ""Nope,"" he said, ""it IS different.  The 'pointy' leaves are designed to catch and hold more water; the seeds have been modified to create more yield per acre.""

Well, now I see why.  Almost ALL the family farms from my childhood are gone; the few that remain have been forced to become ""big business"" operations just like in the movie.  One thing the guys in the movie didn't include in their costs (although maybe it was reflected in the rent they paid) was the incredibly high taxes farmers must pay and the cost of their labor.  One can easily see how ""small"" farming is a losing proposition.

God bless our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents who worked SO hard to give us safer food; many ""thanks"" to the US Government for its (as usual) adverse interventions; and BIG thanks to Ian and Curtis for answering my question of ""What happened to the corn?""",1344470400,2,1530,4.469314079422382

3077697,4,B0012680D0,"Corn is ubiquitous in everything we eat.  It's even the number one nutrient found in our hair.  This documentary sheds new light on our obesity epidemic and how we got so big.
Corn, it's fed to cattle and poultry to fatten it up, and us along with it.

Blame Earl Butz, Nixon's secretary of agriculture.  This elderly gentleman in the movie remembers when he was a kid.  The government paid farmer's not to produce as much corn.
People were less obese back then because food cost more, and now it's much cheaper,  and here we are with two out of three adults overweight.

An acre of corn costs $350 to grow and brings in around $325 on the open market.
Farmers make money off corn from government subsidies which allow them to make around $27 an acre.  So because of this, farms keep getting bigger and bigger, with each corn grower farming thousands of acres.  It only takes 18 minutes to plant 31,000 corn kernals using machinery.  Everything is automated.  Specially hybridized corn can produce a staggering two hundred bushels per acre, as opposed to only forty bushels per acre in the nineteen fifties.

Documentarian Aaron Woolfe may be onto something here.  This is a real eye opener.
There is some great photography of the midwest cornbelt here, and the mountains of corn being spewed out of huge machines onto piles on the ground.

I took off one star because after watching so much corn from every possible aspect, it started to get a bit boring.  I never wanted to see or think about corn again, at least for a while, after watching this. However as a documentary it earns five stars for great photography, and thouroughness in covering the subject.

This really gives me a lot to think about, diet wise.  It seems most of the corn produced isn't even fit to eat, not even by the farmers who grow it.  It tastes awful. But it's used to make food ""products"", corn syrup for instance, and make farmers more money when they sell it to big commercial food industries.

As both my parents were farmers and I was raised to respect the land, I was sickened to see what the heartland of this country has become, but I cannot deny the truth of this film.
But the real value of this film is what it says about the morality of our society and what we are doing to our youth. We are disregarding our future so that the industrial farm owners can make more money. We are destroying the entire culture of farming. We are placing a dietary poison into our own bodies for the sake of money. We are raising animals in the most inhumane of ways. We are turning our back on the health of our own citizens.
The film presents the material in an honest, clear way. It is not sensationalized, for it lets the material do the talking.

Milo one of it's relatives can yield just as high,  and yield even more when drought conditions occur.  Milo also used less water and nutrients and less seed is needed.

3077706,4,B0012680D0,"I did not set out to watch a documentary on the state of American food, i was bored one morning, and thanks to the free streaming of Amazon Prime i stumbled upon it.

If you are expecting a fast paced, information based documentary in the style of Michael Moore, then this is not the one.  You have two guys that try to follow the corn chain from growth to consumption by renting an acre of land and doing it themselves.  There is a lot of sentimentality regarding the loss of family farms through the generations, but little sympathy can be evoked.

The amount of products that has corn in its process at some point is staggering.  I find myself reading the labels in my larder now and being shocked at the amount of times i read ""corn"" popping up everywhere.

Fascinating documentary and if you find yourself with 90minutes to kill, then you could do a lot worse",1328400000,,864,4.436708860759493
3077707,3,B0012680D0,"Basic presentation is the purchase of an acre of land in Greene, Iowa for the production of corn and to watch were the corn goes.

We see how corn has been genetic lay altered for better or worse. There are two sides to genetic and we only see one. Our presenters spit their Cornell thing you taste like chalk. But I can go down to the local store and pioneer of corn peel back the leaves, removed some of the silk, and munch away. In fact I use it many times just as a meal.

We learn how to make corn syrup in the kitchen sink. We find this corn syrup in the soda we drink. However the argument that they bring up against corn syrup can easily be turned in to an argument against sugar. Speaking of sugar with a little bit of research you can find versions of Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper made with real sugar. And it will easily pass the blind taste test. Coca-Cola knowing that people could tell the difference pulled the real thing off the market replacing it with New Coke and when all the sugar drinks for off the market replace them with corn syrup with the misnomer of Classic Coke. If you switch to Izze esque you just get 50 calories of fruit juice.

There is a small reference to ethanol which is being used as an excuse to raise the price of corn in food. We all know that we can get cheaper sugar from other countries and make cheaper ethanol and lower the price of corn to make cheaper foods.

There are some vulgar scenes of reaching into cow stomachs that you may want to fast forward through. However in the process they make you understand that too much corn is not that good for cows and cows full of corn are not good for people. And again they forget to tell you with a little research you can find grass fed meat. You might also find Buffalo more to your liking then cows.

This film does not tell us anything we do not already know.  But it can be overwhelming to see it all in one film. The presentation written by Aaron Woolf, Ian Cheney, Curt Ellis and Jeffery K. Miller, seems to lose focus now and then; it is part documentary, part mockumentary and par ""who do you think you are?""  This film is still worth watching but every once in a while you wonder if they know for whom they are making it.

What I find fascinating about this presentation is that years ago we used to say we were eating oil as that is what the fertilizer is made of that we use to make corn and lose some of the energy on the way.

I always wonder if films like this ever change things or if they are ever viewed by the people that created this monstrosity? It is like watching the bad guy and not realizing they are talking about you.

3077716,1,B0012680D0,"I watched this snorefest at the behest of a friend who couldn't stop talking about how great it was. The short review is, ""See `Food, Inc.' instead. Or read books by noted authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser, which are packed with useful and, in many cases, lifestyle-changing bits of info.""

But because ""King Corn"" is being billed as a ""documentary"", let's take a good ol' fashioned gander at what exactly is being documented here.

The story opens in the offices of a man who is never named or otherwise identified (physicist? college professor? grad student with 24-7 lab access?), who performs a RIVETING, off-camera isotopic hair analysis on documentarians/stars Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis. The analysis produces some likewise earth-shattering results: Cheney and Ellis find that approximately 60% of their hair contains the isotopic signature of (drumroll) corn.

Astonishing! Or, it would be, if corn derivatives were not already found in numerous shampoos (though on most product labels it appears as ""hydrolyzed vegetable proteins"") as well as in cosmetics and other things we rub into our hair and/or our bodies. But no one ever tells you that their shampoo or foundation gave them diabetes, or made them fat.

Cheney and Ellis's riveting search for answers to this isotopic dilemma takes them to their natal country, the land of their birthright, reposing amidst the emerald splendours of Iowa's scenic ""corn belt"", which comprises the entire state.

Verily, I sing to thee of Greene, Iowa.

Jewel of Butler County, Greene is set in the midst of such dazzling cosmopolitan centers as New Hartford and Parkersburg. Cheney and Ellis contact a local farmer in advance of their arrival in riveting, stunning Iowa, and ask his express permission to use one acre of his land in order to grow corn. That single acre forms the catalyst which springboards our dynamic duo into a new world of exciting knowledge and brilliantly provocative socio-economic and nutritional insights, as they proceed to:

1.) Tour the vicinity of Greene, taking in breathtaking vistas of corn-related scenery

2.) Talk to a state licensed agricultural advisor at a seed wholesaler's shop about what kind of dirt their acre of land contains, and how they ought to plant corn in it

3.) Drive a big tractor over their acre to create furrows to plant corn in

4.) Plant corn in their acre

5.) Fertilize their corn kernels

6.) Wait for their corn to grow

7.) Talk to some local farmers who also grow corn and/or raise cattle about some of the issues currently plaguing the commercial farming industry (whence arrives the shocking Verdict: the procedures which the corporate ""Big Farming"" consortiums use to produce tremendous amounts of corn are harmful to the average corn consumer, to the environment, and to the cornfed cattle being consumed by the average corn consumer... info we've been aware of for the past couple of decades, at least)

8.) Find an absolutely riveting hemp plant growing in the midst of their corn (there is an entire scene devoted to this)

9.) Wait some more for their corn to grow

10.) Talk to random, unidentified persons in fast food restaurant parking lots who seem to possess a lot of ""big picture"" knowledge concerning the corn- and cattle-farming industries

11.) Wait some more for their corn to grow

12.) Use a montage of ""cold call"" footage to document their efforts to bring a camera crew to a factory that makes corn syrup, which are mercilessly thwarted by the point blank refusals of corporate PR depts. This is something which this documentary attempts to cast in a suspicion-rousing, chin-pulling, ""Hmm, what is this industry hiding from us"" light - when the fact is, almost any factory would flatly refuse to allow total strangers calling on the phone to just show up with a camera crew at the factory doors and tour the plant, because it so happens that this is a great way for competing companies to observe and film certain time-saving and/or money-saving copyrighted manufacturing processes which would then give them an edge in the market.

13.) Get bored waiting for their corn to grow tall, and start playing impromptu baseball games in order to pass the time.

14.) Build a baseball diamond in the middle of their cornfield (No, wait, that was `Field of Dreams')

15.) Direct sidelong glances of counterfeit ""say what?"" toward one another during interviews in which an expert informs them that the strain of corn being grown in Iowa has no nutritional value whatsoever

16.) Watch their corn grow tall

17.) Use riveting stop-motion animations of corn kernels that spread across a map in brushfire fashion, or else march in front of the camera in neat, little lines, to illustrate their brilliant points

18.) Harvest their corn

19.) Masticate some of their corn and quickly come to the realization that it is inedible, unless it is heavily processed first

20.) Interview a New York cabbie who propounds the theory that consuming too much soda made him and his immediate family diabetic and obese

21.) Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....

So, to sum up, a few snippets of an interview with author Michael Pollan (In Defense of Food) do not make this worth an hour and thirty minutes of your time.

3077719,5,B0012680D0,"This was a really nice film to watch. The creators seemed to be natural at documentary film making. There were lots of nice heartwarming and personal interviews and lots of really nice imagery, especially for people who like stop motion and time lapse motion photography. The journey of this story was very interesting as well as very nostalgic. It offered a really nice glimpse into a part of the American heritages of old to new. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I think the creators should take on another subject to document as they made a great duo of filming, interviewing collaborators offering a personal hand story. I don't know the history of the success of this film but I would venture to say that it is probably an award winning film. I would recommend this film.",1306972800,,775,4.705882352941177
3077720,2,B0012680D0,"I thought this movie had potential to be a lot more interesting, informative and entertaining.  Unfortunately the creators included far too much filler and down time footage; it slowed down the pace immensely and made it difficult to sit through.  It's not until halfway through the film do we start learning more interesting factoids about HFCS and its impact on farming.

It seemed like they were trying to make two separate documentaries at once.  One story focused on them; exploring their roots, returning to their grandparent's home town, learning about their family history and how farming has changed over the years.  The other story focused on corn; where it comes from, where it goes and how it finds its way into almost everything we consume.

Because of these two competing story lines I felt that the documentary became watered down.  The movie dragged quite a bit and I think that time could have been better served to provide more information and ask deeper questions.  The movie only managed to pique my interest on the issue rather than provide me with good explanations or answers.",1306022400,,1099,4.934782608695652

3077722,4,B0012680D0,"I would be much more interested in documentaries if more were formatted in similar ways to King Corn.  I appreciated knowing the background stories of the college guys and the way that they came about project.  It is much easier for me to watch a documentary understanding that the producers are simply discovering and sharing information as opposed to indoctrinating their viewers based on a personal bias.  I was also impressed by the credibility of the information that came from this film. From my personal experience, because fewer members of our society are growing up around agriculture, there is a large and growing disconnect between the metropolitan consumer and the country farmer.  I personally view the gap as big enough as to represent 2 completely different cultures in their own right.  I also believe that as of late, much of the information on modern farming has come from 'urbanites' who in some cases may have the right information, but they frequently tear it out of its proper context.  Coming from a farming background, I was initially nervous that this movie would ignorantly bash farmers and the agricultural community, but I found it incredibly refreshing to watch the facts being displayed honoring farmers way of life and small-town culture, while showing their honest disdain in being part of a system that for decades has rewarded the wrong metrics. It was the first documentary in which I could feel that a producer not initially familiar with agricultural community, came away from the experience ""getting us.""

As an advocate of the free-market, I found myself repeatedly agreeing with the conclusions of the producers, that the reason of our overproduction of corn is due to government subsidies.  Corn isn't the enemy per say, its simply that its recent overproduction is due to the fact that farmers are being paid over and above its true market value by the government to produce the crop. Without subsidies, corn demand would decrease as the price of corn rose, and the market would provide be able to provide real alternatives that were economically sustainable for farmers to grow, manufacturers to produce, and consumers to consume.

3077728,5,B0012680D0,"I have an interest in these sorts of independent documentaries, but I always approach with caution. A lot of liberals and others with questionable motives use documentaries to express themselves, which of course is fine. I am not interested in having the producer of a documentary trying to manipulate the way I think, which is why I like factual documentaries. With this film, I suspected I might not like it, even 30 minutes into it I was not sure if I would finish it, but I did. I am glad I did, it was very informative and I really enjoyed it. It is a shame to see what is happening to our food.

In a real sense, the film is conservative (but not necessarily in a political way, perhaps ""philosophically traditional"" is better) in essence. It drives home the point that government is the problem. Due to government subsidies and such, the markets are not balanced in a natural way. The government should really stop this nonsense before the damage is irreparable or extremely painful. If most of our food is made from corn, were the price of corn to shoot up (i.e. if subsidies stopped) then so would the price of food. Presenting us with be a very bad situation. This of course goes without mentioning the danger to health from having a largely corn based diet.

Is the food industry in cohoots with big pharma so that we have all the drugs we need to treat ourselves after a lifetime of eating ""crap""? It's really not that difficult to understand that creating really cheap food market prices by using corn in practically everything is an easy out for our country's farmers. But therein does NOT lie the problem.
Another farmer in this movie was specific in that if American people want grass fed beef, that's what farmers would produce, but since Americans either do want only cheap food or have no idea what they want, the market will continue to inundate our diets with what this movie is titled, King Corn.
Just like gasoline, it seems that a disaster of epic proportions is going to have to bring down an industry that does nothing to stop itself from producing the ""crap"" that the farmer stated in my title box. While barely any alternatives for gasoline and its resulting carbon emissions exist today, we're a bit more lucky with food because of the organic movement in the US. But it's not enough as more people are out of work and can't afford the prices organic food demands, or is THAT a misconception as well??
In any case, buy this movie, see it, share it, the message is clear......stopping ourselves from consuming as much corn as we do wouldn't hurt any farmers, it would demand a change in what they produce.

Its sold along side FOOD INC., and FOOD MATTERS ... which I bought and found both HIGHLY informative and interesting.  This film was neither.  To sell this production along side both of the former titles would imply that they are related.  If it were not for the mere fact that the main focus of the film was a food item then these three titles would have NO common link at all.  I was expecting to find another harsh expose' on the corn industry and plant exposing all its evils wrought unto mankind.  NOPE ... What I got was a sappy story of two nerdy twenty somethings rediscovering their roots ... if it were to stand alone, its still not even a decent documentary.  The segments are disjointed and you have no sense of linear story telling or continuity.  They jump around so much that I honestly fell asleep 20 mins into the movie... slept for 40 and woke up and felt as thought I missed NOTHING.  Two things stand out that I can praise about the film.  The Section about Secretary Buts and the boys actually visit the retired man living in an assisted living facility well into his 80's/90's by this point.  His interview showcases a man that still believes he did the right thing at the time and although the outcome may not have been what he had foreseen (GLUTTONY and SLOTH) He still stands proud as a man that affected change in this country, right or wrong, to provide the lowest costing food ever.  Also the story of Farmer Payatt who humored the two spoiled brats by allowing them to plant an acre of corn on his farm .  My heart truly bled for him at the end of the film when I realized that his was the farm up for auction, even though  they were deep into the scene before that was even apparent.  Again, as through the rest of their work, I suppose the filmmakers just wanted the audience to guess what the hell was going on during the climax of their presentation ...

I've burned down all my wooden buildings, except for the 'century house'.  I'm 75.  When I'm gone someone else can raze that.

The impoverishment and de-humanizing of Iowa is deliberate government policy, the opposite of some European countries.  Our present system does work well for huge agricultural supply and commodity conglomerates.

High tarrifs on imported cane sugar exacerbate the problem. The goal is to keep Americans eating inferior corn sugar products at protected prices.

It takes a lifetime of on-farm experience to successfully operate a viable 'sustainable agriculture' farm.  Such expertise is dying or dead.  Iowans raise 'export kids' to find careers in other states.

I was amazed that we have a surplus of corn yet American crops are still being forced to produce more corn....and a type of corn that isn't EVEN eatable is retarded. The corn has to be processed at a plant owned by corrupt business owners who dictate once again what will be done with all this corn and how to incorporate it into our daily diet and into almost every possible food you purchase on a regular grocery store shelf. Amazing enough corn has no dietary benefits to our diet and makes obesity skyrocket in America; and other nations who drink soda...which is almost pure high fructose corn syrup. This is bad politics, bad for our environment, bad for our bodies, simply bad economics and use of our American soil.

It is an entertaining though disturbing documentary that is more accurately categorized with other food INDUSTRY documentaries, such as Food, Inc. or The World According to Monsanto (both alarming and eye-opening as well).
Supersize Me is wonderful for following, in one man, the appalling health deterioration born of eating only corn (okay, of eating only McDonald's, but watch King Corn, and you'll see the direct parallel), but Supersize Me doesn't cover how the US government indirectly yet absolutely funds the fast food industry and almost every packaged, processed, unhealthy food on the market by subsidizing the commodity crops that are those foods' core ingredients.

Watch King Corn.  Then watch Supersize Me again (or for the first time--it's REALLY entertaining).  And this time you'll understand WHY it costs McDonald's only five cents for every twenty five cent Supersize they're able to sell.  It's because corn is subsidized; it's cheap.  And corn is in EVERYTHING they serve.

And by the way, the irony of this in the midst of our current healthcare battle is tremendous.  Government pays for the creation of cheap, abundant, crappy food that makes our bodies obese, diabetic, and sick, then Congress fights about how to fund the ever-growing healthcare burden of obese, diabetic, sick patients.  Regardless of HOW we fund it, we're fighting about the pound of cure.  I don't argue that government should strip farm subsidies.  But if we're really going to argue about the cost of healthcare, we should be fighting about how to better use farm subsidy funds to grow healthy food.

3077761,4,B0012680D0,"For those who were shocked and amazed by the workings of the food industry in the documentary Food, Inc. There is another little known film that came out in 2006 that serves as a sort of compendium project. King Corn documents a year in the life of two Bostonians who lease an acre of land in Iowa to grow a crop of corn.

Ironically, the college chums, a couple of likeable fellows with an affinity for whiffle-ball and fast food, both had a great grandfather from the same county in Iowa. So once the two find a landowner to lease them the property and a farmer to help them plant their crop, they start to explore not only their familial roots, but the roots of the corn industry. As the corn grows, so does their search, bringing them to some truly eye-opening realizations about the US food industry.

Though a lot of the information has been touched on in films like Food, Inc. and Super Size Me as well as books like Fast Food Nation and The Omnivore's Dilemma, King Corn delivers it from a different perspective. By telling the story from a would-be farmer's perspective, the filmmakers are just as amazed as we are when they learn firsthand some of the inner workings of the agricultural industry. From the realization that US farmers are paid primarily through government subsidies since they often actually lose money on their crops to the fact that the majority of corn grown in Iowa is so genetically altered that it is not suitable to be eaten, even for those who have heard this information before, the film delivers it in such a compelling way that it seems fresh and consistently alarming.

The filmmakers deliver an evenhanded expose of the corn industry that doesn't seem as scathing as so many documentaries of late have. Nevertheless, by the end, when they actually have to take their harvest to market, you can really feel their heartbreak as they sell their prize crop with no idea where it will be going or what it will be used for. Will it be one of the 20,000 acres of corn it takes just to sweeten the sodas consumed in Brooklyn, NY in one year? Will it be used to quickly fatten up cattle? Or will it be used in one of the thousands of other food products made primarily of corn?

The film points out that we now spend less of our income on food than any generation in history, and fewer of us are needed to produce that food. However, considering that we are sacrificing so much of the nutritional value to keep costs down in a society with an explosion of problems like obesity and obesity, we have to wonder if we shouldn't reconsider our food budget. As one interviewee says of the government agricultural subsidies, ""We subsidize the Happy Meals, but we don't subsidize the healthy ones."" And yet so many of the farmers in the film insisted that if the American people demanded healthy food, they would be glad to grow it, but the current schism of quickly grown, high yield, low nutrition agriculture is going to be hard to break from. Nevertheless, considering that the impetus for the film was the realization that for the first time in history, this generation's life expectancy is lower than the generation before, our diets need to become a higher priority.",1255651200,8,3196,4.5821678321678325

Usually with documentaries there is a complete one-sided view that typically bashes the other side. This one doesn't do that, instead it asks questions and seeks to find the answers. While I knew that corn syrup was in a good chunk of all the foods that are out there, I didn't realize it comes from mass produced corn that is inedible. Everything that they found while on their ""down time"" after planting 31,000 genetically modified seed in 18 minutes they traveled around the country to find out where the corn they grow ends up. This part of the movie was quite interesting but it seemed to point out this is a huge chunk of problem we have with obestity in this country, there are numerous other factors.

health-care (the one point I wish the film had made more directly).
This film should be seen by all Americans. I saw another comment that
quiblbed with the particulars in the film. The film is not a doctoral
thesis, it is a piece of art trying to raise awareness. I also thought
the device of the two filmmakers staking out an acre of corn and
following it through the year as a spine to the story was quite
wonderful, as well as the animations that they did with a still camera.

KING CORN confirms what you've heard about high fructose corn syrup, one major result of the post-1970s corn glut, but includes information you may not have.

Almost as remarkable as KING CORN's take on the worrisome corn-dominated American diet are the film's hosts, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis.  Because they are not journalists, Cheney and Ellis are not making KING CORN as a natural extension of gathering news the way Michael Moore does in documentaries such as ROGER AND ME and SICKO.  Both Boston, Massachusetts, city dwellers, Cheney and Ellis are not even farmers.  The entertaining personalities of these young men make KING CORN even easier to view as we watch them farm their own acre of land.  KING CORN could get away with a simple voice-over narration as it outlines the facts about America's food crisis, but Cheney and Ellis make it that much more interesting without becoming a distraction.  They even prove able skit players in the KING CORN D.V.D. extras.

Mention the name Earl Butz and KING CORN now competes with the late secretary of agriculture's famously ignorant remark about African Americans as the first thought to come to mind.  KING CORN points to Butz's 1970s drive to make American corn abundantly cheap as the start of America's bad diet.  Butz, whom KING CORN interviews prior to his 2008 death, still brags that the American corn-ucopia makes food inexpensive.  Either he does not see or won't admit that corn's profusion  changes it from food to just a raw material, the resulting high fructose corn syrup explosion contributing to record weight gain in America.  What good is low-priced food that leads to diabetes and heart disease?  In the long run, isn't it costing Americans more?

This movie picks up on that subject matter with a in-depth look at corn and the industry.  It is done with some sense of humor about the subect matter, but ultimately it is an eye opener and somewhat scary.

From the ramifications of where corn is used and how how in contributes to health issues ranging from obesity to chaning the feed for livestock, the movie is encompassing in getting the message across and shedding light on the industry in a manner that is not quick as hard handed as some others in this genre, but just as effective.",1249948800,2,803,4.47945205479452
3077767,5,B0012680D0,"I just read ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" and then stumbled upon this DVD at the library.  Michael Pollan is actually in the movie and if you've read the book you will like how the movie dovetails nicely with his writing.  It still manages to be homey and entertaining while teaching you that corn is the basis for our food industry and why this is problematic.  A few things you will learn:

1) Corn is in EVERTHING we eat, from our soda sweetened with high fructose corn syrup to our meat as almost all the animals we eat are corn-fed. Corn fed animals are not natural, cows don't have the digestive tracts to process corn, they are meant to eat grass.  A corn fed diet must be supplemented with antibiotics to keep the cows alive as corn eventually kills them.  According to the movie, 70% of antibiotics in the US are fed to animals grown for human consumption.

2) In the last several decades self-sufficient family farms have gone the way of the dinosaur because the best way for a farmer to eek out a living is to grow Corn on every square inch of land thanks to our unsustainable agricultural policies.

3) Corn has been genetically altered to the point where industrial corn grown on farms really can't be eaten until it has been processed with all sorts of nasty chemicals to break it down into all kinds of weird food products.

King Corn is really sort of gentle expose on what is wrong with our food system.",1248134400,5,1415,4.474708171206226
3077768,4,B0012680D0,"This is exactly what I would want from this film. Cheney and Ellis spoke calmly. They were respectful, civil or polite with everyone they spoke with.  They did not scream an agenda at their audience and they seemed to have successfully sought out open and honest input from all quarters. I respect that.

It's worth noting that in the scenes that made the final cut I only counted one of what struck me as a blatant moment of putting an idea in for those who aren't thinking for themselves (something many well known ""documentaries"" are riddled with).  And lets think about that.  Who is out there seeking out documentaries about where their food comes from that isn't trying to think for themselves.  So it makes perfect sense that tasting dent corn right off the cob long before it is ready for a dried harvest makes for a yuck experience?  I'm sure everyone could figure that out and would figure it out well enough to grow sweet corn if they wanted it to taste good for fresh eating.

Although I already knew a good bit of what was presented, there was still benefit to me from watching it in the way that these two men presented it.  Also, there were some surprising things that I did not know ahead of time and enjoyed learning.

I'm a wife, homeschooling mother, homemaker as well as a foodie, a novice gardener and a home cook with a passion for cooking from scratch and collecting cookbooks.  This documentary really put some drive in me to make more changes to my diet, specifically to start buying grass-fed beef a side at a time. This is something I've wanted to do and thought would be a healthful change for years now, but I haven't acted on it beyond buying a deep freeze and then not filling it with pastured beef and poultry.  But two weeks ago I bought my first pastured poultry from a local man who only has an acre but is getting back to the land in his own way and this coming fall I am going to buy my first side of beef from a local grass-feeding cattle farmer.

Maybe I'll even look into what it would take to sponsor a screening of this film for my food coop and other interested parties.",1247616000,,2113,4.403598971722365

3077774,4,B0012680D0,"Two friends from college decided to track the process of growing America's #1 crop - corn. We see them rent their own acre of land and start, literally from scratch.

They learn some of the evils and the economies of what has become the big business of agriculture - in some ways following in the footsteps of Roger Moore. They produce an eye-opening documentary. However these two pals do their investigating in a hands-on, non-confrontational way. As much as possible, they become a part of the Iowa community where they start their jovially hip adventure.

They usher us through the process of sowing and reaping the corn, as it is done now with giant combines yielding billions of tons of grain every year. Then the friends pursue their crop as it is traded and processed, and as it makes its way to our tables in one form or another.

They show how ubiquitous a part of our lives corn is. It is added as sweetener to almost all the processed food products we eat now, perhaps contributing to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. It is the staple ingredient in most cattle feed. All of this commercial corn is foul-tasting, almost inedible in its primary raw state.

The two young men do a good job of showing the details of the journey the corn makes from seed to feed. They include the way the crop is fertilized using ammonia. They touch on the herbicides sprayed on the fields and how these chemicals do their work of eradicating weeds without harming the young corn shoots. However, there's one glaring omission. The pals don't discuss pesticides at all, and seem not to have used any on their God's Little Acre.

But the two also take the larger view. They probe the different philosophies that have guided Government programs dealing with farmers. They even track down Earl Butz, the controversial Secretary of Agriculture in the Nixon-Ford Administration, and interview him. He explains how he revamped and reversed the system of incentives given to farmers. He saw that they were paid, not for how much land they withheld from production, but for how much land they planted. This policy has contributed to the near-glut of corn on the market and to the creation of vast monoculture farms.

There's a wealth of information in this documentary, presented in a lively, engaging way. The pals in effect take a cheery road trip with each other and with their corn - but make some sobering discoveries along the way.",1233532800,,2425,4.734597156398104

3077777,5,B0012680D0,"Having recently made a friend of a person who is very allergic to corn I was ""sensitized"" into watching this. My friend and this film gave me a whole new appreciation of just how ubiquitous corn is in our diet. It's nearly impossible to avoid corn in so many commercial products it's insane. It also becomes obvious it's certainly not wise to have our nations figurative eggs in so few crop-baskets, virtual mono cultures. I'm old enough to remember grass finished beef, and prefer it, and think it's beyond egregious that animals are subjected to CAFO's and factory slaugher houses that regularly have to recall hundreds of thousands of pounds of meat due to contamination. The waste is totally unacceptable and now Mexico won't accept meat from many of our processors. This traces back to the ubiquitous use of corn and factory farming. Besides the unnatural corn in cattle rations there are other ""proteins"" including processed road kill and euthanized pets. The epidemic rise if type II diabetes in this country must be tied to so much corn and sweetener/browner/filler/starch as before the use of so much corn, diabetes was fairly UNcommon. The corn syrup seems to upset the metabolic system and contributes to obesity. I do wish that movie had addressed the issues surrounding GMO corn. But then, the lawsuits might have started rolling in. Corn that kills the earworm isn't something I want on my menu. I realize that bacterium thuringensis is fairly harmless when used as a dust on corn silks, but who knows what the effect is when it's built into every single kernel we eat of that particular modificication. That said the movie is easy watching with compassion for those who are being forced out of a way of life lived happily for generations and even out of small towns where generations have lived. It is an appeal for America to come to it's senses and have a good look around. We're very soon going to need the jobs small farms provide AND food we can actually eat might be handy!",1231113600,,1994,4.765895953757226
3077778,5,B0012680D0,"King Corn is a very informative, and sightly disturbing documentary about the American food chain. Two friends from the city travel west to the small town of Greene, Iowa to plant one acre of corn. They do this to try and learn, and show others, what corn farming has become. While in that small town, they interview many wonderful farmers and even see some old family photos. By strange coincidence, the friends who did this documentary both had relatives in this very small town. They do all this while they grow their corn, and sell it on the corn market. They document this whole process very well, and turn it into the documentary: King Corn.

  Riddled with many facts, statistics, interviews with corn farmers, and stop motion with corn kernels, King corn informs you of the many problems with American Food. First off, corn is in almost everything we eat, the average American even has corn in their hair. Then it tells of the large amounts of pesticides and chemicals used to grow corn. They can not be good for the health of the corn plant, or the health of the organisms who consume it. It also discuses how terrible a diet of corn is for cattle, and that nearly every cattle farm in America feeds their cattle corn. In addition to all this, the documentary is funny, has a very personal and small-town-America edge to it. All of this, and more, combine to make this an excellent documentary.  It has really made me question th quality of the food I eat. I highly recomend this documentary to any person who has ever questioned the quality of their food, or just wants to be educated about this important subject.

The filmmakers, Curt and Ian, take a seemingly boring subject and inject it with humor and surprising facts. Their behind the scenes view of the insurgence of corn into the diets of so many people is quite surprising and sad at the same time. The honesty that they are able to extract from the very farmers who grow the corn is astounding, as I thought they would defend their product vehemently. However, the farmers seemed to really understand where the filmmakers were taking their story and were willing to share the truth, admitting they were part of the problem.

Facts abound, as is usual for a documentary, but are portrayed using ""cute"" stop motion photography with candy corn and Little People playsets, making them light and fun.

Although the movie did tend to bloat around the middle part, just like the American waistline, it picked right up and ended strong. The final shot of Curt and Ian purchasing the acre of land and deciding to plant grass was very poignant and touching at the same time.

The older townsfolk interviewed don't come off as cynical.  They come off as fatalistically pragmatic.  Both dependent on large subsidies and likely to be run out of business by people better at lining up subsidies and agribusiness contracts, they all know it is the only game in town.

In the end King Corn enables the cheap production of massive amounts of meat and corn syrup.  Even most of the poorest americans can now afford to feed themselves into 280 pound bodies and diabetes.

Control how much is grown (acres), control the prices, and make sure they are ""nicey nicey"" to other countries and buy commodities from them. I want to laugh and say, if you could get a promotion and make more money, would you do it? Why should a farmer not do what makes them money? DUH! If commodities could be sold in a free market economy, it would be great. We don't want subsidies, we want a free market and the government's hand out of our business.

Many farmers in the western high plains are barely making it. They're not rolling in money, they don't have retirement plans, they don't have many of the luxuries you city dwellers (and not self-employed workers) have....you work for someone who pays for your health insurance and offers a 401k? Must be nice! You worry about how much gas cost in your little car? Must be nice.....we spend THOUSANDS in fuel each month.

I am not saying that they don't have some valid points, especially regarding the over processed food we eat. But its pretty ignorant to ""blame corn"" over it. 99.9% of my crop feeds cattle. Cattle ranchers would like to make money too, and feeding corn is more profitable in the long run than grass...besides, I hate to break the news to you, there is not an abundance of grassland in the country.

It traces the pervasive influence of corn on modern America, including the obesity epidemic and the fact that Iowa is growing trillions of bushels of *non-edible* corn to continue receiving lucrative government subsidies. College buddies Ian and Curt, both from the east coast, discover that they both had distant relatives from the same small town of Greene, Iowa. Ian and Curt decide to go to Iowa and plant one acre of corn, following it through its lifecycle, including where it goes after the harvest.

The film starts off slowly as the reasons for the trip are explained. The prerequisite talking heads introduce some scary factoids about how Americans are literally made of corn; if you do a hair analysis, it's like a diet diary, and the vast majority of the American diet (corn-fed beef, fast foods and processed foods) contains corn derivatives. Much of the corn we ingest is in the guise of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a cheaper alternative to sugar that is produced via a scary chemical conversion involving several toxic acids.  HFCS has been directly linked to the current obesity crisis and its impact on Type II Diabetes (the body processes HFCS differently from table sugar). Prior to the 1970s, hardly any company used HFCS due to its high cost. But after then-Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz did away with the old New Deal market control policies in favor of rapid expansion in 1973, there was a constant surplus of cheap (and non-edible) corn, fueling the rapid expansion of the corn syrup industry. Here's a quick test: walk into any convenience store and count how many items contain corn, specifically corn syrup. The list includes obvious choices like soda and candy, but you'll also find HFCS in deli meats, breads, ketchup, pickle relish, spaghetti sauce, and cough syrup.  Oh yes, and one main variety of corn grown in Iowa (Liberty) is genetically modified, as is at least one ingredient in HFCS manufacturing.

Corn production geared towards ethanol is briefly mentioned, but the majority of the focus in King Corn is on the impact of non-edible corn on the nation's food supply. In this respect, it's kind of a gentler version of Supersize Me; there's no shock value for the most part. Also mentioned is the disastrous consequence of converting cattle from grazing animals to force-fed confined ones. Cattle normally forage for a plant-based diet, but it is far more profitable to bring them up to market weight by forcing them to stand still and eat continuously. In addition, the acids present in corn cause deadly ulcers for the cows, who are slaughtered before developing acidosis.  The end result is that 70% of the antibiotics in the US are used on livestock (antibiotics combat both the acidosis and the infections resulting from confinement).  Literally everything at McDonald's contains corn: your hamburger is corn-fed, the bun contains HFCS, your soda contains HFCS, the French fries are fried in corn (or soybean) oil, and your ketchup and pickle contains HFCS. Ditto for most vending machine foods, frozen dinners, and anything you don't make from scratch. It's extremely difficult to escape buying foods containing corn, since a variety of pseudonyms are used, including baking powder, caramel color, dextrose, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stearic acid, and vanilla, making it a nightmare for anyone with corn allergies.

Perhaps the most effective element is that of nostalgia. Ian and Curt also take time to find their long-lost relatives in Greene, and to reflect on the rapid changes in our recently agrarian society that have forced farmers to maintain massive farms harvesting non-edible corn. In other words, the farmer can't even feed himself with what he's growing. Without the hefty government subsidies, such large-scale corn operations would be out of business. They interview various farmers and ranchers who are disgusted with the system, but who have little real choice (one farmer says flatly, ""We're growing crap!""). We're shown the evolution of farming equipment and of the family farm itself as a quaint reminder of the past; there are nostalgic shots of Main Street and hometown parades, quiet diners and local bars.

Ian and Curt's visual style is playful; the charts and graphs are hand-drawn, interspersed with stop-motion plastic farm toys to get the point across (and the dancing corn on the map of the US was great, too).  The quirky soundtrack is a standout as well. DVD extras include some outtakes, a music video, bios, and some great 1950s-style educational clips. King Corn is a thought-provoking look at the old adage ""You are what you eat,"" and boy, it's scary.",1213401600,198,4839,5.209511568123394
3311858,5,B0012680D0,"Follow two college students as they learn why corn showed up in their hair analysis. It also addresses the plight of the family farmer, what the farmer goes through to plant and harvest his corn crop, where corn is used in the entire food chain, the use of corn as fuel today, and hopefully, the use of corn silk, stalks, and cobs as future fuel source.
I had seen this DVD on PBS a few weeks before it was available for purchase. I was so impressed with it, I decided to buy a copy.",1211846400,,483,4.148936170212766
3311859,3,B0012680D0,"This documentary helped me understand farm subsidies and how those government policies came to be. I now see how the intentional overproduction of corn has driven down overall food prices in real dollars during the past 30 years. Perhaps I'm missing something, but it seems like farm modern industrialization is so efficient that corn farming is not nearly as laborious as I imagined.

Other aspects of the film such as corn fed cattle confinement and the filmmakers' journeys beyond their Iowa project were most intriguing. The ""extras"" are just throw aways, mildly entertaining (dare I say corny?) but nothing near what I've come to expect as bonus material from a good documentary these days.",1210291200,7,695,5.0964912280701755
3311860,3,B0012680D0,"This documentary film is a sort of prequel to Fast Food Nation, and does for film what Michael Pollan has done in his two books, The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food. Best friends Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis relocate from the east coast to Greene, Iowa (population 1,015) to grow an acre of corn and then follow its fortunes after harvest. Planting an acre of 31,000 genetically modified kernels takes eighteen minutes. Fertilizers, sprays, water and time will yield about 200 bushels or 10,000 pounds of corn. That's why there are literal mountains of corn in Iowa. But none of it is edible, and was ever intended to be, until it is artificially processed. Over half of the crop goes to feed cattle, another third goes for ethanol and exports, and then a significant minority of it goes to make high fructose corn syrup and similar sweeteners that you'll find on virtually every label of processed food. In short, this is corn that is not really food. Cheney and Ellis netted a loss of $19.92 on their acre of corn, but that's before massive government subsidies put them in the black. Not even the farmers in this film were happy about agribusiness as usual, but that's the story of corn to date.",1209513600,51,1205,4.635514018691588
3311861,5,B0012680D0,"This film is an amazing look into the amazing complexity of corn production and consumption.  It is encouraging me to seek grass fed beef and other more natural products (without high-fructose corn syrup).

I was disappointed, however, that the writers failed to mention that corn production relies heavily on lots of equipment that use non-renewable fossil fuels.  As fossil fuels get more scarce, prices will (hopefully gradually) rise.  What will we do then?  Offer more subsidies to farmers?

Not only does the government subsidize corn production, it also subsidizes conversion of corn into ethanol.  The process of converting corn into ethanol uses more energy than is derived from the ethanol.  We use fossil fuels to heat and move the processes involved.  Nobody would be making ethanol from corn if it wasn't subsidized.",1209081600,7,829,5.21969696969697

There are many other subjects touched upon, including the far reaching impacts of conventional agriculture, the disappearance of family farms, the economic impact of corn on small town America.  This film would be a great starting point for people just learning about the current state of the food system, or the film the well versed person might lend to their less than knowledgeable friends.

I stopped eating corn about 6 months ago and I have never felt better.  Many of my health issues went away.  This movie just illustrates again to me why I do not eat corn...its toxic!!

The movie is engaging, it a simple plan of the young men to just plant some corn and see where it goes when its harvested and all along the way they are unpleasantly surprised at the process, what corn is doing to our livestock, and what ultimately it is doing to all of us...making us sick and ultimately contributing to our obesity, allergies, respiratory problems, bowel problems and even death.  It is not a coincidence that as agriculture increased, so has the use of pesticides, the yields are increasing....and our health is tanking.

I liked how the film includes all the stages of buying, planting, growing, harvesting, selling....but in between the men talk with experts especially professors who really give the audience and them the hardcore truth......corn is killing the animals and us....and its all in the name of the almighty dollar!

Even though the concept is one I understood prior to watching the film because of my own medical condition....I was still able to learn new things from the movie, one that really stuck out for me was the fact that the mixture we feed our cattle is not only bulking them up to be sold at a higher rate....but we have to butcher them at an exact time because they are actually close to death due to the corn mixture that we are feeding them.  They had a live cow they were taking samples from in the digestive process....and you can actually ""see"" the results of our overfeeding them corn from the problems in their digestive tract.  Really eye opening!

The movie was entertaining, informative, enlightening, yet discouraging, upsetting, frustrating, and ultimately makes me sad that our government is allowing and corporations are continuing when they know fully what it is doing to our livestock and people...and all for MONEY!!

The movie pointed out the irony that farmers today cannot even feed themselves with the crops they are growing.  Sad state of affairs we live in today where we have poisoned our own food and are slowly causing ourselves health problems that can lead to our death.",1414886400,,2565,4.760722347629796

KING CORN suggests that we may be looking at the first generation in the US where Life Expectancy is LESS than their parents... because of the pervasiveness of CORN in every aisle of the grocery store.

Definitely a movie to watch multiple times.

3312063,3,B0012680D0,"The film and comments alike all share the same issue: Irony.

As a conservative, I feel that I should oppose ANY government subsidies.  However, if it weren't for farm subsidies, there would be NO small farms, only large, corporate farms.  Small farms require a higher profit per acre than a larger farm to sustain the farm owner/operator.  Also, larger farms can exaggerate the issues of monoculture farming as well as increased runoff and other issues with farming ""fence-to-fence"".  If the large corporate farms are part of the problem, then would more subsidies also be part of the solution?

Another solution: Higher corn prices...
We all complain about food costs as it is.  If corn prices went up, food prices would go up.  Ethanol prices would go up.

Even if you live ""off the grid"" and raise your own food, produce/collect your own energy, and dispose of your own waste, you're still living in a country that is sustained and inhabited by ""on-the-grid"" people who just want cheap food, cheap gas, and don't want to think about the real issues.  And if it weren't for those people, there would be no country, and you wouldn't be able to live like you do.

People can make as many movies as they want, write as many books as they want, go out and hold up as many signs as they wan, but the majority of people have spoken: money talks and, well, you know the rest.  Raising corn in the way it is currently done, is only done that way because of economic demand: Consumers demand lower prices.  The farmers are correct, they're not farming to make high quality corn or food, they're running a business, just like any other business owner.

We, the consumers are the problem here, not the farmer/food processor/seed manufacturer.  It would take a large majority of the people in the US, and in the world, to stop the juggernaut of consumerism.

Oh, by the way, if anyone's freaked out about the chemicals that are used to process food, don't be so surprised, it's been done that way from the beginning of time, the chemicals were just disguised as other, non-offending, ""ingredients"", now, they're just ""refined"" and relabeled.

The film is not entirely inaccurate, nor is it entirely unbiased.  Be objective when watching this movie (as with all ""documentaries"").  Remember, you have your own brain in your head, don't just listen to what the movie, the comments, and the media have to say, use your brain and make your own conclusions.

They interview random people in parking lots who make authoritative but unsupported shocking claims about the effects of corn.
Most of what they cover is touched on in other films more extensively, and this isn't the best made or most informative work on the subject.

3312100,3,B0012680D0,"i see this documentary as a learning experience for ian and curt. i did not have to spend a year for myself farming an acre of corn in iowa in order to understand that corn production is a huge problem in the U.S. The topic can be eye-opening for those who are unaware. What I don't understand is why the film is based around buying an acre of farmland in iowa only to produce another plot of corn.

I did however enjoy the interviews. It saved the documentary from failure. I'm also going to mention that I was pretty bothered watching them dine in on fast food and other processed products, especially after noting how terrible corn-based products are. Little confused.

Side note: It's very sad to see the non-commercial farms go. I hope there's a way to solve this problem and earn them back. I would hate to see our future become untouched with nature and unaware of how our food should naturally be grown.

To Ian and Curt,
If you plan a sequel, can you please expand on the topic of why we have chosen to grow more corn in the country over growing raw, natural and whole foods (money??laziness???either way??)? It also can't hurt to get into the details of what exactly corn-based products do for the human body (i.e. what grain fed cows do for the human body versus grass-fed). That should help the audience have a better understanding of why our generation has a shorter life expectancy than the generation before. Adding some proven science in there can't hurt as well.",1387497600,,1479,4.552631578947368

In ""King Corn,"" for me, the biggest reveals are (1) the connection between corn feed and antibiotics in livestock raised for meat; and (2) the impact on livestock corn diets and fat content in beef.  Oh, and (3) the pervasive use of high fructose corn syrup in just about everything.  Now I find myself reading the labels for everything.  It's like we can't escape this stuff.

3312116,5,B0012680D0,"This excellent documentary is about how government corn subsidies (and consequently, farming practices that arose from these), have affected every link of the food chain, including us humans and our increasing obesity and declining health.  One of the detrimental by-products of 'cheap corn' is HFCS (high fructose corn syrup, now in most of our processed foods) which has largely helped shape the obesity epidemic and declining health that seems to be getting only worse here in the U.S., and world-wide in most industrialized nations. In addition, the film delves into how our meat has changed as well, and not for the better.  Farm animals are mostly fed inexpensive corn based by-product meal, which fattens them up and makes them get to market faster, but increases the fat content of beef.  In addition, antibiotics are pumped into these animals in order to keep them alive and healthy until slaughter, because this diet is unhealthy to the animal, and they are prone to more illnesses as well.  The facts unfold as 2 young men friends move from Boston to Iowa to trace their family's roots and to expose how the current agricultural system creates abundance on the one hand, but makes many sick by imbibing HFCS (and GMO corn) on the other hand!

It also touches briefly on GMO in relation to corn in particular.

Its worth the watch and for me, spawned a new look at the foods I eat and where they come from.

3312133,5,B0012680D0,"In this interesting and informative documentary two young men, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, return from the east coast to the Iowa farm country of their ancestors in order to find out what it is like to be a corn farmer in America. Their plan is to plant an acre of corn and follow that corn to market and see what happens. They want to know what life is like for the farmers and they want to know how the corn is processed and eventually consumed. What they find out is mixed.

They learn about the high yields that are possible today with the variety of corn that dominates corn production in this country. This plant has the property of being able to grow close to others of its kind, thereby increasing the number of plants per acre. This is good no doubt. However this variety of corn while ideal for the making of high fructose corn syrup and ethanol is lower in other nutrients such as protein and oil. For my perspective this too is okay. If that is what sells, the farmer really doesn't have much choice.

But what is disturbing about the corn farming and processing business are the subsidies that go to big agriculture and the consolidation that has taken place turning small farms into huge farms. Monoculture is a disease of the land. If more small farmers were able to make a living planting different varieties of crops people would eat better and healthier.

Cheney and Ellis also learn that much of the corn is used to fatten cattle. The natural diet of cattle is grass. Fattening them with nothing but corn makes them sick, but not sick enough to die before being slaughtered for the market.

They also learn (if they hadn't already known it) that corn is in an amazing number of the processed foods in the supermarkets and is the basis of McDonald happy meals. In other words king corn is instrumental in fostering and abetting the obesity epidemic.

The documentary is fascinating because it shows the exact details of how planting, weeding (chemically), fertilizing, harvesting and marketing of the corn is done. There are conversations with farmers and others and the famous food writer Michael Pollan makes an appearance.

This is not a documentary that is going to please the corn industry, but it is not a polemic either. I thought it was fair and accurate as far as I know. I am on the side of more diversified farming organically, but I know that feeding the seven plus billion people on this planet isn't possible without mass agricultural methods such as seen in this video. The fact that our government insists on subsidizing a relatively unhealthy diet based on genetically modified corn and soy is the main culprit. If there were subsidies for farmers to plant a wider variety of crops using organic methods that would improve our diet and allow for sustainable agriculture. The problem with this is we would need a larger percent of the population to farm.

3312134,4,B0012680D0,"I had low expectations when I first started the movie. I knew it would expose corn syrup, because that's been covered so well already. What I found interesting was the way they illustrated the farm subsidy program. Students at my alma mater of Iowa State would be surprised at the easy to understand economics of growing, fertilizing, harvestng and selling corn hecause it was shown in terms of a single acre.
The movie was engaging without being grotesque. Where most documentaries of this nature rely on shock value, especially in the sensitive subject of industrial livestock production, these two guys made their appeal with delicate imagery and used dialogue with local farmers that kept the movie light and interesting. They strayed a bit from the focus on corn producton at times which is why I give it four stars instead of five, but I enjoyed it and learned a few things.

3312149,3,B0012680D0,"I wouldn't say this was a horrible movie, but it certainly wasn't a good one. I think a lot of people think that if the movie's informative or says something you agree with, that makes it a good documentary. I didn't have a problem with the subject matter, it's the way it was presented.

The filmmakers made the choice of inserting themselves into the film. This can be a very effective documentary style (see Michael Moore & Morgan Spurlock for example) but in this case, no offense guys, you just don't have the personality to pull that off. You're not funny, you're not witty, you're not interesting, you're just two dudes floating through this film as if bystanders - which is fine, but then be bystanders, don't be in front of the camera. Don't take offense to that - a lot of people would not be suitable for this type of documentary, including me.

One example: there was a shot in the taxicab where the camera lingers on one of the guys (I don't know their names - and it doesn't matter) presumably to capture his emotional response to some horrible story the driver just told him, yet he's just staring blankly. What emotion was that supposed to be conveying? Either have a reaction worthy of showing us or leave that on the cutting room floor.

Second problem: The filmmakers try to make it look like they're just two schmoes who are clueless about this stuff and are just trying to figure out how corn got into the molecules of their hair. Right. That's insulting our intelligence and just got more & more annoying as the movie went on. You obviously were educated about this topic and that's why you did the movie in the first place.

Third problem: I thought the point of growing an acre of corn was to see what happened to it. But since it's impossible to follow what happened to their one acre of corn because it gets mixed in with everyone else's, that makes that whole part of the movie pointless. At that point they're just doing a more traditional kind of documentary and it was even less important to have them in the story. Yes they still got to show some information about how corn is planted & raised, but they could have shown that, and to better effect, by hanging out with farmers handling real crops.

Fourth problem: I don't remember all the details, but they calculated (spoiler alert?) that if not for the government's checks they would have lost money. Perhaps this is a valid point but using their calculations and drawing conclusions from that is complete B.S. If you were a real farmer, you'd probably own your own equipment, or if not you wouldn't be renting equipment in order to farm one acre of land for 18 minutes. Of course that's not economical!! Fifth problem: Munching into an ear of corn wasn't tasty... well duh, it wasn't sweet corn. There are different varieties of corn. Biting into raw popcorn wouldn't taste good either. That doesn't demonstrate anything one way or the other.

Finally (I could probably go on but I'll just make one more point): What was that ending all about? It was silly and contrived.

Note that nowhere in this comment did I say anything about disagreeing with their message. A good movie could have been made on this subject, but this wasn't it.",1368230400,,3219,4.587826086956522

What a surprise to hear one expert say high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has no nutritional value at all, and another expert mention that the American government, by subsidizing this product (HFCS) is not helping the conditions of diabetes and obesity among Americans.
What is truly saddening is that we as a nation are beyond the point of No Return as far as our being tied to King Corn is concerned.  In some way we are different, and at the same time, similar to the cows in the feed lots: we eagerly consume the corn by-products placed in front of us as ""food"".

3312192,5,B0012680D0,"AbsoLUTEly GREAT movie!  Now I see why my nutritionist tells me not to eat corn!

I grew up on a multi-purpose farm in the 1950s and 60s.  Dad grew all the food for our cattle and other crops to sell:  lots of hay, corn, wheat, and soybeans.  I remember the cattle grazing a lot also.  We had 200 head of cattle in the feedlot - MINUSCULE by today's standards.  I recently have come ""back home"" to northeastern Ohio, to my hometown, and noticed the corn in the fields looks really weird!  The leaves are all pointy and stiff looking - doesn't look at ALL like what Dad grew.

So I asked a farmer friend, ""Is the corn different now, or is it just my imagination?""  ""Nope,"" he said, ""it IS different.  The 'pointy' leaves are designed to catch and hold more water; the seeds have been modified to create more yield per acre.""

Well, now I see why.  Almost ALL the family farms from my childhood are gone; the few that remain have been forced to become ""big business"" operations just like in the movie.  One thing the guys in the movie didn't include in their costs (although maybe it was reflected in the rent they paid) was the incredibly high taxes farmers must pay and the cost of their labor.  One can easily see how ""small"" farming is a losing proposition.

God bless our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents who worked SO hard to give us safer food; many ""thanks"" to the US Government for its (as usual) adverse interventions; and BIG thanks to Ian and Curtis for answering my question of ""What happened to the corn?""",1344470400,2,1530,4.469314079422382

3312194,4,B0012680D0,"Corn is ubiquitous in everything we eat.  It's even the number one nutrient found in our hair.  This documentary sheds new light on our obesity epidemic and how we got so big.
Corn, it's fed to cattle and poultry to fatten it up, and us along with it.

Blame Earl Butz, Nixon's secretary of agriculture.  This elderly gentleman in the movie remembers when he was a kid.  The government paid farmer's not to produce as much corn.
People were less obese back then because food cost more, and now it's much cheaper,  and here we are with two out of three adults overweight.

An acre of corn costs $350 to grow and brings in around $325 on the open market.
Farmers make money off corn from government subsidies which allow them to make around $27 an acre.  So because of this, farms keep getting bigger and bigger, with each corn grower farming thousands of acres.  It only takes 18 minutes to plant 31,000 corn kernals using machinery.  Everything is automated.  Specially hybridized corn can produce a staggering two hundred bushels per acre, as opposed to only forty bushels per acre in the nineteen fifties.

Documentarian Aaron Woolfe may be onto something here.  This is a real eye opener.
There is some great photography of the midwest cornbelt here, and the mountains of corn being spewed out of huge machines onto piles on the ground.

I took off one star because after watching so much corn from every possible aspect, it started to get a bit boring.  I never wanted to see or think about corn again, at least for a while, after watching this. However as a documentary it earns five stars for great photography, and thouroughness in covering the subject.

This really gives me a lot to think about, diet wise.  It seems most of the corn produced isn't even fit to eat, not even by the farmers who grow it.  It tastes awful. But it's used to make food ""products"", corn syrup for instance, and make farmers more money when they sell it to big commercial food industries.

If you need some serious inspiration to start your diet anew this may be it.  Watch out for all that corn.  It's in everything.",1343347200,,2103,4.56951871657754

3312199,5,B0012680D0,"To me this documentary does an excellent job of showing what our society has done to the American farmer and it goes well beyond that point. As both my parents were farmers and I was raised to respect the land, I was sickened to see what the heartland of this country has become, but I cannot deny the truth of this film.
But the real value of this film is what it says about the morality of our society and what we are doing to our youth. We are disregarding our future so that the industrial farm owners can make more money. We are destroying the entire culture of farming. We are placing a dietary poison into our own bodies for the sake of money. We are raising animals in the most inhumane of ways. We are turning our back on the health of our own citizens.
The film presents the material in an honest, clear way. It is not sensationalized, for it lets the material do the talking.
This film is a testimony to the uglier side of capitalism. Of course it's also capitalism which helped produce this film. I hope there will be many viewers and that viewers will vote with their pocketbooks.",1335139200,3,1093,4.336585365853659

It's kind of like oil, when the right gigantic companies own it is when it's a good idea and pushed.  For example why corn?  Milo one of it's relatives can yield just as high,  and yield even more when drought conditions occur.  Milo also used less water and nutrients and less seed is needed.

I wish it wasn't so simple, or that there were other foods subsidized (healthier foods)that would allow a variety in the grocery store.  Enter a supermarket and behold the ""variety.""  Only someone who doesn't know the power and diversification of corn will see variety, well informed people see corn.  I liked how the movie exposed how this could be and why, for it is simple yet innately complex.

3312203,4,B0012680D0,"I did not set out to watch a documentary on the state of American food, i was bored one morning, and thanks to the free streaming of Amazon Prime i stumbled upon it.

If you are expecting a fast paced, information based documentary in the style of Michael Moore, then this is not the one.  You have two guys that try to follow the corn chain from growth to consumption by renting an acre of land and doing it themselves.  There is a lot of sentimentality regarding the loss of family farms through the generations, but little sympathy can be evoked.

The amount of products that has corn in its process at some point is staggering.  I find myself reading the labels in my larder now and being shocked at the amount of times i read ""corn"" popping up everywhere.

Fascinating documentary and if you find yourself with 90minutes to kill, then you could do a lot worse",1328400000,,864,4.436708860759493
3312204,3,B0012680D0,"Basic presentation is the purchase of an acre of land in Greene, Iowa for the production of corn and to watch were the corn goes.

We see how corn has been genetic lay altered for better or worse. There are two sides to genetic and we only see one. Our presenters spit their Cornell thing you taste like chalk. But I can go down to the local store and pioneer of corn peel back the leaves, removed some of the silk, and munch away. In fact I use it many times just as a meal.

We learn how to make corn syrup in the kitchen sink. We find this corn syrup in the soda we drink. However the argument that they bring up against corn syrup can easily be turned in to an argument against sugar. Speaking of sugar with a little bit of research you can find versions of Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper made with real sugar. And it will easily pass the blind taste test. Coca-Cola knowing that people could tell the difference pulled the real thing off the market replacing it with New Coke and when all the sugar drinks for off the market replace them with corn syrup with the misnomer of Classic Coke. If you switch to Izze esque you just get 50 calories of fruit juice.

There is a small reference to ethanol which is being used as an excuse to raise the price of corn in food. We all know that we can get cheaper sugar from other countries and make cheaper ethanol and lower the price of corn to make cheaper foods.

There are some vulgar scenes of reaching into cow stomachs that you may want to fast forward through. However in the process they make you understand that too much corn is not that good for cows and cows full of corn are not good for people. And again they forget to tell you with a little research you can find grass fed meat. You might also find Buffalo more to your liking then cows.

This film does not tell us anything we do not already know.  But it can be overwhelming to see it all in one film. The presentation written by Aaron Woolf, Ian Cheney, Curt Ellis and Jeffery K. Miller, seems to lose focus now and then; it is part documentary, part mockumentary and par ""who do you think you are?""  This film is still worth watching but every once in a while you wonder if they know for whom they are making it.

What I find fascinating about this presentation is that years ago we used to say we were eating oil as that is what the fertilizer is made of that we use to make corn and lose some of the energy on the way.

I always wonder if films like this ever change things or if they are ever viewed by the people that created this monstrosity? It is like watching the bad guy and not realizing they are talking about you.

For people interested in the media the pictures are crisp the background music does not drowned out the speakers.  There are the standard Bonus Materials as carrying their corn to the Chicago Board of Trade. Subsides are explained in Washington.  And so on.",1328227200,,2891,4.236363636363636

It also puts a very human face on the ""corporate"" farms where all of this corn is coming from.  Those are real, likeable people growing that corn.

It turns out that corn pretty much goes everywhere, and as a result, is being consumed by humans at too high a level. It also turns out that this level is far too high to be healthy for any person. The sources of these problems rest with the food companies  who have identified many means through which corn could be used to make food production less costly.

3312213,1,B0012680D0,"I watched this snorefest at the behest of a friend who couldn't stop talking about how great it was. The short review is, ""See `Food, Inc.' instead. Or read books by noted authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser, which are packed with useful and, in many cases, lifestyle-changing bits of info.""

But because ""King Corn"" is being billed as a ""documentary"", let's take a good ol' fashioned gander at what exactly is being documented here.

The story opens in the offices of a man who is never named or otherwise identified (physicist? college professor? grad student with 24-7 lab access?), who performs a RIVETING, off-camera isotopic hair analysis on documentarians/stars Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis. The analysis produces some likewise earth-shattering results: Cheney and Ellis find that approximately 60% of their hair contains the isotopic signature of (drumroll) corn.

Astonishing! Or, it would be, if corn derivatives were not already found in numerous shampoos (though on most product labels it appears as ""hydrolyzed vegetable proteins"") as well as in cosmetics and other things we rub into our hair and/or our bodies. But no one ever tells you that their shampoo or foundation gave them diabetes, or made them fat.

Cheney and Ellis's riveting search for answers to this isotopic dilemma takes them to their natal country, the land of their birthright, reposing amidst the emerald splendours of Iowa's scenic ""corn belt"", which comprises the entire state.

Verily, I sing to thee of Greene, Iowa.

Jewel of Butler County, Greene is set in the midst of such dazzling cosmopolitan centers as New Hartford and Parkersburg. Cheney and Ellis contact a local farmer in advance of their arrival in riveting, stunning Iowa, and ask his express permission to use one acre of his land in order to grow corn. That single acre forms the catalyst which springboards our dynamic duo into a new world of exciting knowledge and brilliantly provocative socio-economic and nutritional insights, as they proceed to:

1.) Tour the vicinity of Greene, taking in breathtaking vistas of corn-related scenery

2.) Talk to a state licensed agricultural advisor at a seed wholesaler's shop about what kind of dirt their acre of land contains, and how they ought to plant corn in it

3.) Drive a big tractor over their acre to create furrows to plant corn in

4.) Plant corn in their acre

5.) Fertilize their corn kernels

6.) Wait for their corn to grow

7.) Talk to some local farmers who also grow corn and/or raise cattle about some of the issues currently plaguing the commercial farming industry (whence arrives the shocking Verdict: the procedures which the corporate ""Big Farming"" consortiums use to produce tremendous amounts of corn are harmful to the average corn consumer, to the environment, and to the cornfed cattle being consumed by the average corn consumer... info we've been aware of for the past couple of decades, at least)

8.) Find an absolutely riveting hemp plant growing in the midst of their corn (there is an entire scene devoted to this)

9.) Wait some more for their corn to grow

10.) Talk to random, unidentified persons in fast food restaurant parking lots who seem to possess a lot of ""big picture"" knowledge concerning the corn- and cattle-farming industries

11.) Wait some more for their corn to grow

12.) Use a montage of ""cold call"" footage to document their efforts to bring a camera crew to a factory that makes corn syrup, which are mercilessly thwarted by the point blank refusals of corporate PR depts. This is something which this documentary attempts to cast in a suspicion-rousing, chin-pulling, ""Hmm, what is this industry hiding from us"" light - when the fact is, almost any factory would flatly refuse to allow total strangers calling on the phone to just show up with a camera crew at the factory doors and tour the plant, because it so happens that this is a great way for competing companies to observe and film certain time-saving and/or money-saving copyrighted manufacturing processes which would then give them an edge in the market.

13.) Get bored waiting for their corn to grow tall, and start playing impromptu baseball games in order to pass the time.

14.) Build a baseball diamond in the middle of their cornfield (No, wait, that was `Field of Dreams')

15.) Direct sidelong glances of counterfeit ""say what?"" toward one another during interviews in which an expert informs them that the strain of corn being grown in Iowa has no nutritional value whatsoever

16.) Watch their corn grow tall

17.) Use riveting stop-motion animations of corn kernels that spread across a map in brushfire fashion, or else march in front of the camera in neat, little lines, to illustrate their brilliant points

18.) Harvest their corn

19.) Masticate some of their corn and quickly come to the realization that it is inedible, unless it is heavily processed first

20.) Interview a New York cabbie who propounds the theory that consuming too much soda made him and his immediate family diabetic and obese

21.) Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....

So, to sum up, a few snippets of an interview with author Michael Pollan (In Defense of Food) do not make this worth an hour and thirty minutes of your time.

3312216,5,B0012680D0,"This was a really nice film to watch. The creators seemed to be natural at documentary film making. There were lots of nice heartwarming and personal interviews and lots of really nice imagery, especially for people who like stop motion and time lapse motion photography. The journey of this story was very interesting as well as very nostalgic. It offered a really nice glimpse into a part of the American heritages of old to new. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I think the creators should take on another subject to document as they made a great duo of filming, interviewing collaborators offering a personal hand story. I don't know the history of the success of this film but I would venture to say that it is probably an award winning film. I would recommend this film.",1306972800,,775,4.705882352941177
3312217,2,B0012680D0,"I thought this movie had potential to be a lot more interesting, informative and entertaining.  Unfortunately the creators included far too much filler and down time footage; it slowed down the pace immensely and made it difficult to sit through.  It's not until halfway through the film do we start learning more interesting factoids about HFCS and its impact on farming.

It seemed like they were trying to make two separate documentaries at once.  One story focused on them; exploring their roots, returning to their grandparent's home town, learning about their family history and how farming has changed over the years.  The other story focused on corn; where it comes from, where it goes and how it finds its way into almost everything we consume.

Because of these two competing story lines I felt that the documentary became watered down.  The movie dragged quite a bit and I think that time could have been better served to provide more information and ask deeper questions.  The movie only managed to pique my interest on the issue rather than provide me with good explanations or answers.",1306022400,,1099,4.934782608695652

3312219,4,B0012680D0,"I would be much more interested in documentaries if more were formatted in similar ways to King Corn.  I appreciated knowing the background stories of the college guys and the way that they came about project.  It is much easier for me to watch a documentary understanding that the producers are simply discovering and sharing information as opposed to indoctrinating their viewers based on a personal bias.  I was also impressed by the credibility of the information that came from this film. From my personal experience, because fewer members of our society are growing up around agriculture, there is a large and growing disconnect between the metropolitan consumer and the country farmer.  I personally view the gap as big enough as to represent 2 completely different cultures in their own right.  I also believe that as of late, much of the information on modern farming has come from 'urbanites' who in some cases may have the right information, but they frequently tear it out of its proper context.  Coming from a farming background, I was initially nervous that this movie would ignorantly bash farmers and the agricultural community, but I found it incredibly refreshing to watch the facts being displayed honoring farmers way of life and small-town culture, while showing their honest disdain in being part of a system that for decades has rewarded the wrong metrics. It was the first documentary in which I could feel that a producer not initially familiar with agricultural community, came away from the experience ""getting us.""

As an advocate of the free-market, I found myself repeatedly agreeing with the conclusions of the producers, that the reason of our overproduction of corn is due to government subsidies.  Corn isn't the enemy per say, its simply that its recent overproduction is due to the fact that farmers are being paid over and above its true market value by the government to produce the crop. Without subsidies, corn demand would decrease as the price of corn rose, and the market would provide be able to provide real alternatives that were economically sustainable for farmers to grow, manufacturers to produce, and consumers to consume.

3312225,5,B0012680D0,"I have an interest in these sorts of independent documentaries, but I always approach with caution. A lot of liberals and others with questionable motives use documentaries to express themselves, which of course is fine. I am not interested in having the producer of a documentary trying to manipulate the way I think, which is why I like factual documentaries. With this film, I suspected I might not like it, even 30 minutes into it I was not sure if I would finish it, but I did. I am glad I did, it was very informative and I really enjoyed it. It is a shame to see what is happening to our food.

In a real sense, the film is conservative (but not necessarily in a political way, perhaps ""philosophically traditional"" is better) in essence. It drives home the point that government is the problem. Due to government subsidies and such, the markets are not balanced in a natural way. The government should really stop this nonsense before the damage is irreparable or extremely painful. If most of our food is made from corn, were the price of corn to shoot up (i.e. if subsidies stopped) then so would the price of food. Presenting us with be a very bad situation. This of course goes without mentioning the danger to health from having a largely corn based diet.

3312226,5,B0012680D0,"Is there a bigger plan for our diets? Is there a food and agriculture conspiracy? Is the food industry in cohoots with big pharma so that we have all the drugs we need to treat ourselves after a lifetime of eating ""crap""? It's really not that difficult to understand that creating really cheap food market prices by using corn in practically everything is an easy out for our country's farmers. But therein does NOT lie the problem.
Another farmer in this movie was specific in that if American people want grass fed beef, that's what farmers would produce, but since Americans either do want only cheap food or have no idea what they want, the market will continue to inundate our diets with what this movie is titled, King Corn.
Just like gasoline, it seems that a disaster of epic proportions is going to have to bring down an industry that does nothing to stop itself from producing the ""crap"" that the farmer stated in my title box. While barely any alternatives for gasoline and its resulting carbon emissions exist today, we're a bit more lucky with food because of the organic movement in the US. But it's not enough as more people are out of work and can't afford the prices organic food demands, or is THAT a misconception as well??
In any case, buy this movie, see it, share it, the message is clear......stopping ourselves from consuming as much corn as we do wouldn't hurt any farmers, it would demand a change in what they produce. It's up to us. If we want better food, it WILL cost more at first because supply can't meet demand.

Its sold along side FOOD INC., and FOOD MATTERS ... which I bought and found both HIGHLY informative and interesting.  This film was neither.  To sell this production along side both of the former titles would imply that they are related.  If it were not for the mere fact that the main focus of the film was a food item then these three titles would have NO common link at all.  I was expecting to find another harsh expose' on the corn industry and plant exposing all its evils wrought unto mankind.  NOPE ... What I got was a sappy story of two nerdy twenty somethings rediscovering their roots ... if it were to stand alone, its still not even a decent documentary.  The segments are disjointed and you have no sense of linear story telling or continuity.  They jump around so much that I honestly fell asleep 20 mins into the movie... slept for 40 and woke up and felt as thought I missed NOTHING.  Two things stand out that I can praise about the film.  The Section about Secretary Buts and the boys actually visit the retired man living in an assisted living facility well into his 80's/90's by this point.  His interview showcases a man that still believes he did the right thing at the time and although the outcome may not have been what he had foreseen (GLUTTONY and SLOTH) He still stands proud as a man that affected change in this country, right or wrong, to provide the lowest costing food ever.  Also the story of Farmer Payatt who humored the two spoiled brats by allowing them to plant an acre of corn on his farm .  My heart truly bled for him at the end of the film when I realized that his was the farm up for auction, even though  they were deep into the scene before that was even apparent.  Again, as through the rest of their work, I suppose the filmmakers just wanted the audience to guess what the hell was going on during the climax of their presentation ...

One can of soda a day, with high fructose corn syrup, doubles your risk for diabetes.  Because people are getting hip to the dangers of HFCS, high fructose corn syrup, HFCS is being rebranded as ""Corn Sugar.""  Really, though, HFCS by any name is toxic.

I don't want to get into a lengthy review because other reviewers before me have done quite well, but the affect that corn has on what seems to be pretty much everything is mind numbing. The health concerns that are raised over how it is used (corn fed beef, high fructose corn syrup, etc), especially the hypothesis that this will be the first generation that has a lower life expectancy than the generation previous is quite frightening.

3312239,5,B0012680D0,"King Corn tells the truth.  No one in my area wants to rent a farm with farm buildings.  Farm management experts at [...] advise tearing down most, if not all, buildings. At one time there were neighboring 'ghost farmsteads' with trees, orchards, but no mailboxes.  Most of those remnants are now gone.

I've burned down all my wooden buildings, except for the 'century house'.  I'm 75.  When I'm gone someone else can raze that.

The impoverishment and de-humanizing of Iowa is deliberate government policy, the opposite of some European countries.  Our present system does work well for huge agricultural supply and commodity conglomerates.

High tarrifs on imported cane sugar exacerbate the problem. The goal is to keep Americans eating inferior corn sugar products at protected prices.

It takes a lifetime of on-farm experience to successfully operate a viable 'sustainable agriculture' farm.  Such expertise is dying or dead.  Iowans raise 'export kids' to find careers in other states.

The DVD 'King Corn' tells the true story on many levels.  The rationale for providing much food at low cost is deeply flawed and unsustainable, but highly appealing to the 'sound bite' crowd.  Food that is truly 'good for you' may cost twice as much in stores and four times as much in restaurants.

I was amazed that we have a surplus of corn yet American crops are still being forced to produce more corn....and a type of corn that isn't EVEN eatable is retarded. The corn has to be processed at a plant owned by corrupt business owners who dictate once again what will be done with all this corn and how to incorporate it into our daily diet and into almost every possible food you purchase on a regular grocery store shelf. Amazing enough corn has no dietary benefits to our diet and makes obesity skyrocket in America; and other nations who drink soda...which is almost pure high fructose corn syrup. This is bad politics, bad for our environment, bad for our bodies, simply bad economics and use of our American soil. We should let farmers grow a variety of food and that way we can survive more efficacy off the land. An eye opener on why obesity and healthy issues occur and the misguided information on eating healthy and having a variety of food choices....but EVERYTHING HAS CORN in it... EVEN OUR BEEF!!! Educational for sure. If you want to be healthy learn what they do to your food before these corporations feed you their ill products that will only cause you health problems down the road and then you'll be hooked into buying prescribed medication to fix all your problems that they created anyways.

The film makers do not have college degrees even remotely related to agriculture, and are not involved in it day to day.  They are right in pointing out that Americans demand cheap food, and ranchers like me have to take the steps neccessary to deliver and stay in a margin of profit (which is not much on any given year).  If Americans paid more for food, then production would be different.  We do what we have to, and you cant be on the outside and judge if you are not a farmer or rancher yourself.

3312255,5,B0012680D0,"King Corn really isn't fairly categorized as a little brother of Supersize Me.  It is an entertaining though disturbing documentary that is more accurately categorized with other food INDUSTRY documentaries, such as Food, Inc. or The World According to Monsanto (both alarming and eye-opening as well).
Supersize Me is wonderful for following, in one man, the appalling health deterioration born of eating only corn (okay, of eating only McDonald's, but watch King Corn, and you'll see the direct parallel), but Supersize Me doesn't cover how the US government indirectly yet absolutely funds the fast food industry and almost every packaged, processed, unhealthy food on the market by subsidizing the commodity crops that are those foods' core ingredients.

Watch King Corn.  Then watch Supersize Me again (or for the first time--it's REALLY entertaining).  And this time you'll understand WHY it costs McDonald's only five cents for every twenty five cent Supersize they're able to sell.  It's because corn is subsidized; it's cheap.  And corn is in EVERYTHING they serve.

And by the way, the irony of this in the midst of our current healthcare battle is tremendous.  Government pays for the creation of cheap, abundant, crappy food that makes our bodies obese, diabetic, and sick, then Congress fights about how to fund the ever-growing healthcare burden of obese, diabetic, sick patients.  Regardless of HOW we fund it, we're fighting about the pound of cure.  I don't argue that government should strip farm subsidies.  But if we're really going to argue about the cost of healthcare, we should be fighting about how to better use farm subsidy funds to grow healthy food.

3312258,4,B0012680D0,"For those who were shocked and amazed by the workings of the food industry in the documentary Food, Inc. There is another little known film that came out in 2006 that serves as a sort of compendium project. King Corn documents a year in the life of two Bostonians who lease an acre of land in Iowa to grow a crop of corn.

Ironically, the college chums, a couple of likeable fellows with an affinity for whiffle-ball and fast food, both had a great grandfather from the same county in Iowa. So once the two find a landowner to lease them the property and a farmer to help them plant their crop, they start to explore not only their familial roots, but the roots of the corn industry. As the corn grows, so does their search, bringing them to some truly eye-opening realizations about the US food industry.

Though a lot of the information has been touched on in films like Food, Inc. and Super Size Me as well as books like Fast Food Nation and The Omnivore's Dilemma, King Corn delivers it from a different perspective. By telling the story from a would-be farmer's perspective, the filmmakers are just as amazed as we are when they learn firsthand some of the inner workings of the agricultural industry. From the realization that US farmers are paid primarily through government subsidies since they often actually lose money on their crops to the fact that the majority of corn grown in Iowa is so genetically altered that it is not suitable to be eaten, even for those who have heard this information before, the film delivers it in such a compelling way that it seems fresh and consistently alarming.

The filmmakers deliver an evenhanded expose of the corn industry that doesn't seem as scathing as so many documentaries of late have. Nevertheless, by the end, when they actually have to take their harvest to market, you can really feel their heartbreak as they sell their prize crop with no idea where it will be going or what it will be used for. Will it be one of the 20,000 acres of corn it takes just to sweeten the sodas consumed in Brooklyn, NY in one year? Will it be used to quickly fatten up cattle? Or will it be used in one of the thousands of other food products made primarily of corn?

The film points out that we now spend less of our income on food than any generation in history, and fewer of us are needed to produce that food. However, considering that we are sacrificing so much of the nutritional value to keep costs down in a society with an explosion of problems like obesity and obesity, we have to wonder if we shouldn't reconsider our food budget. As one interviewee says of the government agricultural subsidies, ""We subsidize the Happy Meals, but we don't subsidize the healthy ones."" And yet so many of the farmers in the film insisted that if the American people demanded healthy food, they would be glad to grow it, but the current schism of quickly grown, high yield, low nutrition agriculture is going to be hard to break from. Nevertheless, considering that the impetus for the film was the realization that for the first time in history, this generation's life expectancy is lower than the generation before, our diets need to become a higher priority.",1255651200,8,3196,4.5821678321678325

Usually with documentaries there is a complete one-sided view that typically bashes the other side. This one doesn't do that, instead it asks questions and seeks to find the answers. While I knew that corn syrup was in a good chunk of all the foods that are out there, I didn't realize it comes from mass produced corn that is inedible. Everything that they found while on their ""down time"" after planting 31,000 genetically modified seed in 18 minutes they traveled around the country to find out where the corn they grow ends up. This part of the movie was quite interesting but it seemed to point out this is a huge chunk of problem we have with obestity in this country, there are numerous other factors.

Overall, I would watch this movie again even if it wasn't required. Since I needed to take notes on the film, I had a friend (not in my class) watch it as well and they were equally impressed.

wonderful, as well as the animations that they did with a still camera.

3312262,4,B0012680D0,"The documentary KING CORN follows Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, young friends who live in Boston, to the cornfields of Iowa, where they learn about the state of farming - corn farming, to be exact - in the United States. KING CORN confirms what you've heard about high fructose corn syrup, one major result of the post-1970s corn glut, but includes information you may not have.

Almost as remarkable as KING CORN's take on the worrisome corn-dominated American diet are the film's hosts, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis.  Because they are not journalists, Cheney and Ellis are not making KING CORN as a natural extension of gathering news the way Michael Moore does in documentaries such as ROGER AND ME and SICKO.  Both Boston, Massachusetts, city dwellers, Cheney and Ellis are not even farmers.  The entertaining personalities of these young men make KING CORN even easier to view as we watch them farm their own acre of land.  KING CORN could get away with a simple voice-over narration as it outlines the facts about America's food crisis, but Cheney and Ellis make it that much more interesting without becoming a distraction.  They even prove able skit players in the KING CORN D.V.D. extras.

Mention the name Earl Butz and KING CORN now competes with the late secretary of agriculture's famously ignorant remark about African Americans as the first thought to come to mind.  KING CORN points to Butz's 1970s drive to make American corn abundantly cheap as the start of America's bad diet.  Butz, whom KING CORN interviews prior to his 2008 death, still brags that the American corn-ucopia makes food inexpensive.  Either he does not see or won't admit that corn's profusion  changes it from food to just a raw material, the resulting high fructose corn syrup explosion contributing to record weight gain in America.  What good is low-priced food that leads to diabetes and heart disease?  In the long run, isn't it costing Americans more?

This movie picks up on that subject matter with a in-depth look at corn and the industry.  It is done with some sense of humor about the subect matter, but ultimately it is an eye opener and somewhat scary.

From the ramifications of where corn is used and how how in contributes to health issues ranging from obesity to chaning the feed for livestock, the movie is encompassing in getting the message across and shedding light on the industry in a manner that is not quick as hard handed as some others in this genre, but just as effective.",1249948800,2,803,4.47945205479452

Michael Pollan is actually in the movie and if you've read the book you will like how the movie dovetails nicely with his writing.  It still manages to be homey and entertaining while teaching you that corn is the basis for our food industry and why this is problematic.  A few things you will learn:

1) Corn is in EVERTHING we eat, from our soda sweetened with high fructose corn syrup to our meat as almost all the animals we eat are corn-fed. Corn fed animals are not natural, cows don't have the digestive tracts to process corn, they are meant to eat grass.  A corn fed diet must be supplemented with antibiotics to keep the cows alive as corn eventually kills them.  According to the movie, 70% of antibiotics in the US are fed to animals grown for human consumption.

2) In the last several decades self-sufficient family farms have gone the way of the dinosaur because the best way for a farmer to eek out a living is to grow Corn on every square inch of land thanks to our unsustainable agricultural policies.

3) Corn has been genetically altered to the point where industrial corn grown on farms really can't be eaten until it has been processed with all sorts of nasty chemicals to break it down into all kinds of weird food products.

King Corn is really sort of gentle expose on what is wrong with our food system.",1248134400,5,1415,4.474708171206226
3312265,4,B0012680D0,"This is exactly what I would want from this film. Cheney and Ellis spoke calmly. They were respectful, civil or polite with everyone they spoke with.  They did not scream an agenda at their audience and they seemed to have successfully sought out open and honest input from all quarters. I respect that.

It's worth noting that in the scenes that made the final cut I only counted one of what struck me as a blatant moment of putting an idea in for those who aren't thinking for themselves (something many well known ""documentaries"" are riddled with).  And lets think about that.  Who is out there seeking out documentaries about where their food comes from that isn't trying to think for themselves.  So it makes perfect sense that tasting dent corn right off the cob long before it is ready for a dried harvest makes for a yuck experience?  I'm sure everyone could figure that out and would figure it out well enough to grow sweet corn if they wanted it to taste good for fresh eating.

Although I already knew a good bit of what was presented, there was still benefit to me from watching it in the way that these two men presented it.  Also, there were some surprising things that I did not know ahead of time and enjoyed learning.

I'm a wife, homeschooling mother, homemaker as well as a foodie, a novice gardener and a home cook with a passion for cooking from scratch and collecting cookbooks.  This documentary really put some drive in me to make more changes to my diet, specifically to start buying grass-fed beef a side at a time. This is something I've wanted to do and thought would be a healthful change for years now, but I haven't acted on it beyond buying a deep freeze and then not filling it with pastured beef and poultry.  But two weeks ago I bought my first pastured poultry from a local man who only has an acre but is getting back to the land in his own way and this coming fall I am going to buy my first side of beef from a local grass-feeding cattle farmer.

3312271,4,B0012680D0,"Two friends from college decided to track the process of growing America's #1 crop - corn. We see them rent their own acre of land and start, literally from scratch.

They learn some of the evils and the economies of what has become the big business of agriculture - in some ways following in the footsteps of Roger Moore. They produce an eye-opening documentary. However these two pals do their investigating in a hands-on, non-confrontational way. As much as possible, they become a part of the Iowa community where they start their jovially hip adventure.

They usher us through the process of sowing and reaping the corn, as it is done now with giant combines yielding billions of tons of grain every year. Then the friends pursue their crop as it is traded and processed, and as it makes its way to our tables in one form or another.

They show how ubiquitous a part of our lives corn is. It is added as sweetener to almost all the processed food products we eat now, perhaps contributing to the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. It is the staple ingredient in most cattle feed. All of this commercial corn is foul-tasting, almost inedible in its primary raw state.

The two young men do a good job of showing the details of the journey the corn makes from seed to feed. They include the way the crop is fertilized using ammonia. They touch on the herbicides sprayed on the fields and how these chemicals do their work of eradicating weeds without harming the young corn shoots. However, there's one glaring omission. The pals don't discuss pesticides at all, and seem not to have used any on their God's Little Acre.

But the two also take the larger view. They probe the different philosophies that have guided Government programs dealing with farmers. They even track down Earl Butz, the controversial Secretary of Agriculture in the Nixon-Ford Administration, and interview him. He explains how he revamped and reversed the system of incentives given to farmers. He saw that they were paid, not for how much land they withheld from production, but for how much land they planted. This policy has contributed to the near-glut of corn on the market and to the creation of vast monoculture farms.

There's a wealth of information in this documentary, presented in a lively, engaging way. The pals in effect take a cheery road trip with each other and with their corn - but make some sobering discoveries along the way.",1233532800,,2425,4.734597156398104

My friend and this film gave me a whole new appreciation of just how ubiquitous corn is in our diet. It's nearly impossible to avoid corn in so many commercial products it's insane. It also becomes obvious it's certainly not wise to have our nations figurative eggs in so few crop-baskets, virtual mono cultures. I'm old enough to remember grass finished beef, and prefer it, and think it's beyond egregious that animals are subjected to CAFO's and factory slaugher houses that regularly have to recall hundreds of thousands of pounds of meat due to contamination. The waste is totally unacceptable and now Mexico won't accept meat from many of our processors. This traces back to the ubiquitous use of corn and factory farming. Besides the unnatural corn in cattle rations there are other ""proteins"" including processed road kill and euthanized pets. The epidemic rise if type II diabetes in this country must be tied to so much corn and sweetener/browner/filler/starch as before the use of so much corn, diabetes was fairly UNcommon. The corn syrup seems to upset the metabolic system and contributes to obesity. I do wish that movie had addressed the issues surrounding GMO corn. But then, the lawsuits might have started rolling in. Corn that kills the earworm isn't something I want on my menu. I realize that bacterium thuringensis is fairly harmless when used as a dust on corn silks, but who knows what the effect is when it's built into every single kernel we eat of that particular modificication. That said the movie is easy watching with compassion for those who are being forced out of a way of life lived happily for generations and even out of small towns where generations have lived. It is an appeal for America to come to it's senses and have a good look around. We're very soon going to need the jobs small farms provide AND food we can actually eat might be handy!",1231113600,,1994,4.765895953757226
3312275,5,B0012680D0,"King Corn is a very informative, and sightly disturbing documentary about the American food chain. Two friends from the city travel west to the small town of Greene, Iowa to plant one acre of corn. They do this to try and learn, and show others, what corn farming has become. While in that small town, they interview many wonderful farmers and even see some old family photos. By strange coincidence, the friends who did this documentary both had relatives in this very small town. They do all this while they grow their corn, and sell it on the corn market. They document this whole process very well, and turn it into the documentary: King Corn.

  Riddled with many facts, statistics, interviews with corn farmers, and stop motion with corn kernels, King corn informs you of the many problems with American Food. First off, corn is in almost everything we eat, the average American even has corn in their hair. Then it tells of the large amounts of pesticides and chemicals used to grow corn. They can not be good for the health of the corn plant, or the health of the organisms who consume it. It also discuses how terrible a diet of corn is for cattle, and that nearly every cattle farm in America feeds their cattle corn. In addition to all this, the documentary is funny, has a very personal and small-town-America edge to it. All of this, and more, combine to make this an excellent documentary.  It has really made me question th quality of the food I eat. I highly recomend this documentary to any person who has ever questioned the quality of their food, or just wants to be educated about this important subject. Informative and entertaining, King Corn is an excellent documentary that any person can enjoy.",1230940800,,1719,4.663366336633663
3312276,5,B0012680D0,The video depicts the production of corn from start to finish and our reliance on the product as a nation and with the world.  Amazing that the analysis on hair shows corn as part of the makeup. It was terrific to have the video shot in our area with people we know. Greatly informative for all.,1230681600,,295,4.267857142857143
3312277,4,B0012680D0,"Watching a documentary about the effects of corn on the American diet was not something I thought I would ever accomplish. It just didn't seem very interesting, but I figured I'd give it a viewing and am glad I did. The filmmakers, Curt and Ian, take a seemingly boring subject and inject it with humor and surprising facts. Their behind the scenes view of the insurgence of corn into the diets of so many people is quite surprising and sad at the same time. The honesty that they are able to extract from the very farmers who grow the corn is astounding, as I thought they would defend their product vehemently. However, the farmers seemed to really understand where the filmmakers were taking their story and were willing to share the truth, admitting they were part of the problem.

Facts abound, as is usual for a documentary, but are portrayed using ""cute"" stop motion photography with candy corn and Little People playsets, making them light and fun.

Although the movie did tend to bloat around the middle part, just like the American waistline, it picked right up and ended strong. The final shot of Curt and Ian purchasing the acre of land and deciding to plant grass was very poignant and touching at the same time.

I recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in what they consume or the history of farming in America.",1229299200,,1338,4.637130801687764
3312278,5,B0012680D0,"This movie feels like I'm hearing a story told by an old college buddy. It's pretty objective, just relating their experience without preaching, facts are presented as facts and not interpreted, they leave that to the audience. Great way to introduce beginners to the prevalence of CORN in our modern (American) society.",1227398400,,320,5.173076923076923
3312279,5,B0012680D0,"This movie should be required for every person in America. Do we have an obesity epidemic?  Just look around you next time you are in a fast food restaurant, Walmart, or other bastion of food eaters. There is a reason why we get fat and it is called high frictous corn syrup.  Try and find something in a grocery store without it; good luck.  This movie looks at the cause of it through the use of our corn harvest.  Scientifically you could be said to be primarily corn as that is the vast majority of what is eaten no matter what your eating habits are.  If you are a vegetarian you are even more likely to have issues.  This movie is not for the faint heart who do not want to learn the truth.",1227398400,,696,4.156716417910448
3312281,5,B0012680D0,"I recently showed this film to my local dietitian group, and not only did it get two thumbs up, but we agreed that this is a film everyone should see.  This is like the cliff note version for Michael Pollan's excellent book Omnivores Dilemma. Start with the film and if you want to know more, read the book.

King Corn is about two friends who decide to grow corn on an acre of land in Iowa to learn more about how our food system works. They spend a year going through the full growing cycle as well as following where that corn goes (or is likely to go) in the food chain. In their quietly understated way, they tell a story that is disturbing and in the end really grabs you. At least it did me, and I already knew this stuff. Somehow seeing it in the documentary format made it really hit home.

This is well worth the price and the 90 minute running time. It will give you new insight into what you are eating, and is something you'll want to share with friends.",1227312000,,967,4.188172043010753

3312283,4,B0012680D0,"A documentary about Corn.  The turning point of the story begins when Republican Earl Butz ushers in the ""Get big or get out"" era.  The idea was to reduce subsidies by dramatically increasing subsidies. (technically there would be fewer farmers receiving subsidies when there are fewer remaining farmers).

The older townsfolk interviewed don't come off as cynical.  They come off as fatalistically pragmatic.  Both dependent on large subsidies and likely to be run out of business by people better at lining up subsidies and agribusiness contracts, they all know it is the only game in town.

In the end King Corn enables the cheap production of massive amounts of meat and corn syrup.  Even most of the poorest americans can now afford to feed themselves into 280 pound bodies and diabetes.  We wouldn't have our massive number of fast food restaurants and ubiquitous chain restaurants without King Corn.  Those restaurants provide jobs people need: They sure aren't going to be farmers, grocers, or butchers.",1225756800,3,1011,5.115853658536586

It also showed me that agriculture in this country is not on the right course and is contributing to the degredation of our nation, the world and the environment.  Slightly misleading, however, is the fact that it is listed as ""by Michael Pollan"", which is is not... he is just a guest speaker of sorts.  That was why I purchased the movie, and though feeling misled I still REALLY liked the movie. A must-see for everyone.",1220054400,,493,4.455555555555556

3312288,3,B0012680D0,"is that CORN FARMERS, or farmers who grow ANYTHING, grow what makes money. Crops are subsidized so the gov't can keep control. Control how much is grown (acres), control the prices, and make sure they are ""nicey nicey"" to other countries and buy commodities from them. I want to laugh and say, if you could get a promotion and make more money, would you do it? Why should a farmer not do what makes them money? DUH! If commodities could be sold in a free market economy, it would be great. We don't want subsidies, we want a free market and the government's hand out of our business.

Many farmers in the western high plains are barely making it. They're not rolling in money, they don't have retirement plans, they don't have many of the luxuries you city dwellers (and not self-employed workers) have....you work for someone who pays for your health insurance and offers a 401k? Must be nice! You worry about how much gas cost in your little car? Must be nice.....we spend THOUSANDS in fuel each month.

I am not saying that they don't have some valid points, especially regarding the over processed food we eat. But its pretty ignorant to ""blame corn"" over it. 99.9% of my crop feeds cattle. Cattle ranchers would like to make money too, and feeding corn is more profitable in the long run than grass...besides, I hate to break the news to you, there is not an abundance of grassland in the country. You want exclusively grass fed cattle? Be prepared to pay....a lot!

So before you go jumping on the anti-corn, anti-farmer bandwagon, make sure you have ""walked a mile"" in a farmer's shoes.",1216684800,8,1593,4.602112676056338

The interviews with farmers, professors from the university, and food industry professionals is very interesting.  I also looked up the King Corn website and was intriguied by the challenge to go 'corn free'  which for me meant really taking a look at all the products I eat which contain corn.  Perhaps a word of caution when you get to the feed lot portion of the documentary.  I had absolutely no idea cattle were raised like this and the impact that eating corn based diets has on them.  It has really put me off eating beef.  I feel this topic needs to become more mainstream so everyone is aware of the impact of their choices on their health.  And if I could encourage people to do one thing to change their diet - stop drinking sodas!!!!!",1214956800,,894,4.5375
