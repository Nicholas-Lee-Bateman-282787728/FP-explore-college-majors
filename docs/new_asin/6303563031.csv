700701,1,6303563031,"Some people might call this a ""B"" grade movie. Personally I do not believe it rises to that level. A very bad RoboCop in a Military setting. Soldiers wear something that resembles recycled football pad - come to think of the some of the actors resemble recycled football players.",1369094400,,279,4.714285714285714
700702,5,6303563031,"While the brothers Sid we doing a power search to unlock some B gold we happened to stumble across a film we'd had no prior knowledge of featuring quite possible the world's greatest actor Mr. Don Swayze. It's been a couple years since we've watched anything featuring our all time favorite screen legend and knew this was an opportunity not to be passed on. Without even reading the synopsis we simply hit play and were blown away by a story so hilariously bad it leaped far beyond our expectations. Outside of the Swayze factor we were floored to see a surprise guest cameos from Clint Howard and Larry from Summer School as the lead role. The on screen chemistry between Howard and Swayze could easily rival what Chad and Don have blessed us with in the past, and trust us that is saying a lot.

Digital man kicks off with special effects of such poor quality you'd swear you were looking at a Sega Genesis game from 1993. The ship contains a group on cyborgs led by Larry as they prepare to save the human race from the wrath of Digital Man. As they stalk Digital Man we're introduced to the true hero Billy (Don Swayze) as he's getting it on in his trailer in the middle of the dessert. Once Swayze's satellite reception gets messed up by Digital Man he throws on his sleeveless plaid shirt and gets ready to rumble. Without fear Swayze teams up with the cyborgs to bring down this digital monster with a mere handgun and testicles the size of Leone's rice balls. Unfortunately Swayze takes one for the team and actually explodes from a rocket launcher shot by Digital man...yes you read that right...he explodes. In the end Larry is victorious in defeating the Ditital Man but without Swayze it really doesn't matter.

It was very clear Donnie was still on acting fire 3 years after his mind altering performance in the cult favored&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;providing us with nothing short of genius. Between the continued hilarious facial contortions and butchered script lines you will be in a state of glory soaking in one of films finest performances. On top of his usual perfection is the fact he took on the role of a remote desert hillbilly like nobody can, skyrocketing the film to a full fledged 5 star even. Without the presence of Swayze this one wouldn't have earned above a 1 star rating. So for those true Don Swayze enthusiasts we implore you to kick back and enjoy his finely tuned acting skills in Digital, however we may be the only true fans he's got.",1292889600,6,2598,4.849099099099099
700703,2,6303563031,"In this derivative scifi misfire, a digital man has been created, something of a terminator-type of machine/man.  He is indestructible and he has been secretly programmed to steal some codes to set off nuclear bombs.  The special team assigned to stop this digital man is led by Ken Olandt.  Ed Lauter and Paul Gleason are on hand as the bad guys and Adam Baldwin plays the inept captain.  Matthias Hues is the Digital Man, and he equals Schwarzenegger in his blandness.

Nothing new and unusual, except for a shotgun wielding old woman who becomes more annoying with each scene.

700922,4,6303563031,"In an era of movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Genisys/dp/B01013I9DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Genisys</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chappie/dp/B00UC9TLWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chappie</a>, can a B-grade robot adventure from the mid-90s find an appreciative audience? The answer is yes, at least if it can find its way into my hands. No low-budget filmmaker loved the sci-fi genre more than Philip J. Roth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-P-E-X/dp/B00004TITX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.P.E.X.</a>), and this particular cyborg-themed outing highlights the best that he  or almost anyone  could bring to the table under B-movie constraints. Though not terribly original, Digital Man is engaging and action-packed enough to accommodate its target audience and perhaps win over a few new fans as well.

The story: A squad of futuristic soldiers (led by Ken Olandt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Force/dp/6302888271/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Force</a>) is sent to a backwater Earth settlement to neutralize a deadly combat cyborg (Matthias Hues,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Angel/dp/B005HIBWUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Angel</a>) run amuck.

It bears emphasizing that viewers who need expensive production values and state-of-the-art special effects to enjoy sci-fi flicks will be disappointed by this one, with its outdated CGI and gooey prosthetics. Personally, I love the production design, which is so skillfully implemented that theres no stylistic discord even when the setting shifts from a high-tech space station to the dusty Earth setting. Despite a handful of esthetic lifts from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00MBNYT10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>, Digital Man looks and feels very much like its own movie, and in the process manages to avoid the artistic pitfalls of basing a production in the desert: its never not fun to look at, despite its limited color palette.

The actions comprised primarily of explosions and shootouts, with a smattering of kickboxing. Though bluntly effective, the firefights aren't worth the price of the picture alone, and its disappointing that Hues physical talents are limited to only a single, one-sided brawl. Despite looking cool in his armor, Matthias is generally the worst-utilized performer of the film, having next to no lines and virtually nothing to do other than stalking and shooting. The rest of the cast does much better, with especially the soldiers getting enough character moments so as to not feel expendable. The rest of the cast is pretty memorable, too: Don Swayze (brother of Patrick) is a decent supporting goof, Amanda Wyss does what she can in an uncredited role, and the great Susan Tyrell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fat-City/dp/B0074JOWBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fat City</a>) has two glorious cameo scenes.

Director Roth infuses the picture with the enthusiastic pacing and gusto so often missing from low-budget productions, thereby keeping the film upbeat and rolling along nicely. He might have also included a tad too much story for his own good, as the paranoia angle of squad members potentially being cyborgs themselves feels unnecessary for a movie this small. Nevertheless, the film is worth a rental, and potentially even a purchase if you still own a VCR.",1453939200,2,3804,7.117521367521367

bad that it keeps getting in the way. The general deserves special mention, followed by the annoying old lady with a gun. Without
those two, the acting would have just been very bad ... but these two make it annoyingly bad.

at them. Oddly, when they shoot at each other, nobody aims at the exposed heads. They shoot at each other's armor, only. Uh?",1420329600,,747,4.5

Also, would it have killed someone on this movie to have had any kind of military advisor on it?  The only thing the movie got right was the rank structure, otherwise, none of the military behavior or tactics made sense.

Cast - stay for the intro of Don Swayze and Chase Masterson then turn it off.
