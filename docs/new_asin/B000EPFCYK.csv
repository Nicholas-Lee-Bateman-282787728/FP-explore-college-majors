2526827,5,B000EPFCYK,Such an interesting look into how the Rivers family (Joan and Melissa) dealt with the death of Edger. I think it was extremely brave of the women to star in a movie about themselves in such a tryingly hard time in their lives.,1350518400,7,226,4.27906976744186
2526828,5,B000EPFCYK,"In 1987 Joan Rivers life as she knew it came crashing down on her. Her career stalled after being fired from the FOX network due to the failure of her late-night talk show, Johnny Carson turned his back on her, she started having financial problems, and her husband committed suicide blaming himself for the mess of his wife's career.

 In 1994 NBC aired this film, originally titled ""The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story"" that depicted the heartbreak that occurred in Joan and her daughter's life. Both played themselves in the telefilm and Joan would remark years later that it was very cathartic for both of them as they were able to rid themselves of the anger against Joan's husband for leaving them in such a dreadful way.

 The movie really delves into the problem of family suicide, what it does to the survivors, and how those survivors can heal and go on with their own lives.

 Anyone interested in this film should also purchase Joan's second autobiography entitled ""Still Talking"" where she writes about her husband's suicide. That book would be the basis for this film.",1307923200,9,1080,4.779569892473118
2526829,5,B000EPFCYK,"The fact that this movie was made is shock enough...that it's available on DVD is just too much.  This is a must see for fans of camp, or just train wrecks in general.  Two thumbs up in the worst possible way",1202428800,5,208,4.048780487804878

8112591,1,B000EPFCYK,I paid a lot of money for this movie and was very disappointed by it. I thought it was going to be a pretty good movie but it wasn't. Joan and Melissa Rivers acting was very bad and all they kept talking about was Edgar this and Edgar that. Big waste of money and time.,1417132800,,269,3.909090909090909

8112593,5,B000EPFCYK,"I find it fascinating that Joan and Melissa recreate their past life, not with actresses as per usual but playing themselves.  I couldn't call this movie perfect but the flaws are not large enough to give an overall top rating.  It's so bittersweet now because I learned that through this movie and Joan said this in her amazing documentary they actually healed their relationship.  It's sad to think now that her mother is not with her and I feel badly for Melissa and for the entire world on losing Joan Rivers, a legend and more importantly still a warm and relentlessly driven human being who brought so much laughter to the world and did so many personal things to help so many as was brought out after her death because she never bragged about anything she did to help others and this is why some saw a hard front but inside, very soft and sometimes lonely woman.  I will easily recommend this movie; it's moving.",1410825600,2,919,4.551515151515152
8112594,4,B000EPFCYK,"This isn't for everybody, but I consider myself to be a TV-Movie junkie and this sort of stuff is my feast.  I just adore it and watch it over and over again.  It's cheesy, campy and overdone but I love it.",1356393600,4,206,4.0
