1366142,5,B00004WMP2,"The weirdness of this 1977 television show defies description. It
lasted less than ten episodes, and no wonder it has been forgotten by
fans and viewers, and conveniently left off of the resumes of all
those involved in making the program.
The well-loved Brady Bunch
gathers together for another Brady show, the first after the original
was cancelled. Unfortunately, this one was created by Sid & Marty
Krofft of Saturday morning Super Seven fame. '70s disco-spangled
weirdness is at full power!
The Brady kids (especially Greg),
wanted to get into music, like the Partridges. They put out several
albums (some have been re-issued on CD), so naturally the producers
felt this would be a hit show with a built-in audience.
All of the
original cast but Jan signed on, leading to the Brady conundrum of
what has become known as the ""Fake Jan"" character, a
replacement Brady!
Of all the Brady cast, only Greg & Carol can
actually sing. Marsha and the Fake Jan can manage.
The show
appeared at the peak of television musical variety shows in the
'70s. Donny & Marie, Sonny & Cher, Captain & Tennille,
Tony Orlando & Dawn, The Osmond Family, and others were part of a
genre of television that has largely been forgotten. Every week would
bring a new guest star and/or singing act. Only ""Saturday Night
Live"" survives the variety show era and is still in production
today.
The Brady show boasted two innovations, the Rockette wannabes
known as the ""Krofftette Dancers & Water Follies"", and a
set that featured a large swimming pool for the underwater ballet
swimmers. Both are just weird when juxtaposed with the Bradys!
On
the DVD, two shows are featured, with guest stars Ann B. Davis
(Alice), Tony Randall, Rip Taylor, Vincent Price, Donny & Marie
Osmond, and H.R. Puffnstuff. Randall & Price steal their scenes,
and Davis is the most comfortable with the bad scripts. There is also
a short interview with Bobby & Cindy talking about what it was
like growing up as a Brady, working on the Variety Hour, and other
things about their careers.
Although the show has terrible writing,
is horribly dated, and emits 1970's toxically radioactive happiness in
its purest form, the Bradys are still the Bradys, and this is one
television enigma that is not to be missed. The DVD is reasonably
priced, too.",974160000,68,2292,4.819796954314721
1366143,5,B00004WMP2,I got this few years ago not a great show and it did not last long but you have to be a Brady fan to get this.,1394323200,,110,3.111111111111111
1366144,5,B00004WMP2,"I love this show--it is so unbelievably bad it's good! And the songs they sing take me back to my childhood in the 1970s. There were also some great guest stars like Tina Turner, Vincent Price, Charro, etc. To get through this day-glo glittery confection, you have to disconnect yourself from the original show and view the actors as themselves rather than as The Brady Bunch. Then it works, at least for me. This show is so alien from the happenings at 4222 Clinton Avenue that I really don't see this as a sequel or even related to the original show. It's just too bizarre a concept, which is probably why TV Guide rated it as the #4 worse show ever. Whenever I view it, I see Florence, Robert, Barry, Maureen, Susan, etc. and not their Brady characters. When they do a sketch of the Brady Bunch in their new ""home"", I see them re-enacting a Brady scene, but it still doesn't feel like the original show because of the different setting. Had they used the original Brady Bunch set for those portions, that might have helped to make more of a connection between the two shows.

The show was produced by Sid and Marty Kroft, who produced ""The Donny and Marie Show."" That show works because Donny and Marie were experienced entertainers/singers, whereas the Brady Bunch (save for Florence Henderson), were not.  Donny and Marie did not have a beloved sit-com in syndication prior to their variety show, so there was no previous image of them to compete with their variety show, as opposed to The Brady Bunch. Donny and Marie on a variety show makes sense; The Brady Bunch on one does not.

Perhaps my disconnect is helped by the fact that I only watched The Brady Bunch for the first three seasons, so the people I see on the Variety Hour do not look like the little kids I remember. They have matured considerably. Even Florence looks different with her Dorothy Hamill Wedge Haircut as opposed to her infamous Carol Brady Shag. ""Fake Jan"" Geri Reischl alters the dynamic dramatically with her presence. ""Fake Jan"" can out-sing and out-dance Maureen (Marcia), something that the original Jan wouldn't have done; she was supposed to be the middle child stuck in Marcia's shadow.

Given their limitations, the actors did a decent job with this show. I loved the Kroffettes, but their presence adds to the befuddlement of the audience. But they really add to the cheese factor of this show, making it genuine kitsch.

Again, view this show as a 1970s variety hour starring the ACTORS of The Brady Bunch, then mabe it will begin to make more sense!",1373760000,,2543,4.642222222222222
1366145,4,B00004WMP2,"America can't seem to get enough of the Bradys.  We've had them in many incarnations:  Original Bradys, Brady Brides, Brady Christmases and so on.  But for one glorious moment in time; for nine episodes in 1976/1977, we had disco Bradys.  Once in a while a show comes along that boggles the mind, and entertains you in a way that you won't admit out in public.  The Brady Bunch Variety Hour is one such show.  One part wholesome Brady, one part disco and one part ""comedy"" skits that will make you laugh only if you're very, very drunk.

This DVD, which has excellent picture and sound quality, features two of the hour-long episodes.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why they haven't released the other seven.  This is time capsule worthy if we want to confuse future generations.  Bedecked in bright orange and hot pink clothes, the Bradys dance, sing, attempt a little comedy...very little comedy (the scripts are ridiculously bad) and make 70s references about ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" and `up your nose' kind of humor.  Add in the Water Follies girls diving into a large pool and swimming around like they are a poor man's Esther Williams, and you have a recipe for the kind of 70s weirdness that makes for a good time.

Guest stars in episode one are Tony Randall and Donny & Marie Osmond.
Songs in the first episode include:
""Baby Face,"" ""One"" from ""A Chorus Line,"" ""Splish Splash,"" ""Memories,"" ""Attitude Dancing,"" ""Heaven,"" ""Dance with Me,"" ""I Could Have Danced All Night,"" ""The Hustle"" and the most watered down version of ""Shake Your Booty"" that you'll ever hear.  Kudos to Ann B. Davis who gets out there and shakes hers better than the young ones.

Guest stars in episode two are:  Vincent Price, Rip Taylor & HR Pufnstuf
Songs in the second episode include:
""Keep Your Sunny Side Up,"" ""It's Not Where You Start,"" ""All By Myself,"" performed by Barry Williams & Florence Henderson ""Time in a Bottle"" performed by Maureen McCormick, ""I Want to Be Happy,"" ""You've Made Me So Very Happy,"" ""Make Someone Happy,"" ""Put On A Happy Face,"" ""Happy Days,"" ""United We Stand.""

Florence Henderson can sing, but her voice is better suited for Broadway than K.C. and the Sunshine Band.  Geri Reischl (Fake Jan...Eve Plumb was a no-show for this outing), Barry Williams and Maureen McCormick have decent voices, too.

""Comedy"" skits include:  Brady problems, like Bobby thinking their father's musical skills ""stink"" too much to play their father in the variety show.  And my personal favorite - Greg wants to move out of the house, and the whole family has a complete come apart.  ""Carol"" acts like she's going to have a nervous breakdown.  Since he was about 23 at the time, this makes it even more hilariously absurd.

There's also a DVD extra - an interview with Susan Olsen (Cindy) and Mike Lookinland (Bobby), who says he remembers very little about this show...convenient memory or denial?  This DVD is crazy, odd and fun, all at once.  Let the Bradys take you to Funky Town...or their version of it.",1344297600,,3016,4.720841300191204
1366146,5,B00004WMP2,"I always had to watch what my brother wanted to watch; naturally, he had a TV in his bedroom and I didn't.  Mom sat and watched TV day and night on the family's main television, so it was always tense and grim and frankly, stupid and tyrannical.  When The Brady Bunch Variety Hour came out, I was desperate to watch it, but I was always vetoed.  Imagine my surprise, all these years later, to see two videos offered here on Amazon.  I bought those two volumes so fast and I was delighted to watch episodes I'd never seen.  Very light entertainment, suitable for children and entire families to watch.",1325635200,3,600,4.467889908256881
1366147,5,B00004WMP2,"The Brady Bunch Variety Hour was produced at the height of the outrageous '70s high-camp musical era. So perhaps it's no coincidence that this DVD is so bad and so over-the-top that it's both funny and very colorful. If you love the BB (and really who doesn't?) you will just love this DVD.

Florence Henderson and Robert Reed (may he rest in peace) each reprise their roles as Mrs. and Mrs. Mike Brady. Rounding out the cast are those super-cool Brady kids: Christopher Knight (Chris has always been my very favorite Brady because he is so sweet and sensitive), Barry Williams, Mike Lookinland, Maureen ""oh my nose"" McCormick, and Susan Olsen (who has a really groovy new feathered hairstyle). What I enjoy most about watching everyone together again is that it's like watching a group of familiar old friends.

Each ep is 50 minutes in total and as far as I can tell these are the full and unedited versions (I have no recollection of seeing this series on TV as it predates my birth by many years.) Included on this set are 2 eps from the variety series:

Volume 1 / episode #1 (original airdate: 11-28-76) - This is the first ep (after their special that aired a month earlier) and includes lots of groovy singing and dancing. Guest stars include Tony Randall and Donny and Marie.

Volume 2 / episode #4 (original airdate: 3-4-77) - Greg decides to move out of the Brady home and an entire ep, complete with corny singing and melodramatic acting compliments this ludicrous show. Vincent Price guest stars in this ep; don't worry though he isn't tying the boys to a giant tiki. Rip Taylor (you know it's going to be hoot with him) and the cast of H.R. Pufnstuf are also in this ep.

Alice (Ann B. Davis) is on both eps. She even sings a little too. I love the sequined pants suits she wears; it's so much cuter than the pale blue maid's uniform (which, incidentally she also wears, because after all, she's still Alice). For reasons that are unclear to me, Ms. Davis does not receive star billing; instead she is billed as a ""guest star.""

Noticeably absent from this BB reincarnation is Eve. I am not sure why Eve didn't participate in this; either she had something else going on or she didn't have a momentary lapse in good judgement like the rest. Geri Reischl aka ""fake Jan"" was, like all the others, excellent and offered up a beautiful singing voice, although she doesn't seem like she's as much of an overdone drama queen as Eve (who has always been one of my favorite Bradys, btw!!).

The Halston body suits, the loud print colors, the hip-huggers, the bell-bottoms, those super-super tight vests the men wore and all that glitter and rhinestones perhaps is one of the reasons why this series is so grounded in '70s culture. It's just so ridiculous and almost surreal to watch the Bradys singing and dancing all made up like the La Cage aux Folles dancers. It is just the end and I love it.

The DVD includes a brand-new (well 10 years old) interview with Susan and Mike. The interview is a full 20 minutes long. They discuss the original series, the Variety Hour and some of the other BB projects. As a fan that has followed the BB for my entire life this is truly one of the best interviews I have ever seen.

The DVD includes a colorful menu (taken from the series opening credits) which also plays music and even has chapter selections. There is also a colorful insert included. BTW I scanned everything just in case you'd like to see what it looks like.

Maybe you're down in the dumps and just need a little lift. The Bradys to the rescue! Because it's impossible to view The Brady Bunch Variety Hour without smiling and laughing. Who cares if it's dated and hokey and completely and totally out of touch with reality. Remember, every day can be a sunshine day if you work hard at it!!",1287878400,11,3803,4.530612244897959
1366148,2,B00004WMP2,"Let me say up front that I enjoy watching the regular Brady Bunch series. What kid who grew up during the Seventies wouldn't? But the Variety Hour is something entirely different. Instead of being cute and campy, it's dumb and and disturbing.

The fake Rockettes (Krofftettes?!) are one thing, but WTF with the swimming pool? Laugh tracks rarely ring true but why does this even pretend to have a studio audience? All very painful. Even worse and particularly nauseating are the goo-goo eyes the Brady boys make at their sisters during the roller skating number. (Greg lusting after his mom is nothing new, LOL)

This DVD doesn't even include all the Variety Hour episodes. Perhaps that's a blessing! Apparently there were nine episodes during the 1976-77 season. I would bet just two will be more than enough for you.

Unless being high improves the viewing experience, the interview with Susan Olsen and Mike Lookinland is the only thing worth watching. Kudos to Eve Plumb for taking a pass on this acid trip. (Keep an eye out for ""Fake Jan""!)",1266019200,2,1045,4.826815642458101
1366149,3,B00004WMP2,"When I ordered this, I did it for a number of reasons. First, my wife and I are big fans of 70s kitsch and the Brady shows are the epitome of it. We already own the 5 seasons of the original series, and were looking forward to a fresh dose of camp. We've both read Maureen McCormick's autobiography and it provided a lot of information regarding what was happening behind the scenes in the lives of the cast members.

Well, on the one hand we were deeply satisfied because the show exceeds all expectations in terms of trashy glitz, over-the-top acting, and ""what where they THINKING?"" moments. The show made Ed Wood's body of work look positively brilliant by comparison. As others have said, it's deliciously bad. The bonus interview really doesn't provide a lot of new information, but it was interesting to learn exactly what mistakes were made post-Brady that derailed most of the careers of the participants. Susan Olsen in particular knowingly discusses the irony in the fact that the last pooch that played ""Tiger"" on the Brady Bunch went on to have a more successful career than any of the humans on the show.

On the other hand...

The show lasted less than a season and, depending on the source, ran either 9 or 10 episodes. This collection only consists of two episodes. There is no reason given as to what happened with the remaining episodes and apparently there is no plan to release them to the public. Even the most addicted fans of campy trash would likely be unable to handle more than a couple of episodes in a single sitting, but it was quite a letdown to know that this set would only be a teaser and we'd be unable to acquire the remainder of the series.

Caveat Emptor - buyer beware. The two episodes provided are enough to sate your curiosity and interest in just how bad television can get, but we still wound up feeling we got less than half of what we wanted.

The old cliche says that half a loaf is better than none at all, but nonetheless, we thought we were paying for all the episodes, and not just enough to leave us wanting.",1257552000,27,2060,4.497326203208556
1366150,3,B00004WMP2,"Oh lord do I remember watcing this when it first came on. I was so excited that the Bradys were back together. But they weren't. We got Fake Jan instead of Real Jan! My oh my is this show bad. I still love it, though. What confuses me is why did Rhino release a box oset of all six episodes of Pink Lady & Jeff (which is even worse than this show) and only two episodes of the Brady Bunch Hour? I mean, come on. There were only eight episodes of this show so why not just release the entire series and be done with it?

Yes, this show is a bad as everyone has said it is. For this cheap of a price, treat yourself to a bit of TV weirdness and pick this up. The costumes alone are worth the price of admission.",1214179200,5,709,3.889655172413793
1366151,3,B00004WMP2,"The only episode of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour that I had ever seen, up until now, was the pilot episode, which I had seen several times. While I had heard how ""bad"" it was, and even mentioned as a nightmare, I thought it was hilarious. It was pretty far out there, even for the Bradys. However, I love it, mainly for that reason. The way that they all continue their Brady parts is wonderful, and the comedy they brought with it. However, I only gave this three stars, not because I didn't like it, but because I really hope all of the episodes are released on DVD. After all, if they're going to go through the trouble to release two, why not release all nine? One can only hope.

When watching these episodes, and hear them introduce themselves to you as the Brady Bunch, it's hard to think of them as anything other than the Brady Bunch and makes you really think that they are a real family.

Which makes me go back to that question we all ask ourselves. ""Why do we love the Bradys so much?"" And the answer is simple. Though they were one of the most unrealistic shows that there is, it's something that gives us all hope. When life is bad, we can escape to ""Bradyville"" where everything is always well.

For instance,  Robert Reed trying to channel old-skool Dick van in ""One Singular Sensation.""  By far, the creepiest is Greg and Carol singing ""All by Myself"" with their half portraits on the screen. There is just something SOOOO wrong having Greg singing about 'making love' to Carol.

The finales are awesomely bad and just hysterical. They demonstrate that Ann B. Davis is the only ""Brady"" with any real talent.

Florence Henderson and Barry Williams both have the goods to pull off a variety show, but the Brady Buck ends there, and unfortunately there are 6 more Brady's to deal with (though Maureen McCormick certainly can sing) not counting Alice.

If you're going to do a show featuring singing, you have to have great singers. The Brady Kids were duped into thinking they could make it as a music act, like the Osmonds or the Jackson 5, but they just didn't have the talent. Sometimes, in situations like that, a show gets lucky and produces a really great musical act from an actor's career. Ricky Nelson and David Cassidy are the two best examples.

But the Bradys couldn't sing. Then, on top of that, you have the over the top gay glamour of the Krofft brothers ... and well ... it's bad. Very, very, bad.

My kids just watched all the original episodes of The Brady Bunch, so I thought it might at least be funny to let them look at the Variety Show.

But the fact that they're supposed to be related occasionally seems to be overlooked.  Skits where the brothers are cruising the sisters, and Donny and Marie are playing boyfriend and girlfriend are two examples.

This is a great get together with friends dvd to watch, why tv guide included this in the top 50 worst is beyond me, its definitely not as bad as some people say. Greg wrecking on roller skates is incredibly funny to me for some reason, I'm glad they left that in, the look on the girls faces when he did that is priceless. Also, was there really an audience there? I don't remember them ever cutting to the audience and it sounds like a glorified laugh track to me, which just adds to the insaneness of it all. This is far more entertaining than all the mindnumbing reality based tv shows and glorified cop shows that are being crammed down our throats at the moment.

1366164,3,B00004WMP2,"Because their 1969-1974 series ultimately generated a comforting hokeyness in the turbulent 1960's, and the cultural climate was obviously not getting any mellower in the 1970's, a television power that be decided to bring the Bradys out of hibernation---and into this variety show.

Eve Plumb wisely had steered herself clear from this project, so there is a 'fake' Jan in the line up. Immediately telling of how bad this project really is, 'the family' is too busy embarrassing themselves to notice how different Jan looks.

Did the `square' Bradys only decide to do this show under the influence of powerful drugs----which would also make them forget what each other had actually looked like?
And, making things even worse, the fake Jan is only the immediately noticeable snafu in this abomination.

The Bradys are doing `numbers' which poorly fit with their previously well-established wholesome motif. Granted, they have to work with the hairstyles of the time...etc (and everybody WANTED their network to have at LEAST one variety show) but even with this perspective, the show reeked of VERY FOUL cheese.

Exacerbating the problem is the obvious appropriation of stars/characters who were `cool' (Donny Osmond seriously trying to pretend he is Henry Winkler playing ""Fonzie"" from `Happy Days') since the life of this quickly tired joke was not able to be prolonged on it's own merits.

Even in those disco-drenched days, the late 70's still produced family-friendly sitcoms. If Hollywood had really wanted to successfully capitalize on why the Bradys were a hit with the American public, they would have actually THOUGHT about keeping the series characters a little consistent to their earlier selves.

Realizing that a studio executive, writing/production team actually got approved and paid for this project is amazing. I am still tempted to believe series creators fudged details to studio executives (like the series's general bizarreness) in order to put it on the air. The sets...etc actually look like they had been designed during a bad acid trip and/or seizure.

Ironically, Robert Reed (who was infamous for his many on-the set disagreements in the earlier series) liked the variety hour only because it gave him the chance to gain experience performing in a `variety show' format. Yet, the genuine intra-cast camaraderie (including with the new Jan) alone was obviously not enough to save this blatant mistake. If there is a museum of atrocious television, this series MUST become a main exhibit.

I shudder to think what will happen to civilization if history repeats itself and allows a show like this to get on the air. Once was one time too many.",1104019200,6,2668,5.159722222222222

Watching ""Greg"" trying to sing a Broadway number is painful; watching Mike dance to ""shake your booty"" is agonizing, making the Silver Platters routine look like a Bob Fosse number.  The jokes are hopeless; watch as one the confused Water Follies kicks in the opposite direction at the end of the show.  Tony Randall is boring, the fake Jan is, well, as fake as that famous black wig.  The roller rink sketch that places real life brother/sister Donny and Marie Osmond (themselves cheesy variety show royalty) and fake brother/sister Greg and Marcia singing ""Splish Splash"" is the singlemost vapid and devastating piece of television ever created.  Watch this after the party is over and you're very drunk.",1056153600,6,1119,4.683673469387755

LMAO, in fact, on 1 of my cassete shows I do, i used the song from V2, to show how I was all allone. It was the song Greg and Carol did, the duett All By Myself/Tace's Of Love. Iwish they could get the piolet on tpe, I liked, as a kid, when they did CAR WASH! However, I remember Carol doing it, but I found out it was Alice! LOL!",1043193600,2,406,3.5730337078651684
1366168,3,B00004WMP2,"To be honest, I as expecting something far worse and was actually delighted with the 80's charm and Brady charisma.  The fact of the matter is, individually, perhaps some did not have the talent to pull off a variety show - but as a ""Bunch"", it was endearing !  I was a Brady Bunch fan during their tenure when it first aired and -- kinda like Bobby (Mike Lookinland), remember nothing about this show and pretty sure I never watched it when it originally aired.  I also preferred the Partridge Family to the Brady's, but generally enjoyed them both and am enjoying my retrospective of those years.

Yes - I know, TV Guide says this show was one of the 50 Worst ever... But they are dead wrong and I can prove it:  Bosom Buddies is not in the 50 Worst List !

So, get thinking 80's here Folks:  Remember too:  The Carpenters had a number of Variety Shows  - and no one disputes Karen and Richard were one of the most talented duos of the last decade:  But even their variety show was of the same ilk --- and not much better ! (sans Karen's Gorgeous and Rich voice register that could melt me like butter...).

I think this also proves that while Robert Reed had his demons, he genuine loved this brood and stayed with them until the end...",1030665600,,1239,4.32034632034632
1366169,5,B00004WMP2,"I bought this DVD on a whim and was I delighted.  Where else can you see Carol Brady singing from a ""Chorus Line"" or disco standards by the whole clan.  Even Alice makes an appearance!  The guest stars include Donny and Marie Osmond (with awful New Yawk accents to boot), Rip Taylor and H.R. Pufnstuff.  But the end all reason to buy this DVD is the extremely disturbing and odd number that Tony Randall does with dancing animals.  Truly a must have for Brady fans and fans of the wonderful world of 70's cheese.  Enjoy",1027555200,11,519,4.410526315789474
1366170,5,B00004WMP2,"After reading the reviews from other Amazon purchasers, I simply HAD to add this to my collection. I was 6 years old when the Brady Bunch TV show premiered and I remember watching these Variety Hours as a pre teen wondering what on earth?? I can truly say watching them as an ADULT was a million times better! This DVD is so ridiculous that it's HILARIOUS!! Robert Reed should have become a hot dog cart vendor before agreeing to be in this ridiculous Variety show! The way he is acting is nothing short of ludicrous. The skits are ridiculous, the colors are so mind-bending that you should turn the color down on your tv, and the acting is a zero on a scale from 1-10. Yet, because of all this, it is entertaining in a strange way. The whole time I was watching it, I was thinking WHAT ON EARTH??? There wasn't a single time that this show was normal or entertaining. Just plain LUDICROUS!! If you are a kid of the 60's/70's era of the Brady Bunch, you gotta get this!!!",1024963200,25,971,4.34065934065934
1366171,5,B00004WMP2,"The jokes, the songs, the dancing. The Brady Bunch is in their glory and all are at the high point of their careers. It's just a shame that Eve Plumb did not choose to particiapte...",1019433600,2,182,4.228571428571429
1366172,5,B00004WMP2,"Although the dialog is corny, the musicals are great. But again, the Brady Bunch is known for being corny and goody-goody. That is what I love about the Bunch. I especially love the singing and dancing by all the Brady's. Florence Henderson has such a beautiful singing voice. I really enjoyed it when she sang ""Traces of Love"" and ""All By Myself with Barry Williams. And I expecially love the ""Happy Songs"" medley as the show's finale.",1013040000,2,436,4.675324675324675
1366173,4,B00004WMP2,"This is a trip....I was smiling almost all the way through it!  The DVD is divided into three parts:  The interview with ""Bobby"" and ""Cindy"", which is fairly interesting (they talk about their remembrances of the variety show, even though Mike Lookinland seems to have blocked much of it out).  The other two parts are the first and second BBVH installments.  Guest stars include Tony Randall (what was HE thinking????), Vincent Price, Rip Taylor, H.R. Puffnstuff, and Donnie & Marie.

The first episode has a truly surreal ""number"" featuring a bunch of clowns jumping around in a swimming pool (some of the clowns being Bradys).  Very strange and incoherent!  This whole Variety Hour concept seems like something Ed Wood had a hand in!  The first episode is also notable because Jan is portrayed as a whining, complaining malcontent...which is surprising because the whole Jan-Brady-angst phenomena didn't really take shape until the last 10 years or so.",1002844800,20,955,5.076923076923077
1366174,5,B00004WMP2,"I was laughing so hard and happy to have this DVD. I know that the simpsons spoofed this and other variety shows of the time, and watching these again just made me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside. If you are into Brady Nostalgia r variety Show Nostalgia this is a good buy. However why they had thet large pool I will never know.",1001635200,,335,4.090909090909091
1366175,4,B00004WMP2,"Trust me when I say this: the show and therefore the DVD are brutal.  Awful.  A complete embarrassment.  And entertaining as all hell!  The show is an acid-trip mess of Brady whitebread smarminess and Krofft Brothers bizarre-ness that has to be seen to be believed.  Poor Robert Reed...as if he didn't hate playing Mike Brady enough, he was turned into a song-and-dance man for this show and he was anything but.  At one point, you actually see him stop dancing and laugh at himself because he was so far off his mark.  Another time, you actually see Greg wipe out on a roller rink and the editors completely miss it.  It's almost unwatchable, but for those who appreciate great cheese like I do, it's a goldmine!  I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since I saw Waiting For Guffman.",996796800,6,784,4.542857142857143
1366176,5,B00004WMP2,"When you are having a party, pop this into your DVD and just watch as the entire congregation of guests begins to transfix its gaze on the television.  If you want to know what the episodes are like, read the other reviews.  I just wanted to mention that not only are these 2 episodes hilariously campily silly, the audio and video quality are SUPERB.  Considering this was a crappy '70s show that has probably been laying around in a vault for twenty years, Rhino gave it very nice treatment when transferring it to DVD.  Very clean images, which make the 70s decor even more disturbing that one could imagine.  Also included on the DVD is an interview with Mike Lookinland (Bobby) and Susan Olsen (Cindy), who talk about their days doing the BB and the BBVH.  Not to be missed!!!!!!!!",982281600,9,786,4.578571428571428

Who would have thought the peppy, hip, bell bottom family would start doing variety? Well, anyway, it's SO GOOD! I love their preformance of Baby Face. It's pretty cool. And Attitude Dancing, The Hustle, and most weird of all, Shake your Booty?!?!?! This is a must watch for all Brady fans, but I will give you a warning: This could be dangerous to children under 3 years of age.",979084800,8,502,4.467391304347826
1366178,5,B00004WMP2,"When this DVD came, I ran over to my DVD player, put it in and sat, transfixed for an hour and a half. This HAS to be the best example of ""OMIGAWD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING??"" anywhere! Some highlights: (but not all of them!)
1) The CLOTHES they were wearing. 70's 70's 70's. Bellbottoms! Leisure suits! wide ties! Check out Greg's hilarious padded suit during the ""Attitude Dancing"" number.. and Greg's sexy chest hair since he insists on keeping the first 3 buttons of his shirt open. 2) The SONGS: I just LOVE how they managed to mix in Donna Summer's ""Love to Love you Baby"" in with their rendition of ""Baby Face"". Other highlight - 2 versions of ""The Hustle!"" 3) The 70's references: To show how HIP they really are references are constantly made about other 70's icons. Baretta, The Odd Couple, Led Zepplin, Happy Days (Always wanted to see Donny Osmond as the Fonz? Well now's your chance) and, most especially, Welcome Back Kotter (watch Tony Randall's sharp delivery on ""Up your nose with a rubber hose"") are all mentioned. 4) The INEPTNESS of it all! Consistently filled with goofs, you wonder where the editors were that day. (Watch Greg wipe out during the rollerskating number, yet everything continues as if nothing happens) The water ballet stuff is rather strange too. Who asked for THAT?
An essential DVD to have for anyone remotedly interested in the 70's. :)

Although i must remember firstly that this was made back in the later 1970's/early 80's maybe?,it was however interesting though to see what the brady bunch looked like say!....several years down the road from when their last season finished which i think was back in 1974.

Yes i am still a big fan of the braddy bunch,and have been a fan ever since they started to show the entire series on our screens here in new zealand.,i have the whole series from season 1 through to season 5 which i so love to watch as much as i can.

All-in-all yeah! i reckon you might like watching this dvd here of the brady bunch variety hour,all the original cast appear on this dvd incl alice.",1397088000,,918,4.420118343195266
