8279256,5,B001ARDC02,"Although it is not available, I saw it on TV and it is an excellent movie.  When it becomes available to purchase, this is definitely a film that you should add to your collection.",1454889600,5,180,4.294117647058823
8279257,5,B001ARDC02,"OMG!!  This movie, in my opinion was excellent!!  It really does make you think about how you are effected by people throughout your life.  The ending? You would have to be an excellent writer to come up with that ending.  After the movie was over... I sat there reading the credits.  I was curious about whom else had a hand in this production!  Fantastic work!!",1452556800,2,363,4.507692307692308
8279258,1,B001ARDC02,Terrible acting and the male lead acted like a teenage girl. He was a complete wus of a man and I was very frustrated that he wasn't killed in the first 20 minutes.,1321660800,,164,4.0
8279259,2,B001ARDC02,"WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers. I thawt this might be good it really isn't. I have seen worse but this flick is not worth watching in my opinion, there just isn't much to it,a pathetic lonely man buys whores, finds one he likes (a serial killing cannibal, zombie that kills and eats her johns) and she likes him. They fall in love, she quits the business and they get married, he helps kill and get feed for her. A madman whose brother was one of her victims searches NYC for her leaving a bloody trail in his wake, the rest is history. Fairly well made for a low budget indie film but most of the scenes are short and shallow. I'd give it 2 Stars, Fair movie",1283990400,,667,4.25984251968504
8279260,3,B001ARDC02,"A mysterious prostitute who cannibalizes her customers while they are alive, agrees to marry a lonely man who reluctantly supports her lifestyle. Though SKINNED ALIVE is billed as a Horror film, it has at least one foot firmly planted in the Soft Porn genre. Gore Hounds will take to the helping of gore dished out, which is amply displayed even as the opening credits role with a ""John"" who gets his face partially ripped off by our villain. There is even an evisceration, with the aftermath displayed in all of it's gory glory, (a better shot of this is revealed in the Special Features section of the DVD-check it out). This indie effort has much going for it and I was pleased to see nasty looking facial appliances as well as some convincing gore and properly colored blood. Shots of the vixen chomping merrily on shredded latex always looks more credible then bad CGI. The level of acting was also competent and perhaps a notch or two above that which we are usually accustomed to seeing in this fare, (though still not on par with an A list film). Curiously, it was never explained why her victims permitted themselves to be mutilated as they could have fought back, (with the exception of her colleague who was handcuffed and ball-gagged). Further, that it was never explained who OR what she was. Indeed, the film flirted with the suggestion that it was all in her boyfriend's head while he was doing the killing. Such, however, is not the case and whatever she was, she was REAL. Our vixen was obviously a Ghoul or an intelligent, new breed of Zombie who is immune from head shots, (hence my review as I love ""Z"" flicks). In my opinion she was a GHOUL. Though definitely NOT a date movie, SKINNED ALIVE is a decent, dark and disturbing outing with an interesting plot that should entertain fans of hard core Horror. With a little more polish, less talk (and more action), this could easily have peaked out close to 4 stars or more. Recommended.",1281398400,3,1954,4.617816091954023

8279262,3,B001ARDC02,"Skinned Alive (James Tucker, 2008)

First off, take note: this movie, released on DVD under the title Skinned Alive, was originally released under the title Eat Your Heart Out. Don't see it twice if you don't mean to! But, that said, I'm not entirely sure you should even see it once, though I did like it better than the average IMDB user (as I write this, its average rating is 3.7).

Plot (which should sound familiar from a few different flicks): Pandora (Melissa Bacelar, recruited into the Troma stable right out of college for Toxic Avenger IV) is call girl with a difference: after you get what you paid for, you get what you didn't when she kills and eats you. All is going--relatively--well for Pandora until she meets the reserved Jeffrey (Jack Dillon, in his first screen appearance), who falls in love with her at first sight. She finds herself returning his feelings, but has to figure out how to hide her diet from him, or how to break it to him gently. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to either Pandora or Jeffrey, a mysterious man (Aunt Rose's Joshua Nelson, who also wrote the script) is trying to track down Pandora, and given his methods, it's pretty obvious he's not looking to deliver a bouquet of flowers.

Despite knowing better, I always hope, when I see a no-budget horror flick, that I'm going to get something original. The very few times it happens keeps me coming back for more. Skinned Alive, unfortunately, doesn't have an original thought in its head, but there's the occasional derivative movie that's kind of fun. From this perspective, the movie delivers, and not just because Melissa Bacelar would be worth staring at for an hour and a half even if she were just sitting still. Despite your probably not recognizing the names here, this is one of the very few no-budget horror flicks of recent years where the majority of the cast has at least some experience in front of the camera, and it does show. After horror movie after horror movie of characters who seem like they should be in the psychiatrist's office for flat affect, here we have some characters who know how to emote without (usually, anyway) going over the top. And some thought obviously went into the casting of Jeffrey, as well; Dillon, despite being a first-timer, comes across with the difficult mix of shyness and affability that the character calls for.

Not deathless cinema, of course, but certainly watchable. Better, in fact, than about half the horror movies I've seen so far this year (and there have been many of them). ***",1243814400,3,2529,4.740909090909091
