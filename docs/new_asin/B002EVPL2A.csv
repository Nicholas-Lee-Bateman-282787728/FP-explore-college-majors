8368324,5,B002EVPL2A,"I saw this on TV in 2009. I miss the first 30 min and sorry that I did. I admit I thought it was going to be a fluff piece. I had lost a sister to cancer so I knew all of the horrors and the griefs that one goes thru, But the I forget the name of the lady the did the camera work. She did a wonderful job and I understand at one point she wanted to put the camera done, but Farrah told her not to and said ""this is what cancer is,"" She was  a brave women to let the world see how the cancer was hurting her.
Not all of us have the money to go to Germany for treatment, but I for one am glad she could as it helped prolong her life. The cameras didn't close in on how she looked her last few days and I think that was best. Noone really needs to see how bad the body is ravaged by this decease unless you are a close family member - it will haunt you forever.

On the bright side, I never knew she was a artist! And a damn good one. I wish is her father is still alive he could show her work so the world would how truly talented she was in other areas since people didn't give her credit most of the time for her acting.

So why is it taking so long for this to come out on DVD? It has been over 3 years now???",1359763200,,1210,3.646153846153846
8368325,5,B002EVPL2A,"its a great documrntary.one of the best ever made. now it has disappeared and many cancer sufferers need her strength and truth, it is wrong to take it off the air over squabbling over right, put it back on and air an update if necessary",1304985600,5,237,4.288888888888889
8368326,4,B002EVPL2A,"Like Brad, whose review is also listed here, I re-watched this moving documentary just recently, June 25th, the 1st Anniversary of Ms. Fawcett's tragic passing.  During my first viewing the biggest impression I walked away with was how brave this woman was, how strong, how fearless.  I have always adored Farrah, but after watching this documentary I was inspired by her as well.  On my second viewing this year, what stood out to me was the fact that every time her prognosis was more dismal, it was Farrah who held out her arms and embraced those around her, including her many doctors, to comfort them.  That is true testament to what a sweet, caring person she was.  The fact that Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith rallied around Farrah during her fight is yet another testament to a genuine, enduring friendship that lasted for more than 30 years.  Rest in peace sweet Farrah.",1278201600,5,878,4.743421052631579
8368327,5,B002EVPL2A,"I watched this program again a year to the day after it first aired on NBC, May 15, and was again moved to tears several times. At one point in the documentary Farrah, while crying, wonders aloud if God will let her reach down with her wing to touch the rain, if only for a moment. If anything, the loss her passing represents is even more obvious today. It has been said that Carole Lombard's death is the damndest shame in Hollywood history. Losing the light that was Farrah casts an equally large and sad shadow.",1258502400,3,515,4.375
8368328,5,B002EVPL2A,"I liked this documentary enormously. I am a cancer patient. Just watching Farrah go through the PET scans and then sit there watching her ""colorful"" results (the worst results are pretty and colorful) was worth watching alone. I certainly never got this view of the process prior to being caught up in it myself. If you are not a cancer patient, her process is the way it is and it is life altering even if you survive. For one, survivors continue with all of these scans and the stress of waiting for the results (the stress is unbelievable and cumulative).

I must say though I was surprised by two things. First, she refused the colostomy surgery and, second, she put off the most severe chemotherapy till last because of her hair. My oncologist said that the minute you find out you have cancer, you hit it THEN with the most powerful weapons you've got. You do not use the least severe forms of treatment first and work your way up to the most severe forms. Yet this is what Farrah seems to have done. I frankly was not impressed with any of her doctors and think far more of my own at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. I got colon cancer in 2006 and am still alive. I took the most severe chemotherapy course even though it was considered optional for my 2A diagnosis (following my oncologist's ""hit it with everything now"" advice). After watching this documentary I am glad I did not rush off to Germany for ""treatments"" which are still unproven instead.

As for Ryan O'Neal and Alana Stewart, IF they were using Farrah to push themselves forward in the Hollywood world, then that is a very stark statement about why you are better off being an older person with cancer and ordinary friends and family.  I would believe this mendacity and egotism more of O'Neal than of Stewart as his character has always been an open issue.  No one could profit from my cancer, thank God.

This is Farrah's story and her aid to cancer patients who follow her and I think they will all be helped by it.

8368329,5,B002EVPL2A,"I have a younger sister who was diagnoised w/breast cancer. She underwent the double mastectomy surgery. However, she is scared to death of the radiation therapy reguired to keep her cancer free and has cancelled the kemo 3 times. I wish she had the courage like Farrah did to fight the fight. Farrah has been an inspiration to millions of people. Please let her continue to inspire more including my baby sister.",1251244800,4,413,4.75
