4836045,4,B005MR4P5W,"I have watched this dvd at least 8 times. That's a lot for someone who views a dvd once, I got it, I got it. But, I DO LOVE Vivica Fox.

This play was so entertaining and funny. I had to watch it again and again. It was great seeing Ms. White perform, I did miss her. And, Brian McKnight sang is butt off!

Four stars because they need to throw in some gay & lesbian relationships from time to time. We go through stuff too. Don't we exist?

Again, quite entertaining.",1325980800,,468,4.065217391304348
4836046,4,B005MR4P5W,"Although there are three couples the play is basicly about Viveca Fox and Brian McKnight's characters. Although they've been married for 10 years, the husband, who is a doctor, still doesn't really knows his wifes wants and dreams; except that she wants a family and he doesn't. She's devoted all of her energy into putting his wants and needs first; which include finally opening up his own private family practice. One day, he comes home and tells her some news that rocks her to the core. With the constant instigating by their friends, we watch as the men and women battle it out for dominance. The play is very entertaining and filled with the music of Brian McKnight. Watch this play to see why men have said for years and Johnnie Taylor made a song to tell men that, ""It's Cheaper To Keep Her.""",1324598400,2,801,4.569444444444445
4836047,4,B005MR4P5W,"This is a good play to enjoy with your mate and/or family & friends. The plot was okay but needs a little more tweeking. However, he had an excellent cast line-up. They kept you laughing. The music was wonderful especially if you're a Brian McKnight fan. I would say this director is an up and coming star and I look forward to seeing more of his work in the near future. I recommend this movie for everyone.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Je-Caryous-Johnson-s-Cheaper-To-Keep-Her/dp/B005MR4P5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Je'Caryous Johnson's Cheaper To Keep Her</a>",1324512000,4,610,6.188235294117647
4836048,1,B005MR4P5W,This was horrible. I rented it and for what! It was horrible. I watched the first 30mins without even one laugh. I then looked at my wife who fell asleep. Needless to say it was horrible.  Its in the comedy section without any comedy in it.,1324252800,,240,4.217391304347826

4836051,5,B005MR4P5W,"I watched this play with some apprehension. After seeing one too many bad plays, I was worried that this would be another sterotypical, poorly written play full of non-acting. Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong! I loved this play from beginning to end. Not only was it hilarious, but there was a strong message that left me feeling like this was money well spent. I am headed to check out other JeCaryous Johnson plays! I hope they're all like this!",1323734400,5,451,4.580246913580247

4836157,4,B005MR4P5W,"This was a play and not a movie, so for a play i thought is was good. Had a nice mix of themes, comedy was done well and not over done, acting was fine. I enjoyed the acting of Ms Fox she helped keep the play together and i also liked Brian McKinghts singing the dvd is worth that alone. If you are a fan of plays this one should be in your collection.",1343088000,,352,3.77027027027027
4836158,5,B005MR4P5W,"This was so awesome, funny, exciting, twist and turns... I did not want this to end... This was on point and needs to be discussed more in the African American culture... so many times many look for greener grass instead of caring for what they already have, instead of studying what they already have and making that work.. Many times many people think that they can just start over and every thing will be utopia.. no such thing... but it does make since to keep what you have and work on that..

I loved the subject matter, the ending, all the characters did a marvelous job! The story line is reality and on time! Please make more plays like this, because too many times we do not take care of our marriages or home. We neglect them and then turn and want to walk away and say its been this way for a long time...

Time to wake up and get right! You will learn so many lessons from this and you will walk away refreshed! You will want more and you will be blessed! Don't miss out on this awesome play! The singing is great, the acting is great! add this to your collection!

And remember it is cheaper to take care of your marriage now... Don't let your family, friends, career take over your marriage. Remember the one who has been there for you through it all.

******Update!****12/28/2012*************still watching and still love this!**

4836161,4,B005MR4P5W,"From my perspective, I saw a troubled marriage riddled with repeat arguments over the same subject, lack of agreement with goals and values and distractions from the issues of their marriage. I saw a couple who lost their way together and regret the choices made that gave rise to it crumbling.  A love story about restoration combined with perfect comedic timing; I so needed to laugh and this play provided plenty of opportunities. The balance of dialogue and music worked for me, there was an actual storyline that was presented nicely and accompanied by music that wasn't overpowering or too much. My only reservations pertain to the editing of the play, it was obvious that the battle between the boys was cut short, I wish the battle had played out in its entirety. For this reason I wish I had seen the play live. Overall, Cheaper to Keeper was simply entertaining and enjoyable.",1333497600,3,886,4.790849673202614
