7819558,4,6302010438,"Watching this movie shows up many of the problems still existing today for the Oglala Indians (and most likely many others). That problems originally created by the US govt still exist today, does NOT reflect well on our ""civilized"" society! The very least the US govt could do, is to protect sacred Indian sites!

Unless the US govt establishes Bureaus for African American Affairs, Hispanic American Affairs and others - wouldn't it be time to dissolve the Bureau of Indian Affairs? Should the Bureau of Indian Affairs even have been created in the first place? It seems, that it has created nothing but problems during it's entire history. Makes me ashamed to be white!",1377561600,,672,4.894736842105263
