8513850,5,B005Y2X90W,I love this concert video. It's my second favourite from Namie - the other being Queen of Hip Pop. The energy level is more consistently up on this one than on her last few where she seemed a bit tired at times. This one is hard-hittingly hip. Not great for the ballad lovers I suppose - only a couple in the middle and one at the end. But if you like seeing her dance moves - I do! - this one is for you!,1330992000,,405,3.8333333333333335
