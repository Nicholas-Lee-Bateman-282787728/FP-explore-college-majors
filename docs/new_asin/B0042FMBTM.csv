4250413,5,B0042FMBTM,"A lot of people have a lot of hate for this season, especially the episode ""Who Can?"" but I think this season was one of the most brilliant seasons of all of Kenny vs Spenny.  The comedy is outrageous and hilarious and the show is as good as ever.  None of them may be my favorite episode of all time, but all of them are brilliant in their own way.  Whether Kenny trying to hook up with Spenny's mom, the greatest Cock Fight of all time, or Spenny finally cheating to win, this season is well worth it.",1285545600,,503,4.112244897959184
4250414,4,B0042FMBTM,"I caught most of the episodes on Showcase as they aired and except for a few weak episodes the overall season was a blast.  Some scenes are a little more rehearsed and polished but when it comes down to it you can't fake the lunacy when these two are at their best.

The episode that was never aired - Who is the Biggest Idiot - is one of the highlights is and totally makes Season 6 worth it.  The outakes were really good as well.

I gave this one four stars because it just didn't top Season 4 which I think was their best season.  Season 6 is well worth it for any KvsS fan and also a good entry point for those who have just discovered them.

Season 6 - Good Thinkin Mama!",1283904000,2,677,4.014925373134329

8413616,1,B0042FMBTM,cant review season 6 because they sent me season 2 instead contacted them on this issue and to this day not even an apology or offer to fix error.,1350000000,,146,4.068965517241379
8413617,1,B0042FMBTM,"They have mistakenly UPC'd season 2 as season 6. I thought this was just an anomaly (I had ordered s1-6 here) when I received two copies of season 2. So instead of going through the hassle of a return I just bought another copy. Just received it and it is another season 2 dvd.

Hopefully they fix this soon since there are not too many sales channels with KvS.",1341014400,3,361,4.231884057971015
8413618,4,B0042FMBTM,"Kenny vs Spenny is one of those shows that people either love or hate, if they even know what it is.  I'm easily entertained and have a sick sense of humor and I've loved the show since the first time I saw it on YouTube.  You can tell in this season that the cast and crew were definitely running out of show ideas, but they pull it together pretty well.  The episodes themselves are a mixed bag, and Spenny is sometimes embarrassing to watch (I grimaced at times because he has become so awkward).  Ultimately it deserves a purchase from fans.  I only wish they had included the ""Christmas Special"" (the actual final episode of the series).",1339200000,,642,4.452991452991453
8413619,3,B0042FMBTM,"For me, the earlier seasons are the best, but true KVS fans will want to add this to their collection.",1305676800,,102,4.15
8413620,4,B0042FMBTM,"Kenny and Spenny are awesome like usual, still not as good as the first couple seasons though. Still has some cannot miss scenes like usual. Canadian masters of comedy, why cant somebody pay me to do that for a living???",1299715200,,220,4.525
