7995127,5,B0000A0WH8,"One warning right away. DO NOT see ""Happy New Year,"" the terrible American re-make of this film in which Peter Falk plays Lino Ventura's role. See this one-the original. ""La Bonne Annee"" is about a jewelry heist and has some great acting and great pre-CGI stunt driving as well. My favorite line from the film occurs at an awkward dinner party filled with sexual tension in which the aging leading man, just recently out of prison, counters some ""sophisticated"" young pup who is trying to impress their mutual love interest by grilling Ventura on his taste in film by saying "" I choose my films like I choose my women. I take chances."" Lelouch is the master of this genre of film and my favorite French director.",1375660800,,712,4.6141732283464565
7995128,4,B0000A0WH8,"Whilst liking the remake with Peter Falk, this original is another terrific example of that wonderful era of Continental cinema that ran through the '50s to the early '80s.

Lino Ventura as always is a great crook-subtle, engaging, hard when needed but with an inner vulnerability.

There are so many good scenes but my favourite is the ghastly dinner party where the heroine's friends belittle Ventura and his pal, prompting her to chuck out her ""friends"".

Ventura's passing at a relatively early age was a great loss when you think of what he might have achieved in older age like that other giant of French cinema-Trintignant.

Essential for anyone's Continental collection.",1340323200,,678,5.081081081081081
7995129,5,B0000A0WH8,"When this movie first came out in the 70s, I went to see it repeatedly. Then, when the VHS version came out, I was able to watch it every Christmas. It's the quintessential French existential movie; Ventura's character, Simon, says it all when he asserts to Francoise as she visits him in jail, ""But I am a nice guy!"" . (In French, ""un type bien"" means more than ""a nice guy"", but that'll do). What is perceived as criminal behavior (breaking into a jewelry store) is not a matter of ""crime"" so much as what a person chooses to do. He might as well have been an ice cream vendor. What counts is a man's honor and integrity. Again, Simon says it all: ""There are only two types of people in my world: those that I like, and those that I don't."" Legality and morality are not at stake here, but a man's honesty with himself. Again, Simon says it all: ""A woman is a man who cries a little; a man is someone who goes all the way."" What defines a man is his character.",1232236800,2,962,4.17741935483871
7995130,5,B0000A0WH8,This is not a classical predictable movie. It entertains all along and leaves suspense at the same time.,1162684800,,104,4.833333333333333
7995131,5,B0000A0WH8,"My wife Clare and I have been watching La Bonne Annee every New Year's Eve since the early 90's. What a thrill for us to be able to retire the VHS copy this year. The DVD transfer is much cleaner. It is true that the English sub-titles are not always an accurate translation of the French, but we find that true with all French Films.  FYI when you hear the French for ""comfortable"" in the film, you should know that it has a much more intimate sense than our English version.
La Bonne Annee really stands up to repeated viewings. It has many pleasures, It's wonderfully directed, filmed and edited. The acting is seamless (the lingering close-ups of Lino Ventura's face linger in the mind too) . It has wit, romance, friendship, is poignant, and has suspense too. You will never look at any price that ends with .99 the same way again.
We own very few DVD's. This one is a treasure.",1074729600,16,883,4.41717791411043
7995132,5,B0000A0WH8,"Claude Lelouch made this movie in 1973. He had made ""a Man and a Woman ""in 1965 and the haunting melody will be forever in our ears. He loved his work so ,that he could even joke about it ""you have to love windshield wipers"" He did a sequel in 1985""A Man and a Woman,2O years later"" which was surprisingly good.""La bonne anne""starts with a scene from this masterpiece and I love both movies . Although one could object to the ending-crime is not supposed to pay-Franoise Fabian is so beautiful and Lino Ventura so believable,that the ending seems well deserved. I am glad it is finally available on DVD and I only wish for French subtitles, the English ones only approximate the dialogue.",1060646400,5,688,4.556451612903226
