Would have liked to see more of Steven Bauer, but his performance was the most honest I've seen him in. All the actors were good. Loved how it kept me guessing till the surprising end.

8738839,5,B017E1OE8Q,"Hello all. I watched this movie two years ago and it was during the release of a free screening of the movie when it was coming out of production. The movie was great because of its story line. There was a lot of focus on the love of family and the ways in which we end up showing our real emotions for our family when mistakes come between us and change the course of our lives. It is a movie that truly affects the heart to feel the reality of one day losing a person you really love over anything left in the world.

The movie is worth having on your home movie shelf; pop it in once in a while with family and remember that each person you have in your life has a part of your heart unconditionally and forever.",1449964800,,715,4.035211267605634
