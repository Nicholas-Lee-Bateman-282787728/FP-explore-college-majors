8683840,5,B00OJ0X3YM,"My daughter's favorite version of Dora is when she is a mermaid so this DVD collection was right up her alley.  It features Dora as a mermaid as well as some other great water-related episodes.  You get a total of six episodes and two music videos jam packed into this set.  I will say they are episodes your child may have seen already on television but for us it was great to have them on hand in one set.  It is perfect for any Dora fan or mermaid fan!
