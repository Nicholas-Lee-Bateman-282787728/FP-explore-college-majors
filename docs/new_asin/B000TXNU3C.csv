8211334,1,B000TXNU3C,"""I am a Traveling Man and what this DVD put out was totaly wrong for people to assume they know or have knowledge about the Craft is dead wrong. This is why the world looks at my craft and think negative thoughts about the Gentlmen in the Craft.  I nor any one in my Lodge worships the devil so I say If you are a true traveler don't purchess or if you are seeking don't bother BAD INFO, BAD INFO, BAD INFO.""",1208476800,7,408,3.975609756097561
8211335,5,B000TXNU3C,"The large number of ex-Masons who testified made this a slam-dunk that it was accurate. I then showed my father-in-law who was a Mason but who had not attended meetings for a couple years. He looked very depressed after viewing it. I asked him if it was inaccurate and repied, ""no, I feel badly since it is likely true and I offended God."" He never attended another Lodge meeting.  I also acquired a Masonic Morals and Dogma book and sure enough, the quotes in the video are accurate. Anyone in this pseudo-religious organization really is offending God, and they should ask Him what He thinks before attending another meeting.",1203379200,11,627,4.752293577981652
8211336,1,B000TXNU3C,"Worst DVD I ever bought in my life....

Here's why:

1. The DVD case was broken (but that really dosen't matter )

2. For the price that they sell it you expect an original DVD, but no, this DVD was like the ones you burn at home.

3. The documentary was so LOW BUDGET that actually is lame and  embarrassing.

4. The documentary it's like 20 years old.

5. This is a ANTI- MASONIC video. ( but they don't tell you that )

6. ALL THE INFORMATION IN THIS VIDEO IS EIGHTER FALSE OR INNACURATE .

7. Not reliable at all.

8. I personally think that this DVD is a campaing against freemasonry

DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1198195200,9,621,4.222222222222222
8211337,5,B000TXNU3C,"This is a very informative video.
It was done so well that a masonic friend of mine quit the lodge after viewing it.
He tore up his membership card and handed it to me.
Radical choices have to be made in life.
Either you are of the Saviour, or you are of the devil.
Your choice.
Jesus or Satan, Heaven or Hell.
Christianity or Religion.",1188691200,8,336,4.184615384615385
8211338,1,B000TXNU3C,Watch out for this anti-masonic low quality low budget farse.  It's all the old stereo-types and hatred towards the mixed religions that join together in the masonic fraternity.  Just beware the hard-core sales pitch for right-wing fanatical christians is going to rear it's ugly head.,1187654400,10,285,5.311111111111111
