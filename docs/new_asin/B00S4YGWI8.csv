8697294,5,B00S4YGWI8,"I am surprised to be the first to write a review. This is an amazing box set. 8 individual discs. Wonderful thick clear case. But more importantly is the critical preservation of these films. I wish Donald Trump would take 5 minutes to watch. History can repeat it self. Simon Wiesenthal was a survivor of the Holocaust. He dedicated his entire life to never forget. He inspired leadership and countries to bring former Nazis to justice. The quality of the film's is outstanding. The standard DVD documentry; ""I will never forget,"" is like watching a 1080p Blu Ray. The content, dedication, sacrafice revealed has changed me. I am surprised this set is selling for half the cost. I am sending a donation tomorrow to the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation. This box set and content therein is equivalent to Shoah. After seeing the best picture of 2016; ""Son of Saul "" ...I felt an obligation to revisit history. After reviewing the Simon Wiesenthal story and the education within this set I promise to pass along the torch. I posted a further review on Colorado Film Collectors Facebook page.
