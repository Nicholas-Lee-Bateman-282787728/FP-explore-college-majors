8728585,5,B013RN98S6,"This series is very interesting, and my comments apply to each of the DVDs from this source
If these discs don't dispel the idea of ""the hard-bitten old pros in the symphony orchestra who turn up to play worn out pieces time after time"", then nothing will. Each of the players in this ""scratch orchestra"" are at the top of the profession, and I have not seen anything other than genuine enthusiasm on the faces throughout these performances. Perhaps it could be argued that (using a sporting analogy) that a ""team of champions"" may not always equate to ""a champion team"", but given that these superstars of the profession only meet over a weekend and rehearse and record, there are glimpses of what they COULD achieve if playing together full time. I imagine that the players, each of whom play in outstanding groups on a daily basis, enjoy the subtle differences produced by the other players in this orchestra. And it is these sounds and nuances which provide each player some novelty, where a range of ""long familiar sounds"" is played in a different manner than at their own group.
Each of these episodes features a ""warhorse"" and at least one piece of music that is more recently composed. Whilst one could argue that there are better integrated performances (from full time groups), but these performances are interesting, polished and show some outstanding solo work from all sections of the orchestra.
There is clearly a good deal of respect all round for Gerard Schwarz, and he for them. The interviews are all interesting in their own right, and most players express the feeling of honour at being part of the group.
These programmes are well worth the money, and I look forward to future editions from this orchestra and conductor.",1512864000,,1741,4.806666666666667
8728586,5,B013RN98S6,"The performances on this recording are really good, but the best part for me is the recording quality is crystal clear. The video shows of featured instruments as they're playing. I think it's a wonderful video for older children or maybe young teens as an intro to orchestral music, but people of any age can enjoy it.",1458172800,,319,4.614035087719298
8728587,4,B013RN98S6,"A grown-up Young People's Concerts series for today's audiences. Beautiful sound and picture, and you can't be a rousing interpretation of American and Russian repertoire (my compliments to the musicians on the Copland). A keeper!",1448841600,2,230,5.6
8728588,4,B013RN98S6,"Good quality video and sound. Was hoping for Blueray, but still satisfied.",1448409600,,74,5.25
8728589,5,B013RN98S6,"This is one of six volumes of a series of DVDs by The All-Star Orchestra  a project by conductor Gerard Schwarz in which he invited the top musicians from the top US orchestras (Seattle, Philadelphia, etc)  including a few concertmasters.  to play together in a studio (without an audience) and record it in high def video (but not Bluray) and sound. This is the only volume I have seen and I chose it primarily for Program # 9  titles Visions of New York. I chose this because Schwarz was using the original jazz orchestrations for Gershwins Rhapsody in Blue, performing Aaron Copelands Music for Theater (which  has actually nothing to do with theater, except for its title) and a new piece composed in commemoration of the 9/11 World Trade Center bombings that was composed in 2001 a month after the tragedy.

Schwarz introduces each of the first two compositions and the composer of Ground 0  Robert Beaser  introduces his piece.
Program #10 is a straight ahead performance of Scherazade. It was fine, but not the reason I was attracted to this volume.
There is a four page insert in the package which lists the contents of all 12 programs, and provides the names of all the musicians involved (there are well over 100 , though only some are in each program (and there is- unfortunately  no list of who performs in which volume.

At the beginning there is a large G on the screen in upper left corner so this series may have been originally produced for TV but I cant be certain.
Based on this volume, I can certainly recommend this  and other volumes  to those who appreciate classical music.

I hope that this review was both informative and helpful.
