2676598,4,B000JLTRFY,"It is hard for some people in this film to distinguish good people from bad. The movie is filled with humor, as well as lots of shooting. In fact, the comedian Buddy Hacket appears for about a minute grimacing humorously without getting his name mentioned among the credits, and John Carradine, who usually plays a fearsome man, has a long comedy part, and he smiles.

It is around 1900. There are many cars on the street of this small western town. Robert Mitchum has been the town marshal for twenty years and is nearing old age. He hears that an older acquaintance of his, George Kennedy, a train robber, is coming to town with his gang to rob a train. Mitchum tries to persuade the mayor to allow him to form a posse, but the mayor is more interested in the election, coming in two weeks, and doesn't want to rile up the citizens. (This concern comes second to his interest in sleeping with the wife of another man.) The mayor protects himself against Mitchum's protestations by retiring him. Undaunted, Mitchum decides to go after Kennedy himself. He captures Kennedy in a comical manner, but the mayor doesn't want a disturbance and doesn't want him placed in jail. Mitchum brings him to his home and Kennedy is surprised to discover an indoor toilet.

The gang arrives in town and one of them shoots Mitchum's friend in the back. Mitchum is now more determined than ever to stop the gang and their robbery. But he is one oldish man against a gang of young men. Kennedy is outraged by the back shooting and agrees to join Mitchum in stopping the gang. They decide to board the train while it is speeding and persuade or force the driver to drive through town without stopping so that the gang will be unable to rob it. Or, so they think.

 Viewers will enjoy the almost ""keystone cop"" antics on the train by conductors who think Mitchum and Kennedy are robbers (Carradine is one of them) and the almost ridiculous chase by the town people after the train, led on by the mayor who sees an opportunity to gain good publicity. Will the overly-honest Mitchum consider Kennedy a good guy now since he helped him and most likely saved his life?",1301184000,3,2144,4.546632124352332
2676599,5,B000JLTRFY,"This is a great movie. It is typical of Robert Mitchum. He is a really great actor who has been undersold by the Oscars. But then again, the Oscars did not really like John Wayne either?",1300924800,,186,4.194444444444445
2676600,5,B000JLTRFY,"This is a very fine wide-screen production (2.35.1) by Warner. It was filmed in the state of New Mexico in the fall and the scenery is spectacular.

Robert Mitchum plays Sheriff James Flagg who, it would seem, has outlived his usefulness. He hears that a famous train robber from the old days, Big John McKay (George Kennedy), is planning a robbery in the town of Progress. The Sheriff tries to warn the Mayor, who takes no notice and replaces him with a younger, incompetent man. Following complications, Flagg and Big John join forces: they are pursued by outlaws and a frantic train chase ensues.

Mitchum and Kennedy are wonderful as men used to the Old West, not comfortable living in a more modern age. Ignore the critics, because this is a fun-filled movie and well worth seeing.",1289174400,,786,4.7299270072992705

George Kennedy shines in this film, but Martin Balsam steals the show.  However, in the first scene, one of Douglas V. Fowley's lines is cut, and then Bob Steele appears immediately afterward as an engineer in the scene where the prostitutes are being loaded on the train, and his part's cut from the film!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head-Em-Off-At-the-Pass-94-Westerns-You-Should-Watch/dp/1460905016/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should Watch</a>",1173398400,5,673,6.063157894736842
8151915,3,B000JLTRFY,This is a pretty good.  Under rated movie.  Isaw it on t.v with my Dad.  Who I think had already seen it.  Robert Mitchum plays a Marshal who has been retired.  And He and George Kennedy play off each other well.  David Carradine in a  early role is a good villain.  And there is one really funny scene in a train tunnel that always makes me laugh everytime I see it.  It's a good movie.  but it seems like it tries a bit too much to be like Cat Ballou.,1492300800,,453,3.933333333333333

8151924,2,B000JLTRFY,"If you didn't already get it from the title - ""The Good Guys and the Bad Guys"" - this is a tongue-in-cheek western from Burt Kennedy. It stars Robert Mitchum and George Kennedy as aging rivals from opposite sides of the legal fence, who must join forces and confront their own decline in the face of a changing west.

Robert Mitchum (1917-97) received his only Oscar nomination for his role in ""The Story of GI Joe"", but movie fans know that Mitchum was a terrific actor who deserved far more acknowledgement, but his ""bad boy"" persona undoubtedly interfered. Mitchum is probably best known for his performances as Philip Marlowe, and his work in films like ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955) and ""Cape Fear"" (1962). He is ranked by AFI as among the top 100 villains of all time. I liked him best as the drunken sheriff in ""El Dorado"" (1966). Mitchum plays a retired sheriff.

George Kennedy (1925) is best remembered for his role as the convict who beats up Paul Newman in ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) for which he won the Oscar. He could play a good guy (e.g., Major Armbuster in ""Dirty Dozen"", Chris in ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"", Patton in ""Brass Target"") and a villain (e.g., Red in ""Thunbderbolt and Lightfoot"", Ben Bowman in ""The Eiger Sanction"") and was also adept at comedy (e.g., ""Airport 1975"", ""The Naked Gun""). Kennedy plays an outlaw, and Mitchum's nemesis. Kennedy had gone straight, gotten married, and had a child, but when his wife died, he returned to his evil ways (Obviously Clint Eastwood was inspired this film).

Martin Balsam (1919-96) plays the town's mayor, and is clearly the inspiration for Mel Brooks' role in ""Blazing Saddles"". Balsam won the Oscar for ""A Thousand Clowns"" (1965), had two BAFTA nominations (""All the President's Men"", ""The Taking of Pelham 123""), and an Emmy nomination (""Raid on Entebbe""). He gave good dependable performances in more than 100 films.

John Davis Chandler (1935-2010) plays a gunslinger. Chandler specialized in playing villains in nearly 100 films, often westerns such as ""Ride the High Country"" (1962), ""Major Dundee"" (1965), and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976)

David Carradine (1936-2009)  is best known as Kwai Chang Caine from the TV series ""Kung Fu"" and from the ""Kill Bill"" films. He appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated for a Golden Globe 4 times and for an Emmy once. Carradine plays the leader of the outlaw gang, who ousted Kennedy because he is too old.

David's father, John Carradine (1906-88 ) plays a conductor on the train that is at the climax of the film. He was a part of John Ford's Stock Company and gave memorable performances in ""Prisoner of Shark Island"" (1936), ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940). He's best known to us today for his continuing role as Serenity Johnson in son David's TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-1975).

Douglas Fowley (1911-98) makes another memorable appearance, this time as a hermit and long time friend of Mitchum. Fowley appeared in more than 200 films and is probably best known for his role as Roscoe Dexter in ""Singing in the Rain"" (1952). Fowley had a mini-career on TV with a full beard and his best ""Gabby"" Hayes imitation, and that's how he looks in this film. He's so good you won't recognize him.

Burt Kennedy (1922-2001) directed nearly 50 films, many of them westerns, including ""The Rounders"" (1965), ""Return of the Seven"" (1966), ""The War Wagon"" (1967), and ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" (1969). Most of his westerns had strong comedic elements. By the 1970s he was working primarily in TV, again making TV westerns. He got his break as a writer from John Wayne and worked with Budd Boetticher and Randolph Scott on their westerns.

Roger Ebert called it ""a fairly good western"" but noted ""the movie never seems quite sure whether it's serious or not."" Regarding the star, Ebert said ""Mitchum eventually has to carry the picture, as he has carried so many before, and his scenes work even when they shouldn't."" The NY Times was not so kind - ""there's nothing even mildly compelling about this anemic, fumbling and altogether aimless little exercise that soundly squanders some fetching color scenery and a trio of professionals like Robert Mitchum and two Oscar-winners, George Kennedy and Martin Balsam.""

In 1969 ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was the big box office king, followed by ""The Shoot Horses Don't They?"", ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", and ""Easy Rider"". ""True Grit"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" rounded off the top 10. So it was a great year for westerns. The big Oscar winner was ""Midnight Cowboy"" (Picture, Director) and John Wayne won his only Oscar for ""True Grit"". Other notable films that year were ""Hello Dolly"", ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""Putney Swope"" and ""Z"".

There have been more than 100 ""comedy westerns"". Here's a list of some of the best: Mel Brooks' hilarious ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974), Lee Marvin's Oscar winning ""Cat Ballou"" (1965), Billy Crystal in ""City Slickers"" (1991), Bob Hope's ""Son of Paleface"" (1952), Jimmy Stewart's ""Destry Rides Again"" (1939), Gene Wilder as ""The Frisco Kid"" (1979), the Marx Brothers' ""Go West"" (1940), W.C. Fields and Mae West in ""My Little Chickadee"" (1940), Don Knotts as ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"" (1968), Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood in ""Paint Your Wagon"" (1969), and James Garner's ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" (1969).

Against these classics, ""The good guys..."" doesn't stack up that well. At its core, it simply isn't that funny and as an action western it fails too.",1305936000,,5524,4.870074547390841
