8461501,2,B0058FFGTM,This case was advertised as blu-ray but was not actually the blu-ray sized case steelbook. The disc obviously fits because the discs are a standard size but for people who buy these as collectors items this was sold with bad info because it is not blu-ray sized.,1503705600,,262,4.595744680851064
8461502,2,B0058FFGTM,"This case IS an official Steelbook, not a ""Viva Metal"" box like Disney uses (used?) in the U.S. now-a-days.  However, it is a DVD size Steelbook.
There are only two overlapping disc holders on the right side of the inside casing - obviously made for the DVD release, NOT the Blu-ray (since the [2D] Blu-ray has three discs [2 BDs and 1 DVD] worth keeping [the digital copy disc is a throw-a-way, after the code is claimed]).
There is full color print on both the interior and exterior.
I am disappointed with this.  I was expecting a Blu-ray size Steelbook,not DVD size.  The listing shouldn't have Blu-ray in it.  (Yes, it can hold BDs. I can also hold CDs though. So, hmmpf.)  It is clearly made for DVDs though.

This, of course, only applies to the version I received from a third party reseller on Amazon.

There is a barcode on the back, which I haven't seen on a Steelbook before.  It is 7-12725-02172-6.

I am still glad I bought it, since I collect Disney/Pixar and Steelbooks.",1390435200,,986,4.52542372881356
