5049389,5,B00722MQE2,"Everyone knows that special-ed teens are capable of only menial work, and would be very much out of place with gifted students at a space camp. Right? Almost everyone thought so, but was proved wrong.

The coach had a vision and dream for his students. To him, conventional special ed camps were uninspiring. He said, ""I am sick and tired of others saying that these kids cannot do anything.""

Why not try something unheard of--space camp? The challenges are formidable. NASA must be convinced to permit this. He has to raise fifty thousand dollars. He must get his students to believe in themselves and to work together. Some of them must overcome their saucy attitudes when corrected. They must stop insulting and fighting with each other. If they make it to camp and fight, it will only support those who contend that special ed teens do not belong at space camp.

The students drill and practice. They memorize mountains of facts. They learn to assemble a triangle underwater in a swimming pool. One of them assembles a large plastic model of the shuttle that an adult would have difficulty building. One of them becomes the leader that he is capable of being. So much work is involved!

The photography of the NASA equipment at the space camp is outstanding. You get to see a spin-simulator, virtual-reality shuttle interior, and much more.

The door for the students opens and the spotlight is on them. So says the coach. The rest is history.",1327881600,14,1448,4.752988047808765
5049390,5,B00722MQE2,"Watched it on network TV. It was inspiring. No spoilers here, but this movie should be shown to all teachers along with Ron Clark and Front of the Class. It's that good. It shows that special education kids are not dumb; rather, they can accomplish a great deal with the extra help they often need.  They may learn differently, but they do learn. Loved the video and I will show it to my Psychology (high school) students in my Learning Unit.
I can heartily recommend this movie without reservation.",1327795200,26,499,4.606741573033708

5049449,5,B00722MQE2,"I teach 17-21 year old special needs students.  This is a wonderful uplifting movie that emphasizes the abilities and talents of students that some see as disabled.

5049450,4,B00722MQE2,"A Smile as Big as the Moon tells the true story of a special education teacher who tries to get his students to highly competitive Space Camp.  The students struggle with a variety of disabilities: ADHD, Tourettes, OCD, dyslexia, bipolar disorder, autism, etc.  Yet he sets the bar high and pits them against high-achieving students from other schools.

The film is fairly typical Hallmark fare--and that is a good thing.  It is a predictable but nonetheless inspiring, feel-good story.  For those who are used to Hollywood movies that focus on the gritty (and often depressing) side of life, this film will seem cheesy.  But for those of us who have grown tired of gritty, this is a breath of fresh air.

I was pleased with the visual quality of this DVD.  It was as good as some Blu-ray transfers I have seen.  Good level of detail and strong colors.  The audio was a bit problematic, however.  Dialogue was strong, but the soundtrack was soft to the point of distraction.  It would have benefitted from more volume.

Parental Advisory: Apart from some occasional bullying and flaring tempers, there is nothing objectionable in this film.  It is suitable for all ages.  In fact, parents could use this film as a good launching point for a discussion with their children about bullying.

If you are looking for some heart-warming, family entertainment, look no further.  Highly recommended.",1372896000,3,1391,4.901287553648069
5049451,5,B00722MQE2,"This movie exceeded my expectation.  I loved the dedication of a committed teacher who saw the potential in his pupils to succeed and then fight to give them the opportunity to do just that.  This is the stuff Heroes are made of.
A must see for all teachers/ parents, who consider themselves challenged by their pupils/childrens attitudes or physical, or emotional abililities.",1372204800,,377,5.064516129032258
5049452,5,B00722MQE2,"This is an amazing and inspiring story that will touch your heart.  Faith in those you love/trust, and what seems impossible actually can become tomorrow's reality.  All the kids needed was a fair chance.  Putting their special educational needs on the back burner for awhile and these kids(and the teachers who believed in them) showed that intelligience is not always measured by one's IQ. This is a true live story that will erase many of your doubts about those who can and those who are labelled ""incapable because....""

As a Single parent of a special needs child, it brings hope that there are a few teachers out there that care about our kids and not just a paycheck.

Excellent for showing that ALL kids, no matter what you 'label' them, they ALL have talents that are amazing and they ALL can succeed.

5049470,5,B00722MQE2,"I've watched it 3 times on t.v. and have autotune set for tomorrows broadcast as well. It is not an understatement that every person should see this: kids and adults.

It shows how every person, no matter how young or old, has a craving in their heart to be accepted, loved, valued, and approved. It shows you how determination and using your God-given talents will help you achieve goals. Teamwork and being kind to others are 2 themes brought up as well.

The writers / producers did an excellent job. Every scene is important and I never felt like they were just padding the movie with senseless scenes like I see in 'popular' movies. Come to think of it: I don't think I've ever seen a Hallmark Movie where I thought they were just trying to fill up time with senseless scenes!

Every single actor was perfectly cast in their role. John Corbett is one of the few people I enjoy watching as an actor - he's so natural in his roles! (He was the fiance in My Big Fat Greek Wedding.)",1328313600,7,983,4.3901098901098905
8508685,5,B00722MQE2,It is the most Wonderful movie out there. It truly touches the heart.,1529452800,,69,4.384615384615385
8508686,5,B00722MQE2,"""A Smile As Big As The Moon"" stars John Corbett together with Jessy Schram, Logan Huffman,Moira Kelly, and performers who actually have learning disabilities. It is based on the memoir of the special education teacher,Mike Kersjes,who has high dreams for his students with learning disabilities. He intends to raise money for his special-ed students to join the NASA space camp which is a program best suited for intellectually gifted and intelligent students. Since it is a TV movie,we get to see the expected predictability that Mike is able to overcome the obstacles such as lack of funds,non-support of the school administration, and the lack of experience that NASA has in accommodating these type of students. But in spite of these things,I found the movie truly touching and memorable. It tries to tell the message of the triumph of the human spirit and respect for individuals despite their limitations.

Aside from this great story,I also found the portrayal of John Corbett as Mike Kersjes great especially when it presents his character's determination and persistence in allowing his special education students to dream of big things in their life. Also worthy of recognition is Jessy Schram in the role of Robynn as Mike's co-teacher in a special education class. As for Moira Kelly in a minor supporting role,I found her performance as Mike's wife great as well being supportive of her husband's ambitious project and encouraging her husband through the numerous obstacles that he has to overcome and when trying to suggest things to him with dialogues such as ""Genius is keeping things simple"".

Overall,this was a truly inspiring TV movie that reminds us of the triumph of human spirit and encouragement of people to reach for their goals in spite of their physical and mental impairments or limitations. It was also nice to see Moira Kelly once again and being involved in this type of projects despite being only in a supporting role nor a Hollywood superstar rather than being involved in movies that only shows sex and violence and being a Hollywood superstar at that.",1522627200,,2088,5.04927536231884
