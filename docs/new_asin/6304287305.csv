834884,5,6304287305,"After the fall of France in June of 1940, it was the German 6th Army that led the victory parade under the Arc de triomphe.  I remember seeing that parade in the newsreels of that time. Who would have ever guessed that by  February 3, 1943 that same army would be a shambles of corpses and wrecked  equipment littering the steppes around and inside Stalingrad?  This movie  has the dramatic force of a Greek play in which Nemesis takes up the  challenge of the hubris of the Nazi onslaught and with the help of the  weather and inflexible leadership provides a stark retribution. Some of the  soldiers on the train to the fated battle, watch approvingly as they see  ""their"" Russian serfs tending the upcoming harvest. When the  battalion arrives, they are assembled and given a ""pep talk"" by a  political officer.  That scene has to be one of the creepiest ever made.  The arrogance of the officers is starkly portrayed.  The battle scenes are  uncompromisingly brutal.  The vast icy underground hospitals filled with  thousands of untended wounded and the deperate attempts in a driving  snowstorm to fly the wounded out at the Pitomak Airfield  add to the  nightmarish quality of the movie.  The English dubbing of this movie is  masterful.  After viewing this movie, read the ""Ghosts 1942-43""  chapter in Donovan Webster's AFTERMATH and learn why only 90,000 of the  original 330,000 soldiers there, surrendered at Stalingrad after the battle  had ended.",924134400,2,1458,4.897119341563786
834885,5,6304287305,"My major was history in college and I continue to study the subject. My specialty is the Russian-German war. I was especially moved by this film, tragic it may be. It lacks real accuracy in several areas but for an  overall feel of what the greatest war of all time was like it is a must  see. I think anyone really interested in the eastern front needs to see  this picture. Remember, only 5,000 germans returned from this battle alive.  I have read in other reviews that the sexual abuse of the russian female is  excessive. This is only a reminder of the savage nature of war. Stalingrad  will make you really understand what that war was like.",921110400,,647,4.440677966101695
834886,3,6304287305,"Stalingrad is the story of a group of men in a German infantry company who join the siege of Stalingrad during World War Two.  The lieutenant in command is young and somewhat idealistic, and after arriving in the  battered city immediately senses (as does the viewer) that the battle he  and his men are to join is quite different than his experience has prepared  him for.  We follow the lieutenant and a handful of these men as they fight  street to street in the ruins.  The horrors of combat are brought to life  with unflinching frankness. As the film progresses the battle becomes more  desperate and conditions for the men become more and more primitive, almost  in sync with the approach of the Russian winter.  After the German sixth  army becomes trapped, the fight becomes one not subduing their communist  foes, but of maintaining their self respect and honor.  Systematically the  men see all of the institutions they had believed in crumble.  The handful  of men that we get acquainted with (including the lieutenant) become  sentenced to a penal battalion after one of them tries to seek preferential  treatment for an injured friend at their makeshift infirmary.  They are  then required to execute innocent prisoners, and make a suicidal stand  against Russian tanks on the frozen steppe.  Near the end of the film the  remaining survivors plot to escape the death trap that the siege has  become, and desert, relinquishing their vows of loyalty to their cause.  Their only cause now being one of survival.  The most memorable scene in  this film depicts the hordes of soldiers, deserters and wounded mobbing to  get aboard an overladen transport plane, as it begins to taxi forward  amidst the chaos.  The vast majority are left behind in the snow and sounds  of the trampled wounded, the lieutenant and his comrades among them.  This  film is powerful in terms of realism, but lacks slightly in regards to  character development.  It is good film for those who enjoy gritty  unflowery war films.",917049600,,2014,4.869436201780416
834887,4,6304287305,"The pain and hoplessness of the German and Austrian soldiers was well displayed.  The film leads you in a depressing progression as winter sets in and the army becaumes trapped.  The film portrays the crecendo of  demoralization and health which destroyed the army.  However, not enough  notice was made as to why they lost the battle and the circumstances  leading to their downfall.  A great movie for people looking for the human  suffering side of war, but not for the history buff.",912211200,,486,4.841463414634147

835126,4,6304287305,"I'm a big fan of WWII movies, and this one by producers of 'Das Boot' made another hit!

A group of experienced German soldiers return from North Africa for some rest and relaxation on the shores of the Italian coast, only to find themselves hastily recruited to take part in the Battle of Stalingrad. Led by an impressionable officer new to combat, they find themselves in the middle of hell as the German Army in its quest for 'living space' learns the Russians have no idea of giving them the city bearing the name of their leader.

This was one of Thomas Kretschman's early films, and he does a good job as the devoted German officer who comes to learn the Fuhrer's idea of world domination will be the end of them all. It's in Russian, so you'll have to be okay with English subtitles.",1502409600,2,790,4.441379310344828

835133,1,6304287305,"No, sadly the writers (Buscher, Heide and Vilsmaier) wanted to perform a 100% anti-German film in which ALL the actions deemed unacceptable and court martial-worthy were carried out by the Wehrmacht against the somehow noble Russian communists. The writers took a page from the Nuremberg trials by accusing Germany of what the judeo-communists wrought upon Russia, Ukraine and eastern Europe.

Here are some of the crimes committed by the Heer in this film that would have been court martial offenses and in fact WERE offenses German soldiers were prosecuted for whenever they did commit them:
-- Murder of unarmed soldiers
-- Rape and/or mistreatment of non-combatants
-- Desertion
-- Following the order of a superior that led to mistreatment/injury of non-combatants
^Yes, in ""Stalingrad"" the evil Germans committed these atrocities against the poor, oh-so-noble communists. Literally, every time there's an exchange between Germans and Russian citizens, it's this same drumbeat of German abuse against the goodly, hard-working communists.

If this is what the film makers wanted to portray, why did citizens of Ukraine and Russia (during the Wehrmacht's march all the way into the Russian interior) enthusiastically welcome them as liberators? Why did well over 1 million Russian soldiers defect/desert from the Red Army to fight alongside Germany against the USSR? Do you think they may be because these people didn't appreciate the wholesale slaughter of their countrymen at the hands of judeo-communism (led my Lenin, Bronstein/Trotsky and Stalin) from 1917-1941? In the Holodomor (1932-1933) 7 million Ukrainians alone were purposely starved to death as ever scrap of food was confiscated by Red Army personnel to be sold abroad. Oh and these same citizens who ""welcomed them as liberators?"" - they also made their way west with the Wehrmacht's protection when the eastern front broke down. If the German forces were so abusive and murderous, why would so many millions of Ukrainian and Russian people jump at the chance to join them and as a result join their same fate?",1493424000,5,2079,5.296969696969697

835344,5,6304287305,"Americans make their war movies with the biggest budgets, toughest stars, but stereotypical predictable scripts. The British like complex, intellectual war movies done for cheap. Russia makes some of the best war movies around, though good luck getting to see any on this side of the former Iron Curtain. And Germany? Somehow the Germans combine the best of all the war movie making lands, with one caveat: you know your side is going to lose.

Stalingrad follows a young Lieutenant who joins his new infantry unit at the height of Germany's World War II victories. As they drive deeper into the Soviet heartland with each fresh victory, our Lieutenant becomes more disillusioned with the war until his Army becomes hopelessly trapped by the Red Army's surprise Operation Uranus surrounding Stalingrad.

Like American movies, you have action packed battles with quite realistic details. Like the British, you have a philosophical and intellectual discussion of what war in general, and this in particular mean. Like the Russians, you have a visceral gut grinding point of view of war on a very personal level.

835425,3,6304287305,"There are several films on the Battle of Stalingrad. This one is made by the Germans, there is another made by the Russians and there is the most well known of the three, Enemy At the Gates, starring Jude Law, Ed Harris and Rachel Weisz, which is the Hollywood version. This film is the German version. I rated it three stars because while it provides a very realistic feel to the events surrounding the battle, the characters are not written in a substantial way to make you care about them. The film almost has the feel of a docudrama. The film is in German with subtitles in other languages including English. I did not lower it's rating because of subtitles, however. Having seen two of the three Stalingrad films I can say this. Enemy At the Gates is the most entertaining, but it takes liberties with facts and creates Hollywood style resolutions, which irritated me because I have enough knowledge of this battle's history to know it's fiction. But for the average person with very little knowledge of the Battle of Stalingrad, the German and Russian versions of Stalingrad are probably not going to be as entertaing to you as Enemy At the Gates. I do recommend before watching any of these films you read some of the history. You don't need to buy a book. Go to Wikipedia search for Battle of Stalingrad. You'll get enough of the basics so when you watch these films, you know what's fact and what's fiction.",1465257600,4,1416,4.600790513833992

835505,5,6304287305,"A timeless German produced, directed and cast film classic. A great cast that unfortunately, unless you live in Germany, you hardly ever have the opportunity to see preforming in other films.

Just like so many other German cinematic greats....everyone dies before the end of the film. What is with German screen writers and producers? Never mind...I fully understand and don't want to get into that discussion here. However a few other examples come to mind -

""Das Boot"", another great war film. Last minute of the film you look deep into the eyes of the dying U-Boot captain.
""The Tin Drum"", well, almost everyone gets killed, including those who deserved it.
""Aguiree: The Wrath of God"", everyone except the monkey gets killed.
""The Marriage of Maria Braun"", Fassbinder's absolute best film and...yes the lead character dies.

I'm not condemning Stalingrad at all and I highly recommend watching it. At the time it was made Hollywood could never have come up with anything like this. Stalingrad and the whole of the eastern front was a real meat grinder. There was mind boggling numbers of casualties and destruction. There is nothing romantic about this or any kind of warfare at all. When you watch the film note how the mood of the characters change from the starting 10 minutes compared to the scene where the troops arrive at the rail station.

835587,4,6304287305,"At the core of war is the process of dehumanization. Dehumanization's process is demonstrated by the action of this movie. There's no hero's journey in the story. Yet elements of it seem to be present.

The central protagonist is a small unit of German soldiers, storm troopers, originally Hitler's personal army, elite fighters. A lieutenant represents the old-school German, military class; he is of a military family, his father, himself an officer. And then there is a few regular guys, soldiers, grunts. They are seen traveling on the train to the Russian front after enjoying leave in Italy. It is the summer of the German, second offensive against Stalingrad. No sense is conveyed about either of these characters that they fight the war for ideological reasons. These are guys, despite fighting for Nazis, are regular guys that could be citizens of any country.

In Stalingrad, the army unit is thrust into hellish conditions. Prior to our being placed within those hellish conditions, we see a Nazi religious service. Preaching, the religious minister says: ""God is with us,"" these words are ascribed on storm trooper's belt buckle. Our work is holy work. There is no holier work than defending Western Christain values against Eastern Bolshevism. That is what sets you apart from the Bolsheviks, who have no time for God. You are never alone. Even when deep within enemy territory."" Yet the opposite theme is what the story portrays. The army is left on its own, hence very much isolated during the encirclement done by the Soviet army.

In the course of the film's story, we witness well-meaning men thrust into absurdly impossible conditions. Their degradation is shown. Despite each one having to endure severely harsh conditions, even for war conditions, each is able to demonstrate some inkling of humanity towards each other.

Ultimately, the system and its order breakdown completely. In time, the unit of German soldiers depends on the aid of a Soviet woman soldier. At that point marked division between two sides of enemy conflict has broken down altogether. No end comes to all the unit of soldiers.",1445904000,4,2120,5.048571428571429

While 'Das Boot' successfully captures the claustrophobic atmosphere of submarine warfare, at no point did I feel 'Stalingrad' transported me to the banks of the Volga in 1942/43 . Instead I was aware that the cast and I spent our time either in the buildings of a rundown industrial estate or on a local waste tip covered with artificial snow. At no point did I feel I was on the Eastern Front or witnessing the savagery of the warfare that occurred there. This is not a film in the  league of 'Saving Private Ryan' . Certainly it bares no comparison with Sam Peckinpahs Eastern Front classic 'Cross of Iron' or the iconic Russian masterpiece 'Come and See'.

The acting the direction and the story are very well done.  The complete devastation that was Stalingrad is shown.  I liked the realism that is shown and that soldiers can show emotions such as fear and despair. The battle turns into a fight just to survive the harsh Russian Winter and the dwindling supplies.  There are no spoilers as history tells us the Germans lost and out of an army of 300,000 men only 6,000 were left alive when WWII ended.  How our group of soldiers ends up at the end of the film is the reason you need to watch it.  The war scenes are realistic with out being too graphic. I found myself wanting this group of Nazi's to make it through the battle and I found myself caring for them.  This is very strange because the Nazi's are the bad guys, the invaders, so we should be supporting the Russians, but the director does of good job of making you identify with the soldiers and hoping at least one of them survives.

Theatrically, this movie is good but pales before the Russian Version.  The German troops portrayed center around four or more soldiers fighting in the hell that was Stalingrad.  The military action is continuous thru to the end and performed realistically.  The soldiers are not Nazi's but members of the Wehrmacht, which prior to Hitler pledged its allegiance to the state (the Fatherland), not to a personality (ie, Hitler).  As such the only mentions of Party dogma uttered are done in a cynical or mocking fashion.  One soldier regrets pledging loyalty to Hitler but fights on determindly along with his mates.  Resoluteness, rather than heroism, are the main qualities evidenced by these men.  There are no real sub-plots in this movie, nothing which distracts from the dehumanizing experiencie of Battle by the German soldiers.  Russians are not portrayed to any significant extent, which detracts from the ""balance"" of the film.  The crimes of the SS are also not dealt with. This is a good movie, not a great movie.

835929,4,6304287305,"I really liked this movie and wasn't totally disappointed.  But I did find it long, somewhat defocused and even a bit ""political"" -- or politically correct for the contemporary/European fare. The basic characters/actors were sound.  So was the venue.  The plot was a bit predictable and dilluted.  I mean, this is/was about history and the ill-fated German Army experience in rubbled out Stalingrad.  A disaster of Hitlerian proportions.....an unimaginable (certainly by today's standards) human tragedy on both sides.  My issue with this movie is that I think the messaging/tone was a bit TOO biased against the German Army/or Hitler's ill-advised, crazy over- extended ill-planned (and premature) Russian invasion. The graphic war scenes seems to be the main vehicle the director chose to convey that.  But I mean....were the German troops (and elite Storm Troopers at that) really that 'sensitive' and caring?  Really?  Maybe so.  I wasn't there.  Maybe most felt that way inside.  But I do think that any deserters in the Germany Army (especially insolent/insubordinate junior officers) would probably have been summarily shot on the spot...particularly on the Russian front.  There was NO TIME for human consideration, patience or understanding...or POWs or jailees.  Just follow orders....and kill before getting killed.  I have to believe the Wermacht was a bit more dedicated and 'professional'...and coldly/deadly efficient.  Even in Russia.

So overall I found the movie a bit 'sappy', unseemly and long.  The Russian solider woman and humanized boy soldier were particularly overcooked and seemingly out of place 'sketches' of pathos.  Where was their consummate, permanently infused HATE??!  On both sides??  I mean the Germans killed/executed/butchered  so MANY Russian civilians and wounded Russian soldiers...didn't they?  So did the Russians for that matter.  But despite this movie was well laid out, directed and acted.  Just wish there was a bit more character development and less stylized portrayals too.

Again, this was WWII....and the Eastern Front with all it's savageness by both sides.  Human qualities or considerations were not on the forefront of people's minds or priorities.  Survival and winning was.  It was a bloody, violent, desparate mess.....no good or bad guys (or girls) here.  But -- if I recall correctly -- the Russians were the ones invaded by these German troops, yes?  So by some stretch of definition they were ""good"" going up against ""evil"" and Hitler's wet dreams of world domination.  Perhaps these German soldiers got what they deserved....even if they weren't totally 'bought into it' as this movie seems to constantly want to make a point about throughout the whole story.  What did this movie teach me?  Human kind can be incredibly bad/evil and good/altruistic all in a convoluted sort of way at the same time...magnified by their current harsh, deparate circumstances and  forced 'agenda'.  I think we're all the same underneath it all.  All of us just want to live and let live.

War is hell.  It's that simple...that' undeniably true.  It brings the WORST out of it's real actors.  Before any of you accuse me of not knowing what I'm talking about,  I've been there and been on the tip of the spear....very recently....just not in WWII and Stalingrad. :-)  Anyway, overall a good movie worth viewing and/or buying.

In the same fashion the movie works to more humanize the Nazis as they fought through Stalingrad, it also depicted a cast of men and women from both spectrums of the conflict just trying to survive and live to see another day. The overall story, however, was pretty poorly told.

835971,3,6304287305,"Excellent acting, realistic props. However the bad side is that it is just another anti-Nazis propaganda film, which is very far from, been truthful and unbiased.

Did anyone ever ask why there were so many Russian civilians left in the city by the Bolshevik government?  When in fact they had, a clear route of escape true the back door (Volga River).

In addition, the fact that the Luftwaffe started the air raids of the Volga riverboats two months after the semi-circle of the city was established, thus giving plenty of time for a complete civilian evacuation.

 The air raids over the Volga started when thousands of Russian reinforcement troops were introduce to the city true this back door and pushed to commit suicide by their leaders, just to battle exhaust the German troops and make them run out of supplies. The civilians were kept in the city to provide a demoralizing Partisan supportive force, the Bolshevik could not care less is all of them die it was good for propaganda.

In essence, the Bolsheviks were Demonic Barbarians as Inhuman as their competition The Nazis.

Bolshevik war crimes and genocides against their own peoples, Ukrainians, Poles, Baltics, Finnish, Rumanians, Czechoslovakian s Etc. started long before WWII and continued long after  far surpassing the Nazis crimes against humanity records by millions. However it seems that because they were our allies and use hunger, cold and bullets to execute their victims (with whom we did not sympathize) we chose to look the other way, ignored and strike from the records most of these crimes, which just make us accomplices.

Our leaders shall have been more wise and support General Patton plans instead of eliminating him.

The supply ferries that the russians sent across the Volga river should have been a top priority for the luftwaffe dive bombers.  The russian strategy of feeding just enough troops into the city, to forstall a german victory, while reinforcing their flanks proved to be successful.  Marshall Zhukov's encirclement operation in november of 1942, caught the germans by complete surprise.  The army should have been withdrwan at that point, it was still possible to do so.  Goring's folly in insisting that he could supply sixth army by air, was an empty boast.  The sixth army was left to its fate, after Gen. Manstein's attempt to break through to the trapped army.  It was a sad end to a military force that deserved better treatment fron its high command.  In the end Hitler shoulders much of the blame.

This movie is ""not rated"", but if it were, I believe the rating would be ""R"" for these reasons:
* language
* gore
* violence

The foul language is sprinkled throughout the movie.  There are some f-bombs in addition to the usual stuff.  It's not gratuitous, and it wasn't enough to make me want to turn it off.

The gore includes soldier's limbs being blown-off, being shot-up, and a body being blown in two by a tank shell.

The movie follows a platoon of German soldiers as they fight in Russia; you get to know some of them personally through dialogue.  There is camaraderie among them, as well as disagreement with their leaders and the Nazi movement.

The battle scenes were realistic.

The movie starts with the soldiers fighting during summer, but then it switched to cold weather and winter...but it was difficult to tell when that switch occurred (just saw their breaths due to the cold...although the snow was evident later in the movie).

836214,5,6304287305,"I am a huge fan of WWII movies. This movie is less about the battle and more about the men, in this case a small group of German Wehrmacht soldiers, and horror of their ordeal in the long, cold, futile battle of Stalingrad. Stalingrad is in a league of its own showing the brutal reality of this war. It is not an american movie, it does not have hollywood star power, there is no real political agenda, and there are certainly not any heros. It is what a war movie should be - allowing the viewer to see and realize the pain, suffering and erosion of hope that many soldiers endured - most other war movies focus on the glory of battle this one focuses on the gore. The final scene brings it all home as Russia's best weapon, the weather (which also defeated Napoleon), literally engulfs the last survivors of this tale and leaves one with a hollow feeling.

The movie in German and English so you can pick the language, or watch in German with English subtitles. I highly recommend this movie and consider it to be one of the top WWII movies every made. Keep in mind this is a battle between Russian and German soldiers in Russia fought between the summer of 1942 and winter of 1943, there are no Americans in this battle. Highly recommended.",1313193600,5,1244,4.408695652173913
836215,4,6304287305,"""Stalingrad"", by the German producer of the epic submarine movie ""Das Boot"", tells the fictional story of a platoon of German soldiers from their transfer from Italy into Stalingrad until the final German surrender in early 1943.  Although in my opinion this is not as good of a movie as ""Das Boot"", it has much to recommend it.

The acting and photography are top notch, as is the sense of realism.  There are two battle scenes in the movie, an attack on an important factory, and a defense against a mixed Soviet infantry-tank force.  The attack on the factory in particular is very convincing.  I recently read ""Island of Fire"", an outstanding book  by Mr Jason Mark which describes, in great detail, the fighting in and around the Barrikady Gun Factory in Stalingrad.  The factory scenes from the movie could have almost been a reenactment from some of the real-life attacks depicted in the book.  Many scenes from the movie, such as the departure of the last transport plane to leave Stalingrad, are very moving and give you a sense of the desperation felt by the starving German forces as the Soviet noose inexorably tightened.

However, I found some things in the movie that didn't ring true.  For example, near the beginning of the movie, one of the German soldiers was insubordinate during an award ceremony and to his commanding officer a short time later while on a train, and was not punished, apart from having his decoration revoked.  Having read many books about the Wehrmacht, this soldier would not have acted this way, and if he had, he would have been punished severely.  Another example is that there are several direct and indirect anti-war and anti-Hitler references in the movie.  No matter how the individual soldier may have felt, he would not dared to openly shown those types of sentiments in public.

Since this movie is about Stalingrad, you know it's probably not going to end well for the German protagonists, so it's a fairly dark, somewhat depressing film.  It's gritty and you get a sense of getting to know some of the characters.  But this film didn't grab me the same way ""Das Boot"" did.  It's well made, though, and tells a story that not many Americans are familiar with.  I recommend the movie to World War II buffs.",1284076800,7,2256,4.726342710997442
836216,5,6304287305,"STALINGRAD , released in 1993, remains one of the most brutally honest depictions of war on film. A brief history of the facts behind this film have been well stated: 'The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in southwestern Russia. It took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as the turning point of the war in Europe. The German offensive to take Stalingrad, the battle inside the city and the Soviet counter-offensive--which eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city--was the first substantial German land defeat of the war. The battle involved more participants than any other on the Eastern Front, and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties by both sides. It was amongst the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million.'  The horror of this battle as written by J&uuml;rgen B&uuml;scher, Christoph Fromm, Johannes Heide, and director Joseph Vilsmaier manages to allow us to see the 'other side' of the German forces, those not committed to the Nazi hunger for world domination, but instead were simply men serving their required time in the army, hoping to return to their families.

The film opens with a prelude:  German troops of the 6th Army are languishing in Italy after their successful mission in North Africa.  They are soon assigned to attack a port in Russia - a place called Stalingrad - and off they go to what is perceived to be another quick victory.  The unit is directed by Lt. Hans von Witzland (Thomas Kretschmann, in a role that should have won him every award possible, so fine is his performance): he is a man who appears more human than soldier and indeed when his troop arrives in Russian territory he is appalled by the treatment of Russian POWs by German officers, a response that places him in a negative light with the Nazis. But Witzland is assigned to take a Russian strong hold with the close help of his group of fellow soldiers (played with extraordinary humanity by Dominique Horwitz, Sebastian Rudolph, Oliver Broumis et al).  For a moment in time they are successful heroes but their commitment to the war is rapidly and fully eroded by the slaughter around them and the orders from the heinous Nazi officers to treat the Russians with less than dignity.  They are threatened with death by firing squad for their humanity in attempting to give aid to the Russians being constantly attacked and only released form their prisoner status when the war appears to be aimed toward loss. There are many very tender moments between the 6th army and the Russians trapped by the siege of Stalingrad and as the bitter winter sets in the battle-weary soldiers are dying, committing suicide or attempting to escape and find their way back home.  The over two hour study of the cruelty of war ends with a solemn statement, both emotionally and visually and the Battle of Stalingrad, a victory of the Russians, shows the defeat of the minds (and lives) of the Germans.

The film is brave in its commitment to address the fact that the universal 'German image' of World War II is a negative one. This film focuses on individual ideals and the scarring that war, on both sides, leaves on the soldiers and people who survive it.  Highly recommended.

836218,4,6304287305,"I liked this movie , although it like most modern war movies doesn't really reflect the attitudes of most people of the time. the dvd looks pretty good though, it's a german movie dubbed into english.  but this doesn't reflect what the real situation was mainly,  The soldiers fighting in stalingrad mostly believed in what they were doing , both sides fought to the death with neither army accepting any dissention. In fact even after they'd lost the axis soldiers mostly were sure they were right. It wasn't until many years later that they'd realized that they were fighting for a nightmarish regime and that they were often robotic in their worship of that regime.  Hopefully people who watch this will watch real documentaries about the battle. The latest on secrets of the dead tv show proved that stalin told his men to hold and not to retreat in this area which cost the soviets many lives. The legend was that he retreated and lead Hitler into a trap which just isn't true.  But this flick does show the brutality of war and hopelessness of the men trapped in stalingrad where only 5,000 men out of the whole 6th army would ever return home.  So I would say it's a good war movie done without cgi.  This movie follows a small group of men in the battle of course it can't do the real battles horrors justice. Not even the higher budget 'enemy at the gates' could do that!  But fans of war movies should enjoy this one and they shouldn't mind the subtitles either.

836270,3,6304287305,"This movie, portraying the battle for Stalingrad from the German point of view was fairly entertaining and, of course, cruelly graphic in many parts.  As a student of history myself and fairly familiar with the fighting on the Eastern Front, I found many of the inaccuracies and downright distortions of what really happened somewhat disappointing.

Firstly, the movie seems to go out of its way to show the average German soldier to be generally insolent, defiant and cynical.  In the opening scenes, at an awards presentation in Italy, several of the main characters arrive late(!) and then, as medals are being awarded, one of the soldiers, a sergeant named Rohleder, is blatantly disrespectful to his commanding officer forcing the senior officer presiding to revoke the sergeant's award.  Surely, in reality, such behaviour, in front of an entire courtyard of soldiers and officers no less, would have been punished much more severely than that, possibly with a spell in the stockade or immediate demotion in rank.

Next, we see enlisted men laughing at their commanding officer while riding through Russia in a rail car.  Sergeant Rohleder again shows his insolence when he bets the Lieutenant in charge, a Lieutenant von Witzland, that he will survive the war while the Lieutenant will not - offering a mere case of water as 'payment' should he lose.  Perhaps the most shockingly inaccurate scene is when Lieutenant von Witzland later sees a German security man beat a Russian prisoner to death.  He tries to intervene but instead is knocked to the ground.  As he lay in a puddle of muddy water, other German soldiers merely step around him while his own company continues to march off as though nothing has happened.  In reality, this security man would have immediately been seized and arrested, more than likely by the Lieutenant's own men.  Further, this security man would also have been severely punished, possibly even executed, not only for beating a Russian prisoner to death but for striking an officer in the process.

Another distortion can be seen during close combat in a ruined factory when von Witzland is shown, after a disturbing encounter with a wounded Russian soldier, heaving and crying hysterically in front of his men, even bemoaning the fact that the incident made him 's*** in his pants' because he 'couldn't control it'.  With such behaviour guaranteed to shake the confidence of the troops under him, this Lieutenant would have been quickly relieved of duty for showing such a blatant lack of courage and fortitude in battle.

Other scenes that are worth mentioning for their downright bias if not inaccurate portrayal:  a soldier shown shaking his head in disgust while fellow troops listen to Hitler giving a speech on the radio, von Witzland jumping up and abruptly shutting off the same broadcast, Russian troops scurrying about a courtyard attempting to 'pick up their wounded' during a lull in the fighting - something rare bordering on the preposterous for Soviet troops seldom showed such humanity to their wounded.  In fact, if they were poking around amongst piles of dead and wounded it would only be to gather up weapons and ammunition - certainly not to administer first aid nor comfort to the dying.  And if that wasn't ridiculous enough, this same scene is followed by von Witzland arranging a truce so all could come out of hiding and assist their wounded together.  Of course in actuality, the Russians may very well have agreed to a truce but only to lure the naive Lieutenant and his men out into the open so they could be quickly gunned down.

Such was the savagery of war on the Eastern Front which, it would seem, was too much even for the writers and producers to portray.  But, then again, I suppose a movie about Soviet savagery and brutality in Stalingrad, or anywhere else on the Eastern Front for that matter, is just not a politically correct nor sexy enough subject for the big screen. As we are all conditioned to believe, the Germans make much better villains.

Notice especially the scene showing German soldiers in retreat, burning down Russian villages and driving the inhabitants out into the cold.  It was, however, common knowledge that, in reality, doing so made little tactical sense, the smoke often alerting the Russians to the German intentions and very likely provoking an immediate counterattack.  Since the burning of entire villages and execution of many of its inhabitants was often a mark of the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, which generally torched all dwellings to deprive Germans troops of warmth and shelter, it is rather strange but not entirely unexpected that the producers chose to deliberately ignore this.  As well, civilians who dared to resist such attempts by the NKVD were almost always shot on the spot, while the rest were driven off into the surrounding woodlands with no food, water nor protection from the winter weather.

I could go on but I think what I have indicated is enough to illustrate that this movie is hardly an accurate portrayal of the actual battle of Stalingrad especially regarding the training and fortitude of the average German soldier.  Rather, it is an attempt to show the German as brutal, pitiful, undisciplined, insolent and disloyal.

As any historian will no doubt admit, nothing could be further from the truth.",1261008000,11,5344,4.961883408071749

836272,4,6304287305,"I think Second World War has always been a favorite subject for Movie Making.

Ever since movies like Saving Private Ryan & Thin Red Line hit the big screen we have seen a series of new techniques to uphold the gritty images and the brutality of the War.

Past has always romanticized the subject on World War, pre Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.

Well we have seen so many movies from Hollywood which has always shown us the story from the Allies POV.

It was refreshing to see movies like `Downfall' `Stalingrad', because it really gave us some idea what it was like to be on the other side.

`Stalingrad' can be said as a War Drama, rather than only action oriented Movie.

More aspect has been given to the humane elements to make it more memorable. I think almost every one knows why Stalingrad had been so memorable name in the annals of History. This was the war which was considered to be the most bloody and brutal war of 21st Century. This is where Germans had started to lose the war and their complete 6th Army was annihilated.

`Stalingrad' starts with the story of a German company which gets redeployed from El Alamein Campaign (North Africa) to Stalingrad to push back the Russian Offence. We get introduced to some of the men who will be there through out the movie and we see the confrontation through their eyes. For the most part, the characters which was most unforgettable to me was the battle hardened Corporal Fritz Reiser (enacted by Dominique Horwitz) and the inexperienced idealistic Platoon Leader Lieutenant Von Witzland (brilliantly performed by Thomas Kretschmann).

As said earlier this Movie has only two major battle scenes, one happens within the Factory Compound at Stalingrad and the other one is a well portrayed Soviet Mixed Tank Infantry Offence on a prepared German Positions. Action scenes were well executed and since there was less amount of CGI it was realistic. Note this movie was five years prior to `Saving Private Ryan' and taking into consideration that I would say the special effects were really good. For couple of times I have mentioned SPR* because I think when it comes to absolute realistic graphic violence SPR * has benchmarked the Movie Industry how a War Movie should be depicted.

Overall this movie will be enjoyed by those who like Genre based on Second World War.

836278,3,6304287305,"Certainly is interesting to see the German perspective of WWII, the Eastern Font was much greater in scope and even importance than the Western Front.  Stalingrad is probably the bloodiest battle ever fought and the stakes were certainly high, this battle marked the high water tide for the German side and the losses the Wehrmacht and the Axis forces suffered could never be recovered thus leading to the loss of the war with the Soviet Union.

This being said, you would expect a much larger movie in scope, I know this is not a documentary and you should appreciate the art of the film making but I certainly did no gain a new insight on the battle after seeing it.  This is because the scope is of the battle seen from the point of view of a platoon.  We are never explained how the battle was fought and why it was lost.  The battle scenes are few and far between, I can recognize these were well crafted but they are preceded and followed by a generic moralistic story of a young commander comming to terms with handling a much more experienced platoon of soldiers and running afowl of Nazi officers who mistreat prisoners.  The officer in question tries to get help for a gravely wounded soldier in his platoon by resorting to violence, this lands him in a penal batallion (together with some members of the platoon)and has to endure starvation and penury.  Later he redeems himself by fighting against the odds with a Soviet tank column and destroying it, this is the best part of the movie. We have some side stories dealing with a child and an improbable quasi-romance with a russian woman-soldier.  In the end the platoon attempts to scape by trying to be airlifted with the wounded and failing this by trying to infiltrate the Soviet lines and trying to gain german lines through the worst possible winter conditions and in the end everybody perishes.

You have to see the plight of the platoon as a representation of the suffering of all the German 6th Army.  I am a war film buff but this film somehow bored me, as I said before it needed to convey a wider spectrum of the battle, you needed to gat a feeling of the strategic implications for both sides.  In the end you get a very generic movie.  It missed a very good chance of presenting this battle as the real cataclysm it really was. I wish this story was presented with the scope for example the Market Garden Operation was presented in the film A Bridge to Far.  The Stalingrad Battle deserves a better treatment.  Even the film Enemy at the Gates misses the mark even though it portrays some very interesting aspects such as the crossing of the Volga by the Russian reinforcements, but it also lacks scope.

My only complaint is they tend to portray the german soldiers as cry babies, deserters, remorseful, disobedient, and un-tough. I'd say that's very far from the real truth. The german soldier was as good as he was because he wasn't any of those things. Obviously with so many german soldiers in this battle you would find some of these kinds of people but all together in one company? That's hard to believe. I'd say the majority of them were not remorseful at all. And they surely wouldn't have survived as long as they did had they been disobedient slackers. That was a little irritating.

836384,4,6304287305,"I enjoyed watching a war film from an all German perspective.  I found the German soldiers to be faithfully represented in everything from their haircuts to their equipment, and their weapons. Unlike Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, in which the Germans were portrayed in a manner not truthfully represented for history's sake, the movie Stalingrad is an excellent account of a very small slice of one of the most brutal battles in World War Two. Of course it has anti-war overtones which are apparent throughout the movie, and become even more so near the end, climaxing in the snow drifts of a brutal Russian Winter, we find the Sixth army trapped and surrounded by the Russian soldiers, who are accurately portrayed, and who take a secondary role to the dialog of the disintegrating German Army and soldats who star in this film.  The themes of brutality, discipline to the end, starvation, and disease take the viewer through the horror of war, and its trials and tribulations of friendships ripped apart by senseless murder, and the agony of the wounded soldiers, some with missing limbs and horrible wounds.
To be a little critical, I did find some scenes confusing, and the segway between scenes also a little confusing.  I would like to have seen the larger picture of the German chain of command in action, linking the main characters with the larger German force trying to capture Stalingrad.
But, overall, the movie's theme and tone were nicely put together and I would recommend this movie to the younger generation so they can, one day, make all war illegal and banned from planet Earth, so they will never have to experience the horrors and brutality of warfare.",1196985600,3,1676,4.894366197183099

It doesn't have the most exciting action except in the penal battalion snow battle scene, but it offers up some decent acting and it offers a glimpse into the Hell of Stalingrad the bloodiest battle in the history of known human kind. I would say this movie is more of a psychological war film with an anti-war slant to it. After I viewed this movie I thought to myself a few things; War- what is it good for?, Boy this is one depressing movie and why do I feel guilty?
After watch this movie a few more times I have come to the conclusion that this movie is more about the ""message"" then authenticity. I couldn't help noticing that The uniforms are ALL wrong such as the German tunic. They would first appear to be M36's by the collar but as one sees the whole thing you will see non-pleated pockets as in the m43 tunic. What?? Then the Stahlhelm. They are totally not remotely real to the point of saying WTF!!! The jackboots are wrong. I don't think there was wide spread use of two piece winter camouflage if so it would be rare indeed.

As a film, it plods along sticking to formula with very few surprises or twists.  In fact, the twists are reserved for its historical content, which is comical at best and inexcusable at worst.  A viewing will likely induce an uncomfortable mixture of yawns and laughs.

Like Das Boot, the underlying premise is that of inherently decent frontline grunts, disillusioned with its leaders, who would do humane and wonderful things if only the corrupt powers-that-be would just let them.  Viewers should note that there are numerous first-person accounts by German soldiers, available to anyone that wishes to read them.  I know of none that meshes even remotely with the revisionism in this film.  The scene where the grunts find a massive stash of food and supplies, complete with candlelit tables, reserved for the brass in the heart of Stalingrad is pure fiction.  That is just one example.  But, of course, to portray the German grunts as humane presents complications if the courtesy is not extended to the other side.  So, we have the comical scene where two Russian soldiers fail to fire on armed German soldiers in the heat of battle, leading to their own demise.  Such mercy on the Eastern Front requires a movie director to construct.

the battle of stalingrad was one of the most horrible tragedies in our human history. to those soldiers who died in the bitterest russian cold winter, the only blessing is what the two german soldiers said before frozen to death: 'to die in bitter coldness is good, because you don't feel anything...better than dying in the desert, because it's too hot and you can't stop sweating....the only thing good to die in the desert is....those stars look so close....'

If you have any interest in WW2 and want to see what it was really like on the eastern front in brutal Stalingrad Russia, then this is the movie to see. It feels real and is a complete mightmare, but you can;t take your eyes off the screen. Its like a great novel, with visual intensity. The acting and directing of this German film are top shelf. Its almost like they don't know the cameras are rolling, and it really is 1940's Russia.

It starts off so well for the Germans, as we see them celebrating a rare day off from the horrors of war in Italy. They are fresh off a victory in North Africa and are to be deployed in Russia to take over the vital supply line that Stalingrad affords its Russian forces.

As soon as the fighting begins the horror takes ahold of the German platoon. You can see the looks on their faces scene after scene, when they begin to realize that this is one battle that is not going to be victorious. To further hamper the the grim reality of their surroundings the winter soon takes an icy grip on the unit as well as a beginning hatred for their superior officers. This is one of the interesting aspects of this film. They seem to hate the officers as much as their enemy. And the officers being to lose command and control of the platoon, as they try deperately to intimidate the men to see things ""the fuhrer's way"".

Cold and ominous, this film has the exact feeling you would expect for this battle,  and circumstance. 5 stars - probably the best war film of all time.",1162512000,3,1587,4.297658862876254
836491,5,6304287305,"Compelling story from a ""small cadre of individuals"" perspective.

I have read a fair number of books on Stalingrad and the war in the East,  and have learned beyond question that was where the war was won or lost.  It was in the bottom of the eigth inning when Normandy took place.  Very few educated citizen of modern America have a clue that Germany was about bled out when we entered.  Normandy was about two years off when this epic stuggle took place.  It would be nice to see more recognition in movies or other media that Russia stood essentially alone for years bearing almost the full brunt of the Werhrmacht.

So this is clearly a 5-star movie, but I have a couple of quibbles:

Firstly, that scene at the end where a huge cache of food and supplies hidden for the sole use German higher-ups and somehow uncovered by the little guys is just pure BS!!  Read the first-person accounts!  The survivors to a man report on how their officers suffered along with everybody else.  There are simply no accounts of this stash and I have no idea how it helps the movie other than to make some faux-ironic political point about how little guys are trampled by higher-ups.  Crap.

The other quibble is that by focusing soley on the small cadre thing, you could almost get the impression that this was a small action!!  It is the biggest single battle in human history, certainly in the toll of lives lost.  They focus so much on the drama of these guys that you just can't see the background unless you read a few books.  I don't guess they had the money to re-enact the fight for the railway station, much less the Mamayev Kurgan, but man, there just seems to lack any depth of this incredible mass background for the individual struggles.

The fact is, if you want the full sweeping human drama of Stalingrad you have to READ and read some more.  When it sinks in, you will be staggered, and your personal problems will seem rather trite.

It still gets 5 stars as the merits outweigh these points by such a margin.",1158451200,8,2016,4.473972602739726

836496,4,6304287305,"That was the question Job once asked himself in the Bible.  If Job had been alive and on the eastern front in World War II he may have found the answer to his question - Stalingrad. The hellish battle of Stalingrad, as seen through the eyes of a small band of German soldiers, is the subject of director Joseph Vilsmaier's visually stunning and brutal film Stalingrad.

Stalingrad begins on the Italian coast where a German platoon enjoys leave after the Battle of El Alamein in North Africa.  Recovering from wounds and enjoying wine and German women while sitting along a bright, sunny, beach the men are called to order. A new opportunity for glory awaits them in Russia.  Next stop Stalingrad.  We see the platoon boarding a train and entering a tunnel in Italy and exiting a tunnel into Russia.  We see the platoon's new officer Lt. Witzland writing home to his wife.  A stranger to battle, Witzland writes of the glories to come and of his hopes that he will prove himself to the battle-hardened men under his command.  As we shall see, Witzland does indeed prove himself but not in the manner he could ever have predicted.

Witzland's baptism starts immediately upon disembarkation on the outskirts of Stalingrad. Horrified at the mistreatment of some Red Army prisoners he protests only to find himself knocked into the mud and sneered at by the powers that be.  Word quickly spreads that this callow youth is a ""friend of the Russians"" and only his father's military background saves him.

The platoon is ordered to take a factory and the horror begins. Amidst flame throwers, horrible deaths and raw sewage all thoughts of romantic heroism evaporate and Witzland soon learns that survival is the one and only rational, if hopeless, goal one should take into war.  Witzland's ultimate humanity never deserts him and, contrary to orders, tries to arrange a brief truce so that the Russians and Germans can gather their wounded.  The truce is horribly boggled and the platoon's descent into hell continues in lock step with Stalingrad's descent into a frozen Russian winter. The platoon is arrested for trying to jump the line to get one of their men some medication and they find themselves doing duty as human mine sweepers.

The German army is soon encircled by a Red Army break out and despite the devastation they know is forthcoming the fanatics among them commit even greater horrors. As the men wait for a break through that never comes the excesses of the fanatics continues.  The appearance of the men devolves along with the situation.  The end, the apocalypse that awaits the trapped Germany army is inevitable; only 6,000 men out of more than 250,000 survived the battle or their imprisonment in the USSR. Witzland's final attempt to reclaim his humanity is a stunning one.

The above outline does not do justice to the power of Stalingrad.  Although seen through a German lens that captures no small amount of the humanity of the common German foot soldier, it does not flinch from showing the horrors unleashed in the name of the German people, the Volk, and overseen by a series of true-believers for whom no act of violence is too sadistic or too meaningless.  Portraying the differences between the typical German foot soldier and the S.S. for example is not new.  However, Vilsmaier handles the distinction in an effective and (seemingly) realistic way that neither excuses the behavior nor tries to limit attribution of horrific acts to a small group of less than human soldiers.  Brutality is omnipresent but that brutality renders the flashes of humanity evidenced by the platoon all the more stunning.

Stalingrad is a haunting film and one that will linger long after the final credits run.",1131840000,148,3721,4.863708399366086
836497,5,6304287305,"I am referring to the previous entries which are in my opinion wrongful and incompetent. I think the intention of the director Joseph Vilsmaier was not to show a ""gallant"" and ""heroic"" war movie. If some people miss these gallant and heroic battle scenes during the last 50 minutes then I suggest rather watching Pearl Harbour, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies or any other Hollywood productions with a lacking historic background. Other than the previous author assumed, Stalingrad is no Hollywood but a German production. In my opinion the movie fully fulfils its purpose of an anti war movie and is based on an excellent research in German - Russian history. How can I know that? My Grandfather has been to Stalingrad he didn't want to see the movie because he was frightened that this will bring back all the bad memories. However, my grandfather told me a lot about the experiences he made in Russia and theses stories were neither gallant nor heroic, but cruel and frightening.

To sum it up: If you need some easy entertainments with some heroic good looking soldiers - rather watch Pearl Harbour!",1120003200,24,1100,4.882352941176471

The film is nevertheless remarkable for its unwillingness to explore the complexity of the history of Stalingrad; and its ability to render banal and even annoying the obvious truth that war is nasty. I found the film to be one cliche after another and much of the dialog was embarassing.

The director seems to believe you can avoid creating an exciting narrative, by substituting ""grown men confessing the horror of war."" In the end, the film struck me as self indulgent, not so much honoring history and its victims as using history to massage the pieties of a modern pacifist audience.

As a war buff with a particular fascination with World War II I was excited about the prospect of seeing a German account of the battle for Stalingrad, especially after seeing that this film is from the producers who brought us the outstanding ""Das Boot."" However, I have to say that I was really disappointed with ""Stalingrad."" This film has no business being mentioned in the same sentence as ""Saving Private Ryan"" (though at least ""Stalingrad"" does not cop out and give us a typical Hollywood heroic ending). The story itself was not very well conceived, the action scenes seem contrived and unrealistic, reminding me of war movies from fifty or sixty years ago with their unconvincing death scenes, and the acting left much to be desired. If you're interested in learning more about Stalingrad you would be much better off reading a good book about it. Even ""Enemy at the Gates,"" a movie that disappointed me tremendously, is better than this one. It pains me to say that because I really hoped ""Stalingrad"" would be a more realistic and effective account of this battle than that movie was. Making matters even worse is the ridiculous price of this DVD.

Some of the battlefield effects are a little cheesy and a few things bothered me about the tactics used in the film.  (For example in the film the stormtroopers charged down the streets into machinegun fire.  In the real battle they would advance inside the buildings blasting through walls if necessary.)  The tanks depicted were real soviet tanks but a version T-34/85 that wasn't available until after the battle of Stalingrad.  Inspite of the films shortcomings it was a very entertaining film and I thought it depicted the desperation felt by the men in the surrounded sixth army.  The film works emotionally because it gets you to sympathize with the German soldiers, then worry and suffer with them.  Then you feel hope for them as they try to escape from the surrounded city.  Only to have that hope dashed when they are killed or freeze to death.  This allows you as the viewer to feel a little of what the actual soldiers in the battle felt.

At first i found the dubbing Quite funny, however the plot and charachters soon gave way to that and i was on the edge of my seat watching with my eyes peered.

I think it gave the viewer a great view of what it was like there, however it kept the motive that its still a film and you are able to enjoy it.

There are some very good Battle scenese, including a shootout at the begining, With vicious Action.

I must say its nice to watch a film showing the war from a german point of view, as it is not bias, it really helps you to enjoy it.

The Main reason i found this a very good watch is because It never had that ""patriotic"" and ""propaganda chessy"" feel.

Like 'Saving private ryan', i found the plot to be a joke, however the action in there was good. The action was also good in ""We were soldiers"" however again it had that ""patriotic"" and ""Only war is good for Hollywood (or even USA)"".

The plot in this classic was simply marvelous and the action was much better than others. Very gory scenes suggesting how war was at that epic Battle

I highly recommend this film because it will take you back to WWII, and will make you feel like a miserable, frustraded, and troubled soldier obligated to fight for the ruthless so called ""Fuhrer"".",1095984000,11,586,4.938775510204081
836556,4,6304287305,"This moving German film on the decisive battle of Stalingrad is a stunning portryal of the abysmal defeat Germany's 6th Army suffered at the hands of Soviet forces in 1943. A battle that cost almost 2 million lives and acted as the turning point in WWII.  Released before 'Saving Private Ryan', this film has some of the most visually moving and horrid war scenes I have ever seen.

The film's scenes and plot do an excellent job at portraying how the German army progressed from gleaming confidence to utter dissillusionment and despair in their campaign on the Eastern Front. Overjoyed at the German army's major victories in the Eastern Front, Hitler is convinced the he now has sufficient forces to crush the Red Army and take the oil fields to the South needed to fuel the German war machine while simultaneously cutting off Russia's main fuel supply. Maniacally deluded that victory is certain, Hitler commits the 6th and 4th Armies towards seizing the city.  Under high attrition, the Germans drive the Soviets across the Volga but the arrival of Winter literally freezes any further offensive.  Leaving Winter to faithfully fight the Great Patriotic War for Mother Russia as it did with Napoleon and his Grande Armee in 1812, the Soviets add to the suffering by launching an unexpected counter offensive in which a break is made against the Romanian army leading to a complete envelopment of the city and the 6th Army with the destruction of the 4th Panzer Army.  Trapped, General Paulus is absurdedly promoted by Hitler to the rank of field marshall in hope that he would not break the record of no German field marshall having ever surrendered.  Paulus and the 6th are then ordered to fight to the death and not to yield one meter to the Soviets. Abandoned by Hitler and any hope of relief, the 6th Army deteriorates into a motley of starving and frostbitten soldiers defending themselves mostly with booby traps and snipers while scavaging for scraps. Discarded as traitors by Hitler and told to fight to the end, the 6th Army that had started with over 190,000 men was reduced to only 90,000 soldiers who surrendered in January 1943: only 6000 of them returned alive from brutal Soviet captivity to tell their tale after the war. The film focuses on the lives and characters of a platoon and their experiences. Full of hope, pride, and arrogance as they leave Italy in the beginning, the audience sees the characters deteriorate into little more than frightened animals seeking safety from the wrath of the enemy and the unforgiving winter conditions. The movie has some distortions as to the common perceptions held by German soldiers as to their role in the Third Reich's army but this is to emphasize the issue of conscience, to present the characters as sympathetic, and to create plot tension. As is typical with many WWII movies, there is the stereotypical amoral Nazi hardline party member to act as a counterpoint. These narrative/cinematic techniques are not too obtrusive in this film though and don't erode the impact of the movie. This movie is far better than 'Enemy At The Gates' which covers the same battle. It's not innundated with cliche dialogue and stereotypical Hollywood portrayals of Soviets or Germans. The closing scene has to be the grimmest ending I have seen in any war film.

The film remains a sober drama and brings the full impact as to the horrible conditions German and Soviet soldiers fought under in that fateful battle that would be the turning point of WWII giving the initiative to the Allies for counter-offensive maneuvers. As with Napoleon's defeat to Tsar Alexander I, the German defeat at Stalingrad stands as one of the greatest catastrophic defeats suffered in military history.  In terms of the cost of lives and human suffering, it is probably the worst of any in history along with the fall of Leningrad.  So intensive was this battle that certain parts of the city never saw snow due to the massive artillery barrage launched by the soviets in the confined sector of the surrounded 6th Army.  So horrid was the winter that even oil would freeze rendering firearms, artillery, and motor parts useless after prolonged exposure.  So desperate were all involved that many were forced to cannibalism for survival.  This movie portrays these morbid and pitiful conditions in perfect detail.  This is definitely not a movie for children or the faint of heart but I strongly recommend this moving and realistic drama for those reasons.",1090886400,15,4489,4.898550724637682
836557,2,6304287305,"""Stalingrad"" is the most depressing film I've ever seen. Mind you, I didn't think a story about the death of 260,000 German soldiers would be as uplifting as, say, ""The Sound of Music"" but this movie pulls out all the stops in an effort to leave the viewer a quivering, glassy-eyed emotional pulp.
Made by the same producers who gave us the seminal ""Das Boot"" I found it not in that league. The film is overlong, sterotypical, and spends too much time cramming postwar German conscience pangs down the viewer's throat. Moreover, the last hour or so reminds me of those interminable scenes from ""Born on the Fourth of July"" that seem more interested in punishing the audience than advancing the story. The battle for, and siege of, Stalingrad, was no doubt an experience of horror and misery beyond the power of words or images to describe it, but what I was hoping for here was a German version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" -- high on combat and confusion, short on moralizing. Unfortunately, all postwar German cinema is filtered through the same revisionist political opinions; this explains why all German war movies inevitably leave you with the feeling like you've been punched in the stomach or clubbed over the head. After about an hour I was hoisting my own flag of surrender; but the pummeling continued.
The scene at the airfield, for example, when the wounded men are trying desperately to get out on the last transports, is very hard to watch. From what I've read, however, it seems that discipline in the Stalingrad pocket was maintained until the bitter end, and the airfield scene may more resemble how the producers of the film wanted history to unfold rather than the actual way it did. In fact, the 90,000 men who lived to surrender (all but 5,000 of whom died in captivity) did so only when they were completely out of fuel, medicine, and ammunition, and had no other means to resist; but the producers, of course, permit to trace of pride in military accomplishment to enter into their film.
Most American movies and television portray the Germans in World War II as heel-clicking cartoon idiots (""I know nutink! Nutink!""). Most German war movies portray the Germans as either villainous martinet Nazis, or cynical disbelievers who carry arms only for Germany and not for Hitler or the Party. In fact, the record shows that the Germans overwhelmingly trusted Hitler and were deeply inspired by his ideology. It is this fact, and not what was done in the name of National Socialism, that seems to sit very hard in the modern German stomach.",1088121600,29,2555,4.782805429864253

Why not include the original soundtrack. Surely this was available.
One of the best parts of the film, a scene showing the platoon listening to a speech by Hitler (the actual recording) over an improvised radio, also has no subtitles! So good luck to anyone who would have been interested in knowing what the speech was about.

I like many other reviewer's here have seen the endless stream of documentories about stalingrad and have heard the accounts from veteran's of the battle and about the horror and suffering that wen't on, but I feel that the word's and tear's from these veteran's never quite sunk in. After seeing this movie I feel like the pain that was depicted has allowed the words of these veteran's to finnally sink in and I have a new understanding of just what these men had endured...and yet I feel like I still don't know the whole truth.

Of all his works Stalingrad stands out as on of those films that are enjoyable to watch if u are into ""realistic war movies"" (realistic compared to hollywood) but which fall short when it comes to story telling and depth of the subject.
Vilsmaier has proven to be pretty superficial and painfully politically correct with his latter work ""Comedian Harmonists"", a film that is also just a shadow of what it could have been.
Fact is that what we see in ""Stalingrad"" is technically well done considering it's year of release, but does NOT portray the average German soldier on the Eastern front.
What is sickening is the ""self hatred"" of the Landser shown in this film. Which soldier who is right in his mind admits that ""he is a beast trampling on Russian soil"" and then cintinues to fight ???? Even more, which soldier who is right in his mind admits that he hates the Nazi regime but continues to fight with all he has got ????
Fact is that many German soldiers simply belived that what they were fighting for was a just cause. Either blinded by propaganda, driven by feelings of revenge or simply naive obedience, no army would have continued to fight so viciously against incredible odds if it was full of ""self haters"".
Fact is that nobody wants to portray ""heroes"" of a story who obviously are fighting for a bad cause but do not realize it and therefore give it all they got.
Something the numerous Vietnam War films out there tried to do and ended up portraying Nam Vets as drug abusing psycho maniacs and mental wrecks, a trend heavily criticized by vet organizations. The same idiotic trend applies to German soldiers in GERMAN war flicks.
No , the ""good guys"" are so morally ""good"" that they preemptively admit their guilt, whereas the copy book nazi officers try one more time to win the ""who looks like the Gestapo guy from Raiders of teh Lost Arch""-contest.

This element was quite a surprising fall from the fairly carefully rendered combat sequences that reviewers describe.",1071705600,,440,4.714285714285714
836593,5,6304287305,"There are few movies around which really deal with war on the Eastern front during WW2, of those which I have seen this is definitley the best.
We follow a group of soldiers through the hell of the battle that was Stalingrad through this very nicely shot film, which really smacks you in the face with the horror of war. One scene which really reached out and grabbed me was Pitomnik Airfield, where we see the mad and desperate frenzy of wounded and dying soldiers trying to get aboard one of the planes, their only hope of salvation from the Kessel. It was exactly how I imagined it while reading Stalingrad by Antony Beevor.
This movie also closes with one of the most desolate and dark scenes ever I think, the remnants of the group having failed at their miserable attempt to escape the Kessel, sitting and freezing in the open Steppe, just waiting to die.
Simply harrowing stuff and I highly recommend this to all.",1069286400,2,920,4.548192771084337
836594,4,6304287305,"I find Stalingrad highly recommendable to anyone interested in a battle that has - with some justification - been regarded as the psychological turning point in a war of attrition between two dictatorships.
Having an army background (military infantry officer) myself, I found great pleasure in watching an infantry platoon ""at work"" (if you pardon the expression), instead of following a larger unit abstractly. The platoon level provides an excellent opportunity to comprehend life and interaction in a small unit literally under fire. Which the platoon in question certainly is.
In ""Stalingrad"", I very much appreciated the dramatic way in which the platoon's different phases were described: The relaxation inbetween battles in Italy; the gathering of the battalion and its subsequent departure for Russia; the journey through Russia; the arrival in Stalingrad; the first encounter; the mounting casualties; the conflict between the men on the ground and certain superiors; the uncertainty; the battle fatigue; the chaos; and the ubiquitous and inevitable death.
The actors are splendid, their conversations frank and spontaneous.
However, the reason for only suggesting 4 out of 5 stars is the political correctness inherent in ""Stalingrad"". On several occasions (for example, during the battle break in the city when both parties send out people to get their wounded, and in the conversations between the platoon leader and the Russo-German woman-prisoner) we are reminded of how unjust the war was, how badly the Germans behaved in Russia and how innocent the attacked Russian were. These incidents are, to be honest, rather pathetic, but luckily not to an extent that completely ruins the general impression of ""Stalingrad"".
No doubt - the Wehrmacht did indisputedly commit atrocities in the Soviet Union during WW II. But I would have liked the movie to mention the Soviet atrocities as well, both against German troops as well as ITS OWN civilian population. The movie seems to portray the Soviet Union as the innocent victim of German aggression, which it was clearly not: WW II started mainly because Britain declared war on Germany after the attack of the latter on Poland 01 September 1939. But for some ""strange"" reason, Britain forgot all about declaring war on the Soviets, although the Soviets attacked Poland from the east following the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty.
Germany lost the war, and its conquerors quickly imposed on it a feeling of guilt that may have seemed partly justified in 1945, but which still - as can be seen in ""Stalingrad"" - haunts movie-making in Germany.
Let me emphasise that the aforementioned political correctness in no way makes the movie bad - but its omission would undoubtedly have motivated the undersigned to suggest all five stars instead of four.
If you liked Das Boot, you will surely like Stalingrad too. I blame neither author nor director of Stalingrad for the political correctness; that ghost is still too firmly rooted in German psyche to be forgotten and omitted in movies about the controversial phase of European history from 1939 to 1945.",1065571200,62,3101,5.228915662650603
836595,5,6304287305,"While the review is good, I might just point out one minor but significant error, which actually makes the film bear worse on the Heer (Army).
The soldier beating the Russian POW was NOT Waffen-SS. He did not wear W-SS markings (black insignia etc). He was in fact a member of the FeldPolizei or military police, who managed the rear areas.
Therefore he was a member of the Army, and not the SS. There were no SS units anywhere near Stalingrad, except for SS-Wiking division 500 miles to the south. The W-SS at this stage were not numerous enough to be ubiquitous (and never were).
The act in the film shows the Heer to be deeply implicated in the mistreatment of the populace and prisoners. For those wishing to be shocked, read Omer Bartov's book on the barbarisation of the German Army in the East.
The film demonstrates how deeply isolated an oficer from a backround like Von Witzland's could be. Many officers closed their eyes or privately lamented the excesses of the troops, their fellow officers and their superiors. The Russian's fought as hard as they did, not just out of fear of the regime, but because the whole bent of the German war-effort in the east was genocidal.",1065398400,3,1182,4.633333333333334
836596,4,6304287305,"I'd heard about this film a few years ago, so I picked it up and watched it with my two boys.
It was interesting to see WWII from the German side of things, especially their view of the Russian Front, an idiom all-too-often imagined by us Americans, rather than seen or experienced.
*Stalingrad* follows a German lieutenant and his squad from their R&R in Italy to their ultimate deployment in the longest, largest and most costly battle of the war.  The other recent film about this battle, *Enemy at the Gate* is a slicker production with a bigger budget and recognizable stars.  But it catches only brief glimpses of the situation's intractable desperation.  *Stalingrad* packs more emotion and spirit, its protagonists more real, more flesh and blood than *EATG*.  There is no romantic subplot to distract from the Germans' struggle against their two inevitable foes---the Russian soldier and the Russian winter.
As they change from an elite and well-equipped Storm Trooper unit to becoming a rag-tag band of starving deserters, they  search for a safe haven in a world where everything else is the enemy.
The squad unsuccessfully grapples with contradiction while Humanity takes a backseat to the German War Machine.  One message is made clear:  the German soldiers possess far more compassion than the Nazis.
*Stalingrad* has lots of blood and guts a la *Saving Private Ryan*. Although Stalingrad's battle-gore FX are far less realistic than those employed by SPR, it's not for the squeamish viewer.
My sons and I were emotionally affected by this film.  We saw how War is not always fought on bright summer days and is not as glorious a pursuit as we may have imagined.  But most of all we learned that our enemies aren't all Nazis or zealots or villains.  The poor fellows freezing in the trenches are human beings just like us.",1062460800,11,1836,4.893548387096774
836597,3,6304287305,"About the only complaints I had concerning the movie itself dealt with a couple battle scenes that seemed... rushed.  As they occur early enough in the movie where they should be getting you hooked (they are the first ones IN Stalingrad), I could see how someone not interested in the subject matter to begin with might lose interest.
The plot is good, engaging; and gets you to sympathize with the protagonists without raising the propaganda flag.  There are some moments that seem staged, but on the other hand you also get to see how some evil people can do enough bad to wash over their comrades' more valiant deeds (on either side).  I kind of wish there was a little more information given to the watcher as to the progression of the battle...  You basically find out they're encircled, and then, near the end, you get to see Paulus and the rest march into captivity, with the doomed general chastising one of the protagonists (who does not know anything more than we do) about still carrying a weapon.  In a way, the lack of that plot device serves to keep your focus on the doomed ""heroes""... and I suppose it tries to show you what it's like to be in the midst of all that chaos and violence without knowing if it's even worth it anymore.
As far as the DVD goes...  I may as well have been watching it on VHS.  The picture quality is nothing to brag about, and I'm too used to getting at least Dolby 5.1 on DVD format.  Plain old stereo doesn't do jack to justify a DVD format, and a war movie without volume lacks.  There are no special features other than ""English or German"" and ""Subtitle"" menus, which is rather unfortunate, considering the amount of side information one could offer on such a huge event in history.",1057190400,7,1729,4.480891719745223
836638,5,6304287305,"It seems to me that so-called ""Anti-war"" movies make the best accounts of warfare and ""Stalingrad"" is no exception.  This acclaimed anti-war film delivers solid acting and characters with depth, excluding the two-dimension Military Police Captain, who fulfills the obligatory role of as the film's token ""true Nazi"" (there had to be at least one!).  Aside from that, I'm hard-pressed to name another movie that portrays the German soldier in World War II with such historical accuracy and objective portrayal.  Military history buffs will appreciate the attention given to uniforms and the correct organization of the unit in the film as an Engineer battalion with an attached Feldgendarmerie company. (Though in the English version, the translators botched this, choosing to translate ""Sturmpioniere"" to the politically pejorative ""Stormtroopers"" rather than the more accurate ""Assault Engineers"") Real Russian T34s, magnetic anti-tank mines, a PAK 40 and a host of other authentic equipment make the setting for the tale believable.
But the movie is more than an active display of 1942 militaria. It is an intensely human tale of person within the soldier.  For me, the film was strongly reminiscent of Guy Sajer's ""Forgotten Soldier"", particularly in capturing the deadly misery of the Russian winter and the daily lot of the common soldier.  ""Stalingrad"" will be of interest to military viewers for leader professional development training.  In particular, the film is solid precursor to values training and discussions of the boundaries of duty, selfless sacrifice, and loyalty.
I am extremely pleased to add this film in my collection and thank you for the opportunity to recommend it further.",1056240000,,1699,5.392452830188679

Stalingrad does so with exceptional cinematography and casting, focusing on a new Wehrmacht (Heer) Lieutentant's first experience at the front, and his interactions with his Captain, Sergeant, Corporal, and Privates.  If you have heard of and imagined what the ""Ostfront"" or ""Eastern Front"" might have been like, this is the movie to see.  It puts the carnage of our own recent films of the U.S. Civil War, senselessly bloody attempts to ""take"" terrain, or in this case, a city, building by building, in another context.  It puts to you directly the eternal question:  why war?  I cannot answer the question, we know why German territorial expansion became World War Two.  But to those involved in the expansion, what did it really mean?  As one soldier comments from the train taking them from sunny Italy to Stalingrad, ""Adolf is going to build me a highway out here.""  There will be land enough for all...remember Manifest Destiny?  Who were the ""Untermenschen"" (literally, lower people).  Slavs?  Russians?  Lakota Sioux?  A thoughtful immersion in the themes of the film Stalingrad will open your mind to other questions, questions that have been asked and unanswered on every populated continent or sector on Earth.  Can we learn something here that will avert repetition elsewhere, as we may be destined to go?  Hopefully, that answer is yes.  Lincoln is remembered as once saying, ""G-d must have loved the common man, he made so many of them.""  Many different uniforms have been worn, but are the wearers the same?  At one excecution scene in Stalingrad, a soldier comments--this is so we remember which side we're on.  That is because it is so easy to forget....",1048032000,7,1801,4.94

What I'll say is this movie does not strip any of the characters of their humanity.  The viewer begins to have more contempt for the circumstances than any of the characters.

836641,4,6304287305,"The production team of ""Das Boot"" (Dir. Wolfgang Petersen, 1981; Dir. cut, 1997) again paints a human face on Hitler's war machine with this gut retching film: Stalingrad. The film follows a platoon of German ""Stormtroopers"" from a comfortable R & R on the Mediterranean to the horrors of the Russian front. The result is an anti-war message every bit as powerful as All Quiet on the Western Front. The film's protagonist is a young lieutenant (Thomas Kretschmann) sent to replace the former platoon officer who was wounded in action. He is not a die-hard Nazi, however, initially he is full of discipline and military bearing. As in other films of this genre, the young officer soon finds that military protocol as well as gentlemanly rules of war do not apply in combat, particularly on the Russian front. After the first major battle for the tractor factory, the story begins to focus on the ever dwindling platoon. The nucleus of which consists of the Lieutenant, Fritz (Dominique Horwitz), the sergeant (Joachim Nickel), and a raw recruit Gege (Sabastian Rudolph). The group soon finds themselves fighting both the enemy and an officer corp bent on carrying out Hitler's futile orders at any cost. The latter is exemplified in a corrupt Captain (Karl Hermanck) who acts as the film's villain. The main theme of the film is survival. Unlike Das Boot, there is no sense of daring adventure among the platoon, only hopes of returning to Germany alive. The battle scenes are exciting and realistic. The scene where six authentic Russian T-34 tanks attack the dug-in platoon on a frozen steppe is well done, although the film makers included far too few Russian infantry for protection. There is enough severed limbs and blood on the snow to add realism. One gruesome scene in particular during the tank attack, a German soldier accidentally runs in the path of an anti-tank round and is completely cut in two. He lives long enough to view the lower half of his body lying next to his bloody torso.  After the Germans are completely surrounded and cut off from all food and supplies, the last remaining four survivors realize they are doomed to either languish in Siberia or die. They decide, with the help of a female Russian soldier to escape the encirclement themselves. The ending will surprise those who have been drawn to the last four members of the platoon. The film achieves its aim of showing how political ideology is absent from the battlefield. One has to almost be reminded that the cannon fodder at Stalingrad represented two totalitarian regimes that condoned terror and murder on an unprecedented scale. Originally in German with English subtitles, the DVD offers an English dub that is not distracting.

836645,5,6304287305,"I have read many reviews extremely critical of this movie. Some are warranted, many are not. One complaint is no depiction of Tiger tanks, which is a ludicrous one, considering the tank was not seen on the Eastern Front until the following summer!
Another complaint is about a German 37mm anti-tank gun knocking out Soviet Tanks. Another false one, considering the 37mm had no muzzle brake as depicted in the movie. It looks very much like a Pak36r or Pak40 75mm gun, which was very much capable of taking out Soviet 1942 T-34 Tanks. Be sure of your facts, before complaining. This movie is one of the best for authentic equipment. If you want to see fake, take a closer look at the Tiger tanks in Saving Private Ryan. Their suspension is far from WWII German.
Others complain of the lack of realism in the battle scenes. Who knows of battle realism? It is unfair to compare the effects with movies that were made ten years later. Today's movies simply have a greater technology to work with.
My biggest concern is viewing this movie with an American arrogance and bias. Not all good movies are ""Made In America"". Sure this movie has it's faults, but don't all? Remember to be fairly honest in a review, we must try to view it for the culture it was intended. Just because you don't ""get it"" doesn't mean it was cheesy.

836687,4,6304287305,"A gut wrenching depiction of the German army's defeat at Stalingrad. The film focuses on an elite unit of German strom troops. It starts with the unit on R&R in Italy. Ten minutes into the film the unit has suffered 90 percent casualties and their plight goes down hill from there.
There are numerous scenes that portray the brutality of that particular battle, and by inference all of the war on the eastern front. As in Das Boot, all pretense of glory and honor is blown away. The scene where the protagonist, formerly an idealist , fakes injury in order to be medially evacuated really hits hard. The film seems to lose its way after that.
The scenes with the well supplied officer and his captured love slave (who is the same gal the protagonist encountered earlier in the sewers) really goes overboard.
The film makes no apologies and offers no rationalization.  This is a common theme of blaming the insanity of combat on the officers, but in this case it rings false. The wehrmacht captain who floats in and out of the story is probably more realistically portrayed. His line that ""he owed us that"" after one of his soldiers is sacrificed for marginal gain reflects a grim pragmatism that the wehrmacht faced as they experienced defeat upon defeat.

The battle scenes are extremely well done and accurate, and this is years before Saving Private Ryan. The movie focuses on the German side of the battle, so the horrible conditions also experienced by the Soviet army are not portrayed much, which if this movie has a major failing is its only major failing. It would have been even more amazing had the film focused on both sides of the battle.
In addition to the superb battle scenes, the movie also takes on the horrible war crimes comitted by the German army such as shooting civilians and looting and burning their homes. The fact that it is a German film makes this accurate portrayal even more important.
The anti-war moralizing scenes also at times grow weary. In reality, the vast majority of historical studies, such as those done by Omer Bartov, suggest most German soldiers on the Eastern front believed in their Nazi inspired cause and used as much propaganda as they could to reinforce this belief throughout the war.

However, after inital viewing, I realized that ""Stalingrad"" is not in the same league as ""Enemy..."" from a critical perspective.
""Stalingrad"" is simply a foreign ""B"" movie, where ""Enemy..."" is a top notch Hollywood blockbuster.
Even most of the combat scenes in ""Stalingrad"" are disappointing.
Like the instance when GG ""accidently"" shoots his comrade inside the factory? Veteran Wehrmacht Stormtroopers couldn't be that stupid! Ah, but of course the filmakers want to teach us a lesson...
And later in the film, the attacking platoon of Soviet tanks and infantry should have completely routed the German ""homeboy"" platoon hastily dug in the frozen Russian steppe (with only one 37mm anti-tank gun!).
Instead the ill-equiped Germans destroy every single T-34 tank and enemy soldier. Oh, it probally isn't time for all the German characters in the movie to die miserably just yet...
And thereafter until the movie's end, not another ""Ivan"" platoon or even soldier is shown. What happened to the 3 Soviet Armies that encircled the city? Disappeared due to a low budget, I guess.
""Stalingrad"" is missing the good drama that an essential war film should have.
Instead, I think this movie was produced with the main intent to help erase facist political problems which still plague the German people.

836690,5,6304287305,"This movie does not hold much back.  Perhaps not as graphic as ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"", it is more pyschologically disturbing.  This is not an uplifting movie, but then again something set in Stalingrad is not suppose to be!  The equipment and uniforms are all accurate, as befitting the producers of Das Boot.  The storyline is pretty basic, a series of horrondus sequences as we watch the slow death of the German 6th army.  I found keeping track of the various German actors a little difficult as they all looked pretty much the same after a while, especially after the wear and tear of battle.  The end scene in the Bunker with the captured Russian female who speaks German was a bit contrieved, but it does add extra irony and poigancy to an already harsh film.
No doubt the older Italian movie ""Attack and Retreat"" served as a partial inspiration.  The more recent ""Enemy at the Gates"" provides more of a storyline and romance than this movie, and makes for an interesting contrast.
For sheer rawness and power Stalingrad has a lot going for it, and while not as graphic as ""Ryan"", it does not pretend to have any uplifting message.  In fact the Germans show that they can be pretty brutal in depicting themselves during a sad and debased period in their history.

Normal men, struggling for a cause they believed in. It understandably had to limit the portrayal of the battle to certain characters and their actions to get across its message.  Survivors of Stalingrad considered ""der Furher"" as their ""gravedigger.""  This movie puts across a point - and it isn't heavy handed.  The human element is the only criterion in war that matters.  The disillusionment potrayed by the characters is totally in keeping with reality.  There are excellent action sequences.  The lack of German armor in the movie is understandable, because there aren't that many Panzers extant.  If some of the anti-Nazi messages seem heavy handed, you must remember, that these senitments were, in reality, much harsher in the minds of the 6th Army Germans than what was portrayed in the film, and they were portaryed as skillfully as possible within the time limits a two hour film is constrained to work under.  The harsh reality of combat is shown - years before ""Saving Private Ryan,"" with clarity and skill. If the musical score seem ""weak,"" as some viewers suppose - you must remember, it intentionally undermines the ""glory"" of the conquest these soldiers were to undertake.  It is an intensely human drama, and it is nice to see characters portrayed who actually tried to do something about their hopeless situation.  The end alone spells it all out - two soldiers, in the depths of the frozen waste, their only remaining humanity their love for one another, as the cold consumes them and kills them.  If you want a movie that shows great slaughter and a romanticized, ""Hollywood"" version of war, go elewhere.  IF you want a movie that shows the ambivalence of war, the soul-destroying circumstances faced by the German Landser, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better film.

836694,2,6304287305,"The battle of Stalingrad is usually seen as the decisive battle of World War II which led to the defeat of the conservative alliance which was led by Nazi Germany. What happened was that after the defeat of the Soviet Offensive around Kharkov German forces advanced deep into Soviet Territory towards the important rail junction of Stalingrad. The aim of the German offensive was to cut off the industrial sections of the Soviet Union from its sources of petroleum in the Caucus.
The problem was that the German forces were poorly supplied and poorly supported by inadequately equipped Romanian armies.  The Soviets were able to initially holt the German advance at Stalingrand and to then destroy the supporting armies trapping the German Sixth Army in a pocket. The Germans had no strategic reserve and had to withdraw their forces in the south leaving the sixth army to be captured. The German Sixth Army held on for some time in appalling conditions. Huge numbers of soldiers succumbed to starvation and to the cold.
This film is about the battle of Stalingrad. It tells the story from the point of view of a small number of soldiers trapped in the pocket.
The difficulty of making a film about the battle from the German point of view is what do you say. In years gone by the approach of Germans to their history was to suggest that the evils of the Nazi regime were limited to the SS and to organs of the ruling party. The army by comparison had performed in a brilliant way and maintained its honour. It is clear now days that in fact the German Army was involved in a range of brutal crimes against the general Russian population.
This film tries to sidestep the historical issues by concentrating on a group of soldiers at a low level. They are mildly rebellious and one of them loses a combat decoration for insubordination. The main characters are shown to have served with the Africa Korps and are transferred in the beginning of the film to the Russian front. The film charts the early optimism of the Stalingrad campaign and shows how after the Soviet winter offensive the position of the Germans grew more and more desperate.
The technique of the film maker is to suggest that the characters are basically decent. This is shown by their kindness towards Russian captives and civilians. The exist in a world in which the villains are the officer Corp and the leaders.  The film is a tragedy in which the common soldiers try firstly to survive and then to escape. In the end they fail and become some of the countless casualties of battle.
The film is reasonably easy to watch but it fails really to deal with the subject in a reasonable way. It is not an action adventure film and it is not a very realistic film either.",1014768000,7,2734,4.6234567901234565
836695,3,6304287305,"When STALINGRAD was released in Germany in 1992 it was accompanied by a flood of books, magazines and modeling kits in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad.  As with most German-made World War Two movies, this film focuses on the honorable actions of a small infantry unit rather than the Reich's broader political-stragetic designs.  The film opens with a battalion of hardened infantrymen transfering from the relative comfort of Italy to the savage reality of the Steppes.  From that point the focus narrows to a handful of German soldiers attempting to survive in world gone mad.  Despite the German 6th Army's setback at Stalingrad, the German command continues to believe in its invincibility with resulting detrimental effect on the soldiers.
In terms of hardware the film assembled an impressive list of museum pieces including T-34 tanks, Czech-built Hanomag halftracks and a Junkers Ju-52 aircraft for the production.  Indeed, the Ju-52 retained its winter camouflage after the filming and made the rounds at air shows.
STALINGRAD does not have much in the way of an impressive soundtrack.  Additionally the film drifts from its subject matter to a melancholy ending in the snow.  STALINGRAD did not do very well in its limited US big screen release.  The widescreen DVD is an improvement over the VHS tape.  As other reviewers have recommended, it is best to see the film in German with English subtitles, though the subtitles leave out quite a bit of the dialogue.
Overall this film ranks highly with other war films.  A viewer must take into account that this film was originally produced for a European audience.  Traditionally foreign war films lack a distinct hero and happy endings are rare.",1013990400,42,1729,5.052816901408451

There is basically no plot and the historical content (how the battle unfolds) is not a focus at all. It's all about following a bunch of German soldiers trying to survive. Even this could be Ok, if only the acting was not so BAD.

The German soldiers were starving and filthy by the time of the surrender in 1943 - these guys had a few days growth on their faces and looked pretty healthy.  The Lt that was always making a general nuisance of himself was unbelievable, and his role smacked of revisionism.  The final scenes were completely unbelievable - desertion; trying to get on the last plane out etc.  I guess I was expecting the same quality as Das Boot.",1013904000,4,582,4.601941747572815
836728,5,6304287305,"I liked this movie from the very start. Not only does it give the viewer an eye-opener into how ordinary German soldiers thought (not all or even most Germans were Nazi fanatics and anti-Semite but Hollywood doesn't know or care) but it offers something different from typical American propaganda. The combat scenes are as powerful as the opening of Saving Private Ryan (a good movie until the end, when the heroic Yanks defeat the evil Krauts) but we know that it will all be a waste and for nothing, and what's worse, Hitler or the senior officers don't even care (neither do American leaders, but they keep a lid on that kind of stuff).
I don't need to say much about the film itself (there are other reviews for that) but I will say that this film does an excellent job at showing how the fighting at Stalingrad was, and how the German army struggled to gain Hitler his Lebensraum. It displays the character's slow realization that their cause is lost and their reaction, which would happen to just about any soldier in any army (yes, even the Waffen-SS, uh, the U.S. Marines).
All in all, an excellent movie.",1010188800,24,1113,4.597989949748744

Depicting the every day struggles of ordinary soldiers on the front lines of Hitler's masssive offensive, Stalingrad offers a viewpoint that is both action packed and brutally sobering.  Visually wonderful and frighteningly realistic, it tells the tale of the utter hopelessness of the German army in 1943.

The movie does contain some stereotypes(evil nazi leaders), but one have to bear in mind that the men have been sent to this particular unit as a disciplinary act; followingly, they would be treated like scum even by their own.

836731,4,6304287305,"Gemany's invasion of Russia was one of the most significant events of WWII.  The number of Russian lives lost, many civilian, was astounding.  The film Stalingrad focuses on the war through the eyes of the young German ""frontliners"", showing the many complications of all out war- the fear, the confusion, the hate, the mutiny, the effects of mother nature, just to name some.  the film is also bent on pointing out the fact that many soldiers were not sold on the cause- they just wanted to get out alive.
The scenes in Stalingrad that really stick in my mind are the depictions of the ""war in the snow"" that took such a toll on both sides.  This is an aspect of war that is often overlooked, but the climate and landscape of any area can often decide the outcome of many battles, if not the war.  Platoon, The Thin Red Line, and Stalingrad all do an excellent job of recreating these wartime environments.
Make no mistake, Stalingrad is a film that is very anti-war.  It serves as the kind of deturrent that I wish everyone would take notice of.  Young men, often with families left behind, putting their lives on the line for an unworthy cause- they are killing men that they have never met- men that also have families at home- all in the name of their country. And that is the beauty of Stalingrad (yes I see the oxymoron).
The one thing that bothered me about Stalingrad was that it mostly overlooks the worst part of the war- the mass civilian casualties suffered by the Russians at the hands of the Germans. Other than that, I don't have mavy gripes with this film.  If you like war movies, I suggest you check this one out.",1009152000,4,1632,4.4713804713804715

What little comic relief that exists is in the first 15 minutes of the film; after that, it only gets darker and darker and darker. Very different from Das Boot.

836776,5,6304287305,"I'm an amateur WW2 historian, so this movie was a must see for me.  I have always been fascinated by the battle of Stalingrad, and have always been disappointed by the dearth of movies on the subject.  This offering not only gives a truly graphic view of the battle, but carries with it a somber message.  No happy ending here.

The story centers on a company of German assault engineers who have been fighting in North Africa.  After a furlough on the Mediterranean coast, they are redeployed to fight Russians on the eastern front, and find themselves thrust into the battle of Stalingrad.  Even as seasoned veterans, they are unprepared for the horror that awaits them.

The protagonist is an idealistic young lieutenant seeking to earn the respect of his men.  His introduction to the realities of Stalingrad is abrupt and harsh, and only goes downhill after the initial encounter.

The first half of the movie focuses on the factory fighting which so exemplified the larger battle.  The scenes are gruesome and unspeakably violent, and so provide a glimpse into the brutality that was Stalingrad.  The latter half of the movie deals with events following the Russian encirclement of November, 1942, and is truly a study in abject human misery.

I will not give away the ending for those who haven't seen it.  I will say, though, that the emotional toll of this movie is akin to ""Schindler's List.""  I first saw this on the big screen with a friend, and we both walked out of the theater in a slack-jawed daze.  This is NOT your standard war movie, but it's definitely a great one.",1000944000,21,1585,4.712727272727273
836777,5,6304287305,"Stalingrad precedes Saving Private Ryan as a visceral look at the horrors of war. Besieged by the Germans for months, the bitterly contested city looks appropriately as if it's been hit by an atomic bomb. The film relates not only how hard both the Germans and Russians fought over this city, but how the cruel Russian Winter exacerbated the situation and made the Germans' attempt futile.
The acting is very good in this film. We aren't meant to be sympathetic to the German soldiers. They are merely cogs in the Nazi war machine. Fallible characters who show both courage and cowardice in the process of the story. I found that it was best to watch the movie in its native German with English subtitles. You get a better feel for the emotional content of the words that are spoken, even if you are not fluent in the language.
The production values are excellent, as are the sets and costumes. This film, to my knowledge, is thoroughly convincing and makes you feel as if you've been drawn into the era to witness the terrible battle as it nears its conclusion. At the end, we see the beginnings of the terrible march to Siberia by German prisoners. Only five percent survived, but I'm sure the Russians would have been satisfied had none of them made the trip.
The only thing I might have wanted to see was a bit more of the perspective of the Russian troops, but I guess that might have made a long film a bit too long.

The psychological disintegration of the men rang true.  What was missing for me was that one element- the heroism of the Russian people. The people of Stalingrad were trapped. They fought the Nazis knowing that there was no escape from death. They faced Nazi bullets knowing the Red Army stood ready to execute them if they broke under fire, or failed to attack.

I say this in the sense of being an anti-war movie, by portraying the events on a human level such as 'The Thin Red Line'.  The suffering and agony of the 6th army in that fateful winter of 1942 is portrayed here with nothing left to the imagination.  I must say that I find it sad that some of the other reviewers can see history in such a black and white perspective - Oh my gosh can there really be Germans that weren't evil!  (By the way in reference to another review there were no Tiger tanks at this stage of the war.  They were introduced at the counter attack at Kharkov)  In wars of this kind of scale and magnitude there are no winners.  Personally I was shocked after viewing it for the first time, but I felt relieved to see this kind of movie instead of another Hollywood how America won the war glorification.  Thank goodness for a movie that finally depicts life on the eastern front and doesn't kiss arse to the supposed moral police.  After all the war in Europe was won and lost on the easter front.

His characters are all starving, tired, and hopeless man forced to fight in a war that they don't understand because their leaders told them to. Along with ""Saving private Ryan"" and ""The thin red line"" Stalingrad shows in a very clear way all the savagery, brutality and lack of sense that comes with war. It's characters are very human and tragic, especially Lieutenant von Witzland that after seeing the bloodbath war really is has his beliefs about honor, obedience and loyalty as an officer unmercifuly shattered . Far way from being the nazi propaganda supermen, the german in Stalingrad were all desperate and frightened man fighting not only the russians but also the terrible winter, starvation, madness and day-to-day fear.

Regardless of one's ideology, one can't help but feel some sympathy for the ill-fated men of the Sixth Army. Not only did these men have to fight the tenacious Russian soldiers but they also had to fight fear, lonliness and depravation. Director Joseph Vilsmaier does a good job of bringing the viewer into the hell that these men had to endure.
The film focuses on three main characters: Sgt. Manfred ""Rollo"" Rohleder, Corporal Fritz Reiser and Lieutenant Hans von Witzland. Though Rollo and Reiser are experienced combat veterans, both are stunned by the sight of the wounded and dying soldiers on the train platform just outside of Stalingrad. For Rollo and Reiser, this is a harbinger of things to come.
Lieutenant von Witzland is a young, inexperienced officer who feels he must prove himself to win the respect of his men. However, his ideals and aspirations are soon shattered by the brutality and horror of combat. Eventually, von Witzalnd realizes that this is a lost cause and he openly declares that he no longer feels bound by his oath as an officer.

Yeah, the film: Apparently, this movie marks a return to the ""good old days"" of post-war German film-making (the 50s), when the role of the German ""Wehrmacht"" in the war was down-played; essentially, our boys were just naive but otherwise honorable tools in the hands of some bad Nazis.

I can think of few soldiers  who elicit less sympathy than WWII Germans, yet in this movie,albeit rife with military cliches{a cruel, bestial commander, a thoughtful anti-war soldier, a farm boy,etc.]the creative team has done that. The movie opens in Italy, idyllic, with German soldiers swimming,playing  in the sun. The unit then receives orders to go to the Russian front,and of course the scenic changes are brilliant. What happens in Russia is well known and though the battle scenes are graphic and well done,filled with chaos and fear,here is where the movie takes on the weightier philosophical issues,and where i think it bogs down.

The movie is flawed- there are quite a few stock characters and some scenes which are poorly done (the maniacally laughing general comes to mind), but the battle scenes are well done and perhaps more importantly, the perspective is tremendously fresh.

Too much realism and  you may as well have strung together some old newsreels. Too much human  interest and the viewer eventually expects to see John Wayne saunter into  picture dressed as a German general with a broad American accent toting  shotguns and smoking cigars.
The most successful marriage of the two  remains The World At War -largely because the cameras gave you the picture  and Olivier broke your heart with his narration. Spielberg almost cracked  it in Saving Private Ryan with a searing first 20 minutes and then blew it  in the last 20 by turning Tom Hanks into a WW2 version of Indiana Jones -  holding off crack SS troops ( they were resting and refitting in France  after service on the Eastern Front and would have polished off his crew  with hands tied behind their backs ) in a display I have not seen since a B  grade matinee in the 60's. To say nothing of the laboured attention to the  fateful role played by the previously released prisoner.
Stalingrad is  riddled with inaccuracies and corn. The dialogue is stilted and wooden.  Many of the situations were contrived. And throughout the actors remained  relatively well groomed and well fed. Read any account of actual events -  the starvation, the lice and the appalling conditions and you will need  your cast to go in the opposite direction to De Niro in Raging Bull to  scratch the surface of authenticity. Probably an impossible story to convey  accurately.

Director Vilsmaier's cameras are always at ground level to  establish intimacy.
The attention to detail is also remarkable. Authentic  weapons, uniforms, vehicles, setting and buildings, you name it. In this  way, it is very similar to both Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan. Some  folks question the use of newer T-34/85 Russian tanks in the film as  opposed to the older T-34/76 models. I think it should be understood that  the Germans, both on offense and in retreat, destroyed Russian armor in  great numbers, and it is unlikely that older serveable tanks have survived.  The T-34/85 was in use long after WW2 ended.
What lets the film down  somewhat is its portrayal of German senior officers as sadistic martinets,  bereft of any humanity or compassion. Yet the Russians are portrayed often  as helpless, innocent and frightened victims, quite an oversimplification  considering the reality of the Eastern Front during WW2.
But scenes of  soldiers caught in the frigid, snowy landscapes of Stalingrad are  unforgetable. It cecomes evident that it was the winter, the worst in 100  years, that defeated the Germans, not the Russians. The ending of the film  with Fritz and Von Witzland huddled and dying in the driving snow is  profoundly sad.
Just some comments about the DVD. All you get are basic  features; theatrical trailer, brief bio's and language selection. The video  quality is ok, but not remarkable. My biggest gripe is that, considering  what you pay for this DVD, you cannot view the scene number you are  watching or the time elapsed on your DVD player.

There are no boot clickings and no goose-steppings here like so many of the other war movies we've seen depicting the Axis side. The movie  focuses on a German platoon sent to Stalingrad in WWII to help the  surrounded German 6th army from the advancing Russian army. It shows what  the other side went thru in the last days of this tragic campaign in the  Eastern Front, of which only 10,000 came back out of the 300,000 who were  sent. To really experience the movie, try watching it using the German  audio. The effects are awesome. Good movie.",960508800,5,625,4.43859649122807

836853,4,6304287305,"A quick summary would say this is another "" Saving Private Ryan"" film from a German standpoint. ( although Stalingrad was released long before Saving Private Ryan) Both films take us down to a platoon level to  show the grim horror and reality of war on a day by day, hour by hour, blow  by blow basis. Stalingrad was one of the most bloodiest and ferocious  battles of World War 2, which blunted Hitlers thrust into Russia and then  was ultimately a turning point. The film Stalingrad promises alot ( it is  from the makers of ""Das Boot"") but I felt I gained no real  affinity with the characters portrayed and therefore the film petered out  and the last half hour dragged on.  However, even with these deficiencies  this is still a good, strong film and has some 1st class battles scenes (  especially the Russian tank attack). It rates as one of the better war  films made but doesnt reach the same heights as "" Das Boot""",958176000,6,925,4.446428571428571
836854,5,6304287305,"From the sun-soaked beaches of southern Italy to a slow freezing death after being abandoned at Stalingrad, this film grimly depicts the human cost involved in Adolf Hitler's callous betrayal of the German military  during the Second World War.
 I've met soldiers who served on the  Eastern front; without exception, they described the Russian people as  magnificent.  Those sentiments come through in this film.  The horror of  this film comes from the relentless grinding down of both sides into  depravity.
 This simple story is about a hitherto successful assault  battalion sent to Stalingrad, then gradually cut down until every last man  is dead.  That happens in war.  Many Allied infrantry units that landed in  Normandy in June 1944, as `Saving Private Ryan' hints at, had 150 percent  replacement ratios within months.  The real difference is `Why?'
 On  a strategic basis, Stalingrad was a German success.  A Germany army of  300,000 men tied down vast Russian forces, assuring the disastrous collapse  of the Red Army drive to break through in Operation Mars just west of  Moscow.  Read `Zhukov's Greatest Defeat' by David Glantz for the story of  that battle.  Without the stubborn defense at Stalingrad, the German  Eastern front might have collapsed in the 1942-43 winter.
 This film  and `Saving Private Ryan' vividly illustrate the contrast between Allied  and Nazi methods.  Americans sometimes went to absurd lengths to save the  life of a sole individual, the Nazis were willing to throw away any  individual's life  --  and the lives of hundreds of thousands --  for ""the  glory of the Fatherland.""
 The brutality of this policy is not  overlooked.  As defeat becomes inevitable, Nazi atrocities escalate.  Nazi  commanders made it certain that no German soldier could surrender and  expect leniency.  Communist forces were no less ruthless;  for decades,  Russians were terrorized into abject obedience by everyone from czars to  commissars.  Yet, when millions of Russian soldiers were captured because  their leaders surrendered, Stalin had only one verdict, ""there are no  prisoners of war, only deserters.""
 In an America that treasures the  rights of individuals, `Stalingrad' is a chilling reminder of how little an  individual truly matters to a fanatic  --  religious, political or any  cult.  The next time some two-bit boss, or ""for the good of the company""  tyrant, insists ""My way or the highway,"" think of the ""road"" the men in  this film took and how miserably they died because of it.
 Stalingrad  was the clash of two tyrannies, each dedicated to the idea that individuals  meant nothing compared to ""the worth of the whole community.""  The result  grinds people into nothingness.  This film, watched with `Saving Private  Ryan,"" explains ""what we were fighting for.""",957312000,7,2806,5.175675675675675
836855,4,6304287305,"First of all, this was not only produced by the same ""team"" that did ""Das Boot,"" it actually plays similarly to ""Das Boot,"" only this time focusing on the Eastern Front. Both films begin  with the principal actors in leisure time so we get to know them  immediately. It worked in ""Das Boot,"" so I guess they figured,  ""Why not again?"" Frankly, I thought it was lazy filmmaking. (As a  comparison, establishing scenes for ""Saving Private Ryan""  characters don't occur until after the first half-hour.) I was surprisingly  detached from the characters of the film. The fighting scenes were all  fine, but the camera selections during the scene in the ruins were jumbled  and incoherant. This diminished any shock value that might have occurred if  the intensity had been cranked up. There was little of the urgency I've  seen in movies like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" or  ""Platoon."" It definitely shows the bleak nature of the Germans'  losing effort in Russia, and that alone makes it a must-see for war-film  buffs. However, it is not one of the greats. I'd place it above  ""Casualties of War,"" but way under ""Platoon"" in terms  of emotional impact.",956102400,2,1145,4.829896907216495
836856,5,6304287305,"The people that gave negative reviews to this movie do not appreciate the accurate recreation of the eastern front, the crudeness of the combat and after all, the characters. This is one of the few movies that depict the  german soldiers as people who has memories, desires to return home, who  suffers for an unfaithful wife, who are patriots to their fatherland but at  the same time know that their superiors are falling in abuses. (In a part  of the movie an officer has a fight against a feldgendarme because the  latter is abusing a soviet prisoner) Along with ""Saving Private  Ryan"" this is one of the best movies about the WWII ever.",956016000,,641,4.628318584070796
836857,3,6304287305,"There is no doubt that the creators of ""Stalingrad"" had the best intentions when they started this project. However, good intentions do not necessarily lead to a good picture.
The film opened in Germany 50 years  after the devastating defeat of the sixth German army in Stalingrad. To  avoid any misunderstandings, the film tried to convey one simple message.  WAR IS HELL !  Of course, it is, but unfortunately, the film is far too  clumsy and obvious to get this message across. There is really no  ambivalence in the entire picture. The viewer is never allowed to think for  himself. Director Joseph Vilsmeier bangs everything into your head over and  over again until the last one gets it. Only officers are evil, the soldiers  are all victims. Surely it was not that easy. Norbert Schneider's score is  another weakness, since it is far too bombastic. The only assets are the  good performances and the high technical level of the picture.
If you  want to see a great german war movie, watch Bernhard Wicki's ""Die  Br&uuml;cke"" (The Bridge) or Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"" (The  Boat) instead. These films managed to embrace an anti-war message without  denying that many people were (and still are) fascinated by war. After  seeing ""Stalingrad"", one could not imagine that anyone does like  war. Unfortunately, some people do.",955497600,10,1334,4.963800904977376
836858,5,6304287305,"Before there was ""Saving Private Ryan"", the most graphic and visceral cinematic battlefield carnage was depicted in ""Stalingrad"".  Ironically, the raw realism which drew rave  reviews for SPR had elicited little more than horror and negativity for  ""Stalingrad"".  I'm not a sadistic guts'n'gore affictionado, but  war is brutal and needs to be presented in an unsanitized manner.  ""Stalingrad"" has been, and remains, my favorite war film.  It is  from the German producers of ""Das Boot"", and presents the point  of view of the common Wehrmacht soldiers of Paulus' 6th Army, who were  abandoned to freeze or be slaughtered in the bombed-out ruins of the city  named for Stalin.  Neither the Germans nor the Russians are portrayed as  heroes or supermen in this film; there is only the desperation of fighters  who are forbidden retreat.  The anti-Nazi views of the producers are  well-known, and occasionally a bit heavy-handed, but there is an admirable  attempt to stick to realism.  Even the Russians are presented accurately:  from the presence of the female corpsman (yes, there were thousands of  Russian women combatants at Stalingrad), to the playing of the phonograph  song Temnaya Noch', to Stalin's cruel Edict that ""there are no POW's  -- only deserters"".  The tense ceasefires to allow tending of the  wounded are also historically accurate, and are documented in various  memoirs. The T-34 tank model depicted is, unfortunately, an anacronism.  But the hand-to-hand fighting through the rubble of the buildings, streets,  and sewers is realistic.  As is the freezing Russian winter which sapped  the energy and morale of the stranded Germans reduced to scurrying like  rats and eating their own horses.  From the cavalier attitudes of the  would-be conquerers on the train to the desperation of the hordes of  would-be escapees at the airport, this film takes us along with these  German soldiers, allowing us to sympathize with their plight and even form  a certain detached liking for them.  The futility of their campaign haunts  the poignant, sorrowful ending of the film (one can't call it a climax), as  Russia Herself swallows her violators.",955238400,332,2161,5.192419825072887
836859,4,6304287305,"If you're looking for a romantic ending type of war movie, when a hero comes in to save the day, this is not the movie to watch. This movie is told through the eyes of German Storm Troopers who are trapped in Russian  where in their only option is to be killed in battle or to freeze to death.  The besiegement of the city of Stalingrad quickly turns from a seemingly  ingenious decision by Hitler into the hellist realization of the imminent  defeat of the German army. There are two major war scenes, the openning one  in the city of Stalingrad and the second on the outskirts of the city  (infantry verses tank battle). Both scenes are good but contain slighly  unbelievable parts.  This movie will be a good addition to your war movie  collection.  Although I do not speak any foreign language, I recommend that  you buy all foreign films with subtitles and not English dub over versions.  Also see the French film ""Capitaine Conan"".",951523200,11,937,4.578313253012048
836880,4,6304287305,"I thought this was a extraordinarly excellent film.  It depicts the average German foot soldier, and what he had to endure, in the hellish inferno called Stalingrad.  Just as the ticking metronome the real 6th Army  had to hear from the Russians, as psychological warfare, so is tormenting  drama that unfolds in front of you.  One of the scenes that I didn't think  was too realistic, was when the Germans blew up a Russian T-34 tank, with a  molotov cocktail.  But, I can understand they didn't want to destroy a  piece of history.  The soldier that gets blown in half looked very  realistic though.  The scene where they were trying to escape Stalingrad,  at the airfield, was an accurute account of the hopelessness of the whole  situation.  Very few aircraft managed to escape.  Although the film  was a  little long, the ending tells it all.  It's refreshing to see a real war  film, instead of the BS Hollywood has to offer.  Watch the Battle of the  Bugle with Henry Fonda, and then watch Stalingrad.  You make the decision.",947203200,7,1032,4.674157303370786
836881,5,6304287305,"While there are some downsides to this movie, the upsides are much more prominent. The characters are good, men in an impossible situation, and how they cope. One of the reasons I love this movie is it is not a hollywood  movie in any way. The actors have real faces, Fritz has the best ears you  will ever see in a movie, not the hollywood 'perfect' 90210 mugs.  The  battle scenes are tremendous, well planed and executed. While the ending  does get a bit preachy, the fact of the matter is, it is true. War is hell,  and this battle was the 7th level of hell. Those of us sitting in our nice  warm TV rooms cannot understand in any way how these men lived during the  Battle of Stalingrad. The cold was worse than the enemy. I really liked  this movie better than Saving Private Ryan, as it ommitted the ending with  the 'Hero saves everybody with his sacrifice' Hollywood formula. For these  men, there was no way out but death and capture, and quite frankly capture  was worse than death. The hoplessness of the Battle is almost a mirror for  the hoplessness of the war from that point on, the back of the German Army  was broken at Stalingrad.

836883,2,6304287305,"First, this film has some of the best (but brief) combat scenes in any war film ever made, especially the assault on the factory early in the film (""Mir Noch!"") and the German defensive position holding out  against a Russian T-34 attack.
However, the ""war is hell""  message is beat into you at every corner.  While that is the message of  every good war movie, others like A Bridge Too Far, Die Br&uuml;cke, and Das  Boot portray that point just as well but tell a far better story than this.  This film jumps from scene to scene without really making us care about  the men involved and every German officer above the rank of Lieutenant is  sadistic.  I think their portrayal of the German leadership as evil is a  coping mechanism for the Germans to help them deal with the war.  But why  beat that message into our heads with a sledge hammer?  A truely great  German war movie, Das Boot, did a wonderful job portraying the average  German soldier's attitude towards men like Hitler without using flashing  neon signs to do it and that is the true mark of a good film.
Of the  three major war movies filmed in Germany that I've seen, this one is the  worst.  If you really want to see a good German anti-war film, get Das Boot  or Die Br&uuml;cke.  Leave this one on the shelf.",943315200,10,1280,4.407725321888412

However, it was (and may still be) the most expensive German  film ever made.  So, while it may not be Private Ryan, it's not cheap and  it may seem fresh because we don't know most of the actors.
