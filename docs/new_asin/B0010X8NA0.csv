8239258,5,B0010X8NA0,"Here's a lowdown for you since I was really worried about this not being in widescreen since someone said the LSU vs. OSU DVD was only 4:3. This DVD does present itself in 16:9. Even says so on the back of the box. The picture quality looks really good also. Sadly I can't tell you what it looks like on my Samsung 61"" DLP, cause I'm in Iraq right now on a computer watching this. But the ratio looks good (16:9) and the PQ looks better than the 4:3 stuff on the disk. So I'm pretty sure it's got a decent picture since I remember the game looking great live on HD Cable.

1st qtr - 42:39
2nd qtr - 39:34
3rd qtr - 54:51 (10+ minutes worth of challenges made this qtr so long)
4th qtr - 40:56

Talk about a great game if you are a GA fan. I won't lie, I was a little worried about Colt Brennan and Hawaii. Maybe they were as good as there stats said they were. Sadly though, for Hawaii at least, their Cinderella story didn't turn out so well at the big dance. Georgia dominated hard on Defense and Offense. Knowshon Moreno and Thomas Brown just could not be stopped. Which helped Matthew Stafford when it came time to pass (even though Stafford wasn't that great during this game). Coutu is an incredible kicker and I hope he finds a nice spot on an NFL team this draft. Wait till you see his two long kicks in the game. They probably could've been 70 yards... heh. To bad Marcus Howard didn't get to start much during his time on the Dawgs (he only began starting this year and he's a senior). He broke down Brennan and the Offensive Line this whole game. I would've liked to seen more of him, especially if he played the way he did during this game.

For Hawaii... you can tell it wasn't Brennan's fault. His O-Line was horrible and just not used to being up against such a fast defense. For his sake, I hope this game doesn't ruin his chances as a back up QB for an NFL team (don't get mad that I said back up... even Tom Brady was a back up). I'm pretty sure if anything hinders him, it's gonna be that surgery he just went through. Also if I was a Hawaii fan, I wouldn't really want this DVD cause there was not much to talk about for them here. Congrats of course for making it to your first BCS game as well as having a perfect season up to the bowl game. There really wasn't much here for Hawaii to root for. One interception was about it. The last touchdown was really nothing because GA wasn't even really playing anymore. The score should've been 41-3. Hopefully Hawaii gets some more respect this coming year and gets to play some tougher teams during their regular season schedule. They try to at least, so you can't fault them for that.

As for the Bonus Features

Shortcuts: 8:58m (16:9) - It's basically the game shortened down into the highlights.

UH in the Trenches: 2:06m (4:3) - Some of Hawaii's highlights during the season. Colt has a killer arm.

UGA in the Trenches: 2:06m (4:3) - Some of UGA's highlights. Lot of Moreno...which aint a bad thing.

Postgame Coverage: 7:03m (16:9) - Jimmy Johnson, Chris Rose, and Fran Tarkenton talk about the game and how mismatched it was.

UH teams fight song: Plays the teams song and has a follow on to the words while video plays in the background. Pretty cool since I didn't know the words.

UGA teams fight song: Same as UH's description

BCS Live Sugar Bowl Wrap-up - 2:16 (4:3) -  Talks about how GA might have ran the score up on Hawaii, because they wanted to make sure that they didn't get `Auburned' next year. They probably want to start as high as possible next year. Then they talk about how voters don't want their teams they voted for to drop to far in the rankings so they can have another chance at trying for the BCS championship or either a high BCS bowl game.

One last thing.
