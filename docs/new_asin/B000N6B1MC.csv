8175162,5,B000N6B1MC,"Twilight's cheer-dance dvd has about 5 workouts -- BUT NOT routines like in the original Cheeracise dvd. It's similar to what we used to call 'low-impact dance' workout videos. But this one is modern, feels like cheer-dance, has a few sections where high-v's, scoops, etc., are incorporated; it's similar to the 'fitness workout' section on the original cheeracise dvd, but different workouts and a bit longer and much more simplified. But they *aren't* highly-chorographed 'cheerleader' routines.

The main thing to know about TWLIGHT is that it is a WORKOUT, not a true cheer-routine video like the original.

If you are buying Twlight for more ROUTINES you'll be disapointed, these are very simple, and repeated over and over in a cardio class format; it does build stamina and rythum for beginners or average people who want to cheer, but can't do mega fast or hard routines.

It ROCKS that on this Twlight dvd you can choose to have just the music only without the instruction! Gosh, do I love that. You get sick of blabbing instruction after awhile and want to tune it out and just workout (not that the instruciton here is annoying, just nice to opt it out).

Buy this dvd IF the idea of long, dancy cheer-themed (but a bit repetitive) workouts intice you. If the original cheeracise was too technical, this one is half the difficulty level. The 45 second routines you learn in the Original Cheeracise are good, but unless you repeat them over and over it's not a full workout (only about 15 min in total for the full routines, tho the original cheeracise has 3 fun workouts in addition to routines.)

Also the Twilght DVD is a lot less sexually suggestive than the original Cheeracise which I thought was going to be more teen-themed, but found was quite grown up. The original isn't pole dancing, but it's got it's toe on the line a times (butt-slapping, and bent-over hair flicking upward stuff in the original; these are full-grown women teaching this class, not teenagers; where as Twilight is a lot more innocent in that regard, tho it is still taught by grown women). Twilight is also a full-length workout you can get into and just zone out, burn calories without too much thinking, which I like. This dvd was made to make you sweat and build your cardio endurance, and it does!

I personally LOVED how they didn't give you any instruction whatsoever and put all the length/time of the dvd into an actual workout. These workouts ARE simple to learn, and repeated over and over. You don't *need* a step-by-step instructional like you do for the original cheeracise where the movements are more complex and most definately need to be broken down.

This video is pretty much EXACTLY what I was looking for in a dance workout. Workout being the keyword. They smartly made all the moves 'dance' but still get you working without making into boring exercise. It's all pure non-stop dancing and sweating and grooving. This is what other 'dance' workouts often claim to be but fail at.

(PS: the original Cheeracise contains three fitness workouts (in addition to the featured cheerleader routines) which are great and more technical and saucy than the workouts in Twilight, but a bit shorter. The Original Cheeracise is a terrific buy as well. I recommend, both, myself, depending on what you're in the mood for or need that day. Buying both would get you about 6+ workouts and the orginal routines with instruction.  I got both DVDs in a package for 40 dollars + shipping here at amazon.)

Absolute five starts for fitness and fun and value, they are both long dvds.

Months-later Update: I seriously LOVE this dvd. You can learn the routines in one day. And then you can just work it out. I love how the sun sets on the football field. The routines are repeated over and over so you eventually know them without thinking which is great.

Truly an under-valued dvd. Great for mature women and young girls alike. Great for getting the heart-rate up and sweating and really working out with dance-like moves that don't tax your brain for long.",1228521600,2,4050,4.761768901569187
8175163,2,B000N6B1MC,"The DVD is a good idea, but poorly executed.  There is NO INSTRUCTION.  The girls just start doing moves and expect you to catch on.  The routines are technical and repeated.  But forget about showing a move, then adding on.  They just do it and expect repetition will teach you.  Very frustrating.

But if you are looking for something different and don't need instruction, then buy this video.  If you need instruction and a real workout, don't buy this.

I had high hopes for this DVD.  It did not live up to my expectations.",1201996800,,528,4.5212765957446805
8175164,4,B000N6B1MC,I have both the Cheeracise videos and I do not understand why there is a twilight version. If you compare the two twilight comes up short but it does have its good points. If you are not a dancer or if you need a hand it is excellent for practice. It goes over the routines enough times that anyone should be able to pick it up. It is also labeled correctly to give you an understanding of what type of workout you are getting. Overall not a bad buy.,1177286400,,450,4.067415730337078
8175165,5,B000N6B1MC,"It's nice to do an aerobics routine that does moves other than grapevines. The girls look like they know how to take care of themselves and I want what they have. Not only do I like the routines and moves, I feel sexy doing them.
