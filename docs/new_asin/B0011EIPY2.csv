3064505,4,B0011EIPY2,"This video was very good, however, when I ordered it, I was not made aware this was a short version of the mini-series.
 I felt great disappointment that there wasn't more to it. Only later found out  there was more that I did not receive.

3064506,5,B0011EIPY2,"The movie ""Against All Odds, Israel Survives"" is a MUST SEE if you want to learn more about the survival of Israel. This documentary-format movie is high quality, the acting is superior and realistic, and it is completely factual.
If you want just one movie that reveals the many miracles that never made the newspapers, this is the movie you need!
You will learn so much about the history of Israel as well as the many leaders of America who contributed to its survival. My suggestion... get this movie, you will be glad you did!",1284854400,13,530,4.589473684210526
3064507,4,B0011EIPY2,"This movie/DVD provides an interesting documentary of some significant events that took place during the period concerning Israel, and therefore the entire world. Some miracles were described and every miracle of God is worthy of publicity. However, I didn't find the movie quite as good as others described it, I didn't find the portrayal of the miracles was very well done. However I would recommend the DVD to anyone interested in the things of God, but only partly for the miracles.",1284249600,2,486,5.012345679012346
3064508,3,B0011EIPY2,"Well done.  Good addition to my library.  Factual as far as I am concerned.  Excellent price.

3064509,5,B0011EIPY2,"God is not dead. Miracles are happening all around us. God does not do miracles without a purpose. This video shows miracles God used in the establishment and continuing existence of the nation of Israel.

It is a warning to those who fight against Israel or cease supporting Israel, that they are fighting God or turning their backs on God.  That may not be too smart.

It is also an encouragement to those who study the Bible to see God using supernatural intervention to accomplish His prophecy for the future of Israel and the world.

I strongly encourage families, small groups, synagogues, churches, and even skeptics to watch this film.",1246060800,53,643,4.818181818181818

3064514,5,B0011EIPY2,"I love watching this DVD. Its like seeing and hearing bible stories of G-d working wonders all over again. Even ""haters"" could be convinced of the truth by watching this. I was antisemitic  two years ago until the L-rd spoke to me and opened my eyes about his love for his covenant people, and their right to the holy land. I'm so thankful  I was ""grafted in"" to my Jewish 'roots'. I highly recommend this video to everyone. SHALOM!",1358812800,2,432,4.455696202531645

The movie itself was not quite the quality that I would have liked.  It was dark and hard to see what was going on in places But the content was great. The amazing power of God and His love and protection of His people is a real comfort. As a child of God I know He is in charge, watching and taking care of me.",1351641600,2,424,4.0843373493975905
3064519,5,B0011EIPY2,"I bought Against All Odds after my Pastor mentioned it during a Sunday service.  The movie is gripping, sad, horrific but ultimately uplifting. For everyone who wonders whether God still performs miracles today...watch this movie and you'll not wonder anymore.  Israel is God's land and its people His people.  What God does for His people humbles me.",1348099200,2,351,5.12280701754386
