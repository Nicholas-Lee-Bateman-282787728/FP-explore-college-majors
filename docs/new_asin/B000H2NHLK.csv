8136099,4,B000H2NHLK,"I just finished watching this DVD a few minutes ago. I have been walking and jogging on the treadmill for years. I purchased this DVD to find out how else and more effectively can the treadmill be used. It turned out that a lot of different kinds of workouts can be done on it. Yet I have never seen anybody in any fitness saloon do something other than a plain walk or jog. Abdelhak Chegri  demonstrates two half hour programs on the treadmill on this DVD, one at walking pace the other at jogging pace and both  giving an aerobic workout also to the upper body.

In these workouts the most interesting exercises for me are walking and jogging sideways and backwards. Because I have been playing tennis for years and on the tennis court the player has to run forwards, sidewards, backwards and crosswards. I was looking for a way to improve my sidewards and backwards running performance.  I had thought of  jogging on the treadmill backwards but did not apply it. Now Abdelhak Chegri demonstrates how it can be done. Next time I go to the fitness saloon I will start applying these programs at a slow pace first. Some of the movements on the treadmill that he shows seem to be a little difficult and can be attempted as the person gets better. In the meantime many of the exercises are simple enough to be applied immediately provided that you have the necessary level of fitness.

At the end of the programs he demonstrates several stretching exercises that must be done immediately following the workouts. I already have a stretching program that I apply after each workout but I will modify my stretching program to include the several exercises he shows and do them according to his explanations.

I regret however that the sound quality of the DVD is low ; his explanations can not be heard most of the time because his speech is muffled up by the loud music of the DVD and the acoustics of the fitness saloon is bad making it difficult to understand the speeches. Sometimes there is a buzzing sound that is probably interference from electronic gadgets around. Despite these inconveniences I recommend this DVD to everybody who spends time regularly on a treadmill.",1199664000,8,2173,4.657963446475196
