2070587,5,B00029NM3Q,"Like one of the previous reviewers, I rented ""Here is Greenwood"" from the (small at that time) anime section of my local video store.  It looked mildly interesting, but I had no idea how deeply absorbing this anime would be, or how hard I would fall in love with it.  The story, though a bit over the top in some places was engrossing and funny, yet real and charming, and the characters were people you could relate to.  It was a real difference from the normally surrealistic and fantastical titles that anime is famous for.  Unfortunately, I was never able to find the VHS tapes of the series in order to buy them, and so I only had my fond memories of the series.  And so, when I found out that a DVD of the complete series was being released, I was overjoyed.  I couldn't wait to return to the familiar home of Kazuya, Shun, and company.

  What surprised me the most about this DVD relase, though, was the fact that the entire original voice acting cast was replaced by the talents of a more current cast.  This I found mildly disappointing, since the new cast doesn't give the characters as much vocal range or personality as the original, even though the dialogue is much closer to the original japanese with the new cast.  Kazuya, Shinobu, and Mitsuru sound almost alike now, and that I found disappointing, but forgivable.  Shun's voice I liked the best, however, even though the original (done by an actual woman), gave the better performance, and made Shun's verbal femininity come out.  Aside from this, I have no real complaints.  Still, I wish the voice cast hadn't been replaced. All things considered, the change wasn't really needed.

  All in all, the story is still just as charming, familiar, relaxing and funny as I remember it, with or without new voice actors.  Extra lengths of footage cut from the original US releas were even added, giving fans of the series a special treat. Though not long (only 6 episodes), I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a break from high-octane, high-action anime, and just wants a breath of fresh air.  Steadily-paced, calm, funny, comforting, and full of heart, ""Here is Greenwood"" is the one to get.",1101081600,7,2164,4.63254593175853
2070588,5,B00029NM3Q,"The No Brand Heros are back and finally have made their way to the superior format of DVD!

This has been one of my favorite anime titles since I found it in the late nineties.  I first discovered the old dubbed version in the local video store, and I found it both enchanting and refreshing.  It's kind of the comfort food of my anime collection, if anyone can relate to that.  The six episode OVA is a quirky, and fun show based on the comic by Yukie Nasu, and it has a kind of a slice of life feel to it even when it goes over the top in the most wonderfully bizarre ways.  It does seem to be a show people either hate or love.  If you're open to quirky and unusual titles, this is a great OVA to check out.

Here Is Greenwood follows the story of a fairly uptight and straight-laced young man named Kazuya Hasakawa, who moves into a boy's dormitory at an exclusive school after his brother marries Kazuya's first love.  Only then does he discover that the school he's spent so much time trying to get into (and especially his new dormitory) is filled with weirdos.  The show revolves around friendship and brotherly love as Kazuya comes of age in the chaos of Greenwood.  The episodes are also filled with homages to the original comics, such as having a character who is drawn to look like the comic artist herself in episode 3 or finding a way to work in the popular Here Is Devilwood story using the guise of a school festival.

I have to agree with what others have said about the new dub.  The original really nailed the characters and the dialogue was done to flow so naturally that it was charming and perfect.  The new dub has lots of really stiff acting, mismatched mouth movements, some poor translations (who on Earth uses ""cheesecake"" for the subbed version and allows the voice actor to say ""steamed cheese bread"" in the dub?), and a couple places where lines were dropped completely and confusingly.  So I just watch dub on my old tapes and stick to the subtitled version on the DVD.  The Japanese voice actors were sublime.

This version also doesn't have any translator's notes at the beginning of two of the episodes to point out that ""Koi"" can mean love in Japanese or refer to the fish, a wordplay that comes up when Kazuya is looking into the fish pond while thinking to himself in the Second Love story arc.  Or the fact that in Japan there is a belief that a ghost sits on the right shoulder of the person he or she is haunting, which just fleshes out a few of Mitsuru's statements and explains a bit in episode 4.  They aren't necessary to understand the episodes, but they are nice points to know and add a bit to the appreciation of the overall story.

Other than that there are places where the DVD is superior to the old editions.  Or at least more faithful.  All the Japanese title cards have been restored in the promos and the beginnings.  Also there were several seconds of footage originally cut out of episode two by Software Sculptors that have been restored in this new edition. The new dub did actually attempt to be more faithful to Sumire's nickname for Kazuya, whom she calls Yakkun in the manga and Japanese version, by having her call him Ya in the new dub.  The ""Minelva"" extra has been included in the extras section here.  It's a little joke reference to a Japanese camera ad and uses a character from the manga, whom people who've read the first English volume or the original Japanese volumes will recognize, as well as ""something beautiful"" to photograph.  The DVD also includes the Japanese DVD promo, which reunites the original Japanese voices in an homage to the old Here Is Greenwood radio program.  These guys just go nuts doing a parody of themselves and the old programs while they're at it, before settling down into a warm reunion and talk about the show.

As another reviewer mentioned, the show has a soft and pastel look as well as having actually been hand drawn.  It meshes perfectly with the very human story and eccentric characters that this art style is outside today's mainstream and makes it feel like something special.  The music is as varied and unique as the show itself, and there were lots of songs done for Here Is Greenwood in Japan as a result of the radio show as well as the anime.

If you try this title and find yourself drawn to Greenwood, perhaps it's because the term Greenwood itself refers to the place where outlaws and rebels once congregated, and Greenwood is calling out to the rebel in us still.  If the title leaves you looking for more or wondering about the rest of the stories and adventures of the Greenwood gang, you'll be pleased to know that VIZ is bringing over the manga in traditional right to left volumes.",1099872000,11,4713,4.47719298245614
2070589,5,B00029NM3Q,"I loved Here is Greenwood when I first saw it on the old VHS tapes. While the new DVD is the same excellent show, it has been redubbed for the worse.

I suspect the reason why it was redubbed was so that they could record voices on more updated 21st century sound equipment. The problem is that they did not have the original English cast do the new recording, and have recorded the new voices with a new cast. Mitsuru and Shun sound particularly crappy on this new dub.

Despite this, the show itself is great, and I give it five stars. It's funny, kind of nutty, and also dramatic at times. The DVD has the original Japanese voices, so I'd suggest you watch that. If you're a dub only kind of person, you may want to think about getting the old VHS version; the new dub is just that disappointing.",1097452800,2,799,4.28476821192053
2070590,5,B00029NM3Q,"Ok, for all you fans of the original release of Greenwood by Software Sculpters in the mid ninties, you should be warned.  I loved the original dub, and it was flawless, however ... its gone, its not on the dvd, nada.  Gone are the voice talents of Heather Quick, Eric Stewart, and the crew at Software Sculpters.  Instead, Hasukawa is voiced by Vash the stampede and while thats not so bad, the rest of the voices made me cry.  I'm going to watch it in Japanese, and I'm sure that won't disappoint me, but I really liked the original dub, and I am sooooo dissappointed that its not here.  Sigh, just thought you all should know.  Wish I'd been warned.",1094601600,6,652,4.391666666666667
2070591,5,B00029NM3Q,"It's a safe bet that anyone who has watched (and liked) Greenwood has been waiting for this DVD. It's one of those animes that people seem to either hate or love, and it has been a long time coming to a superior format like dvd. I first watched this anime 6 years ago and it really touched me with it's depiction of brotherly love. As a heterosexual teenager I was discouraged by the aversion to touching and/or complimenting and/or support that occured between guys and greenwood was a refreshing and beautiful insight into how things could be (with the exception of episode 2 which borders on quite bizzare and pushes the envelope a bit far).

Visually, the entire series is a work of art. Done in now forgotten style of anime that has been pushed aside in favor of the glitzy, pop-ish, 3D anime of the next millenium it is wonderful to see pastel colors and hand drawn animation. The music is great too, with catchy and thoughtful themes. The jazzy saxophone music during the last episode is particularily gorgeous.

While it may not be everyones cup of tea -you have to have a good sense of humor and an open mind- ""Here is Greenwood"" is undeniably deserving of a DVD incarnation; here it is, I hope you like it.",1093478400,3,1216,4.5227272727272725
8024488,4,B00029NM3Q,"A good show, it just seemed to lack focus in the middle episodes and I was left wondering where it was going. It pulled it all together well in the end.",1426377600,,152,3.935483870967742
8024489,5,B00029NM3Q,Dear to my heart.  This brings back memories.  It came new in its original case.  Back in the day when DVDs first started the cases were brittle and often lost prongs.  As this one is new there are still prongs but I can clearly feel  the case could snap or if I need to keep taking the discs out the prongs will break.  Going to replace the case with a quality on.,1425340800,,365,4.0
8024490,5,B00029NM3Q,"This is one of the rare gems of anime that I found at my local video store in the 90's and then it was never to be seen again. Not for every one this anime is dated and the new voice overs are sub-par, but the original story is intact. Just a good school drama with some funny parts. This anime warms my nostalgia bone and is worth at least a watch.",1397606400,,349,3.861111111111111
8024491,5,B00029NM3Q,Fun Japanese Cultural Joyride.  A tribute to Japanese Anime themes new and old.  This series has it all. Adolescent angst and young love.,1393718400,,137,4.913043478260869
8024492,4,B00029NM3Q,"Hasukawa Kazuya is a high school freshman with a broken heart. His first love just got married - to his brother. To flee this ridicules home situation, Kazuya moves into Greenwood, the school's dorm. There he hopes for peace and quiet... but thats not what he finds. Greenwood is home to the weirdest students on campus.

Here is Greenwood is a 6 episode OVA based on a 11 volume manga, so much of the story is left out. The first four episodes are self contained, while the last two are a two part arc about Kazuya's new crush. The funniest episode has the residents of Greenwood making a fantasy movie with characters that have ridicules names like ""Lemon Herb"" and ""Cool Mint"". I laughed every time the evil demon king was called ""Cool"".

This was my first time seeing this show, so I don't have the bias of nostalgia, but I thought it was pretty fun. Go ahead and give it a try!",1354665600,3,882,4.404907975460123
8024493,4,B00029NM3Q,"Here is one of the classics from that golden era of Japanese Anime of the 1990s.  It is a well constructed combination of a humorous and very human view into the life of youth, which is not restricted by any nationality.  I have lived in Green Wood and I love the way this takes me back.  A pity there were only six of these.",1282003200,,325,4.046875
8024494,5,B00029NM3Q,"...Or, ""Here's Greenwood"", as it's known in English. This is another great old-school Anime from the days when I was first discovering this genre. Kazuya Hasukawa enters Ryokuto Academy, an all-male boarding school, hoping to escape the heartache of seeing his first love married to his older brother, only to enter the wacky ambience of that dorm formally known as ""Ryokurin-ryu"", or ""Green Wood"", including two irrepressible sempais, Mitsuru Ikeda and Shinobu Tezuka, and of course, his roommate, the ""Prettiest girl in School""(?), Shun Kisaragi. Madness, mayhem and fun ensue, and along the way, ""Ska-Chan"" learns some key lessons, and not all of them in the classroom. I highly recommend this title for both ""Shojo"" and anime fans in general!",1175731200,,746,5.225
8024495,5,B00029NM3Q,"I don't know what everyone else is talking about. I watched the VHS of this series over and over again when I was in middle & high school (makes the rest of you feel old, eh?). Now that I'm able to watch the DVD, I recognize Shun's voice completely. I didn't even know there was a new set of talent till I read the reviews here. And until shown otherwise I refuse to believe it.

It's nowhere near as awful as either the new Eva dub or the new Akira dub which just makes me want to burn my copy every time I want to watch it. In fact I love this dub and take no issue with it. Unless my version of the DVD is special and for some reason includes the original dub.

Seriously though, this series is phenominal. For me it falls into a personal favorite OVA trilogy of ""Here Is Greenwood,"" ""Shinesman"" and ""Golden Boy.""

Although genre wise it's definately more in line with Marmalade Boy which is by no means an insult since I think it's one of the most underappreciated anime series ever.",1141689600,2,987,4.211640211640212
8024496,5,B00029NM3Q,"I'd just have to say, I've seen nearly every anime out there since the mid 80s and Greenwood has always held a special place in my heart... It's one of the most heartwarming series I've come across. Lovable characters, and my only complaint is that we don't get any more than 6 episodes worth of them!

The reason I'm really writing this review is to vent about this new dub. Now ordinarily I am strictly a subtitle guy, since I think people tend to do a lousy job with dubs nowadays. There are a few exceptions, and the old Greenwood English dub is one of them. When I got these tapes on VHS a few years ago, I fell in love with the English vocal cast. The tapes are some of the best dubs I have ever heard in anime, up there with the El Hazard dubs of such renown. When I got the new Greenwood DVD (that you obviously are considering purchasing), I was dismayed to hear the new voices. I was actually appalled. The voices are atrocious. I would do anything to have the old dub on a DVD, and I'm miserable that they decided to recast for this revival of Greenwood.

After all this time, why is it that people are getting worse at dubbing, rather than better? Sure, this dub may be more ""accurate"" to the Japanese, but god, don't trade every ounce of charm or humanity to do it... My recommendation: find the old Greenwood VHS tapes if you like watching anime in English. You will NOT regret it. This series is still one of my absolute favorites, and I hope you get to see why. If you're into subs, go for this DVD, because it's totally uncut, which is a big plus. But avoid this thing like the plague if you wanna hear Greenwood in English.",1109635200,9,1641,4.256410256410256
8024497,5,B00029NM3Q,"I am and always been an anime fan since i was a lil kid(I am 27 now), I am even a veteran of the first english dubbed Greenwood(I still have my LD's)If ur a first timer to this classic down to earth love comedy anime,then i have to say it's all the worth it. Greenwood is not like many modern ""bubblegumish"" pop anime flooding the US, and big trend des days in japan. Greenwood is very charming,and heart felt anime dat i sadly admit today's anime does not come close too. I recommend Greenwood if ur totally a down to earth kind of person. In all fairness to veterans of the first dubbing,The new dubbing is not bad at all, and comes closer to the japanese dubbing. Yes, i admit, i miss some of the voice actors from the first english dubb, but the new ones is as equal. In my opinion the first dubb was had voice tones dat r very ""gayish""(meaning suited towards the female audience)The new voice  for the dvd now sounds suited for both sexes, and in some wat better dan the first dubb in terms of speed of speech(some of the dilouge from the first sounded slow, and ""script reading"" like). Yes we will all miss the first shun's voice actor(which was a female) but the new voice is more appropriate in means dat shun IS a MALE(hope i didn't spoil anything). But Yes Greedwood is worth ur time and money for new viewers, and old viewers(i have em on LD wanna buy em from me?? hihihi No WAY !!)IF u like anime  but bored/no interest of the robots,blood/gore/sex,special powers,unbeleivable/ridiculus situations,and dominant female characters,and ur finding urself craving for good ol fashion water color anime art,heart felt meaningful struggles(with great rewards)down to earth jokes/pranks from a cast full of characters dat will remind u of ""U"" and ur school friends with life like saddness,stuggles,and joys, Then i strongly recommend Greenwood.",1106956800,,1848,4.683076923076923
