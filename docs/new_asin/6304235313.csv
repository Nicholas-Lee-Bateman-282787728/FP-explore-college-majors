824360,1,6304235313,"Once again John Carradine, a fine actor, appears in a horrible movie.  Also along for the ride is Paula Raymond, who starred in the Ray  Harryhausen classic ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms.""  There she  helped track a dinosaur.  Here she gets chained to a wall, and menaced by a  bozo.  You have vampires who never seem to drink blood, a werewolf who  doesn't bite anyone, and the usual crew of idiots who don't have enough  sense to run when the not-so-scary music starts.  This woofer barks at the  moon and has ruined every carpet in my house.  Give it a pass.  Better  still, give it a decent burial, preferably with a stake through its heart.  So why did Carradine make these movies?  Duh!  FOR THE MONEY!  And he  laughed all the way to the graveyard...",966384000,,758,4.481481481481482

824806,5,6304235313,"BLOOD OF DRACULA'S CASTLE opens w/ the world's grooviest theme song (NEXT TRAIN OUT... yeah!). This plays during the opening credits, while a woman is abducted by a monster-man named Mango. Then, it's off to Sea World for a photo shoot w/ a beautiful model w/ the greatest beehive hairdo ever. EVER! Next, we're introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Count Townsend (their last name is actually Dracula). The Count is played by the inimitable Alex D'Arcy (HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND). The Townsend's decrepit butler is played by schlock-god John Carradine! In order to keep a steady supply of blood flowing, the Townsend's have a dungeon full of tender, young lasses. Yepper, this is another Al Adamson opus. D'Arcy is every bit as stupendous as he was in SPIDER ISLAND, eating scenery like a starved termite! Enter Johnny, an escaped convict w/ a love for all things homicide (he's cra-zee don'tcha know!). He winds up at the castle as well, after abducting and killing a bikini-clad sun-bather along the way. He also murders a motorist and takes his car, while ultra-dramatic music blares. Oh no! There's an unsuspecting hitch-hiker up ahead! Oopsy-daisy, he's road-kill! Johnny finally arrives at the castle, just in time to meet the latest guests. All ""action"" dies at this point, and we see the true ""genius"" of Adamson. The non-plot implodes, leaving the nonsensical remains to grind on to the end.

824807,3,6304235313,"In the opening scene, Ann (Vicki Volante of ""Brain of Blood"" fame) has Ford problems. Rather than wait or walk along the highway, she opts to take off into the woods...with heels. She faints at the sight of Mango (Ray Young-Morka of Star trek Deep Space Nine). He is named Mango most likely because Mungo and Eegah have been reserved.

Mungo works as a caretaker for a castle leased by the vampire Townsends (Alexander D'Arcy and Paula Raymond from ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"") . John Carradine is the butler. The owner of the castle has died and the new owner (Gene Otis Shayne a dancer in the Monkees TV series) and his model girlfriend (Jennifer Bishop of ""The Female Bunch"") come to check out their new home and toss out the vampires. Also about the same time escaped psychopathic killer Johnny (Robert Dix of ""Satan's Sadists"") friend to the vampires, comes home to the castle.

The dialog and film was funny for the era. It has a good amount of camp value, some by design. My DVD from a multi-pack was poor quality with green and blue vertical lines throughout. They live at Falcon Rock Castle (say that 3 times real fast) and prefer to be called ""Living Dead"" as opposed to vampires.

824809,4,6304235313,"A rather 'hip chick's car breaks down, so she decides to take a walk in the woods in search of help - instead, a towering deformed creature helps himself.

Upon the death of a relative, a young couple come into possession of a castle in the countryside*, where an elegant vampire couple, the Count & Countess 'Townsend'** {actually The Draculas} resembling a prototypical Gomez and Morticia combination reside. The mortal couple decide to visit and horn in on their business, despite considerate attempts to scare them off, are determined to stay and have the prevailing vampires evicted. So they are imprisoned down in the dungeon for their trouble-making, along with several others who have crossed their paths before, who are kept just alive enough to provide with sanguinous sustenance.

They arrive just shortly after family member and sadistic werewolf/serial killer Johnny does. Also present in the resident butler George {John Carradine}, loyal, thoughtful, and efficient, who quite literally serves up the 'bloody mary's', and one 'Mango', a sort of Igor type servant met in the beginning, who amicably takes care of the dirty work, and the retrieval of girls for necessary life's blood, as well as being an enforcer along with Johnny.

Seems that George is also the priest of a moon cult, whom all present, or ""people like us"", adhere. The newly-arrived victim is sacrificially immolated to Luna, upon a nearby sacred hill. While all are in a festive mood, one of the prisoners scurrilously obtains Johnny's firearm, and runs rampant about the castle, dispatching the residents. And despite Mango's noble efforts, sadly tumbles in a fiery dive.

There were two remarkably strange discrepancies herein in discordance with typical folklore: First, werewolf Johnny was shot 'dead' without a silver bullet {which would hypothetically mean that he will rise again - also if he actually 'died', he would become a vampire}, and two, It seems that the Townsends did not demonstrate the inherent 'undead' strength or powers of hypnotism typically attributed to vampires - otherwise, they would have easily loosed their bonds to avoid the sunlight while keeping the intruders under control.

In conclusion, all they would have had to have done is merely sign over the real estate documentation to the Townsends, who have resided there for centuries, to avoid all their problems, yet they stubbornly persisted, then lied, and so, had to undergo persuasion.

_____________
* Of note, the film begins at Marineland, where they discover their sudden inheritance upon the tower.
** The role of Countess Townseld was originally intended for Jayne Mansfield, before her unfortunate association with Sam Brody resulted in her demise.",1381449600,,2725,5.224256292906179
824810,2,6304235313,"Disclaimer: I watched this film as a part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gorehouse-Greats-Collection/dp/B002DHACSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gorehouse Greats Collection</a>, and as such, I can't comment on the quality of this VHS tape.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the picture.

This early effort by director Al Adamson is half camp and half exploitation, and which is actually somewhat unsettling the more I think about it.  Regardless, it's not good, no matter how you like your movies:  Dracula and his wife, going under the name Count and Countess Townsend, have rented an out of the way castle somewhere in the American south-west for the past 60 years, but the owner has died and willed his property to his nephew, Glen.  Glen and his fiancee hop in their car to go disposses the Townsends, not knowing the trouble they're getting themselves into.

Meanwhile, the Townsend's loyal, loony servant George (played by the cadaverous John Carradine), and the groundskeeper Mango keep a bevy of bound beauties in the basement to satisfy the Townsend's need for blood, which Carradine extracts from the women with a hypodermic syringe the size of a rolled-up newspaper.  Last, but not least bizarre, is the Townsend's young friend, Johnny, a psychopath who keeps telling everyone that he's oddly affected by the full moon, but we'll have to take his word for it, cause nothing ever happens to distinguish his full moon psychotic behavior from his normal psychotic behavior (evidently, in prints made for TV - which this VHS version may be - there are some additional scenes to imply that Johnny is a werewolf.  That doesn't make it any less weird though).

The Count (Alex D'Arcy) and the Countess (Paula Raymond) are about as threatening as Gomez and Morticia from the Addams Family, so it's surprising when the homicidal Johnny (Robert Dix), while escaping from a mental institution, goes on a violent killing spree as he makes his way to the castle.  In the interest of concealing spoilers, I'll just add that there is at least one other scene that struck me as out of place considering the campy mood of the first part of the film, and together with Johnny's spree, it makes for that peculiar mix that I mentioned earlier.  Those viewers who seek out low budget schlock films like this, hoping for parody or exploitation probably won't get enough of either to be satisfied, and horror fans are likely to disappointed in the utter lack of chills.

Still, if you catch it the right time, and are already pre-disposed to accepting films like this on their own terms, there's a bit of charm to 'Blood of Dracula's Castle'.  Very little, but it's there.  Director Adamson throws some of everything at the viewer - some of it might stick.  Most of this cast (who really did a pretty good job considering what they were given to work with) worked together on the next few Adamson efforts, which came so quickly after 'Blood of Dracula's Castle' that Carradine, Dix, Vicki Volante and some of the others must have literally walked off one set and onto the other.  These other films include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Satan-s-Sadists/dp/B0036K9CPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Satan's Sadists</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-s-Bloody-Devils/dp/B00076ON5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell's Bloody Devils</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Five-Bloody-Graves/dp/B000063UQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Five Bloody Graves</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horror-of-the-Blood-Monsters/dp/B0036K9CQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horror of the Blood Monsters</a>, and it seems like a good bet that if you've seen any of these others and liked them that you have a chance at liking 'Dracula's Castle' too.  If, on the other hand, you hated those films, I wouldn't hold out much hope for this one.

Lastly, although I watched this as part of the gorehouse greats collection, which is on DVD, I'll have to say that it is the worst looking film of all the Mill Creek Entertainment pictures I've seen yet.  I can't imagine it would pay to clean these films up, so I assume that what we get by way of Mill Creek is the best of what's available as far as film prints go.  I'd expect that the VHS version is similar in quality - enough so that I'd warn someone to try and view a copy before buying to make sure it was a transfer that they could live with.  Unfortunately, the film isn't in the public domain yet, so no luck previewing there, nor is available to watch at IMDB.
