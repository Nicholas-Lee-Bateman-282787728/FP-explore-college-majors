7916886,2,B000038I1H,"The cover is for ""Blood Money"" with John Cusack.  The description and movie that streamed was ""The Arrangement"" with Michael Ironside and Lori Petty.
The Arrangement was fine, I wanted to see Blood Money.  Michael Ironside refers to Lori Petty's character as a ""good girl"".  Lori Petty was 35 when she filmed this movie.  A grown woman, not a girl.  It's an unnecessary, chauvanistic line.",1517097600,2,389,4.923076923076923
7916887,4,B000038I1H,"I got this because I've seen clips of the movie and just being a Huge Tank Girl fan as I am first the comics then the movie staring Lori Petty. And just loving Lori Petty as Livewire as well which is the Tank Girl voice and like this movie, she uses her trademark Tank Girl voice and personality in this movie as well...well, at least in the first act. Lori plays this stripper which is basically Tank as a stripper. She's really funny in it and she's very sexy and attractive in this movie, no nude scenes though which is appreciated from a great actress in my opinion. My favorite line in the movie was ""This used to me my daddy's room, but he's dead. So it's my room!"" lol But I felt the movie really fell apart when Lori's character loses her tough edge and becomes a sensitive feminine character who forgives his cop for cheating on her and she's just crying through out the rest of the movie which sucked for me. Although I did think it was cute when she asked for a hug but still. Though I can't complain too much, she's not playing Tank Girl in this movie. Though another favorite scene is when she strips down to underwear in front of a priest and the cops tells her ""That was very rude."" lol But other then that, the first act of Lori is just hilarious and well done, the rest just sucked! Bad writing, Lori's character crying, romance fluff and all that stuff.",1353974400,,1371,4.297297297297297
7916888,3,B000038I1H,"In his first effort at directing, Michael Ironside completes his duties in fine fashion but is hamstrung by his own script that remains mired in the clich&eacute;-filled species of police procedural cinema, with a result that this low budget affair, although being a pleasure to look upon and seldom dull, is burdened with continuity flaws and overdone devices native to a genre well-kenned to Ironside. Better titled as BLOOD MONEY for its American home video release, the film's action begins with a robbery and murder of five drug dealers, upon which Detectives Connor (Ironside) and LaPierre (Currie Graham) from a police department of an unnamed United States city, are assigned to the investigation that has also attracted the attention, for varying reasons, of two federal agencies that obviously place greater worth upon solving the crime than may be reckoned by dollar recovery. Ironside is quite ambitious within his screenplay and one readily perceives that a new primary character appears during nearly each scene in the film's first half - there are nine lead players and about 20 principals, with 11 roles cut to fit a two million dollar budget (a good portion of the cast worked at scale); however, providing appropriate dialogue for each character while fulfilling the many other directoral functions becomes a bit overwhelming for a first-time overseer. Ironside and Graham are as capable as ever in their parts and good turns are provided by Richard Riehle, Bill Dow and Jon Cuthbert, whereas peculiar Lori Petty is obviously somewhat of a tartar for Ironside and her role thankfully dims as the film (shot in Edmonton, Alberta) progresses; a standout contribution is from Brian Hebb for his cinematographic compositions utilizing highly creative lighting skills that are aptly wed to the palettes of designer Terry Gunvordahl and Jim Murray for his sets; an effective score is composed by Neil Smolar and the sound mixing is top-flight.",1124841600,5,1955,5.189873417721519
