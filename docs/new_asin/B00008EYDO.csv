7982324,5,B00008EYDO,bought this as a gift so have no personal experience with it but recipient loved it & had no problems with it.,1402617600,,110,4.045454545454546
7982325,3,B00008EYDO,"Bigfoot& Wildboy is a blast from the past but that is all. I would not recommend it as anything more. Horrible special effects. Horrible scripts and dialog. Sid and Marty Kroft were no match for Filmation's Isis, Shazam, Space Academy, and Jason of Star Command. I do enjoy watching it for the nature scenes(all of it) and the running scenes(really good for athletes). Environmentalism without being hammered on the head. VERY cute female co-star. VERY. If you like the 6 Million Dollar Man and do not mind the horrible script, this might work for you or just show it to your kid no older than 10.",1291766400,,597,4.6415094339622645
7982326,5,B00008EYDO,"This movie is one of those few that make you think ""What the heck were they thinking"" You will probably die from laughter once you see how bad the villians make-up is. Also, there always seems to be a water plant or power plant out in the middle of nowhere. Bigfoot is the only one how can run. Wildboy runs like a girl and Cindy runs like a penguin. Bigfoot has rockets on his feet which makes him a super hero. Wildboy has no powers and can speak perfect english. He also knows how to drive somehow. All in all BF and WB is a great show that needs to be remade someday. Even with the crappy graphics and total unrealism this show gets 5 stars.",1153440000,,645,4.126984126984127
7982327,3,B00008EYDO,"Found this tape at a used video store. My tape is in bad condition, so I wasn't completely satisfied, but overall the experience was very fun and very satisfactory. This show is so bad it's good, and reaches levels of serious dementia as well. Half the show is scenes of a collosally idiotic-looking Bigfoot running across prairies and fields to the scene of a crime. The first story revolves around an alien who needs to gain power from a power plant to take over the world. THe second is about ancient creatures from the depths of a cavern who plot to contaminate the town's water supply. The half-***ed acting and direction will get you laughing, while the film's avante-guarde 70's funk whatever soundtrack---espescially when it's accompanied by scenes of Bigfoot and Wildboy running for no reason at all--keeps you entranced in an otherwards laughable affair. This would definitely be good to watch if you like to smoke 'em when you got 'em so to say. Overall, I would say it's so bad it's good. Give it a watch sometime.",1091664000,,1026,4.737430167597766
