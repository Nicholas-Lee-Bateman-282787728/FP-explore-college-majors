Elliot Brindle is a bright, meek salesman, drowning in debt - and desperate as he's about to marry the love of his life. Upon receiving a phone call informing him that he's on a hidden camera game show where he must execute 13 tasks to receive a sum total cash prize of $6.2M, Elliot dismissively follows through with his first two instructions: swat the fly that is currently bothering him, then eat the fly. With thousands of dollars suddenly appearing in his bank account, Elliot remains skeptical, though comforted by the knowledge that he can stop playing at any time if only to lose every penny that he's won. Trapped into the horrors manipulated by unseen spectators, Elliot's need to complete the game escalates as the tasks grow more extreme, to a devastating point of no return.

Review - 4/5
Director Daniel Stamm has redeemed himself after making&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Exorcism/dp/B004EAPX22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Exorcism</a>&nbsp;in 2010. I walked out of the theatre half way through that movie. This film isn't an original ideal by any means, but it's a blast to watch to see what happens next. Mark Webber plays the unfortunate guy who is put through a series of dares to receive money. It's a little sick, twisted & downright cruel at times. But Webber pulls it off perfectly. We even get to see Ron Perlman. Always nice to see Ron in just about anything. You must give this one a chance. I like it better than any of the Saw films or most horror films that are coming out in theatres. It was a nice ride and the ending paid off greatly.",1396569600,,1642,4.970909090909091

6305845,5,B00IZE00MQ,There are not enough stars to rate this movie properly. Best thriller movie I have seen in years. AWESOME!! Love it yes I recommended it already.  Love Ron Perlman and Rutina Wesley Mark Webber and Devon (cant remember last name) great. Ron and Rutina outstanding.,1395792000,,264,4.866666666666666
6305846,3,B00IZE00MQ,"I REALLY wanted to love this movie.  And in some cases it did seem to be the movie I was hoping for, but overall I just felt that it missed the mark.  The acting, I felt was spot on.  With the exception of Devon Graye.  He plays Elliot's (Mark Webber) mentally challenged brother.  I'm not saying that Devon Graye is a bad actor, however.  Just in this part, I didn't really believe that he was mentally challenged.  Regardless, the rest of the crew did very well.

The story follows Elliot as he's about to marry his pregnant finance, Shelby (Rutina Wesley).  They aren't doing very well financially and Elliot soon realizes he's also out of a job.  This, along with his brother's insurance falling through, and his dad (Tom Bower) getting evicted, puts a strain on their soon to be family.  While driving home, Elliot receives a call that could drastically change his future.  If he completes 13 challenges, he will be rich beyond his dreams.  Without fully understanding the consequences, he excepts the terms and begins the game.

Sounds like a great setup for a really intense movie.  And so some degree, it lives up to it.  However, as the movie plays out, it just begins to get sloppy and fall apart.  Too many situations come about that just don't fully mix with the story and it seems that the writers were trying to tie it all together to finish it up.  I really feel they missed out on something that could have been fantastic.

Final Verdict:  RENT IT!  It isn't something that you're going to be excited about once you finish, but you'll also have fun watching it.

6305847,5,B00IZE00MQ,"I enjoyed this movie. Lots of good characters and a really tight story. It's not citizen Kane but its fun mental chewing gum. If you want to see a thriller, it's worth a viewing.",1395446400,,178,4.264705882352941
6305848,4,B00IZE00MQ,"My expectations were fairly low prior to watching. However, I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed this movie. 13 Sins is more of a low budget  psychological thriller. Elliot (Mark Webber) is the ""good guy"" central character of the story. IMO, he's presented more ""saint-like"" than ""good-guy"" in the beginning. He's fired basically for being too ethical, although he's top salesman for his company. Several loved ones are financially dependent on Elliot. He provides care for his mentally challenged brother, expecting African American fianc and racist, overbearing father, all living together with Elliot. Driving, he receives a phone call stating X amt. money will be deposited into his bank acct. if he performs a simple ""task"" or ""challenge,"" killing a fly already present and annoying him in the car. He performs, receives the deposit. The second call ""invites"" him to participate in the 13 challenges. If all completed, he will receive abundant wealth. If he refuses a challenge any amt. awarded is forfeited. Each challenge is more sinister in nature. The story focus is more about changes in Elliot's psyche than the individual challenges, although viewers preferring ""gore"" most likely won't be disappointed.  It's creepy during certain challenges, esp. when facing 2 school bullies from his past. Surprisingly, 13 Sins goes deeper than expected. Ron Perlman (Beauty & the Beast) is believable as chief investigator. Certain scenes left me wondering if the calls were real vs. mental illness. Perhaps, the performance (also, great) by the actor playing John Cusack's alter ego in ""Identity"" had undo influence. Regardless, 13 Sins is a combo. of good script, good acting and overall chemistry between characters. Admittedly, many questions are left unanswered. The second half begins to unravel somewhat, but 13 Sins is presented more as a suspenseful  experiment, with supernatural qualities, testing a theory anyone can become a monster given certain situations. It's a story of one man's psyche taken to the extreme. Elliot discovers he's not alone playing the game. Others, are also players, but on different challenges. Personally, I enjoyed 13 Sins. I didn't find it scary, but more suspenseful and creepy in nature.",1395446400,9,2236,5.3107344632768365
6305849,5,B00IZE00MQ,"Interesting view about the human nature, and what one would do for the right price. Very good movie, strongly recommend it.",1394928000,4,123,4.904761904761905
6305850,2,B00IZE00MQ,"""13 Sins"" is an American remake of a Thai film called ""13: Game of Death.""  ""13: Game of Death"" was a 2006 horror thriller from Thailand about a mysterious game show calling a poor miserable guy on the phone and promising him millions in cash if he could complete 13 tasks.  Each one is more twisted and gruesome than the last.

""13: Game of Death"" was a very good horror thriller that kept you interested and engaged with each challenge one after another.  The movie was dark but it also had a comedic side to it and the humor worked.  The story had a great premise and a strange, unpredictable ending that was great.  I recommend checking out ""13: Game of Death"" if you haven't seen it.  It's a suspenseful watch.  It's available on DVD under the Dimension Extreme label.  The DVD comes with an English dubbed version in case you don't want to read subtitles.

An American remake to me was necessary.  I wanted to see Dimension Films try it again but with an American cast.  Their remake ""13 Sins"" however didn't reach my expectations.

Problems:

1. The story's not the same.
I didn't like the changes ""13 Sins"" went with for the plot.  While many of the challenges from the original film are used, the remake changes the secret behind the game show and the ending.  The reveal of what the secret game show is isn't as strange or as interesting, and the ending isn't as effective or as shocking as the original's ending.  I can't go more in detail because I don't want to spoil stuff from the original film for those who haven't seen it.

2. The budget's too low.
The original film didn't look too expensive either (Which I was okay with) but I expected this American version to go a little higher.  It's too indie-looking.  Plus, the movie uses cheap CGI blood which I don't like.

Other thoughts:

""13 Sins"" has a couple positive things going for it.  Marc Webber (Snow Day, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World) did a good job playing the lead character Elliott.  Plus there are a couple new challenge scenes this script came up with that are entertaining.

Overall:
""13 Sins"" is a mediocre revision of an outstanding horror thriller. If you like the original ""13: Game of Death,"" don't bother with this remake.  It's a cheaper and inferior version.  If you haven't seen ""13: Game of Death,"" just check out that instead of this.",1394841600,4,2325,4.539759036144578

6305886,4,B00IZE00MQ,"Not an original movie idea by any means, in fact it's literally a remake of a 2006 Thai film, but I like this genre of ""mind game horror"" and it was well executed. It had good acting and production, which is already more than many of these types of movies can say. However, after finishing the movie it felt hollow, as if it ended too soon. Much of the backstory that they teased us with was left untouched, and I had many questions that didn't even come close to being answered. Some movies can pull of the ""leave you wondering"" bit, but this one didn't sit well and I suspect that the viewer wasn't left hanging on purpose either. I liken this movie to the TV show ""Lost"" in that you love it as you're watching it, but after it's over it leaves you saying ""...that's it?""",1497139200,,773,4.26530612244898

6306138,3,B00IZE00MQ,"Not sure if 'omnipresent stranger coercing protagonist into doing awful things by choice' is its own genre yet, but this film clearly falls into that category. More of a violent drama than a horror film, it tells the tale of an average Joe trying to find a solution to all of his life's problems by playing The Game, which involves completing 13 increasingly more difficult and deranged tasks. It has a couple of unforseen twists and turns in the script, despite the fact that we all know one is coming, and the acting was pretty solid overall. It's not something you'll be googling to see when the sequel comes out, but it's a 'fun' movie to watch in your downtime. One last note - if you like the game concept but want something a little more cerebral, I'd recommend trying out 'The Game', starring Michael Douglas.",1476662400,6,817,4.602739726027397

Ended up killing someone and causing someone to get killed.,1472515200,,330,4.190476190476191

I think this film is worth a rental for horror-thriller fans, especially if you enjoy a bit of mystery. The trailer does a good, non-misleading job of capturing the film, so, if it's still available, check that out first.

I do have to say I wish the ending (the actual, final ""reveal"") had turned out not to be who was behind the 13 Sins offers, as it seemed kind of a cop-out.

Here's my view of nearly every foreign/indy film:  Depressed people having lifeless sex with odd music playing in the background... then you see reviews saying that if you didn't like it, then you didn't get it, and you're a dumb dumb.

spoilers

I predicted much of the second half.  But damn I was hoping I was wrong.  spoilers...
I figured the father did the game when he was younger.  But I was praying they wouldn't have the retarded brother be the second contestant.  That in and of itself is enough to give the movie one star-- both for the idea that a guy with Down's syndrome (I'm guessing) is capable of all that, as well as the awful acting of the guy playing that retarded guy.  Then they never explained the origin of the game.  Or why this one family was singled out.  And they never explained how the contestants are constantly observed.  They gave us nothing but a few cryptic symbols and a few gory scenes.  I did like the lead actor, though.  Then the final scene where his African American wife got the phone call and turned it down really sealed it for me.  It was very clear that they Americanized/ sold out every trace of artistic vision in what was probably a really interesting foreign film.  If only there could be a fusion of the best  parts of American and foreign/artsy films.. But, alas. If you're anything like me, the wasted potential of the film will just make you angry.

6306681,4,B00IZE00MQ,"It really bothers me when I like a film that is clearly a rip off of another film. 13 Sins is nothing more than a horror writers take on 12 Rounds. There are no wrestlers in this one, although I'm pretty sure Ron Perlman would have made a great one. This film is about a game, millionaires have played for decades, a game that has become more prolific and a lot more fun, with the advent of modern technology. A seemingly random person receives a call telling them that they've been selected for a game show. The subject completes simple tasks and starts earning money, but as the prize goes up, so does the danger. Once the subject is a wanted felon, they must finish the game and earn the grand prize or they could be spending the rest of their lives behind bars. Veteran character actor, Mark Webber, stars in 13 Sins and he was a very odd choice for a leading man. Webber is this small nerdy guy, who seems like he wouldn't be the type to play this game, no matter the reward. Like many others, Webber is suckered in an soon becomes a wanted man, he is being chased by a local detective, played by Ron Perlman. The casting created a very awkward dynamic, as the ""good guy"" is this huge scary guy, and the ""bad guy"" is this little nerdy guy, but somehow it works. 13 Sins is certainly more horrific and crazy than 12 Rounds was, however the similarities between the two are so similar that I'm surprised WWE Films didn't attempt to halt it's release. I loved the idea of 12 Rounds and 13 Sins is just taking the same idea to an extreme, but despite the clear similarities, and the odd choice of casting, it's still a thrilling film that was definitely entertaining.",1416182400,,1668,4.366559485530547

6306716,4,B00IZE00MQ,"13 Sins has a lot in common with another recent low-budget, independent film, Cheap Thrills. In both, a down-on-his-luck young man, driven by extreme desperation, agrees to perform a series of unsavory/immoral/illegal acts in exchange for ever larger quantities of money.

The protagonist of 13 Sins, a psychological thriller written by David Birke and Daniel Stamm and directed by Stamm, is Elliot Brindle (Mark Webber), a harried and harassed insurance agent who has a number of people depending on him for their livelihood and support. These include his pregnant fiance (True Bloods Rutina Wesley), his mentally-challenged younger brother (Devon Graye) and a cantankerous racist dad (Tm Power) whos been evicted from his home and now has to move in with Elliot and his black girlfriend. Then Elliot is summarily fired from his job, leaving him utterly bereft and desperate, until, that is, he receives a call from a mysterious stranger who offers to make Elliot a fortune if he successfully performs 13 tasks as part of a surreal game show, the hitch being that he cant let anyone in on what hes doing or hell lose all his winnings.

At first the tasks seem simple enough, but as they escalate in intensity, it quickly becomes apparent that the object of the game is to show that anyone can be turned into a monster. And Elliot is only too willing to prove that point.

The mood is grim and the humor pitch-black in this Kafkaesque tale of an ordinary man caught in an incomprehensible nightmare from which he cannot awaken, a nightmare filled with shadowy figures and disembodied voices that hold him in their implacable grip - though, if truth be told, the lure of easy wealth can be awfully hard to resist, even when the price is as potentially dear as it is here. The movie is creepy and disturbing in its unflinching look at the morally depraved depths to which desperate people will sink in an effort to ameliorate their situation. It forces us to look at a lot of unsettling aspects of human nature - aspects we might not be all that willing to face - but thats what makes it an effective little horror film in the long run.",1406937600,,2134,4.731182795698925

6306735,3,B00IZE00MQ,"It's always nice to see a small film with no buildup get released and then discover that it's better than some of the big name titles coming out. Sure we all want to see the major releases but those small flicks often offer some great storytelling that outweighs blockbuster titles. Such is the case with 13 SINS.

Elliot Brindle (Mark Webber) is as far down on his luck as you can be. About to be married and expecting a child the company he works for decides to fire him. Their reason is that he isn't cut throat enough, that he doesn't have the gumption it takes to be a go getter. This means that he won't have insurance so his mentally disabled brother won't be taken care of. At the same time his father is facing eviction from his apartment and will have to move in with him as well. At the end of his rope, Elliot has no hope.

Then while sitting at a red light a cell phone begins ringing. He finds the phone sitting on the car seat and a mysterious voice tells him if he is willing to play a game then he can earn $100. All he has to do is swat the fly in his car buzzing around his head. He does so and a text alert tells him he now has $100 in his account. The voice tells him there is a game consisting of 13 obstacles and he's just passed the first one. If he eats the fly, he gets more money and moves on towards the next event. Bon appetite!

Elliot thinks things are going well now. He has the chance to get himself out of debt and to move on with his life. He gets another call that lets him know that once the game begins he can't back out. To do so means he forfeits everything he's won so far. He agrees only to find the tasks more and more outrageous, eventually putting his life on the line as well as his freedom when certain felonious events are asked of him. Just how far is Elliot willing to go?

The end prize is $6,000,000. On top of that the voice tells him that all traces of his crimes will be erased and he won't end up in prison. But halfway through the 13 events he is told that should he now quit he not only forfeits the money but is on his own when it comes to the police. Arson, moving a dead body and more await Elliot, but only if he carries on, all the while being watched through various means by the mysterious voice.

The movie develops with each new request of the voice, forcing Elliot to move on to more and more events that could lead him down a path of no redemption. But each one of these events not only puts more money in his pocket, with the first batch they begin to change Elliot from the milk toast that he begins as to someone to be reckoned with. But as each item gets more and more violent his willingness begins to falter. Will he complete all 13 items?

While watching this movie you can't help but ask yourself would I be willing to do what Elliot has done? Would I have even started following these tasks? Or would I simply have allowed the world to come crashing down on me with the hand that life had dealt? It's not an easy answer to come up with. If you've ever felt at wits end you know that there are times you might do anything. But that's the true word that comes into play, anything. Would or could you do anything?

The movie is well made and the pacing is great with each new item laid out and the consequences of each there to witness. As Elliot goes from willing contestant to possible patsy you wonder if he will actually succeed at these tasks. And if he does, will those responsible for the game actually follow through? In the end the movie holds your interest from start to finish.

There are some gruesome and gory moments here but most are fairly light compared to things seen on TV these days (with one possible exception involving and amputation). As the world becomes a crazier place these days with people seeming to do things thought unheard of at one time, you begin to wonder if perhaps the game is actually being played today. Keeping that thought in mind, if someone calls your cell phone and asks you to swat a fly? Hang up.",1403654400,,4018,4.175483870967742

After watching the trailer, and the description of the film, it didn't sound like it was going to be much, but I'm glad I took a chance on it now, as it proved itself a very interesting little horror film that could definitely spawn a series of sequels.

The film evolves around Elliot played by Mark Webber. He is about to get married, and is also providing the finance to keep his autistic brother out of mental hospitals. He lives with his father who is an old bitter racist and is just as broke as the rest of them. Struggling to get by on what he makes, he receives a phone call out of the blue from a mysterious English man who asks him if wants to be a contestant on a game show. However, this is not your typical game show. This man can somehow see Elliot's every move. The first challenge he is given is to kill a fly that is bugging Elliot inside of his car while he is stopped at a red light. Upon killing the fly Elliot receives a text message informing him he has just won $1000. The caller returns and says challenge 2 is to eat the fly for something like $5000? To which Elliot does, and receives a text he has just received $5000 to his bank account. Now the caller rings once more and offers him the chance to keep playing or leave now? After saying something silly and pressing 1 to confirm he is in, that's when the challenges become much harder and gruesome. Elliot figures he really needs the money for his wedding, wife carrying with child, and his brother. However one of the rules is, once you sign on, you can not leave, otherwise you loose everything.

Although it sounds a bit like the Saw movies in ways, you can clearly tell Saw is an inspiration to it, but it's definitely not a Saw type of movie. I found it more something like a horror version of Rat Race. Not so much the race, but what John Cleese and his rich friends where doing in that movie by being so bored they are daring people to do things and betting on it. It also makes you think, just how far would you go to receive a large amount of cash? And you can guess from the title that the sins asked to preform are going to go through all the deadly sins, and it does not disappoint.

There is some cool moments, decent gory bits, and an almost perfect ending. The ending is fine, it's what they continued onto it that I thought probably should have been cut off, but apart from that, it's an enjoyable movie, with a good cast. It has a few laughs here and there, but as for being scary? I dunno, nothing scares me anymore, so I can't say if it will frighten anyone else... I mean I watched Wolf Creek 2 and found it hilarious, but my sister in law turned it off because it was too much for her to handle. So you'll have to see this for yourself to determine if it's somewhat scary?

6306753,4,B00IZE00MQ,"13 SINS has a lot in common with another film that was recently released called CHEAP THRILLS. Both are entertaining, but CHEAP THRILLS warrants a five star review, while 13 SINS falls short in a few key ways.

The similarities between the films are pretty major. Both are about meek men with money problems who find themselves out of a job. Both movies go a little overboard to set up intensely hopeless circumstances, although 13 SINS definitely wins the race in this regard. Our lead, Eliot, is about to get married and have a baby, is financially responsible for the health and well-being of his mentally challenged younger brother, and is forced to accommodate his recently-evicted father (a racist who openly detests Eliot's black bride-to-be). In both movies, the lead meets a rich benefactor who offers money for a series of increasingly bizarre and dangerous actions. The ultimate message of both films is about what it takes to change a person as well as how far someone might be willing to go to provide for both themselves and their loved ones.

13 SINS takes a sinister and mythical approach to its film. In CHEAP THRILLS, the lead character (as well as an old chum from school) both meet a rich couple who shell out money for the actions in the guise of bets. The film is a gritty, intense, and deeply personal look at what would drive anyone to do the unthinkable. The movie pulls no punches, doesn't bother answering unimportant background questions, and avoids a complex plot in favor of complex character development.

13 SINS, not so much. It creates an ominous mythos to its story by making the rich benefactor a faceless British voice on a phone who tells Eliot that he has been chosen to take part in a game that involves thirteen challenges. The first two -- kill a fly and then eat it -- seem innocuous enough, and they win him several thousand dollars, so he agrees to participate in the remaining eleven challenges under the direction that he is not allowed to tell anyone else about the game nor quit the game without losing all of the money he's gained. The voice seems to belong to some network of intensely powerful people who can seemingly see all and know all. No matter where he is, the voice not only knows what Eliot is doing but can access him via any phone at all with the same obnoxious, circus/calliope ringtone.

This, of course, makes our villain a lot more impersonal than the couple from CHEAP THRILLS. I don't count this against the  film since it means all of our focus is on Eliot, who is amazingly acted by the relatively unknown Mark Webber. He does a terrific job of helming the film through his character's chaotic and disturbing decline. Also, the motivations behind the unknown antagonist are given a wide, unearthly scope that isn't found in CHEAP THRILLS, which makes it about cold-hearted entertainment. That may be the case here -- we have a B-plot that follows cop Ron Perlman around as he talks about the game with a cross-eyed conspiracy theorist who gives us some hasty exposition -- but it's never fully addressed. What IS shown is that there is a level of complexity and planning in place that goes way beyond just watching someone do nasty things. The story, especially in the final acts, develops the insights and twists that make these kinds of tales richly satisfying when more solid answers are in short supply.

However, unlike CHEAP THRILLS, 13 SINS jumps the rails in the final ten minutes or so in an attempt to create an ending that modern audiences might find a little more palatable. I wouldn't call it a happy ending, but I also wouldn't say it's a sad one, and it's that sort of ambiguity that robs the film of its juice. Instead of putting a period on the message it's spent ninety minutes explaining, the movie backs off and gives the audience a sort of apologetic shrug, rendering meaningless any of the gloom or glory that the final shot is meant to convey. It's like the script was penned by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke; they couldn't agree on whether or not man is essentially good or evil,  so they just went with a big, boring question mark at the end.

Combined with a few gaps in logic and a not-altogether-convincing acting job by Eliot's mentally challenged brother (his part in the film felt almost caricatured), this inability to stick the landing makes the film a four star job at best. It's still entertaining and propulsive and worthy of the questions it poses, but if you really want a movie to hammer its point home with unflinching artistry, I recommend CHEAP THRILLS. Viewers who are prone to depression, however, might want to stick with this, slightly more ambiguous, offering.",1401753600,,4677,4.688185140073082

6306755,4,B00IZE00MQ,"13 SINS is a bit reminiscent of THE GAME (1997) with Michael Douglas, except that the games in this 2014 film are considerably more brutal, and star Mark Webber is, up to a point, a willing participant.

Elliot (Webber) is a meek, likable young man who is in major financial trouble.  He has a mentally disabled brother (Devon Graye) and an elderly father (Tom Bower) that he must care for, and his fianc&eacute;e (Rutina Wesley) is pregnant.  If all that isn't concern enough, hes also deeply in debt and he has just lost his job as an insurance salesman.

Driving along one night, Elliot receives a strange phone call, informing him that he is a contestant on a game show, and that if he performs thirteen tasks, he will become an instant multi-millionaire.  After each challenge is completed, cash appears in his bank account, but if he refuses any task, all that sudden money will disappear.

The first task is relatively simple.  He must swat a flyfor $1000.00.  Now, if he eats the fly, he gets an additional $3600.00.

Elliott eats the fly, but then the challenges accelerate, becoming more bold, dangerous, violent and extremely gruesome.  Indeed, soon the police (Ron Perlman) are looking for Elliott on a variety of charges.

Not wanting to be a Spoiler, Im not going to tell you any more of the plot, except that the third act of this tense, entertaining drama is filled with some surprising twists.

Pruitt Taylor Vince co-stars in the thriller, directed by Daniel Stamm, who co-wrote the script with David Birke.

The Blu-Ray from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary by Stamm and several cast members, an alternate ending, a Making of featurette and more.

A mysterious caller contacts Elliott Brindle, well played by Mark Webber, and offers him a way out of the financial disaster that has engulfed him.
One simple deed of killing  a common house-fly nets Elliott a one thousand dollar prize and the next even more. There are 13 tasks that Elliott must complete, and the caller promises Elliott will be rich enough to forget all about his problems should he complete them all.
I have to admit that the feel of this film is much the same as the movie ""Cheap Thrills"". But 13 SINS has some uniquely dark aspects that kept me on the edge of my seat. Pruitt Taylor Vince (Constantine, Monster) is in a supporting role as another person trying to complete all 13 tasks. I always enjoy the characters Vince brings to the screen.
The film is polished, well produced despite it's low budget and quite gory. The ending was interesting and clever. It seems that I have been inundated with this type of films lately, and I will try and find something more upbeat to review in the next few weeks.
13 SINS is rated with a well-deserved R for violence, bloody images and language. The movie includes many gory scenes that will make thriller/horror fans bloody happy.

I saw this at a bargain house because all the other movies were still all the Oscar nominations and I had already seen all those, so I thought I would give it a shot. The plot sounded interesting.  Im glad I saw it. It turned out to be pretty entertaining. I like going to these movies where you haven't really seen any previews of them and don't really don't what they are about. Its a nice surprise when they turn out to be good like this. I never got bored and there were parts in the movie that made me sit up and bite my nails and even on the edge of my seat a little. Its about a guy whos down on his luck who gets contacted by someone to play a Game where he can profit greatly. I know youve heard this type of concept like The Game and The Box. Even though this was a lower budget movie, I actually liked this better than those. I think it gave you just enough info to intrigue you unlike The Box where I didn't really get it at the end and The Game that wrapped everything up to neat and tidy. You have enough questions to keep you talking about it after wards, but not so many questions where you give up on it. It has Ron Pearlman in it and Rutina Wesley from True Blood too.

Before my critique, let me start by saying that most VOD movies cost $6.99. This movie cost me $9.99 to rent, and it was terrible. The makers of this movie were attempting to make a ""Saw"" but with a slight twist. The main character has to do some ""twisted"" acts in order to receive some money via direct bank deposit. The story was at times slow paced, and the writing was amateurish. There were moments in the movie that the director didn't know if the scene should be horrific or comedic.

I really wanted something diabolical but hey... you can't get what you want every time. Except for Ron Perlman, I didn't recognize any actor. However, the performances were fine and the characters were rendered believable, which must not have been easy for the actor playing the main protag.

If it had ended like this one, it would've been forgettable. Its interesting that they took it in a different direction for its Americanization. I get it. We are light weights in horror these days. So, if you haven't seen the Thai one, and you aren't afraid of subtitles, check it out. Its a very different experience, though there are some identical challenges but not all.",1397433600,,1465,4.630769230769231
6306776,5,B00IZE00MQ,"Elliot (Mark Webber) has just been fired for being spineless. He is soon to wed an African-American girl (Rutina Wesley) while caring for a mentally challenged brother (Devon Graye). And oh BTW his racist dad (Tom Bower) just got evicted and is moving in with him. It all starts out simply with a phone car from a man who knows more about Elliot than anyone should...up to the fact there is a fly in his car. The man offers Elliot $1,000 to kill the fly and even more to eat it. Elliot agrees to play the game for money. He must complete all 13 tasks for an all or nothing win. The task intensity grows almost exponentially as does the reward. Elliot is forced out of his shell becoming a fugitive.

The intensity factor is good. I had to get out of my seat a few times. The end has nice little twist.

Worth viewing for those who like this type of film. I would also recommend ""Cheap Thrills"" for a similar film of men being paid to perform dangerous tasks.

8646799,4,B00IZE00MQ,"13 Sins is quite a fun movie in the growing genre , viewers are watching you, what will you do for money?  Hadn't heard of Mark Webber before, but he does a decent job as the average guy who becomes the player.  There's two highly recognisable faces in this, although neither have much screen time, in Ron Perlman (Sons of Anarchy) and Rutina Wesley (Tara from True Blood).  It's a shame we don't see more of them, especially Wesley who plays the fiance of the main character.  It does a get more and more far fetched as the movie goes on, and you wonder why cops don't just shoot him at one stage. The twists are a little predictable.  But overall, if you like this genre, 13 Sins isn't a bad entry into it.  Would have liked a bit more reveal on what the show and who it's audience was though, as we don't really learn much about them, how do they have cameras everywhere good enough to see a fly, did they even plant the flies as well?",1518566400,,938,4.212290502793296
