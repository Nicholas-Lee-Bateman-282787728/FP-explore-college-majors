8036527,5,B00061QJDA,"This is a real honest to goodness tear jerker full of honesty, compassion and anger all wrapped in love for each other. Now I love Nana too. This very personal documentary aroused feelings about o it my own grandparents and made me want to connect with them as people. I love this movie because it has raised the bar in my search of genuine docs about conversations with family. TWO THUMBS UP!",1443398400,,393,4.472222222222222
8036528,5,B00061QJDA,"This is not a movie, it is a short documentary about the life of an elderly woman.  She talks about all the ups and downs she has experienced in life.  Definitely worth watching at least once because there are so many life lessons presented.",1329955200,,241,4.454545454545454
8036529,5,B00061QJDA,"I showed this film in my sociology of family classes last year.  Students loved it and found a variety of things in it to discuss.  I also recommend Michael Apted's ""Marriage in America 2.""",1277424000,2,189,4.529411764705882
8036530,5,B00061QJDA,I wish I had had the foresight to make filmed interviews with the matriarchs and patriarchs of my own family. I know Halpern's children and grandchildren will treasure this work. It's a wonderful portrait of an interesting woman who lived through interesting times in our country's history.,1273363200,,290,5.191489361702128
8036531,5,B00061QJDA,"Mary Mirabito, the lively 96 year old star of this wonderful documentary, has earned the right to lecture us on life, love, and family. And she does...with frankness, tenderness, strength and, most of all, love.  There is no better way to spend 90 minutes of your life than to concentrate on every word and scene in this beautifully crafted film.  Even the sad and ugly parts will not turn you away because Mary faces them head on with full emotion and complete acceptance.  Here!! Here!! to ""Nana"" who lived 12 more years after the start of this project...and who will live with our family always.",1247184000,4,598,4.6761904761904765
