4237622,3,B00402FGEO,"Blizzard was a great movie. The kids enjoyed it (especially my nine-year-old daughter). The teens didn't complain, and even my husband and I were able to sit through it. But Prancer was horribly boring and, well, dumb. Not even the nine-year old could stand it. I recommend buying Blizzard separately for less.",1359158400,,310,4.980769230769231
