8657672,4,B00KCY65G2,"The basic scenario for Sylvain Chomet's comedy-drama is reminiscent of that of SHINE (1994).  A young man, the eponymous central character (Guillaume Goulx) in his early thirties demonstrates a higher-than-average talent for piano playing, but does not speak.  Looked after by a pair of overbearing aunts (Bernadette Lafont, Hlne Vincent), he has little or no outlet for his talents.  He discovers in the apartment below him an eccentric woman, Mme. Proust (Anne Le Ny), who administers a concoction to him, enabling him to indulge in fantasies as well as uncover the mysteries of his past.

The plot is a straightforward one, dramatizing the ways in which we often deal with trauma by repressing it.  Attila Marcel's concoction is nothing more than a means by which he learns to reconnect with it.  What happened might have been unpleasant, but in the end he has to learn how to deal with it.  Mme. Proust eventually passes away, and the apartment is taken over by someone else; but the experience has proved cathartic.

What renders Chomet's film so entertaining are the settings, a series of suitable visual metaphors for the lives Marcel pursues.  The apartment he shares with his aunts is perpetually spick-and-span: everything in the right place so that Attila can cope with life around him.  The aunts believe that this is the best thing for him; as the film unfolds, we understand how they have imposed their will on him, as a way of compensating for their own spinsterhood.  The seedy dance studio, where Attila plays the piano for young girls just beginning their careers, is both bare and impersonal; the only noteworthy item of furniture being the piano.  This sums up the aridity of the young man's life; it's hardly surprising that he does not want to speak.  And there is Mme. Proust's apartment, a positive riot of fauna and flora, with tatty furniture and a strange visitor M. Cuelho (Luis Rego) who always seems to be waking up from a trance.  The confusion of her apartment expresses Attila's state of mind; it is only through the concoction that such confusions can be straightened out.

The film comes to a predictable conclusion as we discover precisely what happened to the young man's parents.  Perhaps he does not need to take the concoction any more; he seems to be 'cured,' at least temporarily.  But director Chomet suggests that, if he wanted to take it once more, there would be nothing wrong.  Even though it might be comprised of illegal drugs, it has a beneficial effect in the end.",1440892800,,2515,4.850117096018735
8657673,5,B00KCY65G2,"This film revisits the themes of Chomets previous animated masterpieces,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Triplets-of-Belleville/dp/B0001IN0MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Triplets of Belleville</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illusionist/dp/B004ZG0LYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Illusionist</a>. Both the former film and this one are about protagonists who lost their parents in very early childhood and have been raised by female relatives (here, aunts rather than a grandma) who have driven them to become virtuosos, although in the process they have lost the power of speech. (The Chinese girl in this film even looks like the grandma in Triplets and the man in the turban in the shop window in The Illusionist.) This film shares with The Illusionist that films concern with the relationship with the lost father in particular.
Although the magic of Chomets animation is missing here, the film is a fitting climax to what should be seen as a trilogy. Without offering a spoiler, I can say that this film offers redemption where there had been none, no resolution or closure, for the protagonists of the previous two films.",1439596800,,1238,6.509090909090909
8657674,4,B00KCY65G2,"Paul is in his thirties, he is mute having seen his parents die when he was but two. Since then he has been brought up by his fabulously eccentric aunts and has become something of a virtuoso on the piano. Then a fascinating neighbour tells him that she can help him by using a concoction of herbal tea.

He soon starts to see this Madame Proust regularly and starts regression therapy of sorts. She says that `you can drown bad memories in a flood of tiny joys' - which is sage advice indeed. The film deals with the cycle of life, the past and a host of human issues.

What unfolds is a beautiful film in terms of style and sentiment about his life and those around him, with so much thrown in that it seems to be endlessly inventive. Guillaume Gouix as Paul and Attila (his wrestling father) is superb - even more so when you consider that he is unable to speak. Everyone plays their roles to the limit and no one goes over the top to lose believability. This is just a wonderful film with music, taxidermy, tree hugging and a whole lot of love besides - one for French film fans and for those who like something a bit different, but in a really nice way.",1434326400,,1158,4.259090909090909
