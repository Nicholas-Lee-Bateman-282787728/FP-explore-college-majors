665773,5,6303484115,"This movie was perfect for helping the children in my daughter's elementary class understand childhood cancer. Although these children did not know her before she was diagnosed, this was a wonderful way to educate them. After the movie was played for the class and their parents, my daughter seemed to feel better about going to class, and less nervous about her hair loss. Leave it to Charlie Brown and the gang to bring children together regardless of the situation at hand. I would recommend this movie to elementary aged children with parental supervision.",1032652800,8,560,5.032258064516129
665774,4,6303484115,"A reason that watching this movie is tough (as it is for any fan of PEANUTS) is that it seems to be a forewarning of what was to happen to Charles Schulz.  The movie is very very melancoly... Most Peanuts specials (non-holiday related) helped explain and help kids come to deal with things that they SHOULDN'T have to deal with yet... things that are difficult even for ADULTS to handle.  It is about a new girl (to the best of my recollection.. it's been a few years since I've seen it).  Charlie Brown or Linus likes her, and finds out she has cancer.  This movie is about them trying their hardest to come to terms with it (and about children can be the most raw, honest, and cruel.. i.e., the kids at school).  However, when the movie hit it's lowest, I'm glad the writers did not decide to kill the girl off.  THat would have been cruel.. it happens too often in reality.
Cancer sucks.

7849004,5,6303484115,"This is the saddest of the peanuts specials and you'll need the kleenex for this one. the story follows linus's friend janice who gets sent home from school due to her being very sick and then she goes to the hospital. when charlie brown and linus visit her in the hospital, linus learns that janice has leukemia and she explains the tests she underwent and the treatments she'll undergo to treat her cancer. while charlie brown and linus are walking home from the hospital, linus turns to charlie brown asks him the title and then walks off while the song ""farther along"" plays in the background and i'm not ashamed to admit, the kleenex box was almost empty when i saw that part. anyhoo, i won't spoil the rest of this tearjerker, but as i've said before, mr. schulz really knew how to tug at your heartstrings.",1345766400,,813,4.537414965986395
7849005,5,6303484115,"I've been a Peanuts fan all my life, and was surprised by the serious theme of this story re: cancer. Having lost a relative to that, this story held my attention from the beginning.

A new character named Janice, a close friend of Linus's, has contracted leukemia, and winds up in the hospital. The Peanuts gang all react differently to the tragedy; Charlie Brown is sympathetic, Lucy is mean (this was one time I really wanted to deck her), and Linus is devastated, and tries to do everything he can to help her out, including defending her from an ignorant bully who mocks Janice when she loses her hair from chemotherapy.

I will not post the ending here. I do not want to ruin the story.

But just so you know, not the entire story is all serious - Snoopy is always up to mischief, bringing some much-needed comedy to this story.",1215734400,,834,4.473684210526316
7849006,4,6303484115,I watched this at age 4 when it first came out. I have remembered it all these years... just vaguely. Enough to scare me throughout my childhood. I really do NOT reccomend this for children under 7. All I knew is that there was a sick girl and charlie brown was there and it made me very sad. I would say if you plan on showing this to a small child to do more than my parents did and actually sit down with your child and explain EVEYTHING to them and watch it with them instead of popping it in the player and leaving. Answer any questions they have. Other than poor judgement on my parents part this movie is very very good. What i remember of it anyway. Like I said it would be excellent for an older child/tween.,1190764800,,717,4.128571428571429
7849007,5,6303484115,This video helped both of my girls understand why one of them had cancer and what both of them were going through.  It could have been based on my daughter's experience with Leukemia!  SHAME on the people who are trying to cash in on used videos!  I just gave my copy to kids who needed it.  The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society used to give copies away to patients so check there before you pay $74+  for a used video.  I'm sorry to be harsh but this is not a good topic to take advantage of people!!!!  We parents are already paying an arm and a leg for treatment...  Grrowwwllllll.....,1170633600,6,585,4.302752293577981
7849008,5,6303484115,"This is a wonderful video! At the school I work at we had a student who was suffering from leukemia and had lost all of her hair. As a kindergarten teacher it's often hard to know what words to use to try to explain such a difficult subject when my students start asking questions. This video does a great job of explaining in terms that young children understand, without going over their heads. My students were so touched that they began bringing in their spare change and allowance to donate to sick kids at the children's hospital in our area.  I would recommend this video to viewer's of all ages!",1139184000,,603,4.4818181818181815
7849009,5,6303484115,"When this first premiered in 1990 I already had a very high admiration of Charles Schultz-after seeing this I upgraded my opinion. Schultz took a storyline I doubt anyone else would ever have touched on and managed to get a story that was watchable for all ages out of it. The subject is childhood lukemia.

  The story goes that Linus's best friend Janis starts to become ill and goes home from school. To he and Charlie Brown's surprise she ends up in the hospital. When visiting her she informs them she was diagnosed with leukemia. She describes her tests and even the side effects of her chemotheropy in detail to a frightened Linus. The story plays out the various dilemas of a young cancer patient-her relatives feeling left out,the fear of others around her and a very unsettling scene in which Linus has to angrily protect Janis from a bully who taunts her because of her theropy induced baldness. And all done in juxtapossion with the changing seasons. In the end Janis recovers but I would say she got REALLY lucky.

  No one in my family ever had leukemia but five years ago I almost lost my own mother to cancer and thanks to this I was a little better prepared for it. This may be the most serious of the Peanuts specials but it is an important,educational and uplifting story and I praise Charles Schultz for this strong effort. And I hope that it is these type of things that he will always be remembered for.",1116374400,5,1425,4.525291828793774
7849010,5,6303484115,"This movieis great for helping kids understand childhood cancer. I watched it in my eighth grade PE class and thought it wad ridicuously cheesy, but two days later my little brother was diagnosed with leukemia. Having seen the film, I understood the symptons and treatment of childhood leukemia. I felt more confident than my parents about my brother's illness and what was going to happen. I highly recommend this video for any children who know a young cancer patient, especially siblings because it touches on our struggle too.",1109289600,3,530,5.034090909090909
7849011,5,6303484115,"My daughter was dx'd with leukemia when she was 2 and 3/4 and we explained as much as you could to a child her age, about what was going on in her body. We really wanted her to know what was happening to her so she could fight it her best-this video was invaluable to her  and our family. She watched it umpteen times in the hospital and it really helped her understand that she was not alone and what she had to do(needle sticks, tests, loss of hair, etc) to beat her leukemia. She is now almost 6 and in remission for 3 years and off chemo for 7 months! We still pull out this video every once in a while to watch:) I have to admit though-that if this is a video you want and you have a child with leukemia or some other cancer-(...)the American cancer Association. (...)since that is who funded the making of this video.",1066262400,12,823,4.14375
