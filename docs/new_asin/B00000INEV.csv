1226110,5,B00000INEV,"My 2.5 month old baby almost always falls asleep when she's in her swing.  I put her in her swing in front of the TV and put in the Baby Einstein video.  Not only did she stay awake, she ooh'd and ah'd at the colors on  the screen, and followed the toys as they moved on the screen with her  eyes!  The same holds true for the Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein videos  (the Baby Einstein lullaby CD is excellent as well).",947721600,4,417,4.024390243902439
1226111,5,B00000INEV,"This video is wonderful!  I was sure that Jesica, being only 4 months old, would have no interest in this video as she doesn't with most everything else on television. But this video is very exciting to her.  She will talk  to the objects she sees.  I am very proud to have this for her and look  forward to getting Baby Bach and Baby Mozart to switch them out for  variety.",945561600,5,374,4.197183098591549
1226112,5,B00000INEV,"I think the video is wonderful (along with the Mozart and Bach versions).  I was not looking for Julie Clark to teach my son anything, other than give him a little entertainment that was age appropriate.  The bottom line: he  liked it and I didn't feel like I was ""sticking"" my kid in front  of cartoons etc.",938131200,9,308,4.350877192982456
1226113,5,B00000INEV,"My baby started watching this when he was 3 months old and just loves it! I wish I had gotten it even sooner! It shows bright colorful images which really caught his attention.  Counting and nursery rhymes are recited  in  numerous foreign languages.  After watching it for just a few days, he  recognized certain parts and he smiled, laughed and screeched in delight!  A month later I began repeating the nursery rhymes and counting and he  thought that was great too.  Julie Clark, the creator of this video, had  taped her daughter on this video at the end and I think my son is in love  with her, he always smiles when she appears.  She has put out 2 other  videos called Baby Bach and Baby Mozart which are also fabulous!  No, I'm  not getting paid to write this, it's just that my son enjoys these so much  I just had to share my opinion.  He is 8 months old now and still loves  them!  The price of the video on www.amazon.com is great, I paid a lot more  for them at the mall.",927504000,21,984,4.25

1226170,5,B00000INEV,"Much like the Voyager Interstellar Golden Record launched into space in 1977, this won't teach the foreign mind any of the languages, but it will enlighten the child's mind and give them a taste of the human form of language. There was never intention for the video to explicitly teach babies multiple languages, but it was made to introduce the sounds and rhythms of the beautiful languages of humanity. If you were a baby, you wouldn't be able to tell between and words of any languages, all you would want to do is listen to them and watch along with a parents who's pointing out the visuals like a video blackboard. This video isn't a method to make a child brighter, it's a tool that a parent has to work with in order to let your child start understanding the world early. Interacting and talking about the video to your little one can be the most enriching for their mind. If anything, it's a better thing to let children watch than any of the loud jumpy kid shows on television.",1443052800,2,986,4.483333333333333

And I gotta tell ya-I'm not really one to purchase used items of any kind, but since these videos are so dang expensive, I decided to try an alternate route and buy ""pre owned"" movies that are listed by well-rated companies and I swear to you I've saved a lot of money with this one trick! I highly suggest you all do the same. There's some very reputable companies out there that sell these movies for a heck of a lot cheaper.",1433289600,3,548,4.228571428571429

Slip this in on a bad afternoon and the music and images captivated and calmed my toddler.  I have to say I even find it calming.  Do I recommend setting your child in front of this all day?  No, this was something we watched together on bad days or before nap time.  I also highly recommend Baby Bach.  These two DVDs were true life savers.",1421798400,2,461,4.2298850574712645

Discovering Water and World Animals are pretty close.  I wish they had more music in them, but the girls seem to like them.  One positive is that there is a repeat play option on Discovering Water and World Animals.  One negative about all of the Baby Einstein videos is that they take forever to begin; which is frustrating when you are using them as a calming tool.  I'll still buy more though.",1309910400,2,570,4.320754716981132

I am not sure why so many review for Language Nursery are showing up here but I just wanted to clarify what I was reviewing.

I got this for my son well over two years ago.  He loved fish so I thought that this would be fun. He loved it and still does now at the age of three. My 1 yr old loves it too.  They love the music and the shots of the water.  The puppets are entertaining and they love to watch the kids on the video play.  They love to sit and watch the aquarium part on the bonus features and it is a great way to calm them down.

I would highly recommend this video especially if your child likes fish and water.",1280361600,,662,3.8666666666666667

He sits in his sliding glider with a bottle of water or juice and watches the dvd. He isn't passive, he's talking back to the images and lauging. After this he slips off to nap. We've used Baby Bach, Baby Monet and now this one since he was about 4 months old. (We watched the signing video before he was born and since.) These videos are fifteen minutes for mom or dad to make it to the restroom or just relax. And you don't have to worry about what he's seeing or hearing.",1247443200,,600,4.181034482758621

1226362,5,B00000INEV,"Before buying the complete DVD set, I bought this Baby Einstein DVD seperately.  Both my girls, under two, love it.  Of course, water is very soothing regardless of your age, but the way Baby Einstein puts it together with the classical music, slow images and puppet shows it really is great to help the kids calm down rather than wind up if they watch TV.  Certainly one of the better DVDs of the set, in my opinion.",1179014400,2,417,4.3896103896103895

1226377,5,B00000INEV,I can't believe he likes these already but he does. My son is two months old and he gets through about half of this video. That is pretty good for a two month old! I didn't think he would sit through it this young; but I tried it one day out of desperation when he was fussy and he settled down and watched it. He does sit through the whole Baby Van Gogh video. I think he will like this one better as he gets older and can comprehend what he is seeing. I think it's great. He loves his Baby Einstein music CD's too. I recommend those too...,1158451200,,541,3.9724770642201834
1226378,2,B00000INEV,"I bought this one on used VHS at a consignment store, and would not have paid more than $3 for it. Once again Baby Einstein has a great idea and misses the opportunity to make something both fun and truly educational. The visual quality of the video is beautiful, and the puppets are cute, but its not educational. Whoever designed this video did not have a solid understanding of how children learn language. This is a major flaw with BE products that are supposed to be educational, but they do a poor job with concept development. For example, they only pair word and visual image once per segment. This DVD has a loose structure, for which each segement is meant to help a child develop concepts of various forms of waters--rivers, oceans etc, but the makers failed to align images, words, and puppet shows in such a fashion as would allow someone who had no experience with these things to develop a working understanding of what features make a river a river, or an ocean an ocean. Many of the images selected seem to have almost nothing to do with the chosen theme of a segment, or are related in such a way that only an adult or older child who already has a working understanding of the topic would understand. Same goes for the puppet shows. They tend to involve humor or situations that are far out of the realm of a pre-verbal babys experience. I wish Baby Einstein would bring in psychologists or educators when they design their products. Buy it as something you can put in to soothe your baby, but don't be fooled into thinking you're educating them. They will learn much more in the bathtub or pool.",1156982400,10,1615,4.534246575342466

That said, this movie never got or held his attention.  There are no interesting sounds or music.  The voices are very monotone.  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it?  The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said.  I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures.  If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool.

My husband & I both ran into the living room, backed the DVD up, and sure enough, it was pretty funny!  Now, he laughs at all the puppet skits throughout the entire DVD.  THIS DVD ROCKS!!

Who would have ever thought scenes of water would engage a baby (we have a 9-month-old) and show so creatively. There are scenes of geysers, waterfalls, rain, puddles, waves, lakes, and streams. As well as children jumping in puddles wearing raincoats and whales and dolphins diving in and out of the water. Then of course the Baby Einstein puppets play with water by watering gardens and playing jokes on one another.

My daughter absolutely adores all the animal Baby Einsteins, so I was glad to find one of a different concept. These dvds have been a lifesaver to me for my highly active baby (aren't most?), who can barely sit still for a few bites in her high chair nor before naps and bedtime. She eats a meal now and falls asleep peacefully to the videos. Then they are excellent background music during play times.

I was ready to throw it out, when I just showed it to him again (19 months). He clings to me and once the goldfish is gone, he is fine with the video... until it reappears.

Baby Neptune is downright boring. They show the same things over and over, like the same ocean scene.  I think overall the Baby Einstein series is over-rated. I could put on a better puppet show myself using the toys in my living room. I think a lot of folks, including myself, were intrigued by the catchy ""Baby Einstein"" name, because we all want to raise little Einsteins. I'm sure the folks at Baby Einstein are laughing all the way to the bank! I haven't seen some of the other titles like Van Gogh, Numbers Nursery, Shakespeare, etc., so I don't know if these are any better, but with all the money i'm out on Vol. 1, I won't be giving Baby Einstein another chance.

My 10 month old daughter is just fascinated with this dvd, I've actually replayed it several times in a row for her while she was teething, because it was the ONLY thing that would make her smile!

I think that the imagery is perfect for kids of any age.  It's simple with a stark background, sure to hold a baby's attention.  When you have too much going on visually, it can detract from the learning process.

I will admit, the same as another reviewer that I did, at first, double check my language settings when I heard German with no English translation.  The songs, number counting, and rhymes are soothing, and I find myself anxious to watch the dvd with my little one.  One reviewer commented that we, as parents can't figure out what is being said.  First of all, when WE learned our native lanuages, we didn't always have a ball in front of us when someone said the word.  This is how we learn the language.  And just because us parents may not be able to translate a German nursery rhyme, doesn't mean that hearing it is entirely lost on our kids!  And it's not too difficult to figure out the difference between the German alphabet and 1-20 in Japanese.  (use your fingers, if you need to!) I've learned both from watching this video, and rekindled my love of foreign languages.  I am now studying Japanese and German, and already speak French, English, and Spanish.

It sometimes worked better than getting dressed and driving around at 4am to finally get her to sleep! Oh god, those nights were just rough! The DVD is just great,educational and fun. the real life footage of sea life, the puppets, the music and the little kids all add up to 25+ minutes of soothing down time for little ones and parents. Helped sooth us to sleep sometimes faster than our daughter! ha ha! Recommend for all new parents. Our 21 month old still enjoys watching it and now asks what each object or animal is.

1226436,3,B00000INEV,"This would have been a two-star video, if I hadn't discovered the ""Aquarium"" segment in the bonus features. The main video manages to be both jarring and uninteresting to babies (and adults). There are some gorgeous scenes of sea life and flowing water and of course the toys. The scenes flash too quickly to engage even an infant, though, and the entire production is reduced to brain candy. Not nearly as well done as the pre-Disney videos produced by Julie Aigner-Clark. But if you skip directly to the Bonus Features, there is a segment called ""Aquarium,"" which consists of longer, more fluid clips that for some reason ended up on the cutting room floor. These clips are anchored by two lengthy scenes of a diver feeding aquarium fish, which captivated our 11-month-old and our 6-year-old alike. The longer, less ""teachy"" scenes are more evocative of the magic of earlier Baby Einstein videos. In my opinion, the music selections are better as well. So, feel free to rent or buy this video for your little one, even if an over-produced puppet-and-kid show isn't your cup of tea. Don't be dismayed when the main feature leaves you cold, though.

Now that my son is two, I use it for quieter moments, because it might not catch his attention for long periods if he is too excited.

It was so different then most of the Baby Einstein videos that show toys and spinning things.  This one actually shows beautiful real live video of things in nature such as dolphins, waterfalls, waves, zooming above the ocean, underwater scenes, etc.  It shows water in these catagories: Water In The Oceans, Water At The Beach, Water In Rivers & Lakes , Water In Raindrops & Puddles and Water At My House.  This video actually has cute puppets (I usually don't like the Baby Einstein puppets).  I could still do without all the toys and spinning & rocking things (they still have some of that in here). My little girl (about 17 months at the time of first watching this) laughed when the puppets came on and she liked when they showed the baby.  One really great feature on the dvd is the Aquarium found in the bonus features.  It shows a diver under the water feeding fish.

The languages covered in this product are:  English, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish and everything is spoken by a native of that language.  All the speakers are women.  A word of caution about the video.  It breaks my heart where, at the end, the little girl is reaching for a toy and her mother says, first say peek-a-boo [for the camera].  I really think Julie Clark's children have been a little exploited in this product and that snippet of conversation is very telling.  I certainly wouldn't show it to a child.

Our little girl is infatuated with the puppets, especially the turtle and duck, and this Einstein actually has more puppet scenes than the others for her age group. I can't see how this can't rate well among what else is available at this age level. Definitely worth the cash for the repeated giggles and smiles.",1109721600,,659,4.454545454545454

1226525,3,B00000INEV,"Language Nursery is my son's (& my) least favorite of the Baby Einstein videos. Although several of the reviewers below are mistaken in saying that there is no way to know what's being said in the various languages (the inside cover of the video lists each segment, and tells what language is being spoken and what is being said in each segment); the main flaw of this video is not connecting the visual images with what is being said.  For example, the video has the numbers 1 through 10 counted off in each of the different languages, but the images being shown have nothing to do with numbers or counting.  Similarly, the alphabet is read in each language, and the poem ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" is read in several of the languages and simple, appealing video of the letters or object starting with each letter, and images of a twinkling star could easily have been used instead of the random, unrelated footage of, say, Julie Clark's hand dropping objects into a shape sorter.
  I think the idea behind this video is wonderful & I was very excited about getting this tape.  Some of the reviewers below seem to misunderstand the intention of the video, thinking, it seems, either that the video was supposed to teach their baby foreign language or that it would be all in English so their English-speaking(?!) baby could understand it. However, the premise of this video is based in solid psychological research on language development: repeated exposures to the sounds of foreign languages very early in life makes it easier for children to learn those languages *later on.*  This video isn't trying to teach your children Spanish or Hebrew or Russian -- merely to expose them to the sounds of these languages as spoken, importantly, by native speakers of those languages. Unfortunately, this particular video is boring, and gives nothing visually to connect the sounds to (which would help parents learn the foreign vocabularly to continue repeating for their babies).
  A final negative of this product is producer Julie Clark's egocentric choice of herself as the native speaker of English. The sound of her voice is irritating; and she has a fake-sounding delivery that could have been avoided had she hired a professional actor to do the English reading.",1100217600,7,2269,4.906005221932115

I thought it was boring and so did my friend's 1 year old daughter because she fell asleep.  Since I have a 3 month old, I thought I'd purchase the Language Nursery to expose my daughter to other languages.  I would think that as the other languages are being spoken, there would be some English subtitles.  I know the video isn't supposed to be teaching me foreign languages but what good is it if you keep hearing different languages but are totally clueless and to what is being said.  My opinion is that these Baby Einstein videos aren't going to boost my child's IQ so I won't be adding any more to my DVD collection.

However, after several attempts, she decided that the duck, octopus and turtle were lots of fun - oh and the water stuff is kind of interesting too! Now it's in the rotation with Galileo, Van Vogh and Shakespeare. And I'd change my rating to 3 stars, but I don't seem to have that option at this stage.",1095811200,12,544,4.3431372549019605

We popped it into the DVD player and she instantly started jumping up and down in glee! Dancing to the music, pointing out the animals, even naming a few (at 13 months, no less!). Even at this point, she still enjoys the video, nowadays shaking her head when she knows one of the characters in it is about to do something silly ...

My wife and I couldn't have been happier with this DVD. In my opinion, it is the best of the ""Baby Einstein"" videos. It's really the only one that I can watch (for the umpteenth time) and not be bored to death with - in fact, between all of the ocean and other water scenes, I find it somewhat calming.

I'm not a big TV person and feel a little guilty about putting him in front of the tube, but the B.E. videos are an almost perfect compromise.  Baby Neptune gets the most airtime.  Some of the scenes feel a little rushed (blip they're there, blip they're gone) and it's barely 30 minutes, but there are no commercials, the music is wonderful, I love the ocean scenes and the aquarium is a peaceful bonus.  We got them when our son was 6 mos (now 1 yr) and I can't say he's riveted, but he does enjoy it and has a great deal of fun playing with us and the puppets.

I wouldn't say this one is educational, and I have honestly not seen how I could make the videos educational for my son because he doesn't want to pay attention to us when he watches this, he just wants to stare.

So anyway, baby neptune and beethoven crack him up because of the puppets. The duck is his favourite, he laughs each time the duck appears. He has shown a great interest in puppets since he was 7 months (I have a few puppets at home that we play with) so this DVD was the best thing for him right now.

I have to say that I am very entertained by the puppets too. I think the duck is very silly looking and very expressive.

For instance I thought that you would be able to change the language that was being spoken but you can't, the pictures go from one language to the next and you really don't know what you are listening to. It would have been better if you could change the language, that way one day you could listen in english the next in spanish and the next in french, etc. And  in order to get from one menu to another is a real headache, the instructions tell you that it can vary from one DVD player to another but still it's ridiculous. My sister-in-law has some videos of the other tapes and so we've decided to watch them first with our daughter before buying them. So if you don't have someone with the tapes just go to you're local video store and rent one before you lay down the bucks for one of these tapes. We have since gone with good ol' Sesame Street tapes/DVDs and the action in these are just what the doctor ordered, they are fun and our little girl loves to look at the screen with these.",1062892800,7,1223,4.226495726495727
1226696,4,B00000INEV,"We are relative newcomers to the Baby Einstein revolution. My twins were 15 months before we bought their first one - Baby Beethoven. We just recently purchased Baby Neptune and Baby Galileo.
This is a fine DVD with wonderful music, but it just doesn't hold the attention of my boys the way Baby Beethoven does. I begin to wonder if kids don't just attach to the first Baby Einstein video/DVD they get and that's always their favorite...
This is a bit shorter, and my kids seem to especially like the scenes in Beethoven with the kinetic toys, which are not as evident here.
Always keep in mind as parents watching the Baby Einstein series that the images are for the KIDS and not the parents - yes, I find them a tad boring, but the boys love them, and that's what is important!
I like the special features on this DVD, including the ""discovery cards"" and the cd-ROM coloring book. These are nice extras.
All in all, a fine video - and as I said, not my kids' favorite, but not the one they're most familiar with, either.",1062633600,10,1022,4.441489361702128

The packaging says ""nine months and up,"" but he already enjoys it so much.  He loves watching the tropical fish, dolphins, whale and sea turtle, and he giggles and tries to talk to the duck, octopus and turtle puppets when they appear.  We're thrilled, because we love water and hope he will enjoy it as he gets older as well.  The beautiful music and real underwater footage, combined with the darling baby and puppet scenes, make this a pleasure to watch --- even for Mommy and Daddy!

It's clear that different hands are at work on this title -- which followed the sale of the Baby Einstein company to Disney -- and that they don't necessarily understand how BE works.  The music is as good as ever (thanks to the long-time personnel in the ""Baby Einstein Orchestra""), but the visuals are a mess.  Earlier titles would show a scene and stick with it for a while, and transition between similar scenes, for example, from one toy to another, or between different views of the same toy.  This video madly intercuts between toys, nature footage, and pictures of children... completely missing the simpler approach of earlier titles.  The puppet shows are more elaborate, but are they any more charming?  No.
To its credit, it's not larded down with obnoxious and intrusive advertising like other Disney titles, but overall you'd still be better with the earlier titles that Julie Aigner-Clark and her people were directly involved in.",1061164800,27,1102,5.032967032967033

We took the video to his private day-care setting and the kids there LOVED it -- even the older ones!  Now, it makes a regular appearance in his diaper bag.  They lady he stays with during the day just raves over this video in particular, and we have a few in our collection.

He gets so excited when he sees the green FBI warning, knowing that one of his movies is beginning.  He watched the first few minutes of Baby Neptune and then started screaming.  Instead of the lovely music, shapes, and colors like other Baby Einstein videos, Baby Neptune has real life footage -- children playing in a puddle  of water, a whale jumping out of the sea, etc.  Definitely not so exciting to a four month old.

She especially enjoys the ducks, the puppeteering with sound effects, and the kids brushing their teeth.  I have already bought her another in the series to see if we can interest her in it too.  Disney did a great job exploring different types of water, activities using water, and animals that live in water.

No annoying scenes of Julie's children trying to be cutesy (something that was a problem in Baby Bach), and plenty of ""action"" that keeps baby intrigued. I didn't find the frequent change of scenery bothersome, more importantly my baby didn't seem to have a problem with it.
The music is enjoyable as usual, the puppets were fun to watch, they even brought back the silly duck with the red scarf that was featured in Baby Beethoven. It's great to see your baby recognize the characters from previous releases.
There were children interlaced throughout, but nothing like Baby Santa or Baby Bach. You can tell Disney is trying to fine-tune the videos / DVD, and they did a good job with this one. This has a great balance of beautiful scenery, fun and silly toys, and nice music. I give this a thumbs up.",1053993600,14,864,4.580645161290323

We had to put our groceries away and do a few other things, so I decided to put her in front of this video in her bouncy seat.  I was amazed! Her eyes stayed glued to the television the whole time and she was captivated by it.  No, the pictures don't correlate with the words being spoken but I don't think that was the goal.  I think the goal was to capture babys attention while exposing them to other languages.  She laughed and cooed and shrieked all the way through this video and began to cry when it was over and I picked her up.

Baby Neptune has beautiful film clips. I watch it with them and have to admit this is my favorite. Very peaceful in some scenes (the waterfalls and beach scenes are lovely. It also has a more professional look that the earlier ones, such as Baby Bach. I enjoy World Animals for the same reasons.
But I have to admit, neither Baby Neptune or World Animals grabs my kids like Baby Bach/Mozart. They know the scenes from B. Bach by heart and mimick the sounds of the puppets and toys. Not so with Neptune. They also loose interest and play with other things earlier in the film. Maybe it will grow on them in time.
I have noticed that their interest is also influenced by our conversations during the videos as well. Maybe I talk less to them during B. Neptune. Could it be so pretty, too relaxing that it distracts me from the babies (haha)?",1051488000,6,1016,4.438502673796791

While the theme is clever and it's a neat concept, this one did not seem to have as much attention grabbing music and viewables as some of its predecessors.
Since my daughter is now 9 months old and loves to play in the tub, I thought this would be a big hit.  She does enjoy Baby Neptune and will continue to watch it, but it's not as 'wow' as I thought it might be.

1226809,2,B00000INEV,"We own every Baby Einstein DVD and we were excited about this new one, having recently visited the New England Aquarium. Last night the family gathered to watch ""the new movie."" (We severely restrict our son's access to TV; the Baby Einsteins are a much-anticipated treat for him.) My 19-month-old son sat on Mom's lap.
We expected to see what is on every previous show this company puts out. Folks who are fans of the Baby Einstein series may already know the ritual opening. First comes Julie's voice over an all-white screen with words, and she welcomes us to the Baby Einstein series. The sounds of the ""Baby Einstein orchestra"" is warming up in the background, then a gentle skit or other intro preceding the title.
We pressed the ""play"" button. First the screen fades black. Then a loud anthem sounds and a 3D digital castle appears, with firework sparks shooting from left to right and back again. It's a 3D Tinkerbell! More music, more sparks, more pyrotechnics, and BAM! BAM! BAM! it's over. This is Disney announcing with Great Authority that they produced this show, with lasers and computers and God knows what else.
My son literally shrank back in his seat during this and started to whimper.
Then the show actually started, and guess what the first image is? A bright orange puppet of a fish, ZAPPING from one side to the other with a special digital sound effect. SWISH!!! It's gone. (This is a theme. Remember the gentle toys moving from left to right to connect scenes? Amp it up, baby!) ZAAAAP!!!!
Mom later told me that my son had actually dug his nails into her forearm, almost to the point of bleeding.
The opening montage and, indeed, the whole show, seems paced for children much older than the range on the box, and it seemed much louder than the others. There is a prolonged zooming helicopter shot of a coral beach, for example. (Ouch, said Mom. Her arm again.)
After the opening, I stopped watching for enjoyment and started to watch for signs of other differences from the earlier installments. Plus I kept an eye on my boy, and he rarely seemed to lean forward with interest and excitement. He spent a lot more time shrinking from the screen, turning away slowly, and pinching Mom.
There are quite a few differences from the previous DVDs; I really can't tell whether the current producers ""get it."" One mainstay has been an adult hand ""playing"" with a common toy. For example, placing rings on a stacker, or dropping balls through a toy castle, or opening the doors on a busy box. It is slow-paced and there are amusing sound effects. One sequence from this DVD that stands out in my memory was a collection of magnetic sea animals. First there's one. Then POP there's two. POP. Three. POP. Four. And so on, till a heap of magnetized, connected toys have filled the screen.
Why not show the hands putting this together? How does jazzing up this very simple staple make the show better?
On only a single viewing, I was able to notice that several ""live"" shots were reused, especially the vertiginous helicopter flight.
My final rating is what it is because there actually are worse ones in the series. But parents, be forewarned: with Baby Neptune, Baby Einstein has jumped the shark.",1049241600,11,3213,4.688495575221239

1226812,5,B00000INEV,"Well... the Baby Einstein Company has done it again... yet another top notch video to add to their collection. I have been a die hard Baby Einstein fan for 2 1/2 years now, as my twins are that old! Although the video is rated for ages 9 months and up, I am confidant that a smaller baby would love the visuals here. Baby Neptune is all about water. From the ocean, to rivers and lakes, to tub time, to a jaunt in the back yard with a garden hose, to tooth brushing time, Baby Neptune's got it all. There is even a section on beaches that covers sand castle building, and some exploration in a tidal pool. The ""hosts"" of the show are a turtle and duck - the same line of bath puppets used in most of their other videos. There is minimal computer animation here, which is a typical trademark of the Baby Einstein Company, who promotes the ""real world object"" theory that kids relate best to things they know and see in the world around them. There are children throughout the video, and as one other reviewer so rudely noted, I don't think they are offensive to watch! In fact, I don't believe that any of Julie Clark's own children are even in this video. That is a shame, as my son has a major crush on Aspen and Sierra! The children that are present here only add to the personal and ""real world"" feeling of this video. There are also various brightly colored toys intersperced into the video for added visual affect (think Baby Mozart). The show is choreographed to a wonderful selection of stimulating yet soothing classical music, so it's easy on parents' ears if your child chooses to watch it 10 times in a row! For extra fun, there is an aquarium bonus feature (DVD only) where you can watch a nice man feeding a bunch of fish in the Colorado Aquarium. I give this 5 stars..you just can't loose with this one.

I did notice some of the water scenes with the pupptets looked digitally enhanced . . . simulated water? But I did like the real life segments quite a bit.  The music was well done and not grating on the nerves like a lot of other videos that are not in this series.  We still think Baby Van Gogh is the best.

My son was not as thrilled to view it, personally I think they should have added more puppetry than computer graphics.
I could have even dealt with seeing Aspen and Sierra (who, by the way are not in this) than I could deal with spotting the ""hidden mickeys"" or the not so subtle shot of Epcot.

The older she gets the more certain scenes will delight her. This is our new favorite. It immediately catches her attention by showing stuffed animals at the beach, before the opening credits. It continues on in various water play and delights her when a game of peekaboo is played.....her favorite game to play with us. It is brighter and more entertaining than the rest. The series improves with each video. I'm only sorry I didn't get the DVD. The repeat play feature is a godsend.  I have numerous videos from this series and her running fave was Van Gogh until we got this one. I'm definitely glad since I was tired of that one already. My daughter is 5 months old now. The age recommendations have never mattered since she enjoys even the ones labeled for 1 year olds. I would definitely recommend this one for mothers.

As she was having a fussy spell when we got home, we immediately put it in and watched her grin ear to ear when she saw/heard the Einstein bug coming!  Definately for the 9+ month old child as Baby Einstein suggests ... but extremely cute.  We are big fans of the new Baby Beethoven DVD - but Neptune is a great one too, also more educational.  My husband and I previewed it with my daughter over dinner, and were totally amazed by the footage of the marine life (we are both scuba divers).  Cute turtle and octopus puppets as usual and for those who don't like the videos with Julie Aigner's kids (why I am not sure), as far as I saw, they're not in Neptune.  There are more chances than ever to teach toddlers things in this one too, its one that is enjoyable to watch with your baby - the marine life is fascinating - very clear photography.  Only downside was the DVD menu that plays the same song over and over, which will drive a parent nuts.  The bonus material has an ""aquarium"" of a white haired scuba diver feeding fish and closeups of marine life which was really cute too ... more teachable moments (lobster, underside of an octopus, sea horses, things I never get to see diving!!) and other great animal footage!!  I have loved Baby Einstein products since my daughter first watched them at 4 weeks old, and I think toddlers will enjoy Neptune a lot.  Great way to teach them to appreciate marine life they may not get to see until they are older.",1047945600,17,1638,4.358552631578948

1226849,1,B00000INEV,"I had heard great things about the whole series of these video's, so I purchased this one...unfortunatly.  It is just a bunch of foreign language babble...I would have thought they would have at the very least, had subtitles so the parents could explain to their children what was being said.  The pictures on the screen didn't even correspond with what was being said (I know this from when they would talk in English).  At one point they were counting in different languages and taking away blocks...but they would only take away 1 block for every 4 or 5 numbers....would be real confusing for a child learning to count.  We didn't even watch the whole thing...only made it about 15 minutes through and my daughter hadn't even so much as glanced up at it...not to mention my complete disapointment in it.  If I were to do something of this nature I would have, for instance, showed a picture of a horse...and said the word horse in all the different languages...that way you know what is being said.

I'll put him in front of the TV in his exersaucer or playpen and I can get the things I need to get done while he's watching. Baby Einstein is especially good because it introduces him to sounds that he will need to learn different languages that he will not pick up in his everyday surroundings. I've tried other brands of ""baby oriented"" videos and he doesn't like them at all, but I pop a Baby Einstein video in and he's entralled.",1036281600,7,553,4.226415094339623

She enjoyed it with the same enthusiam as her brother did.  At 9 months I decided she needed some more of these videos...some variety.  I selected Baby Einstein next.  I really didn't compare it to all of the others before purchase...I wish I had.  We enthusiastically put it in and my daughter did not react as enthusiastically as she always had with Baby Mozart.  The language was boring in comparison to all the music and unique sounds on Baby Mozart.  Immediately we purchased Baby Bach and my daughter was delighted!  We alternate between Baby Bach and Baby Mozart, which are similar, but different.  Ocasionally I will put Baby Einstein in for a change of pace.

The video was just the thing I needed to get her calm and happy for such a long stretch.  She was fascinated with the colours and the singing, and it made me feel a part of it to be able to sing and talk with the lady on screen, knowing 5 of the 7 languages myself.  Never have I seen an infant react in such a way at such a young age.  I can only hope that the other videos in this series are as good, because we were both impressed by this one.

I applaud the courage to try this concept in America, and I believe it started a whole new trend in baby videos. I thank Julie Clark for that, although I with my youngest, I've foregone an introduction to the Baby Einstein videos after trying them with my 2 year old.
I also don't believe in putting children in front of the television at the suggested age group.  An infants eyesight doesn't develop until 4 months old, and this should have been taken into consideration in its making and marketing.  With all the newer videos that just came out, like the Baby Know-It-All series (absolute favorites for both toddlers) and Bilingual Baby's more targeted language associations, I find that Baby Einstein is not a great buy.",1011571200,18,905,4.751592356687898

He went through periods of obsession with ""Buzz"" and ""Tubbies"" and ""Bluey-Ooo"", and I almost retired the Baby Einstein ilk, but they keep coming back into favor and will soothe him back into good humor when nothing else has worked.  They also soothe ME-- when my nerves are shot and the cartoons are driving me nuts, I can put on one of these and enjoy the classical music.  I like Baby Einstein over the others in the series because I really do believe in the value of early exposure to foreign language.

I was very excited to discover this particular video, especially after being VERY impressed with the quality of Baby Bach and Baby Mozart. Unfortunately, my 7-month-old just isn't interested in this video. He absolutely LOVES B-Bach & Mozart, but this video just doesn't have the same fast-paced, attention-grasping quality. Having said that, I must add that I do love the fact that it exposes children to various languages, and although it isn't visually stimulating, having it play for the auditory component is well worth the investment. 4 stars!",1009670400,10,682,5.04424778761062

It has also been very useful at times when he's fussy and can't get comfortable we'll put this in and he sits, relaxes, and watches it.
I read some posts criticizing the quality of it, and yes, to an adult it seems pretty stupid and we will care more about timing of music to action.  But, to my son and other babies we know, they just love it!  This is a good one to start with in the collection.  Baby Mozart has a couple of parts in it where it may frighten the baby because of the loud noise and the puppet going ""BLAH"".

1226908,5,B00000INEV,"This video is the absolute favorite of our little boy.  We received Baby Einstein as a gift, and were skeptical of its claim to be developmental or educational, mostly because we were not sure that a video for infants could be educational.  Our opinions were soon rendered irrelevant by our boy's fixation with the film.  He loves it!  When he was about four months old, we started letting him watch it, and from the first moment he was enthralled.  From the first viewing onward, he watched every moment, including the introduction at the beginning and explanation at the end, with rapt attention.  It annoys him if we move across his path of vision while he's watching Baby Einstein.  When he's upset it calms him down.  When his Mom needs to do something, like take a shower or put in a load of laundry, this video keeps him entertained.  We did not choose Baby Einstein, our little boy did.  We're not sure whether the theories about keeping his mind and tongue open to the learning of foreign languages are correct, but everything in this video and all of the videos of the series seems wholesome and potentially developmental to us.  In short, he loves it, and we think that the content can only help his development.  He is totally disinterested in any ""adult"" video like movies we watch on the VCR, but he adores his Baby Einstein.  We recommend it without reservation, and are now owners of all the videos in the series.",996364800,11,1429,4.623015873015873

1226910,1,B00000INEV,"Our daughter spoke her first 2 real words at the tender age of 5 months, and ever since then she has not looked back.
As you can imagine I was thrilled when I saw this video, along with Baby Mozart. We had worked a lot with playing different kinds of classical music to her, while in the womb, so I bought them both without hessitating.
However, the idea of the videos might be sound, but the content or rather the execution of those videos simply leave you with a lot to ask for. There are days when our daughter is scared when you put them on, but on most days she is simply not interested at all. And I can understand why. The quality of the video, is what you could have made yourself in an afternoon with your home video equipment and a few of your child's toys. For that I think they were quite pricey, not even considering the uninteresting contents.
By now we, as parents, have a good idea of what toys not just interest our daughter, but also stimulate her learning and exploring. This simply just doesn't have what it takes. You suspect a cynical business man behind it all, that wants to milk a few bucks off the whole movement of progressive learning. So take our advice, and save yourself a disappointment.

Julie Clark has chosen to mark this video from birth to eighteen months, but I disagree. My son did not take interest in this video until 9 months. He is now nineteen months and his interest in it has grown as he has gotten older. Although I consider Julie Clark a brillant woman for creating this video series, I think she should have used a professional voice-over for the American segments rather than her own voice. Her voice lacks ""umph"" and comes across as boring and unstimulating.

This video is very amateur-like in style and content.  Shame on the producers and manufacturers of this video for capitalizing on  the names Mozart and Einsten and for taking advantage of parents who  eagerly purchase these videos with the hopes of enhancing their children's  intellect.
