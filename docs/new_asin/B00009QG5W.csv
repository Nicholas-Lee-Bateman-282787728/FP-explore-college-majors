1888729,1,B00009QG5W,"This DVD came up as a recommendation when I was ordering other Pratchett DVD's, so I assumed, wrongly, that it was the recent BBC version of Terry's book finally released here and ordered it. I am very upset that I was wrong. Whoever or whatever is making the recommendations needs to get a clue. This movie is being returned unopened.",1293148800,2,335,4.6
1888730,1,B00009QG5W,"This is not Terry Pratchett's Going postal that aired on the BBC, this is a movie with Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond. That being said I have not seen this movie and am only giving this a one because it pops up in the terry prachett search. Hope this was helpful.",1292112000,9,274,4.288461538461538
1888731,1,B00009QG5W,"Once again, my mistake, I bought the wrong movie.  I wanted Terry Prachett's GOING POSTAL, not this ridiculous piece of crap.",1284768000,15,125,4.9523809523809526
1888732,1,B00009QG5W,"This movie is a total waste of time. It's slow moving. The dialog is drawn out and painfully boring.  Everybody is crazy. The movie lacks a much needed straight man to balance out the lunatics.

Orsen Starks (Brad Garrett) is a mailman on the brink of insanity. He whispers secret messages into a tape recorder, but utters not a word to anyone around, not his supervisors, not the local baker, not even his wife. He's afraid of lawnmowers. He refuses to deliver mail if someone's lawnmower is in their driveway. He duck tapes an arsenal of weapons to the inside of a blue USPS corner mailbox.

The postal management seeks the help of an expert to determine which employees might snap and explode into postal violence, as if Orsen's bizarre behavior isn't already a dead giveaway.

I'm shocked that some reviewers gave this flick a five-star rating. Five stars, my foot! Going Postal might appeal to pot-smoking dimwits who sympathize with Stark, but if you have more than a dozen working brain cells, don't bother with this stinker.  Absolutely nothing even remotely interesting happens until the shooting starts, and then it's so staged it's laughable. I just wanted the movie to end.",1256947200,,1185,4.846534653465347
1888733,2,B00009QG5W,"A rather flat movie filled with some misconceptions, flat acting, unconvincing camerawork, and a host of lies.

Two or three scenes hit right: management's micro management of an employee's breaks. But no one I ever knew would hole up in a bathroom with food coffee and a Penthouse magazine.  The postal lecture is correct. Bored employees sitting around looking at the ceiling.

I never saw a moving belt set up for carriers. This was a set up scene so one employee could get his hand caught in it. It's fake suspense. You'd have to put your hand under the belt to get it caught. All belts have switches and buttons that be turned off in several places.

Most of the film is monotonous, plodding towards the breakdown, involving an employee who's psychological profile would indicate  an unhealthy mental state, no matter where he would be.

The vamp who causes it all --from another station where they had killings--is transferred to another facility.

The sequences of trying to calculate what will happen is all bull pucky, and only pads a rather flimsy script.

The only time the film comes alive is when people start getting shot.

And the postal shootings of the post office were by and large caused by ex GI's with Vietnam  experience and delayed stress syndromes who were incorporated into management, who broke themselves and others by demanding too much and having little humanity and concern for themselves and others.

The film was initially called ""Post Office"" and the name was changed for the DVD. The USPS doesn't like the term ""Postal"", but they have to deal with it.",1213228800,,1585,4.8118081180811805
1888734,5,B00009QG5W,"Warning:  Anybody who takes this film in any degree of seriousness should definitely seek professional help!  This is one of the best movies that truly depicts what really goes on in the world of the postal service!  Speaking from my own personal experiences, I am a mail carrier for a small post office and know exactly what it's like working for them.  Watching this movie made me realize how utterly ridiculous, yet uber serious some postal employees take their jobs and use their status in the work environment to screw you over!  Take the scene where the clerk was in the bathroom longer than five minutes, and that says it all!  Brad Garrett from 'Everybody Loves Raymond' delivers an over-the-top performance as the crazy postal worker!  I had a blast watching this movie from beginning to end, and would highly recommend it to anybody that's affiliated with USPS to see it!",1196121600,,881,4.7947019867549665
1888735,1,B00009QG5W,"The ""Going Postal"" with Chris Alessi and Chris Caron is a very cute student film written and directed by Beverly Chase.  It won Best Short Comedy at the New Hampshire Film Festival.  It has no dark side.  It is the story of two friends and their quest and travels to purchase an old postal jeep.  Amazon has the wrong information about the movie they are selling called ""Going Postal"".",1175126400,,385,4.536231884057971
1888736,5,B00009QG5W,"This black comedy about a post office shooting by an emotionally disturbed employee is not just an atrocity story: it's a satire on post office policies and practices, made more powerful by very good acting. We see the stupidity of a bureaucracy in action in the hiring of a psychologist to bumble through the psyches of the employees, all the while doing more harm than good and finally succumbing to the disaster he'd been hired to prevent.

It's not  politically correct because post office shootings are supposedly too serious for comedies, but the director made it work for people who are not uncomfortable tackling unusual subjects. Although a low-budget film, it has the quality of a good major production.",1119657600,3,713,4.983193277310924
1888737,3,B00009QG5W,"Somewhat entertaining and funny.  I do not reccomend purchasing this DVD.

Anyway, I love this movie but it's not for everyone. My wife couldn't watch it. She left the room. It's classified as a dark comedy but when describing it to my wife, I told her it's a ""black"" comedy - very dark humor. She understood what I meant after she watched a bit of it.
