7826690,5,6302492653,"This movie is actually a soft-core porn movie in my oppinion. But the reason I gave this movie five stars is because of the GREAT storyline. This movie is about a late night radio show host, Nick West, who has women call in and give intimate details about their sexual fantasies. One night, things get carried a little too far and Nick wakes up at 1:30 or so in the morning in the studio, next to the dead body of a woman who he was having sex with just minutes before he went unconcious. The police believe Nick is the murderer, but Nick is racing against the clock so he can prove he didn't do it...or did he?? Rent or buy the movie and find out! The other storyline in the movie revolves around a seedy strip club and it's sick, volatile owner(Vincent Miccelli), played BRILLIANTLY by David Carradine. The way Nick gets mixed up with Miccelli and Miccelli's low-life world is very, very entertaining and suspensful. Carradine was sooo great at his part. One thing about this movie, there is a TON AND A HALF of soft core sex. For the best effects, watch this movie late at night!",1078876800,11,1082,4.415
