3782386,5,B001RXB4H2,"You will want to view this collection in small bites as it is packed with many of the greatest Loony Tunes. Dispersed and packed around these Tunes are commentaries by the creators, historians and contemporary critics.

For those of us that just like cartoons before they became so sophisticated that they no longer entertain but just make social statements. For people that are interested in history and history of the industry this collection is a necessary have. It is almost incestuous how the producers of the Loony Tunes turn up in other cartoons and TV programs.

I suggest you buy the whole series however; any one of the DVD's can stand-alone.",1239840000,22,652,4.864864864864865

3782415,3,B001RXB4H2,"First of all let me say, that we LOVE Looney Tunes. We bought this product for our kids because watching quality cartoons these days seems like a thing of the past. We grew up on these cartoons and still enjoy them as much today as we did as kids.

However, I'm so disgusted by the politically correct message delivered to our children from none other than Whoopi Goldberg about how harmful the stereotypes portrayed in these 50-year-old cartoons. Characters like Mammy etc, apparently perpetuate racial stereotypes, but we can't fast forward through her message and get to the menu to select cartoons, forcing us to watch her intro over and over. Can the PC police please leave harmless cartoons alone, and pick on someone their own size?",1500681600,2,739,4.818897637795276
3782416,3,B001RXB4H2,"Most of the cartoons are great.  We could have done without the very early Looney Tunes from the late 30's to early 40's.  Let's face it...Porky Pig wasn't that funny then and he is not that funny now unless he's got Bugs, Daffy or Sylvester in the cartoon with him.  Also could have done without the various so called classics (like Clara Belle the cow and a few cats who were not Sylvester along with one disc that was nothing but cartoons set to music in libraries and in Hollywood with the stars of the day).  And where are all the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons?  I counted three, maybe four at most.  We get a couple of discs out of 24 total with Road Runner, a half disc of Pepe Le Pew, an entire disc of Speedy Gonzalez (which...are pretty much all the same) and four Foghorn. That was probably the most disappointing thing about the collection.
The Good...well, there's Bugs, Elmer Fudd, Daffy, and Sylvester & Tweety (too many of those also, but at least they're funny).  haven't seen a lot of those in a long, long time so watching some of them was hilarious.  Most discs are dedicated to them. You get an average of 15 cartoons per disc and 24 discs in the set.  It is a good deal if you like the Looney Tunes.  But beware...I think these were all released as single discs previously.",1500508800,,1290,4.382352941176471
3782417,2,B001RXB4H2,"Very disappointed with this purchase as it contains very few of the best bugs bunny cartoons. While the set does include many it leaves out far more that should/could have been included from the best bugs years between 1950-1960. I feel this set was misrepresented and  overpriced  . They would not include the actual names of the cartoon shorts so that you must open the set to actually see what is included. If you love endless really old and not so funny cartoons from the 30's and 40's and the entire library of wile coyote and speedy Gonzales, then you shouldn't mind. Once I had a chance to see the titles included and found they were skipping so many of the classic bugs bunnys I returned it promptly. the seller refunds you less than half the cost you paid for ""re-stocking "" fees",1499040000,5,788,4.503496503496503

3782437,4,B001RXB4H2,"I ordered from eBay for $43 in 2016 thinking ""Oh what a great deal I just got!"" then I got it in 2017, and I was very disappointing, it came in a cheap bubble wrap package, but that's not the worst part, I tried to check if they were the real deal, because, as another reviewer pointed out, there are COUNTERFEIT sets out there, and this set, didn't play on my computer, when all of my DVDs to, so i put it into my blu-ray player, and the quality was so bad, and, when ever I skip Whoopie Goldberg's introduction on Vol 3, it goes right to the first cartoon, WHY?! - So I contacted the seller and he gave me my full refund, I now ordered straight from Amazon.com (the seller, no third party sellers) and it's arriving tomorrow. I will give you all my big review to tell you if this is the real deal or not.

How to tell if you have a counterfeit: Check the packaging, make sure it's the right tint, anything darker where you can barely read the text means it's a fake set. Check the discs, compare them to actual golden collection DVDs to make sure they're not faded or brighter. Check the cases, all the cases in this set have 2, 2-disc trays so you could read the episode guide without having to remove a disc. Lastly, check the DVD quality and see the about of space on the discs IF they are able to play on your computer.

UPDATE: It came in the mail today, and yes, it was the actual dual-layer DVD set!! All the discs match my 2 other volumes I own and the art and everything is real. The disc quality is also so amazing compared to the fake set. Order from the seller Amazon.com, then you know you'll get the real set! Even though my cases (the disc trays are fine along with the DVDs and box) came damaged, I could easily replace those soon!",1484352000,4,1749,4.171597633136095

3782461,3,B001RXB4H2,"I originally started searching to buy this 6 volume set at another web site. But after I saw many reviews from people receiving counterfeited discs. I thought by paying nearly 3 times as much on amazon.com would keep me safe -- whoops -- wrong!

The discs I received are not burns, and came in beautiful cases in a beautiful box, all sealed in plastic. But that only goes to prove the counterfeiters has the ability to produce stamped DVDs, print pictures on paper, and own a case wrapper.

To discover if you've been scammed and unknowingly own a counterfeited copy of this box set, all you have to do is run a test or two:
1) Read the DVD cover, search for the format the disc was produced. I happen to know that this box set contains ""Dual-Layer Format"" discs throughout. And to back that up, the (counterfeit) cases (still) read ""Dual-Layer Format"". But when one of the suspect discs is inserted into a computer, the computer clearly shows the discs are Single-Layer format. In fact, the largest disc in this counterfeited set is 4,684,418,752 Bytes. Well under the maximum a single layer disc can hold; which is, 4,707,319,808 Bytes. The the original discs in this box set are 5.69 to 7.88 GB each, which requires Dual-Layer discs. So if any your discs from this box set are less than 5.69 GB -- then you are looking at discs that are Counterfeit!
2) Every Warner Brothers DVD I've seen is encrypted. Which is true for the original discs of this set, they're encrypted. Both the original and counterfeit DVD cases carry the ""Copy Protected"" logo but the counterfeit discs inside are not encrypted. I just took the suspected counterfeit disc 2 of Volume 1, put it in my computer and copied the VTS_01_1. VOB file to my computer and it plays fine-- which is impossible to do with encrypted discs. I'm not running any special software that decrypts discs so.... counterfeit! (.. and yes I removed the test .VOB file)

Me, my discs havel the above symptoms plus my first my volume 1 discs show up as being from a box set consisting of Volume 1-4.

I used VLC to take a screenshots of the same frame from the opening scene of ""Hare Trigger"" on Volume 6 disc 1. The better looking of the two came from an original dual layer, encrypted disc, and the other is of the counterfeited discs I received. I matched the frames exactly, and used VLC's Interactive Zoom tool so you can see the degradation without having to put the image on your big screen to see the difference. An additional note, the pictures were taken in png format so these pictures do give accurate representations of the actual video.

I'm not trying to rain on unknowing consumers parades; fact is, I am supplying information I would have liked to have read before making this purchase.

Once I informed the seller of my information, the seller quickly issued a complete refund and took down the product. So I'm going to give the seller the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, as for the rest of you selling this box set, if you don't run random checks, you are leaving yourself open for a huge law suit that will stress you for the years it will drag on. If you choose not to check, you still have made a choice.

And yes, I'm still in the market for the legitimate dual layer disc set. I just don't know where to turn.",1471910400,49,3290,4.500837520938023

The quality of the remastering and restoration is excellent and there are tons of special features, including extra cartoons, in each set.

Secondly, only a fraction of these have made it to Blu-ray and they may not be worth any extra money, as they do NOT look that much better compared to the DVD's. If you have an upscaling Blu-ray player, they will look about the same.

Thirdly (and sadly), it is my understanding that Warner Brothers made between 800-1200 Looney Tunes cartoons over the years. After 6 collections, each containing 65 (actually more because extras were included as bonus features, so over 400 were released so far), they stopped making these collections. The collections released afterward on Blu-ray contained hardly any new material and mostly these same cartoons repackaged into smaller collections. They seemed to have stopped producing those as well. They should have continued with the Golden Collections, one per year (or more), until all the original cartoons were released.

Fourthly, each of the Golden Collections contains some great cartoons and fan favourites. However, each collection also contains a lot of dull ones too, some are included for historic purposes. It would be great if they had let fans request their favourite cartoons and then make collections based on the most requested cartoons... all restored and remastered, of course. If people stopped collecting or sales for successive sets had dropped, it is likely that people got fed up with paying for 65 cartoons but only likely half of them.

Prices vary and change, so keep checking in and it may go cheaper. Buying this in Canada on Amazon via a third party is significantly cheaper right now. In America, the prices of each of the 6 individual volumes varies a lot, from $15-$35.

Regardless, these collections offer a LOT of material and are now quite a bargain at a fraction of their original price. If you have not collected all the sets before, grab this set NOW while you still can.",1470528000,,2219,4.906666666666666

The uncensored Looney Tunes will be on my shelf, in the original form, when my kids or I want to watch them.  As big as this set is it only represents about 1/3 of the total Looney Tunes complete library and therefore a lot of great cartoons were left out.  For now though this set is as good as it gets and we can only hope they will make all the the Looney Tunes available at some point.  One huge complaint would be that they disabled the skip function on the Whoopi Goldberg introduction.  Forcing people to listen to her at the beginning of every single disk seems like some sort of twisted punishment.

For example, individual discs are devoted to particular characters.  So, if you want to pop in a disc and let it run, you'll end up seeing 7 Speedy Gonzales toons in a row.  Or, 9 straight Road Runner toons.  The viewing experience would be so much better if the cartoons were mixed as originally aired or in chronological order.",1453766400,7,500,4.892857142857143

It's fun to see them crunching carrots and saying ""what's up Doc?"" Plus I've seen them all so I can let them watch without worrying about content.

 so far (box1,discs 1-3) theres little to complain about and alot to enjoy.the only consistent downside was the commentary and interviews which i found dull and often drawn out too much(editing!!).there were some interesting bits there and others may find them of interest.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: after viewing more of the set I discovered many, ultra boring Bosco b&w cartoons.a poor Mickey mouse imitation it could have and imo, should have been left out as it severely detracted from both the enjoyment and value of this collection. Way too much Bosco!

Also one of the Porky/Sylvester toons had the entire middle sequence taken out, about a three minute segment. Gone with no explanation.

Whoopi Goldberg makes an appearance on volume 2 as a non-skippable intro giving the old ""you know folks used to be racist back in the day"" which is unnecessary due to being patently obvious.

3782585,5,B001RXB4H2,"This is a great collection of classic cartoons. I grew up watching Looney Tunes as a kid. I loved every cartoon I saw as a kid, but soon, Looney Tunes was seemingly gone. When my own kids were old enough, I searched high and low. The only channels we could find classic cartoons on would require an upgrade to our cable package at a steep price increase. I purchased another set in the past, but it came unexpectedly having less than we were hoping for. So my search continued until I found this set. I am not sure how I missed it previously when I looked, but I picked it up when it went up as a daily deal. I immediately snatched up a set for our family. It's been a couple months now and I have to say, we have thoroughly enjoyed watching these old familiar ""faces"" together as a family. There are several discs and *so* many cartoons to watch. I don't think we've quite watched all of them yet as there are so many.

I kept in mind that this was not a complete collection as that was not what I was hoping for. I got a really good deal when it was on sale, and I think even for the current price it's a good bargain. I would definitely buy again. My kids love it and they're getting to experience these amazing cartoons some of their peers have never even heard of.",1423526400,3,1269,4.158536585365853

I thoroughly enjoyed the selection of Looney Tunes in the collection, which includes some of my all-time favorites! I grew up watching these on Saturday mornings, so they are old favorites and the nostalgia is strong here.

There are long, detailed reviews available here on Amazon if you care about specifics like which cartoons were included (and which were left out), the quality of the individual films (which can vary, for good reasons), and the possibly sensitive nature of some of the films from the 1940s and 1950s. Judge these films by their time and enjoy them in all their brilliance, or skip them if you are the type to be easily offended by what is currently considered to be politically incorrect. If you're that type person you won't enjoy these cartoons.

If you can appreciate the art form, understand the culture in which they were created, and love Warner Brothers cartoons, you can't go wrong with this collection. It is not absolutely inclusive of all the Looney Tunes films made. How could it be at this size and this price? What it is is an excellent representation of many many fantastic cartoons, including the operatic masterpieces starring Bugs Bunny.

3782625,5,B001RXB4H2,"Including bonus shorts, the box set of all 6 volumes of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection contains 375 shorts totaling at over 36 hours, plus over a full day worth of bonus features, as the box says, all in single normal-sized DVD cases, if you haven't gotten them and wanted to, AND wanted to save shelf space compared to the single bulky sets. My set was at an unbelievably low price of $54.54 tax-free with free fast shipping, from eBay! Somehow, all 24 discs are single-layered with my set, and in LP mode, or in close proximity to it, to handle all the contents, but they all play just fine; that's how my Angry Beavers DVD set was made and sold, as with my cousin's Princess and the Frog DVD. But I digress, each and every volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, is a treasure trove of classic restored and uncut Looney Tunes shorts, including shorts that aren't televised anymore from Bob Clampett or Tex Avery, any shorts at all predating 1943, or from numerous toon stars like Speedy Gonzales, Beaky Buzzard, the Three Bears, Hubie and Bertie, Sniffles, one-shot shorts like that of Michigan J. Frog, etc., etc., plus a huge amount of bonus features, both old and new, from the WB's vaults and from toon experts and legends in Hollywood (via commentaries and documentaries)! It's a definite crying shame that the legendary toon expert Jerry Beck pointed out that the WB doesn't have any more moo-lah to restore any more Looney Tunes shorts that haven't been on DVD before, after the 3rd Platinum Collection came to DVD & Blu-ray last year, so it sounds like it'll be a cold day in ""the bad place"" before we see EVERY Looney Tunes short ever made on DVD, restored or otherwise. I'm awfully sorry to have to break this to all of you who are reading my review on this already-extensive and prestigious, prodigious collection. Just read other reviewers' reviews on this collection and you'll get an eyeful, and a better idea, on all the contents on this set, both the main attractions and bonuses! But just to warn you, the 8 Spotlight Collections (including the Movie Collection, which caused a volume 3 Spotlight Collection to be non-existent) are meant for everyone as the 6 Golden Collections... aren't; they're meant for grownup collectors, as many of the shorts contain characters from other countries or of commonplace-stereotypical attitudes or behaviors, like Speedy, Pepe le Pew, and especially Bosko, as well as WW2 propaganda shorts like Russian Rhapsody, Plane Daffy, Herr Meets Hare, Daffy the Commando, and especially the Private Snafu shorts made in association with Dr. Seuss himself, and MANY others. If you're a grownup collector of the Looney Tunes shorts and/or any other toon on DVD, you won't be sorry with this humungous 6-in-1 Golden Collection, no matter how much it costs!

Heck, I have found myself practically shoving my boyfriend out the door so I can go watch Looney Tunes. While I do wish that this collection contained all of the cartoons, it is still more than adequate. I see the vast majority of the cartoons of my childhood here and what is not here I found in the Superstars collections and some public domain collections. There is so much to view here that I can't tell what is missing so I don't understand why some reviewers low rate the set because it is not EVERY SINGLE Looney Tune. We probably never saw them ALL anyway. And wouldn't recall if we did. I also disagree with the reviewers who make negative comments because they think the cartoons are not child appropriate. If they would learn the history of these cartoons they would know they were not originally designed for kids. I grew up watching these cartoons in the early to late 70s and so far have not been influenced to drink, smoke, shoot anyone, push people off a cliff or drop an anvil on anyone.

3782673,1,B001RXB4H2,"I own the original, individually boxed Looney Tunes Golden Collection sets and have compared them with the discs of this set.

These discs are just over 4GB each whereas the authentic discs are over 7GB each.

The appearance of these discs are flat and translucent versus the opaque, high quality relief printing that you will get on the original discs.

Many times these discs will have trouble playing properly (as noted in at least one review here already).

The quality of this set is typical of Asian bootleg operations - very elaborate but, ultimately FAKE .

Many Amazon buyers have purchased this set unawares.

Warner Brother sells sets the Loony Tunes Golden Collection Vols. 1-6 on their website however they do not come as a box set as purported here but rather as a set of six individual boxes.",1413590400,39,807,4.76978417266187

3782684,2,B001RXB4H2,"''Golden'' collection? More like Bronze or Silver. Although WB made a great job restoring many shorts and including a ton of bonus features, The number of shorts missing from this collection is staggering. In fact, there are more missing shorts than there are available! Of the 1039 Looney Tunes cartoons produced, only a few hundred are included here. None of the TV Specials or Movies are included either.

Warner Brothers tried rectifying the situation when they released the blu-ray edition, entitled ''Platinum Collection'', and although there were many more shorts included in that collection, some shorts from THIS collection were ommited. Thankfully, WB also released more DVD sets later on, which included a ton more shorts. So for buyers, if you want to come as close as possible to owning EVERY Looney Tunes cartoons, I would suggest buying the following sets, on top of the ''Golden Collection'' set:

-Looney Tunes Platinum Collection
-The Essential Bugs Bunny
-The Essential Daffy Duck
-Porky Pig 101
-Looney Tunes Super Stars Bugs Bunny: Hare Eztraordinaire
-Looney Tunes Super Stars Daffy Duck: Frustrated Fowl
-Looney Tunes Super Stars' Porky & Friends: Hilarious Ham
-Looney Tunes Super Stars' Pepe Le Pew: Zee Best of Zee Best
-Looney Tunes Super Stars Foghorn Leghorn & Friends: Barnyard Bigmouth
-Looney Tunes Super Stars' Sylvester and Hippety Hopper: Marsupial Mayhem

With these, you will own pretty much every single cartoon featuring the popular Looney Tunes characters we all know and love (Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Pepe Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester & Tweety, Wile Coyote & Road Runner, Taz, etc.) But even if you own all of the above, there will still be many shorts missing, however most of the remaining ones feature none of the titular Looney Tunes characters, so it shouldn't bother most. So basically, if you are a hardcore Looney Tunes fan like myself and want to come as close to owning every cartoon containing the classic LT characters, the list above is for you.

However, you would still be missing all of the compilation shorts featured in the TV Specials & Movies (which featured new bridging animation to link all the shorts together) along with the original movies and Specials which featured entirely new stories (which are: ''Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies'', ''Daffy Duck's Quackbusters'', ''Tweety's High-Flying Adventure'' and ''Bah, Hamduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas'' and the two half live-action movies: ''Space Jam'' and ''Looney Tunes Back in Action'').

In the 90s and 2000s, Warner Brothers also made brand new series based off the Looney Tunes, featuring many beloved characters in their own spin-offs. These included ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', ''Taz-Mania'', ''The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries'' and ''Duck Dodgers''. A show featuring the descendents of the Looney Tunes was also released, called ''Loonatics Unleashed'', and a later reboot called ''The Looney Tunes Show'' was released in the 2010s.

So, there you go, hope that clarifies everything!",1409702400,9,3027,5.269709543568465

3782686,5,B001RXB4H2,Seeing as I have not finished watching the entire set yet I cant give a complete review at this time.  No matter.  Initially I felt I had spent too much on a collection of old cartoons many of which I viewed as a kid years ago.  This collection is well worth the cost and then some. The inside the tunes and interviews with artists etc are a big bonus and just as entertaining as the cartoons themselves. We see Mel Blancs son talking about his dad and the voice he gave to many of these characters. Many of these cartoons do lean towards the adult which makes them that much more entertaining. Todays cartoons are much more visual and close to 3d but they simply do not have the inner quality that these 'old' cartoons have. Cartoon collector or not I cannot over recommend this set. As I said I am about half way through the set. You will get great collection at a price that may appear high but is not when compared to buying the sets seperately.  There are many hours of cartoon fun and history here and many laughs.,1409616000,,1020,4.296875

3782723,5,B001RXB4H2,"I've always loved those old cartoons! Most people don't realize that those cartoons were meant more for adults than kids. (When I received them, the package said something like ""for adults"")

Bugs and Daffy, Sylvester & Tweety, Wile E. Coyote & the Road Runner, Marvin the Martian & Yosimite Sam, and the rest are all here! There are a LOT of cartoons here, boys & girls!

Never much cared for Opera, but the Looney Tunes cartoons do it like no other and are very entertaining and funny to watch!

Not only will you get the ones you've seen as a kid, but also some that have rarely been seen. Some of them are from WW II, and some have only been seen once! (And for good reason, for some, since they were awful.)

On a routine, if not almost daily, basis, one encounters references in our culture to the Looney Tunes characters, and everyone is presumed--correctly, to my mind--to understand those references.

3782766,4,B001RXB4H2,"This collection has a great number of Looney Toons, In fact, its the best one that they have put out so far.  All of the Toons are unedited, so they will run in their original (not politically correct) version that was broadcast in the 50's, 60's 70's etc, unlike some of the other collections that they have released that are edited.

My one gripe about this collection is that it does not contain the entire set of Toons, there are a number of Toons that are left out for whatever reason.  Overall though, it is well worth the money, and very good collection.",1402358400,,561,4.427184466019417

3782774,4,B001RXB4H2,I love the Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies because they were made to be shown at movie theaters before feature films and were therefore aimed at a mature audience.  The dust intruding into the frames of many of these cartoons made me wonder what happened to the spotlessly clean originals.,1402358400,,289,4.78

3782780,5,B001RXB4H2,"Great price for this collection. I bought it for my 6 year old's birthday. I am passing the torch of great cartoon entertainment to him. My biggest complaint is seeing Whoopie Goldberg's face warning the viewers that some of the abhorent humor used in some of these cartoons may offend some people today. Her message offends me. Lighten up. They are friggin cartoons that depict behavior that was perfectly acceptable at the time (and still is today if you ask me and millions of others). If she didn't say it and point it out, my son would have not even questioned it. More BS political correctness. You cant skip the warning either. Got me very angry that it was even on there.

I recall seeing them at the picture theatres in the 1950's and continued to love them on early days of television in my home country of Australia. They are all there and what's more there are more I had never seen or remembered, and the behind the scenes and documentary specials contained on each of the DVD's. It's a fabulous presentation and will be treasured by me for years to come.",1402358400,,568,4.524271844660194
3782788,4,B001RXB4H2,"To be honest, I've not had the time (sadly) to watch the collection yet........ and I'm sure that a few characters I love won't be as prominent as I would like (the same for anyone familiar with them - just different characters) - but such wonderful cartoons can't be passed up - I can share them with my mother, educate children that not all cartoons have to be half-hour commercials for associated ""toys"", nor do they ALWAYS have to be stridently ""educational.""  I'm all in favor of educational programming for children, but I also think there's value in enhancing the currently diminishing vocabulary and ability to have a conversation/follow a line of thought - as opposed to just snapping comments at one another - and this selection IS educational in that regard, but it's VALUABLE because it's not forced education - it's sheer joy to become immersed in for a while.  And that's certainly more than true for adults too!  A buddy who was a GREAT fan of a particular science fiction show said that one of the characters saw a poster of Daffy Duck on the wall of a human's quarters - and asked if he was one of the gods of his planet.  The human paused and replied, "".......Yes, he's the God of Frustration.""  I hope there's a good amount of his delightful fits and sputters here..........In a very real way, I believe THEY are beneficial and ""educational"" in an increasingly ""cautious to be politically correct, often over analyzed and over ""therapised"" to inexpressiveness, yet addicted to violent video games and pseudo communication"" society pattern I have found disturbing for some time now.  SOMETIMES IT CORRECT TO BE ANGRY or FRUSTRATED AND EXPRESS IT - and seeing it done so entertainingly can only improve things in my opinion.  It's a sad statement - but I think these cartoons have more to teach about ""communication"" than much that advertises itself as such.  AND THEY ARE FUN.  LET CHILDREN BE CHILDREN for a while, and let adults re-visit THEIR childhood!  I'm so looking forward to these - and encourage those who haven't ever had the joy of seeing these to ""take the risk"" - they'll be richly rewarded!",1402358400,,2123,4.744565217391305

3782793,5,B001RXB4H2,"This collection is astounding. Sure, you can nitpick that it includes too much or too little of certain characters, but come on! The fact that a collection like this exists is pretty amazing. And there is so, so much in terms of extra material, so if you're more than just a fair weather fan, then you have something really special here. The amount of material basically ensures that this set will have ridiculously high re-watchability. I think there is something, like, two or so days worth of video crammed into this set. It'll be like binge-watching something on Netflix but you don't have to stream it.

Full disclosure: I bought this on sale here at Amazon for less than $50 so maybe the super generous price clouds my judgement.

But I doubt it. This is an amazing set. If you can get it for less than $150 then you ought to do yourself the favor.",1401667200,,854,4.503225806451613

My children have been enjoying them just as I did when I was their age. I was concerned at first because my children are so used to modern Disney and Pixar cartoons that this might not interest them but they absolutely love the characters. I'd definitely recommend this set.,1400889600,,435,4.7368421052631575

3782798,4,B001RXB4H2,"Like other reviewers, I wish WB would release a definitive collection of everything.  Until then, this is probably the best option available.  The most popular cartoons are included.  Everyone should be able to find something they like.  My 2 personal favorites, ""I Like to Singa,"" & ""What's Opera, Doc?"" are here.  Discs are organized by general theme (such as featuring a particular character), not chronologically.

Extras are fewer than your average modern DVD set; but still quite impressive considering most of the people involved in creating these cartoons are now dead, and things like behind-the-scenes documentaries were rarely thought of at the time.

WARNING!  Watch these cartoons in moderation!  If you binge-watch them in some misguided nostalgia trip, you will never get that theme song out of your head!",1400457600,,820,5.294573643410852

There wasn't even room for a 6th set in the slipcase. At least Amazon is sending a replacement (in up to 2 weeks!) and provided labels to print and use. Maybe by Independence Day I'll be able to write a complete review.,1400371200,,397,4.306666666666667
3782801,5,B001RXB4H2,"If you're not a collector, and you're wondering what to think about all the reviews here of letterboxing and omission of 2/3 of the Looney Tunes library, just know this: these are serious concerns for a dedicated fanbase, but, if you were a cartoon enthusiast and you let that stuff influence a purchase, you would have known about this set before now. I'm not a hardcore collector, and I can say, just taken on its own merits, this set is as good as it gets. They couldn't have kept this quality of restoration if they had restored every single Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies ever made, and the cartoons on the set wouldn't have been of the same quality as what we have here. One occupational hazard of comedy is that not all jokes land, and I think Warner knew that when they were thinking about what to restore.

So even though not comprehensive, what you get here is still a massive 40+ hour collection of diverse animation that will set you up with animated shorts for years to come. Warner is asking $150 for the whole set, which is really not bad if you compare what's here with what the competition offers. Instead of doing limited releases and making us cough up $50 for each decade of each character like Disney, Warner wisely decided to diversify every collection, with four different packed discs for each of the six volumes. The discs usually feature a character or pair of characters, and this flow of characters in and out keeps it interesting, giving you some less well-known cartoons and off-the-wall one-shots as you get further along. The fewer cartoons you skip because you don't recognize who's in them, the more pleasant surprises you'll stumble on, after having been eased in with the Bugs Bunny-heavy first discs.

Just consider that you have a limited amount of complete box sets to gorge on in your life. Also consider that animated short films are just some of the best minute for minute entertainment ever made, and that for the medium, the best of Looney Tunes is as good as it gets. ""They don't make them like they used to"" is usually just a red flag for a baby boomer about to trash modern music, but I'm 22, and in the case of Looney Tunes, even I can see that they literally don't make them like this anymore. No one these days pours blood, sweat, and tears into storyboarding and hand-animating a cartoon - the money just isn't there. And after the painstaking restoration job, they look even better than they did their first night in theaters. There's a real warmth, concentrated style, and showmanship to these shorts that you don't get with automated TV animation, and you don't even really get in a feature length animated movie, where minutes drag with musical numbers that you kind of feel like fast-forwarding through. After watching for a while, you get the sense that the people behind these cartoons were putting on the best show they could with every feature, and the best of their 30 solid years of work has crystallized into this collection.

To avoid further rambling, that's all I'll say. Buy this set because real hand animation has gone the way of the dodo, and there won't ever be anything else like Looney Tunes.",1400284800,5,3167,4.651785714285714

I am not sure how much better they would be in HD due to the nature of the original artwork.  Sound quality is good, but it does not really take advantage of 5.1 sound, but then, the originals didn't either.  I enjoy the extras as well, as they frequently bring in folks who were involved in making these little treasures.  Compared to the Spotlight Collection series (I have one of those) the cartoons and display quality are the same, the main difference is that the corresponding Spotlight disk does not have any of the extras that are on the Golden Collection disk.

It has all the regulars like Bugs, Daffy, Sylvester, Tweety, etc. No tune is left out, though other are represented much more than others. I didn't do a hard count but there's probably about 100 Bugs Bunny shorts on this set so if you're a Bugs Bunny fan this set is definitely for you. There's also a ton of Sylvester and Tweety shorts as well as a whole disc dedicated to Speedy Gonzalez. Porky Pig gets a lot as well and most are in original Black and White which is a nice touch. There's also all the most famous one-shot cartoons in this set. Now this set is almost perfect if it weren't for a few things. Namely a whole chunk of great cartoon and characters are not well represented. Let's start with Foghorn Leghorn. He's missing a ton of great cartoons as well as Pepe Le Pew. Daffy Duck also isn't very well represented here considering the amount of shorts he's in. He's only got about 35-40 shorts in this set out of his 130+ cartoon library. One thing that Warner did that's almost unforgivable is they left out the two most important cartoon character debuts. Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck's debut is not on this set which is ridiculous. They are the most important characters in, perhaps, Warner Bros. history and you don't include their debut. Why? Makes absolutely no sense not to have Porky's Duck Hunt or Porky's Rabbit Hunt in this set. This is the biggest thing that irks me with this set.

To release all of the shorts on DVD yes all 1400+ in this format, it would take another 17+ volumes-assuming of course we have 60 cartoons per volume-this is only 6-all that has been released so far as the ""complete"" golden collection. WB could have continued with this series for the next 10-15 years-to release of them.

So, what do we have here? Well the best way to describe this collection is a comprehensive survey of the best cartoons. IN fact, some of these cartoons are so political incorrect that they thought that it was necessary to include a disclaimer beginning with Vol. 3 with the Whoopi Goldberg intro-replaced after that with the onscreen text version of the same message. Which I think is a bunch of BS. The part of the stereotypes that are presented-these stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong today. And to present them edited would be the same as claiming these stereotypes never existed. Hogwash! The real reason why these cartoons are being presented uncut is that PEOPLE DEMAND IT!!!!! They want these sets to sell-so they are complying with the demands of the public!!

The first three volumes are mostly Bugs Bunny, road runner, daffy Duck and other well known characters. The last 3 volumes show more of the Black & white-such as Bosko and Buddy cartoons-and other 1 shots. Daffy, Elmer Fudd, And porky pig transited into color-Bosko and Buddy did not-they were discontinued with the advent of color. It is really fun watching the early cartoons.

Special features? There are too many to mention. WB certainly spared no expense in regards to special features. Some of it Archives and some of it is new, but it is all very good.

I already had the first 3 volumes-but purchased this set instead-because after doing the math, It would have cost me more to get volumes 4, 5,6 individually than buying this set!

So get this set-you won't regret it. Buy it for what is-but if you don't get it because it's not complete-then you are robbing yourself hours of pleasure.",1387756800,16,2266,4.741116751269035
3782848,5,B001RXB4H2,I bought this collection a while ago to introduce my daughter to some good cartoons.  I found that she loved them as much as I did as a child.  We have thoroughly enjoyed watching them together and wouldn't give up the collection for anything.  Today's Amazon deal is great - $59.99.,1387411200,,283,4.509803921568627

3782851,4,B001RXB4H2,"This is the ultimate collection of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoons for any cartoon fan to have in their library. I purchased mine from ebay for $49.99 The cartoons are excellent, however, there is a problem with Volume 3 (hence my 4 star rating). Reason being, in this third set, the Porky and The Pigs DVD, which is disc 3, does not have the Porky cartoons that it is supposed to have. Instead, the cartoons from disc 2 (Hollywood Caricatures and Parodies) are repeated on the 3rd disc. I'd like to know if anyone else is facing this issue as well on Golden Collection Volume 3.",1385769600,,582,4.5

3782853,5,B001RXB4H2,Hubby loved Looney Tunes so I got this collection for his a few months ago. He hasn't watched all of it but the ones he has seen were just as enjoyable to him as they were back when he was much younger. Great collection if you love all the Looney Tunes characters.,1383177600,,264,4.096153846153846
3782854,5,B001RXB4H2,"Packaging is standard - cardboard construction, printing on all sides. It has a slipcase and stands on its short end. No problem.
Discs are round, and shiny and plain on one side, full cover illustrations on the other. Typical. Go figure.

Sylvester spits. Bugs, is fundamentally not really the best role model in the world. Porky still stammers. And both Speedy Gonzales and Pepe le Pew are very blatant comical representatives of the Mexican and French stereotype. But I've watched them for years and only yell ""Arriba!"" when I'm running very fast, and ""Let us go to the Kasbah!"" only when my wife asks me to speak to her in French. The set is lousy with Tweety Bird and The Road Runner, and I'm not that crazy about birds. But this is okay because Wile E. Coyote and Granny are there, too.

So, the set very definitely has some issues. But you don't have and never will have a singular voice actor like Mel Blanc. You will never have a shack in the middle of a studio lot churning out 24 pages/second of drawings by some of the best illustrators and cartoonist ever working. Take that Simpsons, Disney! You may or may not have the convergence of genius directors again. And you certainly won't have the stories and the music like this anymore. Ever. But that's okay, too, because we have this massive set.

Finally, you'll make your children and grandchildren very sad because the will watch these shows and come to understand just how awful the cartoons they have available to them are. So, help the children! Get this for the children!!",1382745600,13,1541,4.637362637362638

If you are thinking of buying the volumes individually like I was to see if I wanted more, I would not do that, and I'm glad I didn't. You save a lot of money with this collection.  There are 24 discs and once you watch one, you will want to watch more (and more and more).  I also bought the ""Giant 600 Cartoon Collection"" for $13 and that is a steal.

3782865,2,B001RXB4H2,"Time/Warner seems to consider every cartoon created to be golden.  I personally do not.  For me, the golden years started after WWII and extended into the early 60's.  The decade of the 50's were the true golden years.  Given the huge number of shorts created in the 30's, in some cases entire discs, this collection is less than golden.  There are 15 shorts per disc and on some discs the first 12, 13 shorts date from the 30's and the remaining two/three shorts are classic shorts from the 50's.  Nobody is going to watch a DVD for only two or three cartoons unless the DVD player accommodates multiple discs.  What I wish Time/Warner would do is just publish all of the Looney Tunes cartoons by year, in the order that they were created and be done with it.

The late Mel Blanc had an amazing gift, and it's on display in many of these early cartoons of Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Daffy Duck, and the rest of the Looney Tunes gang.  Some of these, having been produced decades ago, lack the political correctness of more recent times, but so far I've seen nothing that should be considered beyond the pale.  All I can say for sure is that they can still bring forth belly laughs from a nine year old, and there's something very right about that.",1372636800,,579,4.443396226415095

3782876,4,B001RXB4H2,"I know, that's for Cocoa Puffs. The truth is, when I was a kid, I would get myself a bowl of Cocoa Puffs and watch my Looney Tunes. These cartoons actually improved my vocabulary and introduced me to opera and classical music. Okay, opera didn't really take hold for me but, I have a great appreciation for classical music, the artists and history. Cartoons helped me want to learn more about many different things.

Although I love my cartoons, Looney Tunes in particular, I can only rate the entire product 4 stars because there are many of my old favorites not included as well as the packaging is rather cheap and flimsy for a ""collectible"". I will say the viewing and sound quality are quite good considering the age of the originals.

I had believed I would be getting what is also included in the other collection based on these mixed reviews.

I was in love with most of the Sat. morning cartoons, except maybe the action ones. However, Bugs & such were my favs, along with ones like the Flintstones, etc. I was always wishing there was a way to have to watch whenever I wanted. Now that there are DVDs, I can't buy them fast enough (money is part of the issue). If they do eventually come out with anytime pay-on-demand streaming for all of those cartoons, the DVDs may become obsolete, but I hope not.",1368316800,,632,4.231404958677686

All the great 'toons I watched as a kid on Saturday mornings, plus some great additional features like commentaries, alternate soundtracks, etc.  If I had to pick something that I wasn't wild about it would be the political-correctness speech made by Whoopi Goldberg on Disc 3 - the printed disclaimer worked for me on the other discs.  Yeah, many of these cartoons were made when peoples' thoughts worked differently.  Racial stereotypes were more out there, not to mention some rather prominent depictions of the Nazis and the Japanese, after all, many of these cartoons were made during the war as an effort to keep the public's spirits high and support the war effort.  Overall, I'd say that about 40% of this collection were things I never saw before, likely due to p-c censorship.  Also, plenty of 'toons in B&W that I'd only ever seen after they'd been colorized.  Fascinating.  Great piece of history for any baby boomer who watched cartoons growing up.",1368230400,,1003,4.893491124260355

Additionally, I would have liked to see more of Tweety.

All in all, a good effort and a fun set.

One interesting thing is that whoever captioned this set didn't bother giving any characterization to the captions. That's disappointing as well. I'm sorry, but Tweety bird says, ""I tawt I taw a puddy tat,"" not, ""I thought I saw a pussy cat!""",1368230400,2,564,4.574257425742574

Now, when I put in a movie, I watch a cartoon first, which is the way theaters operated when I was a kid and for a long, long time.  So, in that respect, I'm reliving my childhood--and young adulthood, for that matter--but, in another respect, these cartoons still hold up.  They're clever, artistically done, and still funny.

It was a steep price at the time but you just cant put a price on such a treasure of superb writing and illustration. A time when you didn't have to tell the audience don't try this at home and jokes required whits. I will treasure this collection long into my old retired life.",1367280000,,446,3.966666666666667

I like that they have retained the original story lines, and dialog, and resisted the corrosive influence of the forces of political correctness, that enemy of free speech, thought, freedom and truth. They did feel obligated to include a mealy mouthed disclaimer / apology for what they referred to as attitudes of past times.

3782932,4,B001RXB4H2,"Let me start by saying that I am a longtime fan of these cartoon works of genius, and was eager to get my hands on each of these collections as soon as I could. That being said, I was kind of disappointed at what wasn't included in these six volumes (it's all down to opinion, some have other favorites than mine, completely personal choice, nothing more, nothing less). To supplement some of the omissions, I picked up two of the Superstar Collections: Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny (15 shorts not included here are on each of those)...skip the others (Sylvester & tweety, Foghorn Leghorn and Porky Pig) as they include material already available right here. Your other solution, if you have a DVR or DVD recorder is to program Cartoon Network's hour of Looney Tunes every weekday and save them. They're running a lot of the shorts that got left behind on these collections (like ""Rabbit Every Monday"" and ""Fair Haired Hare"" with Bugs & Yosemite Sam"" and some of the Sylvester and Son cartoons). All in all, these aren't perfect, but the remastering is beautiful and the cartoons are complete and uncut. A great start, if Warner Bros. will keep the ball rolling and release the rest of everyone's favorites.",1367020800,2,1204,4.710900473933649

3782943,4,B001RXB4H2,"I will start by saying at this point in time (Spring 2013) this collection is an amazing deal at around $100. Personally I already owned the first two volumes having purchased them when they were first released at around $65 each. I ended up not continuing past volume 2 due to price concerns. This complete set of all six volumes is absolutely a bargain at somewhere between $70-$150.

The cartoons clearly speak for themselves as the masterpieces they are, most people are familiar with the Looney Tunes so there is little need to discuss the cartoons themselves in a review. If you don't like the Looney Tunes I don't understand it, but this product clearly isn't meant for you.

Each of the six volumes contains 4 discs, and the set as a whole contains over 350 of the classic Warner Brothers animated shorts. While I have read several reviews complaining about individual shorts that were left out or certain directors or writers being over or under represented on the whole this is a wonderful overview of the Looney Tunes. Over 1100 shorts were produced and no not everyone can be included, but I think this set does a fair job of representing most characters, directors and writers.

One of the truly great things about this collection is the number of extra features. There are commentary tracks on many of the individual shorts, music only tracks on a number of shorts, interviews and documentaries with creators, historians and fans. Overall the bonus features on these discs are great and add a lot to the overall experience of the collection.

My biggest complaint is the packaging, but is a fair tradeoff for the current price. When originally released these collections were in beautiful foldout boxes with a great booklet detailing the shorts and special features included. Those cases offered great protection to the discs. The current set is packaged in slim cases with all four discs in a single case and no booklet. My biggest complain is the teeth that hold the discs in place are weak and break easily. When I received this collection there were broken pieces in each and every one of the six collections. This continues to be a problem. For me this is a fair tradeoff for the current budget price however.

Overall this is hours and hours of entertainment at a great price.",1365638400,3,2296,4.773299748110831
3782944,3,B001RXB4H2,"I'm not talking about the letterboxing used on the first two releases of ""Looney Tunes Superstars"". I have a complaint about this ""Golden Collection vol 1-6.  Even these 4:3 cartoons are too much cropped. They always miss left and right letters, Bug's ears' tips and feet, characters appears only half on each side of the screen, and sometimes visual gags are lost or puzzled on the four edges of the video image. Why don't they show the whole picture, as they did on VHS, and as it's been shown on Cartoon/Boomerang ?

I have to admit I haven't seen all of them yet, but so far this set of cartoons hasen't disappointed, so far I've only managed to see 6 of the 24 dvds in this package and I've loved every minute of  the looney tunes so far. I've already seen many of my favorites and yet I still have 18 dvds to go. Its worth getting this, you get Bugs Bunny of course, Daffey, Porky, Road runner, wile e coyote, not to mention a cast of many others. A must have for those that enjoy these characters. These are full length uncut shorts so nothing is missing, just the commercials. Hey, What's up doc? Looney Tunes Golden Collection 1-6 is whats up. Get it.

Just a short update, i've seen more of the shorts and boy if you like bugs bunny, your in for a real treat, I thought I've seen them all, but now I realize I've missed many. Simply fun and hilarious.

But another great thing, these are shows that we can sit down and share with our kids. The jokes, pranks, slapstick humor, classic lines and characters are simply tremendous! Mel Blanc , the voice behind so many animated characters, was such a talented voice actor (and comedic talent on old tv shows like ""The Jack Benny Program"". In fact to better appreciate this great talent you can go to [...] to get a full list of the wide range of voices he is responsible for, along with other projects he was in during his 50 plus year career.)

3782973,5,B001RXB4H2,I remember theese from when I was a kid and pretty well. I was just saying the other day that I cant imagine anyone not seeing theese cartoons. I have always liked Bugs Bunny Sylvester and Tweety Porky Pig Elmer Fudd Foghorn Leghorn  Daffy Duck PePe LePew Yosemite Sam the Roadrunner Wile E Coyote Speedy Gonzoles and a few others who are on this collection. Of course Woody Woodpecker is not but there are other DVDs that have him on it and theyll see him too if they order those like I did so its no big deal. Mel Blanc was a genious voicing theese people and its too bad he died so that other people have to. I was watching Space Jam with my brother and sister in-law a month ago and made the comment that the movie wouldve been better if Mel Blanc was still alive only to have my brother have to explain to his wife who he was. I was shocked there was anybody around who didn't know who Mel Blanc was. Anyway as I said the only person whos not on here is Woody Woodpecker but hes on a couple other DVD sets I ordered and you will order them too if you want to see him. Meanwhile theese cartoons are as funny as I remember them so you should get them. Every time Ive watched them so far I have seen at least one-probrably more accurally a few- that I remember from my childhood and ended up laughing anyway. You should get theese.

Considering there were 1001 Warner Brothers cartoons, this collection contains 35% of them. Each one looks brand new & is uncut, which surprised me, having watched badly edited cartoons on TV for the last few decades.

If I had one complaint, it would be how they appear on the discs themselves. By that, I mean the way they have an entire disc dedicated to one character. For example, in Collection 2, the second disc is all Road Runner cartoons. I found about 4 cartoons in, I was getting bored of them & skipped ahead until I found a cartoon that wasn't a Road Runner cartoon (there were a few on the disc). They should have mixed them up completely. But this is not a major flaw, so I'm still giving the set 5 stars.

Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and many others have made some really fantastic cartoons of all time. Yet, while so many generations have looked up to the Looney Tunes, many cartoon characters haven't been able to touch or duplicate the zaniness and joy that Warner Brothers has made for over 75 years of glee. But with so many people looking up to Spongebob Squarepants, and many other classics for this day in age, many people still have loved what has made classic animation so distinctive from many of these shorts that are still fun and enjoyable. Well, Warner Brothers has released the 6 previous Golden Collection volumes seperately. Yet, with Warner Brother putting the emphasis of these delights on Blu-Ray with the Platinum Collection, there are those that still don't own a Blu-Ray player and just want more. Well, it is all right here.

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volumes 1-6 are finally here in one package which contains 360 classic delights from Warner Brothers the Looney Tunes vault. The collection of shorts are still just as funny today as they were years and years ago. They ahve been remastered well, and include some really strong bonuses. The cavalcade of cartoons range from the distinction of Opera with the definitive What's Opera Doc? and The Rabbit Of Seville, to looniness from Daffy Duck like Robin Hood Daffy trying to proof to Porky, without losing his ego-tistical humor, to the thrills of the chase from Wile E. Coyote & the Road Runner, all the way to outwitting Sylvester thanks to the fastest mouse in Mexico, Speedy Gonzales. The collection remains strong and a great template to some of the funniest and greatest cartoons of all time. While some of them weren't fully remastered by their music sounding out of tune as they did when they first came out, as relevant from the first volume, but the other volumes each handle very well and offer fun for everyone. There are also some funny extras here including specials like Happy Birthday Bugs: 50 Looney Years, and vintage clips from legends talking about what made their direction of these gems funny including the legendary Chuck Jones, commentary from other voice actors who've worked with the man of 1,000 voices: Mel Blanc including June Foray whom played Granny and Witch Hazel, and many others.

All in all, if you had to choose between the Looney Tunes Playinum Collection for what its worth, and the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection Volumes 1-6, you are honestly better off buying this great package here. While I did wish that the classic Looney Tunes Golden Collection shorts could've included more cartoons from the loving skunk Pepe Le Pew & Foghorn Leghorn to just name a few, the collection is a better buy for your money. It definitely is the looniest collection that you're ever going to find for die hard Looney Tunes fans, or for anyone who is new to watching the zany fun that Bugs Bunny and friends have made us laugh with for all this time.

Fully Restored, Completely Uncut, Totally Looney!
The vaults are open and gold spills out: 56 top Warner Bros. animated shorts are now rounded up on DVD for the first time ever. Barely contained in a 4 solidly-packed discs, they've been restored and reasserted to their original, anvil dropping, laughter-inducing glory! It's a one-of-a-kind celebration of the golden age of Warner Bros. animation. One disc focuses on carrot crunching icon Bugs Bunny, another on the anarchic Daffy Duck and eternal strait man Porky Pig, and the other Two Showcase the rest of the Loony Tunes Gang. Extensively entertaining and encyclopedic extras will make your eyes pop and your jaws drop- just like being inside your own Warner Bros. cartoon. What's up doesn't get any better than this, Doc!

Volume 2 (2004):

Yes, here on4 discs you'll find 60 more of the finest, funniest BESTEST golden Era cartoons from the feverishly bent artistic minds at Termite Terrace. Disc 1 showcases a certain wascally wabbit. The happiness of pursuit is center stage in Disc 2 and 3's respective batches of Road Runner and Sylvester/Tweety fun. Disc 4 is an all-star cavalcade of Hollywood parodies and more. All 60 'toons are restored, remastered, uncut. And each disc is chock-a-block with bonus goodies. It's a 24-carrot gem of a collection. Anything less would be DETHPICABLE.

Volume 3 (2005):

You know what you want. More three-day weekends. More ounces in a pound of chocolates. More Looney Tunes. Your wish is our command.

Disc 1 features the tall, gray and haresome one. Disc 2 lampoons Hollywood. Ham actor Porky Pig rules Disc 3. And Disc 4 has the duck and a cast of crazies.

Volume 4 (2006):
More Looney Tunes!
Your wish is our command. Because in this 4-disc set are 60 more of the most looneytic Looney Tunes ever unleashed on rabbits, pigs, mice or cats. Indeed, some have never before been on home video! Disc 1 features the tall, gray and haresome one. Disc 2 is all pig. Disc 3 is all about Speedy. And Disc 4 is the cats meow. One thing: to watch these, you must be as tall as this sign. Wrong disclaimer. Read the one in the box below. Got the idea? Now have fun.

Volume 5 (2007):
Propelled by the creative genius of Tex Avery, Chuck Jones, and Friz Freleng, Warner Brothers' LOONEY TUNES introduced the world to some of the greatest cartoon characters to ever grace the animated cel: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzalez, Pepe LePew, Wile E.Coyote, Road Runner, Tweety, Sylvester, Marvin the Martian, Tasmanian Devil, and many more. This fifth volume honors Warner Brothers' golden age of animation with 30 more cartoon shorts remastered and restored to their original, uncut versions.

Volume 6 (2008):
Welcome back to their world, as fine a place as any to get away from yours, and a fitting, fun-filled, 60-cartoon celebration of the talents and zaniness of Warner Bros.' Termite Terrace. Disc 1 whoops it up with an all-star array of 'toons featuring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and more immortal Looneytics. Disc 2 features our heroes in wartime readiness. Legends Bosko and Buddy get their own long-overdue Warner compilation on Disc 3.

3782989,5,B001RXB4H2,"At this price, all of these cartoons, with extras and documentaries can't be beat!

This collection is NOT the release of every WB cartoon ever made featuring Bugs, Daffy, Wile E Coyote, and the rest, but most of the choices were definitely thoughtful or inspired.  I'm hoping future releases will be made, as there are so many more gems in the archives.  For example, ""Lickety-Split"" being one of the best Road Runner cartoons.  But with so many made, over the decades, it's quite probable that Golden Editions 7-12 will come out as the months and years go by.

Note: some of the cartoons are racy or racist.  That is how they were made.  I don't believe in censorship, since this is part of our past.  The past should not be forgotten as people would end up repeating it.  Plus, many jokes and gags are still hilarious.  I'd rather let individual viewers watch and decide for themselves.  Just seeing the disclaimer appear before the menus is fair warning, but most jokes don't come across as racist.  Particularly for the cartoons made after 1950. So, in a way, this is a time capsule reflecting peoples' social mores of the time, and it's interesting when these old cartoons are compared to those today.  What's changed.  And what's the same.

If you've fathomed buying any of 1-6 on their own, the moment you consider three titles, just get this box set instead.  You'll save money, and net a lot more material, with bonus features.

Either way, you can't really go wrong with this set.",1325376000,32,1491,4.673076923076923
3782990,4,B001RXB4H2,"I love the Looney Toons but have been apprehensive up to this point at the prospect of hunting down individual volumes of the golden collection. Thankfully my patience has been rewarded by this beautiful box set. It's incredible to have 350+ films together in one package. The box art is fun and the presentation of each volume is pleasing. See my pics and you'll see that they didn't skimp on the individual cases to each volume. They could have crammed the discs into smaller cases but they didn't. At $90 this is an incredible value, as each individual volume retailed for $50. The special features are very thoughtful and well researched and truly delve into the back story of the people who made this series as timeless and beloved as it is today. This is an absolute must for those who, like me, have waited for the compilation. If you have collected the individual volumes in the past there isn't anything new for you, however. My one little qualm is that the individual volumes are so tightly packed into the box that it is quite a struggle to get them out.

Update: March 27, 2012

It took me a long time to get through this set and after cataloguing and cross referencing every film heretofore collected, I have sadly come to the realization that this is NOT an omnibus. There are over 1000 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts that were made throughout the golden age. That means that this collection represents roughly ONE THIRD of all WB cartoons from the era. This set provides a little over HALF of the Bugs Bunny cartoons created, and he is the most well represented character here. We only get FIVE Foghorn Leghorn cartoons, and only THREE Pepe Lepews. That means that BOSKO the Talk-Ink Kid (anyone remember him?) is better represented here than Foghornn and Pepe. That is very disappointing. Now i understand there are a number of toons that WB refuses to release because of racial sensitivity, but that number is very small (11 to be exact). I also understand that there are additional DVDs outside this set that collect additional toons from the aforementioned characters. (like the superstar collections) However, the availability of these cartoons is far from comprehensive, with just under half of all toons available on DVD. The 1960s are especially neglected in this set. Only 18 of the nearly 150 toons from that decade are accounted for here. To make matters even more hopeless, WB has started releasing the Blu-Ray Platinum Collection, which feature not only the same toons we got in the Golden Collection, but FEWER FILMS PER VOLUME! That means the chances of us getting a definitive series even less.

I want to stress one more time that the toons featured in this set have been wonderfully restored, and likely represent the best of the bunch. All Oscar winners and National Film Registry entrees are in this bunch as far as i know. However is it too much to ask for to be given the option to choose for ourselves which films we want to pay for?",1325116800,925,2980,4.704980842911877
3782991,5,B001RXB4H2,"Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 1-6 collects all 6 volumes of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection (24 DVDs in total) into one package, at a very low price. I bought all 6 volumes separately years ago, and have been enjoying them immensely.

What you get here is a huge amount of cartoons with Bugs, Daffy, Porky, and Elmer, as well as a decent amount of Tweety and Sylvester, Road Runner, Speedy Gonzales, and Yosemite Sam. Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe Le Pew also appear, although they are underrepresented in this set.

There are also cartoons featuring more obscure characters such as Marvin the Martian, Tasmanian Devil, Hubie and Berty, Marc Antony and Pussyfoot, Chuck Jones' Three Bears, Witch Hazel, Michigan J. Frog, Owl Jolson, Buddy, Bosko, and many others, as well as some characters who were never named. Some of the cartoons here are old black and white cartoons from the early 1930s which I had never seen before.

Save yourself some money. Either buy all 6 items separately or buy one of the volume l-5 packaged sets which is currently l39 and then buy vol 6 separately (which is currently 4l) that = l80 (a l45 savings) from the price of this Vol 1-6 packaged set. Prices are constantly changing... so check carefully before finalizing your selection.

Caution... before choosing, make sure you are not getting the Looney Tunes Golden collection mixed up with the Looney Tunes Spotlight collection. These are two different sets. Also, make sure the seller has good ratings and is not some newbie. Also, make sure the correct separate vols are available so you don't end up with an incomplete set.

Do the math! Amaz0n is a bigger crook than some of these dealers when it comes to pricing. On DVD sets such as TV series, cartoons, etc. they are usually at least l00 do11ars higher than anyone else. It is deliberate because this practice of gouging has been a consistent habit by them.

Some of the DVD sets which they seriously overpriced were:

*this Vol l-6 of the Looney Tune golden collection more than l00 higher.
*Twilight Zone the complete original series... they jacked up the price by 75 do11ars ""While it was in my cart"" in less than 1 hour after I had added the item. 2 days later it was 90 higher.
*Alien Nation the TV movie collection was more than 50 higher than Bst Buy local store.

So... watch out on any packaged DVD sets from Amaz0n! Their pricing department is full of crooks! Take the time to price out the items separately or in other packaged sets combos.

Obviously, someone at Amaz0n is making a commission on this rotten practice! It is not a one time incident. This is a habitual practice and it goes WAAAY beyond acceptable profit margins. This legally qualifies for gouging as defined by the Fed gov't... like crooks who charge 6 do11ars a gal for gas during a crisis. If this was a dealer, they would have been kicked off Amaz0n for gouging like this.

Whomever is responsible for managing their DVD set pricing should be fired! Their boss should be fired as well... along with anyone else who knew about this crooked practice at Amaz0n.

3782996,5,B001RXB4H2,"The six volumes of WB cartoons in these set contain a total of 24 discs. After buying each volume, one at a time, I thought that I finally had a comprehensive collection of all the best WB cartoons ever made. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. Sorry to be a ""glass half empty"" guy, but a large number of memorable Looney Tunes classics were somehow left out!

There is easily enough good material to fill another 4-disc volume! I wish Warner Brothers went up to seven volumes instead of stopping at six. Seven volumes (of about 60 cartoons each) would have been the ideal number in order to include all the best.

The cartoons on this set all have superb picture quality, especially considering how old some of them are. (Compare some of the cartoons in this set with the same WB cartoons in cheap public domain collections and you'll see what I mean!)

In recent years WB cartoons have often been tampered with for TV broadcasts, for both ""political correctness"" (chopping out gags containing ethnic stereotypes) and ""violence"" (chopping out slapstick gags that involve explosions, gunshots, etc.) Every single cartoon in this collection is unedited and uncensored!

Also, I'm pleased to report that the cartoons that were originally made in black and white are presented on these discs in black and white; absolutely no colorized versions are included.

With so much going for this collection, I hate to nitpick, but if it were up to me I would have arranged some of these in a different order. There is a series of three closely related Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duck cartoons made in the early 1950's generally known as the ""hunting trilogy"", that involve Bugs and Daffy trying to outwit each other against Elmer Fudd. (These are ""Rabbit Fire"", ""Rabbit Seasoning"" and ""Duck Rabbit Duck"".) All three are included, but they're scattered across three separate discs. If it were up to me, I would have all three of these cartoons in consecutive order on the same disc, where each installment can flow neatly into the next.

Anyhow, for the benefit of those of you who have already bought this set and would like to be able to locate specific titles easily, I took the time to list the contents of all six volumes in alphabetical order. This list includes most of the bonus features as well as the main cartoons. Here goes:
