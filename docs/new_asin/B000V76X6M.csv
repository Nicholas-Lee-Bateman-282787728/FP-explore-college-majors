8216984,3,B000V76X6M,"It was nice to see one of my favorite bands perform live,  but this being an early show in their career was pretry rough around the edges. I hope they put another live dvd out soon so everyone can see how the band has progressed.",1380931200,,229,4.088888888888889
8216985,4,B000V76X6M,"Good performance, pre lust lust lust material. Interesting Gun club and Sonic youth covers.
Small venue and low budget recording, so don't expect and incredible sound and image. But still worth for long time fans.
Quite different live performance then, than post lust lust lust shows. There is no drummer, they perform as a duo, switching guitar, bass, drum and vocals.
There is no bonus material, such as videos, interviews etc.",1356825600,2,429,5.056338028169014
8216986,5,B000V76X6M,"good sound quality and good video.  nice to have a live show on dvd.  this is pre- Lust, Lust, Lust.  but they perform most of trademark raveonette tunes.  this danish band are quite unique and their sound is unmatchable.  every album is diiferent but great.  seems that their albums are kinda concept albums or created with a certain premise or guideline in mind.  this video will not disappoint fans and will generate new fans as well.",1221264000,15,437,4.671052631578948
