2828624,5,B000PXTRJW,"This is the version you want to buy if you're only looking for the English dub. There is no option to hear the Japanese voice acting, but this means you can save some money if you're buying the DVD to relive memories of watching Inuyasha on Toonami, like I was.

The quality of the voice acting is good, much better than many other English dubs around the same time; the dialogue is presented naturally and is one of the things that makes the series memorable. This speaks just as well to the efforts of the translation team, because a good script can allow the voice actor to use all of his or her talents to their full effect.

Each episode is divided into five parts for easy access: the opening theme; the first half of the episode; the second half; the ending theme; and the preview for the next episode. Of course, you can also watch without any breaks if that's what you prefer.",1278547200,2,885,4.390243902439025
2828625,5,B000PXTRJW,"then you basically know what you're getting product wise. But it's packaged so well-which is a big thing for me! I love well packaged things. Unlike the flimsy cases most box sets come in this is very sturdy and thick and glossy. I am a sucker for a good product! haha. So you know what you're getting when you order this, and you won't be let down when you recieve the item. Its worth the price.",1268179200,3,396,4.223684210526316

2828627,5,B000PXTRJW,"I don't know if I am the majority or not, since I have never read the reviews on InuYasha, but I absolutely adore the entire series! I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good anime, as I am very picky about what animes I watch, and this one stole my heart years ago. I own the box sets from season one to season seven, but have only watched up to season four so far. Rumiko Takahashi is absolutely brilliant!",1250726400,,410,4.1375
2828628,5,B000PXTRJW,"The title says it all.  Since the first time that I saw Inuyasha I was hooked and couldn't stop watching the show.  Other sets made it hard for my budget to buy episodes of the series, so in my opinion this is a great find.  This is one of my favorite seasons, and I can't wait for the English TV Version of the Third season.

This disks hold the entire 26 episodes of the second season of Inuyasha.  There are no subtitles or Japanese language track, but the English translation is enjoyable.

Each DVD holds about eight episodes.  The case its sturdy and wouldn't take too much space on your shelf.  To sum this up, For the price its well worth the buy.",1197072000,12,655,4.2682926829268295
2828629,5,B000PXTRJW,"it  has  been  called  many  things  fun,  awesome,  and  my  favorite ""Dragon Ball Z for  girls""  which  is  kind  of  true  but  this  series  is  awesome i  love  everything  about  it,  the  comedy  (this  show  has  great  comic  timing),  the  romance  is  really  well  done,  and  the action  is  epic  and  intense  and  fun, season  two  is  awesome  and  this  show  is  awesome.",1402444800,,390,4.333333333333333
2828630,5,B000PXTRJW,I thoroughly enjoyed the InuYasha series and would recommend it to any anime fan who isn't just in it for the robots and tech.  These stories were good.,1397433600,,152,4.428571428571429
2828631,5,B000PXTRJW,"This season introduced us to Koga, who would be a rival to Inuyasha for Kagome's affections and it introduced Naraku's incarnations, Kagura, and Kanna.",1396483200,,151,5.333333333333333
2828632,5,B000PXTRJW,Worth every penny.  This is an amazing anime and it is a good time to start collecting cause they just released some new stuff for it.,1391385600,,134,4.153846153846154
2828633,5,B000PXTRJW,"The DVD worked perfectly, I still own it (and the dust cover is still in tact) years later.  I love the show and cant get enough of it.",1382400000,,135,3.8214285714285716
2828634,5,B000PXTRJW,My order came fast and the seller was great! The discs are great and they are in great condition. I am really glad that I bought this box set it is amazing!,1360368000,,156,3.90625
2828635,5,B000PXTRJW,"I purchased this for my daughter and I enjoy it as well. It is not as complex as some animes (Durarara) or a simple as others (Pokemon)so it just right for my 11 year old. Inuyasha is about a girl named kagome Higurashi, an average ninth grader that gets pulled into an ancient well in their shrine by a demon. When she gets herself out of the well, bringing her 500 years into the past to the fuedal era, she finds a boy pinned to a tree by a sacred arrow. There she meets Inuyasha, a half-demon who seeks for the Shikon Jewel to make himself a full fledged demon. With Inuyasha and her new friends, Kagome's search for the Jewel of Four Souls begins.",1323388800,,652,4.224
2828636,5,B000PXTRJW,"i like it, came unscratched and in perfect working order, therefore i am very happy.  I just love the series and if you watch all of the episodes together you wouldn't even know when the seasons changed, everything is a cliff hanger.",1307318400,,233,4.5476190476190474
2828637,4,B000PXTRJW,"I got my order when they said it would arrive, and in great condition.  Would order from this company again.",1297123200,,108,4.4
2828638,5,B000PXTRJW,"Seriously, if you are an Inuyasha fan and you want it in English,get this version of the second season. I would highly recommend also buying the first season in the English TV version if you like this version. It's straight to the point, its cheap and I love it. Its a pity that the other seasons don't come in this version. This version has saved me alot of money.",1288656000,5,365,4.304347826086956

8193690,2,B000PXTRJW,I'm actually really disappointed in this product. I already had 3 other seasons and I'm looking to fill in my collection. I have the original thick box sets that have the fold out pieces for the dvd's and that's what I thought I was getting because the pictures was different from the other sellers. But it's all the disks in one little case. It doesn't match my collection at all! This seller could deffenently fix the discripyion to be more detailed and better pictures! Ever the cover looks like someone made a copy of the original on a copier. It's all fuzzy looking. I'm too afraid to open it because I don't want to be stuck with it!,1426204800,,639,4.423728813559322
8193691,5,B000PXTRJW,Thanks!,1425859200,,7,7.0
8193692,5,B000PXTRJW,"I'm going to sound like a broken record but, finish watching this a while back last year. And it really looks better than the tv series. This one like the first Two I bought is uncut so it's better than the cut version.",1424563200,,219,4.116279069767442
8193693,5,B000PXTRJW,bought it for my best friend and she loved it,1419638400,,45,3.6
8193694,4,B000PXTRJW,discs work perfectly. did not have a plastic outer casing for the set and the set was a bit roughed up. so 4/5,1417219200,,110,3.8260869565217392
8193695,5,B000PXTRJW,"This is EXACTLY what I wanted! I'm slowly building up my DVD box set collection. One shelf will be dedicated to the Inuyasha merchandise.
I'm having a hard time finding the English box sets that are NOT the repackaged seasons. One reason, I'm trying to match up the sets with the Season One box that I've had for years. The other being, it feels more convenient to have the seasons in three-disc format instead of five.
But of course, That's a separate matter.

For reference to others looking to replace their ""volume"" copies of the show, season two contains episodes 28-54 of the entire series.",1416614400,,596,4.6761904761904765
8193696,5,B000PXTRJW,"What can I say, it's INU YASHA! This has become my favorite Japanese cartoon of all time. The storyline is just enough supernatural and childish matters to make it very entertaining. My daughter still loves it.",1403654400,,210,4.861111111111111
