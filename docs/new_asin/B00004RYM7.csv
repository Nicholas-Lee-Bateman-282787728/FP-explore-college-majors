What I had not anticipated was that this would arrive without ANY subtitles. Since I don't speak German I'm not going to get much enjoyment from my purchase.

Another version (ASIN B0002JC5RU) appears to have been once available on Netflix, and that version had English and Chinese subtitles. Netflix no longer has it, so I'm pretty much SOL on that account.

I fault the product description for failing to point out this lack of subtitles, which would prove significant to many of us.",1338508800,,612,4.865384615384615
8239789,4,B00004RYM7,"I am a huge fan of Doris Drrie's ""Nobody Loves Me"" and have been searching for a copy of it with English subtitles for years now to no avail. I just rented a copy of ""Am I Beautiful?"" from Netflix and have fallen in love with this film of Drrie's as well. Her quirky treatment of love and death, the truthful understanding of the many ages of woman, the assortment of languages and types - all combine to make a moving, funny, personal film which does not shy away from joy or despair. And yet the disc Netflix had in their library must have come from China!! It did have a choice of English or Chinese subtitles, but all of the menus and the label on the disc were all in Chinese. Exactly what do U.S./British film distributors have against Dorrie anyway?",1185753600,6,756,4.330985915492958
