There is no shooting, fighting, harsh speaking, or rudeness. They do show kids how to be kind, and generous, to one another. They teach the kids how to have nice manners, and good imaginations.  These shows, are about a cub bear, and all his best
 friends, that live in the forest; hen, cat, owl, duck, and there is also, Emily she is a little girl that lives with her grandmother, in the forest. These characters goes on many many adventures, and have lots of fun. The cartoons, are bright and colorful, very pleasing to watch. All 8 of our grandkids, have been watching and loving these shows, since they were little. Not even the 12 year old has grown out of them completely, she stills says, ""sure Grandma, I would love to watch little bear with you. (because Grandma watches them even when the little ones are not here.). If there was more than 5 stars, this show would get them all.",1521763200,,1041,4.531914893617022
