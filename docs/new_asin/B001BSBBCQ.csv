3498446,5,B001BSBBCQ,"AFRICA SCREAMS has been in the public domain for years. This dusted-off version looks and sounds the best of a-n-y version I've seen. This is the first version I've seen with the Nassour Studios logo opening the film and it has closed-captioning, as well. I skip the colorized version, as I oppose that sort of thing. However, Legend Films has made this one worth the wait. The scene where the tribal chief is scared white by the giant gorilla is here intact, as well, whereas I've often seen it where his face has been blurred over with darkness. I've found this to be a fine film of the team's, as opposed to, say, MEXICAN HAYRIDE or LITTLE GIANT. If you're still hunting a fine print of AFRICA SCREAMS for your A & C collection ... well, here it is.",1243382400,20,752,4.41726618705036

3498468,5,B001BSBBCQ,I am completing my Abbott & Costello film collection and the quality of this DVD is superb!,1460419200,,91,4.411764705882353
3498469,5,B001BSBBCQ,"I was supposed to get the colorized version but I was sent a mislabled b+w copy so I cannot comment on that version. The copy I am commenting on here is the Vina Distributor b+w dvd. The picture is pretty good. The best copy of this film I have seen was released by Digiview but this is a good alternative. My all time favorite comedy team is the Three Stooges and I have often looked for other things to watch which I felt was pretty close to the stooges and in my opinion it is Abbott and Costello and the closest film in particular is ""Africa Screams."" Besides Abbott and Costello the closest thing to the stooges might be the early b+w ..seasons of The Beverly Hillbillies. There is a very affordable 40 episode, 4 dvd set, of the Beverly Hillbillies avaliable on Amazon titled ""Meet The Clampetts"" avaliable from Mill Creek Entertainment. We all need some films of this sort in our collection to brighten up our days.",1456185600,,922,4.461538461538462

3498476,5,B001BSBBCQ,"This has got to be the best version released to date, The remastering has been very good and of the other 34 Abbott and Costello movies that are remastered by the their parent film studios, ie: Universal, MGM, and Warner Brothers, Africa Screams and Jack in the Beanstalk are the only 2 not produced by a major studio. The sound on this newly released version could stand some more work but I can not hold that against them, they did a top notched job. Originally filmed in black and white there is a colorized version included. I really do not hold for the colorization as sometimes the colors seem a bit off or blurry, this version, however is the best colorization I have seen, that being said it is to date the very best version you will be able to get to date. It has been restored very very well in Black And White, the color version is good too. Well Done.",1414540800,,863,4.333333333333333

3498479,4,B001BSBBCQ,This is a very funny Abbott and Costello movie originally in black and white.  This colorized version is not as clean looking as the black and white version  but it does add something the b&w lacks.,1400371200,,198,4.472222222222222
3498480,5,B001BSBBCQ,I am a huge fan of Abbott and Costello and once again Legend Films made a classic film that much better--colorization was fabulous and this is a hilarious film--you won't be disappointed!,1395360000,,187,4.875

3498482,3,B001BSBBCQ,I like to watch Abbott and Costello with my family because it is good clean fun.  It is not violent as the three stooges.  Poor copy quality for I had to watch it on a cd player.,1387843200,,178,3.7837837837837838
3498483,5,B001BSBBCQ,"In my opinion,Africa Screams is one of Abbot & Costello's best and funniest films. This has always been a favorite of mine. Overall,this is a great family comedy movie...unlike the filth that is made nowadays.",1383004800,,209,5.0
3498484,5,B001BSBBCQ,Grew up watching them and always enjoy a good black and white movie.  They were the best comedy duo before Lucille Ball.  Still watching other Abbot and Costello movies I purchased on Amazon,1375056000,,190,4.7272727272727275
3498485,5,B001BSBBCQ,I just love Abbott and Costello.  This was a funny movie and one I remembered watching years ago.  Abbott and Costello humor never grows old.,1374451200,,141,4.6
3498486,3,B001BSBBCQ,"Standard Abbott and Costello film.  More entertaining than usual but still A & C.Bought it for the color job, and it was good, but not as good as others that have been done.  Still worth the disc if your into the colorizing: which I am if the work is as good as the better coloring jobs on older films i.e. The Mark of Zorro, My Man Godfrey.",1371340800,,341,4.074626865671642
3498487,5,B001BSBBCQ,"I really hate that Amazon allows the reviews for different versions of a film to get mixed together.  The legend version is unique in that you get the original B&W copy of the film and a very nice colorized copy.  They take the B&W version and transfer it digitally and clean it up so they can do the colorization and thus you get a very nice B&W copy (best I have seen of this film).  So if you like the original B&W this is the best copy available now.  If you want to view in color (done very well) you can do so.  The film is a typical A&C film with lots of their humor of Abbott getting Costello involved in a scheme.  Joe Besser does a nice piece of business with Lou and a faucet and his ""my tent's on fire"" bit that worked really well in the A&C TV show.  Shemp Howard has a bit part as ""gunner"" who can't see his hand in front of his face despite his coke bottle glasses(it has been said that most of his scenes were cut by Costello because they were TOO funny).  Hillary Brooke is the evil leading lady (before her stint on the A&C TV show) and Clyde Beatty and Frank Buck are the ""big game hunters"".  Not their best but a GOOD A&C film, you get the bonus of a color copy and a nice price.",1370995200,3,1199,4.004201680672269
3498488,5,B001BSBBCQ,"The Legend Films DVD version is the best out there. Legend Films has provided the original B&W version and new color version on the same DVD. The color of the movie was good, but I'd prefer the B&W version first. The quality of the movie was quite good and better than I expected. Overall the Legend Films version is the best choice and I would recommend it.",1367798400,,358,4.358208955223881
3498489,4,B001BSBBCQ,"This is another classic movie of Abbott & Costello. As I said in one of my reviews of another movie I bought for my dad, they bring back memories for me when my dad and my mom watched all of their TV programs and movies. I like their movies.",1362441600,3,241,3.938775510204082
3498490,5,B001BSBBCQ,"another dvd for my collection,  great for a day when you can't stand to go out, cold winter day,  haven't had the opportunity to watch it yet  but i am sure it will be great",1359763200,3,173,3.8857142857142857
3498491,5,B001BSBBCQ,Long have we suffered through really poor transfers and copies of this Abbott and Costello classic. Since it has fallen into public domain it has suffered form many poor low quality releases. But Legend finally did the movie justice. This by far the best quality version I have ever seen. The Sound is cleaned up and amazing. The Restoration of the B&W version and color version are both amazing. It is bright crisp and clear. I never thought I would ever see the film in such high quality. If you love Abbott and Costello this is a real plus to your collection. Great quality and very low price. I would highly recommend the legend In Color version of this classic.,1357171200,4,666,4.558333333333334
3498492,5,B001BSBBCQ,"This Vendor offered excellent prices and fast delivery, but no shipping discount for multiple purchases.  So I just considered the shipping charges to be part of the price and the shipping to be free.  Even with that, the prices were great.

I was very pleased to finally obtain this movie for my Abbott and Costello collection, along with ""Rio Rita"" and ""Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd"", and all from the same Vendor at excellent prices.  Now all I need is ""Dance With Me Henry"".

This movie is fun and the colorization process used is excellent!  It looks better than their 2 movies that were actually made in color.",1320624000,3,625,4.6880733944954125
3498493,3,B001BSBBCQ,"It was fun to see them in color and the end is gooood...for once the little fellow is a big winner! But I was expecting more comedy...I was almost bored. I was hoping for something as funny as ""Hold that ghost"" but it was not....from far! It's an OK movie if you're a big fan of the duo.",1317600000,,287,3.9655172413793105

8284575,5,B001BSBBCQ,The colorizing was excellent. The B&W version is also included. Yes this is a Public Domain movie but the copies on the internet are poor quality. The DVD was made from a clean print and is well worth the few dollars. This DVD is from Legend Films. I have a few of their DVD's and I can say I'm well pleased with their colorization work.,1484784000,,337,4.2
