8020468,3,B000228SRI,"""The Times of Harvey Milk"" and ""Common Threads"" are excellent documentaries and well worth having in your collection but take my advice and buy them separately and don't waste money on ""Where Are We?"".  The premise of ""Where..."" is the directors traveling through parts of the country that might not be so receptive to an openly gay couple.  Well, from the interviews you can't even tell if the subjects know they are being interviewed by two gay men.  At no time do the directors identify themselves on the audio as being Gay.  I rented ""Where..."" from Netflix and feel that it isn't up to the standards of their other documentaries.  Rent it if you have to but don't waste money on it.",1202515200,3,687,4.598360655737705
8020469,5,B000228SRI,"That Harvey Milk's election to the San Francisco city council made him the first openly gay elected official in the country certainly justifies this documentary look at his life and career.  The fact that this political event coincides with the ascendancy of Anita Bryant, the Moral Majority, and California's controversial Proposition 6 (which sought to make it illegal to employ any gay person as a teacher in the state's public school systems) gives the film a nail-biting second act. But add the fact that Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by fellow council person Dan White, and you have a riveting truth is stranger than fiction psycho-political drama.  The scenes and remembrances of the spontaneous candlelight march from the Castro to City Hall by thousands of citizens are moving and speak of a grief and loss that goes deeper than words.  The film goes on to document the Dan White trial, the ""Twinkie Defense"", and the violent reaction to verdict.  Unfortunately, you can't view the film today without realizing that at the time these interviews were being filmed, AIDS was already invisibly working its way through the community and would soon all but wipe out this generation of gay men in San Francisco.  That's a different story, I know (see Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt ), but it's like watching happy passengers board the Titanic, talking about a future that you know will never happen for many of them.",1131580800,20,1445,4.979253112033195
