6434951,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"Highly recommended, really helped a 1000X better than the PT I was going to. Costed less than one PT visit.
I had pretty major spine surgey and the exercises my PT gave me seemed to just make it worse. I followed this and in two weeks could tell a huge improvement. I enjoy following it and the lengths is good and easy to do. Its well worth it and made my expensive PT looks like a waste. I even gave my spine surgeon info on it saying he should have his patients skip their useless PT department and follow this.",1438214400,43,514,4.15
6434952,4,B00KN7YTGQ,"My Dr. recommended it because of my bad back...exercises reasonably easy and simple to follow...there are 4 phases.  Think my back is somewhat improved.?  , after a few weeks work.",1436745600,13,180,4.966666666666667
6434953,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I am so out of shape that I was pretty desperate to find a way to remedy this.  My lower back hurts most of the time and I am so tired of being in pain.  I needed a DVD to help me get in shape and strengthen my core muscles.  It just seemed that most exercise DVDs were not for beginners.  So, I did a lot of research using the reviews that Amazon customers gave.  After all the research, I found this DVD and ordered it.  I just finished my first workout (Phase 1).  No pain, just warmth in my muscles.  It lasted 20 minutes and I found that I could do all the exercises.  Sure, I know that I need to improve on some of them, but I really feel like I can.  I will do these Phase 1 exercises 3-4 times per week until I get where I should be.  Then, it's off to the next phase.  So, here's the bottom line.  If you are really serious about getting healthy, then this is the DVD for you.  If you want to have a professional medical team lead you on your path to getting healthy, look no further.  I believe that you will be as pleased as I am with this DVD.",1434326400,72,1055,3.887323943661972

6434955,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I have been dealing with a herniated disc for two years which has caused me so much pain at times, it has completely disrupted my life. I had a year of DRX9000 spinal decompression treatments, and chose to do my therapy on my own. I chose this program and have been following it for 8 weeks now. WORTH EVERY PENNY.  My mobility and strength have increased greatly since I started, and my pain decreases more every day. The program makes complete sense and its obvious they know what they are doing. Another review that I saw complained about having to keep getting up and down off the floor, but it is BY DESIGN. Teaching you the proper way to do it is part of the program. I highly recommend.",1522713600,3,693,4.372093023255814
6434956,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I'll admit it was the exercises were a challenge.  Obviously, those muscles hadn't been used for years and thus the back pain.  I stuck with it and they did get easier and guess what?  No more back pain!!!!  Highly recommend!",1521590400,,225,4.55
6434957,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I love this video.  Has a lot of the same exercises I learned in Physical Therapy, with a nice progression.  Goes from medium to challenging.  Best I've had for core exercises.",1519776000,2,176,4.612903225806452
6434958,5,B00KN7YTGQ,Excellent program.  Exactly what I was looking for. . .methodical and focused without the usual chit chat from the trainer.,1518825600,,123,5.15
6434959,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"So far, so good on using these DVDs for strength and recovery. This program really does start light and have you work your way up. And the 20+ min duration feels just right. Too many other DVDs of this nature dive in too quick (and can cause setbacks). Looking forward to progressing through all the workouts!",1518134400,,309,4.535714285714286
6434960,3,B00KN7YTGQ,"This is OK, if it were priced $20 cheaper I would give 4 or 5 stars. It's not worth this amount of money.
I do like that it has input from specialists and Drs -- I realize you can find countless workouts on youtube, but I bought this because I really wanted a plan I could work through. But the quality of DVDs is just OK. First, the packaging, it's just in a cardboard package, not a more robust plastic one. Second, the video quality is just OK - all one central shot, they don't show many zoom in shots or other angles. Also, one annoyance is the demonstrator does her ACTUAL right side when he says right, where I would prefer if they did it in a mirror image. That's the way most workout videos do it. It's much easier to follow. Lastly, the guy does way too much talking and the workouts proceed much too slowly. If you're like me and you don't like wasting time, it might not be for you. But i have only done the first couple workouts, so maybe he talks less about how this is ""the beginning of your journey"" in later workouts!",1517356800,,1034,4.175
6434961,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"My husband has suffered with low back pain for over a year, but has only recently found these DVDs and started trying to do something positive from a strength perspective. The entry levels seem easy enough but you'll know you did something especially the next morning.  The instructor has a good manner; Very encouraging and instructive.  The demonstrator is modestly dressed and is there to show us exactly how to do the exercises.

Even though we're not far along in the program, I would recommend these DVDs to any friend with low back pain.",1515542400,,544,4.76595744680851
6434962,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I got this as a gift from my wife.  I have used it for 2 weeks and really like the format and how the system is presented.  I especially like how these build on each other.  As I am 71, I suspect I will do these daily, and enjoy it.  You don't have to suffer to get better.",1515110400,,273,3.6551724137931036
6434963,5,B00KN7YTGQ,Great at guiding you through the routines so you know exactly what to do and what the goal is.  Just like having a PT with you.  No special equipment needed.  Would recommend.,1515024000,,175,4.40625
6434964,4,B00KN7YTGQ,Great program.  I am glad I did not listen to the nay-sayers who wrote bad reviews.  Three disks with three programs of instruction each with their own levels of exercise.  I follow along on the mat at home and do the exercises I can do and  fast forward through the ones I know I can't. The only reason I am giving four instead of five stars is because the disk does not have a closed captioning option.,1512777600,3,404,4.207792207792208

6434966,2,B00KN7YTGQ,"I was very hopeful about this DVD package, especially after reading the reviews here.  However, I fear I'm going to have to send it back.
A bit about myself so that you can get an idea as to why I'm posting a negative review:  I am a 71 yr old grandma.  After various MRI's and x-rays, the diagnosis is ""neural foraminal stenosis"", with some arthritis present.  (Basically, sciatica.) I've had the condition for 25 years, and I've been treated by various PT's, and chiropractors.  I am a retired bookkeeper.  After sitting for many years at work, I now sit for many hours at home.  We purchased a wheeled walker about a year ago, and I DO try to get outside on days when I am feeling better to walk around the block.  However, my core is weak - I'm very aware of that.  Therefore, I purchased this DVD program to strengthen my core.  I have no trouble bending over - my problem is standing up straight - especially when walking.
OK, enough about me.  About the DVD:  PROS:  It's obvious these folks know what they're talking about, and I don't doubt that this works for some folks.  I believe it when I read some of the comments stating how much it helped, and I'm happy for you.
CONS:  First thing you need to know is this:  on the very first disc, the first group of exercises, you are instructed to have a mat, a chair, and a bath towel available.  You do some warm up exercises, then you get down on the mat, do some floor exercises, then get up and do more standing, some sitting on the chair, then GET BACK DOWN ON THE FLOOR again, then finish with some standing movements.  WHAT IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND UP AGAIN, ONLY TO BE INSTRUCTED TO DO IT A SECOND TIME???  No, no, no.  As one reviewer said, if you are a senior, and you've been exercising up until the time you hurt your back, then yes, this might be for you.
I'm planning to try the floor work while lying on my bed.  I know it's not optimal, but at least I'm doing SOMETHING!  I will update this review if I decide to keep the DVD's because I've changed my mind
UPDATE:  11/27/17.  I'm sending it back.  Alert: if you send it back, they will deduct $6.63 for shipping to return it.",1510790400,13,2172,4.264705882352941
6434967,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"My surgeons office recommended core strengthening to support my weakened low back. I came to amazon to purchase a Pilates program to supplement the yoga and PT I was already doing, but The Rehab Zone has created a program that combines those activities for me. Ive only watched the first exercise on the first dvd with the plan to use one video daily for a week before accelerating to the next workout. My back is so weak I wear a brace, I cant bend or lift, I walk and stand crooked, and I have a handicapped placardand the first video is both doable and helpful for me. Im hoping at the conclusion of this course to have a stronger back and not have to worry about future injury to my back. My favorite part of the first video is the young fellow with the 1920s South Carolina/deep Georgia accentevery time he says torso, I hear tarsus and wonder when we moved to our feet.  Seriously, it makes me smile.",1509753600,,906,4.3609467455621305
6434968,5,B00KN7YTGQ,I was in Physical Therapy (PT) for 5 months after hip replacement.  Did very well but had to stop for financial reasons.  I continue to do my PT exercises and added the exercises in this DVD which really help keep me moving.  It's a good plan.  I haven't rushed it so am just starting disk 2 after 3 months.  There are Core and Flexibility exercises and they are definitely worth it with regard to recovery after PT.,1505088000,4,416,4.35064935064935
6434969,5,B00KN7YTGQ,I can't believe how much this workout has helped my back. I highly recommend them.,1503964800,2,82,4.533333333333333

6434971,5,B00KN7YTGQ,Excellent! I was not sure if this would actually do what it says but I have been using it religiously and it is fantastic! I recommend it if you have any back pain my quality of life has changed drastically. It is not difficult and you can always continue with the same workout until you master it and then move on. Excellent!,1501718400,,326,4.274193548387097

6434974,1,B00KN7YTGQ,"I returned this product unopened after seeing and reading both the front and back on the packaging. They were pictures of under 30 extremely fit models doing floor exercises. The description on Amazon indicated that it was appropriate for all ages, but I doubt the majority of over 60 year olds would be able to safely and comfortably do these exercises unless they had been exercising and keeping themselves fit their whole life. If that were the case they wouldn't need a video about doing just that.",1492560000,5,502,4.781609195402299
6434975,5,B00KN7YTGQ,I would recommend to anyone. I had a fusion a year ago. This program is adding strength and flexability. My back feels great.,1492473600,6,125,4.478260869565218
6434976,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I have lower back pain due to osteoarthritis. I researched solutions and found this set of DVDs.  I am currently on Workout 4 of Phase 1.  I may be here for a while as this one is challenging for me.  That's ok because it's all about your personal best.  This has been very helpful to me.  The stronger my core becomes, there is little or no pain.  It is like night and day.  Thank you Carl and Dr Morton for producing these.",1490832000,2,425,4.109756097560975
6434977,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"Purchased for my husband who had an L4-L5 disc buldge.  He was skeptical at first.  Says the DVD is actually pretty good.  Teaches strategies for sitting, standing, and protecting your back from further injury after a disc bulge.  Great for post Physical Therapy.",1490572800,8,263,5.046511627906977

6434979,5,B00KN7YTGQ,Great program. There are a few exercises I can't do bc of my back and RA but as a whole this program has definitely made me stronger. Much of the workout is on the floor so if that is hard for you this may not be a good option.,1487635200,8,227,3.6530612244897958
6434980,5,B00KN7YTGQ,I have been using the Dvd's for about a month approx 20-30min a day depending on my schedule.  The improvement it made on my back has been life changing.  I am now able to play a full round of golf instead of heading to the club house early.  Highly recommend using this for anyone who is struggling with back and core issues no matter how old you are.,1485388800,,352,4.147058823529412
6434981,5,B00KN7YTGQ,I wanted to improve my posture and eliminate the back pain I felt every day at the end of the day after work.  A friend of mine used Rehab zone for a few weeks and was impressed so I decided to go ahead and try it.  I have now been using for a couple of weeks myself and I am very happy with the initial results.  I am still in the first two disks but already my back feels much better! And my posture has improved significantly.  Hope the rest of the DVS are as good as the first ones.,1485216000,,486,3.83

6434983,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I just had a baby a couple months ago and I wanted to start a workout program to help strengthen my core to get my body fit again.  Unfortunately most of the programs are high intensity and I was looking for a low intensity program that also helps with back pain.  If you are looking for that type of plan then look no further.  Rehabzone is split into 3 phases with intensity increasing each phase.  The routines are only 20 minutes long and they recommend 3 days/week.  My core is feeling stronger, Im getting fit again, and my back feels great.  Highly recommend this DVD series to anyone who is looking to start a low intensity program and need back pain relief.",1483574400,,666,4.418032786885246
6434984,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"My back pain is finally gone.  Thank you Rehabzone for creating such a comprehensive approach to strengthening my core and working on my balance, flexibility and mind/muscle connection.  Carl is the best and I cant wait until he releases more programs.  I would easily pay 4 x the amount I paid for this series.  The value is crazy high for what you get.  Carls words have inspired me and they will inspire you to take care of the one temple God has given us.  Thank you Rehabzone and Carl.",1483315200,,490,4.449438202247191
6434985,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"I usually don't leave reviews but I have been in back pain for over a year.  I have tried back injections, acupuncture, massage, nerve medicine and nothing worked.  I have been doing this program now for only a couple of weeks and my pain is 90% better.  Carl is so thorough when explaining exactly what muscles I need to focus on as I exercise which is helping me get stronger and flexible.  My friend was the one who told me about this DVD and I am happy she did. For $70, this is cheap for relief.",1483228800,,500,4.177083333333333

I have grand babies and its getting harder to play with them, which frustrates me. I knew I needed to start doing something but since I don't like to exercise and don't have the time; nothing I researched fit what I was looking for.  One of my friends told me about this program and how it helped her with her pain and it only took 60 minutes/week.  I was hopeful and excited because I don't have time but I do have 60 minutes/week to devote to a program.  I thought exercise had to be completed 5 days per week for 60 minutes per session to get results.  Little did I know to reap the benefits you only need 3 days per week at 20 minutes per session.  I am no longer stiff, my back is much looser and I am able to get on the floor with my grand babies and have fun with them.  If you don't have time and don't like exercising, believe me you will like this program!",1483228800,2,973,4.005181347150259

6434989,5,B00KN7YTGQ,The RehabZone DVDs have been much better than expected. I have suffered lower back pain for many years. I have tried multiple books and DVDs for back pain relief and none have worked as well as the RehabZone workouts. The best part is my lower back does not hurt after doing the exercises and I feel that my core and back are getting stronger. I would highly recommend the RehabZone DVDs for anyone suffering from lower back pain.,1478476800,15,430,4.5256410256410255

6434991,5,B00KN7YTGQ,This exercise dvd was just what I was looking for. I had suffered a fall while roofing three summers ago. Went through PT and a chiropractor and neither of them gave me the results I was looking for. This routine built up my core strength and gave me the flexibility needed to get back my life. The pace was perfect and it encourages you to keep advancing. I am up to disk 3 routine 1 and the muscle tone and flexibility is great. When I travel I always take along disk one so that I can keep up my flexibility without having to have weights or mats near by. I recently had some questions and the customer service reps at rehabzone were outstanding. Keep up the great work.,1471564800,40,673,4.265625

I am doing this workout bc I need to strengthen the core area after my twins. It is not difficult but, doing one routine (20 min) is a good foundation everyday. I prefer to take the gentle long term approach over being hard on my body. I will continue to keep this up as long as I can.",1448841600,17,427,3.9195402298850577

8660246,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"UPDATE: I've just finished phase 1 (4 workouts out of 12) and am quite pleased with my progress. The step-by-step nature of this program is extremely helpful in working up to the next level slowly. I imagine this would be very similar to what a physical therapist would ask me to do, but with these dvd's it's like having the PT in my living room with me showing me how to do them correctly.

original review:
So far so good. I have spinal stenosis, and am trying to find a good way to get myself back into shape as I get treatment. I just did the first workout yesterday, skipping a couple of exercises that weren't good for my condition. I can't yet say how effective this workout will be in the long run, but I will post an update when I have more info.

He explains the exercises pretty well so that you don't injure yourself doing them. I'm 50 years old, and have been out of shape for a short time because of my condition, so this is going to work out well for me, I think. However, I wouldn't recommend this for, say, my 75-year-old mother who has been out of shape for decades and has back trouble--she wouldn't be able to do some of even the simplest of these exercises.",1530057600,,1179,4.258928571428571
8660247,5,B00KN7YTGQ,"Great rehab program.  I am a 50-yr old mother of 3, I eat healthy and am not overweight - but I don't exercise other than occasional walking. I had a non-existent core.  :) My lower back began hurting more and more...when I'd wake up I could barely bend over.  It became a burden to even unload the dishwasher, get clothes out of the dryer, etc.  I'm 50, not 90, I thought, so here I am doing RehabZone.  Best purchase ever - I would be paying THOUSANDS for physical therapy which I'm sure is what my doctor would've recommended.  I am on phase 2, workout 2.  I feel strong now (a feeling I've never had) and can easily bend over, do household chores, yardwork, weeding, hacking down bushes, etc.  All the things I used to do.  I feel like I just got a new lease on life.  I LOVE that the videos don't just focus on your abs, which is what I thought ""core"" was.  There is arm work, leg work, shoulder work...the videos really do tone your whole body.  I do the workout faithfully 3-5 times a week before moving on to the next one fot the next week.  The videos start slow and weren't overwhelming for me.  They're about 20 minutes...who doesn't have time for that, when you're investing in your health and your body?  You are up and down a lot, so if that's difficult for you, you may have to hit pause.  Also someone with knee problems may have a problem with the up and down.  Give these a try - they were a life changer for me!!",1529798400,2,1431,4.22140221402214
