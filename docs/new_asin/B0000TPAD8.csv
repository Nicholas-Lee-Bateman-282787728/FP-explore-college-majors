8002844,5,B0000TPAD8,"An old Black Musical...I loved it. This movies was made way before I was born. It kept my attention throughout the whole movie. I'm not going into details about the movie, as I'm not a critic but it was set in South Africa. I know my mother would know about this film and I'm guessing she enjoyed it when it first came out.",1465257600,,323,4.142857142857143

8002848,5,B0000TPAD8,"I saw this film more than 40 years ago when I was a teenager in Pittsburgh, PA. My mom had brought me to the film's limited showing at the Carnegie Museum. The story made me weep; the music haunted me, and the power of the film changed my life. I did not know who Kurt Weil was; I did not know that there had originally been a Broadway musical, but I did read Patton's book, Cry the Beloved Country, with the lyrics amd music running through my mind. My sense of personal responsibility for struggling for Civil Rights in the US, something my mother had tried to impress upon me as a child as she brought me to march after march, Friend's meetings, and other rallies throughout the 60s, finally rooted deeply and blossomed because of this film's haunting power.

Today, as I teach World History and have my students exam colonialism in Africa and the effects still resonating today, I think about South Africa, the lives of the native Africans in the mines, and the lives of the miners of conflict minerals like coltan in the Congo today.

I am so grateful that this film is now available through Amazon Prime. I had purchased two VHS copies from libraries that were discontinuing their VHS collections five years ago and two copies of the LP, one of the original Broadway Musical and one of this film. To be able to view this musical on my phone, computer, or tablet is simply phenomenal.  I hope many people view this film, read Cry the Beloved Country, and commit to the struggle for human and civil rights.",1422144000,5,1510,4.5036496350364965

8002850,3,B0000TPAD8,"Kurt Weill is one of my very favorite theater composers and Lost in the Stars is his last and musically greatest score.  The book by Maxwell Anderson does not hamstring Weill the way his book for Knickerbocker Holiday does (so dated politically that it dampens the vitality of Weill's score).  The two authors find an almost perfect way to dramatize Allan Paton's immortal novel of aparteid ""Cry the Beloved County"" which is too sweeping for a literal telling.  The singing chorus imparting important sections of the drama is very effective.  Hence it is not a piece that will lend itself to film with its harsh realism.  The opening sequences, ""There is a Lovely Hill"" by the chorus and ""Thousands of Miles"" by the protagonist Steven Kamalo are riviting as the camera work shows us the devastation of the Lower Hills and the poverty that these characters inhabit.  From there on some strange dramatic choices are made.  Lost in the Stars is not a perfect musical theater piece, but from begining to end it has a unified point of view.  Serious changes are made to the original, the character of Absalom Kumalo is more musically prominant and the role of Irina, his pregnant girl friend is wrongly taken by Melba Moore.  She is a vivid pressence but does not play the character that Weill and Anderson have written.  Which brings us Brock Peters as Stephen Kumalo giving a performance of great dramatic depth, well sung as well.  He doesn't have the vocal chops that Todd Duncan (the world's first Porgy in Porgy and Bess) brought but who ever would?  His performance is far more exciting than Arthur Woodley's in the only complete recording of the work, but in some ways I prefer Woodley's reserves of voice where Brock Peters uses every bit of his vocal resouces.  On top of that he looses his great solilquoy ""Oh Tixo, Tixo Help Me.""  Yes, Absalom might beg God for help, but his father a Preacher definately would and the music cries out for the more mature voice.  I am glad to be able to see this film of one of my favorite pieces but I wish they had stayed truer to the tone of the original.",1377820800,,2098,4.602150537634409
8002851,4,B0000TPAD8,"My only reason for not giving this 5 stars is my familiarity with, and fondness for, the original cast (audio) recording. That is well-nigh unbeatable, but this is a fine video substitute.",1375056000,,188,4.90625
8002852,3,B0000TPAD8,"Based on the famous ""Cry the Beloved Country"", ""Lost in the Stars"" does its best to invoke the passion and outrage of the former, but only does so to an extent.

The songs are so-so, the directing so-so, some things are better off left as straight drama.",1140393600,,254,4.404255319148936
