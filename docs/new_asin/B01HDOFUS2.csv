7786122,5,B01HDOFUS2,"Added to earlier review: I adored the show, and preordered the Blu-Raze.  Something is wrong with the discs.  The episodes don't play as they are listed.  We had to go back and search for scenes we remembered and that clearly had already happened while watching episodes that were later than the menu flow chart suggested.  I want a replacement!  I would suspect demonic interference, if nothing else.
I consider Season 1 a sublime masterpiece, starting with the theology.  (Spoilers follow) The premise is that the eternal War between Heaven and Hell produced defectors who conjugated, and created a new entity called Genesis.  How wonderful is that?  An angel from Hell and another from Heaven are together in pursuit of genesis, who/which has escaped from its domicile.  By the next to last episode, it is clear that the angels who are male are lovers, and one suspects that they are the parents of Genesis.  What could be a more wonderful premise for a violent comedy than that?
I wish that every religious person, especially those ordained in their faith would watch this series as a part of their education or continuing study, and be required to discuss the subtle questions of theology and faith it so brilliantly and honestly represents.  My favorite among those subtle points overlooked in the previous review:
 the Genesis spirit/demon that has taken up residence in Preach is the offspring of an angel and a demon on opposite sides of the Eternal War between Heaven and Hell, which was of course utterly forbidden by whoever needs the war to continue.  The power the heaven=hell union created competes with, and probably terrifies god, which explains the ending SPOILER ALERT: (god is ####).
Just think, priests, preachers, and maybe rabbis and Imams, what it would mean if there were no war between heaven and hell -- you'd all be out of business.  The two custodians sent to retrieve Genesis from Preacher are clearly gay lovers, one from Hell and one from Heaven; could they be the parents of Genesis?  Why would a demon-baby need male and female parents?  Heaven and Hell are not gendered, are they?
Binge watch this, and be prepared to have its loving methane bubble up in your mind for weeks.",1470960000,4,2210,4.8533333333333335
7786123,4,B01HDOFUS2,"SPOILER WARNING.

Many fans waited a very long time to see an adaptation of Garth Ennis and Steve Dillons epic comic, PREACHER, which was published by Vertigo back in the 90s, and finally AMC has given them what they wanted, but as with most hardcore comic fans, there is bound to be more than a little disappointment.

To start with, the comic was a black comedy with graphic violence and sex that dealt head on with matters of faith and belief in a way that would not set well with many Christians-just the kind of material TV doesnt do so well. Furthermore, the comic was cutting edge back in its day, but sometimes nothing gets old faster than what was edgy yesterday.  There were many false starts over the years with aborted movie projects announced before producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg got the go ahead to make it for television. And right away they started making changes so that the finished product is quite a bit different from the source.  The actual comic story gets started just as the first season ends, with the beginning of an epic road trip, but the producers and the show runner, Sam Caitlin believed that for television, they had to set up the story of Jesse in Annville, Texas, first.

What we get is a ten episode arc that sets up the protagonist, Jesse Custer, the good reverend of the title, and his woebegone flock in Annville, Texas, one of those little towns on the far edge of nowhere so dear to fiction writers.  Jesse Custer is a man with a violent past who is attempting to fill his late fathers shoes and lead his congregation, but Jesses faith in God has fallen on hard times, and feels that no one is listening to his prayers.  That is when Jesses body becomes home to an entity known as Genesis, which gives him the power to command people with the literal voice of God.  Things take a turn, as Jesse then sets out to fix the many problems of his flock, while a pair of heavenly emissaries arrives in Annville determined to retrieve Genesis, and take it back to heaven from whence it came. None of these endeavors work out as planned, setting up a finale where Jesse vows to make God himself appear in his church on Sunday morning and answer the questions of his congregation.

The series got off to a great start, which introduced Jesse and his child hood friend and former partner in crime, Tulip OHare and his new best friend, Cassidy, an Irish vampire, who is marooned in Annville after some vampire slayers try to take him out.  Before Jesse, ""Genesis attempted and failed to attach itself to others who claim great faith, causing them to explode in the process (great Tom Cruise gag here). Then over the next nine episodes, the plot kicks in as Jesse learns to use his new power, various members of his congregation encounter it, while others scheme to take it from him.  Along the way, we get some great dialog, ridiculous situations and some nasty violent confrontations that would make Tarantino proud-the standouts being Cassidy and Tulips introductions and the battle royale at the motel between the two emissaries, Jesse and an un-killable Angel; they're as funny as they are gory. Theres plenty of comedy, touches of outright horror and themes right at home in an apocalyptic drama.  There are great off kilter characters, my favorites being Donny and Betsy Schenck, a fun couple in the bedroom and Odin Quincannon, the wealthy owner of Quincannon Power and Meat, whos idea of God, is quite terrifying.

But for all the things PREACHER has going for it, I agree with those who say this show is a better binge watch than episode by episode.  Too often the story line in the middle episodes seemed to just amble along under the hot Texas sun, while some reviewers complained that they found Jesse to be an unsympathetic lead.  For me, the best part of the show were the sequences telling the back story of The Saint of Killers, a character destined to become one of the main antagonists. This fearsome and murderous cowboys wrath is so great that he has no problem murdering children to punish their rotten parents; his appearances have the feel of an unholy collaboration between John Ford and Sam Peckinpah.

The acting is spot on starting with Dominic Cooper, Joseph Gilgun and Ruth Negga as Jesse, Cassidy and Tulip, but everyone became a fan of Ian Coletti as Eugene Root, a surprisingly good natured teen who is badly disfigured after a botched suicide attempt.  W. Earl Brown is Eugenes father, the Sheriff; Anatol Yusaf and Tom Brooke as DeBlanc and Fiore, the hapless heavenly emissaries desperate to get Genesis out of Jesse; Graham McTavish is awesomely intimidating as The Saint of Killers, considered by fans to be one of the greatest of all comic characters. The great Jackie Earle Haleys Odin Quincannon is one more of his great bad guys, a small town tyrant with a broken soul.  The image of him cradling the meat baby is one of the sickest and saddest things Ive ever seen on episodic TV.

As an AMC show, PREACHER is very different from its other hits, THE WALKING DEAD, BREAKIG BAD, and BETTER CALL SAUL; its one with a definite attitude and sensibility. At times it seems to delight in mocking white Southerners and organized religion, both frequent targets of pop culture, yet at other times it seems to have great sympathy for the various plights of Jesses congregation; one of the flaws of the finale was the lack of concern by Jesse, Cassidy, and Tulip for final fate of Annville after their collective faith is shattered. Despite its less than reverent attitude toward the Holy Trinity, the comic book had many fans who considered themselves to be strong Christians; I believe Ennis and Dillons real targets were dogmatism and extremism and smallness among the faithful, not the deity they claim to love and follow.  Hope the series stays on the same track as it heads into a second season.

Favorite moment: when Jesse Custer tells Donny Schenck hes going to make him hear that bunny in a bear trap sound.

Biggest nitpick: Annville, Texas must be the only town in the South with only one church.

Most poignant scene: the dual suicide of the two high school mascots in the finale.

7786168,5,B01HDOFUS2,"PREACHER is a very stylized version of a popular graphic novel. Be warned. This is not family viewing time and many people may not find the graphic nature of PREACHER to be appealing. For those of us, who like something different, PREACHER will take you on a bizarre and fascinating ride.

Here is a series with a great cast. Be prepared for a quirky and stylized look at an other wordly experience. Preacher Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) is returning to a small Texas to head his father's church. Preacher Custer has a past--a really bad past--but now he has seen the light and wants to spread the word of God. Enter childhood friend and former girlfriend Tulip O'Hare (Ruth Negga) who has not seen the light and is set on Custer returning to his true ways.

A mysterious force enters Custer and gives him powers of an immense nature. Will he use these powers for good or will everyone be destroyed. PREACHER is so much fun to watch and every twist and turn have the viewer wondering how the writers create such gloriously wicked fiction. Is this special power a gift from God or a curse? Everyone in town has a secret and even the humblest and meekest of souls is willing to do the devil's work.  Jackie Earle Haley is deliciously evil as the local slaughterhouse tycoon Odin Quincannon obsessed with meat and expanding his empire. Does it get any more bizarre than this? Sure does. Wait and see what happens when some angels get into a bloody earthly fight. This seen is so violent and bloody and yet totally hilarious since you really can't kill an angel..or can you?

Be prepared to expect the unexpected. The surprises come from all directions and they are always bizarre and usually shocking. There's the vampire Cassidy (Joseph Gilgun) with another strange history and an Irish accent that is usually undecipherable. What did he just say?
This is one truly unique and bizarre series with a cast from heaven. Everyone plays his or her part to the max and there are many characters to absorb and savor. It is totally crazy on all levels and that what makes this series extraordinarily delicious.",1494806400,12,2101,4.6702702702702705

I fall into the latter because to me it felt like a washed out shadow of what preacher is. Problem 1 is seth rogen got his claws in this and at his best he is mediocre whether as a creator or an actor. Problem 2 is this is on AMC, while AMC does push things a little they still neutered the show to the point where it feels like an attack dog with no teeth and thus robbing the show of its poignancy. It really should have been on netflix or something where they could have done it justice.

7786185,3,B01HDOFUS2,"First off, this review is for the finished product, not the show itself, which is phenomenal. 10 stars.  It's an amazing take on the comics. Great job guys.
As for the Bluray itself. It needs some work. Hell it needs a recall and a better product sent out in exchange. At first glance it's a slick package and looks great. I would have liked an outer sleeve, but that's not really a problem, just a nit pick. There are a few big flaws and a few small ones.
First of all, the disc menus. They suck. They're frustrating, and annoying. Sure they look nice, but they are ugly deep down. I could have done a better job and I'm half tempted to upgrade to a bluray burner on my PC so I can make my own version. Hell the menues on the home made porn DVD's I used to make had more effort put into them. Now I'm rambling and revealing way too much about myself so I'm just going to go ahead and finish this in list format fro anyone else with ADD.
1 The menu is the same for all 3 discs. That is each disc's menu shows content that is on all 3 discs and selecting something not on the disc just gives a message ""insert disc 2/3""  in plain letters off to the side.
2 Reaching the end of a menu closes it out and resets it back to the main screen, which is kind of abrupt when you are just trying to see what is on it. Plus, you could have changed it up for each discs menu, maybe added some looping graphics, or something.
3 Instead of listing the disc content on the little 2 page flyer included inside, they put that all on the back of the sleeve so you need to remove it to read or remove all the discs, and then realize you still can't read it well and remove the sleeve anyways.
4 The deleted and bonus scenes promised to us on disc one are nowhere to be found. I'll try loading it into a PC later and see if they are burried there somewhere. UPDATE. We found them within each episodes individual scene selections. Is this a new thing they're doing now? So this one gets a pass. I was most upset thinking they were missing.
5 I did like the special featurettes they did have.  I felt they could have had an extra one talking about the comics a bit more in depth, though that would probably give a lot of spoilers as the last scene of the series is basically the first scene of the comic series.  Though having read almost all the comics I was still constantly surprised (pleasantly) in the directions they took.
6 What I really wanted was some commentary tracks. Imagine Seth, Evan and the rest of the cast and producers all sitting around getting high or drunk while recording the commentary.  An opportunity missed.

7786193,5,B01HDOFUS2,Loved the comic and now love the series. I watched it on AMC so I already knew I was going to love these discs before they ever arrived but now I can watch it whenever I like,1477958400,4,174,3.72972972972973
7786194,4,B01HDOFUS2,"I have never read to comics, so this is coming from that point of view. I found that the characters were very well written and the interactions between them handled with care. The show keeps you watching, but some of the episodes do drag and fill like they are just trying to fill a slot. Overall worth a look, and I am anticipating where it is going.",1477094400,,351,4.253731343283582
7786195,5,B01HDOFUS2,"This show is awesome. Imagine a world where vampires,angels & bad men & women occupy a small town in Texas
The show starts with an orb of good/evil energy flying through the universe & lands in a preacher,well 2...the 1st preacher it occupied literally exploded..and it moved on,to find Jessee Custer. He is an oldschool street vet,hitman for hire & not to be messed with kinda guy. This power of good/evil in Jessee moves his hand in what he does,from taking a town where maybe 20-30 followers show up to a rundown church to a town where everyone comes out to see the preacher.this town has a shady police chief,shady Mayor & shady folks,from xxx offenders,addicts,abusers,alcoholics,and the sherrifs son tried to kill himself & his girlfriend. The sherrifs son survives but not the gf that he shot..she remains in a coma. The whole town really hate the sherrifs son,and the sherriff himself despises his son. These angels are on earth to obtain that good/evil thing that is inside the preacher. Their is a vampire who literally drops into this town (from 30,000 feet in an airplane) and becomez friends with preacher Jessee. This power effects everyone differently when it speaks through Jessee to pursuede them to do things. Seth Rogen had a hand in this show & you can definitley get the dark humor in the show. This is an off the wall kinda crazy,in a good way. You watch 1 episode & you just want to watch them all in a row to catch up & watch it cuz the storyline is addictive,off the wall crazy. Funny,crazy,sad,twisted,awesome. It is like a dark horror film & comedy that lasts 8 1/2 hrs. Jessee made a promise to his father,who was also a preacher that he would come back & spread the good word. The whole town has problems & the preacher & this power shift the crazy things up & make it even more insane. Trust me if you like off the wall,odd kinda humor,then get this. I was a fan of the show when i first saw it & now that it is on dvd i had to get it. Don't sit on it. I would & could go into more detail,but my review got pulled before,so i woll leave it at this. Just take a chance & i guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1477008000,,2141,4.409090909090909

7786197,3,B01HDOFUS2,"I don't have cable TV so I saw the ads for Preacher online and thought it looked like a frightening show with plenty of action be tween the forces of good and evil.
Instead I found a show so slow and boring I have not even finished watching it.
Bottom line ... Buyer beware.",1476576000,,274,4.092592592592593
7786198,5,B01HDOFUS2,VERY GOOD,1475971200,,9,4.0
7786199,1,B01HDOFUS2,I love the comic series and this isn't it . In my opinion this is a slap in the face . They claim to have made this because they loved the books but  completely change almost everything . I couldn't make it though the whole season was unwatchable but that's what I expect coming from a Hack like Seth Rogan .,1475798400,3,308,4.049180327868853
7786200,4,B01HDOFUS2,I'm not very well associated with the source material for this show. Regardless I found Preacher to be unlike anything else on television this year. Its humor and premise reside squarely in left field. I would recommend this show to anyone looking for something a little off the wall. Also Joseph Gilgun is fantastic!,1475798400,3,317,4.888888888888889
7786201,5,B01HDOFUS2,"Pilot was o-ver THE TOP!the best show since Dexter,TWD and Spartacus season one! tongue in cheek good vs evil fun for the entire congregation.this is how u create a sleeper hit TV series! Will have u rooting for the good guy,bad guy(s),And the strongest new little known female costar heroine to grace the screen since Alien. Seth Rogen's masterpiece.he helped create/produce. No matter who you are,no matter what or who you believe in,if u watch this and aren't blinded by the light then there is no saving u. Preacher Rocks! Dominic Cooper was Born to play this role! by the way,parental discretion advised.contains bloody violence and some religious material that some will find offensive if taken too seriously as well as potty mouth(no pun intended,there),meaning foul language. 2 paws and 1 tail wayyy up to the heavens!
