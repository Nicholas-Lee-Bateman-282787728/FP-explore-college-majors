7811359,4,6301395662,"This review is for the Video Treasures 1989 VHS re-release of ""Chained Heat"". Some sellers are indicating that this release was the original from 1984.  Vestron Video was the first to release this classic ""Women In Prison"" movie.  Overall, the mono sound and video quality on the Video Treasures release are good for a VHS, it's clear and not grainy or tainted with a lot of video noise.  However, there are some scenes in the movie that are very dim. This film wasn't bright to begin with, but the LP recording mode exemplifies some of the dimly lit scenes more and makes it a challenge to view what is going on in the dark.  In the Vestron Video version, some scenes are dark too, but they better defined since the Vestron version was recorded in SP.  Like the original Vestron release, all the flaws in production are still there; some scenes that are out of frame, showing a black bar at the top of the screen and visible boom mics.  This all adds to the character of this movie.  The only downside is that the Video Treasure version was recorded in LP for the consumer market, not SP, unless it's a former rental.  I am speculating that since Video Treasures re-released movies years after their formal video release to retail, at a discount, the way they saved money was to record movies in LP to use less tape and keep production costs down.  The upside is that at least it's not an ""EP cheapie"", I would have given this version 0 stars then.  It's best to check with your seller before purchasing the Video Treasures release, if you are selective about the speed the movie was replicated in and the overall picture quality.  On a final note about the VIdeo Treasures release, their version is the same 96 minute US/Canadian release that was offered originally on Vestron in 1984. No cuts or additions.
""Chained Heat"" is available on DVD currently, with 2 other movies; ""Red Heat"" and ""Jungle Warriors"".  The full unedited European 98 minute version is released by Panik House and the US/Canada Cable TV 88 minute edit offered on the VSC release.  I've seen both versions.  The picture and sound quality are vastly improved compared to the VHS releases, with the VSC release being the best overall picture & sound quality.  For my personal taste, concerning both DVD releases, it's a case of too much added violence in the unedited version and too many cuts in the edited version.  The original 96 minute version is just right.  I would have liked to have seen the 96 minute version released on DVD, as a stand alone.  Where they used the original movie poster artwork, just like Vestron & Video Treasures did.  If they had to, offer both the 96 minute and the 98 minute version as an added option on the DVD and forget about the 2 other filler movies. With this being said, when it comes to viewing ""Chained Heat"", I'm just going to stick with the trusted VHS version.  For this is what I'm accustomed to viewing over all of these years.",1347062400,,2945,4.573333333333333
7811360,5,6301395662,"I bought this movie at a yard sale many, many years ago, has been one of my favorites ever since. Not that I am into prison type movies, but, I had to get this movie just because Linda Blair was starring in the movie. Although this movie aired a long time ago, when I watched it, Linda Blair looked so good then and I bet she is still looking good! What a Total Babe, she has it all, The 3 B's, Beauty, Body, and Brains. I still watch this movie after all these years, and just don't get tired of it. I mean, who could get tired of Linda Blair! There were many fine actresses in the film, but Linda Blair was the star as far as I am concerned.",1334793600,3,643,3.953846153846154
7811361,2,6301395662,"Why did casting directors keep assuming cherub-faced Linda Blair had what it took to carry a picture--she didn't have it 10 years earlier when filming ""Bored..."" I mean ""BORN Innocent"" and she hasn't improved here either.

You'd think with two sirens like Stella Stevens and Sybil Danning in the cast as well as Cleopatra Jones (Tamara Dobson) herself, ""Chained Heat"" would generate some...well, HEAT...but this turkey can barely manage lukewarm. Maybe it was the script, or perhaps the Peter Pan hairdo, but Stevens' was disappointingly wasted here considering how camptastic she was in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or even her ""Wonder Woman"" appearance. Carol Ita White (Big Rosie Greenbaum from ""Laverne and Shirley"") is more entertaining here than Stevens is in what's basically a bit part. Profilic character actress Nita Talbot also makes the most of her short time onscreen.

It never picks one direction and stays there--the movie can't decide if it wants to be softcore porn (there's some steamy, explicit girl-on-girl shower action), exploitation (a sleazy rape scene where the lesbian guard licks her lips as she watches the female inmate violated by a sweaty horn-dawg) or a female action flick. The script is all over the place and the writers try and spice things up when things lag by having the prisoners release a barrage of expletives that come so fast and furious it starts to sound like a tourette's convention.

A few laughs thanks to some one-liners and the attack of a tranny hooker while the gals are waiting to be booked, otherwise a waste of time. If you want fun but still-sleazy Women In Prison flicks, you're better off skipping this one and watching ""The Big Doll House"", ""The Big Bird Cage"", or best of all ""Reform School Girls"" again. The widescreen print that appears on the DVD Triple Feature looks terrific, however.
