8303764,5,B001G4ANQU,"The following applies to all three (so far) DVD-s in this series. The cooking instructions are given by a first rate chef and a separate narrator. This is a very good idea, since it is almost too much to ask from a chef, to also be a good narrator. This time, there is no mumbling, and missing the description of ingredients. The food preparation is expertly done and filmed with great taste. Finally, here is a chef, who does not wash her hands with the lemon juice put in the food. Ask yourself, would you like any chef to pour lemon juice into your dinner through their fingers? The use of a lemon squeezer is well noted.

The videos are short, and to the point. No wasted time. Accordingly, the price of these DVD-s is very affordable. Learning these great techniques is instantly gratifying. If one can prepare even a single great dinner from these instructions, the DVD is worth its price.",1295568000,2,895,4.5246913580246915
