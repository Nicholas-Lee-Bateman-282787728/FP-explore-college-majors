2657280,4,B000IHYXSU,"Kind of reminded me of Johan of Adam Sandler. The movie used a lot of Hollywood elements, and few American cultural references [for example, the hippie girl character in Humburg.] Of course, this is a funny movie that has been on the borderline of absurd humor, from beginning to end. But funny after all. You won't regret it. Totally nothing serious here.",1373328000,,356,4.758064516129032

I've got two words to get the attention of fans of international cinema who might otherwise overlook this film: Fatih Akin. This singular mark of excellence (writer/director of Head-On [Gegen die Wand] and Edge of Heaven) adds his writing chops to this under-appreciated gem.

Oh, let me give you another two words: Sibel Kekilli. The breakout star/beauty/discovery of Akin's Head-On appears here in a very small role about two-thirds of the way through. [You really need to be on the lookout for her.] 'Kebab Connection' was filmed prior to Head-On's release and Ms. Kekilli's subsequent explosion, so she's a bit part player here. But when she appeared unexpectedly, I yelped with the delight of this little 'Easter Egg' planted in the film.

Viewers of Akin's work will appreciate director Anno Saul's somewhat lighter take (vs. Akin's heaviness) on the complexities of being a Turk raised in Germany. And Saul's superlative ""movies within the movie"" are the real gems here. These are the two 'commercials' that Ibo (Denis Moschitto) makes for his uncle's kebab (""doner"" actually) restaurant. These aren't so much commercials as they are short films of the kung-fu genre (Ibo aims to one day make a full-length feature). His uncle thinks his money has been squandered...until the masses pile in as testament to Ibo's genius and vision.",1243728000,3,1607,5.600823045267489

8145543,4,B000IHYXSU,"Kebab Connection is a movie that explores the struggles that emanate from cultural differences between German and Turkish cultures in the context of per-parental conflict.  The main character, Ubo, is seen as a clumbsy and simple minded individual who happens to be Turkish.  This is shown through him trying to explain a plot line for a kung fu movie, but can't figure out the reason that the characters in his movie are fighting, and both when he kicks the TV on accident, and forgets to block while greeting a friend and gets hit in the head.  This I believe normalizes him into the German society so as to take away from the cultural side of the movie and add to the characters individuality.  Ubo is still Turkish though and still holds some seemingly Turkish values, such as the fact that he didn't want to push a baby carriage, because Turkish men are perceived not to push carriages around, or as the mother of Ubo's girlfriend says ""have you ever seen a Turkish man pushing a baby carriage?""  The struggle between cultures is exemplified in this scenario as well because of the distrust Ubo's girlfriend's mother has for Turkish men that is based on stereotypes.  Ubo's father also plays a roll in this by kicking Ubo out for impregnating a German national.  This stereotype is then strengthened when his father hits the car of another Turkish man, to which the Turkish man, at first angry, is then understanding, almost immediately, when he hears that his son had impregnated an ""Unglubige."" This movie makes several references to famous Hollywood kung fu cinematics, such as the scene where Ubo asks advise from a hologram of Bruce Lee.  I do not believe that this takes away from the main point of the plot of the movie, or the cultural image of German Turkish characters in cinema contrary to popular believe.",1477353600,,1822,4.743670886075949
