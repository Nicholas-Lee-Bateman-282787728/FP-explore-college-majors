7820659,1,6302086647,"If you know anything about electrical circuits, you will find this video to be horrible.  The corny music is bad enough.  But the science is just so terribly wrong on many points.  If I may quote from the video, ""AC current flows in both directions.  DC current only flows in one direction; away from the battery.  So with DC current there is no complete circuit.""

This should be labled ""Science Fiction"" and ""Humor.""  It should not be shown to children in hopes of advancing their education.  I showed it to college physics students.  They stared in stunned disblief.  They rolled on the floor laughing.

Please don't buy this video for your children.",1137974400,7,653,4.741071428571429
