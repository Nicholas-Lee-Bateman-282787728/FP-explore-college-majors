639300,5,6303418872,"We have a two year old that has a facination with trucks. He has a few Monster trucks of the Match Box type. He caught a monster truck show on ESPN. Move over all non-monster trucks. He knows Grave-Digger, Big-Foot and others that I'll never know. So we saw this tape and figured it must be good. (We have other tapes in this series.) I can't stand it. My wife can't stand it. Our two year old loves it. Watches it over and over. And over. Finally I ...ordered two other Monster Truck VHS Tapes and a couple of Monster Truck Books. Not to spoil our child but to preserve the parents sanity. We figure that different monster truck books and videos are better than the same monster truck books and video, over and over again. Oh, and why then the five stars? We just put ourselves in the shoes of our two year old.",1042761600,7,812,4.245161290322581
639301,2,6303418872,"My son LOVES all trucks, machines, trains, etc.  There Goes A Firetruck is great, you actually learn about and see firetrucks.  We thought There Goes A Monster Truck would be similar...WRONG.  The movie has a goofy story line and TOO much Dave and Becky...they even have an arguement!  This is a good video to borrow or rent - but I don't suggest buying it.",1036108800,5,357,4.53125
639302,5,6303418872,"After previewing this video for my kids, I almost sent it back... it is sooooo dorky and slow that I suspected it would not capture the attention of my juvenile monster truck junkies.  But it was fairly educational, had a simple (albeit goofy) plot with some consequences for not following directions (stuff like Dave driving a truck when he wasn't supposed to yet...) And I was happy that a female mudrace driver was featured.  So, I let them decide for themselves.  Well, I should have known... my 2-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter think that Dave and Becky are hysterical and LOVE the footage of the trucks which includes Big Dummy, Bigfoot, Grave Digger, Snake Bite and Dragon Slayer.  It's their new favorite video and they ask to watch it every day!  Now that I've seen the video several times, I can appreciate the appeal to little kids. BONUS: we even followed Dave and Becky's recommendation to learn more about monster trucks at our local library!  Now we're considering getting another Dave video...  : )",1025222400,,1020,4.827586206896552
639303,5,6303418872,"Our house loves all the ""Dave video's"". Our litte monster
truck driver can watch the videos over and over, and us
bigger people get a chuckle also. What is nice about all
these videos by Dave Hood, is, there is no talking ""down""
to the kids.
We have almost the entire collection, and give a big thumbs
up!!",1021593600,,306,4.293103448275862
639304,5,6303418872,"Our 2 year old son loves trucks and Dave Hood videos, and this one is no exception. While we parents may groan and roll our eyes at Dave's corny behavior and some bad acting, our children will be transfixed. The humor and story line really are directed at the children, rather than the grownups, so be prepared. It is a very exciting film with a lot of good monster truck action, including footage from a monster truck arena show. As usual, it is very educational, with lots of good information about how monster trucks work, how big the tires are, etc. The Dave films don't get much better than this one!!",1017878400,,606,4.468468468468468
639305,3,6303418872,Dave Hood has let the clowning around get in the way of the real stars of this video - the trucks themselves. It's tolerable if you skip past the worst of the clowning - the ridiculous side-story that involves Dave and Becky abandoning the Big Dummy truck in the desert. But this video compares poorly with the the two others in the series we have (fire truck and train) where the clowning can help to teach about the subjects.,1005436800,2,427,4.417721518987341
639306,4,6303418872,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this video series.  We have purchased, Monster Truck, Truck, Race Car and Motorcycle.  Every morning and every night, he askes if he can watch his movies.  I think the footage is just right for a toddler, however, the hosts are kind of corney.  They do however entertain the little ones.  It was the best entertainment money I have ever spent.",1002672000,,371,4.477611940298507
639307,1,6303418872,"This is the first ""There Goes A"" video we've purchased.  We found the hosts, Dave and Becky, to be kind of stomach churning and idiotic.  I do not want my 2 1/2 year old son to think that this is a cool way for people to act and interact.  We think it's great that he loves monster trucks but we don't want him to emulate the behavior of Dave and Becky.  We will take this one off our video shelf and find another that shows more actual footage which is the real reason we wanted a monster truck video for our son.",984096000,5,514,4.009803921568627
639308,5,6303418872,"My son age 6 and daughter age 3 love the whole ""There Goes a ...."" series.  They think Dave and Becky are the greatest.  My daughter particularly loves the Monster Truck video.  She thinks the huge  trucks running over cars is very entertaining!  Great series.",952992000,12,260,4.688888888888889

7845683,5,6303418872,"The Grand kids loved the entire series of There goes a truck.  The boys watched the series over and over.
They learned so much about how real trucks work.  They rate an A grade.  I hope they are now made in DVDs.",1293494400,,212,4.0
7845684,3,6303418872,"My boys LOVE this video.  My only complaint is that on several occasions ""Dave"" pushes, smacks or yells at ""Becky"" in frustration.  Even in play, this is inappropriate. This video is aimed at boys. They didn't need to add these little tiffs.  It only detracts from an otherwise great video.",1094428800,8,290,4.76
7845685,5,6303418872,"(per Mommy)  I love this video.  I'm only 2 and borrowed this from my cousin, but I loved it the very first time I watched it.  It is second only to my Dora videos.  I really like it when the trucks go over bumps and jump in the air.",1088640000,,233,3.693877551020408
7845686,5,6303418872,"My son has LOVED this video for 1 year now. After renting it to death at the video store I finally purchased it. I have no idea why it's so fantastic, but every boy under the age of 7 on our block absolutely loves ""There Goes a Monster Truck"". Beware- It's loud, it's muddy- it brings out the testosterone in your boy!",1084492800,,318,4.145161290322581
7845687,4,6303418872,"My son is into any kind of truck and he really likes this video.  Dave and Becky are kind-of annoying and the plot is hokey, but it works for toddlers.  You'll get your money out of this one. :)",1065744000,2,194,3.948717948717949
