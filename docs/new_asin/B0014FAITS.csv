8255654,3,B0014FAITS,"My attention was drawn to this movie through a clip I saw in the film ""Room 237"".  The
title also piqued my interest.  The movie was produced on poverty row in 1925 and
had a delayed release in 1927.  It exhibits minimal production values with a lot of the
effort and funds apparently being directed to Sitting Bull's costume.  If you are a movie
buff and have some experience viewing silent film you may find this flick interesting.
Otherwise I cannot recommend it.",1382745600,,466,4.578313253012048

Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)
