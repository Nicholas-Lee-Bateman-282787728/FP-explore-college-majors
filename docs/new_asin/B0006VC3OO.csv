2196560,4,B0006VC3OO,"...this is a ""high concept"" staging that actually works.  Director Cesare Lievi and his design team have successfully realized Rossini's nonsensical world in a fanciful way that never once gets in the way of the music.  The main attraction here is, of course, Cecilia Bartoli, and she is in prime form, singing with her customary brilliance and precision.  One wishes that some of the voices were stronger (Judith Schmid's Zaida is particularly weak) and that Ruggero Raimondi were a little less mature and a little more dashing.  But all in all, this is a marvelous few hours of fun, great singing and inventive direction.",1114214400,20,623,4.961538461538462
2196561,5,B0006VC3OO,What a hoot! Rossini's sequel to Italiana in Algieri has had a hard journey. It was hounded by the allegations he was recycling material - totally untrue. Turco is anything but a retread. To begin with its libretto by the young Romani is a foretaste of Pirandello. The poet of the drama is a main character trying to write the drama as it unfolds. Second the drama although largely farce takes a dark turn briefly in the second act - these characters actually do change. But enough of the libretto its the music that sings. And this is Rossini at his most frothy. Can anyone write more deliriously happy music? And it flows in abundance throughout Turco. Then the performers are on top of it all from Raimondi and Bartoli to all the others. And Welser-Most keeps the bubbly flowing. Finally Zurich gives it a wonderful production that in no way detracts and in many ways enhances the work. Sometimes I feel Rossini is the most under-rated opera composer we have - if you doubt be let Turco convince you.,1113955200,7,1003,4.5777777777777775
2196562,5,B0006VC3OO,"When 'Turco in Italia' was premi&egrave;'red in 1814 the Milanese audience, who had warmly embraced the recent 'L'Italiana in Algeri,' thought it was a rehash of that opera, and they apparently felt they were being cheated. But in fact this is an entirely new opera, with no borrowings from any of Rossini's earlier outings, and further, it may well be his comic masterpiece. There was confusion, also, for many years about the opera because Rossini revised it repeatedly after its premi&egrave;'re and the whole thing got confused as to what was original and genuine and what wasn't. Indeed, in this performance the cavatina for Geronio's 'Vado in traccia d'una zingara' is actually by an unknown composer other than Rossini. Still, both in plotting and in characterization (not to speak of musically) this is one of Rossini's best efforts. The opera lay unperformed for many decades before Maria Callas resurrected it in 1950 (there is a recording, now a bit hard to find, of that production). As far as I know, though, this is the first DVD of the opera, and it's a keeper. Musical direction is in the fine hands of Franz Welser-M&ouml;st and the sparkling stage and costume design by Tullio Pericoli are delightful. Pericoli, understanding the farcical nature of the opera, has used primary colors and stylized costumes and sets (rather as if they had stepped out of a film cartoon). Stage director Cesare Lievi has given his singers funny things to do--although I must say that both Bartoli and Raimondi do tend to ham it up a bit much. As to the musical aspects of this production, there is nothing to criticize.

Bartoli, as Fiorilla, is her usual marvelous self. She flirts, pouts, schemes, has temper outbursts and melts with love all the while producing some of the most exciting coloratura one is likely to hear, even in these days of spectacular coloratura mezzos. Raimondi, getting a bit long in the tooth these days, is still up to the part of the comic Turk. His coloratura may not be as pristine as Bartoli's but it is a far cry from the smudging so often heard from buffo bassos. Fiorilla's jealous aged husband is done splendidly by the young Trieste baritone Paolo Rumetz as is the Turk's former lover, Zaida, sung by mezzo Judith Schmid.

The plot is convoluted (but entirely understandable for all that) and uses a framing device of having a poet-playwright wanting to use in his next production what he observes of the principals. The poet Prosdocimo, sung by tenor Oliver Widmer, is the glue that holds the plot together. And he participates in the many ensemble pieces in the score. Indeed, aside from arias for Fiorilla, this is primarily an ensemble opera. Both finales are hilarious as well as being rewarding musically. The quintet in Act II is marvelous and towards the end of it, there is an ingenious little canonic passage just following 'Questo vecchio maledetto' that shows Rossini's mastery of both form and characterization. Another high point is the duet between Geronio and Fiorilla in Act I, 'Per piacere alla signora,' which is an argument that ends in a sentimental resolution. There are patter-songs rather like 'Largo al factotum' for both Geronio and Selim the Turk. All in all, musically, this is as fine a feast as Rossini ever cooked up.

A wonderful production from the Zurich Opera, this DVD gets a vigorous thumbs up.

2196563,5,B0006VC3OO,"This Zurich Opera production of Il Turco in Italia is a masterpiece.  Of all of the Rossini DVDs that I have, this one is the best, bar none, a nonpareil combining Rossini's shear musical brilliance via the principals, who were made for this piece, and the orchestra,with the acting and the sets - a classic comic opera in the best tradition of Rossini.  We are talking about a veritable musical treasure, a feast for the ears and eyes. Bartoli is magnificent, showing herself to be at the top of her profession. No less can be said for Rumetz's Don Geronio,as the hen-pecked husband, Schmid's Gypsy Zaida, Macias' brilliantly hilarious Don Narciso, which has you rolling on the floor with laughter everytime he looks at himself in his cane mirror, and Raimondi's Masterful Turk.

I had never seen this opera before this DVD, which for me, is now a benchmark, by which all others will be measure. Some of the most beautiful music Rossini ever composed is in Il Turco.  You're watching and listening, and you're tempted to replay to immediately hear it again. Hard to fathom why this outstanding piece is not peformed more, which is truly man's loss.",1113177600,6,1149,4.758793969849246
2196564,4,B0006VC3OO,"You will enjoy seeing and listening this DVD which most special attractive is, obviously, the superb Cecilia Bartoli who is really wonderful in the leading role as Donna Fiorilla, the capricious wife who falls in love with an exotic Turkish Prince. In spite of the fact that this is not one of my Rossini's favorite Operas, I admire the effort displayed  by the Zurich Opera House to present a beautifully staged production which deserves to be appreciated by all Opera lovers. Ruggero Raimoni makes an outstanding Selim, the Turkish Prince who is deeply attracted by Fiorilla but can not forget his love for Zaida. He is not only a great actor and singer but also makes a lovely chemical combination with Cecilia Bartoli. Paolo Rumetz is also brilliant as Don Geronio,  the nave husband who fights for her wife's love and the same can be said about Judith Schmid who plays Zaida,  former Selim's slave and wife. Reinaldo Macias is alright as Don Narciso, but other light tenors who would have done better.",1112918400,5,1006,4.803468208092486
2196565,5,B0006VC3OO,"My title for this critique should say it all, but in case it doesn't, let me add the following. We begin with the fact that it is a comedic opera by Rossini, so let us judge it on it's own merits and not in comparison to epic opera, better-known operas, or even Rossini's mega-triumphs. With that as a criterion, let us evaluate this 2004 Zurich production on musical and theatrical values, and doing that, one would have to be an upper-crust snob not to like what is heard and seen. The orchestra is in top-form, the singers are superb - ""Rossini tenors, sopranos and basses"" - and with Cecilia Bartoli's mezzo/coloratura highlighting the opera, one wonders why she has not been filmed more often and why anyone can give less than five stars to this DVD. The imaginative staging contributes to this high rating: superb stagecrafting which contributed to the enjoyment of the production and did not distract the attention necessary to follow a convoluted plot which makes use of a classic comedic theme used by great playwrights like Shakespeare and great composers like Mozart - and Rossini: mistaken identity. But instead of only one character's identity being in doubt, the uniqueness here is that all the principals are disguised in the second act. Technically, the recording is flawless, both as regards visual and audio, and the current prices for new and used discs of this opera on Amazon make it an outstanding value!",1283212800,3,1426,4.848360655737705
2196566,4,B0006VC3OO,"This is colourful and funny and Bartoli is on top form as usual.  This is my favourite Rossini opera, principally because in this opera, Rossini's musical writing appears very close to Mozart.  When all is said and done though, Rossini is no Mozart and one can tire of Rossini.  By contrast,  Mozart's operas have something of the eternal about them.",1227312000,,350,4.783333333333333
2196567,5,B0006VC3OO,"Il Turco in Italia is much less well-known than Rossini's L'Italiana in Algieri,  but I like it better. It feels so contemporary, with a plot revolving around marital difficulties. The short three-part arias are an inventive break from the usual opera format, making Il Turco particularly accessible to newcomers to the art form. The entire cast is superb, led by Cecilia Bartoli whose coloratura is crystal clear and sparkling. And she has great comedic timing.

This would be a wonderful opera for young people. The energetic cast are all having a great time onstage. The costumes and sets are a feast for the eyes, so colorful and creative. It has a zany plot, short arias and ensemble pieces, quite a bit of slapstick, and a nice little moral at the end (""Slight is the error if afterwards love is reborn"").

Teenagers, in particular, will appreciate the humor that comes from the ingenious ""play within a play"" plot device where the character of the poet is writing the opera as it's taking place. As a result, we get scenes where the players don't know where to stand and the poet is frantically trying to position them on the stage, and scenes where the poet is frustrated because he can't get the players (and even the conductor) to do what he wants. At one point the players are so unhappy with the way the plot is going that they beat up on the poor poet!

The DVD comes with a booklet that discusses Il Turco in general, this production in particular, and provides a comprehensive plot summary. I have a great time whenever I watch this gem.",1160784000,11,1552,4.632727272727273
2196568,5,B0006VC3OO,A very good presentation with the enchantement of the great soprano Bartoli. A beautiful exprerience.,1141862400,2,101,5.8
2196569,3,B0006VC3OO,"This is one of my favorite opera's so I was really looking forward to viewing this DVD.  I would say that I enjoyed about half the content of this production.

The orchestration was the most outstanding element of this DVD.  The instrumentalists where able to bring out subtle nuances in the score that I had never noticed on my recordings.  They where also clear and dramatically effective.  The only downside was that the tempo, at times, was too fast for the performers to keep up with.  I'm a bit torn by that comment because I'm a huge fan of up-tempo Neapolitan opera but only if the language is coherently sung.

One final note on the score, some cuts are made for time.  They lessen some of the melodic continuances which is disappointing to me because what thrills me the most about Rossini's music is his enchanting melodies.

The performers where satisfactory with Bartoli and Ramondi as the highlights.  Bartoli provided her usual fluidic delivery with charming coloring and excellent understanding of the language and how to exploit it for drama or comedy.  I must say that this is the best acting I've seen from her compared to the four other opera DVD's I've seen wither her as a performer.  Her comedic timing is priceless and her manner is spontaneous and fresh at all times.  Her voice is small and becoming increasingly thinner so she doesn't carry over the orchestra during more intense moments (like the stretta's).

Ramondi is, quite frankly, an old man but he's still got it!  In contrast to Bartoli, I think he has one of the most powerful instruments (bass-baritone) out there.  In his older recordings his voice can cary over the most shrill soprano during the loudest ensembles, it blows me away.  His performance on this DVD is one of an opera veteran with battle scars that hinder his performance but still leave him as a force to be reckoned with.  His acting is effortless and his comedy fine, but his voice shows signs of age and strain but these are minor inconveniences compared to the greater whole.

Oliver Widmer is acceptable as the nosey, scheming poet but there's just something about him that I've always found lacking.  It seems like a combination of acting, singing, diction, and stage presence.  He's there but that's about it.

Paolo Rumetz performance as the emasculated husband was interesting.  Ironically enough they decided to show his characters' push-over personality by giving him effeminate qualities.  The irony lies in Fiorilla's contrasting personality as a wily, pushy, female wrecking ball.

The stage direction was awkward at times.  You know when you're watching an opera and it seems that some of the performers don't seem to know what they should be doing or where they should be moving?  This performance had that kind of a feel but at least the sense of comedy is very present and tangible.

The sets and costumes are trendy and whimsical which suits this opera just fine.  The majority of the props and set elements are receded into the back area of the stage with a larger, slanted, pointed dais out front where the majority of the action takes place.  One does get the feeling that in about eight years, both sets and costumes will be seen then as horrendous eyesores.

Lastly, just a note on the originality of this score.  A previous reviewer mentioned that the music for this opera is wholly original but there is one exception that I'm aware of.  The introduzione is based on a musical phrase already used in at least three other operas that Rossini composed: ""La cambiale di matrimonio"" as a Cavatina; ""La scala di seta"" as an aria; ""L'equivoco stravagante"" as a Cavatina.",1138838400,17,3645,4.799357945425361
2196570,4,B0006VC3OO,"Although this opera is nearly as beautiful as Rossini's masterpiece La Barbiere de Sevilla, it is quite nearly forgotten and rarely performed. We are lucky that Zurich Opera made efforts to perform this opera which without doubt becomes a magnificent performance, as especially performed by top singers the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli with her clear rich voice and baritone Ruggero Raimondi. Indeed, it was rather boring at first in the introductory scene, as some unknown Poets were discussing distress due to lack of story material for a certain play. However, it began to be more interesting as Zaida disguising as the gypsy sang by Judith Schmid  come forward accompanied by a harmonious choir. And it became enthralling when the fickle lady Donna Fiorella sang by the divine Cecilia Bartoli and Selim sang by Ruggro Raimondi appeared. The rest of the opera was a surpirse that it was nearly forgotten for so long, this opera is as beautiful as La Barbiere de Sevilla and La Cenerentola. In addition it was also performed magnificently by the singers apart from the two top singers also by Paolo Rumetz as the dumb husband and Reinaldo Macias as the jealous and abandoned lover, Don Narciso.

We really enjoy this opera and appreciate that Zurich Operahaus made such efforts to perform this nearly forgotten title from Rossini's repertoire, as Rossini is my favorite composer. I would say, if you are a Rossini lover then it is recommended to try watching and enjoying this opera",1126483200,7,1485,5.008097165991903
2196571,5,B0006VC3OO,"Rossini's froth and flirtations have an apparently endless appeal for many opera lovers. Certainly Rossini's way with explicating convoluted operatic plots that would defy the average soap opera is pure magic - and his ensemble pieces for singers are models of how it's done.

Not only that, but Rossini arias and duets are often vocal showcases for dazzling techniques that bedazzle with fiery fioriture, energetic whisking up and down the scale, and cascading ripples of coloratura that challenge the greatest Rossini singers to give of their best.

In this enchanting DVD of ""Il Turco in Italia"", there is so much to admire that it seems mean-spirited to cavil at anything. I'd better get the few drawbacks over with as quickly as possible. It really is a matter of the casting - there's no denying that Cecilia Bartoli is by far the best singer here. Without her, this DVD performance would have been rather fun to watch, but certainly no more than competent as an operatic performance. Even the presence of Raimondi does not lift the standard noticeably - he is, admittedly, a bass-baritone of enormous achievement, but most of those lie behind him now. He is still an unbelievably superb Scarpia in ""Tosca"", but the comic Turk of this opera, while not beyond him, is not his ideal role - at this stage for him, anyway. It's good but not superb. One doesn't really understand why Isabella is so taken with the Turk.

The other performers do reasonably well. They are not outstanding, but they do their best and they are mostly enjoyable.

The costumes are gorgeous! There is a real fairytale/folk-tale fantasy quality to the set and costumes, which complement each other in an almost Sendak-like ingenuity without QUITE reaching for such delicious grotesqueries. It's both child-like and somehow ironic... a send-up of monstrously kitschy sitcom furniture and child's fairytale illustrations. It's all blue polka-dots and cute flounces. The ludicrously unreal quality of the Turk's ""Turkishness"" and the entire flirtation-out-of-a-harem scenario is most deliciously captured.

That, and Bartoli's divinely splendid portrayal of the coquettish Isabella, make this a must-have DVD. No one can turn on the pouts and laments that Bartoli can - equally, Cecilia Bartoli is without doubt a world-class singer whose beautiful mezzo voice and personal charm, not to mention her bravura ease with fiendish coloratura, make her the best Isabella I've ever heard.

One may find oneself a little disappointed in the other singers, but bear up - for the fine conducting and the memorable sets and costumes, it is worth watching this DVD. With the casting of Bartoli in the major role of Isabella, who really defines the entire opera, it's not just a matter of watching - it's a matter of must-own-the-DVD, for repeated viewing and ever-increasing appreciation of one of the world's greatest mezzos in a dazzling role to which she does more than justice. Her voice is all velvet and fire, and her lively stage persona is exactly right for this role.",1123286400,15,3040,5.07
2196572,1,B0006VC3OO,"You gave this opera four stars.  I had no problem with the orchestra and they seemed to be having a good time.  But except for Bartoli, the singers are terrible.  This is NOT a four star recording and I've wasted my money and time.

I think I better go somewhere else for recommendations on opera recordings.  Your recommendations can't be trusted.

2196573,5,B0006VC3OO,"I am not one of those rapid Bartoli fans; for years now I've been, at best, rather tepid in my admiration of La Bartoli.  That is until this performance of Rossini's""Il Turco in Italia"".  I don't know when I've had more fun watching an operatic performance.  Bartoli gives a splendid reading of that kind of ""naughty"" Rossini heroine that he is known for with the character of Fiorilla being one of his ""naughtiest"".  (In fact, I can remember reading a review of the Callas recording of the opera  in 1954 or 1955 that said: ""the character of Fiorilla is best described as something that begins with a B"".  I don't' of course,  view Fiorilla that way; however, since the review was from the 50's I'm not surprised that they felt that way because, alas, they didn't view Callas too much better at that time!!) .  Bartoli is a great comedian plus a splendid vocalist-firing off inhuman vocal fireworks (trills,  runs, rapid coloratura fireworks and splendid high notes, as well as low).  She is at one moment full of fire and the next in a heap on the floor feigning great sorrow and remorse while pouring out streams of molten, gorgeous sound.  Brava!
The rest of the cast is splendid with Raimondi, making a wonderful Turk; his years of experience as one of the world's leading opera singers shines ever so bright! He effortlessly exhibits great experience showing the ""young ones"" how it's done.
The ""cartoon like"" production is captured beautifully on the DVD along with marvelous sound.
If you want to have some fun viewing an opera and want to see one of today's brightest stars at the very height of her powers, buy this disc.",1118016000,11,1631,4.6678321678321675
2196574,3,B0006VC3OO,"I sat down to watch this DVD with high expectations; after all it was a comical Rossini opera performed by the Zurich Opera and starring Cecilia Bartoli and Ruggiero Raimondi. From the moment the orchestra started the overture, I realized that the DTS-5.1 sound option highlighted the rather unfortunate percussion section more than any other. The overture to the opera, not one of Rossini's best or most well known, was disappointing and when the curtain rose and revealed the stylized and extremely minimal stage set, I was beginning to wonder if my money had been well spent. Fortunately, the costumes were unusually bright and colorful if somewhat ridiculous and difficult to wear. It was uncomfortable to watch the sultan having to continually adjust his ridiculously pompous `turban.' Other Rossini operas, such as `The Italian in Algiers', have been noted to have problems with lively choreography and the performers' movements on stage being very noisy, and this is no exception. The constant thump, thump, thump as the characters climb on and then jumped off the inclined wood stage was extremely annoying. It was some time before Cecilia Bartoli appeared on stage and, while nobody would ever criticize her wonderful voice, her overacting and contorted facial expressions through much of the opera, left much to be desired and became tiring to watch. It may have been necessary to convey emotions in this way to the audience present, but the close-ups, which are so wonderful a feature of the DVD medium, accentuated this aspect too much. It did not help that Thomas Grimm is no Brian Large when it comes to directing an opera for video. Although there was fine singing, music and eye-catching costumes, the poor stage-set design/props, unadventurous choreography of movements on stage and a `noisy' recording gave it the appearance of something that a typical high school could present, if it was fortunate to have one of the world's greatest mezzo-sopranos on board. Summing up, a mixed bag and rather amateurish.",1116806400,13,2025,5.120845921450151

8043605,5,B0006VC3OO,"While Il Barbiere might be the most famous opera and La Cenerentola is the most fun to listen too, Il Turco has everything you can expect from Rossini. This composer certainly had a knack for comedy as this is another one of his operas buffas. It has a funny story. The performance while not exactly modern but highly stylised. Here it is done in good taste though and while decorations are minimalistic, everything is carefully planned. Costumes range from traditional to highly stylised. The only disappointment is the makeup: Raimondi's character does not look a bit like a Turk, not even from the distance.

What about signing? Fortunately, we are in luck. This production can boast two Italians in the major roles. Cecilia Bartoli is a famous Rossinian and here she shines. She can also act which makes it all the more fun. Ruggero Raimondi seems to be equally at home with Verdi, Mozart and Rossini. I think he is more of a Verdian but here he sings with Rossini style and he can act not only dramatic roles but comical ones as well, as we can witness here. He is a very talented person.

All the other singers while not as famous as their two illustrious colleagues sing and act very well. The orchestra is very good.

Due to its play within a play structure and lots of recitatives it almost feels like you are watching a play rather than an opera. Some masterful touches add to this feel, for example we have a prompter as one of the characters (don't worry, he does not say a word during the whole action). And of course the poet who is not only a character in the play but also a narrator that is inspired by and conducts the whole action.

A very enjoyable productions. It seems like this opera is more fun to watch rather than to listen to. So if you want Rossini beyond Il Barbiere get La Cenerentola and this Turco.",1297641600,,1830,4.486486486486487
