8059781,4,B0009ETD1Y,"I own a few movies like this but i've always wanted the case of the scorpions tail on dvd since i cant find the vhs i first heard about this movies 14 years ago when i saw it in a fangoria magazine and always thought it looked fascination by the cover art and the tital since back then i had a bird who i named scorpion. I just bought this recently at a high price and didn't realize the movie itself came out in 1971, i usually like movies that are based in the 70's n 80's but the price i paid for it on another site wasn't worth the movie. It did keep me enjoyed and i watched the whole movie i was just a lil disappointed with this movie",1495756800,,641,3.900763358778626
8059782,5,B0009ETD1Y,"As far as I know, this is the only DVD print of this film.
Decent transfer, a couple bonus features. If you like the film, it's worth owning",1457568000,,140,4.035714285714286
8059783,3,B0009ETD1Y,"I had waited awhile to get my hands on this understated Giallo. Though I am not as much of a fan of Anita Strindberg, as compared to Edwige, Rosalba, Carla, or B. Bouchet, I was impressed how she projected her look and acting finesse, as she and George Hilton, went thru the typical Gialli plot of money, extravagance, sex, murder, and mystery. The style of Director Sergio Martino was in effect, with wonderful camera work, exotic locales and interesting architecture for the backdrops. Yet, it was little to tame, for my liking, when it came to the actual deaths, fantasy or flashback scenes, plethora of fine looking babes, and having eclectic characters. If you are familiar with, ""Torso,"" ""What Are Those Strange Drops of Blood on Jennifer's Body,"" or ""Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion,"" then this movie might leave you a little underwhelmed, though not in a bad way. If you a are a fan of these movies, then you should see it just because. Oh, lest I forget: the music was decent, yet not as noteworthy as Bruno Nicolai's other work.",1415059200,,1049,4.706521739130435
8059784,5,B0009ETD1Y,"Five stars for the film itself which is an excellent and absorbing Giallo, and a wonderful example of the many engaging attributes of the genre put to fine use.

As for the DVD itself - There a few problems with the English subtitling being either absent or inconsistent during a couple of scenes, but these are relatively minor and do not derail the film in any sense. That aside, NoShame ought be called NoRegrets, because they've put forth a solid and respectful effort in presenting a classic Giallo with all due accord. Kudos!",1262304000,3,531,4.709677419354839
8059785,4,B0009ETD1Y,"""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail"" is an excellent example of the Italian giallo.  It has beautiful women in peril, a killer dressed all in black, gruesome, bloody deaths, and a killer soundtrack provided by Bruno Nicolai (who composed the scores for the excellent gialli from Emilio P. Miraglia:  ""The Night Evelyn Came out of the Grave"" and ""The Red Queen Kills 7 Times"").

  A gorgeous reporter (Anita Strindberg of Lucio Fulci's ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin"") and an insurance agent (George Hilton of Sergio Martino's ""The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh)) investigate the slashing death of Lisa Baumer and the million dollars of insurance money that was stolen from her.  Of course, as they get closer to the killer's identity, the bodies pile up.  Both Strindberg and Hiton are perennial gialli actors.  In this movie, they prove that not only do they look great but their acting abilities are also superb.  Both give believable,, dynamic performances in this suspenseful, well-plotted thriller.

  NoShame has released an excellent DVD of ""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail.""  The audio and video are excellent.  Interesting liner notes have been provided.  There are interviews of the director, Sergio Martino (""Torso"" and ""Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key""), the producer, Luciano Martino, and George Hilton.  I listened to the film in Italian; my only complaint, as far as the DVD itself, is that the English subtitles are missing from the scene where Lisa Baumer was speaking in the telephone booth.  I was forced to switch to English audio in order to understand what she had said.

  I would have given ""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail"" five stars if the killer's identity hadn't been revealed when he was standing next to a wall before entering an apartment to kill the woman who was having an affair with Lisa Baumer's husband.  However, I strongly recommend this DVD for collectors of Italian gialli.  I look forward to seeing more gialli with George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.",1208476800,2,2004,4.901785714285714
8059786,4,B0009ETD1Y,"I think that this is one of the best films in the Italian Giallo genre. It's has a plot twist that keeps you guessing and at the edge of your seat. This is a great intro to ""Giallo"". If you're a fan, get this one quickly!!!",1194220800,2,223,3.869565217391304
8059787,3,B0009ETD1Y,"The most memorable thing about giallo The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is the trailer, which shamelessly compares itself to other `masterpieces on violence' such as The Golem, Battleship Potemkin and M. The film itself is fairly conventional. Director Sergio Martino admits that he padded out the first half after the film's running time came up short, and it shows: it's not until the halfway point that the film gets much in the way of energy. The Scope location photography in London and Greece is attractive and there's some amusement to be had from the terrible model work in a plane explosion or a sunglass wearing villain called Omar who looks like a hung over Charlton Heston in Touch of Evil after being dragged through a thorn bush, but overall the film is nothing to write home about.

No complaints about the DVD presentation, which offers both Italian and dubbed English language soundtrack options, a retrospective featurette, brief stills and poster gallery and that wildly over the top trailer.",1182211200,,1009,4.970414201183432
8059788,4,B0009ETD1Y,"The opening ten minutes are a little rough, with an overdose of crash zooms, distorting lenses, clunky dialogue and poor model work. After the first story twist, however, the film becomes a superior giallo, worthy of comparison with Bava and Argento. Director Sergio Martino stages some strong set-pieces, displaying a visual flair only hinted at in THE STRANGE VICE OF MRS WARDH. It's possible Dario Argento saw SCORPION'S TAIL before making DEEP RED, as some scenes are remarkably similar (check out the murder in the theatre). There's even a bold female reporter, who helps unmask the killer at great personal risk. While DEEP RED is the better film, Argento owes Martino a debt or two. George Hilton is a solid lead - is it his own voice on the Italian soundtrack? - and spaghetti western regular Luigi Pistilli adds a touch of class in a rare good guy role. The plot twists are satisfying, though the photo blow-up trick was well parodied by Mel Brooks in HIGH RISK.",1122163200,10,971,4.785714285714286
8059789,4,B0009ETD1Y,"Case of the Scorpion's tale has all the elements of a good giallo:  grisly murders, inventive, eye-popping cinematography, expressive lighting, swanky interiors, a serpentine plot, and a couple of lovely actresses. While the plot does become a little convoluted, and there is too much dialogue (a lot of which is rather clunky) all of the film's minor faults can be forgiven because the movie is a spectacular visual feast that is just a lot of fun to watch. Many of the names famous to this genre are involved in this entertaining effort, the most prominent of which are, Sergio Martino, Ernesto Gastaldi, George Hilton and Bruno Nicolai.
  This upcomming release, from a new company on the genre DVD scene NoShame, ranks right up there with releases from some of the more well established genre DVD companies like Blue Underground and Mondo Macabro. The image quality of the film print used for the DVD is absolutely outstanding, and there are two audio tracks, one in English and the second in Italian with optional English subtitles. Lastly, the few extras on the disc include interviews with Martino, Gastaldi and Hilton, the theatrical trailer and a poster and still gallery. If you're taking the time to read this review then this DVD probably belongs in your DVD library.",1117324800,19,1279,4.93953488372093
