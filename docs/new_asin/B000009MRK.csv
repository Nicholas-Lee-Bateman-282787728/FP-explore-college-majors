7905527,2,B000009MRK,"Having more refined production values than will be expected from a Hong Kong film of its period, this piece, its title a by-product of the Peter Sellers Inspector Clouzot series, supplies an emporium for the rather slight comedic talent of its producer and featured player Lawrence Cheng, in addition to dreary romantic and action elements that are merely ancillary to Cheng's mugging.  He casts himself as Ma, a vainglorious and largely free of ability Hong Kong policeman who is quaintly mistaken by corrupt real estate developer Teng (Damian Lau) to be the head of the City's Urban Planning Bureau and, as a subsequence, assigned in an undercover capacity to implicate Teng for illicit dealings with Hong Kong officialdom, while at the same time attempting to court Julia (Rosamond Kwan), erstwhile lover of slain Yau, played by Tony Leung Ka-Fai, due to her possession of Yau's pay-off funds given to him by Teng.  While Ma pretends to be a high City official, following Julia as she leads him into a shoal of incongruous adventures, he has plainly become immune to affection accorded him by his fianc&eacute;e/first cousin, acted in a sprightly manner by Nini Li, who frequently endeavours to extract him from tight spots, including a climactic action sequence choreographed by Deon Lam and Tony Leung Siu Hung.  The film benefits from capable direction from recurrent Cheng collaborator Gordon Chan, along with smoothly composed camerawork, all being shot in neatly accomplished sync-sound, and there are solid turns contributed by Lau, and Waise Lee as a police inspector, but a loosely focussed screenplay tenders scant character or plot development, resulting in little intrinsic interest for a viewer in Ma's predicaments (not aided by his sporadic voiceover narration), and police tactics are embarassingly inappropriate.  A DVD package is in letter box format, its dialogue Cantonese with above standard Mandarin and English language subtitles being available; despite the somewhat lower case acting of Cheng, and a fundamentally formless, poorly constructed script, the film did quite well at the box office during a brief run, and would have been better known but for these stated weaknesses.",1168128000,,2206,5.2763532763532766
