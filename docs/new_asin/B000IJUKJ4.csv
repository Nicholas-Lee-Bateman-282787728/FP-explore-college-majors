8146026,5,B000IJUKJ4,"I loved the Popples when I was growing up in the '80's.  The series was fun, adorable, and taught good lessons.  I was lucky to purchase the complete series on dvd because I loved them so much.  This is something very good for kids and grown-ups because you will get a good giggle and smile.  I still love watching the Popples and the other '80's treasures because they had meaning and they were something to look foward to
