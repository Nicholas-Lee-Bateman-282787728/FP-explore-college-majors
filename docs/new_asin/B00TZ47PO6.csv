I'm not ready to give a final opinion on the opera itself, although there's no build up in scenes and the music doesn't change with change of emotion or situation -- and the pacing is consistently lugubrious.  Still, some parts are effective.  Parts of the script reduce the story to cartoonish simplicity, while others drag things on.  The singing is okay, Edgar better than okay.  The staging is also partly effective, mostly not.  But much of the acting is the worst imaginable.  Literally, you could not go lower.  Future generations will use this as an example of how terrible opera production became, and will show excerpts to elicit hysterical laughter.",1484092800,,695,4.982608695652174

8703382,4,B00TZ47PO6,"As other reviewers have correctly pointed out, Reimann's ""Lear"" is one of the better treatments of Shakespeare as opera in the twentieth century. It is, indeed, already one of Shakespeare's darkest and most pessimistic tales. The monarch self-possessed with his own power and charisma makes several bad moves in dividing his kingdom, promoting cronies and lesser relatives to positions of power which breeds the betrayal, deceit and eventual insanity that pervade much of Shakespeare's tragedies. The story is not as well known as the archetypal ""Hamlet"" or ""Macbeth"" and, in part, because those are part of the education mainstream while ""King Lear"" for all its shocking moments and ultimately sad and unavoidable ending is still a bit esoteric even among Shakespeare followers. To Aribert Reimann's music and this production; this is a tough piece to follow for Reimann does not take the Shakespeare play and play it literally end to end and probably for the better. The beginning scene - in fact - where several key players conjoin on stage to air their concerns over Lear's rule as of late sets the tone. It also needs to be said the Reimann's style as a composer is very much a product of the tone of this work but also the time and place in which the composer was finding his voice. This is largely a dense, atonal, thick score with some wonderfully unpredictable and moody touches throughout, such as the very creepy bass flute solo that opens the second act. There are moments which are shocking for their chaos and unsettling for their sadness tinged with paranoia. The performances here are splendid but especially that of Bo Skovhus in the title role. I did have just a couple of comparative issues with this production however and the resultant recording. I have the original DGG vinyl set from 1979 with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and it is amazing! You can still get this on CD and I wish there were a video version of that premiere performance available as well. The staging in this current production, directed by Karoline Gruber is spare, minimalist and - in places - needlessly symbolic (such as the walls made of giant cutouts of key words and expressions. While I did not see the original production with Fischer-Dieskau the booklet that comes with three LP DGG set is finely produced on high quality (ie.. expensive) stock and gives several photos of that production by Auguste Everding and, for my tastes, there is a sort of 'fantastic realism' to the sets and costumes in that original that I missed here. Also, if you have access to that LP box set (I still have mine!) that booklet is way more informative and practically a 'coffee table' book than the little insert that comes with DVDs these days. Lastly, I am no expert on recording live opera but I found the sound and projection on this DVD to be just a bit disappointing.  I never change the output levels on my system but I found this one to be softer and more ""distant"" than other opera DVDs I own and certainly more so than that old DGG vinyl set (just the opening few bars and bass rumble in that one makes you pay attention!)  So, here is my summary: Reimann's ""Lear"" is, to me, one of the most important operas to come out of late twentieth century Germany and from a composer who deserves to be known better (and who actually has never 'cranked out' large volumes of work, either). Therefore, this video release is well worth having even if admit to preferring the look, the sound and the performances of the 1979 original.",1433808000,9,3509,4.73202614379085
