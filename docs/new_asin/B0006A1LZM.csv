8172474,2,B0006A1LZM,"Paulo Mattioli is not a good drum teacher. He plays all of his rhythms slowly and without heart. The video is okay for learning basic accompaniment djembe parts, but there is not much time spent with the duns, which dictate the music. Moreover Mr. Mattioli has not developed his sounds, therefore it is hard to get a feel for the way rhythms should be played. For instance, during the rhythm lesson for mandjani one of the most common, and simple, accompaniment parts is at a march, pa topa - pa topa, but he cannot make these sounds. Instead he comes out, pa toto, pa topa, pa to(idk what this sound is). His left hand is disastrously weak. He needs to take time working on his technique rather than making instructional dvds. Anyway that is my biggest issue with the DVD. Many of the rhythms he teaches can be learned for free on youtube, and the technique, if you get the right videos of course, is much better. If not, well cant be much worse than this DVD.

It was a sorry performance.",1302652800,,990,4.43956043956044
8172475,5,B0006A1LZM,"This series of djembe instructions are easy to learn.  I have first lessons and volume 1 & 2. Compared to other videos for learning the djembe (I have bought 3 other DVDs by other instructors), this one is better than the others for beginners. This one shows the action from above so that you can learn to drum without watching your hands.  Some of these videos look outdated by studio appearance, hair styles, and fashion choices. But make no mistake, Paulo knows the djembe and knows how to teach.",1242691200,,499,4.595505617977528
