4233389,4,B003Z8ZCDY,Horrible the way young women are deceived in coming to this country for legitimate work only to be kidnapped into prostitution.  The scum of the earth are the men who use these girls for their perverted pleasures.  Interesting how criminals suffer indignation when another criminal steals their ill-gotten gains.  This is a must see with a just ending.,1425168000,2,352,5.0344827586206895

4233391,5,B003Z8ZCDY,"Really enjoyed this movie. Goes to show you don't need a big budget to make a well acted, very entertaining movie. The above reviews are better than I could write, I just wanted to give this movie it's due.",1424304000,2,206,4.3076923076923075
4233392,5,B003Z8ZCDY,I love Jessica Pimentel! I think this role mirrors her personality! Very bad a$$!!!!,1414540800,,84,5.071428571428571
4233393,5,B003Z8ZCDY,"I'll be honest, at first I wasn't really sure what to expect from this film.
But I found myself sucked in, almost instantly. It's raw, gritty and at times, it can be hard to watch. I found myself cringing and looking away from the screen during some of the bits that took place within the brothel. But it's unflinching portrayal of the ugliness and terror that exists for many women who are illegally trafficked in to the US is to be applauded. IMO, not many films can really show this without being too gratuitous or bordering on torture porn, but this one did it well, really well.
I really loved how all the stories were neatly tied together, yet not in an overly obvious way. All of the three ""stories"" were brilliant in their own distinctive way, and I too especially loved the scenes displaying Tomo's torment for all the world to see. Not only is Mr. Suenaga easy on the eyes, but he's got talent, the man can go from badass to anguish in the blink of an eye and do it convincingly, that is impressive.
Overall, I'd say this is an excellent little indie gem, and I'd love to see more from those who are responsible for it's making. As I said above, it's raw and gritty, but also very funny in some parts, and touching in others. It's an entertaining piece, and one that will likely find it's way into my indie top 10.",1311984000,4,1324,4.364372469635628
4233394,5,B003Z8ZCDY,"I've wanted to see this movie for a while now, and finally got my hands on a copy from Amazon. Netflix apparently doesn't know WHEN this movie will come out on their site... but hopefully it will be soon because more people need to see this movie!
I am usually not into indie flicks. There I said it. But this one had me hooked from the start! It has all the makings that spell success for a big budget films, and yet I think that this movie was even better because it has a raw, gritty and real feel to it.
I won't go into detail, so there will be no spoilers here, but there are some scenes where my skin was crawling along with Olivia's, and scenes where I could feel Tomo's strife over his mother. Every character had something I liked about them, even the bad guys!
Speaking of liking characters, I really feel that the cast was just right! Especially Jun Suenaga as Tomo and Aya Cash as Olga.
There was a great blend of humor, suspense, drama and action throughout this movie! I'll be looking for more like this in the future!",1300147200,4,1032,4.270408163265306
4233395,4,B003Z8ZCDY,"When I think of indie movies, I think of artsy, anti-mainstream films. ""Off Jackson Avenue"" is not like that. It can be considered a straight-up action flick intended to entertain. Sex and violence are important parts of the plots, most of the main characters are criminals -- whether by choice or not -- and there are humorous moments interspersed throughout. This is not to say it is not intelligent. Far from it. There are 3 story lines with distinct tones and characters. All of these story lines offer something for us viewers to think about, although the film never makes overt political or social statements. We have become accustomed to expect multiple plots within a movie to somehow connect and offer us some sort of closure in the end, and ""Off Jackson Avenue"" does not betray that expectation. But the way the characters come in contact with one another was not what I subconsciously expected. They cross paths, rather than converge, which I found quite refreshing. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Sure, you can tell it is a low-budget production, but that does not detract at all from this well-written, well-performed, sort of a thinking-man's-action-flick indie film.",1297814400,2,1183,5.01015228426396
4233396,5,B003Z8ZCDY,"My wife took me to the premier of this film in the East Village back in 09.  I wasn't expecting much from an unknown producer but five minutes into the movie, I found myself hooked!  I remember having to go to the restroom so bad but chose to hold it in through the entire movie.  Montias never took his foot off of the gas in this story that circles around the sordid world of kidnapping, the sex slave trade and of course murder.  His cast of off beat characters include a Mexican heroine, an Armenian mobster, a Japanese hit man, Chinatown gangsters, a crooked broker and a dirty cop.  They all collide yet co-exist in this tale that can only happen on the back streets of NYC.  This story was creepy yet quite authentic; funny but only where it had to be and had a wonderful shocker at the end.  If you didn't know who John Luke Montias was before, you will now.  Well done!",1295308800,7,878,4.278787878787878
4233397,4,B003Z8ZCDY,Great flick!  Does the innocent overcome the predators?  A lot goes on in the underbelly of NYC!!!,1483315200,,98,4.705882352941177

4233406,4,B003Z8ZCDY,"Fun movie to watch with an interesting smorgasbord of intertwining stories, characters and events culminating in an unpredictable and gratifying ending. At times, the content, characters and scenes are grisly but never in a pandering sort of way but rather to capture the starkness of the characters. The actors were all very good and believable in their roles. Great little movie!",1456876800,3,381,5.262295081967213

4233414,1,B003Z8ZCDY,"that was just plain GARBAGE....
This was like some stupid kid found the Pulp Fiction movie script and decided to use it for his HS drama club presentation using all the local LOSER talent he could find. The acting was atrocious and the plots were just plain stupid. The japanese hitman ( an English teacher from Japan...yeah 'nuff said) was a joke of a character who was weak and lame - with a mommy fixation to boot. The Italian idiot carjacker was just plain stupid and deserved everything that happened to him. The Mexican chick was annoyingly stupid in the beginning but at least she showed some balls at the end. I was actually happy for her and Olga when they got away (the plot was still stupid but at least they got away). The Albanians were just plain clueless, both in character and acting skills ... it was hard to believe that they even made it that long and far without being killed off by some other group of rejects. All in all, one lousy, stupid movie you should steer clear of unless you enjoy crappy plots and horrible acting. If you do, then by all means, knock yourself out...
BTW this is like the SEVENTH time I am trying to leave this review with Amazon saying they can't post it...how clean does this review have to be...am I writing this for kindergarteners???? Gimme a break already doode...geezus...",1439596800,,1325,4.548117154811716

4233423,2,B003Z8ZCDY,"A disjointed, badly shot slug of a film, without one single character who deserves attention.  That these issues have become more pressing in our society, is stupid. The ""trades"" have been known and recorded throughout history. Now that everything is a cause or a cautionary tale, the public is lured in to believing this is something new. It's not, we just have the capability to witness more of this criminal behavior openly, thanks to technology.  In this case though, technology didn't exactly do us a favor.  Garbage like this needs to be left unseen.  Just another view of a society taking its last dump before extinction.  It was stupid and left viewer hanging.",1433548800,,668,4.876106194690266

4233429,4,B003Z8ZCDY,"This is one of those rare low-budget films with interesting characters and original story that is actually good.  There's a lot going on in this film, but it never gets away from itself. Olgas Russian accent is a little far-fetched and thick and comes in and out, revealing  she is actually a pretty white actress from Jersey..The Japanese hit man brings with him his own cultural belief in ghosts, giving us momentarily what seems a lost episode from The Ring franchise. The film is grainy, gritty and low budget, and the street scenes would have been so much better if theyd have had a dolly instead of holding the camera on their shoulders and walking or running.  The plot, however, is high class, because it is fresh, original, and multicultural.  This is a good one, don't miss it!",1429401600,,787,4.681159420289855

All the actors did a good job, the entire cast. Loved that it was about the story, not just a bunch of special effects like all the ""blockbusters."" Just a really fun story with a cast of crazy crazy characters. If something was improbable, that's ok, the characters were believable and consistent. Have fun.",1426982400,2,439,4.7894736842105265

This movie had me on the edge of my seat through it's entirety the same as a Tarantino or Lynch film and that is saying something. For a low-budget indie, it goes toe to toe in the teeth-grinding, nail-biting departments as much as Pulp Fiction or Blue Velvet. But where Tarantino's films contain almost no allegory, Lynch's films (except for maybe Blue Velvet) are almost all allegorical. OJA is somewhere to the right of center; it is entirely believable (which is very sad, indeed) but has it's allegorical ""moments.""

Queens is a cesspool. I should know having lived there for years. I guess synchronicity works on the dark side as well as the light although I wouldn't want the karmic debt that some of these soulless, psychopathic wretches should owe. Even after they're dead.
