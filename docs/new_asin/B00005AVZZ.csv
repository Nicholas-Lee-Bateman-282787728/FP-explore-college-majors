7936077,4,B00005AVZZ,"Okay, so you can tell it's low-budget, but if you're looking for a fun movie to watch at a sleepover, this is it! I loved the casting choices.",1439769600,,142,4.107142857142857
7936078,5,B00005AVZZ,The one time Tori Spelling showed any talent. Funny movie to watch.,1413676800,,67,4.666666666666667

7936080,4,B00005AVZZ,"This is comedy gold. If you're looking for a fun movie to watch that isn't too serious but still has great acting, get this one! Tori is amazing as a mentally unstable girl, and her two ""perpetrators"" are hilariously hopeless. The only downside was that one of the lead guys has a lisp, which tends to get annoying.",1390694400,,315,4.448275862068965
7936081,1,B00005AVZZ,I thought it was going to be really good because most of Tori's movies are great but it was terrible!,1377734400,,101,4.1
7936082,1,B00005AVZZ,"This movie is soooo boring and soooo stupid it's a pain to watch.  The only good thing in this movie is Tori Spelling, she's kinna funny but her acting is not good enough to save this movie.",1081900800,2,190,4.135135135135135
7936083,5,B00005AVZZ,"even this movie was not very well known it is still one of my favorite movies in my dvd collection and of all time. here is a little lowdown on ""perpetrators of the crime.""
3 would be kidnappers, Phil, Ed and Jones decide to kidnap a girl by the name of Pauline Henderson. Pauline comes from a wealthy family. the money they are supposed get from Mr. Henderson (Pauline's dad) which is one million dollars wouldn't even make a dent in his bank account. so during the kidnapping they figure out they've got Lucy.the wrong girl. Lucy seems to be perfectly nice and normal just as long as she's taking her medicine. Oh did i mention the kidnappers left the medicine behind.
So i would recommend thin movie to a serious comedy lover. It is worth the money. trust me!!!!!!!!!",1074384000,5,770,4.507142857142857
