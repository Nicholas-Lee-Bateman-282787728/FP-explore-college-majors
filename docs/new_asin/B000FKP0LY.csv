8123967,5,B000FKP0LY,"Wild West Tech is an hour long show with commercials and in every episode they deal with a certain technology from the wild west. They discuss how it was used, who used it and how it changed the west. There are some jokes thrown in here and there which are pretty chessy but still funny. The re-enactments are good and enjoyable.

This episode deals with how the lawmen of the west executed criminals and how they invented new ways of doing it as well. They discuss hangin's, firing squads, the electric chair and some other things and with each invention there is a story about a man who experienced one of these deaths.

My only problem is that they only offer each show individualy instead as a series with all the episodes together. This is a good show for any one who has a general interest in wild west history or the type of technology that was used in those times.",1181174400,4,872,4.409937888198757
