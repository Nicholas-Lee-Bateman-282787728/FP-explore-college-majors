4947243,4,B0063NQTR6,"I grew up in Texas, and my parents are from Ohio, and I'm a Florida State grad so I've seen some powerhouse football rivalries,  I had no idea that the Auburn/Alabama rivalry was so deep.  Great insight into the history of the two schools.  Must see for all football fans.",1358208000,,272,4.4

4947247,2,B0063NQTR6,"This vid is poor compared to the rest of 30 for 30. Seriously, who really cares about a bunch of hillbillies knocking themselves senseless? It's what they do.",1344643200,,158,4.678571428571429
4947248,4,B0063NQTR6,This is a great story about the rivarly between Alabama and Auburn.  Either fan will enjoy each moment described by past players and coaches with a greater understanding of the intense rivarly.  It also sheds some light on how a dedicated fan can go to far.  Updyke should be arrested and placed in prison for a very long time!  Also how a rivarly can be forgetton for a moment when tradegy strikes with the devasting tornado in Birmingham.  The Auburn family went to Tucaloosa to help those families in need but still the rivarly remains.......,1336953600,5,545,4.6947368421052635
4947249,1,B0063NQTR6,Be wary of the bad language if you are thinking about puchasing this item. It is inappropriate for many people.,1336867200,3,111,4.6
4947250,5,B0063NQTR6,I'm not a huge football fan but I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. I started watching the Oklahoma Sooners so my Dad and I would have something to talk about. Then started branching out to other teams. There are some fans who won't like this but I liked Auburn AND Alabama. It tells the history of the Iron Bowl and the rivalry between the two teams. A lot of good stuff like Alabama's first Heisman and the controversy over the hiring of Auburn's Coach Gene Chizik. This is entertaining for anyone who watches college football.,1327276800,7,532,4.670212765957447

4947276,4,B0063NQTR6,I grew up in the great state of Alabama. My dad was an Auburn fan. I became an Alabama fan. This documentary describes the rivalry accurately.,1388793600,,142,4.5
4947277,5,B0063NQTR6,For BAMA or Auburn football fans this is a well made documentary of the  culture and competition between two SEC in-state rivals that take major NCAA football very seriously.  It has a 2011 copyright and has been shown a number of times on ESPN but I bought it to keep in my media library and have sent it as a Christmas present to BAMA fans.  Good value for the money and the footage and interviews bring back lots of fond memories of BAMA and the BAMA/Auburn rivalry.,1388620800,,469,4.367816091954023
4947278,4,B0063NQTR6,"I have lived in the state of Alabama for 29 years and the Iron Bowl rivalry is something that is near and dear to my heart, both the good and the bad. So, when I first heard that ESPN was making a documentary about our little family feud, I was definitely excited to watch it. I enjoyed it...but I was also disappointed by it. Don't get me wrong, this is a very entertaining and fun documentary, with a lot to identify with whether you're a Bama fan, a Tiger, or just a football fan. The problem I had with the documentary was the time given to the fans' intense hatred for each other. The majority of the DVD focuses around the bad blood and personal dislike between the two schools and their fans. This is an important part of the story, to be sure, but I would have preferred more attention to the history of the game itself. The Iron Bowl has enough illustrious history with enough memorable games (the 80s and 90s games were such a part of my childhood), fantastic plays (Punt Bama Punt, Bo Over the Top, etc.) and extraordinary players (Shaun Alexander, Bo Jackson, Pat Sullivan, etc.) that more attention could have paid to the game itself and less to the craziness that surrounds it every year. I can tell you from someone that lives in Alabama that the documentary does not exaggerate, this is all accurate, and is a part of life 365 days a year. But watching the documentary unfortunately reminded me why I decided to be a PAC-10 fan years ago instead of reminding me why I've always enjoyed the rivalry. So, in closing: don't let my review put you off giving this a watch, I loved it. I just wished that it had given more time to the game and less to the insane people that live in my state - and you may too. War Eagle, Roll Tide, Go Huskies! ;)",1386633600,5,1757,4.327272727272727
4947279,5,B0063NQTR6,I am an Auburn graduate. Half of my in-laws are Auburn fans and the other half are Tide fans. This film is an unbiased look at tradition and heart that both of these teams share in Alabama. Perfect gift for the whole family.,1370822400,4,224,4.232558139534884
