8421344,5,B004B3EIW8,"Even if you're not an inveterate Mickey Mantle fan (there really are such people), you'll love this DVD. Mantle was an icon the likes of which may never pass our way again. He was tremendously talented, arguably the best baseball player who ever lived, and at the same time tremendously flawed. He played baseball like few have ever rivaled, but his time off the field was spent mostly in bars or bedrooms. Despite his monumental success in all these areas, he could never quite understand the fascination baseball fans had for him. Such was his modesty. I recall Bobby Mercer saying that when he first went up to the Yankees, the PA guy would announce, ""Now coming to bat, Bobby Mercer."" At that point the crowd would go wild. These Yankee Stadium fans are fantastic, Mercer thought, not realizing for quite a while that the cheering was meant for Mickey Mantle who was just coming out of the dugout to the on-deck circle. Not many baseball players were as talented, yet modest as Mickey Mantle and I believe that's what makes him such an icon. This DVD gives you a wonderful recap of one of the greatest legends of our time.",1445817600,,1126,4.606965174129353

8421346,5,B004B3EIW8,"If your a Mickey Mantle Fan this is one you""ll hold next to your heart! World series 1955. Place Roosevelt Grade School Grand Forks North Dakota. We had a lady teacher ask us for a vote as to who we liked best, The Brooklyn Dodgers or the New York Yankees? Some 80% voted Dodgers. Well they were young and stupid what can you say. My dad and I lived alone in a house directly behind the school. He packed his lunch bucket every morning prepare me a breakfast and head off to work for the Great Northern Railroad. My father was everything to me and it was not for me to do him wrong. But for this first time I committed evil and skipped school to watch Mantle those Yankees! I got the show of my 9 year old life and saw first hand the first no hitter in a World Series by Yankee Don Larson over those dredges of Dodgers! One thing in physics You do not skip school at Roosevelt Grade School without the parent finding out, Sorta like Home Land Security. Two weeks later father and I were parked next to the school's ball field leaning on the trunk of his car watching the kids play ball. ""Ken"" I looked up, and dad was looking yet at the game. ""Bet that was something to see Don Larson put those Dodgers away for the series.""  ""ah yes Dad."" With that he took his key and opened the trunk, reached in and handed his boy a new first basemen's glove with a ""go get em."" I'm 70 and yet when I watch Ken Burns Baseball of the 50's and 60's nine years old. Thank you Dad. Ken Bendickson Albany, Oregon",1388707200,,1494,4.134020618556701

A very interesting production for old and new fans, including many interviews with ""forgotten"" heroes/teammates like Ryne Duren, hank Bauer, and Phil Linz. A nearly perfect narration keeps the flow going. quiet, understated. Intelligent use of old clips.

For the deep fan/historian, there are some glaring errors, though they are assumed to be not much more than copy typos: Mantle hit .353 in his first MVP year, not .356. His career did *not* go progressively down after 1964. He had a good year in 1966, including a stretch when he hit 8 homers in 6 games! He was not 38 when he retired, he was 37.

Another small issue: the DVD title is a bit misleading. His ""own words"" are only from a 1953 on field interview and a circa. 1993 chat at ""Mickey Mantle's"" in NYC. (until youtube, the '53 clip was rarer than rare). A better title would have been: Mantle: The Great Teammate And The Great team.",1329264000,,916,4.6419753086419755
