8435607,1,B004M6UKLW,"This is an extremely boring annoying video that I consider not educational and a waste of money. They made it long, long, long to fill out space. It is not a pretty video for children. It was boring since the very beginning. It seems the persons who make this video tried to fill out space with anything from very long songs, unnecessary interviews, and other images that make it difficult for a child to learn anything from it. It has some ugly videos, some words such as ghost, and witch (fantasma y bruja) that I do not care to introduce my child at this moment. I wish I has known it before. It is a petty this video in Spanish is so different from the Leap frog that are a really good complement to the parents education. I tried, but I cannot watch this video. It is a torture and the price so high!",1454112000,,805,4.233766233766234
8435608,5,B004M6UKLW,"This is Spanish Phonics! I don't have any more specific details to add! But my child and I both very much enjoy this video!! I hope they create more Spanish Videos to sell on Amazon! Me Gusta Ser Yo is our favorite, but, wow, this is fast becoming her new favorite! ; )
We need more of these videos! THey are incredible! I wonder if there is English captions for those difficult ""hard of Spanish"" instead of Hard of hearing? My TV is supposed to do fantastic stuff with Caption (So it says) but it seems to just put zero caption on any (ANY) of my spanish videos, except Disney's Tangled! That's awesome! Dubbed in Spanish! I Love it! I wonder if i can find more videos dub in Spanish on Amazon? ANy suggestions?",1318896000,,712,4.32089552238806
