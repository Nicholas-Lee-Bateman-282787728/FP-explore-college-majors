7996910,3,B0000AGQ5S,"I'm sure this set of three DVDs would be a hit if all the DVDs in the set worked. The two of them that played all the way through were enjoyable. One was defective, therefore it's hard to give a high grade evaluation for this particular set. The response to this issue has been a bit confusing and unhelpful so far, therefore, the service does not as yet get a high evaluation either. I'm still wondering if I should have sent the whole thing back for a full refund, and not just the one defective DVD as I was instructed to do.",1372118400,,528,4.186274509803922
