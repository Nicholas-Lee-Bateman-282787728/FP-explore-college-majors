8237292,5,B00106CH5Y,Wonderful video on the State of Maine.  Beautiful aerial photography and narration.  See Maine from above and as you never have before.,1481760000,,135,5.090909090909091
8237293,5,B00106CH5Y,"I remember seeing this on tv years ago and loved it the first time I saw it.  As a born and raised Mainer, I love my state and appreciate all it's beauty.  I happened to see this on VHS at a camp rental in Rangeley over Memorial weekend and quickly ordered it for myself on DVD.  I watched it soon after it arrived and between the scenery and the music and even the narration of the show, it actually brought tears to my eyes.  So beautiful and so glad that I live in this state.",1467072000,,479,4.010526315789473

8237295,5,B00106CH5Y,A must if you are going to Maine,1423526400,,32,3.125
8237296,4,B00106CH5Y,"This is an enjoyable view of Maine. You'll see places you've been, and find new places you want to visit. I was looking to see if it was a video I could use in class to show the different distinct regions in the state, though. Not so helpful for that. First, you're rarely told where in the state the places are. Second, the trip through the state is random, and focused on themes, like lighthouses or lakes.  Not a criticism, mind you. Just didn't work for the purpose I wanted.",1412121600,,479,4.322222222222222
8237297,4,B00106CH5Y,"To anyone who dreams of seeing Maine someday I truly recommend High on Maine. Very interesting and well done. Gives one a very good idea of the details of the state. Being done from the air is a different vantage point that not everyone sees. I will actually probably watch it again, maybe even a few times.",1397520000,,307,4.4035087719298245
8237298,5,B00106CH5Y,I am from Maine and this is a very good tape.  It shows you places that you can't always see.  It gives you a history of the state and great scenery.,1367971200,,149,3.774193548387097
