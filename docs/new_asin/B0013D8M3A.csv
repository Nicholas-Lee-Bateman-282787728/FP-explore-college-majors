3103655,5,B0013D8M3A,"I haven't done a pilates DVD for a while but this is definitely a breath of fresh air and even challenging but not so much that I had to stop or couldn't do something. There is plenty of familliar pilates exercises like criss cross , roll up etc. and the ball add extra resistance to those exercises. There is even a lunge move with one leg on the ball behind which was pretty challenging. Lara does a great job explaining everything and doesn't waste time and moves straight from exercise to exercise in those 10 minute segments. My favorite segements were the lower body one , with those lunges and a series of bridge work on the ball that fried my hamstrings and the stretch which was great.",1221350400,6,694,4.4296875
3103656,5,B0013D8M3A,I think this dvd was well worth the price.  It is a good workout!,1220227200,,65,3.642857142857143
3103657,5,B0013D8M3A,"Here is another great 10 minute solution DVD from one of the best pilates instructors.  This DVD builds a little from Lara Hudson's 10 Minutes Solution Pilates DVD.  She cues very well and takes her time, which enables the user to be more relaxed and graceful.  What I like about her Pilates on the Ball is that she's creative with her exercise routines.  I would probably not see some of her moves in other DVD's.  She makes it look so easy while holding the ball still while I keep falling off.  She often tells you that the ball ""will get away from you"", so you won't feel so bad.  She's very encouraging and very detailed in her explanations.  If she comes out with another DVD on pilates, I would get it.",1219276800,,709,4.358778625954199
3103658,3,B0013D8M3A,"The good bit: I found that the DVD was well structured with 10 min sequences that provide a good workout at an intermediate to advanced level.
The not so good bit: I personally found the music and atmosphere of the DVD rather hectic, that is to say not relaxing, and rather lacking the elegance and harmony of what Pilates, in my opinion, is all about.
I would not recommend this video for beginners as it is rather lacking in cues for breathing, and seems to assume a prior knowledge of the techniques of employing one's core strength.",1215302400,28,536,4.536082474226804
3103659,5,B0013D8M3A,This is a great workout tape. Easy to follow. I enjoy all Lara Hudson's workouts,1212019200,8,80,4.4
3103660,5,B0013D8M3A,"I have practically all of the 10 minute dvds, and the vast majority are great and this is one of them.  It's cued very well by Lara and it's in the usual format of four workouts and a great 10 minute stretch segment.
Obviously, each segment makes use of a stability ball and that enhances the effectiveness of the workouts.  It's great for your core and they use it in here to help increase your range of motion and it adds a balance element.  My favourite workout here is the abs section and like all the other workouts they do, you can program the workout to be done in any order or do only one or two or three etc workouts in one hit.  It really is a no excuse workout because anyone can find the minimum of 10 minutes, and before you know it, you might even increase it to the maximum 50 minutes and while you're doing this, you're having fun.  Lara is a great instructor and motivating too.
I highly recommend this to practically everyone.  It's mainly intermediate to advanced, but doing shorter sections, beginners can gain a lot here too.  It's great for a total body workout and it's fun.  I enjoy it and hope you will too.",1209168000,50,1132,4.306603773584905
3103661,5,B0013D8M3A,"I began working out 4 years ago when I tried the 10 Minute Solutions Pilates DVDs and have been hooked on the series ever since.  I have tried other pilates (and other workouts) DVDs, but few have been as fun, enjoyable or effective as those in the 10 Minute Solutions series and this new one is no different.  I love the idea of using the ball in pilates, as it presents more challenging ways to get more out of the classic moves and it provides more innovative moves that are not as common.  I really love all sections of this DVD.  They are as follows:

Pilates for Abs-This section focuses of course on the abs, but the ball intensifies the movements.  The other thing I enjoyed was that while I was familiar with many of the moves, there were some that were new or that put a new spin on the classic moves.

Lower Body Pilates-One of the areas of the body that I find especially hard to work is the inner thighs.  This workout enables me to focus on them as well as the rest of my lower body.

Upper Body Pilates-I was expecting to use weights with this section, as with the other 10 Minute Solutions Fitness Ball workout, but was surprised when they were not going to be utilized.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to work my upper body effectively or efficiently without weights, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This workout is a departure from many upper body workouts that I have done and really enjoyed it.

Pilates for Flexibility- This section I used at the end of my workout.  It was very relaxing and I could feel the muscles stretch after a very challenging 40 minute workout.  I can see me just popping this on after a hard day at the office.  It is relaxing, but stretches and relaxes all of your muscles very well.

Total Body Pilates-It's just that, a great mixture of exercises to tone and work the entire body.  I really thought there was a nice variety of moves to work every area very well.

Overall, I completely recommend this workout. I consider myself at an intermediate/advanced level and I found this to be very challenging.  Some of the exercises that are more difficult I will have to work up to, so I can continue to advance with this DVD.  I also love the instructor.  She was pleasant without being obnoxious.  Her cuing and instruction was impeccable.  This will be in regular rotation in my workout schedule.  I can't wait to see what other gems will be released in this series.",1207958400,86,2415,4.424036281179139

Here's the accurate one:

I love the 10 minute video series! This DVD is wonderful because it incorporates a stability ball into the pilates moves. It makes them tougher and also gives you a better stretch. I don't have any other pilates props, so using a ball is great to enhance my exercises. FYI: the DVD did not come with a ball, so make sure you have one of your own. I already did, so it was no problem. I use this video frequently.",1457481600,,533,4.33

3103730,3,B0013D8M3A,"Previous to purchasing this workout DVD, I was not familiar with the 10 Minute Solutions line of videos, so I didn't quite know what to expect with such short workouts. There are definitely some valuable moves in here, and it could be good for someone who really can't fit a full workout in. However, I didn't even work up a sweat. I've only used the DVD once because I figured that if I couldn't even feel it, there was no point in doing it. I do work out about 3 times a week, so it is likely that I'm beyond this level of exercise. I'd recommend it for those just starting to get back into exercise and need to build up endurance. On the other hand, if you are like me and exercise regularly, this product will likely bore you.",1447200000,3,730,4.2214285714285715

10 Minute Solution - convenient and challenging
Pilates + Ball - great combination

I am a near-daily exerciser, using Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, Jessica Smith, Amy Dixon, etc. I love the 10-Minute Solution DVDs, especially the Pilates offerings. Lara Hudson is always great with the cuing and explanation of moves. Every one of her DVDs - at least the ones I've tried - are nicely paced and well explained. I received a stability ball for Christmas and I absolutely love this DVD. It is challenging enough that I couldn't do every single move the first (or second) time, but it doesn't seem impossible that I might master these moves at some point.

I consider myself a ""solid beginner"" level at pilates and yoga - I can do all of the beginner exercises well and some of the intermediate ones.  But this video was HARD!!  It pretty much combined the hardest exercises from the other two videos, and added more challenges.  I was able to do enough of the exercises to make me sweat bullets and get an intense workout, but it will take me a while to be able to do all of these.  Despite the difficulty, I really enjoy the exercises and I think it will be very fun once I'm strong enough to do them well.  Plus, Lara is a great instructor with perfect cues.

I do four parts in sequence (abs, lower body, upper body, total body), time just flies by and I feel great afterwards.

A month later I picked it up again and tried. To my suprise I may actually be able to go back to work because of this video. It stengthens the abs and allows you to sit up straighter. I love that it is 10 min for each exercise section- lower body, upper body, total pilates, abs, and flexibility. The fact that each lasts 10 min means that you are working so hard but that you know it will come to an end soon and not to give up. No joke, thousands of dollars later, an 8 dollar video solves my problems! Physical therapy and other back dvds were way to weak of exercises to make a lick of a difference.

3103854,4,B0013D8M3A,"Like other reviewers, I was rather surprised at just how hectic the workouts here can be--I was rather reminded of the P90X yoga session in its intensity.  I'm of the view that pilates should be a bit less speedy and this is the sort of program that seems to prefer to take a more quiet form of excercise and see how jazz it can slap into it.  So if you're stubborn about having a quiet, peaceful, and slow pilates program, it might be wise to try another DVD.  But if you were thinking a 10-Minute Solution is all about cramming in the exercise and are okay with that, this should be quite pleasing.

The program is separated into 5 ten-minute worksouts, each with a specific objective.  All of them are fun and effective, though I recommend this DVD to those with some prior Pilates training as the workout does move fast.  The programs are so easy to mix and match and, of course, they are all nice and short so even if you have time for one, you're good.  The advice and training is practical and easy-to-understand, and the moves are clearly demonstrated.

3103856,4,B0013D8M3A,"Here is what I love about workouts like this, you can choose your own workout-I can do 10 minutes if I just have a small break in my day, combine a few of the workouts or do the whole thing for a killer 50 minute workout.  These types of workouts are so good for making ""I can't find time"" an excuse of the past.  I found this dvd to be challenging with the ball (I do pilates dvds but pilates/ball is a whole different thing...).  The ball adds in the extra challenge of keeping steady while you are doing very controlled moves that target abs, upper and lower body or that work on your flexibility.  I am pretty decent at regular pilates, but I was an ""I Love Lucy"" episode on some of these moves, with shaky, bad shopping cart wheel types of movements rolling the ball in and out while my rear end was off the ground and I actually lost a grip a time or two when the ball was over my head, for a hilarious face bounce....hello, could we be an more uncoordinated at this?  Throughout though you are really toning your abs, and you do get better as you move through the exercises.  Do not let the 10 minute solution title make you think this is an easy work-out though.  You are challenged and I would consider this to be a intermediate to somewhat advanced workout for some of the moves. I would say this dvd is not for a beginner to pilates or the ball workouts.  If you are open to trying and failing a little I would give it a go.  I exercise daily but would say the ball workouts are sometimes a challenge if I haven't done them in a while, but they are oh so effective at toning.

Overall, a good workout to help you build your core and work on balance.  Nothing tones the tummy more than Pilates and with the ball you are giving your workout a bit of a boost.

The instructor is extremely clear throughout the entire video, making sure you know exactly how to get into position and when to breathe.  She moves quickly to make the most of the short segments, but spends enough time on each position that you definitely feel it.  The strength required to do these exercises correctly (staying strong, keeping the ball controlled) may preclude beginners from enjoying this.  However, beginners can certainly understand and follow along, as no prior pilates or exercise knowledge is required.  I have worked out consistently, but never done pilates before.  When I purchased it, I thought ten minutes did not seem long enough for each section, but when I'm doing them, it seems too long.

The only section that doesn't benefit from the 10-minute format is the stretching section; there are a lot of stretches in the segment, and to get to them all, she moves fairly quickly, more quickly than I like to go when I'm stretching.  However, I simply pause the DVD whenever I want and extend the stretch time to my liking.

If you're interested in challenging yourself, using that exercise ball you bought and is in the closet, getting toned and flexible, and especially if you are busy and need to work out creatively, purchase this.",1308009600,10,1400,4.969957081545064
3103860,4,B0013D8M3A,"There are 5 work outs in this video that you can play separately like chapters: abs, lower, upper, full, and flexibility.

About the difficulty level: I'm in reasonable shape. I've go on and off of light morning exercise routines, and I tend to be generally active (biking to work, morning walks, yoga classes ect.) but I'm not a fitness buff. I've done a little bit of pilates before. I just did 4 out of the 5 workouts (I didn't do upper body). I found all of the exercises except one (were you go up into a shoulder stand with the ball between your legs, using only your abs no arms) doable. The one I couldn't do I adjusted. I thought the level was pretty reasonable for someone who is in decent shape (not too difficult or too easy). I don't think this is an intermediate level video.

I liked the breath guide, but it could have been louder. Sometimes I wasn't sure how I was supposed to breath. The music was really quiet, and the tone was pretty low key. The pace is good. I found the breathing, and the reps matched well when I figured out what she was doing.

The timing in the flexibility was too fast. The stretches were done at a similar rate to the exercise reps. I don't think this is very effective. I had to do them at my own pace. However the choices of stretches was good.

Overall a good workout. I prefer a more up beat instructor.

Does anyone know of a similar video I could get with a really up beat peppy (even cheerleaderish) instructor? I had a video like this that I lost (but really liked). It seems like this isn't as popular these days. Maybe there is a used dvd from the 80s or 90s that someone could recommend.

3103881,5,B0013D8M3A,"A great twist on pilates exercises. I've done this DVD from start to finish a few times already and it's so much fun! As with the other Lara Hudson's pilates DVDs, time flies and before you know it the workout is over.

The butt/thigh segment is good. The stretching segment at the end is quite decent - probably the best I've seen so far in the 10 Minute Solutions series. I particularly liked using the ball for hip stretches - I now use always use it as a prop for that particular stretch.

I would warn beginners off this DVD though: get a few months of regular pilates/yoga under your belt before attempting this workout. It would be quite easy to hurt yourself in some of the balance exercises, or just trying to keep up with Lara. If you are a beginner and do insist on trying this DVD, make sure you do all the exercises at your own pace and not that of the instructor - it's better to do two repetitions correctly than rush through several and pull a muscle in the process.",1300752000,5,982,4.302702702702702

3103883,4,B0013D8M3A,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

First off, people probably either like working with the ball or they don't.  It can be hard to control at first and you have to get used to it.  For some people, this is worth the effort since you have to use a lot of control over your own muscles to control the ball, for others, it is too frustrating and not worth the potential learning curve.  So those who scored the workout badly because they did not like working with the ball did not give this workout a fair assessment.

That said, I thought this was one of the better ball workouts I've tried.  A lot of pilates moves seem to work well with the ball.  The weakest segment was the ab segment --- while I understand using pilates moves for a pilates workout, one of the best things about the ball is the regular situp action you can get with it and these moves paled in comparison.  The strongest and most surprising segment was the upper body workout using your body weight and the ball.  I find most pilates workouts are rather weak in this area and the ball definitely improved this aspect.

Lastly, I like this instructor and have tried other 10 minute pilates workouts by her.  I find her instructions are clear and well-cued.",1300147200,5,1245,4.440528634361233

3103914,5,B0013D8M3A,"I started incorporating the stability ball in all my workouts about 4 years ago, and pilates about 6 years now.  When I found workouts that combined the 2 I was amazed at the results!  Nothing can compare to the results you'll get in your core.  My abs have never been so defined, and in a much shorter time than the traditional crunches.  Plus these exercises really help with stability and coordination in your everyday life!

I started using the 10 Minute Solution workouts about a year ago, and i'm hooked!  There is so much flexibility in your workouts.  You can customize it to your time limits or the areas you want to concentrate on that day.  This Pilates on the Ball DVD is my favorite 10 Minute Solution by far.  This workout is great because you don't need any other equipment such as hand weights.  I've even purchased an extra stability ball that I keep at work so that I can do this workout on my lunch break.  It's great for short time frames like that.  You can also do 1 of the workouts in the morning and another later in the day to get a full workout in any short amount of time you have in a hectic schedule like mine.

I would say this is a beginner/intermediate type workout, however if you've never done any type of pilates workouts before i'd recommend getting an instructional video that really breaks down how to execute pilates moves properly.  Without the fundamentals you won't get as much out of this or any pilates workout.  There are several DVDs that really teach you the basics.  I used the Windsor pilates beginner instructional video to learn the basics.  I'm so glad I have that information, otherwise i'd only get half the results that I do now.

Usually I alternate this workout with the 10 Minute Solution:  Fitness Ball Workouts DVD to keep my body from getting the plateau effect.  But this workout is my favorite of the 2.  If you want good definiton in your body, especially your abs, I would highly recommend this workout!",1270339200,2,1968,4.534090909090909

3103916,5,B0013D8M3A,"I ordered this video online after redaing some of the reviews and was a beginner but I figured I'd gve it a shot!

The first segment I did was the 10 mintue Abs workout and let me tell you, my abs were quivering and shaking from minute one!  After the 10 minutes of wailing on my abs I just wanted to lay on the floor and strech!  The next day, my stomach was SORE and I don't know about anyone else's body but it takes a lot for my abs to really feel a workout but I felt this one!

I was too sore the next day to try the abs again so I thought I would do the upper body/lower body segment.  Much to my delight (yea right), by using the ball you are engaging your core muscles during almost every exercise.  I fell over a few times while in plank on the ball and my abs were very sore but I did the lower and upper segement and then by day 3 my whole body was sore, haha!

Getting my body into a routine of using this 3-4 times a week has been very beneficial though.  Your body becomes much stronger very quickly and after the soreness fades, you're left with tightening muscles, better posture, balance and - for me - no more lower back pain.

I used to wake up so stiff in the morning, but using the ball and the core engagement you get from pilates, I'm able to support myself better and I wake up feeling great.

I'd recommend this to anyone, even if you're a beginner.  You won't have perfect form when you stanr and it's hard, but you're at home so who cares who sees you looking goofy at fisrt.  You'll see results fast!",1264464000,3,1529,4.043189368770764

I have reached for this DVD many times when I want to do some core work.

Her soothing voice will prompt you from one exercise to another.  If at first you don't succeed, practice some more and you'll get it.  I always thought doing exercise on the ball was a lazy person's way of doing things.  Not so.  It is very difficult to balance one's body on the ball.  It challenges you to hold still (and thus firming up your abs) without having the ball moving away from you.  Definitely not easy but very, VERY, effective!

3103931,4,B0013D8M3A,"This is my first ""10 Minute Solution"" DVD and I am impressed.  I was skeptical but it's well put-together and you do get a good workout in 10 minutes, or a more thorough workout if you combine the segments.

THE GOOD:
The strength here is Lara, the instructor.  As a physical therapist I really appreciate that her form is stellar, and her cueing is spot on.  She may not be the most charismatic person but she knows what she's doing.

The other strength is the format: 10 minutes is easy to find in your day, and it goes so fast that I almost always wind up doing two or three 10-minute segments.  There are four toning segments: Abs, Upper Body, Lower Body, Total Body - and one Flexibility segment.  You can combine them in any way you choose, although of course you want to do the stretching at the end.  The flexibility here, as well as the ease of fitting the workout into your day, make this a workout DVD that stays in my rotation.

THE COULD-BE-BETTER:
This is not a workout for beginners.  I know they don't say that it is... but they don't say it isn't either, and I think that beginners may be attracted to the ""10 Minutes"".  The workout intensity level is intermediate, but some of the moves are fairly advanced and difficult to perform correctly.  This is not for anyone new to exercise.  I think this should be stated on the box and also in the short intro clip.

There is no warm-up or closing stretch.  Obviously, there's no time for them, I don't have a problem with that.  But again, the intro clip should explain not to start a workout cold, and to do either the 'flexibility' segment or your own stretches afterward.

A little bit boring - Lara is very monotone.

BOTTOM LINE:
A good workout that's extremely well cued, and extremely customizable according to your schedule and fitness level.  2 or 3 segments together will give an intermediate exerciser a tough workout, 4 or 5 segments together provide an advanced workout.  Caution: Make sure you stretch afterward, and this is too advanced for the truly new beginner.",1247011200,10,2042,4.542465753424658

My favorite segements were the lower body one , with those lunges and a series of bridge work on the ball that fried my hamstrings and the stretch which was great.",1221350400,6,694,4.4296875

3338154,5,B0013D8M3A,"Here is another great 10 minute solution DVD from one of the best pilates instructors.  This DVD builds a little from Lara Hudson's 10 Minutes Solution Pilates DVD.  She cues very well and takes her time, which enables the user to be more relaxed and graceful.  What I like about her Pilates on the Ball is that she's creative with her exercise routines.  I would probably not see some of her moves in other DVD's.  She makes it look so easy while holding the ball still while I keep falling off.  She often tells you that the ball ""will get away from you"", so you won't feel so bad.  She's very encouraging and very detailed in her explanations.  If she comes out with another DVD on pilates, I would get it.",1219276800,,709,4.358778625954199
3338155,3,B0013D8M3A,"The good bit: I found that the DVD was well structured with 10 min sequences that provide a good workout at an intermediate to advanced level.
The not so good bit: I personally found the music and atmosphere of the DVD rather hectic, that is to say not relaxing, and rather lacking the elegance and harmony of what Pilates, in my opinion, is all about.
I would not recommend this video for beginners as it is rather lacking in cues for breathing, and seems to assume a prior knowledge of the techniques of employing one's core strength.",1215302400,28,536,4.536082474226804

3338157,5,B0013D8M3A,"I have practically all of the 10 minute dvds, and the vast majority are great and this is one of them.  It's cued very well by Lara and it's in the usual format of four workouts and a great 10 minute stretch segment.
Obviously, each segment makes use of a stability ball and that enhances the effectiveness of the workouts.  It's great for your core and they use it in here to help increase your range of motion and it adds a balance element.  My favourite workout here is the abs section and like all the other workouts they do, you can program the workout to be done in any order or do only one or two or three etc workouts in one hit.  It really is a no excuse workout because anyone can find the minimum of 10 minutes, and before you know it, you might even increase it to the maximum 50 minutes and while you're doing this, you're having fun.  Lara is a great instructor and motivating too.
I highly recommend this to practically everyone.  It's mainly intermediate to advanced, but doing shorter sections, beginners can gain a lot here too.  It's great for a total body workout and it's fun.  I enjoy it and hope you will too.",1209168000,50,1132,4.306603773584905
3338158,5,B0013D8M3A,"I began working out 4 years ago when I tried the 10 Minute Solutions Pilates DVDs and have been hooked on the series ever since.  I have tried other pilates (and other workouts) DVDs, but few have been as fun, enjoyable or effective as those in the 10 Minute Solutions series and this new one is no different.  I love the idea of using the ball in pilates, as it presents more challenging ways to get more out of the classic moves and it provides more innovative moves that are not as common.  I really love all sections of this DVD.  They are as follows:

Pilates for Abs-This section focuses of course on the abs, but the ball intensifies the movements.  The other thing I enjoyed was that while I was familiar with many of the moves, there were some that were new or that put a new spin on the classic moves.

Lower Body Pilates-One of the areas of the body that I find especially hard to work is the inner thighs.  This workout enables me to focus on them as well as the rest of my lower body.

Upper Body Pilates-I was expecting to use weights with this section, as with the other 10 Minute Solutions Fitness Ball workout, but was surprised when they were not going to be utilized.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to work my upper body effectively or efficiently without weights, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This workout is a departure from many upper body workouts that I have done and really enjoyed it.

Pilates for Flexibility- This section I used at the end of my workout.  It was very relaxing and I could feel the muscles stretch after a very challenging 40 minute workout.  I can see me just popping this on after a hard day at the office.  It is relaxing, but stretches and relaxes all of your muscles very well.

Total Body Pilates-It's just that, a great mixture of exercises to tone and work the entire body.  I really thought there was a nice variety of moves to work every area very well.

Overall, I completely recommend this workout. I consider myself at an intermediate/advanced level and I found this to be very challenging.  Some of the exercises that are more difficult I will have to work up to, so I can continue to advance with this DVD.  I also love the instructor.  She was pleasant without being obnoxious.  Her cuing and instruction was impeccable.  This will be in regular rotation in my workout schedule.  I can't wait to see what other gems will be released in this series.",1207958400,86,2415,4.424036281179139

I love the 10 minute video series! This DVD is wonderful because it incorporates a stability ball into the pilates moves. It makes them tougher and also gives you a better stretch. I don't have any other pilates props, so using a ball is great to enhance my exercises. FYI: the DVD did not come with a ball, so make sure you have one of your own.

There are definitely some valuable moves in here, and it could be good for someone who really can't fit a full workout in. However, I didn't even work up a sweat. I've only used the DVD once because I figured that if I couldn't even feel it, there was no point in doing it. I do work out about 3 times a week, so it is likely that I'm beyond this level of exercise. I'd recommend it for those just starting to get back into exercise and need to build up endurance.

I love that it is 10 min for each exercise section- lower body, upper body, total pilates, abs, and flexibility. The fact that each lasts 10 min means that you are working so hard but that you know it will come to an end soon and not to give up.

I'm of the view that pilates should be a bit less speedy and this is the sort of program that seems to prefer to take a more quiet form of excercise and see how jazz it can slap into it.  So if you're stubborn about having a quiet, peaceful, and slow pilates program, it might be wise to try another DVD.  But if you were thinking a 10-Minute Solution is all about cramming in the exercise and are okay with that, this should be quite pleasing.

The program is separated into 5 ten-minute worksouts, each with a specific objective.  All of them are fun and effective, though I recommend this DVD to those with some prior Pilates training as the workout does move fast.  The programs are so easy to mix and match and, of course, they are all nice and short so even if you have time for one, you're good.  The advice and training is practical and easy-to-understand, and the moves are clearly demonstrated.

3338353,4,B0013D8M3A,"Here is what I love about workouts like this, you can choose your own workout-I can do 10 minutes if I just have a small break in my day, combine a few of the workouts or do the whole thing for a killer 50 minute workout.  These types of workouts are so good for making ""I can't find time"" an excuse of the past.  I found this dvd to be challenging with the ball (I do pilates dvds but pilates/ball is a whole different thing...).  The ball adds in the extra challenge of keeping steady while you are doing very controlled moves that target abs, upper and lower body or that work on your flexibility.  I am pretty decent at regular pilates, but I was an ""I Love Lucy"" episode on some of these moves, with shaky, bad shopping cart wheel types of movements rolling the ball in and out while my rear end was off the ground and I actually lost a grip a time or two when the ball was over my head, for a hilarious face bounce....hello, could we be an more uncoordinated at this?  Throughout though you are really toning your abs, and you do get better as you move through the exercises.  Do not let the 10 minute solution title make you think this is an easy work-out though.  You are challenged and I would consider this to be a intermediate to somewhat advanced workout for some of the moves. I would say this dvd is not for a beginner to pilates or the ball workouts.  If you are open to trying and failing a little I would give it a go.  I exercise daily but would say the ball workouts are sometimes a challenge if I haven't done them in a while, but they are oh so effective at toning.

Overall, a good workout to help you build your core and work on balance.  Nothing tones the tummy more than Pilates and with the ball you are giving your workout a bit of a boost.

The instructor is extremely clear throughout the entire video, making sure you know exactly how to get into position and when to breathe.  She moves quickly to make the most of the short segments, but spends enough time on each position that you definitely feel it.  The strength required to do these exercises correctly (staying strong, keeping the ball controlled) may preclude beginners from enjoying this.  However, beginners can certainly understand and follow along, as no prior pilates or exercise knowledge is required.  I have worked out consistently, but never done pilates before.  When I purchased it, I thought ten minutes did not seem long enough for each section, but when I'm doing them, it seems too long.

The only section that doesn't benefit from the 10-minute format is the stretching section; there are a lot of stretches in the segment, and to get to them all, she moves fairly quickly, more quickly than I like to go when I'm stretching.  However, I simply pause the DVD whenever I want and extend the stretch time to my liking.

If you're interested in challenging yourself, using that exercise ball you bought and is in the closet, getting toned and flexible, and especially if you are busy and need to work out creatively, purchase this.",1308009600,10,1400,4.969957081545064
3338357,4,B0013D8M3A,"There are 5 work outs in this video that you can play separately like chapters: abs, lower, upper, full, and flexibility.

About the difficulty level: I'm in reasonable shape. I've go on and off of light morning exercise routines, and I tend to be generally active (biking to work, morning walks, yoga classes ect.) but I'm not a fitness buff. I've done a little bit of pilates before. I just did 4 out of the 5 workouts (I didn't do upper body). I found all of the exercises except one (were you go up into a shoulder stand with the ball between your legs, using only your abs no arms) doable. The one I couldn't do I adjusted. I thought the level was pretty reasonable for someone who is in decent shape (not too difficult or too easy). I don't think this is an intermediate level video.

I liked the breath guide, but it could have been louder. Sometimes I wasn't sure how I was supposed to breath. The music was really quiet, and the tone was pretty low key. The pace is good. I found the breathing, and the reps matched well when I figured out what she was doing.

The timing in the flexibility was too fast. The stretches were done at a similar rate to the exercise reps. I don't think this is very effective. I had to do them at my own pace. However the choices of stretches was good.

Overall a good workout. I prefer a more up beat instructor.

Does anyone know of a similar video I could get with a really up beat peppy (even cheerleaderish) instructor? I had a video like this that I lost (but really liked). It seems like this isn't as popular these days. Maybe there is a used dvd from the 80s or 90s that someone could recommend.

3338378,5,B0013D8M3A,"A great twist on pilates exercises. I've done this DVD from start to finish a few times already and it's so much fun! As with the other Lara Hudson's pilates DVDs, time flies and before you know it the workout is over.

The butt/thigh segment is good. The stretching segment at the end is quite decent - probably the best I've seen so far in the 10 Minute Solutions series. I particularly liked using the ball for hip stretches - I now use always use it as a prop for that particular stretch.

I would warn beginners off this DVD though: get a few months of regular pilates/yoga under your belt before attempting this workout. It would be quite easy to hurt yourself in some of the balance exercises, or just trying to keep up with Lara. If you are a beginner and do insist on trying this DVD, make sure you do all the exercises at your own pace and not that of the instructor - it's better to do two repetitions correctly than rush through several and pull a muscle in the process.",1300752000,5,982,4.302702702702702
3338379,5,B0013D8M3A,"I sit one a balance ball at work - this has been great to use over my lunch hour.  At least it's SOMETHING to get me moving.

3338380,4,B0013D8M3A,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

First off, people probably either like working with the ball or they don't.  It can be hard to control at first and you have to get used to it.  For some people, this is worth the effort since you have to use a lot of control over your own muscles to control the ball, for others, it is too frustrating and not worth the potential learning curve.  So those who scored the workout badly because they did not like working with the ball did not give this workout a fair assessment.

That said, I thought this was one of the better ball workouts I've tried.  A lot of pilates moves seem to work well with the ball.  The weakest segment was the ab segment --- while I understand using pilates moves for a pilates workout, one of the best things about the ball is the regular situp action you can get with it and these moves paled in comparison.  The strongest and most surprising segment was the upper body workout using your body weight and the ball.  I find most pilates workouts are rather weak in this area and the ball definitely improved this aspect.

Lastly, I like this instructor and have tried other 10 minute pilates workouts by her.  I find her instructions are clear and well-cued.",1300147200,5,1245,4.440528634361233

3338411,5,B0013D8M3A,"I started incorporating the stability ball in all my workouts about 4 years ago, and pilates about 6 years now.  When I found workouts that combined the 2 I was amazed at the results!  Nothing can compare to the results you'll get in your core.  My abs have never been so defined, and in a much shorter time than the traditional crunches.  Plus these exercises really help with stability and coordination in your everyday life!

I started using the 10 Minute Solution workouts about a year ago, and i'm hooked!  There is so much flexibility in your workouts.  You can customize it to your time limits or the areas you want to concentrate on that day.  This Pilates on the Ball DVD is my favorite 10 Minute Solution by far.  This workout is great because you don't need any other equipment such as hand weights.  I've even purchased an extra stability ball that I keep at work so that I can do this workout on my lunch break.  It's great for short time frames like that.  You can also do 1 of the workouts in the morning and another later in the day to get a full workout in any short amount of time you have in a hectic schedule like mine.

I would say this is a beginner/intermediate type workout, however if you've never done any type of pilates workouts before i'd recommend getting an instructional video that really breaks down how to execute pilates moves properly.  Without the fundamentals you won't get as much out of this or any pilates workout.  There are several DVDs that really teach you the basics.  I used the Windsor pilates beginner instructional video to learn the basics.  I'm so glad I have that information, otherwise i'd only get half the results that I do now.

Usually I alternate this workout with the 10 Minute Solution:  Fitness Ball Workouts DVD to keep my body from getting the plateau effect.  But this workout is my favorite of the 2.  If you want good definiton in your body, especially your abs, I would highly recommend this workout!",1270339200,2,1968,4.534090909090909

3338413,5,B0013D8M3A,"I ordered this video online after redaing some of the reviews and was a beginner but I figured I'd gve it a shot!

The first segment I did was the 10 mintue Abs workout and let me tell you, my abs were quivering and shaking from minute one!  After the 10 minutes of wailing on my abs I just wanted to lay on the floor and strech!  The next day, my stomach was SORE and I don't know about anyone else's body but it takes a lot for my abs to really feel a workout but I felt this one!

I was too sore the next day to try the abs again so I thought I would do the upper body/lower body segment.  Much to my delight (yea right), by using the ball you are engaging your core muscles during almost every exercise.  I fell over a few times while in plank on the ball and my abs were very sore but I did the lower and upper segement and then by day 3 my whole body was sore, haha!

Getting my body into a routine of using this 3-4 times a week has been very beneficial though.  Your body becomes much stronger very quickly and after the soreness fades, you're left with tightening muscles, better posture, balance and - for me - no more lower back pain.

I used to wake up so stiff in the morning, but using the ball and the core engagement you get from pilates, I'm able to support myself better and I wake up feeling great.

I'd recommend this to anyone, even if you're a beginner.  You won't have perfect form when you stanr and it's hard, but you're at home so who cares who sees you looking goofy at fisrt.  You'll see results fast!",1264464000,3,1529,4.043189368770764

I have reached for this DVD many times when I want to do some core work.

Her soothing voice will prompt you from one exercise to another.  If at first you don't succeed, practice some more and you'll get it.  I always thought doing exercise on the ball was a lazy person's way of doing things.  Not so.  It is very difficult to balance one's body on the ball.  It challenges you to hold still (and thus firming up your abs) without having the ball moving away from you.  Definitely not easy but very, VERY, effective!

3338428,4,B0013D8M3A,"This is my first ""10 Minute Solution"" DVD and I am impressed.  I was skeptical but it's well put-together and you do get a good workout in 10 minutes, or a more thorough workout if you combine the segments.

THE GOOD:
The strength here is Lara, the instructor.  As a physical therapist I really appreciate that her form is stellar, and her cueing is spot on.  She may not be the most charismatic person but she knows what she's doing.

The other strength is the format: 10 minutes is easy to find in your day, and it goes so fast that I almost always wind up doing two or three 10-minute segments.  There are four toning segments: Abs, Upper Body, Lower Body, Total Body - and one Flexibility segment.  You can combine them in any way you choose, although of course you want to do the stretching at the end.  The flexibility here, as well as the ease of fitting the workout into your day, make this a workout DVD that stays in my rotation.

THE COULD-BE-BETTER:
This is not a workout for beginners.  I know they don't say that it is... but they don't say it isn't either, and I think that beginners may be attracted to the ""10 Minutes"".  The workout intensity level is intermediate, but some of the moves are fairly advanced and difficult to perform correctly.  This is not for anyone new to exercise.  I think this should be stated on the box and also in the short intro clip.

There is no warm-up or closing stretch.  Obviously, there's no time for them, I don't have a problem with that.  But again, the intro clip should explain not to start a workout cold, and to do either the 'flexibility' segment or your own stretches afterward.

A little bit boring - Lara is very monotone.

BOTTOM LINE:
A good workout that's extremely well cued, and extremely customizable according to your schedule and fitness level.  2 or 3 segments together will give an intermediate exerciser a tough workout, 4 or 5 segments together provide an advanced workout.  Caution: Make sure you stretch afterward, and this is too advanced for the truly new beginner.",1247011200,10,2042,4.542465753424658
