2010914,1,B0001L3MJO,"Perilous fight is a thinly veiled re-edited version of World War II.  Having read dozens and dozens of books on World War II and viewed numerous histories, as well as having visited historical sights related to WWII, both in Asia and Europe, the information here was so politically biased as to be ludicrous in its anti-war stance.  It is no surprise then that the well known actor and anti-war activist Martin Sheen is its narrator.  Insulting to the intelligence of the average person.  Reading or viewing personal narratives of American soldiers and American prisoners of war in the Pacific arena would be far more enlightening as to what the U.S. was truly fighting for, not this poor re-write of history that is blatantly anti-American, Anti-war and Anti-truth.  One of the least accurate ""histories"" I have come across.  The only saving grace of this DVD is the color footage from the time period. Not recommended.",1148601600,8,920,4.941558441558442

8013916,5,B0001L3MJO,"This four-part documentary series for PBS presents a stunning account of Americas monumental contribution to the winning of World War 2.

Astoundingly vibrant and powerful archival film footage was retrieved from all over the world, and combined with first-hand accounts of the experiences of the soldiers, their families, and politicians. ""The Perilous Fight"" is a fantastic record of a global war, as well as of the role in it that is played by racism.

Narration was by Martin Sheen, and the series producer was Martin Smith, whose credits include the Emmy Award-winning PBS series ""Vietnam: A Television History,"" and the Turner/CNN series ""Cold War.""

While the images play, various actors read from the diaries and letters of soldiers. I read excerpts from two soldiers letters and diary accounts. Performing their words proved to be very emotional for me. Perhaps you will have the same experience, hearing the thoughts and feelings of these soldiers.

8013917,5,B0001L3MJO,"It includes a chapter on the Pacific War known by those who fought it THE FORGOTTEN WAR.

More and more the greatest generation leaves to join their comrades in Glory and the generations left forget and are not taught anything about WWII.

It is a great learning tool for those who never had a chance to sit down to dinner with a WWII Hero.

My father survived the Japanese Attack on 12/7/1941. He fought through the Pacific with WORLD WAR I EQUIPMENT AND WORLD WAR ONE POWERED EGGS FOR FOOD. Find a living Hero of the WWII and interview them on tape, hear their stories as we did our father.

We now have his story on a CD in his own words and written on our hearts.

You have to see this DVD to get a small idea of how many died for you and I and all who live in freedom.",1380931200,,773,4.059210526315789
8013918,3,B0001L3MJO,"Was definitely hoping for more out of this film based on the other reviews I read of it. I bought this for the US history class I teach, and only ended up using it once. This will probably be staying on the shelf in the future.",1368576000,,227,3.9565217391304346
8013919,5,B0001L3MJO,"PBS has done an excellent DVD in color of the home front and the war front in my opinion.
I bought this from the used-new category and I am trying to buy another to give as a gift
to a WW II buff.  As a retired history teacher I highly reccommend this.  I wish I had
this dvd to show my students when I was teaching WW II.  You will not be sorry if you purchase
 this dvd.",1344643200,3,372,3.730769230769231
8013920,2,B0001L3MJO,"This was not what I had expected. The content is concentrated on social issues rather than events of the war or strategies. While the footage and letters used are obviously valid and interesting glimpses of the times, it appears that the selection of material and editing was done with respect to a modern progressive mindset.

There were a lot of gruesome deaths in the war and many minorities were treated unfairly. If these are the aspects of the war that you wish to learn about, then this is the documentary for you. Otherwise, you *will* find some interesting information with regard to the war itself, but you will have to endure the former to get to it.",1183334400,3,661,4.64957264957265
8013921,5,B0001L3MJO,"I usually don't respond to reviews (negative or positive) but some of the perspectives offered on THE PERILIOUS FIGHT really trouble me.  I teach Advanced Placement U.S. History at a Southern California high school and I can tell you that I see virtually NO inaccuracies in this program.  Some may indicate it's anti-American (and I'm not sure what that means)or that it glosses over certain elements of WWII. The film isn't revisionist, and ""anti-war"" activist Martin Sheen does a fine job of narration (if you're not anti ANY-war, something's wrong).  Of course, these are only my viewpoints but if someone says a documentary or book is historically inaccurate, please make sure you can cite facts.  I think many of these reviewers are like a fellow I once met who said he would be a great history teacher because he loves to watch the History Channel and is ""really into"" WWII.  THE PERILOUS FIGHT is somewhat of a rarity--a literate interpretation of the war, much like two of the better books on the conflict:  WARTIME (Paul Fussell) and CHOICES UNDER FIRE (Michael Bess).  I encourage viewing of this program as it's compelling, multi-dimensional and non-biased.",1171584000,10,1168,4.989690721649485
8013922,5,B0001L3MJO,"I didn't see this movie being anit-war or anti wwII at all. It wasn't until I saw other reviews that I even considered it. But really, its not.  It talks about other things that were going on during the war, like civil rights and the wars effect on the American people. And It shows what America did before we entered the war. How Rosavelt ammeded laws so he could send arms to Britian and France. If you want to learn about death camps and hear extensive battle tatics then buy another movie. WWII was one of the most popular wars in our History, and I would say little if any of us Americans now do not believe that Hitler had to be stopped, the death camps had to be stopped. But that doesn't mean that war is pretty,or something to be seen through the rose collored glasses of glory. It costly and gruesom. It shows the triumph and defeat of both the American military and the American people. Our Patriotism and Our Internment Camps. Their worry and their pain. I think this was a beautiful movie. It covers things that most movies don't bother mentioning.",1169078400,,1061,4.441025641025641
8013923,3,B0001L3MJO,"Reading the other reviews on this piece, I was startled to see people criticizing each other so harshly. I should think everyone would be aware by now that just about all history is currently taught or presented through the ""politically correct"" lens of our culture (for example, the holiday is called Thanksgiving not because the deeply religious Pilgrims were thanking the Native Americans only, but because they were grateful to God first and foremost--but since that bit of important information brings God into the classroom, it is often eliminated or changed).

So yes, there were points of emphasis in this series that seemed a bit forced in their inclusion, but for all that, it was, over all, deeply moving, and, as far as I could tell, mostly accurate. Part of the negative reaction may be because of Mr. Sheen's being the narrator; he does a wonderful job, but if it had been, say, Charlton Heston, the reviews might have been slightly less negative.

All of which goes to say that, the less viewers know about an actor or actress' political views, the more likely they are to enjoy the presentation; and an alert and creative teacher in a more conservative private school could still use this series for teaching not only about WW II, but also how the current academia interprets it. After all, how history is viewed is part of history itself.",1162857600,5,1355,4.8111587982832615
