5572109,4,B00BC0JIW8,This is a strange tale set in the back drop of the black death in a small Welsh village who's inhabitants try to find a cure by tunneling into the earth only to come out in modern day New zealand to complete their misson. The film starts in black and white and goes to colour when they reach modern times before reverting back again. Well acted and shows the difference between the two cultures with a strange clarity. Well worth a watch,1387843200,,437,4.341463414634147
5572110,3,B00BC0JIW8,"This movie begins in the 14th century England. The problem with this movie is the shooting of this movie.  It is very dark, no literally, the movie is filmed in a dark black in white, and transition to some what dark, kind of color.  This is the distraction of the fantasy odyssey. If you can follow this, than it is not such a bad fantasy movie. It's not your DVD or your Blue Ray or your player, it the way the film was filmed!",1378425600,3,429,4.095238095238095
5572111,5,B00BC0JIW8,"I first saw this movie sometime in the 1990's. I stumbled across it in a video store and the outline seemed weird but interesting. No one I know had heard of it or seen it. I put it into the vcr, turned it on, and for the runtime of the movie was utterly captivated.

This is a drama with comedic elements, religious sentiment, awe, wonder, terror. The cinematography is stunning, the focus is on humanity - ancient and modern. How we're not so different even with our technology. Etc.
But bottom line, what this movie is - is utterly unforgettable. It's haunted me ever since I saw it. For a great many years I forgot the name of it, but the faces and story never left me. Then the internet came along and I found it again.

See this movie. You must see this movie - quite possibly one of the finest science fiction/fantasy movies ever made.",1374883200,38,842,4.356687898089172
5572112,5,B00BC0JIW8,"I saw this movie when it was released in 1988 and it described exactly everyone's mood about AIDS at that time : a new and unknown plague, killing young people and transforming the lively and colourfull seventies into a dark and scary time with no hope.
AIDS, at that time, meant death, as sure as plague did.
I've just ordered it again to make my children understand how everybody felt horribly powerless and terrified and lost in front of this epidemy.
The Navigator remains emblematic of this time and of AIDS. To be seen.",1369612800,2,525,4.595744680851064
5572113,5,B00BC0JIW8,"You have never heard of this film.

It was so ""successful"" that the kid who stars in it went on to a career BEHIND THE SCENES

It is a sci-fi film with no sci

It is tragic and funny and weird

You will laugh

You will cry

You will NEVER forget it

It is about time travel

It is about plague

It is about life

You have never seen anything like it

You will love it

Just watch",1368057600,28,379,3.717948717948718
5572114,5,B00BC0JIW8,This was a surprisingly thought provoking film.  It is both science fiction (time travel) and a adventure movie that sees good and bad people in both ages it portrays.  The main protagonist really believes he is crossing the earths core and going to the other side of what they think is a flat world and makes his companions believe that as well although in the end you wonder if anyone else went or was it just a vision quest.  The ending is a little surprising and like all movies that end like that is sad.  I liked it and think others might like it as well.,1449187200,,561,4.264150943396227

5572118,5,B00BC0JIW8,"This is a black and white movie produced by the New Zealand Film Commission in the 1980s.  The real value of this movie appears to be a sci-Fi/Adventure that centers on the viewpoint of a young boy.  The young boy is portrayed with a mystic vision of a remote cave that may contain the answer to escape the 14th Century Black Plague in England.  The focus on the impact of death, disease, and the losses in the community as experienced by young boy give meaning to universal problems in mortal existence that burden any century whether the Dark Ages or Modern Times.
The viewer of this film will absorb the real value by the center of attention on how everything affects the young boy in particular and the interaction of the adults in general in struggles to survive.  For family viewing, there are some very important lessons about life and the value of any person.",1431475200,7,867,4.574193548387097
5572119,5,B00BC0JIW8,"O.K. I saw this movie, back in the 90's when it came out, and it is so unique, you won't soon forget it.  There are funny parts, parts that make you say ""what?""!  Suspenseful parts, etc.  There is a lot of black and white, but much of it is taking place in the middle ages.  I liked it, I made my teenage kids watch it, they didn't like it as much. But, it's a good story.  I like the whole time travel theme. I have tried all the Blockbuster movie rentals in our state and the library and was unable to locate this movie anywhere, to re-watch it, so I'm glad it own it now.

5572124,3,B00BC0JIW8,"Confusing to an American
Dr. Ali Fant, WB5WAF

This film was recommended by an Amazon search robot based upon my previous purchase of the 1960 Time Machine movie with Rod Taylor.

The quality of the film is excellent, but I had to put on the subtitles in order to understand the heavily accented North England brogue English.

The film begins in 1350s in Northwest England when the Bubonic Plague (Black Death) approaches Cumbria. The local miners believe the plague moves during each full Moon. The miners purpose to take a load of copper ore to the Big City where the largest cathedral in Christendom is being built to ward off the plagues advancement across Europe.

Following a boys dreams, the miners dig a tunnel to the far side of the Earth in order to reach the Big City before Moon rise. During the dig, the explorers breach a tesseract into a 1988 sewage system of the Big City.

During the course of the night, the miners find a modern foundry to cast their copper ore gift into a steeple cross for the cathedral. The boy climbs the spire to place the copper cross at the summit to halt the plague in their time.

Filmed in B&W and Color entirely on location in New Zealand.",1414886400,,1185,4.514018691588785

5572126,2,B00BC0JIW8,"this was a very interesting movie. The medievals were in black and white until they reach the modern world, and showed the way they reacted to the ""wonders"" and confusion  you might expect.",1407110400,,189,4.7272727272727275
5572127,1,B00BC0JIW8,"I have to admit that I have no idea what this movie was supposed to be all about.  Something about people from the 14th century tunneling their way through the Earth, to arrive in 20th century New Zealand, so they can put a cross on top of a church.  Then it all turned out to be a dream, or maybe not.  What?  Maybe I'm just dense, but I didn't understand even half of what was going on.  I'm afraid I don't recommend this at all, and would not watch it again.",1406937600,,461,4.021978021978022
5572128,5,B00BC0JIW8,"I first saw The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey back in 1988 during its theatrical run in Australia where it won six AFI awards including Best Film. This was an Australian/New Zealand co-production filmed in New Zealand and directed by the visionary Vincent Ward. It is a film quite unlike any other and yet made with such assurance and mastery. The story is set in a small northern English medieval town and revolves around a young boy named Griffin who has a series of visions that the villagers believe are messages from God. The bubonic plague is spreading from London and killing millions in its wake. As death moves closer and closer to the small village, Griffin's visions become more surreal and desperate. For the village to be saved from the plague, someone must make the ultimate sacrifice. To say anymore is to introduce some amazing spoilers and it's best if you go into this film knowing as little as possible about it.

Vincent Ward is the visionary New Zealand director behind The Navigator and unfortunately he has too few films to his name. In many ways, Ward is a lot like another visionary director, Terry Gilliam. Both directors come up with extraordinary concepts for the screen and despite being hired for their amazing talent, all too often they are hamstrung by nervous producers and studioheads who wish they'd hired a less inventive, creative and uncompromising talent. Ward was hired for the 1998 Robin Williams film about the afterlife called What Dreams May Come, which despite some incredible scenes, suffered from constant studio interference. He also directed the wonderful 1992 film, Map of the Human Heart, which likewise wears the grimace of lurking producers. Most famously, Ward was hired to write and director Alien3, which promised to take the story in an entirely unique and terrifying direction that would have been more gothic than gothic. However, Ward was fired and newcomer David Fincher was hired to pick up the pieces. Fortunately newcomer Fincher had the good sense to retain some of Ward's ideas and these are still the strongest aspects of that film, despite being in a watered-down version. I mention all this because The Navigator is one of the few Vincent Ward films made without American studio interference and the proof is in its incredible vision, uncompromisingly original story, and incredible production values that continue to stand the test of time.

I cannot recommend this film enough. For those people who are looking for something out of the ordinary, I recommend this film and they always come back raving about it.",1402358400,7,2581,4.986078886310905
5572129,5,B00BC0JIW8,"This movie fascinated me from the start when I first saw it in 1988. I even bought a crappy copy on VHS (remember that?). Imagine my thrill when I saw it could be acquired in this modern disc format! This movie is quirky and mesmerizing. Give this movie a chance to thrill you, too.",1399334400,5,282,4.2407407407407405
5572130,4,B00BC0JIW8,"Very dark and interesting film and not at all what I was expecting which is to say much lighter fare. The story involves a group seeking escape or divine intervention from the black plague. The motley medieval  crew somehow crosses over into a dark rainy bleak industrial modern world and struggles to put a spire on a church that the youthful ""navigator"" Griffin has seen in a vision. They encounter a variety of challenges from crossing a motorway to dealing with a submarine (Still trying to figure out the symbolism of that)The how or why of the this time travel is never fully explained. Notwithstanding the color photo on the DVD cover, the film is shot in a very dark and grainy black and white. The DVD is best viewed in a darkened room.

All in all an interesting film",1396828800,5,777,4.542857142857143

5572133,5,B00BC0JIW8,This is not a glitzy done movie.  But I watched it ten years ago and really wanted to see it again.  You certainly need to suspend your natural belief of movies. It definitely paints a grim picture of the black plague years.  I doubt it is very historically accurate but it is a semi-fantasy of you will.  The acting of the young boy is very good and i find some of it to be pretty dramatic.,1390176000,,391,4.105263157894737
