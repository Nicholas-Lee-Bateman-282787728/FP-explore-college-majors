An Amazon reviewer by the name of Welton left a review about this DVD collection on February 27, 2012. The review states: ""The films are highly recommendable, but the quality of the dvds is poor."" I have viewed all six of the movies in this two disc set. That is a lot of information crammed onto each disc and frankly, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality, particularly after reading Welton's review. However, I made the purchase regardless, and was delightfully surprise. The quality was quite nice, and far exceeded my expectations. I gave particular attention to the film, The Sons of Mistletoe, since Welton stated that it ""was actually so bad that it made our eyes hurt while we watched it."" I must admit that The Sons of Mistletoe has a soft focus as oppose to all the other films which process a sharp focus. But a soft focus is not out of focus. I found it more than acceptable and it ""didn't hurt my eyes."" Welton must be a ""tougher grader"" than I am, or I must be easily pleased. So, in matters of quality, I guess only you can be the judge.",1336953600,14,2453,4.426666666666667
8474063,3,B005I0DUPO,"We bought this dvd bonus pack as we like many of the films that are represented. The films are highly recommendable, but the quality of the dvds is poor. One of the films (Mistletoe) was actually so bad that it made our eyes hurt while we watched it. we would therefore not buy a 6 film product like this again.",1330300800,3,311,4.2
