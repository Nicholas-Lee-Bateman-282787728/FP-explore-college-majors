8455619,5,B0053SOD7A,"I'm a big wine fan and had caught bits of this movie on PBS a couple years ago. After some intense Googling, I found this movie and convinced my fiance (who hates most docs) to watch it with me. He loved it, as did I! It was incredibly well shot and gets into the winemaking process. I really liked how it explained what makes growing wine in VA different than, say, CA. However, this is a travel video and at times that shows. Watch it with a good bottle of VA cabernet franc like we did if you're into the technical side of winemaking.",1381622400,,537,4.173076923076923
