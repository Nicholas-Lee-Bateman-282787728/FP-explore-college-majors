327971,3,6301440056,"A pedestrian plot, with some really really hard attempts at humor. Bellushi is alright, but almost everyone else smacks of a second rate B movie. The movie does have some neat moments though, especially where the dog is involved. I cooked while I ""watched"" it, perhaps that's a good way to ""enjoy"" this blooper.",1078272000,4,311,4.777777777777778
327972,5,6301440056,"I love this movie, Jim Belushi is a great actor, the dog is great too.
All three of the K-9 movies are great, so if you own one of them, then you should own all three.",1068595200,5,167,3.6666666666666665
327973,5,6301440056,"This was the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time.  We were screaming in hysteria throughout the whole movie.  I thought my 6yr old was going to pass out from lack of air due to not being able to catch his breath from laughing so hard.  Belushi and Jerry Lee were great together.  This movie was even funnier than ""See Spot Run""  and that was a very funny movie too.",1030233600,3,377,4.109589041095891
327974,5,6301440056,"I might be a bit biassed in writing this but my shepherd named Shepherd of Bourne is a carbon copy of Jerry Lee.  The dogs personality definetly shines through with his own little grunts and whines mixed with body language as close to human without looking fake or acted out.  The story line is well written with Jerry Lee a headstrong K-9 dog who is well trained, but has his own way of doing things.  This goes with the Police officer's character as well.  I saw this movie when I was young, loved it, and have continued to love it as I have grown up over the years.  I recently purchassed the DVD of K-911 and loved it equally, but nothing compares with the original.  It's just now that I am finding K-9 on DVD and amazon.com is the only place that carries it.  All other stores in my local area of Cape Cod do not carry this movie.  911 on the other hand is somewhat accessible. If you do choose to purchase this film I would recommend it for the age ranges of children from 8 and up. Some scenes involving some light violence and a suggested scene of the sexual nature of animals may bring up some questions to the parents.",984528000,7,1129,4.267605633802817
327975,5,6301440056,"Although ostensibly a very funny comedy about an undisciplined detective (Jim Belushi) trying to catch a drug dealer, K-9 is really about the gradual development of a strong relationship between two mavericks -- the detective and the equally-undisciplined drug-sniffing dog he borrows from the K-9 department. Jim Belushi and Jerry Lee (a beautiful, highly-intelligent German Shepherd who is better than most actors) are both superb and this is an incredibly funny -- but also quite touching -- film. I love it. This movie is, quite simply, a classic.",980812800,2,551,5.2727272727272725

328757,1,6301440056,"Yes, policeman with police dog partners are not a rarity in movie entertainment, but this movie stands out. Unfortunately by that I don't mean in a good way.

The policeman played by Belushi is an utterly nasty and unlikable character. While he may have been involuntarily partnered with the dog, it hardly justifies his abusive behavior towards him. There is nary a laugh in the whole movie, and the dog clearly moves faster than a real dog possibly could.

The movie poster ironically shows the dog with its paw on Belushi's shoulder, giving the impression that the movie was going to be much nicer than it was. It should have shown the dog tearing out Belushi's throat.",1438732800,,672,4.735042735042735

328831,4,6301440056,"Pretty good if maybe a little dated.

These days the behaviour of the cop played by Jim Belushi is less acceptable to me than it once was, and there are a whole bunch of holes in the plot that tend to take away from it a little bit, but it is still pretty good.

Belushi's character is unofficially issued a police dog by a friend in his department to help him in a drug investigation. Their adventures are both funny in spots and action filled, and at the end heart rending.

A young looking Ed O'Neill (Al Bundy) plays a police lt.",1437868800,,533,4.205882352941177

328940,5,6301440056,"Back in the day, Belushi was the man! Taking Care of Business, Mr. Destiny, The Principal, K-9, these were some of his best movies, in my opinion anyway. By the DVD cover, you can kinda guess what kinda movie it's gonna be. Turner and Hooch with Tom Hanks came out around the same time with a similar story and both movies were hits.  Although for some reason, I like this one a little better. Belushi plays a fly by the seat of his pants cop who does not like working with a partner. Until he meets Jerry Lee, a veteran police dog who has seen it all and is even more volatile than his soon to be partner. Belushi is obsessed with trying to catch a drug lord that has eluded him for years. With the help of Jerry Lee, perhaps this time the bad guys will go down. The dynamic of the 2 heroes is perfect and makes a person want to go out and get a German Shepard, or any dog for that matter. Watch this one and Turner and Hooch and judge for yourself which one is better. Kids will love it too, but there is some violence and bad language so parents need to supervise. Also, there is a quick cameo of a younger, Ed O Neill who was ruling TV back then as is still going strong today. Hope this helps. Take it easy.",1429142400,,1212,4.071129707112971

For his sins he is given Jerry Lee who is a canine (K-9 get it) cop.  James has zero experience with dogs.  Both of them get involved with a lot of bang-bang shoot em up action and Jerry Lee eventually trains Belushi.  Several classic scenes which you will remember for quite awhile.

He was skeptical when I told him how funny the movie was and of coarse he had no idea who Jim Belushi is. I think my son was laughing more than I was watching this movie. He loved it. He is also a big fan of German Shepards.

This movie is about a tough guy cop, who takes a dog as his partner to track down some drugs. The guy talks to the dog like he hates him, and the dog acts like he understands everything he is say. Eventually they come to a middle grown and become friends. Even saving each others lives.

Still as good as I remember it to be. Totally worth watching",1404172800,,672,3.9338235294117645

OK.  Now that we have that straight, allow me to say that this movie was fun to watch and identify with, even though neither my husband nor I are in law enforcement nor are any of our relatives. Just having had a German Shepherd was enough to make the movie hilarious.  To be sure, the movie plot of chasing the big-time drug dealer was suspenseful and came to an end where the villian gets his commupance and the story ends in a satisfying way.

But the dog himself along with Detective Dooley's (Belushi) comedy skills kept me laughing through the whole movie.  Especially funny was Jerry Lee (the dog's)  infatuation with Dooley's girlfriend, even trying to protect her from her own boyfriend!  Equally was funny was the romp between Jerry Lee and a stately, beautiful female standard poodle.

I can guarantee you that you'll watch this movie over over and find it equally funny each time -- in fact, you'll find more humor each time you watch it.

329532,5,6301440056,"I have either owned German Shepherds or when I lived with my parents in the 70's we had German Shepherds, so my entire life I have had 8 GSD's who are a fantastic breed. I saw the original movie about a decade ago and fell in love with it. The main reason is my GSD (German Shepherd Dog) King who passed away 3 years ago was exactly like Jerry Lee. From the moaning to almost everything in the movie. I got King from a breeder and while he was not a LE K9 he was trained in detection and protection. When he wasn't training with me he was so much like Jerry Lee I had to have this movie. Kings life achievement was assisting Law Enforcement after Hurricane Katrina in delaying and capturing looters right after the storm. Jerry Lee is everything in this movie that GSD's are in real life. They are dedicated to their masters to death. Out of the three movies the first is the best hands down, my attraction to the other movies in the series just happened to the the GSD's and not Mr. Belushi. Dont get me wrong Mr. Belushi is funny in the movie when his character receives Jerry Lee and starts to learn about the breed and working with them. I would suggest anyone who has a love for dogs, especially K9's and the GSD's purchase the movie. The interaction between actor and canine is wonderful and well worth the price of the movie. A small foot note, the original Jerry Lee was a real Police K9 who after the first movie really gave his life in the line of duty during a drug bust gone wrong.

329633,5,6301440056,"Michael Dooley (James Belushi), a narcotics detective for the San Diego PD, is fixated on bringing down Ken Lyman, a high society drug lord who's preparing for a $50 million cocaine shipment. Knowing he needs a K-9 to make the bust, Dooley ""works outside the rules"" and manages to partner himself with Jerry Lee, an intelligent--but quirky--German shepherd dog. You can imagine the series of amusing scenarios that take place before the two learn to value one another, and when Lyman has Dooley's girlfriend Tracy (Mel Harris) kidnapped, Jerry Lee shows Dooley how far he'd be willing to go to hold up his end of their unbeatable partnership.

Belushi is the right man for the part, and nothing negative could be said of his cute canine co-star! In my opinion, Mel Harris also offers an enjoyable, believable performance as Dooley's girlfriend. The bad guy roles are nothing stellar--neither good nor bad. They serve their purpose, but the real spotlight is on Jerry Lee anyhow--and rightfully so!

K-9 is one of those few movies that truly offer something for everyone--romance, comedy, action, animals, and even a heart-warming moment or two. Admittedly, the script could be more impressive, and the plot is simplistic, but these apparent disappointments keep things light-hearted, let the movie appeal to all ages, and keep the dog enthusiast 100% engaged. The first time I watched this film years ago, I was pleasantly surprised that the producers let the dog's personality shine through without making him fake and cartoony; they didn't computerize any of his expressions or make him do things that are too outlandish. There may be a few technicalities that viewers who are police officers may pick at (such as Dooley's commanding Jerry Lee though the pair didn't train together), and you do have to surrender your practicality every now and then in the name of fun.

SPECIAL FEATURES
These are few and disappointing on this DVD, but it was released in 1999, so that's to be expected. The disc includes production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios (and no, Jerry Lee is not among them), film highlights, the original theatrical trailer, and Universal web links.

RATING
K-9 is rated PG-13. Some possible parental causes for concern: swearing, light violence, some sexual content (nothing graphic), and doggy intercourse (though it's only implied, not shown).

P.S. I wouldn't recommend the other two installments in this trilogy (K-911 and K-9: P.I.). Fans of the original won't appreciate Tracy's absence and Dooley's ""replacement"" love interests, or, possibly, Zeus, the Jerry Lee competitor. They won't like seeing Jerry Lee already out of his prime, slowing in chase scenes and with some gray scruff on his chin. And, most disappointing of all, Jerry Lee doesn't play himself. The significantly lower ratings on Amazon for the successors speak for themselves. Watch K-911 and K-9: P.I. just for kicks, but don't have your hopes up too high.",1249516800,,2948,5.1078838174273855

329695,5,6301440056,"I've watched this film at LEAST five times, yet one scene in this film NEVER fails to move me:James Belushi's Officer Dooley(carrying his gravely wounded police dog after a near fatal shoot-out)frantically runs into a nearby ER room and-through sheer guts and determination-gets immediate medical care for his dying police dog ""Jerry Lee"".  The task is by no means an easy one, as he meets the nursing staff's firm refusal at every turn, culminating in a confrontation with an exasperated ER doc who assures him:""Don't get so excited, It's just a DOG!"" to which Belushi(as Officer Dooley) declares(with STUNNING conviction):""""He's NOT just a DOG!  He's a COP!  And he's not just ANY cop, he's my PARTNER!  He's bleeding to death!  Either you help him NOW or he's gonna DIE!""  After the dazed medical staff wheel off Jerry Lee into surgery, you simply MUST LISTEN to Dooley's truly HEARTRENDING, straight from the gut reverie, spoken to HIMSELF more than his girlfriend Tracy(Mel Harris).

It simply breaks my heart EVERY time I hear it, as it's almost the exact same thing I heard an officer say in an animal ER many years ago! I challenge ANYONE to listen to him and NOT be moved right to the core.  I swear that one scene-even if there was nothing else to recommend the film for-makes this film SO compelling to watch.  A brilliant, sincere and surprising highmark of the film,I think it's easily James Belushi's finest screen moment.

This film unfortunately gets too many comparisons with ""Turner & Hooch""(similar plots and both released the same year).  What sets this film APART is that ""K-9"" asserts-albeit in a lighthearted manner befitting a screwball comedy-what MANY officers over the years have admitted:that your police dog does indeed become MORE than a mere tool to enhance your job performance.  He becomes your PARTNER,deserving your utmost respect and support in ALL situations.

""Jerry Lee"" is utterly adorable and amazing to watch as Belushi's shaggy canine partner.  Watching him in action should silence anyone's argument over whether or not ANIMALS deserve the right to earn Oscar nominations too, tee hee!

Overall, I give it five stars for good, action-packed entertainment AND some meaty food for thought as to what dogs really DO mean to us, in whatever role they play in our lives!

PS Check out a HILARIOUS Ed O'Neill, as wise-cracking Officer Brannigan!",1137542400,18,2383,4.9949367088607595

James Belushi is funny in all of the movies. This set is a must for every dog lover.",1126051200,31,247,3.6792452830188678
329699,5,6301440056,"This is a fantastic bargain. There is one disc here, but you get all 3 K-9 films. The first 2 films on side one. The 3rd film of the trilogy on side 2.
James Belushi is perfectly comfortable in his ad-lib role as the cop with the German Shepheard partner. The timing is right on and the action non-stop. Bravo!",1088294400,81,310,4.183333333333334
