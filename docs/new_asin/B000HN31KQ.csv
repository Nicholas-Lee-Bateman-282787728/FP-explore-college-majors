2737519,4,B000HN31KQ,"It took some time to get through all 21 of these hammer films, but I have watched them all and am ready to give it my review.

First off the box looks good. It's unique, really compact comes with some postcards and a booklet with a photo and few lines for each movie.
I watched them through an upconverting player connected via hdmi to a 30""hd 16:9tv at 1080i.
The films are all enhanced for 16:9 and filled the screen with vibrant rich colors that hammer is known for.
The prints are pretty nice looking, and the transfer to dvd looks just great, one or two of them look a bit dark or muddy in places, reptile was low budget so its most likely the original film.
These dvds are pal format region 2 so you'll need to have a player to match.

As far as the intrinsic quality of each film that's in the eyes of the viewer, but I would have to say that every film here has a little something special whether it be a great acting job, a bit of dark humor or plot twist.

Rather than give films stars, I rate them for viewability. Ratings go from 1 view which means its worth one view only, you most likely will never want or need to see the film again, to multiple view which is the highest rating meaning you can watch the movie over and over again.

'Blood From The Mummies Tomb', 2 views No dusty old mummies hogging up the scenes in this one, Valerie Leon is hot and she plays 2 roles, so..
'Demons Of The Mind', 1-2 view
'The Devil Rides Out', 3+ views classic Lee entertaining, standard race to save the child from the demonic forces, type film.
'Viking Queen', 1-2 views interesting  but not as filling as it could have been.
'Dracula, Prince Of Darkness', 2-3 view
'Fear In The Night', 2-3 views a bit standard along the lines of an EC comics shock suspense or haunt of fear, creepy classic Cushing menacing that poor lovely young girl.
'Frankenstein Created Women', 2-3 view very interesting grafting of a typical revenge tale with a benevolent Frankenstein, classic Cushing.
'The Horror Of Frankenstein', 2-3 view unusual horror comedy again owing to the EC horror comics.
'The Nanny', 3 views, the nanny, who hasn't pranked nanny? or had a sibling that did?
'One Million Years BC', Harryhausen monsters, Raquel Welch, gorgeous babes in skimpy loin cloths 'nuff said... multi view
'The Plague Of The Zombies', 1 view
'Prehistoric Women', I liked this attractive movie. The story was unbelievable with lots of holes, but the cast of dozens of gorgeous babes in skimpy loin cloths filled them well. 2 views
'Quartermass And The Pit', 3-4 view classic, but ultimately leaves you hanging for a sequel
'Rasputin The Mad Monk', 3-4 view Lee is really off the hook here although the film doesn't have too many characters to root for
'The Reptile', 1 view, tried to watch another time but failed. check out<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sssssss/dp/B00023P4V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sssssss</a>for a better low budget reptihuman movie.
'The Scars Of Dracula', 2-3 views
'SHE', 2 views some classic heroic cushing
'To The Devil A Daughter', once should be enough for this depraved film but for Natashia Kinski and Mr Lee it gets 2 views. lee is as evil as it gets in this one.
'The Vengeance Of SHE', fairly weak overall, didn't really grab me with anything. Most interesting character drops out very early on, I could not tell you how it ended.
'Straight On Till Morning' 2 views good serial killer type movie well acted
'The Witches' 2 views a few surprise keep this one fresh.

Finally a couple disc have interviews as special features, and a hammer documentary. Scant but welcome additions to an already high quality product.

Finally this set is worth the big money at $4-5 per dvd, you really cant go worng.",1286755200,46,3752,4.701674277016743

2737525,5,B000HN31KQ,"Disclaimer: I bought my copy of this item from Amazon UK, not Amazon US.
Next disclaimer: I was a bit of a Hammer novice when I purchased this.  I owned a few of the Cushing/Lee Dracula pictures and a few of the Frankenstein pictures and, for the longest time, thought that delving any deeper into the world of Hammer would only yield rather poor returns.  This box set taught me otherwise.  Even if you are one of the many people who think that the Hammer was at its best when producing Dracula and Frankenstein movies, you are still likely to find a lot of fantastic material in this boxed set.
The Devil Rides out, Quatermass and the Pit, Fear in the Night, and She are fantastic examples of Satanic horror, science fiction, Psycho-style thriller, and supernatural costume drama respectively. Additionally, this set contains a number of solid (if not completely fantastic) gothic horror films including a couple of vampire films, a couple of Frankenstein films, the Reptile, the Mad Monk, and Plague of Zombies. There are a few clunkers (e.g. Slave Girls, Vengeance of She, Viking Queen) but the set is still great overall.  Of all the Hammer Films collections or boxed sets available, this is the one that probably is the best deal in terms of value per dollar spent.",1385337600,6,1271,4.737556561085973

2737527,5,B000HN31KQ,"This a box that is well thought out in design.  I love that each dvd has its own recepticle.  I really like the ""book"" design.  The quality of the picture is the best I have seen of the Hammer Studio dvds so far.",1367884800,9,212,3.883720930232558
2737528,5,B000HN31KQ,"This is a must for any Hammer Studio affictionado. A terrific set with rare titles from Hammer Studios. If you buy the titles separately it would costs several times more money.
THE ULTIMATE HAMMER COLLECTION is well worth the price!!!  However you need a REGION FREE DVD PLAYER to view them.",1338768000,6,292,4.7254901960784315
2737529,5,B000HN31KQ,"First of all let's look at the price and the disks.  It comes out to about $4.50 per movie.  A very good price.  But you get so much more than just a movie.  Most of the disks contain outstanding extras like cast interviews, a making of the movie documentary, etc.  It is more than I have ever gotten buying a single Hammer film for more money.  The transfer quality is the best I have ever seen.  These are the original UK releases not the US versions which sometimes were altered.

As to the selection of what movies are included, I have no idea what the criteria was.  It does not include most of their best films.  I don't know if they were choosing what they though were less seen films, less purchased films, etc.  There are several films included that I have never seen and I'm a fairly serious horror collector.  One delight is The Nanny with Betty Davis.

I do have one complain with the set which will not put most off.  I don't hear as well as others and I rely a lot on subtitles and these disks have none.  That seems rather cheap for the cost and if you look at single disks of these films, most do have subtitles.

I would recommend this collection to any collector of horror films.

I missed my big chance several years back.  It was during the time that Hammer went dark and it appeared that Hammer films had come to an end.  There was a small UK Hammer site that offered EVERY movie that Hammer ever made to that point.  At the time I did not know how to play Region 2 movies in the US and it was fairly expensive, so I passed.  The worst buying decision I have ever made.  I would think some would show up used for huge prices but I have never seen it for sale again.

However, there is NO ECUSE for there not being a region 1 release.  Typical British snobery.  They stll belive there is is a British Emire that ones a 5th of the work.  They can sink in to ocean for all I care.  A total contry of snobs.",1332633600,3,1924,4.143631436314363
2737530,5,B000HN31KQ,"This is a wonderful collection of movies, but...

While it does seem to be ""ultimate"" in the sense that it has the largest number of Hammer studios' productions around, it is less than ""complete"" in the strictest sense. It is missing such notable titles as ""The Quatermass Experiment,"" ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" and others (which, fortunately, are available in other collections).

What it does have, however, are some of the finest examples of early screen gore and eerie set operas available anywhere. The 21 disks in this collection provide a remarkable window into a film studio that revolutionized the industry in the 1950s and '60s. I highly recommend it, with the caution that (for the time being) it can only be played on machines capable of playing Region 2 (non-US format) DVDs.",1326844800,15,790,4.932330827067669

8170253,5,B000HN31KQ,"As a big fan of Hammer Horror, I am quite pleased with this collection. Granted it is a region 2 so I put in the first disk in my computer with PowerDVD open and it will ask you to change to region 2 (from region 1 in the US - you have a few times you can change your region on your computer). After changing the region to play these region 2 DVDs, then open a program such as DVD decrypter and copy the disk eliminating the region codes altogether. The result will be a DVD folder with the movie without any region coding. Use any DVD copying program to now make you a region free version of the movie you just copied in and you can watch the movie on any home DVD player. Two of the DVDs are dual-layered so you will also need DVD shrink to shrink the file down to regular DVD size.
