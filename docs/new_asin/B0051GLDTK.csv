4521519,5,B0051GLDTK,"this movie was touching, it tells that even when you think you want something else in life, you realize what you chose was the right decision.  Eric Close has always been a favorite of mine, good to see him in a heartwarming role.",1360972800,,230,4.348837209302325
4521520,4,B0051GLDTK,"My edited review from Eye Em Dee Bee:

I enjoyed this film. Lifetime is hit or miss for me, but this one was a winner. It had good acting, good characters (mostly), and a simple story. I thought the beginning set up the movie very well w/the family sitting around watching the old tape with dad during his football days, mom in her cheer outfit, and the ex who at the time was w/dad. From the beginning, it's clear that something made Dad hold on to the memories of 'Ava,' and Mom is still a tad insecure about it. Well, Ava's back in town to bury her mother, and tensions begin. Not going to get too into the plot. It comes on Lifetime often enough if you're interested in checking it out. I ended up buying the dvd to check to see if there are deleted scenes included. I know some tv movies are actually longer on the dvd.

I feel this movie could have been a little longer. I'd be interested in knowing what got edited. It seemed like there was a lot of build up, but the actual betrayal and breakdown of the family happened in the last 30-40 minutes. I did like the ending though w/Ben at Thanksgiving. I got the impression that things would eventually work out.",1331251200,2,1166,4.271493212669683
4521521,5,B0051GLDTK,This is by far one of my favorite lifetime movies and I'm so glad that it was put on dvd so I could buy it!!!!,1329868800,,110,3.44
4521522,4,B0051GLDTK,I ordered this movie for a family member.  She received it in a timely manner and has had no issues with the dvd itself.,1322956800,,120,4.0
4521523,5,B0051GLDTK,"Someone told me about the song at first. When I heard it, I cried because it was so much like my past. I knew I had to see the movie. It was so good! I took it to work and let my good friend watch it. Excellent Movie!!!!!",1322524800,,221,3.625
4521524,5,B0051GLDTK,"I saw this on TV when the movie was first released there, and knew I wanted it to own it. It was so good about a loving family and the old fling who comes into their lives and how things get out of control by trying to live the past again. How an act can mess up a whole family. But it does end on a good note. Great acting and so true too not only the song, but to real life. Worth watching.

4521525,5,B0051GLDTK,"This movie has a fabulous story. Especially if you have ever wondered about your first love. It is not family oriented by far, But by reading the back of it one should understand that a movie about a relationship is not something you would watch with the family. This movie really makes you think what if?? and maybe the grass isn't always greener on the other side!",1316390400,7,366,4.477611940298507
4521526,3,B0051GLDTK,"I rented this movie from my local video rental store. I chose it because from the box, the movie looks very family oriented, inspirational and a family friendly film; it was none of those things! This movie is categorized as Not Rated and in my opinion, should have been rated PG or PG-13 at the least. It included; innapropriate language, teen sexuality, adult affairs, etc. There were no positive or spiritual story lines whatsoever in the film.
  After reading the outside of the box and watching the film, I kept waiting for the part where spirituality or the focus of family would come in and it never happened. At one point, I checked to make sure that the correct DVD had been in the box!
  I think that most will find the story line to be entertaining, but the description on the box is extremely misleading! Not a family film! I do not have children but if I did, this is a movie that we would turn off in the middle, and not finish.
  Just wanted to warn parents who might rent this thinking it would be a good family film...check elsewhere!",1316217600,12,1051,4.447916666666667

8452627,1,B0051GLDTK,"Nothing like the song. In the song, the guy is glad God didn't answer his prayer to make his high school girlfriend his wife because he was happy with the woman he had chosen. Not the case here.

I picked up this movie because it looked like a faith-based family film, but it isn't. The box says it isn't rated, but it should be.

Teenage sex, drinking, language, and nudity where a married man goes skinny-dipping with his old high school sweetheart who isn't his wife. And the high school sweatheart isn't shy about flirting with the married man.

Though it ends with a lesson in forgivness, it's not for families.",1509321600,,616,4.531531531531532

8452636,5,B0051GLDTK,"This movie was wonderful.  The husband, Eric Close, and wife, Samantha Mathis,  were so real in their presentation.  I am not typically Lifetime channel  movie watcher, but was home sick and this movie came on.  I was hooked. The acting was stellar from these two, as well as the son and Madchen Amuck.  The realness of how these people felt is something that was very relatable to the viewer and they made it raw and real.",1456185600,,423,4.5
