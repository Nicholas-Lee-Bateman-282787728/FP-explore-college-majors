8274996,4,B0019QI0OW,"This series is a short and entertaining documentary about the Murray-Darling River system, and the people who rely on it. John Doyle is quietly amusing (he's Roy from Triple J's Roy and HG sports show) and Professor Tim Flannery is full of useful scientific information.

They make their way along the whole river system in a little dinghy named the Bismark. Along the way, they see some really beautiful country and talk to all sorts of people about the history and future of the river: farmers, families, people who live on houseboats, the Country Women's Association, fishermen, etc.

This is an excellent overview of the rivers that feed Australia, and a real look into Australian characters and personalities.",1260835200,,714,5.0423728813559325
