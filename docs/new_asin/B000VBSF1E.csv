2936279,5,B000VBSF1E,"I rented this video from Netflix.  A seemingly perfect family goes into turmoil when the wife finds her husband in a motel room with not another woman, but with another man.

2936291,4,B000VBSF1E,"This was an excellent movie to deal with the heart breaking subject matter.  I thought the movie was very well done and seemed very realistic, at least how I might expect a family to react to such news.

2936294,2,B000VBSF1E,"The acting was pretty good, but it moved along too slowly and there wasn't much in the story itself to get excited about.  Overall, it was a bit flat.  I wouldn't want to watch it again.",1448323200,,186,4.138888888888889

2936299,1,B000VBSF1E,Such a blah type of movie.,1439424000,,26,3.5
2936300,4,B000VBSF1E,"Accurate and typical: people don't realize how many bi or gay people get married, only to discover they are attracted to same sex people.  Unfortunately, families are part of the causalities.  The ending was unrealistic.",1439164800,,220,5.257142857142857

2936306,4,B000VBSF1E,For some reason I just love these old tv movies and look for them frequently when scrolling through Amazon Instant Video.  Jean Smart's portrayal of a wife forever changed by her husband's admission of being gay was just amazing.,1429574400,2,229,4.871794871794871
2936307,5,B000VBSF1E,Well written...a good book to read on rainy day!,1429401600,,48,4.444444444444445
2936308,3,B000VBSF1E,Watchable but average.,1429228800,,22,6.666666666666667
2936309,3,B000VBSF1E,"Forgot that this was a 1998 made-for-TV movie. Pretty vanilla and very dated. Acting was kind of melodramatic and a little over the top. I understand they were dealing with a very controversial issue for that time. I've always respected Jean Smart for the roles she chooses, both comedy and serious.",1428969600,,299,4.882352941176471

2936314,2,B000VBSF1E,Kinda slow. A good story though,1420761600,,31,4.333333333333333
2936315,2,B000VBSF1E,"I couldn't make it to the end.  It was too stereotypical of the normal married-man-is-really-gay movie, and there was nothing in particular about this film to make me watch after I figured this out.",1417996800,,198,4.823529411764706
2936316,4,B000VBSF1E,"I remember watching this when I was younger and being intrigued by the idea of forgiveness/understanding shown by Smart's character.

What I realized then and better know now  is that the world is never black and white when it comes the intimacies and emotions.  In a moment of anger, red is often the color; but when contemplating the intricacies of a relationship, all primary colors are blended in degrees.

The personalization of those shades vary.  It is the circumstances in life which makes it so.",1417910400,2,504,4.882352941176471
2936317,5,B000VBSF1E,GREAT,1416787200,,5,5.0
2936318,5,B000VBSF1E,"A Very good  and Positive example of how to get through this emotional decision. The issue went through many stages as the actors grew into a rational and accepting change in their lives.  The actors were well chosen and very good in their roles, with Jean Smart exceptionally  good in her part. The ending might be considered predictable but the focus on each stage clarifies the hopes, the wishes, the disappointments and the time to move on of a modern love story. I see it, in a way, as a teaching movie. Susan",1413244800,,514,4.505376344086022
2936319,5,B000VBSF1E,Very meaningful movie that helps point to all sides of a very tough situation.  It definitely opened my eyes a little wider to remember to always forgive and move on.  That is how we grow as people. Well thought-out and put together script.,1413072000,,240,4.558139534883721

2936322,5,B000VBSF1E,I was totally not expecting the outcome of this movie. It was a total shock to me.,1406851200,,82,3.8823529411764706

2936325,2,B000VBSF1E,"The writing for this movie sucked.  Some of the things the characters said actually made me laugh out loud because the comment was so inappropriate.  I laugh hard several times, with the writers not trying to be funny.  Again, good thing to do a movie on it, but get some people who have actually experienced these life changes issue to get you some help in the writing and delivery. Jean Smart is a good actor and I enjoyed her in this movie.",1403395200,,443,4.378048780487805
2936326,5,B000VBSF1E,"It could not have been easy to make this movie salable.  But Jean Smart and company do it with Grace.  Life doesn't always turn out as we planned.  What is important in the end is Love.  And this movie teaches us that if we put Love first, we come out the other side better for it.",1400025600,6,281,3.9642857142857144
2936327,1,B000VBSF1E,This is a Terrible movie.  I kept waiting for it to get better but instead it got worse!  Don't waste your time.,1397779200,,112,4.045454545454546
2936328,4,B000VBSF1E,"this was pretty good introspection of comming out gey by accitent when older. I liked it, it was not to hookey, but at the same time it as a lil flat.",1395273600,,150,3.870967741935484
2936329,3,B000VBSF1E,"I wasn't intrigued and only worth watching once.  Wouldn't recommend this movie to buy, just rent.  Nothing was really wrong with the acting, it just sort of sat there.  It had its day in the sun at one time probably being one of the first shows out there showing admittance of what may have been earlier in their life as unacceptable.",1394150400,,335,4.459016393442623
2936330,4,B000VBSF1E,"While many younger people may not relate, the story presents the very real drama and complications of coming out later in life.

The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that there were no closed captions or subtitles provided for the hearing impaired.",1391126400,,260,4.909090909090909

it is a really GOOD DEAL.",1389657600,,141,3.896551724137931
2936332,4,B000VBSF1E,Difficult to watch but the acting was very good. Emotionally grinding and brings into question the idea of commitment. In end love and family stepped up.,1389312000,3,153,4.923076923076923
2936333,5,B000VBSF1E,"Contains a spoiler. Unlike so many movies these days, this one in particular had something to say. The fine acting certainly helped as I watched in its entirety, giving us a different look at such a serious subject. At least there wasn't four letter words in every sentence. I thought the movie was well done with a refreshing ending.",1385942400,2,334,4.677966101694915
2936334,4,B000VBSF1E,I love Jean Smart and this movie dealt with a subject that is a sign of our times. Was very well done.,1377820800,4,102,3.6818181818181817
2936335,5,B000VBSF1E,"This movie is so realistic and I love Jean Smart. I woudl recommend this to my friends. Love, Love, Love",1374710400,5,104,4.25
2936336,2,B000VBSF1E,"""Change of Heart"" is a typical Lifetime TV movie. It gives the lead female character a formerly familiar situation in which she soon feels herself in unfamiliar territory and out of her depth yet phoenix-like she rises from the ashes of her former existence. So being married for more than 15 years to a man who decides he's now gay fits the bill.

The handling of such complex material and complex emotions was telegraphed in in this movie. Jean Smart's character seemed to sleepwalk throughout the whole revelation.

I also found it cliche that the man the good doctor was shown to be cheating with was so good looking. Why not have a gay love interest be average, or downright homely in appearance? Plain, overweight men need gay loving, too.

Most of all that ending scene with everyone shooting basketball just grated on me. I suppose the game symbolizes that a family that plays together somehow will manage to stay together? Overall, this movie is too pat. Even for Lifetime, this movie is forgettable.",1363651200,2,1009,4.787356321839081
2936337,5,B000VBSF1E,I loved the chemistry between these two beautiful women. I wish the ending could have been different! I watched it over and over! I understood but hated the ending. It was definately worth viewing!,1360454400,,197,4.823529411764706
2936338,2,B000VBSF1E,"Bad story line, boring to watch. I do not recommend this movie. Not real to watch, poor acting. I fast forward to throught the movie.",1360454400,,133,4.36
2936339,5,B000VBSF1E,"This film floored me when it came it and it's just as amazing now.  I'm so thrilled to own this.  The performances are timeless and the story SO REAL (I guess because its based on a true story, DUH lol)  My sister's best friend went through a similar situation, so I'm glad theres a movie out there that captures such a true to life situation.  It's a must see!",1333584000,5,361,4.188405797101449
