I was not expecting a lot, but was surprised that a low-low budget hillbilly fest had so much going on in it. My younger brother turned me on to it because he also heard about it on Youtube. He said that at Arizona State a bunch of freaks and him have made a drinking game out of it. Every time the two lead characters name is said you take a gulp...I'm to old for that now!

Someone mentioned about this being a hoax and the wool being pulled over their eyes (I think it's a dead give away that when the actors names of the film are on the cover and credits are on the back cover...it is not a

hoax.) My brother also asked someone who knows a lot about cameras and she said that it is possible to put

2 hours on a single tape depending on what type of video tape you are using. Also, he checked out the scene where Dwayne gets the gun and he actually picks up a bunch of bullets and put them in his pocket.

I watched it again with him and some of his freaks and each time I saw a little more that I missed the first time. This film is NOT for everyone, but I really dug it. It's a lot better than some of the 70 million dollar crap fests that are shoved down our throats.

The fake documentary that came with it really made you feel that the whole thang was real. Great dirt-cheap movies that kept me interested and wondering what's next?",1176163200,3,1465,4.072916666666667
8427893,2,B000KF0NCK,"While standing in the video store, I read the synopsis of this DVD. I passed on it, but couldn't stop thinking about it. The next time I went to the store, I picked it up and bought it, thinking it was a true documentary. While the first half hour was interesting, it quickly became apparent that this was another Blair Witch, minus the ""big"" budget!! Not once was there mention of buying more ammo for that 6-shot revolver, but he managed to pop off many more shots. Dwayne did make mention of recharging the batteries, but he only stole the camera, nothing else. Finally, it was meant to look like clips from a collection of shots, but they never bought more tape. Little things like this might get passed the average DVD viewer, but not the collector (let's not forget the camera angle in the camper when he killed the family of thieves...Why would he set the camera up across from the door? Better yet, why would he even bring it?). It was a fun way to kill Easter Sunday, though. Had the DVD cover said that it was a reenactment of what they thought happened, I would have given it 4 stars. I don't like people trying to pull wool over my eyes.",1175990400,,1149,4.373831775700935
8427894,4,B000KF0NCK,"A couple weeks ago I saw some insane crime spree clips on YouTube and was like - What the #*%$@ was that and how did it get on YouTube?? Then I saw some more of these type of clips with the same characters in it,  but now they had a notice at the end that said the clips were from a movie called Video X: The Dwayne & Darla Jean Story. They also listed some real film reviewers that seemed to really love the film, so I figured the if the clips were insane, the movie should be too. The packaging says it's a love story and real crime spree caught on tape. I purchased it on Amazon and was pleasantly and Shockingly surprised. It was a guilty pleasure like watching the Anna Nicole Show.

You need to watch this THINKING it is real. If you do, you'll have a fun ride. The filmmakers tried to make it look as real as possible and, to me - they pulled it off. I love things like Blair Witch, real crime stories, and reality TV - so if you do too, you will dig this film.

I only rated it 4 rather than 5 stars as I think 5 stars need to be reserved for things like Scorsese's Mean Streets (which Video X reminds me of) or the Godfather. So 4 stars for this! Enjoy.",1174780800,2,1162,3.9785407725321886
