7863858,5,6304052839,"Gallowglass is the third Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendell's alter ego) novel to be televised by the BBC.  It was originally released in the 1990s and sadly thus far has not been released on DVD or Blu-ray.  It is the story of a young man, recently released from a mental institution, who falls in with a handsome and arrogant fellow who dominates, protects, and exploits him.  The handsome young man is haunted by the memory of a beautiful woman he once helped kidnap, and he forces his pretege into a game of first stalking, then re-kidnapping, his victim. Also part of the story is another young man, divorced with a daughter he adores, who becomes the beautiful woman's protector.

This is another true Vine classic, with multiple twists and turns and surprises and a denouement which is part tragedy, part triumph. Its highly satisfying to watch, and will be worth viewing again and again.",1238544000,4,887,4.777777777777778
