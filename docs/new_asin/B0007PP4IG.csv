8050335,5,B0007PP4IG,"This is volume 2 of a two-part series. I have been studying tai chi at YMAA Boston for the past 3+ years and this video is absolutely fantastic. Master Yang clearly demonstrates take down techniques for about 16 different postures from the tai chi form starting from the parallel hands position. Just as important, you get to see several of his senior students executing the techniques and Master Yang making corrections. If you have an interest in the martial applications of tai chi, this is an excellent. Also don't forget to get volume 1 which reviews the techniques starting from the crossed hands position.",1168300800,,612,4.894230769230769
