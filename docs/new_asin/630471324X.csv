7879000,4,630471324X,"Being an ""old school"" country music fan and more importantly a fan of Carl Smith, I loved this video.
It has a nice variety of '50's performers performing a wide array of the old style country music with a little country humor thrown in.
It appears to be comprised of 4 different shows and sometimes the end of one is cut off a little too quickly, but it doesn't hurt the quality of the video-which is very good.
I would highly recommend this video to country music fans, as well as the seller (choad777).
She was more than willing to correspond with me concerning other videos she has and was courteous and prompt. She even went that extra mile to provide detailed information that I am sure took her some time to obtain.
In short, buy this video from this seller. You won't be disappointed.",1025222400,,792,4.468965517241379
