8226636,5,B000X25FI2,"I purchased this DVD after reading about the life of the late Fanny Cano, a well-known Mexican actress who died in 1983 at the age of 39 in a plane crash in Madrid, Spain. Interesting movie! The obvious influences to me are the Doris Day / Rock Hudson comedies of the late 50s / early 60s, albeit with a Mexican twist; carefree, happy-go-lucky young professional bachelors, chasing and being chased by attractive young ladies. Viewers will recognize a very young Jorge Rivero in this film. It's a nice lighthearted comedy that probably represents Mexican cinema of that period, the mid 1960s. I'm new to the genre, but will be looking for more movies that featured the late Ms. Cano, who was a superstar of the Spanish-speaking world in her day.

Not a heavy melodrama or explicit nudity, but rather a DELICIOUS & TRULY HILARIOUS MILD BATTLE OF THE SEXES COMEDY. I found myself laughing at the extremes the men in the movie go to make sure their women finally marry them, when it's the ladies who really are setting the traps to make them walk down the aisle directly to the altar! As the FINE CAST is listed in the opening credits THIS IS A FIGHT TO BE WON BY THE GIRLS! MARICRUZ OLIVIER, FANNY CANO & HILDA AGUIRRE VS. JOAQUIN CORDERO, JORGE RIVERO & HORACIO SALINAS, THIS IS A MATCH THAT STARTED ALL THE WAY BACK IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN WITH ADAM & EVE!! AND ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LADIES PARADE IN SEXY BIKINIS!! FOR MATURE AUDIENCES & THOSE WHO APPRECIATE WHAT GOOD MEXICAN CINEMA FROM THE 60's WAS!!",1298246400,3,1030,5.136904761904762
