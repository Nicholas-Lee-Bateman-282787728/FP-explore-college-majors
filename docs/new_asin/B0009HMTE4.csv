8061047,5,B0009HMTE4,"Is this an older recording? Yes. Are the graphics HD and crystal clear? Of course not - this was done in the early 90s by A&E, for heaven's sake. So why the 5 stars? Because the information given is still a fantastic primer in the history and use of Astrology by many cultures and peoples throughout time... and also because Leonard Nimoy's narration will forever be a joy to listen to. Sadly, there are not a lot of video options for learning astrology or about astrology's history. This A&E documentary is one of the best and even if the graphic quality is not what we are all now used to, it does not make the information presented any less fascinating or relevant. I am very happy that this DVD is still being offered and would highly recommend that anyone looking to add to their astrology, divination, or metaphysical learning library go ahead and purchase this DVD to add to the collection. If you want information about astrology's use in other cultures and in history, this is a wonderful and fascinating introduction. Until a better documentary is made with state of the art graphics and HD recording, this is still the best DVD overviewing the topic of astrology, its use in ancient cultures, and its relevancy from Biblical times to modern. Just in case anyone is unclear, this is NOT an instructional DVD, but it is a fascinating look at the art, science, and history of this ancient craft.",1432339200,,1403,4.661290322580645
