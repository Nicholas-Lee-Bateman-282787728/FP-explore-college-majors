4041954,4,B002ZL0RQY,"Love this show and DO recommend it - but not for youngsters!  But, as is too often the case, The disc quality is so-so. Washing two of the discs seems to have cleared the problem on them but two other discs (season 20) arrived severly scratched because the case was damaged and the discs slid around during shipment - so, parts of the show I must skip over.  Not good, Sony!",1272240000,,374,4.253521126760563

8385144,5,B002ZL0RQY,This is such a fun and original show.  The cast of actors was chosen perfectly for the story line.  The final season is a little weak (unsurprising for a long running show) as the writers and actors kind of fall into caricature of their roles.,1373155200,,243,4.377777777777778

My son-in-law is a volunteer firefighter and really loves this series, so he was thrilled to have the complete set for Christmas  and not have to wait for the last season.  He's not easy to buy for, so this was an ideal gift for him.",1327190400,,345,4.196969696969697

8385150,4,B002ZL0RQY,"This show is about a group of New York City firefighters at a firehouse in New York (62 Truck). The show revolves around the job of being a firefighter New York, the post-911 psychological repercussions on firefighters in the city, and the personal lives of a group of firefighters.
The show is largely entertaining and has an addictive quality to it despite moderately subpar writing in the earlier seasons and characters you mostly don't care about except for maybe the lead character, Tommy Gavin, who is played by Denis Leary.

Denis Leary really brings to life the character of Tommy Gavin who is a very flawed alcoholic. I find myself watching this show mainly because Tommy is such an engaging character and he has an interesting relationship with his wife, Janet.  The relationship between these two and the crazy situations Tommy gets himself into all of the time is what mostly drive this show for the first four seasons. It is not until the 5th season where the show actually began to really become humorous and display some frequent laugh-out-loud moments. The writers seem to decide what type of show they want Rescue ME to be sometime towards the end of the 4th season. After this season, viewers may still be watching the show mainly for Tommy but there is more to keep you engaged.

The rest of characters are mainly either annoying or just plain not very interesting for the first few seasons.  You basically have your player/playboy firefighter who seems to try too hard to play the part but he actually becomes more likeable later. There are the two unbelievably idiotic younger firefighters (one is so stupid you feel like throwing the remote at the television almost every time he is onscreen). You also have the fat middle-aged firefighter who seems to be able to get in bed with hot women simply because he is a firefighter, and you have Jerry, the chief who seems to be more like a father figure to the rest of the guys probably because he has trouble accepting his own son's lifestyle. Larenz Tate becomes a part of the cast in season 4 and adds much power, diversity and personality to the show.

I got the feeling early on that if either of these guys or any other character on the show happened to meet their deaths I would probably not care much. It is no major spoiler to state that more than one of the frequent characters on the show do meet their deaths and it really didn't seem to be too sad  of an occasion from a viewer standpoint. This is obviously due to the biggest flaw of the show in the beginning...the writing.

Make no mistake that Rescue Me suffers from some moderate writing flaws such as:

-Characters casually disappear from the show and many times without explanation and some reappear out of nowhere.

-One character in one of the later seasons is billed as mentally challenged but seem to display more intelligence than at least a couple of the firefighters.

- Another character is told by a physician that he/she has chronic illness only after viewing a MRI and running blood test. The diagnosis in question is not a radiological or hematological diagnosis. In other words, the diagnosis cannot be made by MRI or blood work.

- There is excessive use of hallucinations and nightmares.

-One character commits suicide and it happens so abruptly and without warning signs. It felt just tacked on at the last second as if contract negotiations for the actor playing the character could not be reached.

-One character seems to have nothing else better to do with his life but to be available every single time Tommy needs to talk to or meet up with him.

-Tommy seems to have an endless wad of cash. He can cause or be the victim of huge amounts of property damage but still have the cash to brush it off to the side.

-Death is overdone

The most annoying thing about the plot in the show is that things only seem to get worse and worse for the characters. It seems that only through misfortune after misfortune can the writers attempt to make the show interesting. Just to illustrate this point, if one of the characters gets hit by a bus one day, his mother will die later that night and his house will get caught on fire in the morning and while digging under the rubble he will find his wife having sex with the mailman. I may be exaggerating a bit here but some moments in the show actually feels this way at times.

Despite the flaws, the show does provide a moderate amount of entertainment as long as you don't take it too seriously which the show seems to do substantially for most of its episode. I just finished the 5th season which really has some nice humorous moments which is a huge step away from some of the depressing moments featured so frequently in the earlier seasons. Matter-of-fact, there are frequent laugh-out-loud moments in season 5 that would have made earlier seasons much more enjoyable if they were implemented.

Overall, I believe rescue me worth the time if viewers are determined to get past the shortcomings of the first few seasons. Staying along for the ride into the later seasons such as the latter part of the 4 and mostly 5 are beneficial if you are looking for a show that is moderately entertaining with some good laughs. You just will have to trudge through the tears first.",1277769600,,5271,4.613247863247863
