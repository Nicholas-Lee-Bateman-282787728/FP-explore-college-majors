8579902,5,B003NGLSNG,"This entertaining and award winning documentary from Kate Marshall Graphics features an abundance of well researched information about black bear cubs from birth through the first year and a half. It provides basic facts about necessary components for healthy bear habitats; explains how a lack of human understanding negatively impacts this and what is being done to minimize the problems. Some extremely delightful scenes in this DVD show close up views of a sow in a winter den grooming her cubs and guiding them to nurse successfully. As curious cubs emerge with their mother in the spring they learn everything they need to know as they explore their surroundings. It is amazing to witness the balance and agility of these growing youngsters as they search for fruits and nuts in the fall trees to put on the weight needed for the upcoming winter. This DVD offers fantastic photography and interesting information that increases awareness and positive understanding of the behavior and actions of the dynamics within bear families. I recommend all 3 DVD Season of the Bear by Kate Marshall Graphics.  - A. F. Carter, Michigan",1338768000,,1130,5.075268817204301
