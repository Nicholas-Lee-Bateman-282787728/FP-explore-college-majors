8425220,4,B004DEPOKA,"The title of this review reflects some of the central issues that the documentary portrays vividly, as does the title of the film.  Most of the story takes place in a restricted access ward of an Israeli hospital near one of the Gaza checkpoints along the Palestine-Israeli border.

The main focus of the story is the life & death struggle that a Palestinian baby faces as he undergoes treatment to obtain a normal auto-immune system.  The search for a suitable donor is complicated by the antagonistic political and military tensions that exist between the 2 neighboring countries.

The preciousness of human life is the primary motivation of the deeply humanitarian Israeli doctor who undertakes the virtually overwhelming task of finding a bone marrow donor for baby Muhammed Abu Mustafa. Before I reveal the response of the baby's mother, I'll only state at this point that the reply of young Muhammed's mother, Raida, is, in my opinion, not only complex and revealing but also a fundamental turning point in the documentary.

SPOILER WARNING: two of Raida's daughters previously have died at very young ages from the same disorder that her young son faces, the absence of a normal auto-immune system.  Raida's grave concern for the survival of baby Muhammed at the hands of an Israeli brings to light her basic distrust of the Israeli people as well as her suspicion about the real motives of the Israeli doctor.

At one point the physician mentions his belief that all human life is precious.  When he asks her if she agrees, Raida counters that death is the stark reality of existence for her people.  She expands on this harsh belief by commenting that Palestinians aspire to death in the tradition of ""shahid"" (meaning both martyr and holy witness) and claims that she would be proud if young Muhammed survived from his grave illness so that he could die in this ""noble"" way.  Later she recants this belief, explains why she said it in the first place and strongly embraces the Israeli doctor's belief in the preciousness of life.

So, what does Raida really believe?  Does she genuinely embrace ""shahid""?  Although it's arguable whether or not the documentary answers these 2 questions, here's my view of these key issues in this fascinating documentary.

Although the film does not CONCLUSIVELY establish whether Raida's initial pro-martyr statement or her later assertion of the preciousness of life is what she truly believes, I am of the opinion that she believes the latter in her heart.  Her apparent joy and relief at the eventual survival of baby Muhammed seems compelling evidence to me that Raida considers, as would any loving mother, the life of her child to be precious, even if it means risking the distrust of her Gazan neighbors and friends.

It seems obvious to me that Raida was savvy enough to realize that open rejection of the ""shahid"" belief would be considered blasphemy and result in her death.  If my opinion is accurate, then dying as a blasphemer would deny Raida the opportunity to love and care for her son.  That is conclusive enough evidence that she considers not only her son's life but also her own to be precious.",1306368000,7,3158,4.882022471910112
8425221,5,B004DEPOKA,"No, the film itself isn't complicated, but (as the film shows) the Palestinian -Israeli situation sure is.

If you're looking for an upbeat, uplifting film, this isn't the one for you.  This film is a documentary that tells the story of a Palestinian woman from Gaza who has a baby that needs serious medical treatment.  This medical treatment isn't available in Gaza and the Israeli government lets her come to Israel for help.  One problem -- The operation is going to cost $55,000.

Okay, that's not really the only problem.  For one thing, this Palestinian woman is scared to death.  No, she's not scared about the operation.  She's scared to death of the Israelis!  She has been told all her life what monsters these people are and now she is living in their hospital!  I won't spoil the film by going into any more details about what happens to her and her baby.  There are some wonderful moments and some very sad moments.  At one point, you just can't believe what the Palestinian woman has to say to her Israeli benefactors.  It's frightening.

During the filming of this documentary, Israel invades Gaza.  A Palestinian doctor from Gaza, who works in the Israeli hospital, finds out that three of his daughters have been killed by the IDF.  Like I said, this film isn't particularly uplifting.  What is pretty uplifting however, is that this Palestinian doctor, Izzeldin Abuelaish, subsequently went on to write a book titled ""I Shall Not Hate.""

If you're interested in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict/situation, then this film is really a ""must see"" for you.  It is very well made and tells a very interesting (though sometimes incredibly sad) story.",1304035200,10,1663,4.875
