1883506,3,B00009KTYH,"I have the Scooby Doo Golden Collection and I think it's great to have loads of Scooby Doo episodes together in one collection. These new episodes are great but giving us 4 at a time is not a good idea and I really think Warner would have been better off investing their time (as we would invest our money) in a First Season Box Set.
What we are given for now are four episodes running 22 minutes each. A couple of them have below average stories but the other two are up to scratch. The animation and color pallet are very bright and modern as is the soundtrack which incorporates more original music than the old school shows (which tended to re-use temp scores and source music over and over) but manages to work in familiar themes.
For Scooby Doo purists there is no sacrilege here. Shaggy and Scooby/Fred are performed by Casey Kasem and Frank Welker so there's not too much of a divide between this and old school to distance older fans from the new show.
For what it is, the DVD presents the show absolutely flawlessly in 1.33:1 full frame with pretty active Dolby 2.0 surround and some minimal fluff extras. Buy it cheap and hope for a Season Box Set.",1087084800,15,1159,4.420560747663552
1883507,4,B00009KTYH,"If you have enjoyed the series of new Scooby Doo movies releases in the past few years (Witch's Ghost, Zombie Island, Legend of the Vampire) you will enjoy these episodes from the new Scooby Doo series currently airing on Cartoon Network. The stories in this series are fairly simple but likeable anyway, focusing on the antics of Shaggy and Scooby. Having seen every incarnation of Scooby and pals from Scooby Doo, Where are You? to the 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo, this series definitely holds it's own and even surpasses some of the classic Scooby series (most notably ""the Scooby & Scrappy Show"").
Buy it, rent it, watch it...if you are a Scooby fan, you will like it!",1056412800,,668,4.669491525423729
1883508,5,B00009KTYH,"Bought for my 3 year old granddaughter.  She loves all things scooby doo.  We had family night movie evening and we all enjoyed it with her.
The movie is enjoyable and no bloody violence. Scooby is hard to find in the stores.  I shop Amazon.com all the time and was very happy to find it. Thank you!",1344988800,,299,4.2105263157894735

1883510,5,B00009KTYH,My son likes his Scooby-Doo he has in VHS and needed it in DVD for travel and Amazon made that easy by having choices new or used and different prices so I could fit it into my budget and it ships very quickly have not been disappointed yet by the DVD's we have replaced for him.,1330905600,,279,4.0
1883511,4,B00009KTYH,"My kids are absolutely happy. We've been collecting all of the scooby doos. Every time the mail comes I see a smiling face. To be honest I tend to watch some of the episodes with them and I think the kids like scooby and the gang because their funny and innocent and down to earth. I prefer these types of cartoons compared to the new ones-which on TV are completely inappropriate for smaller kids. I think it makes my kids use their imagination more; each one allows them to play a part; They try to solve the mysteries as they watch. The Space Ape at the cape was a good one they liked the multiple shows. You know its kid like...The kids like them; Who am I, an Adult to say, Oh!! this cartoon is this and that. They love them all. Thats all that matters. A++ in my book.",1300233600,,774,4.166666666666667

1883513,5,B00009KTYH,This movie is perfect for young children.  I was surprised to see how much my daughter is into Scooby Doo but she loves this cartoon more than any other.  This is a great buy because it has four separate episodes and extras that she loves.,1286841600,,239,4.288888888888889

1883516,4,B00009KTYH,"I was more than happy when i saw that they had a new updated version of Scooby Doo out there.  I know its not the original, but it really cant be.  Its something i watched when i was kid and love still do til this day.  But i actually do enjoy this new updated version of Scooby Doo.  If you have any love for Scooby Doo, you would do well check this one out.  I know that there are many changes and such to it.  But you still have the whole Mystery Inc gang there and they are still doing their thing.  Solving crimes, busting up bad guys and still getting called those ""meddling kids"" by folks busted in the act.  Plus there are 4 episodes of the show the disc as well as the other volumes of What's New Scooby Doo.  Not a bad price at all, you might be able to find it cheaper.  But no big deal, in ending the new Scooby Doo is more than enough to satisfy my praise for the first.

Plus the Mystery Machine is still taking the gang wherever they wanna go.",1127088000,3,958,3.9894736842105263

7991093,1,B00009KTYH,"The reason for the one star is because of the unplayable condition of the DVD sold to me by green_earth_books.  From what I could see of the of the episodes through the scratches, fingerprints, and freezes looked really cute.  But to be honest regarding my actual viewing of the DVD WHAT'S NEW SCOOBY-DOO, VOL,1-SPACE APE AT THE CAPE was short and limited due to the terrible condition of the DVD.
So, here are the titles of the episodes:  1) There's No Creature Like Snow Creature, 2)  Space Ape at the Cape, 3)  3-D Struction, and 4)  Big Scare In the Big Easy.
I also tried to watch the Special Features but all I could see were bits of Velma's music video and one other video. The pictures and the sound were so bad because of all the scratches, freezes, and prints that my DVD player stopped and wouldn't continue playing the DVD.
As soon as I get my money back from the seller I plan on replacing the DVD.",1426377600,,911,4.3609467455621305
