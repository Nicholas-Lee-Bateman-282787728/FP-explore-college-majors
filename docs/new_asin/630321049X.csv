False Teeth OR Real Teeth
Genuine Leather OR Imitation Leather (vinyl)
Diamond Ring OR Glass Ring
Real Money OR Counterfeit Money

Obviously, we won't need to guess at your answers, because we already know your answer! How? Because NO ONE in the entire world, would ever take the false for the real, given the choice (if money permits).

And that's what the GENESIS PROJECT is all about: namely, to tell the Genesis Story of Creation in the native tongues (Hebrew / Aramaic) using actors from the region with both looks and accent of the ""ancients"", those ancestors of us all, who first walked the earth as first fruits amongst the people of the world.

No, you needn't be able to understand Hebrew or Aramaic tongue, because, as the actors are speaking their own native languages, the languages of the Bible, for all us naive mono-linguistic Americans that speak only English, the production has ""voice-over"" using a beautiful (male) baritone / bass voice who speaks from the KJV (King James Version) in a most resonant voice, the Scriptures of the same account, all the while during which, the actors are speaking Hebrew and Aramaic in the background! This GENESIS PROJECT is a STUNNING WORK to say the least!

But you don't have an old VHS player anymore, you say? Not to worry! They now have businesses in every town that CONVERT old VHS tapes to DVD formatting! So, even if you order the VHS version of the GENESIS PROJECT, you can then easily have these tapes CONVERTED over to DVD format, without spending a fortune.

But, you ask, is it worth all that?

Answer: If your preference is having the REAL instead of the FAKE, then by all means, YES, IT'S WORTH IT!

What are you waiting for?

Find the VHS tapes of THE GENESIS PROJECT and order it ASAP! And it will take you back in time, to the beginning of time, when Deity (also known as God) decided to create the heavens and the earth and all that is therein!

NOTE: If you're so shallow as to only want to watch the latest on Saturday Night Live, then you will need more than ""mercy shown"" on Judgment Day, and I pity you.",1383523200,2,2132,4.543080939947781
