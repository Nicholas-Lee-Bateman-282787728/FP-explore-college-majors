8590737,5,B00D91LIOY,One of my greatest memories was watching Paul Winchell with his group on Saturday mornings.  So glad to be able to wath them and reminisce. Thank you for the great service.,1448236800,2,172,4.548387096774194
8590738,4,B00D91LIOY,"It was fun to see Jerry Mahoney, Paul Winchell, and Knucklehead Smiff.  Paul Winchell is one of the best ventriloquists ever, as well as being really funny.  I watched them often as a kid, but I don't recall the actual shows,  as I was only 3 when these aired!  I'm hoping to find more Jerry & Knuck, but hopefully without Rudy Kazootie and Howdie Doodie.",1388966400,3,355,4.415384615384616
