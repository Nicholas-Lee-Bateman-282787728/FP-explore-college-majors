8676405,4,B00N5ND2IQ,This is a fine film... slow going...the house is the star... you need to be receptive to a different way of telling a story...very glad we watched it....,1482883200,,153,4.5

8676407,1,B00N5ND2IQ,"Sigh.... this one is excruciating. Painful to watch. Again, the themes are significant but this is a step above a home video. How many times do we need to watch this woman masturbate awkwardly?  This film makes her other films seem interesting",1440806400,4,243,4.785714285714286
8676408,3,B00N5ND2IQ,"I love Joanna Hoggs and I feel she doesn't make enough movies.  When I found out she was directing Exhibition I was already in line for my ticket.  But I found this movie to be ok at best.  It's about a couple living in a house of very contemporary design.  Something you might expect a young, artsy couple to live in rather than an older couple like these two.  The husband thinks it's time to move from the house while the wife is rather attached to it... VERY attached.  She literally has an erotic relationship with it.  Often using the house and it's furniture to get herself off.  When the husband tries to engage with her sexually she often isn't interested....but she does get turned on by the house.

Strangely enough she's also somewhat afraid of the house whenever she has to spend too much time alone in it... and she is also apparently afraid of leaving the house late at night.  There is an implication that something bad happened to them either inside or right outside the house at one point in the past, but we never figure out what that bad thing might have been.

There is one scene where we see her having sex with her husband, but the way she's rubbing up on the couch makes it seem like a threesome.  Slowly we see her start to move closer to her husband and being able to let go of the house.  It's an interesting movie, but we are left with too many questions.  I'm ok with unknowns in film, but feel that there is a line where if there are too many of them, you cease to care about the story and the characters.  And I think there are just too many questions with this film and it leaves us not caring as much as we should have.",1432252800,,1652,4.25
8676409,5,B00N5ND2IQ,"A really daring and formally original characterization of two artists and the domestic space they inhabit.  Just because the people, the building, and the tone of the film are chilly doesn't mean they aren't worth our attention.  To the contrary, this was the most striking attempt I can recall of a filmmaker involving us in the lifestyles of people who don't necessarily lead with their emotions, even within the intimacy of a longterm couple, which isn't the same as not HAVING emotions.  Unrelated is still my favorite movie by this director, but if you respond to stylistically different and subtly demanding films, I'd whole-heartedly recommend this.  A wonderful surprise for me.",1420329600,3,686,5.153153153153153
8676410,4,B00N5ND2IQ,"Its like real everyday life, this isn't exactly a film for everyone if you are just going to watch it for tom hiddleston don't write a review about it.",1418083200,,151,4.241379310344827

8676412,2,B00N5ND2IQ,"Excruciating in many ways, slow and dreary. A nice exploration of a work of modernist architecture; a poor exploration of two opaque characters locked in a difficult relationship. Struck me as a second rate imitation of an old Antonioni film. The New York Times review made it sound interesting. It really wasn't.",1415404800,6,313,5.038461538461538
