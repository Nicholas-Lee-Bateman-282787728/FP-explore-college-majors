8558529,5,B00AWRC4BY,"I love this workout!  I feel so strong and accomplished after it's done.  This intense weight workout is part of Cathe's Xtrain series.  You will work your biceps and your triceps, alternating between these muscle groups.  Since you alternate muscle groups, there is little rest between sets.  There are nine rounds and no exercise is repeated.

On this DVD:
Bi's & Tri's - 45:34
Bonus Core #1 - 10:26
Bonus Core #2 - 12:30
100 Rep Challenge Bicep Curls - 6:50
110 Rep Challenge Flat Bench Triceps Extensions - 7:15.

Why I love this workout:

* The long premixes.  Since I love to workout for an hour, I usually do the Bi's & Tri's plus a core workout; this makes for an hour.  There are lots of premixes, both longer and shorter so there's something for everyone.

* The nice flowing warm up.  There was something so pleasant about this warm up; you get the blood pumping to every part of your body.

* Nice mix of traditional and new exercises.  You'll do some traditional exercises like bicep curls and triceps extensions.  Cathe has also added some new twists, like bicep curls with dumbbell and resistance tubing.  I have a love hate relationship with this exercise.  For the new twists, Cathe uses 5 pounds and medium resistance tubing.  I use 3 pounds and light resistance tubing and I can barely finish the reps.  And I thought my biceps were getting stronger. Ah, something to work towards.

* The hard exercises.  The other killer exercise is the one arm plank with kickbacks.  Can we say core power?

* Since no exercise is repeated, there is no dread factor.  As much as I love exercise, there are always a few exercises that I don't like.  In this case, it doesn't matter since each exercise is over before you know it.

* Core workouts.  I especially enjoy the Core #2 Workout since there are no full sit-ups, like there are in Core #1.  The side arm get up is good training for the Turkish get up move for kettlebells.

* Minimal equipment needed.  All you need are dumbbells, stability ball and resistance tubing.

* The instrumental music wasn't annoying.  Funny thing to put as a positive, I know.  But, I normally don't like Cathe's taste in music.  Several other Xtrain DVDs have vocals and they are so loud, it's hard to hear Cathe sometimes.  This music was just right as background music.

There is one thing to note about this workout.  Doing nine rounds of biceps and triceps exercises may not be for everyone.  With all the premixes, you can always do fewer sets.  These weren't negatives for me, since I love working with weights.

I recommend this workout to anyone wanting a serious weight workout.",1364688000,4,2628,4.591792656587473
