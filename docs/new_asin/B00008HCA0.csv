1847672,3,B00008HCA0,"i would like to say tha this dvd is a must for every fan of the wwe , a 3 hours dvd with several extras and bonus , ijust got this one 2 days ago and it was very entertaining , but don't expect any surprise from this one because all good fan saw every and each one fo raw best moments :stone cold and his truck or dx and the rock but this dvd contains all the stuffs inside ,so just get it,3 hours man !!!!",1050192000,,406,3.67816091954023
1847673,2,B00008HCA0,"Ok, yeah I didn't buy the DVD. The show was okay though. It obviously didn't live up to the hype, as many of us were expecting surprise appearances from the likes of Hogan, Austin, Mick Foley, or Bret Hart. As far as the extras go? I was hoping for better. Doesn't seem worth it. I would have wanted the 5 nominees for match of the decade to be featured instead of just the winner (TLC 4), which I rank 4th among the TLC matches there have been. As far as the extra RAW moments go, I've got most of them on the Best of RAW DVD's. Now there's what you guys should buy. Don't bother with this. Get the Best of RAW Vols. 1,2, and 3. They've got better extra features, and they highlight the really great years of RAW that mattered (late '97- late 2000).",1050105600,2,750,4.1438356164383565
1847674,5,B00008HCA0,"This show was severely hyped by WWE and then severely panned by internet critics. I didn't see this show when it was broadcast so I was a little reluctant to buy the DVD. I did buy it and it was money well spent. The DVD is packed with extras that are well worth the price of the DVD by themselves. The actual awards show was a lot better than the internet `smarts' made it out to be. This is professional wrestling people!!, sports entertainment, if you will. It's not the Academy Awards, it's not supposed to be a serious awards show. And `yes' the WWE superstars stay in character. My advice is don't listen to the negative criticism. This DVD is a great record of 10 brilliant years of Raw.",1049760000,4,694,4.346153846153846
1847675,5,B00008HCA0,This DVD is worth buying solely because of the historical significance attached to this event as well as the extras on the DVD. It is very rare that a WWE awards show was on sale for DVD/VHS. This show I personally liked a lot and the DVD extras are 100% worth the price. If you don't want to pay a lot for the DVD then buy it second hand...but its worth a buy for all you WWE DVD collector's.,1049414400,,393,3.9873417721518987
1847676,3,B00008HCA0,"As panned as the original television broadcast of this show was, I expected nothing less than complete garbage.  I entered into watching this DVD with the lowest possible expectations.  I can honestly say that the 10th Anniversary show for RAW was better than I expected.  I can also honestly say that it still wasn't that good of a show.
For a 10 year special show for Monday Night RAW, I would have expected something special.  The WWE had advertised past superstars, suggesting Steve Austin (he was not with the company at the time of the broadcast), Bret Hart, Mick Foley, and Bobby Heenan.  It would have been nice to see Ted Dibiase, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan (not sure where he was at the time), or the Ultimate Warrior.  The returning legends for the broadcast were Mene Gene Oakerlund and Pat Patterson.  Not what you'd call a marquee lineup.  The only top level superstars that were at the show were those that are current employees wrestling today.  The hype that the WWE put forth led to the let-down in the show.
The format of the show itself was as an awards show.  Shawn Michaels gives an award for Diva of the Decade (nominees being Sable, Chyna, Sunny, Lita, and Trish Stratus).  Trish gets up and gives a mini-speech.  We see short clips of the Top 10 RAW Retro moments throughout the show.  It comes off as a weak awards show and is not special at all.
There are several extras dealing with the creation of the RAW 10th Annivesary Show, there is a load of other RAW Retro moments, a series of interviews taken from the show, a bonus award presentation or two.  Then, there are two bonus matches.  One is the main event from the first RAW episode.  Undertaker vs Damien Demento.  This was somewhat of a short match and not very interesting.  It is notable only because it is the very first main event on RAW.  The other bonus match was voted the RAW match of the Decade: Tables, Ladders, Chairs 4.  This is the one good extra on the disc, but not enough reason to buy the DVD.",1048204800,,1993,4.483333333333333
1847677,4,B00008HCA0,"I find it very interesting that most of the reviews here where posted way before the DVD was even released, and speak only about the what was broadcasted on TV.  Seems like someone's trying to jump the gun just to get their name on the Internet.

I agree that the show it self did not live to its expectations.  But any WWE fan would love to have this DVD simply because of all the EXTRA footage included.  Not to mention that lame or not, the actual event will gain nostalgic value as we look back a few years from now.  Here are ALL of the extras:

1847678,1,B00008HCA0,One of the most hyped anniversary shows ever and it turned out to be a tremendous let down. This was not fun to watch or entertaining in anyway. Another poster said that people were mad because no suprises at all. Maybe that is partially true but when the writers for this show didn't fully know the history it creates a problem. Take for instance... Raw match of the decade - TLC 5? Horrible pick! That match was a letdown all itself. The worst match of the series. You cannot tell me that was the best match in their existance because it was not. I would have been happy with Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam in a Raw Ladder match but I still know there was better out there. WWE creative is trying real hard but they just are not in touch with the wrestling scene or in touch with what the fans want to see. This is will be a bad DVD to sell because not many people want to see this poor excuse again!,1047686400,,902,4.130681818181818
1847679,5,B00008HCA0,"Alot of people said they hated this show because they thought they were going to see classic WWE superstars attend the show. That's what they thought of the show. I enjoyed the show, I thought it was great so who cares if some old timers didn't show up, the show was really great. I recommend buying thid DVD.",1047168000,,309,4.344827586206897
1847680,1,B00008HCA0,"The Raw X show was a complete let down and nothing special. The show was supposed to be a celebration of the first 10 years from raw, however, the first 6 years are mostly ignored! Only the more recent Raw moments are featured. A complete waste of a show and further proof that the wwe ship is sinking.",1046563200,,302,4.224137931034483
1847691,3,B00008HCA0,"First off they did ignore the first 5 years of Raw and yes, we did get to vote on the categorys but they were picked by WWE officals. The superstar category omitted Diesel (Dont know why), Bret Hart (due to Heat with WWE), Razor Ramon (alot of outside problems), and I belive Stone Cold (walked out). All wrestlers were a big part of Raw, and all the categorys where choosen from 1999 and on, when WWE became huge with Stone Cold, The Rock, DX, and The WCW Monday Night Wars. . Its called the Ten Year anniversey but it barely covers early years. I love old wrestling footage, so of course I tuned in but when I saw heard about it, but it was a huge disappointment. The only reason why I got the DVD is because I love the TLC 4 Match and I wanted to see it again, when I heard it was on this dvd in complete form I snagged a used copy for cheap. I wouldnt pay more then 10 dollars for this dvd, it is a big disappointment.",1107475200,2,922,4.043715846994536
1847692,4,B00008HCA0,"The Tenth anniversary special is a great look back at all the Holy Sh*t moments of WWE RAW. A lot of moments have their own chapter, and you can flip through any of them that you want. Anything you can think off is on here. From Mankind winning the title, to Stone Cold filling Mr. McMahon's car with cement. Even those that you don't see anywhere else, like when Angle sprayed milk on Stone Cold and his pals, and when Jericho arrived, are on this DVD.

The best Raw match ever, TLC 4, was not the best of the TLC matches, but definately worth your time to see it. Lots of mayhem and some surprisingly brutal falls off ladders and through tables are shown in this one. The best moment of the night would have to be when Jeff was on top of the ladder outside the ring with another ladder set up behind him and jumped off right onto Kane through a table! The moment when Jericho falls off the ladder, right out of the ring to the floor would have to be another great moment. This is definately a great Raw match.

Lets not forget this is the only DVD I've seen that has TLC 4 on it, and where they had footage of when they shot RAW on the roof. They also have lots of interviews, but each one could have been a lot longer than what they were, I guess nothing is perfect after all. The TLC match was awsome, it had a lot of moments that made you sit on the edge of your seat, and it also became match of the Decade, for those of you who didn't see it on RAW.

The only bad things that I have to say is that the extra matches are only TLC 4 and Raw's first main event, which is five minutes long by the way. They should have added all the nominee matches on it in their entirety. Also some other moments, like the steel cage match between Angle and Benoit, and when DX invaded WCW, aren't shown in their entirety. And some moments with Shawn and Mick Foley aren't on it either. But other than those, this is definately a peice of history and should be owned by any fan.",1093392000,3,1966,4.101298701298702
1847693,4,B00008HCA0,"Despite popular belief that this is a worthless DVD that doesn't live up to it's expectations, let us remember that this is an anniversary show, and all the best bits were VOTED by US, or YOU, the public.  So, it is very much irrelevent that there is too much emphasis on 'the austin era' as that is exactly what the public voted as the most entertaining moments in the history of RAW.
Now that is cleared up, we can see that the actul ceremony on the DVD is not that bad, many of the top names were in attendance, The Rock via satellite, Jericho, HBK, Triple H, Kane ect, so to say that the show was below-par does not cut the mustard.  Within the awards bash, many great moments are mentioned, and shown in segments, such as the infamous Austin vs Tyson on RAW, Owen Hart Tribute and the time that DX invaded WCW.
As far as features are concerned, there is the complete, unforgettable TLC match from 2002 which was voted Best Match from RAW, and there are many clips taken from RAW's history that are only available on DVD, such as JR kissing Vince's backside, Mae Young getting powerbombed through a table by Buba-Ray Dudley and a short summary of why Bret Hart left WWE on bad terms with Vince.
There are some short interviews from the after-awards bash, look out for the hilarious reaction from Big Show and Pual Hayman, and also William Regal.
The only area that lets this DVD down is that they could have included four or five matches instead of two under the MATCHES section, and they also could have made the clips longer regarding the RETRO MOMENTS, as some were condensed to a mere 15 seconds, when a full minute should have been used, after all, this is a DVD! where WWE could have elaborated on this for the fans.  That is why I cannot give this a 5/5 rating.
Unfortunately Stone Cold Steve Austin was absent, but this was due to him leaving the WWE several months prior to the show, and it is frustrating that he did, in fact, return within a month of the show being aired, (if only he had come back four weeks sooner!)
However, it is a decent enough DVD with entertaining features and excellent footage.  Do not buy this if you are simply a casual fan as the DVD is expensive at about 16.99 in the UK, but if you are a true fan of the WWE and its history, then this is a must buy to your collection, as much of the content is pure gold.",1080777600,3,2351,4.3122171945701355
1847694,1,B00008HCA0,"Geez, was this a horrible ""anniversary show"".  I can't believe the WWE even put this on DVD.  They basically ignored the first five years of RAW, so what was the point?  This show got so many well-deserved negative reviews when it aired on TNN.  Invest your money on other worthy wrestling events.",1071187200,,297,4.653846153846154
1847695,1,B00008HCA0,"I don't own the DVD so I can't comment on the special features, but this had to be the biggest disappointment ever.  At the time Stone Cold Steve Austin was on hiatus from the WWE after walking out the year before.  WWE kept bringing notions on their television show that Austin would return at the special but after the superstar of the year was announced we all were left in disappointment.  Plus WWE seemed to only award athletes who were in the organization at the time of the show.  I can't see why they called it the tenth anniversary when all they did was really show highlights of the Austin era to time of release.  Another reason why professional wrestling has lost its fans is this show.  A huge disappointment and not even worth the one star for the lowest rating that it can be rated.",1069372800,2,797,4.424657534246576
1847696,5,B00008HCA0,"For all of you ... let me explain it to you. It has all of the Raw openings from all 10 years of Raw, It has about a million Raw Retro moments, it has extra awards, lots of interviews and many more extras included. Not just that but this was a great show already, I really enjoyed watching this on TV and reliving the first 10 years of Raw.",1063411200,,340,3.9420289855072466

1847698,3,B00008HCA0,"The clips were good, but too short.  It didn't ""fill my appetite"" in seeing the retro clips.
I did enjoy the ""easter egg"" of the gimmicks photo gallery, seeing all of the wrestlers from the ""federation"" era that didn't quite make it.
Biggest thing that I noticed was that whenever the ""scratch"" WWF logo was shown, it was blurred out, but the older ""block"" WWF logo was left alone - that didn't make sense.
I agree with others that it should have been a 2-disc set, basically to show the history of the nominees/matches/etc., rather than just the small clips that were shown.  Hopefully they'll have more for a SD 10th Anniv. or RAW 20th. (if it happens...)",1054857600,,657,4.559322033898305
1847699,3,B00008HCA0,"The Raw 10th anniversary show had such hype to it that it was inevitable that a let down would happen.  On the Anniversry many of the Awards were silly and political (Best Diva Trish Stratus? BEst Moment the Beer Truck?) I did agree with some (BEst match TLC 4 and Best superstar Stone Cold).  However it is the special features, the stuff not on the show that makes this worth owning.
The problem is that this should of been a 2 DVD set.  What should of been included are matches that were nominated, the momnents in their full glory, and the whole showing of the Raw Debute.  However what is there is entertaining enough.  On the DVD are all the moments nominated, a special on the Divas, the easter eggs being the Raw opening segments, documentary on Raw on the Roof, TLC 4 match, First Raw Main event, and interviews with superstars there.
However despite the goods teh actual event was dissapointing, and to actually influence purchase of this DVD it should of been a 2 DVD set.  Maybe when Smackdown hits 10 years they will do a better job, or if Raw hits 20 years.  The problems do lower this to where only the die hard will own it.",1052179200,,1139,4.395238095238096
7984257,3,B00008HCA0,Not bad. Many were expecting this to be an actual episode of Raw but this in turn was an awards show with a Slammys vibe.

7984264,5,B00008HCA0,"Tenth RAW Anniversary is such an AMAZING DVD! I bought it because of the ""Shut Up & Kiss Me"" Award segment, but I enjoyed it for so much more than that... It stars off as always with a video package of the previous 10 years that RAW had been around at that point. Then we get right in to the 10th Anniversary Spectacular which takes place at The World in New York City.

Chapters:

*Shawn Michaels Presents: RAW Diva of the Decade - With the likes of Sable, The ""Original Diva"" Sunny, Trish Stratus, Lita, and Chyna; the award could have went to any of the 5 of them honestly. But, in the end not surprisingly, Trish Stratus - Mrs. Stratus-faction and Class of 2013 Hall of Famer, wins it!

*RAW Retro Moment #10 - This is Your Life, Rock - 9/27/99 - Excellent moment in RAW's History, with Rock ""Layin' the SmackDown!"" on everyone that walked down that ramp from his Coach to his High School Sweetheart, and the hilariousness of it all, such an EPIC moment that still stands in the Top 10 today!

*Shane McMahon Presents: Don't Try This At Home! - The nominees are - Big Show: Chokeslam to Hell - on 'Taker, Jeff Hardy: Tables, Ladders, & Chairs - On Himself and Others (Kane), Dudley Boyz: Mae Young Takes A Ride - on Mae Young, Kurt Angle: Moonsault off a Cage - on Chris Benoit but technically Himself since Benoit moved! My bets of winning were actually on Jeff Hardy or Dudley Boyz, but Big Show comes up thinking he won, but actually Kurt Angle wins, and it is actually funny because he hugs Big Show but anyways, he then has Team Angle hold up the American Flag while accepting the award!

*Looked Good on Paper - Shows a montage of all of the Failures with character concepts over the years in WWE! Highlights Dink & Doink the Clown, The Goon, Kamala, IRS, Tekno Team 2000, Midget Macho Man, Damien Demento, Gillberg, Man Mountain Rock, ""Real Man's Man"" Steven/William Regal, M.O.M., Abe ""Knuckle Ball"" Schwartz, Salvatore, Papa Shango, Issac Yankem, Aldo Montoya, Max Moon, Rick ""The Model"" Martel, The Blue Meanie, Bertha Faye, Earthquake and Typhoon, Bastion Booger, Repo Man, Gobbledy Gooker, Adam Bomb, Duke ""The Dumpster"" Droeze, Giant Gonzalez, The Bushwhackers, Luna Vachon, Harvey Wippleman, Tatanka, and Mantaur!

*RAW Retro Moment #9 - Stone Cold Steve Austin runs over The Rock's car with a monster truck - 4/19/99 - Another classic & an important moment in the Rock-Austin Feud! Such a waste of a brand new Lincoln Continental!

*Booker T & Goldust Present: Tell Me I Did Not Just See That - Nominees: 3 Faces of Foley - Mankind, Dude Love, and Cactus Jack, Mick & his many personalities; The Hug - Eric Bischoff and Vince McMahon (WCW) & (WWF/E) HUG?!; Brawl 4 All - Not boxing, and Not wrestling; Kane Fire Starter - Kane sets the commentator's booth and a crewman on fire; Zamboni 3:16 - Stone Cold drives a Zamboni in to the arena, and jumps off the top to attack McMahon! Mick Foley wins, but is not present and a lot of people in the crowd are disappointed.

*Ric Flair Presents: Gone But Not Forgotten - The past wrestlers that passed away at this point are highlighted in a video montage - Andre the Giant (Legend), Joey Marella (WWF Referee), Brian Pillman (Wrestling Legend), Rick Rude (Wrestling Legend), Owen Hart (Wrestling Legend), Gorilla Monsoon (Wrestler, Commentator, Legend), Yokozuna (Legend), and The British Bulldog (Legend)! R.I.P. to the GREAT LEGENDS!

*Chirs Jericho Presents: Gimme The Mic - Basically the award for best entertainer on the mic; Nominees: Stone Cold - Gimme a Hellyeah!, DX - Two Words for Ya!, Kurt Angle - It's True! It's True!, Mick Foley - Cheap Pops, Mr. McMahon - Don't Cross the Boss, The Rock - The Rock Says...! Ok, so of course there is a lot of good nominations here, but if anything I knew Angle wouldn't even be close! I personally believe it was between DX, Stone Cold, and The Rock... so all close calls! But, in the end of course The Rock wins, and he even shows up... VIA SATELITE, and makes a couple of jokes about Goldust, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, & my favorite Stephanie McMahon!

*RAW Retro Moment #8 - the last WCW Nitro - 3/26/01 - Ahhh, the victory lap for the WWF, and the surprising buy of WCW, also the start of the EPIC Invasion Angle!

*Taz & Michael Cole Present: Shut Up & Kiss Me - Ahhh, my favorite, and the only reason is because I am a pretty big McMahon-Helmsley Era Fan! My favorite wrestler is Triple H, and I LOVE the McMahons, especially Steph! But anyways, this award is for all the couples over the past decade on RAW! Nominees: Mark Henry & Mae Young - May December Romance, Chyna & Eddie Guerrero - Mamacita!, Lita & Matt Hardy - Team Extreme, Mr. McMahon & William Regal - Kiss My Ass Club, Stephanie McMahon & Triple H - The McMahon-Helmsley Era! Now, the only two that were close enough to wonder who was going to win it were, Lita & Hardy, & Steph & Triple H. It could have been either one honestly! But, in the end Stepanie & H won it, making for a VERY interesting acceptance speech!

*RAW Retro Moment #7 - Bedpan McMahon - 10/5/98 - An EPIC moment in the Austin-McMahon feud, Austin taking the role of the Dr. to attack Vince was brilliant! And as always Foley is entertaining!

*""Mean"" Gene Okerlund & Pat Patterson Present: Network Difficulties - The award for which angle gave the Network the most trouble! Nominations: Mae Young - A Hand is Born, Stone Cold- Santa Stunner, 3 Minute Warning - Hot Lesbian Action, Brian Pillman - Pillman's Got a Gun! I figured that it would be Pillman's Got a Gun since this is the episode that almost got RAW taken off the air, but actually Mae Young wins, and I have to admit that that was disturing!

*RAW Retro Moment #6 - D-Generation-X imitates the Nation of Domination - 7/6/98 - Very entertaining moment for DX. As always DX delivered and was hilarious as ever! Classic RAW moment!

*Brock Lesnar Presents: RAW Superstar of the Decade - The big award of the night! Nominations: ""The Hardcore Legend"" - Mick Foley, ""The People's Champion"" - The Rock, ""Excellence of Execution"" - Bret Hart, ""The Game"" - Triple H, ""The Rattlesnake"" - Stone Cold Steve Austin, ""The Phenom"" - The Undertaker! It was a close call between any of them in my opinion. I mean honestly these 6 superstars were & still are the top in the business, my only add in would be ""The Heartbreak Kid"" - Shawn Michaels! But, in the end Stone Cold won! One of the All-Time Greats ladies & gentelman! And the funny thing is Vince McMahon comes out to accept the award for him, and the fans are not happy that Stone Cold is not there! After that they interview Triple H on why he didn't win the Superstar of the Decade award and then him & Evolution leave because of his bitterness!

*RAW Retro Moment #5 - Austin Confrontation - 1/19/98 - The confronation between Mike Tyson & Austin that led to WrestleMania XIV. This is one of the MAJOR reasons that WCW started to lose the Monday Night Wars!

*King & J.R. Present: RAW's Greatest Match - Nominees - T.L.C. 2002 - Jeff Hardy, Christian, Chris Jericho, Rob Van Dam, Spike Dudley, Kane, Bubba Ray; Triple H vs. Cactus Jack - 1997; Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy - 2002; Stone Cold vs. Kane - 1998! Any one of these could have been the greatest match on RAW, but my pick was for Triple H vs. Cactus Jack. However, that did not happen. The winner was a match that is still considered one of the best to this day, if not the best on RAW - T.L.C. 2002! This is the last award of the night!

*RAW Retro Moment #4 - DX Invades WCW - 4/27/98 - A legendary moment in WWF/E history! It was close to the climax of the Attitude Era, and this moment really put WWE on the map! It made WCW know that WWE was there to win! It helped turn the tides in the war also! I always wondered what would have happened if DX actually had made it in to the building... hmmm?

*RAW Retro Moment #3 - Hollywood Hulk Hogan & The Rock Confrontation - 2/18/02 - Not one of my personal faves, but it was a generation defining moment, the old vs. the new! Out with the old and in with the new as they say. Well, that is just what happened here, when deciding who was the best?!

*RAW Retro Moment #2 - Owen Hart Tribute - 5/24/99 - Such a touching moment. The death of Owen was shocking for everyone involved or there to witness it at all. The superstars showed their true feelings this night, and it is a night that will never be forgotten in the hearts of WWE fans!

*Edge Presents: #1 Greatest Moment in RAW History - Stone Cold Beer Truck - 3/22/99 - This also the #1 moment on the other 2 RAW dvds after this, so that is saying something! An epic moment where 2 of the McMahons and The Rock got EXACTLY what they deserved!

- This was the main feature on the 10th Anniversary DVD, * after the #1 moment, all of the superstars stand up on stage & accept appreciation from the fans!
