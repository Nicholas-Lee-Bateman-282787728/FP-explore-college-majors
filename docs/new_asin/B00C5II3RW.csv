8577427,1,B00C5II3RW,"These 3 films in which the English band Saint Etienne was involved in, features mostly the City of London and its surrounding areas. If you are a SE fan and are looking for some good music, you won't find it here. These are mostly artistic films featuring London and primarily aimed at artsy types and anglophiles, but not for the general public to enjoy. The soundtrack music is exactly what it implies: mood or background music which is not even good enough for a B-side or rare tracks compilations, nevertheless, the ""What Have You Done Today, Mervyn Day"" has a soundtrack album available from Amazon or Saint Etienne's website though Heavenly records.
Still, if you are still curious, search these out on the internet. I'm sure once you see them you'll agree with my review.",1443139200,2,778,4.770370370370371
