1729919,4,B00006952Y,"I nonetheless enjoyed it as a whole, and those not familiar at all with who W.R. Hearst was will hopefully be compelled to do some more digging into the odd fellow. An interesting story...the movie is a fun peek into the semi-decadence of people who have ascended the mountain of success and have nothing to do at the top but be amused and glib about the suffering of others, and play fast and loose with conventional morality, it having no use in such financial stratospheres. And yet, the power serves them insidiously when something truly foul happens-it can be made to disappear in such a way that ordinary folks could not. But this story doesn't have a big fat moral-really, you're watching Joanna Lumley, Edward Herrmann, Eddie Izzard and Kirsten Dunst impress you by filling their characters' shoes effectively, with wit and whimsy amongst the lavish backdrop of Twenties affluence in spite of sobriety. It's worth a look.",1030233600,,929,4.886075949367089
1729920,5,B00006952Y,"While there are many different styles of movies that can entertain, this one is pure pleasure to watch and experience.  It tells us the story of what may have happened aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht in 1924, and shares ""The Whisper Told Most Often.""  Of course it may or may not have happened in this exact manner, but you will lose yourself in the magic of that time in our history.
The acting is superb - all of it.  Herrmann actually becomes W.R. Hearst.  Jennifer Tilly, Eddie Izzard, and Joanna Lumley are perfect.  Kirsten Dunst is absolutely luminous as Marion Davies.  She brings her to life with a vivacity that makes you want to learn more about the real Marion.
As the story unfolds, you will be mesmerized by not only the acting, but the ""to die for"" costumes, the wonderful music and the great sets.  I've seen the movie 3 times and have ordered the DVD.  Can't wait to see it again.  I also have the sountrack - great music.
Do yourself and a friend a favor and see if it you can still find it anywhere.  If not, order the DVD.  You won't be sorry.  I've read far more estatic reviews than unfavorable.  You would have to be a very ""jaded"" person to dislike this movie.",1025481600,13,1191,4.408256880733945

1729994,4,B00006952Y,"It's almost eerie. My father had just died, and I found an old book about Hollywood mysteries while I was boxing up his things. I took a break and thumbed through it. I settled on the story of William Randolph Hearst's doomed yacht excursion, where a man was found fatally shot on board, yet nobody was forthcoming about the details. After reading, I boxed up my father's books and that same weekend, put on the TV while I was wiping shelves. The Cat's Meow was playing! I'd never even heard of this story less than twenty-four hours before and now I'd read the story and the movie was on the very station I'd tuned into! The excesses and silliness of that era are on full display in this film. Edward Herrmann is at his finest as he portrays William Randolph Hearst, the tycoon of a great newspaper dynasty; a man that America, its people and political leaders listened to. (I'd also recommend reading the book by Patty Hearst, William Randolph Hearst's granddaughter.)",1449014400,,970,4.645348837209302

The absence of any mention of this rumor I believe to be the greatest oversight in Attenborough's otherwise flawless film Chaplin, with Robert Downey Junior.
(SPOILER)

1730075,2,B00006952Y,"After finishing The Cats Meow I was glad it was over. I think the director tried to make this film look like it was from the 1920s, but this only resulted in two hours of bad acting and a non-eventful plot. One thing I did like was that when the movie was in present time, the movie was in black and white, which is what a movie in the 1920s would have been shot in. When the character was remembering the events of that weekend the movie would go into color, because it was her memories. Another interesting thing about this movie is that it was based on actual events and actual characters. When researching this movie, I saw pictures of the people the characters were portraying and they looked almost identical. I wouldnt recommend this movie, but someone who likes the roaring twenties might enjoy it. I don't think this movie is good for a high school student who is trying to learn about U.S. History because it doesnt have much background information about what was going on in the world during the time the movie takes place. Therefore, it was hard to learn about U.S. history through this movie.",1415664000,,1105,4.502487562189055

1730171,1,B00006952Y,"For several generations, Citizen Kane (1941) has molded public memory of William Randolph Hearst. For younger film goers, however, another, newer movie, The Cat's Meow (2001), has begun to supplant Citizen Kane in etching Hearst. Citizen Kane at least implied a fictional side by inventing new names for the characters loosely inspired by Hearst and actress Marion Davies. Unlike Citizen Kane, The Cat's Meow makes no concession, offering a panoply of actual historical characters by name, leaving viewers to expect at least a basic reconstruction of events. In truth, The Cat's Meow continues the distortion of Hearst and Davies, but is even more egregiously misleading about the other figures depicted, especially producer Thomas Ince.

On a November weekend in 1924, Ince and Hearst met to finalize plans under discussion for years: producing Hearst's movies at Ince's privately owned studio, one of the finest in Hollywood outside of the majors. Since 1910, as revealed in my Ince biography, he had written, directed, or produced some 800 movies, a prolific output that won him fame but was also resulting in ulcers and angina. Outside of his family, only Ince's closest associates suspected; as an independent in Hollywood, often depending on bank loans, Ince had to conceal his ill-health.

He had a long weekend with little if any sleep. It began at his home with a Saturday visit from Hearst, and a a preview that night of one of Ince's new films to gauge audience response. The next morning Ince traveled to San Diego and boarded Hearst's yacht for negotiations. After snacking on salted almonds, and unwilling not to join in the toasts (despite his doctor's orders to avoid alcohol) for both his own and his son's birthday, Ince was stricken. In the dawn hours, complaining of fatigue and pain from his ulcers, he went ashore and consulted nurses and a doctor. Ince's wife Elinor and eldest son (age 15, and who would take up the practice of medicine as an adult) hastened to Ince's side and brought him home where, despite the attention of his personal physician, a thrombosis ended his life two days later.

The untimely death of a 44 year old Hollywood pioneer is insufficient dramatic premise for The Cat's Meow. Instead of examining his medical record, it amplifies rumors whispered by Hearst's most reckless enemies at the time; Ince had also irked many in the press because he had just produced a cinematic expose of yellow journalism (Her Reputation, 1923). Viewers of The Cat's Meow are shown a libidinous Hearst, jealously believing Davies was involved with Charlie Chaplin, firing a pistol in his rage, yet mistaking the burly Ince for the slight comedian. Supposedly Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons was a witness and so gained her position with his syndicate.

On the other side are the facts. Parsons was in New York at the time, and had already been under contract with Hearst for a year. If Hearst were gunning for Chaplin, it is unlikely they would have remained cordial until the late 1930s, only becoming disaffected as a result of political clashes. The Cat's Meow erases the Chaplin-Ince friendship and Ince's nautical experience; he had loaned his own racing yacht to Chaplin for a honeymoon cruise.

Elinor would hardly have been complacent in the death of the father of her three young boys. She in no way blamed Hearst, and continued to visit San Simeon; the Inces had been frequent guests in earlier years. Nor did she secure Hearst hush money, since she had a million-dollar estate derived from the sale of her husband's studio and corporate assets, and real estate the couple had already bought.

The conspiracy-theorists even suggest that Ince's cremation somehow confirms their beliefs, unaware that the Inces were theosophists, opposed to burial. In fact, the casket was open during the funeral, and body was examined by police with the case was thoroughly investigated both in the journals and by legal authorities at the time, and no grounds for suspicion were found--even from Hearst adversaries.

The slander about Ince's death in The Cat's Meow is exceeded only by the fabrication of his career. Ince himself is shown as a sycophant, enduring peevish insults from near-stranger Hearst, and lucky to make a film a year. In fact, that year, 1924, fifteen Ince feature movies were released to theaters. At the time of his death, he had nine more productions already before the camera, completed in the following months. He was a major, commercial producer, with several ongoing distribution deals to fulfill, and there was every reason for Hearst and Ince to link; they were natural allies as independents against the ongoing consolidation of Hollywood corporations. Not content with falsifying Ince, The Cat's Meow even maligns Elinor, showing her as not joining her stricken husband, and denigrating her active role in the Ince company, publicly and behind the scenes.

The Cat's Meow joins fanciful stories to be found all over the internet about Ince's death, incredible concoctions that invoke every possibility this side of extra-terrestrial intervention--and which share one element in common: not one is sourced in reliable or contemporary accounts. Hearsay is all that is needed. Thanks to Citizen Kane, and later The Cat's Meow, Hearst, Davies, and now Thomas Ince are known more for fiction than history. At least Citizen Kane had the merit of its artistry; The Cat's Meow is simply a tawdry imagining of dissipation, murder and cover-up, and there can be no question how it diverges from the truth. By blighting the memory of filmdom's early titans, The Cat's Meow belittles the cinema's pioneers in fantasizing a scandal in a Hollywood never-never land.",1321142400,11,5712,5.069148936170213

This is one of those flicks where I don't like any of the characters...in fact I loathed most of them...and yet studied it as if preparing for a dissertation on the subject. And though I despise him (both the real-life Hearst and the character based on him in this film), I couldn't help but feel bad for the pathetic scumbag for what he went through with Davies.

1730176,4,B00006952Y,"Peter Bogdanovich's ""The Cat's Meow"" is a picture-perfect, yet fictionalized, account of a little-known 1924 incident aboard a yacht owned by media mogul William R. Hearst. The characters were all real people, although modern audiences may not be familiar with all of their names. Doesn't matter. The story is the thing here, and it's a terrific one, driven by power, love, lust, lies, desperation and duplicity. Edward Herrmann embodies Hearst like a second skin, while Eddie Izzard channels Charlie Chaplin and Jennifer Tilly oozes her way into a delicious portrayal of famed and feared gossip maven Louella Parson. Kirsten Dunst seems just a tad too young and modern for the Marion Davies part, but she gives it her all. Cary Elwes may surprise fans who remember him more for his comedic turn in ""The Princess Bride"" or as the villain in ""Twister.""

In short: full of twists both above and below deck, ""The Cat's Meow"" could leave most viewers with just one complaint -- that it should have been filmed in black and white.",1278979200,,1025,4.890804597701149
1730197,5,B00006952Y,"In ""The Cat's Meow,"" Peter Bogdonovich performs movie magic, recreating the 1920s, when the screens were silent and the stars' lives were private (or, at least, hushed up). His subtle ""color scheme of black and white"" for the luxurious costumes and opulent settings contributes to the illusion, as does the ""tinny"" musical score, which brings us early 20th-century favorites, such as ""Charleston,"" and ""Ain't We Got Fun?"". Al Jolson's rendition of ""Avalon"" allows us viewers to suspend our collective disbelief and embark on the ill-starred voyage of the ""Oneida"" with William Randolph Hearst, Marion Davies, and their elegantly dissolute guests, which (according to this scenario) include a hot-to-trot Charlie Chaplin; sensational novelist, Elinor Glynn; has-been Movie Mogul, William Ince; future poisoned-pen columnist, Louella Parsons, and an assortment of starlets and hangers-on.

As Hearst, Edward Hermann portrays the lonely paranoia of power; and Kirsten Dunst gives us a glimpse of the comedienne that Marion Davies might have been if given the right part. Eddie Izzard depicts Chaplin' self-conscious charm; Joanna Lumley, who narrates the story in the 'voice' of an Elinor Glynn novel, is convincing; and if anyone thinks that Jennifer Tilly's interpretation of Louella Parsons is exaggerated, then they have never heard that redoubtable purveyor of gossip on the radio, as, every week, she literally meowed ""Hello to All of You From Hollywood!"" Bogdonovich has adroitly directed an ensemble cast in which every character is pitch-perfect [The girls playing the starlets are especially commendable.].

The DVD includes extras that are really worth watching. Students of film will appreciate the ""Anatomy of a Scene,"" which, as the name implies, takes the main scene apart and puts it together again, demonstrating the director and actors at work. The extras include and interesting account of the perils of filming ""California"" in Greece in November; and a Charlie Chaplin longish ""short,"" which is laugh-out-loud funny!

Part Agatha Christie mystery and part Hollywood thriller, ""The Cat's Meow"" is a keeper, which I take off the shelf every year and watch again, always discovering some new detail, to my great enjoyment.",1259539200,,2236,5.475362318840579

The movie takes place on board William Randolph Hearst's large yacht, which is peopled with Hollywood personalities from the early thirties.  Certainly this alone will appeal to nostalgia fans.  The surprise really is that the whole thing is done so well, even to the impromptu Charleston dances, the sly drinks on a ""dry"" ship, and the petty liaisons so typical of the people and times.

This inventive story/script that was cleverly based on Hollywood myth/legend of a presumed love affair Charlie Chaplin had with William Randolph Heart's mistress, Marion Davies and had my interest fully. I was happy with the performances - namely Eddie Izzard as the dashing and flamboyant Chaplin - and worthy direction but was hoping there could have been shots other than on the yacht...i.e. at the studio or the castle/ranch; that would have been a real treat. But for the twist they presented, I guess it served it's purpose - hence the title of course. A terrible habit I got into during the film was comparing it similarities to Robert Altman of how uses a numerous characters and intertwining story-lines yet at times can lead to disarray and inconsistencies (i.e. 'Ready to Wear', Shortcuts') while Bogdonovich's surpasses the challenge of an ensemble cast to generate and substantiate both the scene to scene intrigue and well-performed drama as well as focusing of the proposed love triangle.

1730205,4,B00006952Y,The fact that Peter Bogdanovich has made an intriguing film here is no small feat.  He faces many obstacles in tackling this project.  For starters it's based on a play so he has to avoid staginess.  The action takes place on a luxury yacht yet the film doesn't feel claustrophobic.  It's also a period piece but it doesn't feel like a museum piece.  Many people have dismissed Bogdanovich as a has-been but you wouldn't know it here.  There are enough artistic fluorishes on display here that suggest his earlier work.  The film also is graced with an excellent cast.  Noteworthy is a touching performance by Edward Herrmann as William Randolph Hearst and a spunky turn by Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies.  I didn't buy Eddie Izzard as Charlie Chaplin but that is based more on his physical bearing than anything inherent in his performance.  Izzard is a terrific actor and I was fortunate to have seen him on stage in London in 1999 playing Lenny Bruce.,1155772800,2,954,4.692771084337349

1730226,4,B00006952Y,"At the very minimum, at least you know you will get a minimally interesting film from Peter Bogdanovich. Paper Moon and The Last Picture Show are classics of modern movie making. While a departure from those two movies in style, this film is comparable in that it tells an interesting story, weaves a compelling narrative through the character interactions, and when the movie ends, the viewer gets the feeling the story is far from over.

A lot of criticisms have been levied at the casting, which I did not have a problem with. Are reviewers so jaded they only find beautiful, charming characters believable? In real life, there are many pretty young women who fall in love with older, physically unappealing men. In that sense, the attraction between the two is very believable; so believable, most viewers probably will not even give it a second thought (except for those who believe physical attraction is the only basis for why people fall in love).

Bottom line: a decent film worth seeing. It won't change your life like Bogdanovich's other two classics, but is worth seeing.",1132444800,6,1083,4.880434782608695
1730227,1,B00006952Y,"I got to agree with the other reviewer here who said this is a bottom of the barrel affair. And it is indeed with negligible redeeming points about it.

First of all its the cast, it doens't work, and you find one miscast after the other. Eddie Izzard as Chaplin is horrible, bland, completely forgetfull. The fact that a person with the physique of Izzard, short, bulky and ugly can aspire romantic love to a young Kirsten Dunst is completely unbelievable, the scenes with the two together are verging to the physically disgusting. Granted, Chaplin was no Carry Grant but you have to find some alluring physical qualities to someone you are going to cast opposite youthfull Kirsten to make this believable. The script doesn't help Eddie Izzard, as Chaplin gains no ground in wittyness that could make up for his physical appearance, going with very few and unimportant lines during the film. Eddie's lack of training as a classical actor is also very obvious and very pronounced in such a miscast role, and with so bad a material script wise.

On the other hand Johanna Lumley does salvage a good performance. As does Kirsten Dunst, who again is miscast here, as what should have been the sultry mistress of Hirst. You can tell she's trying hard to make this work, and i can't deny her talent, but neither co-actors, script or directorship are of any help here. She's also a very bad pairing with the Hearst character.

The cast being so off, luckily for the screen writer, who does a sub par job translating his play into film. If you go over the movie you won't find one memorable line, worse than tv material all around. Is these people are supposed to be devious, faul mouthed, gossipy, influential how come they are portrayed in such a boring, dull way. And besides being off the mark with the characters (Why instead of Hearst the tough mogul do we get a soft, almost pathetic, parody...) the plot goes absolutely nowhere. There's the main movement of Charlie's love affair with Heart's girlfriend and nothing else going on around, just filler, filler, filler. You d expect if not a sub plot, some losely knit stories around the main characters instead of this disjointed, pointless mess. Which, again, would have been excused had the love affair at center stage been at all juice, but the treatmeant  it gets here by Peros is beginners guide to script writing type. And Eddie and Kirsten are not what you d call a match made in heaven to lift this up (from below zero) to something decent, on the contrary.

At the beggining Tilly is walking along Charlie at the port, chattering to him, this is an external shot, and the (unintentional) wind is blowing on and off the rim of Tilly's hat so much that it's ludicrous, she says something then bang the hats on her face and you can't see her, then in the middle of the next sentence the hat with its dangling strings is up again, and then slap back on her face. This is pityful...

Another scene I liked was where Izzard is gossiping with Lumley if you look in the background of the frame, on the top corner you ll notice a fire alarm system of the refurbished ship the film people are using to shoot. No one's noticed this to tell them how bad it looks obviously and that they had to do something about it. Which kinda sums up this awful film.

Avoid it, or watch it to get a taste of how bad things can go.",1131148800,2,3363,4.530477759472817

I think Kirsten Dunst did a great job playing Marion Davies, despite the fact that Dunst was much younger than the character was in the movie.  Eddie Izzard did a great job as Charlie Chaplin, playing Chaplin as a real person and not as a ""Little Tramp"" caricature.  Joanna Lumley as the eccentric Elinor Glyn is my personal favorite in the movie... her telling the others of the ""California Curse"" in one scene was fascinating, and her narration of the beginning and end of the movie was perfectly done.

The story is one of Hollywood legend, told in whispers, and it's great that the story is alive again thanks to this great movie.  I highly recommend it, and at its low price, it's a pretty good deal.

Personally I like the Signature Series cover art more, because it adds a touch of class to a very classy and well-done movie.

I've always enjoyed this movie because of my fascination with old-time Hollywood.  The movie has an excellent cast (especially Joanna Lumley as the eccentric Elinor Glyn).

1730231,3,B00006952Y,"The Cat's Meow offers an insight into what may (or may not) have occurred during a fateful pleasure cruise aboard media mogul William Randolph Hearst's yacht in 1924.  One guest didn't survive the trip, and afterwards the other passengers only ever talked about what happened during those few days in riddles. The film is at pains to point out that it only depicts one possible version of events, which unfortunately does rather undermine the convincing storyline.

The story begins in Hollywood, ""a land just off the coast of the planet earth"", in that decadent decade dominated by the Charleston, flappers, and bootleg moonshine.  The women's costumes are thus visually spectacular - all satin and feathers - but some of the actors seem to be overwhelmed by the splendour, and appear somewhat wooden as a result.  The notable exception to this is Kirsten Dunst, who plays the effervescent Marion Davies, Hearst's mistress.  However, the best lines in the film surely belong to the wonderfully cynical and sarcastic Joanna Lumley.

The thing the movie does capture to perfection is the double standards extant in Hollywood.  One of the characters disdainfully dismisses the Prohibition, claiming that alcohol isn't illegal ""for us"".  And that seems to pretty much sum up the attitude of the film fraternity at the time - that they are above rules and regulations.  Even murder, it would seem, can be hushed up.

This isn't a murder mystery as such; anyone with a thorough knowledge of Hollywood history will know who died, and the whispers surrounding the event.  But the average viewer may question if, after all this time, they really care what the truth is.  Better instead to enjoy this film as a fiction.",1105488000,,1710,4.982394366197183
1730232,3,B00006952Y,"Anyone who has taken an introductory film class knows Thomas Ince was a pioneer filmmaker who could never live out of the shadow of D.W. Griffith. Part of this has to do with talent and the other part with his fast lifestyle. This film barely touches on either aspect, but it does venture forth a theory on how he died in November 1924. One-time wunderkind director Peter Bogdanovich has made an intriguing historical fiction by surrounding Ince with a gallery of larger-than-life characters aboard publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst's yacht. The occasion is Ince's birthday party, and the story ends with his death. How his death occurred is a matter of speculation, but Bogdanovich, along with screenwriter Steve Peros, has fashioned a period murder mystery focused on the volatile love triangle of Hearst, his mistress Marion Davies and Charlie Chaplin. According to this version, Chaplin is constantly on the make for the alluring Davies, and Ince is more than willing to spy on them for Hearst so that the mogul will fund his failing movie-producing career. Chaplin finally makes his conquest after a huge drug-and-sex orgy, Hearst finds out and then a series of tragic consequences occur.

At first, Kirsten Dunst seems an odd choice for the vivacious Davies, as the actress is too young to be a credible magnet for two such powerful men (though ironically, Chaplin preferred the company of much younger women). But she actually grows in the film until she finally captures the world-weariness of her character in the final scenes. Edward Herrmann plays Hearst like he played FDR, full of bombast but this time, with a decided sadness and made all the more pathetic by the vast age difference between his character and Davies. British comedian Eddie Izzard makes a credible Chaplin, though he seems relatively constrained by the role, as does Cary Elwes who plays Ince with just enough desperation to make his fate seem less than criminal. Out of  ""Ab Fab"" mode, Joanna Lumley is quite effective as writer Elinor Glyn, who narrates the story, but Jennifer Tilly is grating as the clinging gossip columnist Louella Parsons, the only one to benefit from the scandal and become a Hollywood power doyenne for thirty years. It's an interesting story told competently but not all that memorably, but this one is definitely up Bogdanovich's alley as he enjoys Hollywood history like no other filmmaker.",1103846400,5,2407,5.030075187969925

We'll never truly know, but the film is a peppy cavalcade of big name stars playing big name stars. It's a character-heavy motion picture so let's discuss the impersonations.

Dunst is the flavour of the month, she makes Davies look like an attractively complex figure. While reflecting the verve of a young privileged woman at an exciting time, she maintains a moral core without really being certain of precisely what she wants, which rings true.

The flamboyant Eddie Izzard was a surprise in the cast but made an atypically understated Chaplin. You see the intelligence and yearning in his eyes, the sly wit dripping from his casual tilts of the head.

Personally, I felt these two were the only admirable actors in the film. The rest of the crew members acted as though they were in a much dopier movie. Herrmann for instance plays Hearst, the big tycoon, as a buffoon channeled through Bill Murray, huffing and puffing when he feels betrayed, grinning goofily and almost cross-eyed when he appears giddy.

The film overall is a very watchable one though, particularly if you can overlook a needlessly sepia tone across the board giving a pseudo-noir look. The idea clearly was less to weave a murder mystery yarn and more to splice together the interactions among people at the scene of a high-society and thus hush-hush crime.",1096502400,14,1490,4.873517786561265
1730234,4,B00006952Y,"Cat's Meow is based on events that took place one November weekend in 1924 when the financial mogul William Randolph Hearst (Edward Herrmann) invited a group of celebrities to his yacht.  The occasion was to celebrate the birthday of the film producer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes).  Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard) was also among the invitees.  There were also some rumors prior to the trip that Chaplin fancied the actress Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst) who was Hearst's beloved girlfriend.  The birthday cruise became an envious love triangle which has death as its destination.

Peter Bogdanovich tells this particular Hollywood scandal in a convincing manner as the story is focused on the love triangle between Hearst, Davies, and Chaplin.  The other characters add a lot of intrigue and color to the film as they all have their own motives for being on the yacht.  The cast performances are solid and the mise-en-scene elevates the cinematic experience.  However, the film never reaches it full potential as similar stories have done in the past where a murder is committed in a remote location.

1730254,4,B00006952Y,"The Cat's Meow is a delightfully entertaining film, set in 1934 on the cruise ship Oneida.  The events that took place on board that boat were never actually discovered.  This film entertains one of the many theories of how the events transpired that weekend.  It's the 43rd birthday of film director and producer Thomas Ince, played nicely by Cary Elwes.  Mr. Ince's friend Marion Davies is throwing him a birthday party on board the yacht Oneida which is owned by her lover William Randolph Hearst.  Marion's guest list also included her friend and part-time fling, actor and comedian Charlie Chaplin.  Hearst is very possessive of Marion and he is not fond of the relationship that her and Mr. Chaplin share.  The other guests include Elinor Glyn who was an extremely famous romance novelist, Louella 'Lolly' Parsons a well known up and coming Hollywood gossip columnist, and Ms. Margaret Livingston a not so well known actress who was also Ince's mistress.  Now I know what you are thinking all the wrong people are in all the right places for the sparks to begin flying and fly they do.
 Though many of us would not have picked such an unknown actor such as Eddie Izzard to portray Charlie Chaplin the results support themselves.  In this more serious portrayal of Chaplin, Eddie Izzard did spectacular.  Kirsten Dunst plays Marion Davies quite remarkably I must say the on screen chemistry that Dunst and Izzard share is shockingly realistic.  The largest downfall for this film would have to be the chemistry between Marion Davies and her lover William Randolph Hearst, or should I say the lack of.  Edward Herrmann who portrayed Hearst did wonderful in his own right but the scenes that he and Dunst shared, suspended believability farther than I am willing to allow.  There just seamed to be no connection between the two, even though in real life Marion Davies stayed by William Randolph Hearst until his death nearly thirty years later.  I just felt that when portraying real people it is quite important to display the connection that they shared, you know for history's' sake and for my own as a viewer.
 Alright lets get back to the good stuff.  In my opinion the best part about this film has to be the roles portrayed by Joanne Lumley and Jennifer Tilly.  Jennifer Tilly plays gossip columnist Lolly Parsons.  Jennifer Tilly is such a delight to watch on screen, she has that presence that makes everyone want to giggle the first time that she appears on camera.  Her role is quite different from many of her films that she has been in, but she still pulls the role off nicely.  My favorite part of the film would have to be Joanne Lumley many of you may not recognize her but she has been around.  She plays Patsy on the BBC program Absolutely Fabulous.  Joanne plays novelist Elinor Glyn who in the film is the woman who tells it like it is.  Elinor has a witty comment or comeback for everyone.  Lets just say that Elinor has a way with words, hence her novelist status.  Joanne Lumley is perfect for the role, she fits in so nicely that I don't think I could even picture someone else playing Elinor Glyn.  Joanne's performance is spectacular, she is a great actress.  Peter Bogdonovich did a good job, I especially liked the color changes from full color to black and white and back again they really enhanced the story.  Overall the film is well worth watching and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys film as much as I do or anyone that is interested in possible scenarios in history.",1078444800,6,3523,4.682926829268292
1730255,3,B00006952Y,"""The Cat's Meow"" is purely imaginary accounts on what really happened on the ship owned by William Randolph Hearst, powerful newspaper mogul (now mostly remembered as the inspiration of Orson Wells' ""Citizen Kane"").  Don't expect Agatha Cristie-like mystry, though -- the film is about these characters in the lavish party held on the ship, and director Peter Bogdanovich is more interested in the frivolous atmosphere of the time than in the plot.
In was in November, 1924, in the middle of the Jazz Age.  Hollywood celebrities arrive at Hearst's ship to have a good time.  They are -- Charles Chaplin, Marion Davies (actress and Hearst's mistress), Thomas Ince (movie producer who desperately needs jobs), Elinor Glyn (bestselling author, and best known for writing Clara Bow film ""It""), Louella Parsons (later known as the 'writer' for Hearst's paper), and Margaret Livingston (actress and Ince's mistress).  But before the ship arrives at San Diego, something terrible happened (so the film claims) to one of them.
""The Cat's Meow"" is fictional accounts of the 'scandal,' but its own version of the story is, I am afraid, too incredible.  Moreover, in order to fully enjoy the film, you have to know some historical backgrounds about these people, and that is not appealing to general audience.  (You also remember that director Bogdanovich's career started as a film critic.)  The romantic part of the story, or the entangled relations between Hearst, Chaplin, and Davies, is interesting, but the rest of the characters seems practically left out in the story.
I love Kirsten Dunst who plays Marion Davies, but here it is a trouble to me.  The real Marion Davies was about 27 years old then, and Kirstin Dunst does NOT look like a 27-year-old woman.  She is brilliant in modern setting (see ""Bring it on,"" ""Spider-Man"" and even ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""), but she now looks quite uncomfortable.  Put Edward Herrmann (as Hearst) beside her, and he looks more like a grandfather to her.  Sorry to say this, but Ashley Judd or Charlize Theron would be much more convincing Marion.
The film's best (and most surprising) role is Eddie Izzard as Chaplin.  The casting was a gamble for the director, but it works.  He is a great comic, as you know, but now he gives emotional depth to Chaplin who is clearly in trouble (he was then soon to be married second time).  Robert Downey Jr, did Chaplin once (and he was great, too), but Eddie Izzzard's portait is more realistic when he describes the pains of the man.
The film's greatest virtue is probably its beautiful photography and gorgeous costumes.  The crew did a great job, the photographer Bruno Delbonnel (""Amelie"") in particular.  Its happy-go-easy jazz music is fun to hear, the riduculously fluffy hats are fun to see, and the witty dialogues are also going to make you grin.
Probably, Peter Bogdanovich was too meticulous in re-creating the atmosphere of the age (even Chaplin's Japanese driver Takano is not forgotten).  But I need the central story which has the power to draw us into the world he shows.  It's all jazz, I know, and it's fun to see, but there should be more to it.
Some of the characters are also the subject of another film ""RKO 281 -- The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" starring John Malkovich.  Just in case if you're interested in film history.",1074643200,13,3314,4.875222816399287

None of the passengers on the boat were willing to concede any details, in fact, stories from the different passengers conflicted greatly.
The trip is really a pleasure cruise for Hearst (played very well by Edward Herrmann), Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst), and a few of Hollywood's elite.  The main focus for the group is trying to keep up with the seemingly imminent love affair between Davies and the devilish Charlie Chaplin (wickedly played by Eddie Izzard)  Chaplin has just gotten his 16 year old co star pregnant and now has designs on Davies.  She resists for a while, but eventually falls prey to his charms.
The film is an interesting character study.  Herrmann shows us a Hearst who despite his riches, realizes that he is much older and less attractive than the wolves who are pursuing his girl.  One particularly sad scene is when the band strikes up the Charleston, and Hearst is able to participate only for a few seconds before sitting the rest out.  He watches as Marion has a blast with Charlie and the others on the floor.
Ince(played by Cary Elwes) spends the movie hooking up with his mistress and trying to gain information about other people to benefit himself.  He was a powerful name in the movies at one time, and now is trying to get back to where he was.  He snoops in rooms looking for information, and when he has put the pieces together, disaster strikes in the form of a gun shot.
What is interesting is Hearst's reaction to the shooting of Ince.  Immediately this man who has spent the movie looking weak and helpless springs into action with a pack of lies, trying to cover up what has happened, even calling Ince's wife and making up a despicable story.  We will never know the truth, but this is not only a credible guess at the events, but also a very good film which shows us a different angle of the characters involved.",1068854400,11,2031,4.549450549450549

kirstin dunst portrays perfectly the care-free actress marion davies. she could've taken home a statue for her role in this. edward herrmann is a great WRH........mr. izzard issues a smart charlie chaplin.....carey elwes-all excellent, right on down to the 2nd tier players and bit parts.
this movie makes me feel good about the director peter B.
something similar to david lynch with his excellent mulholland drive which burst forth from the sleeping giant like a fresh daisy-i'm sure Peter is very proud of this little gem.
must make mention of the exciting bonus's on the dvd. interviews, featurette, a chaplin short, making of.........many goodies and juicy treats for the cat's meow.",1067385600,,805,5.014925373134329
1730258,4,B00006952Y,"I saw this movie knowing only of Charlie Chaplin in the beginning of my old movie days. I like Kirsten Dunst and Cary Elwes. After seeing it, I was entertained by the Charleston scenes and not much else. Then, as I began to get more and more interested in the time period, I realized what an excellent movie this is. The story is very much like an old movie so it suits the time period in that way. It also was costumed brilliantly and cast well. Eddie Izzard might not look like Chaplin, but he plays him as if he knew the man. Some of the things in the movie that are mentioned are about things going on at the time period, like the fact that Chaplin got his young co-star of The Gold Rush (Lita Grey) pregnant. He eventually married her.

The extra features are great. The restored Chaplin short is funny and appropriate to the DVD. The interviews with the stars of the movie show that they thought about their characters. I love that Kirsten Dunst decided not to (falsely) portray Marion Davies as she was in Citizen Kane. I wouldn't have known about Marion if it weren't for this movie and the same goes for Thomas Ince. It is a great example of the efforts of wonderful people trying to revive a beautiful time period that will possibly be lost to the world.",1065312000,3,1264,4.3559322033898304
1730259,1,B00006952Y,"What a blatant piece of garbage. As an avid moviegoer, I am always fond of movies that attempt to give life to mysterious events, but it seems that, despite what the ""Amazon.com's Description"" might say about this movie, it truely is *not* a mystery. Not when the victim of the murder is killed in the last 5 minutes of the movie. What you do get with this is about an hour and a half of nonesense, lacking any sort of structure or climax. The script is horrible, and wastes the talents of many of the cast. While the cast members do try to put up a good act, it can't give life to a script that is obviously without structure. When I rented this movie, it was brand new and there was only one copy at a rather large Blockbuster. There's reason for that. In fact, I don't think even the one should have been there. So if you're looking for a night of intrigue, romance, mystery and suspense, don't look towards the Cat's Meow.",1057363200,4,926,4.297142857142857
1730260,3,B00006952Y,"The latest feature from film maker/critic Peter Bogdanovich is a speculative account of events leading to murder that took place on the yacht of media giant William Randolph Hearst (played by Edward Herrmann) on the night of Sat Nov 15 1924.(Great, now I sound like a court reporter).
Among the famous passengers and possible suspects were Hearst's mistress, actress Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst), Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard) on the brink of his next big success THE GOLD RUSH, film pioneer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes), gossip columnist Louella Parsons (Jennifer Tilly) and writer Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley). Bogdanovich and writer Steve Pero, who  scripted from his play have crafted an entertaining ensemble piece/ mystery which somehow manages to avoid falling into the conspiracy theory trap. Add to this lavish production design and good performances all round, especially by Dunst and you have the best Agatha Christie story that Agatha Christie never wrote. You keep expecting Peter Ustinov to show up at some point. Sure, there are the expected love triangles, deep dark secrets and red herrings abound but that doesn't stop THE CAT'S MEOW from being entertaining, despite there being no consistent story of the facts existing. Entertaining, but not special. But with a cast like that, THE CAT'S MEOW is still worth a look.
DVD extras include a director's commentary, making of feature, a Chaplin short film, newsreel footage, interviews with Bogdanovich and the cast and the movie's trailer.",1052092800,2,1501,5.2803347280334725
1730261,5,B00006952Y,"I loved this movie the first time that I viewed it on television. As has been mentioned here in previous reviews, the plot is derived from the infamous and mysterious incident that occurred upon a yacht owned by Randolf Hearst in 1924.  The movie especially draws it's strength from the ensemble cast, powerful performances and intriguing charector insight.  Also, the experience is made more than complete by the wonderful set design and costumes.  I knew what I was getting when I ordered the DVD.
What was unexpected and a delightful surprise was the special features on this DVD.  Several special features include an excellent Charlie Chaplin movie short, a Sundance Film feature entitled Anatomy of a Scene, and a very informative featurette about the making of The Cat's Meow.  All of these special features were very entertaining and enlightening.  Watching them heightened my appreciation for the movie.

1730264,4,B00006952Y,"""Whodunnit?"" This movie tries to answer that -- in 1924, a star-studded boat trip went wrong when someone got shot, and the truth of it was never investigated. This is one thing that might have happened. The actors appear to be enjoying themselves romping through Roaring 20s decadence, but rise to the occasion when genuine acting is called for. It's like an Agatha Christie murder mystery, except no Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot.
A bunch of Hollywood glitterati arrive at a boat belonging to William Randolph Hearst, a rather obnoxious Hollywood mogul. Also on the boat is Marion Davies, Hearst's actress mistress, who is being actively pursued by Charlie Chaplin (who recently got his sixteen-year-old costar pregnant), a cool-and-calm eccentric novelist Elinor Glyn, irritating columnist Louella Parsons, fading superproducer Thomas Ince and his frustrated girlfriend, and a slew of others. Rumors fly about Marion and Charlie's suspected affair, and though Hearst doesn't want to believe it, the clues pile up -- with the assistance of Ince, who wants Hearst to be his business partner. A single gunshot threatens all of them...
This is one of the movies that probably won't appeal to the average viewer, simply because a lot of the people in it, with a few exceptions like Chaplin and Davies, are not now remembered clearly. But if viewers can shut off their ""hey, I don't know who that was"" signals, then they will find a sort of whodunnit without the detective, a juicy soap wrapped up in a mystery wrapped up in a ""Hollywood what-if"" tale. Perhaps the biggest problem is that the last part is a bit anticlimactic and the buildup is rather insubstantial -- the biggest buildup is Hearst tearing through the boat in search of Chaplin.
Kirsten Dunst shines brightly as Marion Davies, showing both a deeply conflicted young woman and a flirty party girl. She's never been better, even if she does wear a giant butterfly on her head. (Weird headpieces are a constant in this movie -- watch for Tilly's birdcage) Cary Elwes of ""Princess Bride"" returns as a desperate man who will go the extra mile to revive his career. Edward Herrmann plays a very intriguing Hearst, who is both obnoxious and tender, jealous and angry, controlling and generous. Eddie Izzard plays an insincere predator as Chaplin, who cares more about the conquest than about the woman; Joanna Lumley is rather underused, but she imbues all her scenes with a hilarious dry wit; Jennifer Tilly plays an irritating flibbertigibbet who has an unexpected cunning streak.
The dialogue is fast, dry and enjoyable -- one of my favorite lines was ""Hollywood, a land just off the coast of the planet Earth."" There's some sexual content (nothing too graphic) and a fair amount of profanity; teens who like Kirsten Dunst particularly will enjoy this, but younger kids will be bored silly.
This is not the movie that will appeal to the bubble-brained. But anyone who likes witty dialogue, sparkling costumes, a well-thought-out plotline and the shivering thrill of wondering if this was how it happened will think ""Cat's Meow"" is the cat's pajamas.",1038009600,42,3109,4.992292870905588
1730265,3,B00006952Y,"This is a diverting movie, but a disappointment nonetheless.  The acting was just fine, especially Kirsten Dunst, who is quite three-dimensional as the surprisingly strong and willfully charming actress Marion Davies who was Wm. Randolph Hearst's mistress.  The rest of the cast is fine, too, except for the horribly annoying Jennifer Tilly as Louella Parsons. (Time for Ms. Tilly's gold watch.  Enough's enough.)  The sets, the look--all of that was done with a fine devotion to period accuracy and style.  Music, too.  So it's well-done.  But the script misfires in a few areas.  Its depiction of Hearst is as mean-spirited in its own way as Orson Welles', but far less compelling as it portrays Hearst as a helpless, paranoid buffoon, which he most assuredly was not.  The man Davies describes to other characters is a far more interesting character than the man you see.  Chaplin's ardor is not particularly believable, but other characters seem to believe it despite evidence to the contrary.  Ditto Thomas Ince's role as a movie mogul.  He's so weak, dumb and whiny, you can't imagine that he ever scaled the heights from which he is now tumbling.  So, in the end, I think it's worth seeing, but I really was hoping for something much better.",1037923200,,1248,4.913875598086125
1730266,5,B00006952Y,"Let me start by saying that I very rarely give a movie five stars. This movie is one of those notable exceptions.
The Cat's Meow is one of those movies that didn't get nearly as much recognition as it should have. Peter Bogdanovich's directing is beautifully understated, as is the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel (Amelie). The script is fabulous, the art direction is flawless, and the acting is, without exception, wonderful.
Kirsten Dunst shows her capacity to play more than the brainless cheerleader in this movie -- her down-to-earth nature enhances Marion Davies' obvious internal struggle. Edward Herrmann is incredible as William Randolph Hearst. He brings a touching level of humanity to a character who is truly unlikable. Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Tilly as Elinor Glyn and Louella Parsons, respectively, play off each other perfectly. Lumley is witty and sophisticated, while Tilly is bright-eyed and annoying. In a good way. Cary Elwes, to whom I have a particular emotional attachment because of Robin Hood: Men In Tights and The Princess Bride, plays a man whose dignity is slowly crumbling away. His performance, like those of the rest of the cast, shows Thomas Ince to be a character who is far from a good person. But you can understand why.
Although the entire ensemble cast delivers thoroughly satisfying performances, one stands out: Eddie Izzard. I have been a fan of his stand-up for many years (and for those of you who haven't seen or heard it, do so immediately), however, when I heard he was playing Charlie Chaplin, I really couldn't envision it. He doesn't look anything like Chaplin, who was slight, in his facial features as well as his physique. Within five minutes of the movie, I had totally forgotten that this was a transvestite stand-up comic who rattles on about everything from evil ducks to Star Trek. The twinkle in Izzard's eye carries over perfectly to Chaplin, the epitome of playfulness. He captures Chaplin's personality and makes it his own so much that after watching the movie, you will have a hard time believing that Chaplin is Chaplin.",1037404800,11,2090,4.991404011461318
1730267,5,B00006952Y,"Film historian and movie director Peter Bogdanovich has crafted an instant classic from an obscure play to produce 2001's ""The Cat's Meow"". Charlie Chaplin, William Randolph Hearst, and his mistress Marion Davies(almost unknown today) are the characters boarding Hearst's yacht Oneida for a fateful 1924 cruise. Fading movie producer Thomas Ince tags along to entice Hearst to bank-roll his sagging career. More than Ince's career is about to go underwater. ""The Cat's Meow"" surrounds real people and probable events, with wild parties, grand dinners, and a clandestine murder on the menu. Bogdanovich is picture-perfect, lovingly recreating a 1920's Hollywood scandal that is still unsolved. Kirsten Dunst is magnetic as Davies, but it's Jennifer Tilly who steals the show as bouncy, clueless Louella Parsons. This new DVD features a trailer, a Chaplin short, and commentary by world-weary Bogdanovich. Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino appear in an actual Hollywood news-reel.  As history has noted, the Hollywood legacy is shrouded in decline. Sadly, the quality of this news-reel has suffered the same fate.",1034640000,8,1115,5.5588235294117645
1730268,3,B00006952Y,"While Kirsten Dunst and Edward Herrmann both give fine performances, this movie is essentially just a fluffy (and historically inaccurate) costume drama.  There is little evidence to support this interpretation of the events that took place on Hearst's yacht that weekend, and plenty to contradict it -- e.g. the fact that Hearst and Chaplin remained friends for years afterward. And, while Kirsten Dunst is fun to watch, she's way to young to play the part of Marion Davies at that time.  Also, too much of the dialog seems ""scripted"" -- like people reciting clever lines, rather than like real conversations.

Come on, what parents would think of bringing their young kids to the theater for this movie? Given the inherent mature theme (sexuality and violence involved) why not take the liberty to make a more realistic and convincing R-rated film?

Nobody really knows what happened on that yachting trip in 1924, but the Hearst we see in this movie exhibits the grandiosity and attempts to control the world that the historical ""WR"" was known for. It also reveals the underbelly most psychohistorians imagine they see in ""great"" men and women.
Bogdonavitch seduces corruption from all his actors in this movie. We see infidelity and double infidelity, greed, schemes, and debauchery from the inside. As the plot slowly builds, one feels compelled to shower, to wash their psychic hands of the basest human nature being dregged across the screen.
Slow for an action movie, too obvious for a whodunnit, unsubstantiated enough to fail at history, this film becomes a vehicle for painting an unflattering portrait of the Hollywood bourgeousie. Power and insecurity, scheming and downfall, betrayal and betrayal. Five stars worth.

Told as a possible story as what might have happened to Thomas Ince one fateful night on Hearst's boat, we see a deeper story about morality and power during the Hearst and Davies years.
Dunst is absolutely terrific as Marion Davies - an actress whose own talents were equally electrifying on screen if given the proper vehicle.  Unfortunately for Davies, Hearst didn't see her as a comedianne and some of this struggle comes across in the film.  Also worth seeing in these rolls is the befuddled Jennifer Tilly as Louella Parsons and Eddie Izzard as the amorous (or heartbreakingly lecherous) Charlie Chaplin.",1031616000,,845,4.854166666666667

It follows this group of starlets and directors and writers as they take a weekend cruise on William Randolph Hearsts Yacht.  It gives the viewer one man's vision of how life for extremely wealthy people goes during the early 1920's.  I won't put in a spoiler.  There's a murder.  It surprises everyone.  There is quite a bit of extra-marital sex going on and being discussed.  There is really great music from the era.  The reason I rate it as highly as I do is due to the script and directing.  I thought it was a smart script and Bogdonavich did a good job getting such a large group of actors to tell a story in a coordinated way that makes sense, has tension and makes the viewer think about those characters that are featured.  The last 3 or 4 lines of the movie are especially incisive.  I loved the movie.  I know people who would get bored with it because of the amount of detail, and the tempo of the movie.  I recommend it.  The movie is entertaining, and it asks the viewer to look past the superficial lives of most of these characters and see the helpless and existential nature of the life these characters are living.
