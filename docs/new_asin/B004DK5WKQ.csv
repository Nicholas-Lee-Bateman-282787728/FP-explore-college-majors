Wealthy Polly Fulton marries a progressive scholar whose attitudes toward capitalism and acquired wealth puts their marriage in jeopardy, but turns out fine!",1382745600,9,225,5.457142857142857
8425500,5,B004DK5WKQ,"This story is moving, endearing, elegant and at times, cute. It gives an honest, at times, harsh look at the ways world war ii reinforced class tensions, srained or deepened marriages and forced or enabled people to realize other people's lives beyond their own. Stanwyck and Hefflin are first-rate actors because they give their characters warmth and grace but also at times, a cold stark reallism. One of those movies I suspect made a lot of housewives tear up in their seats before going back home yo their husbands and all their worries. I love so many 40s films because they're both world weary and innocent. Old film lovers will appreciate a movie like this.",1370649600,16,664,4.782608695652174
