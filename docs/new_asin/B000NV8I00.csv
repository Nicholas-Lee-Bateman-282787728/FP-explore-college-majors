 His explanation of the subject is easy to follow and fun every step of the way.  With cool art and effects what's not to like about this dvd? It's gauranteed to add more invaluable skills to your belt if you are in this field of work, which I would hardly call it work because I believe if you love what you do then it is no longer work, right?
 Anyway I give it 5 Stars. I liked it, here's another favorite that's part of my growing collection.",1211846400,3,664,4.238095238095238
