6271034,2,B00IKM5LT0,"clive owen is miscast as a 1950's type gangster.  he is just not credible in such a role.  not sure what director, writer and producer were thinking.",1396137600,,149,4.481481481481482

6271037,2,B00IKM5LT0,Boring and with such great talent you would think they could keep the accents at bay (Marion and Clive). Can I have my money back?,1395792000,,130,4.24
6271038,3,B00IKM5LT0,"It's a little overwrought and there are unexplained gaps in the characters' motivations.  However, if you're a Clive Owen fan, he draws on his emotional intensity and uses expressions in new ways.  The ending is shocking and makes some of the slower parts worth it.",1395705600,2,265,4.866666666666666
6271039,4,B00IKM5LT0,"Blood Ties is a muscular and old-fashioned drama of crime and family.  It is the first English-language film by French actor and director Guillaume Canet, perhaps known best behind the camera for the art-house hit Tell No One.  He shares writing credit here with director James Gray, who has developed a small, but potent cult fan base for his films set in and around Brighton Beach, including We Own the Night and Two Lovers.  For his fans, his authentic, soulful, and urban touch overshadows any repetition in regard to content and location.  This new film bears a strong resemblance to We Own Night:  the focus is once again on brothers, one an honest detective (Billy Crudup) and the other a career criminal (Clive Owen), and their painful bid to understand and forgive one another amidst escalating tension and violence.

This is not a hard film for a cynic to criticize, so I am not surprised by the mixed reviews.  Though played by recognizable performers such as Marion Cotillard (the director's wife), Mila Kunis, and Zoe Saldana, none of the female characters are complex, functioning only as girlfriends and wives, betrayers and prostitutes.  For Gray, it could be described as a cinematic greatest-hits record, constructed from characters, confrontations, and themes lifted from his overall oeuvre.  And understatement is not always the film's strong suit:  note how a scene in which one character, a former drug user, relapses is set to none other than ""Heroin"" by the Velvet Underground.  Despite the flaws, however, Blood Ties is still entertaining, overflowing with period-perfect design choices and exciting heist and chase sequences.  And as the brothers, both stars are riveting; they give the domestic dysfunction depth and grit, ensuring the audience invests in their shared fate.  Owen in particular shines as a man who motions at times toward nobility and redemption, but always finds himself turning again to murder and theft out of desperation and self-hatred.",1395446400,39,1985,5.146417445482866

6271280,5,B00IKM5LT0,"""Blood Ties"" really brings me back  to the day...  I liked everything about this movie; the screenplay, the characters, the acting and actors, the directing, even the music (soundtrack).  Every sequence presented itself as a complete little vignette, lacking nothing.  Then, each vignette fit very nicely into the next vignette making the movie flow with coherency.  With such divergent characters you need a Director that can held it all together - which this Director did.  I rate this a ""Must See"".",1465776000,,501,5.1234567901234565

6271475,3,B00IKM5LT0,retro crime drama that is missing something I cant quite explain.

6271620,2,B00IKM5LT0,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. A snoozer all the way. Despite all the old Caddys and hippie collars and sideburns, vintage cop cars and 1970s pop music, I did not believe I was experiencing the 1970s in the U.S.A. for one second. Having lived through it, I know it was a lot grittier and flavorful and scary than this. The story is so ordinary. The ethnic, racial, class and cultural tensions of the time are barely explored. Where's that sense of doom that really existed at the time, with all that post Vietnam sense of failure, the helpless post assassinations feeling, all the factories shutting down, and Nixon's trickery and crookery in the White House? There is one point where the brothers argue about the police vs. the SLA, but it seems slapped on, and nothing that the brothers would ever actually discuss. The characters are one note. Even an old master actor like James Caan never becomes a full human being. I'm surprised James Gray worked on the screenplay because he usually writes much better. Maybe he needed to direct as well?",1457395200,,1036,4.793296089385475

6273029,2,B00IKM5LT0,"Stop watching half way. It was getting boring. Typical euro movie, lots of talking not enough action.",1434412800,,101,5.0
6273030,4,B00IKM5LT0,"It's frustrating that this did so poorly at the box office and among critics. At worst it is an exercise in restraint. From the moment that the Lieutenant asks Frank, ""Did you know that girl?"" and takes no answer for an answer, we know that this film is going to rely a great deal on what remains unsaid. It forces the actors to convey the emotional backstories (and there seem to be a lot of them) without the benefit of dialog. This is the sort of literary level of film-making that we don't see nearly enough of, that too many audiences cannot tolerate, and that too many film-makers are afraid to try. The gravity that James Caan and Billy Crudup are able to generate with their expressions and postures alone is worth seeing as a testament to this method of storytelling.

There is no debating that Zoe Saldana, Mila Kunis, and Marion Cotillard are squandered here. As other reviewers have suggested, their roles serve exclusively as catalysts to bring out the characters of the men and as such could have been played by anybody. The film is not misogynist so much as disinterested, focusing rather on the unrequited loves between the men in the movie. If you watch the film for what it is rather than as some other movie that you'd rather see, you can cope with the backgrounding of the lead actresses.

Clive Owen is probably miscast, and in any event his character is so cobbled together that, like the women, he, too, becomes primarily the MacGuffin for the characters of Caan and Crudup to develop. And that's okay, because watching Caan, Crudup and a surprisingly compelling Domenick Lombardozzi emerge in response to Owen is more than enough to carry the film.

I initially was drawn to the film because of its billing as ""70s crime drama,"" but it is hardly that. In fact, I was not able to find any evidence suggesting why the film is set in the 70s at all. Nothing about the era plays any part in the movie. It mainly seems like an excuse to raid the 70s bin at the thrift store and to put the local vintage car clubs on film, both of which are mildly fun and rarely distracting.

View the movie as a manner of poetry rather than narrative and appreciate it in that regard.",1434326400,,2187,4.515151515151516

6273516,3,B00IKM5LT0,"I don't remember this release so I came to it with no expectations or reservations. This is definitely worth missing.

Here's the scoop. One brother is a cop (Billy Crudup), the other is a criminal (Clive Owen) out of prison on work release. Owen is trying to walk the straight and narrow but it's just too tough and he starts to falter. Crudup tries to help him out but the task is too big. Dad's (James Caan) is just out of the hospital minus a lung. The sister (Lily Taylor) wants everyone to be happy. There's other stuff happening but you know this will all come to a head.

This is one long cliche. We've seen it before and we've seen it better. The women, Mila Kunis, Zoe Saldana and Marion Cotillard are all poorly written. Their characters just don't go deep enough and their parts of the story aren't resolved. Clive Owen and Marion Cotillard struggle with the New York accents which hurts whenever they deliver lines. James Caan, Billy Crudup, Tony Goldwyn and others do a decent job, but there simply are too few surprises here. I'm trying to figure out how they go this cast and the green light to do something so pedestrian.

There are some pretty cool scenes. The armored car heist. The final scene in the train station. The scene where Saldana visits her husband in the joint are genuinely decent. But they're few and far between. This isn't a bad watch by any means. The directing, editing, music (some of it) is all very professional. It's just a ho-hum outing.

I would visit this only after all my other ""to see"" movies have been exhausted.",1430438400,2,1560,4.5212765957446805

6273518,2,B00IKM5LT0,"This movie had such potential when I read the synopsis, but alas, I was so incredibly disappointed with it. So let's start off by saying that I like Clive Owen a lot. But man, I hated him in this movie. Clive cannot-- CANNOT-- do a Brooklyn accent. Why in the world was he cast for this part is beyone me. Billy Crodup was very good in this movie and I was sympathetic for his character, because he had tried after having a lousy childhood to be a good man so he became a cop to try and right the wrongs of his brother. James Caan was excellent. Zoe Saldana is easily one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood and a formidable acting force, and I felt she was woefully underutilized here. Her story was so interesting but her character was never fully fleshed out. Same goes for the Mila Kunis character. Like Owen, Marion Cotillard is just the wrong person for the part. Her accent is lousy. I can't figure out if she's trying to be Russian or Italian. It was just not working. Her character, despite the flaws was an interesting one.

Not a super fast-paced gangster flick like a Scarface or even Goodfellas; this kinda reminds me of The Wire set in 1974 (and its strange Marlo was a cop and Herc was a crook in the 70's LOL).

I would consider Blood Ties a ""rough draft"" of a potentially excellent movie; certain script changes would have made the storyline far more succinct and poignant. One reviewer considered this film comparable to Goodfellas. I respectfully disagree. Goodfellas is that perfect final draft; it has humor, wit, energy, and succinctness. Blood Ties feels a bit heavy handed and convoluted in comparison. Even so, I recommend this film for anyone who likes crime dramas.

go to it is not going to happen with some people.  I enjoyed the movie and I know people who have experienced similar things (minus the murders) and the heartache that the family goes through hoping and praying to change a career criminal into someone that can conform to society's norms.  I

6274151,2,B00IKM5LT0,"Shot in a 1970s style, Blood Ties certainly has the right look. The film features a great cast, that made me desperately want to see it, but the problem is that it's a very common tale and it moves along at a snails pace. Even with a story that's been done over and over again, Blood Ties still could have been something special, because of it's cast, but that didn't happen simply because it is one of the most predictable films I've seen all year. The film features two brothers, Chris (Clive Owen) a career criminal, just released from prison, and Frank (Billy Crudup) a New York City Detective, who tries to help Chris get back on his feet. Didn't I see this movie in 2007 when it was called We Own The Night? That film has the exact same tagline, but fortunately wasn't as predictable. Billy Crudup stars as the good brother and was the only interesting character in the film, surprising considering the film features two of my favorite actors, James Caan and Charlie Tahan. Unfortunately neither of them have a particular big or interesting role, as everything centers around these two brothers. The con is played by Clive Owen, who honestly seemed like he didn't want anything to do with this role. He is emotionless, uneven, and every time he has any kind of long dialogue, I thought I was going to fall asleep. The bottom line, one's a cop, the others a con, I wonder what's going to happen? What happens is exactly what you think is going to happen, so why even bother to watching this extreme disappointment?",1427673600,,1519,4.5677655677655675
6274152,5,B00IKM5LT0,Just saw The Gunman with Sean Penn not good at all. This film has heart. Truly a human drama.,1427587200,,93,3.9473684210526314

6274184,1,B00IKM5LT0,Terrible,1427587200,,8,8.0
6274185,2,B00IKM5LT0,"The trouble with this movie is that the conflict between two brothers never attains any sense of believability that's essential when it's the core element. Owen displays his usual and familiar brooding countenance that's his staple but is done in by a critical  flawed character trait (displayed vividly in a violent crime scene) that makes any empathy for him impossible. The scene (which I won't elaborate too much on) shows him to be an absolute animal with no regard for human life. Once that is established, it is impossible to view him as a tough but caring guy that the rest of the movie tries to make him out to be.  So, the movie is built on a lie, a premise that cannot be. All the other characters, though generally well acted, than becomes cartoon characters in an empty shell game. It's too bad because if the director had the brains to rework that one particular violent sequence, the whole movie would have held up fairly well with good actors to work with. When the attempt is to engage an audience in a serious crime drama, it would have been nice if the director didn't take the gun to his own head and sabotage the whole thing.",1427587200,,1146,4.531400966183575

To  see a period film capture the spirit of the period it is set in was a wonderful thing to behold.

So basically she has principles in one moment, then loses them in the next inexplicably and with no reasoning.

I also felt like some of the actors were just dipping in. Like I'll come, and put on the cool 70s outfits, but I'm not really going to lose myself in this. A family bound story, some great actors, but this movie is too derivative of too many other movies for me to really be able to recommend it. Go to the original reference material unless you are a Clive Owen or Billy Crudup completionist. Watch the original movies from the 70s.",1426118400,2,712,4.242647058823529

6275278,3,B00IKM5LT0,"I really wanted to like this movie, given the cast. After reading the summary, I thought to myself, ""oh, another one of ""THESE"" movies""... meaning that the criminal just out of the joint and just need to do one last ""job"" (so he says) mixed with the 2 siblings on either side of the law family drama. Don't we have enough of those movies? Anyway, the mere fact that Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, Lili Taylor and James Caan are in this movie led me to give it a chance. They were wonderful, the movie was very lackluster, to say the least.
The first half was extremely boring and, given that so little happens, I was surprised that they didn't take that to be the perfect opportunity to work on some character development, cuz there's virtually none of that. I really didn't care what happened to any of these people. Except maybe Lili Taylor's cuz she just plays sincere and caring so well.
As I said, all the actors were wonderful, including Mila Kunis, Zoe Saldana and Marion Cotillard (none of whom get a whole lot to work with... the women in this film are pretty much relegated to being girlfriends or ex-wives). There was some good action and suspense for a bit 2/3rds of the way in but then a really boring car chase. I had to laugh when the maracas kicked in on the Latin tinged suspenseful score during the chase scene. I don't know... had a feeling that the original screenplay was edited like crazy and the finished product was, unfortunately, this.

3-stars just for the actors being in the film and doing a kick-ass job (oh, and also for the costume, prop and set designers!!) but 2-stars for the film.",1425513600,8,1611,4.498293515358362

6275449,4,B00IKM5LT0,"Three stars is ""it's okay"" and four stars is ""I like it."" So call this 3.5, and there you have the title of this post.

You watch this movie to see James Caan, for one. It's an interesting call, that, because his character is not much of a person, so one has to think on how hard it might be to play a guy like that ... that's a talent, right?, to recreate someone who offers not much to work with? How does one do it?

As it happens, it's hard to like the other characters as well. Hard to find someone to root for. But that's life right?, so there's value there. And I have a thing for 70s cop movies/shows, and this period piece purports to that, so I am in.

The story itself is pretty basic, but there's a twist at the end which gives us one of the two headliners rendering his man as truer than we might've given him credit for.

As a retired law enforcement officer I did not find a false note in the script. It is not at all uncommon for law enforcement officers to have family members on the other side and the film accurately depicted the difficulties that can arise.
This movie was unusual in that it not only told the story from the point of view of the male leads but also dealt realistically with the problems faced by the families, particularly the women, who care for these men.

Always look for cars that are newer than the time the movie is portraying.  Couldn't find any mistakes in this film right down to the armored car.  No cell towers or people in more modern garb.  Language and idioms were right on track with the 70's.  Haircuts and clothing were hideous just like they were supposed to be.

6275860,4,B00IKM5LT0,"""Blood Ties"" is an interesting film.  While a little slow in paces, shedding the obvious fast pace of an action crime drama for character study and relationships, it succeeds; and then it doesn't quite.  Clive Owen plays Chris, let out from prison with a hair-pin temper that triggers frequently and fatally.  It's hard to root for him as he shoots an innocent store clerk.  Billy Crudup plays his brother Frank who is a policeman.  The tension between the two bubbles to the surface as their dad played by James Caan gets knocked down and hits his head on a table.  Lili Taylor does a nice job as the sister Marie who runs interference between the brothers.  I did like the way the film built to its ending in the train station.  But I wanted more from Frank, he seemed too tightly controlled and the emotional moments did not grab me.  In order for the film to work, we have to really like Frank, but we didn't so much.  Zoe Saldana does a great job as Vanessa, the wife of an ex-con who is an ex-girlfriend of Frank.  I enjoyed watching the film from beginning to end, although it's not one that I will revisit.

But I was not surprised to learn afterwards that this film only grossed $2.5 million but cost %25 million!  It was a commercial flop, supporting my criticisms.",1424822400,,459,4.617283950617284

6275877,4,B00IKM5LT0,"Surprising film that I viewed only because of the actors, Clive Owen and Billy Crudup. Not in a million years would I have recognized Billy Crudup as he plays the good detective son set in this 1970 Queens neighborhood. This is a tale of the good and the not so good sons, in a year of their lives.

Clive Owen, plays Chris newly released from prison after killing a man who killed his girlfriend. There is some honor among thieves. He is picked up at the prison by his brother, Frank, played by Crudup. Frank has curly hair in the 70's style,mince guy, trying to find the bad guys.mChrus has to live with Frank, since his ex-wife played by Marion Cotillard, does not want him. Chris works at a car repair shop set up by Frank,mbut it doesn't work out. The only good thing from the job is the secretary, Mila Sunis. T

This is a complicated family, dad played byJames Caan, is a smoker just out of the hospital where his lung was removed probably from cancer. Daughter, plYed by Lili Taylor, tries to keep,peace in the family, but there are always issues. Frank wants Chris's help in finding the bad guys, which is not going to happen. Frank is also following an ex girlfriend, Zoe Saldano, who is living with a criminal he wants to put away. A lot of tangles here, not many are innocent. Chris Hayes is trying to stay straight, and Frank is trying to find a life.

Superb acting by all, in a film that does not stumble. Kept my interest all the while.

Clive Owen and Billy Crudup play brothers from different sides the law.  Owen was a world class screw up ending up in the pen.  Crudup is the other side of the coin.  He plays a cop.  James Caan does an outstanding job being the dad.  Fresh out of the hospital, one lung removed, first thing he wants is a pack of smokes.

Was I entertained?  Heck yeah!  There's an awesome soundtrack.  The acting isn't forced and the characters are believable.  Heck, even the cars driven are looking good.

I watched ""American Hustle"" last week on Blu-ray and liked it as well, but ""Blood Ties"" may be more highly rated in 10-years. I thought Blood Ties captured a period better than American Hustle.  Of course, I liked 1974 better than I did 1980.  The scenes reminded me a lot of ""Serpico"".  Perhaps Blood Ties is clichd but so was the Godfather.  I don't mean to imply that I thought it was a movie at the same level as ""Godfather"" but I thought it offered a reasonable good brother/bad brother scenario.  Some of the acting was too subdued - especially the part of Frank.  Anyway, James Cain claimed no actor had ever made worse career choices.

6276195,5,B00IKM5LT0,"Family tension, gritty 70s crime sprees, hookers, conflicted cops, jilted convicts, blood in the streets; Blood Ties has it all.  Now, I say all of this and the first thing you're going to think is that this movie is one of those tightly wound action flicks that star Bruce Willis and are directed by Michael Bay and yet Blood Ties defies its genre and its material by maintaining a slow burn with a slick cast and a smart director.  It never thrusts too much in your face at one time, but pulls back and develops a rich tapestry of characters, themes and plot points over the course of two hours that leave us absorbed in this world.

Guillaume Canets crime drama is set in the 70s and focuses on two brothers on different sides of the law.  Frank, the younger brother, grew up straight.  He watched his older brother make mistake after mistake and used that as inspiration to right wrongs and stay on the straight and narrow.  Because of that, Frank is a cop, while his older brother Chris is a con who was just released from prison.  With nowhere to go and an ex-wife who hates him, Chris winds up moving in with Frank, much to the dismay of Franks department.  Still, Chris seems determined to clean up his act.  He gets a good job, reunites with some buddies who have some interesting business ventures lined up and even gets a new flame, Natalie.  Still, your past haunts you, and both Frank and Chris wind up realizing the truth of that statement.  Frank finds his passions for an ex-flame, Vanessa, to be too much for him to ignore, even if that means putting away her current boyfriend, Scarfo, and Chris finds that he cant seem to live down his past and soon he decides to embrace it.

But, when morality divides brothers, is blood truly thicker than water?

For me, Blood Ties was one of the biggest surprises for me this year.  I was expecting something dull and lifeless, but what I found was something so rich and engaging.  There are few films that can handle such a diverse set of characters and make them all feel so alive and detailed, and yet Blood Ties never lets you down.  Every characters relationship, interaction and backstory feels so fresh and grounded, and yet the film never loses the ease with which is progresses; it never feels overwrought or bogged down.

And lets just talk about how this ensemble is absolutely INCREDIBLE.  Ill say this first, even though it pains me, that Goddess Marion Cotillard is the weak link here, thanks to her horrid accent work, but even her missteps cannot tarnish the brilliant cast here.  Crudup and Owen ground this film so beautifully, anchoring the splintering relationships with such a believable brotherhood, strained and yet never broken.  James Caan is beautifully used as the conflicted, dying father, and Lili Taylor (I wish we saw more of her these days) is so moving as the sister trying to pull her family back together.  Mila Kunis continues to show she can hold her own when the material is worthy, and Zoe Saldana all but walks away with the entire film with her layered portrayal of a woman desperate to make sense of her current situation.  Her emotional fracturing is astonishing and heartbreaking.

Blood Ties is a slow burn, yes.  It contains so much and yet it tempers it so that the film can breathe.  But, because of that, the film glistens with such raw honesty.  Canet remembers that filmmaking is not about explosions and blood and sex but that, above all else, filmmaking is about telling a story, about building characters that we can remember, about bringing us into another world.

When the final scene hits, and our jaws drop, and our eyes meet Chriss and then Franks and our heart stops beating for a brief moment; that is when we know Canet succeeded in doing all those things.",1415664000,27,3775,4.612275449101796

It has tons of action including an Armored Car heist scene that rivals the great action scenes in ""Heat"". The movie succeeded as a cop movie and a requiem on dysfunctional families.

Amazon movie revivers have to be  kidding me !!!!
This movie has decent character development, soundtrack to die for, action-drama, and a somewhat Hollywood ending

The film is about two brothers, Clive Owen plays Chris (the ex-convict gangster) and Billy Crudup stars as the younger brother Frank (NY police detective).  The movie takes place in 1970's New York, Brooklyn.  Chris released after 9 years in prison is taken in by his younger brother, and given a low paying job.  Unhappy with his job and life he goes back to his old career as a man for hire/ bank robber. Frank eventually get involved in the crime spree his older brother perpetuates.  While Chris plays a violent gangster and Frank plays an upstanding cop, both brothers deal with their troubled personal lives while at the same time clash with one another at the family gatherings...in the end leading both to realize that blood ties are stronger then the lives they chose for themselves.  It is worth mentioning that the movie was shot on location in New York.",1405036800,,1064,4.845303867403315

The characters had real promise and could have been hell for each other in some dramatic and violent ways, but . . . nope.  Not really.  Nothing lives up to its potential here.

Blood Ties is like a conversation at a get-together with people who neither know each other well nor like each other much.  The talking lulls.  It gets uncomfortable.  Tension fills the air.  Boredom sets in.  The host is powerless and incompetent.  Everybody just wants to leave in time to get home and watch Breaking Bad.

6276447,4,B00IKM5LT0,"In BLOOD TIES the setting is New York, the time is 1974 and the problems faced by one family are more than they can surmount before the final credits role in this film. The story looks at one family that has many dysfunctional problems yet somehow bonds before the end of the film.

Billy Cruddup stars as Frank, a NYPD detective on the rise with more than one problem. His first revolves around his ex Vanessa (Zoe Saldana), a woman he gave up to their difference in race. Now married to a small time crook claiming to be straight, Frank still wants to be with her. Was it enough for him to send her husband to jail? That's a question never quite answered. His other more major concern is his brother Chris (Clive Owen). At one time close the two have drifted apart as Chris became more enmeshed in the criminal world, the opposite of his brother.

As the film opens Chris is being released from prison on a furlough program. While sister Marie (Lili Taylor) is glad to see him, Frank is a bit more hesitant. Chris has decided to be as straight as possible but between seeing his old friends and having problems at the day to day job he chose you know it won't be what he wants. Old habits are hard to break and eventually Chris is bound to return to his criminal escapades.

All of this doesn't bode well for Frank. With Chris living under his roof the rest of the NYPD doesn't look kindly on the situation. For Frank's family, in particular his ailing father (James Caan), their only hope is for Chris to do well. Unfortunately they also tend to turn a blind eye to anything that Chris might be involved in that isn't on the up and up.

Chris slowly gets back into his old ways. After a failed attempt at starting a new business, he gets involved with a crew of robbers. He visits his children and their mother Monica (Marion Cotillard), an ex-junkie who peddles her body on the street to support her and the kids. He meets a new flame where he works (Mila Kunis) and using the money he made robbing an armored car he marries and tries to set up a business, even if it is a whorehouse with his ex in charge.

For Frank things aren't going as well. Having Chris as his brother puts him on a bad path in the department. Getting back involved with Vanessa results in little more than her ex bringing violence into their lives or at least the threat of it. These two items combine to make the story of Frank one of family, both his blood relations and the family he chooses. The decisions Frank makes will affect both. Whether this is for the better or not isn't seen until the final scene of the film.

The movie captures the feel of New York 1974 with ease, never going for the most obvious depictions we normally get like Studio 54, instead offering us the small time clubs where low level criminals would hang out. In so doing they appear to be big time but in small locales. The costumer involved in this film deserves extra note, capturing the clothing of the ear without going overboard as well. That's the one thing that stands out when capturing the time line here. Not one piece goes over the top and yet it feels like not only the era the film takes place in but the movie has the look of films from that time.

There isn't a false note in any of the performances here. Cruddup does a great job portraying Frank as a man who wants to do the right thing and yet finds himself at odds because the one person he may have to place under arrest is his older brother. Owen does a great job as well making Chris a character who is willing to do bad things and yet tries to do the right thing at the same time. There is no way this can work and it's just a matter of time until things explode.

The movie never opened big, at least in this area, and from what I recall opened day and date on On Demand when it was released. With all the drek that is being released these days it's sad since this movie offered more drama and story than most coming out. Then again it sometimes feels like little more than explosions, CGI cartoons and sappy love stories are all that make the multiplexes these days. Let's hope that movies like this are paid enough attention that more are made and shown in theaters.",1403654400,,4201,4.302149178255373

Chris (Owen), who was in prison for a gangland murder, has just been released from prison and meets up with his brother Frank (Crudup) who is a cop. Their entire lives they have been different and even though they have grown up some things never change. When Chris tries to get his life back together he finds slipping into his previous routines much easier.  Once again the brothers are on opposite sides of the law. This is a hard movie to review and talk about. The movie is very good and worth seeing but it is also a little slow moving in some parts. This has shades of We Own The Night but its not as exciting as that one. I don't know if it was the acting or the writing but Chris was much more interesting and easier to root for even though he was the bad one.  Even though it was a little predictable that didn't take away from the movie at all. There have been many movies with a similar idea that have come out lately but to me none of them have really distanced themselves as being better than the others. While this was a good movie it was nothing amazing, Im glad I watched it but I wouldnt watch it again. Overall, a movie that Im glad I watched but really just another movie in a long line of brother vs. brother movies. I give this a B-.",1401408000,,1290,4.135458167330677

6276477,4,B00IKM5LT0,"I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS MOVIE.

 I LIKE CLIVE OWEN BUT I AM NOT USED TO SEEING HIM IN A ""BAD GUY"" ROLE.

BUT IS HE REALLY A BAD GUY?  A SORT OF BLACK SHEEP?

IS HE SOMEONE WHO PROMISES TO CHANGE- SEEMS TO WANT TO CHANGE, BUT ALWAYS SCREWS THAT EFFORT UP?

DOES HE CARE ABOUT HIS FATHER, SISTER AND BROTHER?

 OR IS HE JUST LOOKING OUT FOR HIMSELF- THE SELF ABSORBED SCAMMER THAT  COMES ACROSS THE SCREEN?

 THIS IS A LARGE PART OF WHAT THE  MOVIE EXPLORES.

I LIKED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE WHILE THINGS SOMETIMES SEEM OBVIOUS OR CLEAR CUT- LIFE IS FILLED WITH SHADES OF GREY.

IT WAS HARD TO SEE HOW THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.  I EXPECTED A MEGA DOWNER AS IT DREW TO A CLOSE.

INSTEAD- THE ENDING ACTUALLY ENDS UP BEING A MIXED BAG- BUT ONE THAT WE ALL CAN SAY IS QUITE APPROPRIATE AND IN A WAY- SATISFACTORY CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES.",1401062400,,858,4.140243902439025

6276479,1,B00IKM5LT0,"You get a sense of wasted talent, lost in direction and scripting that loses itself in pathos. There's a word that captures the feeling - wingey. Or meepy. Overloaded with shmaltz. The plot is less a plot than a series of fateful beatdowns of the characters. All so lopsided. The cop brother is especially annoying as written. You keep rooting for him to trip over his shoe laces. And then just stay down and disappear. I don't think it's his acting. Think it's the material. The older brother is much better and interesting but as others say, the women here are ciphers providing no balance to the men. Having grown up in NYC during the 70s, I recognize the post-Woodstock hangover feeling of the times, period when a Republican administration in Washington told the city's Republican mayor ""up yours"" when we sought help for bankruptcy. The movie - as told - feels wasted... somehow it made me think of the ash from a once-decent cigar - the afterglow long gone.",1399507200,2,964,4.676470588235294

Clive Owen does his usual fantastic job of not being able to act or show any kind of emotion, all while trying (and failing) to hide his English accent and affecting a terrible NY accent.  All the actors do a half-assed job in general.  The story is convoluted and uninteresting, long, and boring.  Boring.  OMG boring.  Don't waste your money or your time.

The ensemble is great: Clive Owen as the brother who tries to be on the straight and narrow--but quickly gives in to power, control, easy money; Billy Crudup, for this viewer, in one of his very best performances, as the brother who takes the high road, while trying to maintain family loyaly; Zoe Saldana as the love interest of Crudup's character--a love with tragic consequences; Mila Kundis as the love interest of Clive Owen's character. And the great James Caan as the father of the family; Lilli Taylor as the sister who is committed to family, despite the great difficulty. Recommended.",1398124800,2,623,4.831775700934579

the aftermath and psychological detail that precedes ultimate implosion.

8643078,3,B00IKM5LT0,"As others have noted this movie is ... meh. The actors of course are all great (although Clive Owen cannot control his English accent). The movie is set in the seventies WHY? Oddly enough it even has ""That Seventies Show"" Mila Kunis in the mix. I cannot put my finger on why this is no good - the premise is o.k., ex-con with cop brother, and ex wife that hooks for a living. Here are the big problems I suppose - as I see them.
The seventies setting is very distracting, and it takes away from the seriousness of this film.
None of the character are sympathetic - really you will not care about any of them.
The dialogue is sophomoric, and boring.
There is absolutely NO tension - that happens when the script does not allow us to care at all about the characters.
Clive Owen is miscast - really he just cannot hide the English accent so playing a New York gangster becomes comical.
James Caan, Billy Crudup, and Lily Taylor do their best, but it is not good enough to save this hot mess.",1480118400,,989,4.294117647058823
