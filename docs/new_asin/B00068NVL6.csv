2175328,5,B00068NVL6,"There is absolutely nothing in this legendary performace of ""Il Trovatore"" which makes you think ""weak"", ""could be better"", ""I've heard better"" and so on. What you hear and see on this DVD is nearly perfection: amazing live performance of the great bel-canto opera! And as usually, when Herbert von Karajan is a conductor, everything starts with his majesty, von Karajan! I don't think there is a better conductor for ""Trovatore"" than maestro Karajan. His understanding of ""Trovatore"" is perfect. I grew up listening to the recording of Trovatore with Karajan, Leontyne Price, Cappuccilli, Bonissolli and Obraztsova and from my childhood I established tremendous appreciation for Karajan in this particular opera. My favorite moment in Trovatore, as long as Karajan conducts it, remains the begning of the second act, dazzling chorus of gypsies. It is incredable: every person on the stage and every instrument in the orchestra must give 200% Forte. So far I have not found better Forte than the one which Karajan can squiz out from a cast and an orchestra. Simply brilliant.

Now lets turn the attention to the principle characters and let's start with Piero Cappuccilli. What can I say? I think he was born to sing Di Luna. This is his role. Nobody sounds more dramatic, passionate and powerful than he does, not even my favourite baritone, Etorre Bastianini. Raina Kabaivanska is excellent Leonora. Well, maybe she is not exactly Leontyne Price, but she is good enough to make you go nuts! She is very powerful soprano and she is indeed great Leonora.

Fiorenzza Cossotto is one of the best mezzo-sopranos of 20th century and this DVD illustrates it. By the end of 70-ies Cossotto was not young, but her voice still sounds fresh, powerful and terryfing (But I still prefer Elena Obraztsova's Azuccena). Placido Domingo is at his peak. He has one not so great note, which would be the high C at the end of the 3rd Act caballeta, but who cares? The rest of Placido sounds really good. His voice is full, reach and very beautiful. And finally Jose Van Dam is ""overqualified"" for Fernando's role. He is amazing.

So this is must have for anyone who cares about opera. Defenitely on of the best DVD-s you will ever buy.",1102377600,70,2217,4.85978835978836
2175329,5,B00068NVL6,"One had been hearing for years about this production, a live performance of 'Trovatore' prepared by Karajan for Austrian television but never released on video until now. I gather there have been bootleg tapes circulating for years, but I'd never seen one. Karajan, on his triumphant return to the Vienna State Opera the year before, had been treated to opulent conditions. He picked the cast, produced the opera with his own chosen collaborators--Georges Wahkevitch designed the sets and costumes, Robert Stangl did the lighting--and the 1977 series was an unblemished triumph. His cast that time was similar to this one, except that Leontyne Price sang Leonora and Luciano Pavarotti sang Manrico. But that production was not videotaped. The next year he returned to make a television broadcast, in this case with the right to choose the television director, G&uuml;nther Schneider-Siemssen. This time, however, one of his favorite sopranos, Raina Kabaivanska, replaced Price, and tenor Franco Bonisolli was to sing Manrico. But at the last moment--during the dress rehearsal, in fact--Bonisolli pulled out; accounts vary as to why this was, but legend has it that he was angry that the invited audience did not respond kindly to his third act cabaletta 'Di quella pira.' Be that as it may, Karajan was able to get Pl&aacute;cido Domingo to substitute for the live performance to be broadcast. It had originally been scheduled to be beamed all over Europe, but because the last minute cast change pushed the date of broadcast back by a few days, only Austrian TV carried it. The previous year's 'Trovatore' had been issued as  recording, and there is no doubt that it is wonderful. But this one is, in my opinion, even better. Kabaivanska's soprano may not have the richness of Price's (and she doesn't have a trill) but her vocal acting is superior and I would put her up against any soprano singing today; there's no doubt she would meet the competition. As to the rest of the cast, it is impossible to come anywhere close to it these days. Piero Cappucilli is a magnificent, lizard-eyed Count di Luna and has that burnished Verdi baritone that one simply doesn't hear often these days. His 'Il balen' is sensational. Ferrando, in some houses a relatively minor part or at least one relegated to a secondary baritone, is sung by none other than Jos&eacute; van Dam! Ferrando's Narrative in Act I is not ever for one moment a bore, as it can sometimes be. Azucena is taken by Fiorenza Cossotto and her voice rings out throughout its range. Further, she is a scarily effective gypsy woman motivated by revenge for her mother's death at the hands of di Luna. Her triumph in the final scene is something to behold. Before that her 'Stride le vampa' gives one goosebumps. Even the minor role of Ruiz is taken by a tenor, Heinz Zednik, who went on to sing leading roles primarily in the German repertoire.

Kabaivanska is a beautiful, slim woman who certainly looks the part; indeed the whole cast is physically attractive. Her singing is nuanced, subtle and yet dramatically pointed when needed. Her pianissimi are breath-taking. The lack of a trill is about the only criticism I can come up with, to be honest. 'Tacea la notte placida' and 'D'amor sull'ali rosee' are marvelous. In the 'Miserere' the voice rides above the chorus with ease; there is an occasional slight under-pitch problem here, but it is of little importance in the drama of the moment.

Domingo, who may be slightly strained in the more dramatic parts of 'Di quella pira' (but not by much, let me assure you), is simply magnificent as the Troubador. 'Ah s&igrave;, ben mio' is meltingly sung and his scenes with Azucena and with Leonora are heroically conveyed. Further, his voice has a ring that I had forgotten he had back then. It wasn't long after this that he began essaying some Wagner roles and now I can see why.

Karajan conducts a slightly slower 'Trovatore' than we are used to, although it's nowhere near as slow as Giulini's recording made not long after this. The slow tempo is particularly noticeable, and surprisingly effective, in the Act II finale ('E deggio, e posso crederlo?'). It allows the individual voices to emerge more clearly, and I must say that Kabaivanska's voice rings out as the upper line of this ensemble with thrilling immediacy, partly because Karajan seems to breathe with her. The Vienna State Opera orchestra and chorus are superb, as one would expect, but Karajan seems to get the very best out of them: alert attacks and clarity throughout, dramatically apt acting from the chorus.

The video aspects of this production are not as crisp as we are used to these days. This was 1978, after all, and it is clear that the tape from which this DVD was made had to have some doctoring. There is what I believe to be an electronically-produced scrim effect in Leonora's scene in Act I,  but perhaps this was an attempt to cover a somewhat defective tape at that point. None of this is of any detriment whatever, at least to me. The sets and costumes are not only rich and lovely, the whole production is cast in traditional terms: these people and scenes actually look as if they are set in 15th-century Spain--none of this senseless time-shifting so commonly seen these days. The audio is life-like and and modern-sounding in spite of being almost thirty years old. This is a 2DVD set. There are no extras. Subtitles in English, German, French, Italian. 151 mins.

I must say that this set has exceeded my own fairly high expectations. This is a production for the ages.

Strongest recommendation.

2175340,5,B00068NVL6,"I was surprised to find that TDK no longer has the license to issue this DVD and that no other company has stepped in to close the breach. Even though I have given the set five stars it is far fom perfect, both vocally and scenically. But it does date back to 1978 and in some ways it should be treated as a historical document. First HvK on made three operas live--the other two were a Rosenkavalier and Falstaff. The rest were films of varying degrees of execution. Karajan the conductor is one that will be remembered; his contribution to staging is is of questionable merit.

In 1978, Domingo was ten years after his Met debut; the voice is plangent and beautiful. Physically he is handsome and is an invoved actor. Alas he was not able to articulate the trills in the Ah si ben mio; in the studio this was not so much a problem. He is only alloted one verse of Di quella and the high C was hardly secure. I admit to being a fan and even with the mentioned short comings I rate his over any of the other Manricos. Kabaivanska has a very idiosyncratic voice; in Italy she became the verita assoluta. She had a fair to middling career at the Met, but she doesn't have the spinto voice that appeals to Americans who by and large prefer what Zefferelli called ""vocal armchairs"". It has resinous, somewhat reedy tember that I find appealing. I am not sure that I would have chosen her for Leonora, but I prefer her to Sutherland, Villaroel and Marton her competition on DVD. Alas she is not allowed her cabaletto in the last act. In 1978 Cossotto was in the final phase of her career; never a fastidious artist, she does throw herself in the role with great abandon. She can be somewhat casual as regards pitch, and is occasionally flat at crucial moments. I saw Cappucilli a number of times in Vienna; never the most exciting singer, he was one of the last Verdi baritones. If he were singing today he would have more engagements than he could accept. I found the voice quite beautiful.

This is currently only available through Amazon's ""sellers"". Even with the caveats I would recommend it over Trovatores that are in the current catalogue.",1232150400,2,2142,4.48974358974359
2175341,2,B00068NVL6,"Il Trovatore is my favorite Verdi score.  I previously owned the Met version with Pavarotti and found it nearly unwatchable because of the stiff acting.  After deciding to expand my DVD collection recently, this von Karajan version of Trovatore was at the top of my list - largely due to the reviews listed here.  I knew the tempos would be slow and was prepared for some unimaginative staging.  Even so, this had to be the biggest disappointment of any opera DVD experience I've had so far.

Herbert von Karajan was clearly a master conductor.  But he should not have tried his hand at directing.  His direction consists of the lack thereof.  The singers do not emote, nor do the move.  They are frozen statues whose eyes dart to the pit and back more than in any other opera I've seen.  As a huge Domingo fan, I was shocked by his breathy, severely off-pitch delivery (though the audience went nuts for him).  I have never seen Raina Kabaivanska before, but she was awful (in her case, the audience was not as forgiving).  She had moments of beauty, but she literally screamed for her dramatic high notes.  Her voice cracked several times.  She too faltered on pitch several times.  Piero Cappuccilli has a perfect baritone, but he was the worst actor over all.  In fact, he didn't even attempt to emote.  He could have been singing the phone book!  Cossotto began unimpressive in her vocals, but grew stronger.  However, she also cracked and screeched a couple of her high notes, including the final note of the entire opera, which put a damper on things.  At least she understood what it means to portray a character - I appreciated that.

The highlight of this performance - by a mile - is the opening sequence with Jose Van Dam.  The staging, lighting, and delivery gave the promise of a moody and insightful night of opera.  But that promise is not fulfilled;  this DVD is not recommended.  I will probably sell mine.",1230249600,14,1924,4.637982195845697
2175342,5,B00068NVL6,"Fortunately, most of the people agree with me. This performance is superb including Kabaivanska voice. The best I've ever heard. Voices and orchestra are excellent.",1224547200,,164,5.6
2175343,3,B00068NVL6,"I cannot share the general admiration for this performance. Bernard Shaw once wrote of Trovatore, ""It has tragic power, poignant melancholy, impetuous vigor, and a sweet and intense pthos that never loses its dignity. It is swift in action and perfectly homogeneous in atmosphere and feeling."" What I miss in the present performance is the picaresque sweep that Shaw's words imply. The singing is unquestionably superb, the orchestral playing is fine as such. The principals convey much of the passion vocally but the overall impression is of a sort of housebroken Verdi. Trovatore is an early forerunner, to my mind, of ""La Forza del Destino"" with its tapestry of gypsy camps, convents , army camps. In fact it is the chorus scenes in this performance that are the biggest letdown: around one anvil in the gypsy camp the gypsies wander around aimlessly, sipping genteelly at their wine (a few look bored), mildly interested in the musings of crazy Azucena(who really is in the spirit of the thing!); the nuns in the next scene are mildly peturbed at the incursion of all these soldiers. (The fight as the curtain descends the is the only staging that conveys any of the energy that the rest so sadly lacks.) The army camp scene is ridiculous: ""Now we play at dice"" sing di Luna's troops...all in serried ranks neatly assembled; a flag in the background shows the only movement! The whole production is too polite and thus in a sense wildly misguided. To vary the old admonition, this a Trovatore that should be heard and not seen.",1223510400,5,1531,4.82509505703422
2175344,5,B00068NVL6,She is simply magnificient. I have all of her music. Strong vocal ability and stage performance. I think she does best Verdi's and Puccini's.,1213315200,3,141,4.916666666666667
2175345,5,B00068NVL6,"This is an excellent performance overall. Cappuccilli is an impressive Count, both on voice and acting. Cossotto is a superb Azucena, comparable to her unsurpassable recording for Mehta with Domingo and Price. Domingo in fine voice sings and acts with remarkable comfort and realism. Kabaivanska one of the most beautiful visually Leonoras, sings with soul and passion. Stage direction could have benefited from a professional director; Karajan's direction is conventional, concert style. Needless to say, however, his conducting is magical.

The picture quality on 32"" and larger screens is mediocre at times. Occasionally, you have the impression that you are watching the performance through a curtain of fog; colors are not always sharp and vivid.

Notwithstanding the minor criticisms, which are not related to the musical performance, this is an excellent piece of artwork.",1201046400,5,879,5.552238805970149
2175346,2,B00068NVL6,"What a disappointment this Trovatore and what a waste of great and talented singers. All because of the awful and slow direction of Karajan and a bad chosen Leonora.

It is well known that Kabaivanska was one of Karajan's favorite sopranos, but that does not allow him to ruin what could have been one of the perfect Trovatores with the one sung by Corelli-Price-Simionato-Bastianini, also directed by Karajan and also slow but not extremelly as this.

Mr Jose van Dam is in all aspects an artist and a gentleman. He has a pretty and wonderful voice and technique. He gives the small role of Ferrando heights as I have never seen or heard in any other Trovatore. He is really a great singer and here is the proof. I am lucky to have seen him live, singing Les Contes d'Hoffmann and it is really a pleasure.

Piero cappuccilli is a good conte di Luna. but his voice was never specially beautiful. For me Dimitri Hvorostovsky is the best conte di luna that I have heard, in the Trovatore sung at the ROH wtih Villarroel, Cura and Naef.

Placido Domingo is great as Manrico, with a beautiful baritonal voice but with some difficulties singing Di quella pira. He is outstanding, specially in the duets with Cossotto's Azucena. Both seems to be uncomfortable with the slow tempi of the orchestra and had to slow down their singing, mainly in the duets (sounds like lullaby) of the second act where the orchestra played extremelly slow.

Fiorenza Cossotto is really a great Azucena. Her dark chest voice and her technique allows her to sing a perfect and memorable Azucena. Simionato is the greatest and I guess the voice verdi was thinking of for that role. The only problem with her was that the slow tempi of the orchestra made her visible uncomfortable.

Raina Kabaivanska is a good singer but for Butterfly and other verismo operas, but not at all for Leonora. Her voice and her visible trill difficulties (maybe this caused the slow orchetral direction), if she had some trill, made her an awful Leonora, mainly in the first act. I have to recognize that she sang a very good and sweet D'amor sull'ali rosee. but that's not enough.

The stage and costumes and direction are correct, but so dark that sometimes is difficult to distinguish the singers and that darkness contributes to a bad DVD image.

The remastered sound to DTS is not good, mainly dark, not clear and sometimes the voices sound far.

The television direction is not good because of many close up (could be for the darkness) and what is worse and ridiculous, the singing in off. I mean with this that, mostly in the duets Manrico-Azucena, one of them was singing but the camera was focused on the other for a long time

Not a Trovatore to buy. I am trying to sell mine. Buy the one taped at the Royal Opera House or the one from Arena di Verona.",1196380800,5,2812,4.594810379241517
2175347,3,B00068NVL6,"As performances go, this one is quite exciting; I would echo some of the other reviewers in terms of the relative strengths of the singers, but would also credit the theatre audience to some extent for that excitement. You can feel the folks on the edges of their seats, ready to show their appreciation by exploding with applause after the good arias and duets (by the way, unlike the Met, they--the audience at the Vienna City Opera--don't applaud after every single aria, just the ones they love). Domingo is great but doesn't quite know what to do after the Ah Si, ben mio in act 3 when the applause is so sustained. I thought Kabaivanska was a strong, but not greatly engaging, singer, and not the greatest actress. She just didn't quite bring enough passion to the role and appeared to be working too hard.

I was disappointed in the sound quality, although I guess it was about standard for 1978; not bad, but a little rough in places. Apparently, they didn't use parabolic mikes (see my review of La Boheme for a long-winded explanation of miking); there were three mikes above the stage, which show in the video, and several in the orchestra, which also show. I suppose this makes sense for this particular opera, since there are so many choruses. I have an old remastered RCA CD of the same opera, originally cut in 1970, with Domingo and Cossotto in the same roles (Leontyne Price is wonderful in the Leonora role). This CD has MUCH better sound than the subject DVD and gives me more goose bumps.

Apparently this performance has some historical significance in that von Karajan was very keen on TV and video for opera, and Domingo was substituted at the last minute for another singer who didn't work out well.

There are a few weird aspects of the video quality, which was generally ok, but not great. In the garden scene in Act 1, the director decided to put some sort of fabric over the camera lens, which is a little annoying. I'm not sure just what the point was or what we were supposed to think.

Overall, I guess it's worth the money, but if a recent production comes up that has excellent sound quality, you'll probably want to buy that one too.",1184889600,2,2167,4.5629820051413885
2175348,5,B00068NVL6,"This interpretation of Verdi's ""Il Trovatore"" is probably the most complete and masterful performance of all time.  Placido Domingo, as Manrico, the Troubadour, shows his great versatility and acting ability.  His ability to trill ranks with the best.  He is equally compelling with both Kabaivanska and Cossotto.  Cossotto, the fiery gypsy who has raised Manrico, takes ones breath away with her dynamic acting and singing.  Van Dam, and Cappuccilli are both in splendid voice and entirely believable in their roles.  The great Raina Kabaivanska, in the role of Leonora has no equal.  What others may write of her performance, pales in the words of the inimatable Maestro Herbert von Karajan.  These are his exact words, ""(Raina Kabaivanska's) interpretation, both from vocal and artistic point of view, shall remain forever a model of artistic perfection."" Who needs further proof of her magnificent Leonora?  If you love opera, this is a must have video and/or DVD!  G. K. Brown, DMA",1170115200,13,986,5.1835443037974684
2175349,5,B00068NVL6,"I bought this DVD specifically because of Cossotto, who is my all time favorite mezzo. What I got was a video of a Trovatore that is as good as it can get. In fact, I would rate this as the best opera video I have seen. Domingo, Cappuccilli, Cossotto and Van Dam are sensational. Kabaivanska, while not as good as the fore mentioned singers, is still far above most Leonora's. If you are only going to buy 1 opera video, make it this one. A true gem, absolutely flawless.",1168905600,9,471,4.303370786516854
2175360,5,B00068NVL6,"The biggest complaint I have heard thus far about this performance is the excruciatingly slow tempo. If you listen to Giulini's recordings (most notably his set with Domingo and the Orchestra dell Academia di Santa Cecilia), he did much of the same as he got older. An even better example would be a comparison between Riccardo Muti's '77 Trovatore with Maggio Musicale in Florence, to that of his performance twenty years later at La Scala. The young Riccardo was brash, boisterous, and flashy (very Neopolitan). After a lifetime in Milan, the Toscanini copycat became much more precise, exacting every note as the composer intended. So, I doubt that `taking it slow' has anything to do with lack of stamina (Levine at his ripe old age could perform an entire Ring cycle without skipping a beat...so to speak). Familiarity is the crux of any piece from a performers' point of view, but can threaten a blas approach from the outset if they don't constantly try to find new ways to interpret the work. This is precisely what the true masters of music making do, as is very evident in this DVD recording from one of the greatest.

This is clearly Karajan's triumph. With world class musicians at one's disposal, it's easy to get results on demand. However, these are Viennese musicians, and they don't stray from routine so easily. Getting them to play at nearly half the requisite speed must've been quite an undertaking in of itself, but this allowed the maestro to wring out every ounce of passion from the score. The attention to detail becomes prominent with each articulate stroke, carefully built dynamics, and well paced singers.

It would not be the first time that Placido Domingo had been asked to stand in for an ""ailing"" tenor, but this time the blessed event had been captured on video for posterity. This production was all the better for it, and the audience rewarded the (then rising) star with applause that went on for nearly three minutes after his rendition of 'Ah si, ben mio'. Coming from a young Domingo, his pianissimos weren't quite as polished as they are now, and his 'di quella pira' displayed a few strained (and flat) high notes, but even his off performances outshine the best of his peers.

No one can gypsy the way Fiorenza Cossotto gypsies, and here her Azucena flairs with terrifying ferocity. Some bemoan Karajan's apparent inability to make his singers move on stage, but directing Cossotto to sit rigid before a fire during 'stride la vampa' had a chilling effect (thanks to some brilliant lighting). Her thrilling duet with Manrico in act 2 is one of the highlights of this perfomance. Piero Cappucilli seemed somewhat diminished as Conte di Luna, and as uninterested in Manrico as he was unconvincing in his pining for Leonora. Still, he's one of the better Counts out there (maybe he was feeling ill?).

Raina Kabaivanska had the unenvied task of filling one of the many roles that Maria Callas held sway over for generations, but the Bulgarian diva did her role justice. Although her acting was somewhat stiff, she sang with athletic reflexes and a vocal flexibility to match (some might say surpass) that of her much younger counterpart, Domingo. Since this is a Karajan production, even the smaller roles receive first rate performances, most notably those by Jose van Dam and Heinz Zednik. The sets were very simple and straightforward, in what some might consider a `traditional' presentation. Again, some very effective lighting maintained an eerie ambience throughout.

This is possibly one of the best accounts of Il Trovatore available. If not for the superior orchestra, or the omnipresent Domingo, then the momentous occasion alone (given this was Karajan's last run with the troubadour) should be more than enough reason to see this stellar production.",1153699200,14,3804,4.9375
2175361,4,B00068NVL6,"Overall a great performance but WHY ON EARTH did they cut out Leonore's ""Tu vedrai che amore in terra""? There's an immediate jumpcut to Act 4, Scene 2. Was very disatisfied with this, as it is one of my favorite parts of the opera. Also beware, the listing says one disc but the opera is actually split on 2 discs. Kind of annoying if you want to watch the thing straight through with no breaks or interruptions(like me who is an opera fanatic). Fantastic singing from Domingo, he is in top form and I'm glad I bought it for that.",1146268800,15,530,4.31
2175362,5,B00068NVL6,"The cast here is not as perfect as the one in Karajan's recording of Cavalleria Rusticana.

Karajan himself isn't the best choice for conducting this opera:

He's obviously inspired and has many interesting ideas about the score, but I realy believe that ""Il Trovatore""'s effect relies on the singers and not on the conductor, who may disturb them putting in too much of his own.

He's the best in Wagner and more wagnerian operas like Cav and Pagliacci!

The same can be said about Domingo: He also has much to say as Manrico, plus he is in top vocal form and has strong ringing voice, but he's not flexible enough and the voice is too rich.

Cappuccilli is also too sophisticated dramatically for his part, but I enjoyed it.

Still, beside these ""faults"" the rest is unsurpassable:

Kabaivanska is good looking and has a very pleasant voice, never attacking a note.

She has no rough edges and controls the range flawlessly.

There is a good chemistry between her and Domingo and their scenes together are pleasure to watch.

I wonder if Verdi ever dreamt of such a great performence of his most important mezzo role.

Cossotto rocks the house with her chest voice!

In her duet with Domingo she sings even stronger than him.

She vibrates her upper voice histerically to achieve shrillness,

and you're ending up stunned after her story-telling!

She succeeds very well in demonstrating the complex feelings of the character!

Another big plus it to be found in the minor roles: Van-Dam and Zedink are two of the greatest!

Very few great singers such as those are willing to take these roles (Ivo Vinco is the only one to come up in my mind).

Lovely sound, fine picture, refined orchestral playing.

Nearly perfect!",1145750400,4,1720,4.75
2175363,5,B00068NVL6,"Since I am only a beginner in opera, I dunno what I can say about this DVD and the acting about the singers in detail, but I do heard a lot of voices from different singers. Around 1 year ago I just discovered opera singers have such good voices in a sudden, seemed like I suddenly discovered some treasure I would say (before that mostly I just listen pop music), so afterward a while I get used to listen opera singers' gorgeous voices I decided to try a real opera performance, and I bought this DVD. At first I bought this because I like Placido Domingo, but after I watched, what I was amazed the most was baritone Piero Cappuccilli, bass-baritone Jose Van Dam, and mezzo soprano Cossotto. Of course Placido Domingo also good, but he does not ""stand out"" that much here, probably because his character is more like...a guy that has only passion, and simple mind. I found Cappuccilli has a strong voice, and his voice and acting shows the jealousy that his character really needs, and Cossotto also gave me a very strong impression of ""hatred, revenge, wrath"" when her voice comes out. And even Jose Van Dam, who is not an important character in this performance, stands out pretty much as if he is the main character. Raina Kabaivanksa also has a pretty good voice and she gave me a feeling of a ""tough woman"" in the performance. But overall I like Piero Cappuccilli the most, and his duet with Kabaivanksa is simply amazing. For real Karajan conducts slower than other recordings I hv heard from this opera work, but maybe I don't have much experience in watching opera performance yet, I don't find that is a problem. What a pity is this recording is from 1978 so the sound quality is not ""that"" good, though for a recording from 1978, has such sound quality is pretty good already. If the sound quality is better I would enjoy much better.",1140480000,8,1847,4.532934131736527
2175364,3,B00068NVL6,"The looks of this video and the cast are fine, but Karajan's conducting is so slow on many of the cabalettas, it's annoying.  Also, Kabaivanska is not my favorite soprano - her voice always seems to have a hard edge to it, which displeases me greatly, however many people enjoy her just fine - she is a good singer with a lot of class and she always kept herself looking nice.  Placido Domingo seems a bit uncomfortable with the agonizing pace of the 'Di quella pira...', but otherwise he performs beautifully.  Everything else about this video is very good, with Cappucilli and Cossotto performing flawlessly.  I have three other Trovatores with Karajan conducting and this is definitely his slowest and the slowest recording of this opera I have ever heard, particularly on the cabalettas.  I understand why most people give this one 5 stars, but for me, Kabaivanska takes one away and the slow pace takes away another one.",1129334400,12,925,4.7924528301886795
2175365,5,B00068NVL6,"There are so many reasons why this film from the Salzburg Festival in 1977 is the all-time greatest Trovatore ever made. For one thing, Herbert Von Karajan was in his final year as conductor at the Salzburg Festival before taking up a more permanent position as conductor for the Berlin Philharmonic through the 80's.  Karajan is conducting with achingly slow tempi as if to bid farewell to what must have been his favorite opera. Years before in 1962, in the Salzburg Festival, he had made it big conducting a supreme Trovatore starring Leontyne Price and Franco Corelli, a performance which was transferred to the Metropolitan Opera as both these singers debut. This Trovatore is blessed with a fantastic and unbeatable cast. Leontyn Price was contractually unavailable to sing Leonora and had sung the role the year before opposite Luciano Pavoratti. Instead, Hungarian diva Raina Kabaivanska, a new star in the opera firmament replaced Price and won great acclaim as Leonora. Kabaivanska's voice is rich, bright and full-lyric with a dramatic thrust. Her Tosca from 1975 opposite Placido Domingo and Sherill Milnes is a legend, and a stunning film shot in Rome. As for her Leonora, she gives us the same radiance as Tosca only with a lazer-sharp Verdi operatic voice. Her Leonora of course lacks the grace and majesty of Leontyne Price, but her voice is beautiful and commanding. Her Leonora is appropriately noble and vulnerable. I thoroughly enjoyed all her big scenas and arias - ""Tacea La Notte"" ""Di quell Amore"" ""Sul Amore La Rosee"" and the grand Miserere Scene. Her death scene is very moving.

Placido Domingo's Manrico is an experienced portrayal. He had sung the role numerous times in his career and he has an excellent studio recording on RCA Opera Treasury label opposite Price, Milnes and Cossotto. His Manrico is debonaire, spiritual and passionate. He is especially striking in his duets with Fiorenza Cossotto's Azucena and in his scenes with Kabaivanska's elegant Leonora. Domingo echoes Caruso in his ""Di Quella Pira"". He looks great and his voice is at his best, marked by squillo high notes, stentorian exclamation and dark lower voice. I don't want to say much about Fiorenza Cossotto because I always find her performances shrill, melodramatic to a fault and just plain lousy. Her mezzo voice lacks the thrill and grandeur that such mezzos as Grace Bumbry, Shirley Verrett, Dolora Zajick and in older days Giuletta Simionato possessed. Her Azucena is witch-like and ok character-wise but her voice is just never been a pleasure for me to hear. I overlook her flaws only because I am so in love with Kabaivanska and Domingo's portrayals in this film.

Now Piero Cappuccilli was a true baritone in the grand manner. His voice was loud, lyric and earthy. He had charisma and genuine dramatic integrity. His Count Di Luna is appropriately evil and powerful. This film makes a fine tribute to his art. Cappuccilli died only a few months ago this year. Among other acheivements include Verdi's Macbeth, Amonasro from Aida, Scarpia and other fine roles. He is one of the great baritones of his day - unfortunately no one knows it as he was so underrated in a time when Sherill Milnes was reigning. I find him BETTER than Milnes.

Overall this is a terrific Trovatore. The sets are rather inexpensive and it shows (they look like cheap water paintings almost) but the costumes are accurate to this ""Don Quixote"" time as I'd like to call it. Domingo and Kabaivanska look great in their costumes. The music is wonderful, the plot is dramatic enough to serve as material for a soap opera - Gypsy avenges her mother's death by having the Count who is his brother kill him unknowingly for a rivalry to win Lady Leonora's hand. This opera is still popular and it is a staple of Verdi singers.",1129075200,13,3804,4.8930232558139535

Hearing the familiar music in its context with a great cast makes me wonder why anyone would want to buy the CD. Opera on DVD has got to be the way to go from now on.

Domingo is at is best (although I have to admit that I have heard ""Di quella pira"" better from him but on the other hand, I have heard it worse 90% of the time from other singers as well...), ""Ah si, ben mio"" is pure heaven. Kabaivanska seems sometimes a bit harsh but her phrasing, her pianissimo is excellent. Capucilli is excellent as we are used to, Ferrando is superbly cast with Van Dam.

8040231,3,B00068NVL6,"Verdi's Il trovatore is a somehow strange masterpiece: very weak libretto, improbable situations - on and off stage, but full of unforgettable melodies. it can be called a HITS opera. In the right hands - singers, conductor, stage director - it can be a unique experience. Not so here, Vienna 1978.
Karajan was notorious for his ego and ambition. He thought he was a kind of super-hero, that can and is allowed to do everything on stage and with the orchestras or singers that he worked with.
He was, indeed,, a very good conductor. But he was not a good stage director. He always liked to work with singers that bent to his will. Also singers that did not mind to sing roles that did not fit them, or did not over-shine the Supreme God called von Karajan ! Just imagine lyrical  soprano Freni , in Aida and Don Carlo.
Bonisolli did not accept his dictatorship behavior and left the stage in a rage. Domingo, a baritone turned tenor without a C and even less a high C,
stepped in. He is a marvelous intelligent musician, but he is NOT a Corelli, Bonisolli, or for this event - a Trovatore. NO high notes.
Kabaivanska had a nice medium sized soprano, but a cold sound, without a single trill. Cappuccilli is a good undramatic di Luna, Cossotto is , as always , Cossotto. Dramatic forceful singing  and a blade sharp sound. She is not a Simionato or a Barbieri. In the short role of Ferrando, van Dam does most he can do with a baritone sound for a bass one.
The staging is a Karajan one. Static like his Carmen with Bumbry or his Beethoven video recordings with the players presented like well behaved Prussian soldiers. I wonder why he did not ask to play the orchestra and sing the chorus and soloists. He would have been accepted by the producers. After all he was considered a Living God !
As for his conducting, it is good. It does not have the Italian slancio, but it fits the western Europe musical taste. An evening at the Vienna State Opera is a feast  itself.
Arthaus  made wonders with the original TDK discs. A clear picture and very good sound for it's period, despite Karajan's strange demands of microphones placing.
Personally, I won't be without this recording but not the only one. How lucky we are, these days, being able to compare different recordings and interpretations .",1502755200,,2293,4.531400966183575
8040232,5,B00068NVL6,Every cast member was first rate but Fiorenza Cossotto as the gypsy woman was the stand out.  She made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.  I will never forget her performance.  No one will ever surpass her in this role.  No one.  You have to see/hear her to believe how great she is.  ~ Celeste Downey,1469145600,,309,4.066666666666666
8040233,5,B00068NVL6,"This was the first time I had seen a performance of this opera.  I had taken time to go over the libretto (in English) so I was familiar with the plot and the characters.  I loved it at once; however, the star of the performance to me was Ms. Cossotto.  She 'was' her character.  Her acting and facial expressions were so emotional.  They zoomed in frequently on her face so this is not a fleeting comment.  I thought Placido Domingo was a bit wooden in his acting, but his singing was superb.  The filming was very well done and sets were appropriate.  All in all, I'm going to watch it again very soon - and enjoy every minute!

8040236,3,B00068NVL6,"Which character would you look for in such an opera as Il Trovatore?
Naturally, Manrico.
How does Domingo's Manrico measure against others?
Am afraid, not at all that favourably.
Having said that, I know that his was a last minute substitute. All the more regretable, since Franco Bonsiolli would have made a wonderful Manrico had he not antagonised Herbert von karajan during the dressed rehearsal of this performance.
The rest of the cast is still less attractive.  Kabaivanska isn't bad, but the 'tremolo' of her lips were quite sufficient to drive the viewer nuts, while Piero Cappucilli's Luna has already lost much lustre by the time he reached that stage of his stellar career.
The movie is quite dark on the whole, and not really fine picture wise.
Domingo's Manrico is sub-par - his 'Ah Si ben Mio' and 'Di quella pira' are both pathetically 'under', as if he could not have sufficient stamina to go through the two big arias in a row.
Franco Corelli sadly missed.",1265760000,5,973,4.791666666666667
8040237,4,B00068NVL6,"Karajan's Verdi isn't the most exciting stuff around. However, his stuff are pretty sterling when it comes to all-rounded effect.
There are some Verdian specialists in the cast, namely Cossotto and Cappucilli. Having said that, one sadly misses Franco Corelli's Manrico, and Domingo, a last moment substitute, no way measures up to Corelli's. As a matter of fact, I would have looked very much forward to Bonisolli's Manrico. Bonisolli's voice was a true Verdian spinto that Domingo's was not at that stage of his career.
As Leonora, Raina kabaivanska's Italian wasn't truly idiomatic, nor was her style of singing, though just as Domingo, she is a great verismo soprano. As for Verdi, she pales by comparison to the likes of Leontyne Price, Leyla Gencer, Renata Tebaldi and even Mirella Freni.
Piero Cappucilli has reached the late stage of his career in this performance, and to a fairly large extent, the same holds true of Cossotto's Azucena.
The one performer who really stole the show here is the rather small role of Ferrando sung by a young Jose van Dam. If ever you wish for a wonderful opening of this opera, this one has it.",1265500800,2,1135,4.855670103092783
8040238,3,B00068NVL6,"Looking over other reviews of this performance it seems that it is the best available for this work.  Like ""Forza"" there is really no satisfactory performance available.  Composed right after ""Rigoletto"" which is dramatically viable from start to finish ""Trovatore"" has a few very difficult to stage scenes.  Given that on must look to the singing more than the acting to provide a great experience.  Things start out promising with a finely sung Ferrando by Van Dam.  But things begin to move downhill from that point on with the exception of Domingo's Manrico.  His is not a flawless performance but there are few singers in any era who can match his sense of line.  Would that all major stars had his musical intelligence.  Kabaivanka's Leonora is problematic.  The role requires a spinto voice and she is clearly a lyric soprano.  One senses her struggle with the demands of the role and fatigue in the last half produces some truly uncomfortable under pitch singing. Like Kabaivanska Cossotto is a handsome woman but much of her singing is under pitch.  I have always found her a one dimensional singer with quite a limited range in the acting department.  Cappuccilli is wooden as an actor and his voice has not much interest to my ear.  I would have cast him as Ferrando and Van Dam as the Duke.  The only other DVD I have seen of this work is the one from Verona which has the excellent Zancanaro as the Duke and not too much else.  So we are stuck with a performance which does not truly fulfill the demands of this opera.  Can we hope for a modern performance?  Probably not, for if there were five suitable singers the production would probably be one of those unbearable regieteater disasters which have ruined so many modern productions of beloved works.  Too bad.",1249776000,7,1777,4.6957928802588995
8040239,3,B00068NVL6,"Just 2 little things:
Domingo doesn't sing (if this is the write term for such an awful squeak like this!) a high C, not even a High B, but a B flat.
Kids, you don't have to have perfect pitch to notice when Manrico doesn't sing a high C, just listen if leonora's high note just after he sings ""suo figlio"" is the same...if not, they are tricking us with a transposition! Here, in this video, things are worse, because he , in this very moment, sings a A flat, not an A, and she goes a semitone down!
When RAI international used to broadcast this performance, at the very moment Domingo squeaks his high B flat, he also let us heard an equally awful rasp in his voice (he had the same problem in his Scala's 1976 Otello, at ""La, cielo, o gioia!"");TDK clearly removed this embarassing sound from this ""mythic ten(r)ror"".
Wake up!",1245888000,4,828,4.348387096774194
8040240,4,B00068NVL6,"I just watched a library copy of this and am seriously considering buying it.  It is surprisingly good.  I liked the understated acting of the chorus, who don't run around smiling and emoting in silly ways as often you see in close up on DVD operas (In the theatre it would be okay, but on video they end up looking like idiots, usually).  The acting of the principles is old-fashioned but has real integrity.  Karajan directed the production, and he has a good feeling for making a ""tableau"", especially in the finales and other big moments.  He uses actual fencers/sword-fighters effectively, putting two of them behind a scrim as lookalikes for the Manrico/di Luna duel (where they fence very quickly and excitingly to end the act), and using a large group of them very realistically attacking each other with swords at the fight in front of the convent.  The costumes and production design are also old-fashioned, but it works well most of the time and they look okay in close-up (although probably better in the theatre).

Kabaivanska doesn't seem to have an agile enough voice for some parts of the role, but she is committed.  Overall, she was good, and was really moving in her acting at times.  Domingo is dashing.  Cossotto's Azucena is the standout, though.  She is such an effective actress that the camera often lingers on closeups of her during the big moments.  Her singing is great, and she looks terrific in her big earrings and gypsy dress.

Karajan makes stage cuts, which is annoying.  Cabalette are regularly cut to one verse, and Tu vedrai amore in terra is cut, even though Kabaivanska probably could have done a good job with that.

Technical stuff: the video is grainy, and while it is acceptable on a normal sized screen, I don't think it would look good on a really big screen TV or projector.  The sound is fine to my ears.

Overall: I can't make up my mind if I should buy this or not, but I'm glad I checked it out.",1235347200,4,1945,4.607558139534884
