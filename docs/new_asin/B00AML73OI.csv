5451303,4,B00AML73OI,Nice quality in the transfer. Each episode is great. The only thing is that each episode has to be started manually.,1375056000,2,116,4.571428571428571
5451304,5,B00AML73OI,"the theme song you've heard a million times, the jazz in the background, the smoky voiced singer who's head over heals in love with our hero, mr gunn. The mood, the setting, the lighting...TV noir at its best",1366848000,4,208,4.5
5451305,5,B00AML73OI,"Lots of fun standard 25 minute episodes where the problem arises in the first five minutes. Then the answer happens in about 15 to twenty minutes and it warps up with Peter played by Craig Stevens on top of the situation in 25 minutes. Most episodes we get to listen to songs sung by Lola Albright as Edie Hart. By the way Edie most of the time stubbles on to the scene at the most inappropriate moments. Why can't she just stay in the car or home?

Peter spends a lot of time hanging around Mom's place ""Mothers"" where he gets mysterious phone calls from the soon to be dead. We listen to quasi jazz tunes for the most part.

The theme song is by Henry Mancini.

It is still fun to watch and maybe fun to see the old time technology and hear antiquated speech. As for distracters complaining of quality of transfer, my DVD copy of these black and white episodes from 1958 looked much better on a large flat screen LED than the old TV broadcasts.

I you have not watched it originally it is worth adding to your cultural knowledge.",1357948800,9,1031,4.298969072164948
5451306,5,B00AML73OI,"Such an iconic detective show!  Its dialogue is as good as anything David Mamet wrote.  Created, Produced, Directed and Written by Blake Edwards.  It was the first T.V. show to be so popular because of its music.  It launched the career of its composer, Henry Mancini.",1447718400,,268,4.760869565217392

Very well done.
Great acting and characters.
Surprised it only ran 3 seasons.",1403740800,,122,4.590909090909091
5451313,4,B00AML73OI,"The Theme song does it for me.  I just love it.  This is a half hour TV detective show of long ago.  It focuses around a night club, the female singer, police detective & a variety of bad guys.  The main actor blends well in to the story line he have been put in.  It would have been better if the show was an hour instead of half an hour, but half hour shows were the standard at the time.  I am surprised that this basic show concept has not been made into an hour show.  You have the night club scene, attractive singer girl friend, cooperative  police detective & variety of bad guys.  But since an hour show similar to Peter Gun does not exist, I suggest you seriously check out this collection of interesting shows.",1397433600,2,721,4.204379562043796
5451314,4,B00AML73OI,Love those old B&W movies. Peter Gunn is one of my favorite detectives. You don't see detective stories like these anymore.,1395878400,,123,4.904761904761905

8553816,3,B00AML73OI,"I remember this show mostly because my older brother had the cool Henry Mancini score on an LP. From what I saw on an earlier DVD I bought, it looked like the entire 1st season would be a safe pick. Safe? Yes. Satisfying? Sorta. The formula Blake Edwards follows becomes apparent on Disc One. The prologue is edgy and erupts right into the stylish credits. From there we go to ""Mother's"", a hip bar where the jazz is cool and the patrons hang onto every note. Very low key. Here we meet Mother, a savvy old broad lovingly played by Hope Emerson. Unfortunately, we also meet Edie (played by Lola Albright), the band's sexy vocalist and love interest. She warbles a song or two while making googoo eyes at Craig Stevens, who's adequate at playing the well-dressed and stone-faced private eye. It's boring, bringing the thrills created in the prologue to a screeching halt. Worse yet, Lola Albright can't sing. She looks great, but her character amounts to nothing more than fancy window dressing. After all this exposition concludes, we're ready to begin again- 8 minutes into the show! There isn't much time left for Lt. Jacobi, a role Herschel Bernardi nailed from the get-go. Although the pacing is flawed and the plots are sometimes thin, it's worth the money to watch an episode every now again. If you want a 50's crime show packed with gritty punch, look for the ""M Squad"" package starring Lee Marvin.",1504656000,,1406,4.696356275303644

8553820,4,B00AML73OI,"Peter Gunn was pretty cool back in 1958, but then I was 12 years old. Watching the series today is entertaining, the theme music still cool, but sure bears a lot of questions I didn't ask when I was 12.  Is Lt. Jacoby the laziest cop in the world or what? He sits in his office, which doesn't resemble anything connected to a police squadroom, and reads a paper waiting for Gunn to come along and solve all his cases for him. How does Mother's nightclub make any money when it is smaller than my livingroom (and I live in a 1,580 sq ft house with 3 bedrooms and two baths) and she supports a trio and a singer in addition to her bartender? Lola Albright is nice to look at, but as far as a singer goes, her doing McArthur's Park would sound just the same as her singing the Stones' Satisfaction or Presley's Heartbreak Hotel. Her voice sounds like it's the same tone no matter what note she sings. Gunn, the police, the bad guys, they all drive the same make of automobile. Where the heck was GM and Ford? I still like Craig Stevens as Gunn, and the fact that the actor was married to the same woman for 49 years until her death gives him five stars in my book.",1491350400,,1161,4.183035714285714
8553821,3,B00AML73OI,Very thin story lines but great film noir feel.  Nice jazz.  Good background when you're doing something like paying the bills. M Squad had better stories...,1477612800,,157,5.0
