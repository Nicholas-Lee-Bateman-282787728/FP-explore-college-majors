The rocket park scenes were fun days, and I even snapped a candid with my Canon of Mr. Harris tucking in his shirttail as he walked!",1471564800,,260,4.117647058823529

7949210,3,B00005OSMN,When I saw this movie in the early 80's I really enjoyed it.  Seeing it again thirty something years later was nostalgic for me and I still like it.  The acting is a bit cheesy in parts and it is dated but if you enjoy the older Syfy movies such as the Ultimate Warrior or the Last Chase then I'm sure you will like this one too.  I'm a Richard Harris fan and always find him entertaining to watch.  I would just prefer to have a dvd copy if ever available.,1431129600,,457,3.989010989010989
7949211,5,B00005OSMN,"The Ravagers is one of my favorite post-apocalyptic movies.  A couple other favorites of mine from this genre are Stephen King's The Stand (1994) and  The Omega Man (1971) starring Charlton Heston.  The Ravagers is impossible to find in DVD format so I purchased the HD streaming version on Amazon, totally worth it.  The picture is sharp and clear.  I first watched the Ravagers in the theater in 1979 and later purchased a  VHS copy that I'd watched a few times.  Yeah, its a B movie but quite enjoyable.  First rate actors.",1428537600,2,526,4.641304347826087

7949213,1,B00005OSMN,"A painful experience for those who love the post apocalyptic genre... This is one of the PA films that really show the bleakness of Hollywood's imagination of what things might be... While far from an academy award winning flick, it must be taken for what it is...A crapulous straight-to-video movie!",1376438400,,300,5.02
7949214,5,B00005OSMN,"A lot of fun for those inclined to like post apocalyptic sci-fi...This was one of the first good movies in the genre that really show the bleakness of what things might be...While far from an academy award winning flick, it must be taken for what it is...A good B movie!",1371081600,2,270,4.42
7949215,2,B00005OSMN,"A question might be posed concerning the title of this Philippine film as to who the ravagers might be, since its storyline during the WWII setting in and about a convent commandeered by Japanese troops and subsequently attacked by an American (John Derek) led local guerrilla force, reveals that only the latter group includes sexual as well as military aggression in its style. Director Eddie Romero patently believes that use of dialogue adds little to a movie's sense of purpose and as with a great deal of his work, this effort is composed essentially of long scenes of various combinations of men shooting at each other, but with such as the wooden Derek and the rather untalented Bronwyn Fitzsimons as leading players, it is perhaps an advantage to let the guns do the talking.",1096070400,4,784,4.858208955223881
