8443836,5,B004VQRC8C,"Lloyd Kaufman is the mentor of Independent Filmmaking.  Like Roger Corman, John Waters, and Werner Herzog, Mr. Kaufman gives hope to the independent filmmaker.  He is, without a doubt, a true genius.",1474761600,,199,5.1875
8443837,5,B004VQRC8C,Amazing thinking at what Lloyd has accomplished.,1419984000,,48,6.0
8443838,5,B004VQRC8C,Lloyd is the man!  Although it's a little short it's insightful and helpfull information that any aspiring filmmaker could use.,1401321600,,127,5.35
8443839,5,B004VQRC8C,"Lloyd Kaufman is a loon. He's also a filmmaker, writer, and all-around decent guy. He manages, in his own twisted Castskills comedian way, to get across the fundamentals of GETTING the film made, not necessarily how to implement the ""rules"" of filmmaking such as shot selection, etc. You can study film theory all day, but this tells you how to put film theory to use.",1364947200,2,368,4.676923076923077
8443840,5,B004VQRC8C,"I've been a fan of Troma since the early 90's when I accidentally discovered the films in my local video store, so I'm a heavily biased fan in favor of anything from Uncle Lloyd. This being said, I would still suggest this to anyone with even a passing interest in making his or her own film. It's wonderful, entertaining, and well worth the cost of admission.",1333670400,2,360,4.46969696969697
8443841,5,B004VQRC8C,"Produce Your Own Damn Movie!, like all of the entries in Lloyd Kaufman's continuing ""... Your Own Damn Movie"" saga, takes us through a series of video vignettes and interviews that explore just what it takes to get your own movie off the ground and into production, even if your budget is a couple $2 bills and some loose cigarettes and change. I've been a huge Troma fan since the internal-gestation phase and this series is a pleasant insight into exactly how Lloyd and his studio have been able to make movie magic happen against the odds for almost 40 years. If you're an aspiring filmmaker, or even just a curious one, go for it: Lloyd is a candid and funny tour guide, and with interviews with the likes of David Cronenberg, Joe Dante, and Roger Corman it's a well-rounded look into how to do exactly what the title says: Produce Your Own Damn Movie!",1313452800,3,856,4.529032258064516
8443842,5,B004VQRC8C,"There are so many books and DVDds that concentrate of Directing, finally there is one that concerns the ""Nuts & Bolts"" of film making,
and that is Producing. Lloyd Kaufman uses his Hollywood connections to get interviews with some great big Hollywood stars like Eli Roth, Stan Lee, and James Gunn to name just a few. These guys have all produced their own movies and tell you about all the mistakes and triumphs that they went through in order to get where they are today.
Lloyd offers his own advice from his 40 years of film making, adding a more down to earth and independent aspect of Hollywood.",1313452800,3,599,4.555555555555555
8443843,5,B004VQRC8C,"i'm a big fan of Troma Entertainment, and after seeing this DVD, a fan of their business model and Lloyd's ""can-do"", persistent attitude. It's not just for nerds who want to produce campy, over-the-top slashers, it's full of really helpful advice for just about anyone who wants to produce a film on a shoestring budget. Tips on how to raise money and weasel your way into doing something that is typically intimidating. Highly recommended, with some excellent and down-to-earth interviews with the likes of horror greats David Cronenberg, Roger Corman, Joe Dante, etc...",1313452800,2,571,5.150537634408602
