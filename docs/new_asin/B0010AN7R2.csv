8237472,1,B0010AN7R2,"This appears to be an excuse to depict as many gross-out forms of shooting and stabbing human beings as is possible in 75 minutes. Dead bodies pile up in Rockaway NY but no cops seem to exist in this silly pulp action film with no plot other than a march to the death by an Afgahanistan vet bent on avenging his girlfriend's stabbing. He gets his eyeballs poked out with a sharp knife by one of the many bad guys, but barely bleeds, manages to walk away and then, later, to singlehandedly shoot everyone else dead while blind! Great concept. Do not waste your time on this unless you like watching unrealistic scenes of bullets blasting huge chunks of human flesh.",1230854400,2,664,4.4958677685950414
8237473,5,B0010AN7R2,"As a rule I don't advocate violent movies but I have to make an exception with `Rockaway.'  Not only will you be impressed with Mario Cimarro's acting but as the feared drug lord character JuJu he'll have you in stitches.  As he gives orders to kill and in the same order tells his goons to be careful! Keep their eyes on the road and not touch any buttons in his car.  You find yourself hoping he does a complete turn around and become one of the good guys.

The movie is packed with lots of actions as a soldier is send home from Pakistan after they give him the news that his wife had been murdered by the drug mafia.  One by one and single-handedly the brave soldier takes them down.

I highly recommend this movie; you won't be sorry....",1213401600,3,742,4.264285714285714
8237474,5,B0010AN7R2,"Always on the lookout for foreign indies, I rented this movie first, then, after seeing it, I bought it.  The quirky, ironic, downright surreal dialogues, especially those involving ""bad guy"" JuJu, kept me laughing.  The bizarre humor is clearly intentional.  This movie does not take itself too seriously, and often lovingly mocks the genre to which it is an homage.  Some of the cinematography, the converstations between characters, and the graphic-novel-type violence reminded me of Tarantino's work.  Yes, it's a revenge story that's already been done, but what hasn't? Yes, it is graphically violent, but in a rather Dali-esque way. The characters, and especially the performance by Mario Cimarro, the Cuban telenovela star known to many Latino viewers, who plays JuJu, elevate this B film to something special and well worth watching. More than once.  Cimarro, as JuJu, is superb in his portrayal of a rather complex, yet oddly likable, even sensitive, bad guy.

If you're a Hollywood snob, this film might not be for you.  But if you like quirky, ironic, cult-following-suseptible B movies, this one is for you.  Definitely a worth watching more than once. And definitely worth owning.",1213401600,2,1193,5.204188481675392
8237475,5,B0010AN7R2,"Not if you have a sense of humor!  With one of Mario Cimarro's finest performances, it's definitely worth checking out.

Sure, the story has been done, but hey, what story hasn't been done?  If you like seeing the good guy get back at the guys who done him wrong, and don't mind some lovely body part destruction, then I can recommend this movie for you.

Just watch it!",1213315200,2,370,4.397058823529412
8237476,5,B0010AN7R2,"It's not for everyone but I was positively surprised by this little B movie star!!! You definitely must have a sense of humor (the movie doesn't even try to take itself seriously), a bit of twisted humor, and if on top of that you like irony and actually enjoy suspending your disbelief, I think you will love this is a great little jewel!!! If you like Tarantino flicks, you ought to like this. Its almost like homage to Tarantino. One of the badguys is ""JuJu"", a popular Latino t.v. actor who was the reason I watched this. His performance was truly enjoyable and everyone I recommended this movie too loved him, even if they weren't into the Tarantinoesque violence xploitation. Its a revenge fantasy about a soldier who goes to combat in Afghanistan and then brings ""war"" to the streets of Coney Island. The violence is transformed into almost graphic novelesque depictions, so it isn't ""gore"". It is, however, rampant throughout. Not for the faint of heart. But I laughed like crazy throughout this movie and the characters were able to get me to invest in them, even though they were also a joke on contemporary stereotypes. I thought this movie was sharp, intelligently done, artistic. That along with its  low budget and a born to be B movie cult classic. So if you like Hollywood or consider yourself to be a cultural esthete, you probably will be offended. But if you like wacky stuff and like to try something new, I think you will like this movie alot. It is perfect to pop in on a late weekend night to unwind, on a regular basis. Keep it next to your copy of 'Evil Dead' collection and Reservoir Dogs.",1213315200,6,1615,4.588235294117647
