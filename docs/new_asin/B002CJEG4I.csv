8364029,5,B002CJEG4I,"I highly recommend this DVD; I like all the performers.  My 2 favorite performers are Roby Lakatos and his orchestra, and Rodolfo Mederos.  One of the pieces performed by the Lakatos Orchestra features the Cimbalom prominently, an instrument which I'd previously heard, but had never before seen played.  Rodolfo Mederos plays the Bandoneon, and I was deeply moved by his playing.  I liked all the performances on the DVD, however,  A good 148-minute listening experience, which I recommend.",1491177600,,491,5.243589743589744

A friend gave us a wrong title of the DVD, that we were listening at her office.
Anyway, I am happy with the service of Amazon for this shopping.
Thanks.
