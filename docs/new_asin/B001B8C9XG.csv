8282202,5,B001B8C9XG,"I have vol 1 & 2. I am a video DJ and will throw them in now and then for fun. Some do actually show full breasts with nipples so I cant show those in bars on karaoke night but most have pasties. They are black & white and vintage and thats what makes them funny.
If you need these type of videos then get both volumes and enjoy.",1388793600,3,329,3.782608695652174
8282203,5,B001B8C9XG,"Charles Keating's Perversion for Profit is a survey of then-available pornography, and an attempt to link it to the decline of culture and to the depravity of youth.

As far as Government Propaganda goes, this is among the best available.  A vehement diatribe against pornography, Perversion for Profit even goes as far as linking pornography and the Communist conspiracy.  It's a perfect example of the Politics of Fear that is so prevalent in today's society.

I would buy this DVD just for this extra.",1215129600,3,504,4.964285714285714
8282204,5,B001B8C9XG,"Vintage Erotica (Burlesque Edition) Vol. 2 is a fantastic second installment of Triad Productions Vintage Erotica series.  Revisit American Erotica Cinema's Age of Innocence... Male fascination with erotica is probably as old as intelligent human life. The invention of cinematography was, of course, a giant stride forward. Before World War II, ""stag films"" were already a popular and firmly entrenched underground entertainment genre.

This collection contains some of the Stag Film Era's greats:

Two Bells for Virginia - The famous Virginia ""Ding Dong"" Bell with her amazing 48-24-36 measurements.  Virginia Belle's 48 inch bust is amazing.  In this clip, she dances to La Traviata.

Sandra Storm - Big busted with great rhinestone tassels, Sandra Storm strips to near nudity.

Scarlett Knight - Petite brunette with a cute bust.

And many more...

Bonus:

The compilation also includes Perversion for Profit, a 1965 propaganda film financed by Charles Keating and narrated by George Putnam. Taking an anti-pornography stance, the film attempts to link explicit portrayals of human sexuality to the subversion of American civilization, and briefly draws a parallel between pornography and the Communist conspiracy.  Perversion for Profit illustrates its claims with still images taken from various soft core pornography magazines of the period.",1214179200,10,1348,5.623762376237623
