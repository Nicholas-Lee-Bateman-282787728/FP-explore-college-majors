I was able to garner from those 2 Nintendo games and a brief history of the character in an old issue of Nintendo power. When I saw the TV series on Anime Network 2 years ago I became a fan after the first 5 episodes. A new episode came out about every week but I couldn't wait that long so I went out to buy the 2 animated movies (The Professional & Queen Bee) and Volumes 1 & 2 at the store. I'd been looking for Volumes 3 & 4 so I just got them here on Amazon and it worth the wait.
Like most great anime characters, Golgo 13 has an extraordinary ability that makes him endearing to fans of the genre. In his case, superhuman sharpshooting skills & a very sharp awareness of everything around him that makes him the greatest sniper/assassin who ever lived. However, he's more of an anti-hero than a hero because he'll shoot anyone (good guy or bad guy) for any client (good party or bad party) for $3 million and has said that he doesn't need to hear any kind of moral justification for him to carry out any hit. So although he's often called the Japanese version of James Bond, Golgo actually has more of a moral ambiguity about him but that's what makes Golgo who he is. He's neither good nor evil; he applies his craft to whoever pays him for it and doesn't betray him. He's an assassin with a sense of honor that makes him unique.
Just don't stand behind him if you value your life.",1407369600,,1492,4.166089965397924

8506215,4,B006XDU81Y,"While Duke Togo isn't a very dynamic or likeable character, the pleasure of the anime, manga and games was the situations and the characters who are affected by the Immovable Object that is Golgo 13 as well as the impossie situations that 13 finds himself in. I'm glad that someone brought him back in whatever medium. Good collector's item for fans if anime",1354838400,,358,4.698412698412699
