The Madame Bovary also give me the water dreams.  The fighting in this film looks like it cause much pain for the people.  I ducked many times as I thought the fist may fly out from the interweb and break my cranium bone!  Watching this film made me feel of the time the foreign military injected the psycho delics into my bum hole!  My eyes flapped like two barking cheewawas!  Paul Ohlman make Sonny Chiba look like a real light in the loafers!  If you like Kung fu movie, you will not be disappointed.  I do not know who is the insane man genius behind these, but I pray he go on and make more films like this one!  Highly approved!!!!!!!!!!",1427155200,,784,4.272108843537415
8690246,5,B00Q3IUEPY,Oh my these guys have overdone themself this time!!  Fighting is so hard it felt like a fist came out of the interweb and slap me in my face!  This movie is hilarious with laughing.  The scenery is so dazzle eyed that I felt like I did when the army first tested the medicines on myself (long story).  My sides are having splits from laughing so intently.  If you like Kung fu movie you will like this.  Highly approved!!!!,1418169600,,423,4.291139240506329

It is like a group of friends got together and said ""we should make a movie,"" then actually followed through and made one. I love these types of movies, it really forces them to be creative.

Movie has a good story, a bit wacky, jokes are funny and a killer soundtrack. It looks to me that everything in this movie is original. The movie is like a spoof on The Karate kid but with a twist.

It looks like this group has done another movie, ""Your Day is Gonna Come"", according to their website, www.plungerfilms.com/
I will be checking that out soon, hopefully just as good.",1418169600,,664,4.525
8690248,5,B00Q3IUEPY,This movie is hillarious!!!!  Great quality and very professional acting. Paul Ohlman is such a hunk. I'm his biggest fan.  I love plunger films.,1418083200,,145,5.0
