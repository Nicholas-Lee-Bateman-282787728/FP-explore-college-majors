7977876,1,B00007L4KB,"It got to me quickly, which was wonderful.  I like Mary Higgins Clark because there is no vulgar language but this had a little bit so I promptly got rid of it.",1397174400,,160,4.0

7977879,4,B00007L4KB,Pretty good movie.  Not the best one of Mary H. Clark's.  This was in good condition and well packaged.  Sent in timely manner.,1280620800,,127,4.434782608695652
7977880,5,B00007L4KB,"Well, I just loved it.  Sure, it's predictable, the direction it tries to steer you in is obvious and it wasn't hard to figure out.  But the story unfolded nicely and it was richly entertaining.  I liked that there actually was a good story, and not just blood and action in every scene.  Amanda Donohoe may not be a household name but I found her performance sympathetic.  Lots of people watch mysteries not for their depth but for a chance to get out of their lives for a couple of hours.  I thought this film fulfilled that expectation quite well.",1232323200,5,550,4.45
7977881,2,B00007L4KB,"This is a soap opera mystery, complete with sudsy acting (count the rolled eyes, smirks, ""Oh, my Gods,"" and loud exhales) and sappy writing.  There is a wronged woman, a cheating husband, a black buddy (mouthing cliches),and a predictable switcheroo at the end.  Surely this production was designed for at least one of the feminist television networks.  The best that can be said it is that it contains some unintentional satire about contemporary movie makers....who think that we are all about fourteen.",1217116800,,505,5.134146341463414
