8383000,5,B002WG8U0M,I really enjoyed all the movies. some where very old classics and it was fun to watch them again. the special effects where not the best but very good for that time. worth checking out.,1379030400,,185,4.314285714285714
8383001,1,B002WG8U0M,"None of the so called SCI FI CLASSICS were watchable.  They were all old, worn out prints that were hazy and none clear like todays renderings.  I found myself fast tracking through the mess of old, uninteresting so called classics hoping to find one of some little interest, without success.  Thankfully, it was cheap and no big loss when I threw the two discs into my trash can.  The party that produced this travesty used the name Charles Bronson to hint that there were big name stars contained within, not so.  Charles Bronson played some real ham fat magooch parts before he hit the big time.  It is sad that the quest for quick cash so corrupts people that they dig deep into what should have been left buried in the past to bilk people of their hard earned money.  This offering is no different than most of the ten or twenty disc sets out there that are just plain junk.  The last one I purchased had twenty discs and only one movie had a big name actor, all the rest were Italian westerns, visual torment at best.  I threw the whole mess in the garbage with a sigh of relief to get rid of them.  DON""T BUY THIS TRASH, IT ALL JUNK AT BEST!",1371772800,2,1148,4.297674418604651
8383002,4,B002WG8U0M,I only remembered a few of them.  Seeing some favorite actors as young people was great-and then watch the TV and see them all grown up.,1359158400,,136,4.230769230769231
8383003,5,B002WG8U0M,"I always love the movies I get from
amazon.com I have never been unhappy with my purchases, I love it, love it love it THANKS DEBRA",1340582400,,131,4.076923076923077
8383004,1,B002WG8U0M,"Most of the items on the disk are so compressed they show artifacting at any screen size, sound horrible for most. Since everything on here seems to be public domain, you are better off doing a web search to find better quaility. Don't waste you time and money on this crap, like I did.",1291766400,6,286,4.314814814814815
8383005,5,B002WG8U0M,"Get this one jerk gave this a 3 star rating,stating he had not seen it yet?This is loaded with great stuff for the money,I did watch it,and at twice the price I would rate it 5.",1284249600,3,177,3.9444444444444446
8383006,3,B002WG8U0M,"This set packs over 30 hours of ""classic"" Sci-Fi movies and shows on to 2 double sided disks, I wasn't expecting much from this set because the price was soo low, but I have been pleasantly surprised to find the prints are half way decent and watchable, not great, but not bad at all for so much content for so little.",1283731200,5,318,4.229508196721311
8383007,3,B002WG8U0M,"I haven't seen this yet, but I felt some clarification is in order regarding the contents of this set.  The name says 25 SCI-FI CLASSICS, but it should be pointed out more clearly in the description that this does not mean these are all films.  Many of the programs included are from the excellent half-hour television series ONE STEP BEYOND, which premiered just before TWILIGHT ZONE.  Here is a better run-down of the contents:

THE FILMS (15):
Horror of Spider Island, The Wasp Woman, The Atomic Brain, Cosmos - War of the Planets, Menace from Outer Space, Prehistoric Women, The Amazing Transparent Man, The Lost Jungle, Mesa of Lost Woman, Killers from Space, Phantom from Space, The Astral Factor, The Galaxy Invader, Hercules Against the Moon Men, Hercules and the Captive Women

ONE STEP BEYOND (10):
The Dead Part of the House, The Dark Room, The Night of April 14, Epilogue, Earthquake (David Opatoshu), The Last Round (Charles Bronson), To Know the End (Mickey Shaughnessy), The Trap, Legacy of Love (Norma Crane), Rendezvous

The Films are mostly from the 50s, and a few from the 60s and 70s.  Most of them are really for fans of ""so-bad-they're-good"" films, especially SPIDER ISLAND - Whoa!  The ONE STEP BEYOND episodes are actually really entertaining, if you understand ahead of time these are little tales of weird happenings with no known explanation.

All in all, for the price, this isn't a bad collection to get for someone in the right mind set.",1283472000,19,1467,4.859437751004016
