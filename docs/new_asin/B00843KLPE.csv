8524947,5,B00843KLPE,"I watched WWII in Colour (narrated by Robert Powell) on Netflix but was disappointed that it was not available for purchase on Amazon.  However, I did find the entire thirteen episode series on Ebay for $21.42 (new and sealed).  It is a 4 DVD set and is region 2, but it plays fine on my computer.  This is an incredible series as it covers almost everything about WWII and has beautiful maps.  Now it appears you can buy it on Amazon. This is the same set I purchased on Ebay.",1529971200,,477,4.266666666666667
