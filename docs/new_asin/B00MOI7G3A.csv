Andrews Blu-ray Review: Looney Tunes: Back in Action  The Movie is a frantically paced, densely populated farce in which beloved cartoon characters interact with Hollywood stars, cheerfully describes itself as a smack down between those long-running rivals Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. But the real Warner Bros.' stable of animated characters, some of which date back more than 70 years, against mild-mannered actors like Brendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman.

It is no contest, the animated characters always come out on top. Because the actors have to adjust their rhythms to perform in a film that has the breathless momentum of an avalanche of a Saturday morning cartoons. Steve Martin, as the Dr. Evil-like Mr. Chairman, who runs the monstrous Acme Corporation, begins to match his animated adversaries in flair. And even then, you have the uneasy feeling that Steve Martin is straining to parody Mike Myers.

Animated characters, of course, have every advantage over humans. They move at the speed of light, have more sharply defined personalities, and are ageless and indestructible. No matter how often Daffy Duck is smashed flat as a pancake (and it happens with pleasing regularity), he rises up seconds later, as noisy and frenetic as ever. And who could compete with Bugs Bunny, the unshakeably cocky, carrot-munching rabbit who talks in the smoothed-out argot of a 30's Hollywood gangster? Not even Daffy Duck, it turns out. Simply by flashing his buck-toothed grin, Bugs steals every scene in which he appears. The Looney Tunes cartoon shorts have never been known for their concentrated attention spans, and that looniness is one of their charms. Stretched out to 90 minutes, a movie that relies on sheer dizzying speed to camouflage its inconsistency can be exhausting to watch.

Although the film has a plot as such, that story is half-smothered under the tonnage of pop trivia. Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny are two feuding contract players for Warner Bros. Pictures. When Daffy Duck is booted out of the studio by its jargon-spouting vice president of comedy, Kate Houghton [Jenna Elfman], and a security guard, DJ Drake [Brendan Fraser] who dreams of being a stuntman, is summoned to escort him off the lot.

Daffy Duck forces himself into DJ Drake's for life, and they go on a search for DJ Drake's father, Damian [Timothy Dalton], an international superstar who, in addition to playing a James Bond-like spy, happens to be a real-life intelligence agent. Damian is searching for the much-coveted Blue Monkey Diamond, a legendary bauble with the power to turn people into monkeys. The Chairman also covets the diamond, which would enable him to rule the planet by turning everyone else into monkeys.

Looney Tunes: Back in Action  The Movie is so jam-packed with pop cultural references that it may be Hollywood's ultimate example to date of a film cannibalising. James Bond, Austin Powers, 'Star Wars, Mission: Impossible and the Mummy franchises are all heavily raided. By the end of the film virtually the entire stable of Looney Tunes characters, including Porky Pig, Yosemite Sam, Wile E. Coyote, the Tasmanian Devil, and Marvin the Martian, have put in appearances.

But when this mad dash of a film pauses to catch its breath, it has a moment or two of pure cinematic wonder. The wittiest feat of magic is the Louvre sequence in which Daffy and Bugs gleefully hop in and out of famous paintings, including the Mona Lisa and ''The Scream'' by Munch. The cheeky juxtaposition of Great Art and Pop Art has a breezy humour that's missing from the rest of the film.

But words ultimately have little to do with the kind of laughter to be gleaned from Looney Tunes: Back in Action  The Movie. The essence of its fun lies in the slam-bang banana-peel pratfalls and mishaps that only cartoon characters and classic clowns can sustain. Looney Tunes: Back in Action  The Movie has just enough of it to hold the attention of modern day children, but will whole heartedly amuse the older generation who like me, love and cherish the Looney Tune Cartoons.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Because of his experience on the film of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, cinematographer Dean Cundey was assigned to shoot the live-action part of Looney Tunes: Back in Action  The Movie. Given the elaborate compositing work required to integrate the animation, it is not surprising that the film was finished on what was then still the relatively new procedure known as a digital intermediate. So with this Warner Home Video 1080p encoded Blu-ray was probably sourced from the same master that created for the inferior NTSC DVD 2003 release, which would account for its smooth but detailed surface, which has to strike the right balance between the relatively simple textures of the animated characters and the more complex surfaces of the real world. The colours are subtly shaded, so that the dull tones of the corporate boardroom at both Warner Bros. and Acme Corp. transition easily to the bright, glittering neon of Las Vegas and densities and saturation look appropriate for this Blu-ray.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Looney Tunes: Back in Action  The Movie Blu-ray audio is given a breath of fresh air with its 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio that enhances the film. Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and other cartoon friends run, drive, fly, crash, explode and generally do all the physically impossible things for which they are known and loved. The main actors do more than a few such stunts as well and the sound designers have used the expansive dynamic range of modern digital sound and the steering potential of discrete multi-channel systems to open out the possibilities of Looney Tune antics without betraying the spirit and sensation of the original adventures. The voice work is impressive, and it's all intelligible, except when it's not supposed to be. Sadly, the score for Looney Tunes: Back in Action  The Movie is the last one credited to the late and brilliant movie music maestro Jerry Goldsmith, although parts of it had to be completed by John Debney.

The stage is set for a battle of wits, not to mention various forms of weaponry, most of which tend to backfire hilariously on Dodgers.

Warner Bros. Looney Tunes Cartoon: The Whizzard of Ow [2003] [1080p] [4:3] [7:10] The short begins with a magical battle between two different stereotypes of sorcerers (a short Gandalf-like wizard that holds a large book of magic in one hand and a staff in the other, and an elegant but sombre Doctor Strange-like warlock with a black cat on his shoulder) where they zap each other until they kill each other in a final energy blast. Their possessions, however, escape unharmed and fall on Wile E. Coyote, just as he was about to catch Road Runner, causing considerable pain to him (especially the cat, who viciously scratches to his face out of fear). Coyote notices the ACME book of magic and becomes delightfully happy (as his ears fall off), as he now has a new weapon against the Road Runner.

By the time he leaves with a sum total of $8,042,123,297.55, Sam is down to his last quarter. After reprimanding a group of cheaters, he notices that lucky medals, four leaf clovers, horse shoes, or rabbit's feet are not allowed, and realizes he's been duped. Sam phones Bugs, who is atop the now empty dam, to tell him, ""I hate you, rabbit."" Porky ends the film with his usual ""That's all folks!""

Warner Bros. Looney Tunes Cartoon: Museum Scream [2003] [1080p] [16:9] [7:00] Rummaging around in the trash and starving for food, Sylvester overhears Granny talking to some school children in a museum about one of the last tweety birds remaining in existence. He just spotted his prey.

Original Theatrical Trailer: [2003] [480i] [16:9] [1:32]

Finally, We will never know what Looney Tunes: Back in Action could have become if Joe Dante had been allowed a totally free hand, but what we could have deserved slightly a much better result than the back of the hand that Warner Bros. gave it at the time. Especially among the supporting players and in the margins of the frame, there's a lot to appreciate, and the Blu-ray treatment is certainly excellent. While nothing can compare to the classic Looney Tunes of old we all so love, despite this situation I am still honoured to have this in my Blu-ray Collection, as I am a real sucker for the Warner Bros. Looney Tune Cartoons. Highly Recommended!
