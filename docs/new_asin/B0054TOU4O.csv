4570882,1,B0054TOU4O,"I watched this DVD at the request of my cousin who thought it was wonderful. OK, so we MAJORLY disagree on this point. This is a 45 minute movie painfully stretched to over two hours! What a waste of time it was!

This movie had no real plot. The story line was totally predictable. The people (I could not call them actors) merely and flatly SAID their lines, the acting was nonexistent.

My history buff husband found many historical anachronisms as the movie's historical time line did not correspond to actual history events

Although the message of faith in Christ Jesus as the only way for salvation and abstinence of alcohol was the obvious intent of the movie makers, this message needs to be kept in the realm of preaching and teaching. The message is excellent and needful, the movie--terrible.

The ending was sweet although like the entire movie, totally predictable, and I liked the fact that it finally DID end! The only good thing about this movie is that it is very family friendly. Let the kids watch it. You have better things to do!",1329696000,3,1051,4.634408602150538
4570883,2,B0054TOU4O,"I thought this movie had a lot of potential at the beginning.  It started out as a good, clean, Christian, family oriented film.  Baseball in the 1920's.  Something that the whole family could watch and enjoy.  Not that this is a film that the family can't enjoy, but this movie took a sidestep, and went off on a deep tangent about alcoholism, and how drinking alcohol, even 1 sip, was so very wrong, and such a bad sin.  I can understand how it might be wrong to drink in over abundance, but this movie went on and on, harping on how bad alcohol was, and that a 'good Christian' should stay far far away from it.  Instead of enjoying a good clean baseball movie, I was being lectured repeatidly about the theme of how drinking is wrong and bad for you.  Very misleading.  They should have changed the title to Milltown Drunk, and people describing the movie and what it is about should give the potential viewer a warning about how the movie harps on alcholism.  I was very distracted with this underlying theme, circulating throughout the entire movie, and felt it took away from baseball in the 20's, a lot.",1328659200,2,1111,4.487562189054726
4570884,5,B0054TOU4O,"Good historical perspective, filmed on locations where the story could have happened.  Professionally done by a dedicated Christian team.  Story well written and actors did a great job of bringing to life.  It was interesting seeing some people I knew in the film in cameo rolls.",1326499200,2,279,5.021739130434782
4570885,2,B0054TOU4O,"The sound track of Milltown Pride is lovely, and the cinematography is outstanding. In fact, it ranks among Unusual Films' best work in these ways. The historic contextual detail is remarkable and admirable. However, apart from these things, this movie is a real disappointment. The script is simplistic, at times contrived and too predictable, and the characters are shallow and uni-dimensional (e.g: ""Well, she's a hugger..."" the main character's best attempt to describe his mother). Beyond that, it contains such a watered down version of the gospel that it barely counts as an attempt to actually express it. The excerpt of the Billy Sunday sermon (along with Homer Rodeheaver's song leading), while delightfully well executed and realistic, comes closest to dealing with the subject, but mostly focuses on Sunday's personal testimony rather than a real telling of the gospel story and what it means to be born again.

BJU has never shied away from having a strongly stated, clear-cut message of salvation in its productions in the past, so I have no good explanation for why the Dean of the School of Fine Arts allowed it to go forward into production, let alone act in it and produce it. I expected better, and am so disappointed after having bought the DVD and watched it for myself, that I wouldn't even consider showing it to my lost family members. It would absolutely fail as an evangelistic device.

There were so many opportunities missed, so many scenes that could have been more than they were, and that could have had a substantial spiritual impact; yet every single time the script writer finds a way to escape sending a spiritual message. I am baffled at why there were so many of these lost opportunities in a film that runs well over two hours, but they were numerous.

Furthermore, as I interpret its conclusion, the moral of the story is you can get saved, sort of apologize to your parents for wronging them, give up  your vices, and God will let you do whatever you really want to with your life as long as you fit Him into your spare time. The final frames are a graphic that presents John 3:16--their one clear, unequivocal presentation of biblical truth. I'm guessing they knew the weak testimony the film presented and were trying to redeem it a bit in the end with something of substance. Ineffectual, unsubstantial, and deeply disappointing--these are words I never expected to be saying about something from Unusual Films, but here they are nonetheless.",1325376000,5,2485,4.881516587677726
4570886,5,B0054TOU4O,"My family and I really enjoyed Milltown.
It is a well-written and acted movie-
Inspiring and well worth adding to the Christian movie collection!",1322438400,,145,5.083333333333333
4570887,5,B0054TOU4O,"I really enjoyed the simplicity of the story.  It was a great production and the Billy Sunday portrayal was very believable.  Was disappointed that the end was not possible.  The hero came up to bat in the wrong order for a true baseball game.  Since there was not a double switch he would have been the ninth player to bat after his insertion into he lineup, he was eighth.  But other than that it was great.",1322179200,,409,4.328947368421052
4570888,3,B0054TOU4O,"I thought this movie had a good salvation message.  And a few other ones people need to hear. Billy Sunday preaching was the best part of the movie. This is a good family film but not as good as Sheffy. It needed some better acting. But, Will the main character and his girlfriend did a good job.",1314921600,2,296,4.192982456140351
4570889,5,B0054TOU4O,You need to add this new release to your collection.  It's a film your entire family can enjoy!  Great story and impressive attention to historical detail.,1314316800,3,155,4.923076923076923
4570890,5,B0054TOU4O,"Milltown Pride is a great Christian film the whole family will enjoy! The production facilities of Unusual Films have been producing top notch ministry films for decades.  Reading the negative commentator prior to this writing, the person obviously has issues and they spew forth in that posting. Why should you watch this film?
1. It is a wonderful story, well written that gives the glory to Christ.
2. It is a great interest into the past of America and baseball.
3. The message is great, it hits an issue of its day which can be interpreted as any current issue, i.e. drug abuse, immorality, gambling etc.
4. The Lord is using the film to being scores to a saving knowledge of Christ!

That being said, the synopsis is a boy, Will Wright growing into manhood who wants nothing more than to play baseball.  He wants it so much that he sacrifices his character and testimony to fit in and play the game. Later, he finds that Christ can free him from his drive to master his own life, which is falling apart rapidly, and become more to him than Will Wright could be for himself.  It is a great film with I believe a sub theme of the film is accepting others no matter what the social structure.  Another great sub theme is that being religious doesn't mean you're right with God.

There is a wonderful scene of Billy Sunday preaching, this is a treat because Sunday was hardly recorded audibly and made very few appearances in film as this medium was just beginning to record sound at the end of his ministry.  What people tend to forget is that in this time period, America had values, morality, decency and respect, these qualities shine in a 21st century world where just the opposite reigns all about.  People today need to realize that early 20th century values, morals, societal manners,church attendance, hard hitting preaching, etc. all need to be absorbed into our modern lives.  We are failing as a society because we have eradicated most traces of this and left God to be someone we contemporize and relegate as whoever we want Him to be.  The film has a clear repentance Salvation by Grace message that is so needed to be heard today.

I don't believe anyone without a preconceived agenda against BJU could really find faults like was previously posted.  There is no way a thinking person could relate all the antagonisms mentioned by the first reviewer as true.  Like so many other good Bible based Christian ministries, Unusual Films has done a superb job in representing the Lord and its reason for its productions is to spread the Gospel of Christ, making and eternal impact.

I am so pleased to recommend this film to you and your family, you will enjoy it, benefit from it and the Lord will speak to you through it.",1310601600,6,2734,4.610309278350515
4570891,1,B0054TOU4O,"According to producer Darren Lawson, the movie is intended as a ""modernizing"" of the Prodigal Son parable, but Lawson and the BJU higher-ups must have forgotten to actually read that beautiful passage. Milltown Pride, like so many BJU productions, dabbles in a kind of spiritual reductionism: externalize sin into a ""vice"" (in this case, a peculiar clear liquid which might be vodka), and equate deliverance from that vice with conversion to ""true"" Christianity.

Thus, the vast majority of Milltown Pride is spent focusing on the descent of its hero, Will Wright, from obedient, genteel banker's son to drunk, baseball-obsessed lout. Particularly troubling to Will's respectable parents is his association with ""mill folk"", who, with their grubby faces and connections with baseball and drinking, are emphatically lower class. Don't expect the movie to preach against that prejudice, though. Much the opposite: it takes for granted a society eternally split between Good (the wealthy, squeaky-clean Town Folk, who epitomize the Victorian morals BJU prizes) and Evil (the rough-and-tumble Mill Folk, who enjoy a good mason jar o' the fire water with their roast beef). Anyone who's spent any amount of time in Greenville can readily see the comparison being made.

You know how this will go. Will falls in love with a girl, but his drinking habit turns her off. He gets saved at a revival meeting, and subsequently gives up alcohol for more wholesome hobbies like playing with kids and reading his Bible. Our hero's ladyfriend approves, and the movie lurches along to its inevitable climax on the baseball diamond. Does Will hammer the winning run in the Big Game? Does Lawson, playing the part of Will's tyrannical father, overact the part with strenuous effort? Do all the actors behave as if in a Shakespeare Drama at The Globe, rather than in a historically irrelevant Christian fundamentalist production? Is anyone seen on camera of anything but the staunchest Caucasian descent? You already know the answers...",1309564800,16,2016,5.219135802469136

4570894,5,B0054TOU4O,"This movie was a throwback to the era of prohibition.  It was an interesting perspective on a bygone era for sure.  It was a pretty long movie, but was entertaining, so it went fast.  A lot of good messages were present in the movie, including not judging others based on stereotype or class.  Family friendly and clean- although it did show problems that can be associated with drinking it was presented in an educational way that would be helpful for most kids.  Worth spending an evening watching.  Loved the set and costumes of that era- it seemed very realistic.",1453161600,2,567,4.6767676767676765

4570896,5,B0054TOU4O,"This is an outstanding Christian movie about people from different economic and social backgrounds, that shows that kindness, love, forgiveness and patience can heal and uplift everyone!  It shows how so-called Christians are not always what they say, that they are. This is an entertaining movie about baseball, that also shines Jesus to others!  My 36 year old son, who loves the Lord and baseball, says that this is a five star, exciting, heart-warming movie!  I give it 5 stars, too, because it is a rare gem, that does not have any swearing in it!  This is truly a wonderful story, that will make you laugh, cry and smile, again!  This will be a hit with baseball fans and everyone, who loves to share victories in life!

I want to encourage the makers of this movie to keep producing wholesome, uplifting films, that can be rated either NR, or G.  Folks, ""G"" means it is for a general audience, not just for children!  Anyone, who buys, ""Milltown Pride"" will have a winning addition to their video collection.",1437350400,2,1015,4.694915254237288

4570900,1,B0054TOU4O,"This was not a good movie at all. My husband and I were very disappointed with this Bob Jones production. The acting was bad, the story line seemed to advocate for rebellion against parental authority, all for the sake of fulfilling this boy's dream of being a baseball star. The gospel message wasn't portrayed well at all. I have appreciated unusual film movies for many years, but not this one. Milltown Pride does stand up to its name though, for it's full of pride: for baseball. I felt that watching this movie was a waste of my time.",1381190400,5,540,4.520408163265306
4570901,5,B0054TOU4O,"I watched this movie last night. It exceeded my expectations. Kudos to all those at BJU who were involved in the production. It is a movie for all ages, with a clear evangelistic message and a plain warning about drinking alcohol and lying. Also really enjoyed the early 20th century time setting. This is a quality film.",1378166400,,321,4.649122807017544
4570902,5,B0054TOU4O,"This is definitely a film for the whole family.  Although some of the subject matter carries an adult theme (alcohol abuse / dishonesty, etc), it helps the viewer see the error of these ways and how to seek a better life and grow in their faith.  It shows that even parents have weaknesses and aren't perfect, but that the family unit is key to success in relationships.  Although the cast may not be professionals (names we have heard before) the acting and the production are very professional.  I highly recommend this be added to anyone's library.",1377129600,2,551,4.708333333333333
4570903,5,B0054TOU4O,If you love baseball you will love this. Another great family movie to watch. Very family friendly. Wheres the popcorn?,1369094400,2,119,5.0
4570904,2,B0054TOU4O,"""Milltown Pride"" is a shaky, sightly, sincere, stagy film about baseball and faith in the 1920's. An old rhyme goes, ""Shed a tear for Jimmy Brown, for Jimmy is no more; for what he thought was H2O was H2SO4."" Alas, sincerity is not enough. I wish I could give this film higher praise, because I care deeply about the message and the messengers, and I love baseball, but I can't. Concerning production values, the scenery and costumes look good. Concerning the baseball scenes, it's spotty. Sometimes the baseball looks phony and sometimes it looks okay, but the scales are tipped to the phoniness side by having the hero bat out of order in the climactic scene. I wish the script had not had him pinch run in the bottom of the eighth. Concerning the drama, there just aren't enough believable scenes, the dialogue sounds artificial, and there is too much telling instead of showing. We are told how terrible drunkenness is, but we don't really see it. We are told how poor and different the mill folk are, but we aren't really shown it. Concerning theology, some questions arise. A great deal of emphasis is put on the theme of teetotalism, but the stated goal of the film is evangelistic. It would seem that the teetotalism emphasis would be more appropriate in a teaching film about alcoholism. In this film, it seems to distract from the main theme and possibly confuse. For example, why is there so much more emphasis on teetotalism than on Mr. and Mrs. Wright's snobbery? Some might be misled into thinking that salvation from sin is a matter of not doing certain external things. Also, addressing teetotalism in a film like this makes it very likely that the subject will not be dealt with in depth. This can easily lead to being uncharitably superficial toward those who disagree. My favorite aspects are the Billy Sunday sermon, the bonus features and the use of ""Coming Home"" in the soundtrack. Wait till next year.",1359331200,3,1924,4.729166666666667
