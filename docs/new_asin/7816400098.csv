7900455,5,7816400098,Loved the movie. I think it could have had another ending where the two characters were drawn closer before the last scene.,1471219200,,123,4.636363636363637
7900456,3,7816400098,It's okay with same story regarding illegitimate heirs who want to be recognized.,1469750400,,81,5.3076923076923075
7900457,5,7816400098,"I learned a lot as I watched the main character learn about business and figuring out life. Each woman he comes to know through the years teaches him a different lesson. It was very well written and acted. Though not a comedy, really, it has very funny comedy relief and so funny that I had to pause it in order to laugh for long periods of time and not miss anything due to laughing in the funny parts. The comedy is so great it can compared to how funny Wedding Crashers was when it came out. You'll see. This one was worth buying and I'll be watching it many times and sharing it with loved ones. It is one of the best movies I have seen for acting, writing and very excellent comedy relief!",1457308800,,694,4.186567164179104

7900459,5,7816400098,"Lie to me was blank so impossible to rate it,  Wish upon a star, had problems getting it to play for each disc but when I did I enjoyed the drama even there was one part, but a small part messed up, but one expect no part messed up.  I would never purchase from that 3rd seller again, but For Lie To Me  I was pleased with the fast action taken.",1439856000,,345,3.8309859154929575
7900460,4,7816400098,I really liked this drama - I am just VERY selective about giving 5 stars.  I especially like UI (the girl - she's an awesome singer as well) - she was just so energetic and sweet.  The supporting roles were terrific and part of me wouldn't have been the least bit upset if she had ended up with David Choi.  He was good in I Do I Do but the age difference with Kim Su Nah was a bit much.  Dokgo Ma-Te took his sweet time getting around to hooking up with IU - it was worth the wait.  It was a lot of fun I highly recommend it.,1430006400,,527,3.7981651376146788
