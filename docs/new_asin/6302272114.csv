7823379,3,6302272114,"Front Row Entertainment did a horrible job of mastering the film to DVD. It actually looks like they just copied an old VHS tape onto a blank dvd SLP speed. They did not even bother to process a digital transfer from the original print. THere are certain parts on the dvd where you can plainly see the old VHS lines scrolling up and donw the screen !!! Terrible job of transferring. Please save your money and wait for a digital re-mastering of this great film whcih deserves better treatment !!! It's obvious the company just wanted to make a quick buck by keeping expenses low and  making a huge deal out of Richard Gere's early performance in his career. Therefore, I would give the dvd 3 stars event hough the films deserves 4 !",1394323200,2,732,4.462686567164179
7823380,4,6302272114,"This movie moves fast and enjoys a solid cast of

actors.

  The story deals with an NYPD detective, a New York

state trooper and a federal agent. After the mob murders

another gangster, these three go after a drug ring.

  The film shows the culture differences between the

three police agencies. The trooper's boss witholds

information from the other team members. The cop

clashes sometimes with the black federal agent. Trust

erodes and then grows. This realistic tension helps

the story.

  Richard Gere plays the straight-arrow trooper who vexes

the city cop by calling him 'sir' all the time. This may be

his first big role. Cliff Gorman is perfectly cast as the

local kid from Little Italy's streets who took his wits

into the Department to become a shrewd detective.

  In an under-stated and strong role, Don Blakely plays the

black federal agent. He surprises and annoys Gorman

sometimes. Sometimes he accuses Gorman of corruption

or incompetence. The partnership suffers. Then, they

repair it. This brings realism to the story.

  Ruth Chris steals her scene as Faye Stone, girlfriend of

the slain gangster. She smashes through the stereotype

in a moving performance, wonderfully believable and

multi-layered. Her role alone makes this movie worth

watching. She shifts from grief to anger to resignation

with skill and care.

  Ed Grover is also well cast as the slangy gum-chewing

captain in charge of the strike force.

  The grim city street scenes may annoy some viewers

who want everything to look like Southern California.

But the film shows integrity this way. Gorman is great

moving among the locals where he had grown up.

This is a New York City story, with wonderful vignettes

of that city. The writer was wise to use them.

  This is a realistic and dynamic film well worth

watching.

7823385,3,6302272114,"The subject of this television pilot is an investigation of heroin trafficking in New York City, emphasizing a law enforcement task force and representatives of its three jurisdictional elements: a City Police detective (Cliff Gorman), an agent of the F.B.I. (Don Blakely) and a New York State trooper (Richard Gere), and their efforts to bring major criminals to bay. The tale is based on a story by Sonny Grosso and the production team is responsible for originating THE FRENCH CONNECTION, with the best scenes predictably those that propel the action yet allow local colour to tinge the proceedings. At only 74 minutes, the film bounds along briskly, but unfortunately this is due in the main to a large degree of cutting that grounds many scenes without a frame of reference to join them with the flow of the plot. A fundamental cause for the failure of the pilot to be accepted is a dearth of chemistry among the three leads, with Blakely and Gere (in his first cinema appearance) somewhat lacklustre, leaving Gorman, a fine actor, properly dominant, thereby shifting the relevance of the task force operation to an N.Y.P.D. focus. Heroin missing from the Department's Property Section becomes the principal investigative target for the three thrown-together partners, and resultant political ramifications for the Police Commissioner are touched upon, but only a trace of logic seeps through, leaving a viewer asea because of the storyline's untapped potential. Various New York City neighbourhoods serve as filming locations, the customary argots enhancing the episodic character of the butchered script, with Gorman utilized effectively amid the unknowing extras supplied by Gotham. Although the climax is rushed and certainly not memorable, the cinematography of Jack Priestley is, contributing immensely to the production's potential excitement, with primarily post-production decisions crippling the piece.",1149811200,,1917,5.457912457912458

This film stars Richard Gere. It's one of those films no one has heard of, but it is outstanding. I was stunned at how good the movie actually was.
It's about a teenager who stumbles on a mob execution in progress. From there, the action starts, and never stops. You'll be on the edge of your seat until the end of the movie.
This even makes ""The Sopranos"" come alive in another plot with other players. This means you will love ""The Sopranos"" even more, and you will find a lot of their shows incorporated into this movie.
Get this film! You won't be disappointed!",1036972800,6,807,4.315789473684211
