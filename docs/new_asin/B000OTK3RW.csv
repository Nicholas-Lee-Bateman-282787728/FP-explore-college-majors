2799628,5,B000OTK3RW,"Two great movies with some of the top actors in each. They don't make movies like this anymore.

The seller resolved a problem I had, and came through with flying colours. Excellent customer service.

Buy these movies with confidence.",1348185600,,234,4.9743589743589745
2799629,5,B000OTK3RW,"I purchased the Zulu Dawn DVD in widescreen to replace the one I have for VCR which is ""formated to fit your screen;"" so you know that I really like this movie.  Did not care for Wild Geese though even though Roger Moore (The Saint) is in it.  If you want you can get the pair or just get Zulu Dawn by itself.",1341792000,,309,3.888888888888889
2799630,5,B000OTK3RW,"Two outstanding movies together at a great price. Wild Geese with it's great cast and storyline is a movie that takes place in Africa about mercenaries (soldiers of fortune)and their attempt to save an African Leader despite double crosses by their employer. DVD has great picture and sound and has some extras to boot. Zulu Dawn is definitely a must, if you have Zulu and don't have this movie your missing the entire story. This movie has an all star cast with thousands of extras, and the story of the worse defeat the British Empire ever suffered to that time. Great camera work and music, picture quality is great and sound , but very little in extras. Take my word this is a great twosome to add to a person's collection.",1334016000,8,727,4.557251908396947
2799631,5,B000OTK3RW,"Zulu Dawn, along with the original 1964 Zulu, are among the most historically accurate war movies ever made.  Even the ""mistakes"" are minor, according to every review I have read.  Both are an absolute Must See!",1328400000,2,211,4.833333333333333
2799632,4,B000OTK3RW,"The Wild Geese and Zulu Dawn are two action/adventure classics and while, by today's standards, they are a little long-in-the-tooth, they are still well made action movies, with some great and late actors, casts of thousands(not digital creations but actual people), and locations or settings that are hard to find these days. The world has moved on, as did Hollywood, so today we get a new movie or two each week, and not all of them measure up to their hype (THE #1 MOVIE OF THE WEEK!!!) Who knows? Maybe we've just been hit with a lot of slow weeks instead, but I doubt it. We're getting more hype and less quality movies so going back for a visit to some of the action classics isn't all that bad a notion. Movie snobs might not have the same opinion but hey, movies are entertainment, and if you like guy, macho movies, then these are well worth a look.
  Ah, and here's the best part, you get two of these movies for a foolishly low price!",1327881600,,945,4.394285714285714
2799633,3,B000OTK3RW,Good sound and image qualiies but no options like subtitles and other languages which wa disappointing in this time in age.,1289865600,2,123,4.904761904761905
2799634,4,B000OTK3RW,Two of my all time favorites. Wild Geese is an action adventure yarn with actors of an earlier era. Actors I remember and liked. Zulu Dawn is an attempt (not bad) to present a historical defeat of an empire's army by what were considered at the time (mistake) primative forces.,1398988800,3,277,4.56
2799635,5,B000OTK3RW,"This purchase made a very classic guy very happy when his VCR (!!!) died.

2799638,5,B000OTK3RW,Two great movies at one price. Both these movies used to get aired on T.V. years ago but now you have to get them on DVD to see them and they are both well worth watching.,1386547200,,171,3.7777777777777777
2799639,5,B000OTK3RW,"Great 2 movie pack. Was hoping to find just The WIld Geese but this 2 movie pack is perfect for a good movie night. Discs and packaging were new, no scratches or defects of any kind.",1385942400,,182,4.083333333333333

2799641,4,B000OTK3RW,Was not happy with Wild Geese but Zulu Dawn made up for the short fall of this twosome making it a good package and well worth the money and must have if you have the film Zulu.,1368921600,,177,3.810810810810811
2799642,5,B000OTK3RW,Both of these movies involve the British military..  The movie was in very good shape and both movies were very clear.,1362355200,,118,4.619047619047619
2799643,4,B000OTK3RW,"Both are excellent movies to watch.  A lot of action and realistic.  Zulu especially because it is a true story of what happen.  Wild Geese, great acting by excellent character actors.  Probably very realsitc in what took place.  A real must to see for war movie types.",1357603200,,269,4.638297872340425
