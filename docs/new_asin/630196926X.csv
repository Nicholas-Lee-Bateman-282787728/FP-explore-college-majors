389048,4,630196926X,"I've heard of this movie for years, but didn't actually see it until last week when Turner Classic Movies ran it. And it is positively stunning!! On the surface, it moves almost like a carbon copy of 42ND STREET- right up to the last-minute switch in players before the curtain goes up (although in this film, it's Dick Powell instead of Ruby Keeler). But its astringent look at trying to play Tin Pan Alley smack in the middle of the Depression gives it a very adult and tragic significance. It still has the Berkley dazzle- from the ""Shadow Waltz"" chorus girls (and electric violins) to the now-legendary ""We're In The Money"" dress rehearsal fronted by a pre-Astaire Ginger Rogers. (I was a teenager when my mother mentioned that one verse of this song was actually sung in Pig Latin- and I swore for twenty-five years that she was pulling my chain! It is easily one of the funniest and cleverest vocal interludes I've ever seen in a musical.) But the three girls implied in the film's title- Ruby Keeler, Aline McMahon, and especially the sharp, smart, and gorgeous Joan Blondell- are the best things in the movie. And Blondell fronts the sublime finale number ""Forgotten Man-"" which pays tribute to the men (and women) of WWI and the ironies which followed. The staging of it- the marching which goes from triumphant to tragic, the torchy vocal of Etta Moten (the black woman sitting in the windowsill), and the pullback shot of everyone coming downstage at the fadeout- is truly spectacular.",1067558400,12,1496,4.757692307692308
389049,5,630196926X,"If you like explosions, outer space and bedroom scenes don't bother to view this movie. But...if you like real entertainment, the glories of film that can only be greated in B/W and Busby Berkley and a slice of history--The Movie is for You!
What can you say about Berkley? The Master. Sure the premise of the movie is corney. So what else is new? Look at todays movies! It is wonderful to see the actors that went on to fame and fortune in their youth. Joan Blondell, the later whiskey voiced ""good ole girl"" character part actress, at 19 and probably her 1st and last singing roll. Great!
Ending with the ""Forgotten Man"" is a real shocker. I thought of Viet Nam vets. Yet this movie doesn't become morbid over the depression. It is there and let's deal with it. As a depression baby all this is only too real to me. The constant stream of men asking for a sandwich and a days work. Too me a wonder tour de force in a musical.
Do view this wonderful film. Don't shy away because it was made in 1933. Relax and have a wonderful family evening.",1059955200,,1043,4.326530612244898
389050,4,630196926X,"Here's something you wouldn't expect:  A film that takes the sombre topic of the Depression and turns it into a comedic musical.  Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, and Aline MacMahon star as chorus girls looking for a break as Broadway shows keep closing due to the impact of the Great Depression.  Ruby has fallen in love with a composer, Dick Powell, who turns out to be quite wealthy and able to finance his own musical.  However, his stuffy brother does not approve of the match and decides to do something about it.  A comedy of errors ensues.  The cast are all good with this kind of material, with Blondell and especially MacMahon as standouts.  The songs are dated for my tastes, although the finale ""The Forgotten Man"" still packs a punch and is well staged and performed by Blondell.  The movie has the kind of spectacle you would expect from a Busby Berkeley choreographed musical.  It's interesting to see a movie take the topic of the Great Depression and turn it into a funny and entertaining musical.  Oddly enough, it works quite well!!",1048982400,7,1046,4.697802197802198
389051,5,630196926X,"Along with 1933's FOOTLIGHT PARADE, this is the epitome of thirties musical extravaganzas! Carol King, Trixie Lorraine & Polly Parker (Joan Blondell, Aline MacMahon & Ruby Keeler respectively) are three out-of-work showgirls living together in a cheap New York City apartment. The girls are down to scotch mist and brass buttons when their rival Fay Fortune (Ginger Rogers, in a sassy performance) informs the poverty-stricken trio that Barney Hopkins (Ned Sparks) is producing a new show. Barney admits he has no financial backers, but an acquaintance of Polly's - Brad Roberts (the let's-slap-the-smile-off-his-face Dick Powell) offers to put up the money, provided that Polly is featured in the show...A true classic gem of 2Oth century film, this fascinating time capsule is guaranteed to keep the viewer enthralled until the fadeout.  Where else can you see a sexpot named Ginger Rogers warble - in giant close-ups - WE'RE IN THE MONEY - in pig latin, yet * Joan Blondell doing her eerie REMEMBER MY FORGOTTON MAN * the incredible SHADOW WALTZ & other various Busby Berkeley delights.  For trivia fanatics: the famous Long Beach earthquake short-circuited the ladies playing their neon violins during production. As Trixie Lorraine, Aline MacMahon is perfection personified: a hilarious performance, right on the money. Joan Blondell does her usual best as Carol, the true-blue gal who poses as Polly. Warren William, Guy Kibbee & Ned Sparks are all first-rate, lending the film each of their own unique personalities and playing with zesty relish. Viewers can even see silly Sterling Holloway in a fun bit as a messenger boy. They definitely don't make 'em like this anymore!",1045958400,7,1681,5.222222222222222
389052,5,630196926X,"An excellent raw musical with lots of drive and humour.  Not to the same level as 42nd Street, but great entertainment, nevertheless.  The ""42nd Street"" show(on 42nd Street) borrows from ""GoldDiggers"" and other Busby Berkeley musicals, with ""I'm in the Money"" being a big number. So, if you liked the show it leads directly to Goldiggers.  Recommended.",1013472000,4,352,5.140350877192983
389053,5,630196926X,"This movie is great in that it shows what our culture was like in the 1930s-At the beginning of the film a very young Ginger Rogers does an amazing ""We're in the Money' and even does a whole verse in 'Pig-Latin'-who today even remembers talking like that?
Great dance sequences-maybe considered somewhat hokey with all the kaleidescope effects-but after our country was just coming out of the great depression people needed stuff like this.
Also a lot of work went into these musicals and they are simply worth it just for the costumes and  art decco alone even if you don't like the plot.",1005868800,6,589,4.663461538461538
389054,5,630196926X,"So Ned Sparks promises chorus girls Aline MacMahon, Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell, and Ginger Rogers in this wonderful pre-Code movie about mounting a successful Broadway show during the height of the Great Depression. This is really two shows in one: The first concerns the aforementioned mounting of the show, with music and lyrics by likeable but mysterious Dick Powell, Ruby's new boyfriend. The second, and my favorite of the two, is how Dick's older brother and legal guardian, banker Warren William, arrives in town to pay off Dick's girlfriend. Trouble is, when he and friend Guy Kibbee arrive at the showgirls' apartment, they mistakenly believe Joan Blondell is the squeeze. This is where she and Aline decide to take the two swells for all their worth, like any self-respecting golddigger would have to. Expert comedic scenes follow as the two big businessmen are putty in the hands of the chorusgirls.  This is the first time I  ever saw Warren William, and when he puts the moves on Joan Blondell, I knew I had to find more movies with him. Losing his Boston reserve through too many drinks, he tells her he loves her, holding her with such passion as he kisses her that all her resistance melts away--this is the sexiest celluloid kiss I've ever seen. He's just  incredible.  And all this is in addition to Harry Warren's great score, including the naughty ""Pettin' in the Park"" , megahit ""We're in the Money"", romantic ""Shadow Waltz"", and the grand finale piece, ""Remember My Forgotten Man"", a paen to the fate of the WWI vets now on breadlines and living a Depression tramp's life.  Consider ""Golddiggers of 1933"" as a time capsule back to the Great Depression's frothiest comedies--open and enjoy!",995760000,58,1711,4.886206896551724
389055,4,630196926X,"Although a musical about chorus girls in the Great Depression, ""Gold Diggers of 1933"" truly adds to the viewers' understanding of what life was like in the early 1930s.  The opening scene is inspired -- and is a sly  take on the role of women and their worth; ""We're in the Money""  not only features Ginger Rogers singing backwards, but visions of young  women adorned with coins and moneybags in interesting places.  Other  numbers are even more racy: ""Pettin' in the Park"" is quite frank  for the time period.  Yes, the story is simplistic and ends happily, but  the desperation of the characters -- despite their pluckiness -- and the  implication of a life of prostitution if the next chorus job doesn't come  along, make this a special film.  It's worth it to see a very young Joan  Blondell's torch song, ""The Forgotten Man"", end the movie and the  ""show""; it will bring tears to your eyes.  My film and history  students have loved this film!",952732800,2,949,4.626506024096385

389125,5,630196926X,"I just love these classic movies. Gold diggers of 1933 is my favorite.
The Forgotten Man number at the end of this movie just stunned me.
It shows men marching off to war flanked by cheering people waving
 American flags. A little later the men are coming back from war
and nobody is there. The men are all bleeding and bandaged and one
is being carried in a stretcher dead. Nobody cares. After you watch this
movie be sure to watch the bonus feature about why this number was in the movie.
 It is on the same disc and is quite amazing. Are the people who made
this film in 1933 trying to tell the people of today something? The brothers
who owned the studio tried to break all the rules in the movie code book
when making this film as a protest against censorship. This was one of the
last films back then to ever do that. The crackdown after this film was the
end of anything in a movie that was not approved by the censorship board.",1492905600,2,935,4.217877094972067

389128,5,630196926X,"I really enjoyed the 1930s Busby Berkeley collection. There were even a couple films I'd not heard of til now, such as Gold diggers in Paris and Hollywood hotel, and I've been a fan of 30s and 40s films for a while. My favorites out of the collection are Gold diggers 33 and 35, Footlight parade, and Dames. Least favorite, Hollywood hotel and Varsity show. But what I'm saying is my favorites are fantastic and least favoritrs, just ok. The Busby musical numbers in most of these films are just amazing. They just don't makem like they used ta.",1483574400,,545,4.515151515151516
389129,5,630196926X,"Busby Berkeley was an innovative choreographer and director with lots of dazzling style on full display in many of his films.  The 9-Film Collection has the very same DVD movies as the 5-Film Collection, plus 4 more films; both include the additional Busby Berkeley Disc, which has the cream-of-the-crop, amazing production numbers from these films and others.  Compare and contrast:  9 includes 4 films that are good films of the era, but they are not necessarily directed and choreographed by Berkeley.  For example, Varsity Show, has only 1 number staged by BB, the finale.  And the BB work is not as splashy as the choreography in the 5 collection.  So, the best of what you look for in BB is in the 5 box; the 9 box has good films with very good transfers, but not much of Berkeley's best work.  If size is a consideration, then be aware that the 9 box (with all DVDs in one box) is about 1/3 the size of the 5 box, which showcases each movie in it's own full-size DVD box.  The DVD labeling varies within the 9-Film Collection.  The five repeated films (of 5 box) are exactly the same style (silver or gray background with black or silver graphics only, no images); the 4 new films (in 9 box) have very nice labels with images and color.  Thus, Turner Entertainment does not provide a consistency of presentation in the larger box.  All films have bonus features that consist of short films (like Charlie McCarthy), featurettes, newsreels, and cartoons of the era, some of which include the music from the film they are with.  Only one bonus did not work for me; on Gold Diggers of 1937, ""Speaking of the Weather"" would not play.  Otherwise, the extras are fun inclusions.  The sleeve of the 9-box is better designed; it has a shiny cover with a BB ""dame"" on it.  If you want to know exactly what Berkeley did in each film (direct, stage finale, etc.), see Wikipedia, Busby Berkeley.  The films rate 5 stars for transfer and special features.  The compilation disc of BB's best black and white work with Warner Brothers deserves even more stars; it contains what you watch Busby's films for--the amazing use of people (especially women) and props, the art deco stylings, the overhead shots of kaleidoscopic compositions.  (To see his best color work, see Fox's The Gang's All Here--very famous Carmen Miranda ""Tutti-Frutti Hat"" number--and some of Esther Williams' finales).  Unfortunately, the compilation disc in my order had not been seated firmly on the hub and moved around during shipment; as a result the disc suffered scratches from the hub on the DVD playing surface.  So the disc begins to stick around 40"" and stops around 57"" then it starts skipping again at 2 hours and 43 minutes.  So I am returning the set with regrets, as this disc is so great.  If you order this, and they send out the set I return, don't accept that 10th disc, if damaged, because it's the best.",1483488000,8,2887,4.652859960552268

389391,5,630196926X,"Oh man, there is great stuff here, though Berkeley's best days are at the start: things get cheaper as they go along.

For many of these films Berkeley's incredible dance numbers (is that really the right word?  It's about design and ideas, more than actual dancing, usually) are inserted into stories directed by other WB directors.  But these directors are skilled in the breathless WB action style and get fine performances from greats like Cagney and Joan Blondell.  The first 3 films are pre-code and sexier and slightly more energized than later entries.  Berkeley's directorial debut in Gold Diggers of 1935 has one of the lamer story lines, but you won't want to skip it anyway.

It's a minor quibble, but I don't understand the early '30s public's love affair with Ruby Keeler.  Yeah, she's pretty, likeable, and the kid could dance a little but her voice is weak and while her acting does improve, she's always the weakest performer on a crowed screen.

There's two excerpts from the ORIGINAL Gold Diggers musical refurbed in lush early color.  The director doesn't have Berkeley's fluid artistry, but the camerawork/editing is pretty fluid for the early sound era; the dancing/acrobatics are worth seeing.  They're tantalizing outtakes from a lost work. I want more!",1392163200,4,1277,5.009478672985782

There is a musical scene where the stage is dark and there are many women playing violins which are illuminated by attached neon lights (presumably powered by batteries) which I thought was very cool and imaginative.

389477,5,630196926X,"Gold Diggers Of 1933 is Busby Berkeley`s masterwork, assisted in no small way by the astute direction of Mervyn LeRoy, who had previously directed a number of stark, socially conscious films, such as Little Caesar (1931) and I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang (1932). Like Berkeley, Leroy's best work was at Warner Bothers and, like Berkeley, MGM would buy his contract and essentially neuter him.

This is the second of the Warners/Berkeley backstage 1933 musicals, beginning with 42nd Street and concluding with Footlight Parade. Gold Diggers is a mix of harsh realism and opulent fantasy, more so than any other musical from the Great Depression.  It jump starts in high gear fantasy mode with Ginger Rogers, dressed only in a skimpy outfit made of silver dollars (with one coin strategically placed over her crotch), singing ""We're in the money."" Rogers' handling of the lyrics morphs into a glossolalia-styled Pig Latin aria that seems like it would be more at home in a Buuel movie than a Hollywood musical. Behind her, a chorus of babes holding up undulating coins sings ""let's spend it, send it rolling along."" This is Berkeley's phantasmagoric ""F_ you!"" to the Depression. And how would you climax such an opening? With a crash, as debt collectors break up the number, taking with them every prop, every stitch of clothing and everything, leaving only a crumb, a crumb even too small for a mouse.

Next we meet up with a foursome of Depression-era women. And these are determined women, bonding together to make it through a man's world in hard times. Ruby Keeler is at her innocent best. Joan Blondell is the wide awake, street-smart wisecracker. Aline MacMahon is the shrewd, conniving skeptic, and Rogers (who is a supporting character here) personifies the word ""gold digger."" Although Rogers part is brief, she commands attention, especially in the opening scene, so much so that it is abundantly clear how and why she rose above her co-stars. Rogers could do just about anything.

Oddly (and most refreshingly), the women are the stars here. The males are merely supporting characters and are portrayed as either weak, gullible, or uptight. Without the ladies, these men are impotent, only reaching their potential when pushed by their better halves. The foursome of big city girls might be seen as the original blueprint for ""Sex in the City""`s Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda. Their nasal-toned, cynical, cigar-chomping director ( the much imitated but never equaled Ned Sparks) is looking for  a new backer to fund his Depression musical. He gets needed support when Keeler coaxes pianist-beau Dick Powell to his cause. Powell has an apartment across the way. He's a remarkable songwriter (essentially, a personification of the Dubin and Warren team), but he's also got a secret. MacMahon suspects he is a crook on the lam, but actually he's well-to-do, with artistic aspirations, hiding out from kinfolk who do not want him mixing with theater trash.

The first obligatory number of the triptych, ""Pettin' in the Park,"" is a an amorous romp with Powell and Keeler (whose dancing is still clunky). Berkeley gives each anonymous, pretty girl her two-second close-up  and contrasts that with his usual amazing overhead shot, this time taking the pattern of a kaleidoscopic snowball. Dwarf Billy Barty(from Footlight Parade) is back as a lascivious toddler (!) on roller skates whose finds his rubber ball resting beneath the pumps of short-skirted women. The women, in gartered thighs, populate an artificial landscape akin to Seurat's ""La Grand Jatte."" Barty's infantile raging libido tries to pull the veil away on a myriad of drenched women undressing. He's a second too late, and now they are all comfortably armored in aluminum chastity vests. Powell is among the frustrated gents, but not to worry, Barty has a convenient can opener and the nondescript number ends with Powell plowing his way through Keeler's metal barrier.

Back in reality (the sections directed by LeRoy), Powell's sibling, Warren William, shows up to put a once-and-for-all stop to any and all showbiz ambitions. William is aided by family lawyer Guy Kibbee, but the two men fatally underestimate Blondell and MacMahon. Blondell displays raw emotion and her expression of guilt at having mislead William is genuinely convincing. Almost as good is MacMahon, who shows no such mercy toward Kibbee.

Naturally, it all works out, but even these accomplished actors, in the dramatic bits, cannot tell the story in such a way as Berkely's numbers. ""Shadow Waltz"" is Berkeley at his most diaphanous, looking very much like a precursor to Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940). The whirling dervishes of Rumi are mutated into Aryan Venuses, each rigged with neon violin. When the lights go down, they form a giant bowing violin. As impressive as Fantasia undoubtedly is, seeing similar ideas done with such expressionistic, black and white, primitive precision, with live actors and unfathomably monumental choreography, is startling.

That leaves the final number, ""Remember My Forgotten Man."" This is Berkeley's harrowing ode to the displaced veteran of the Great War. Wisely, Berkeley cast Blondell in the role of the tough hooker with golden heart, in full survival mode. Proving to be the Zeitgeist of the film, this is Blondell's great celluloid moment. Rows of transient WW1 veterans, breadlines, and pathos-drenched housewives constitute cynical comedy as visual aria. Contrasting with the opener, ""We're in the Money"", it makes for a fascinating bookend to the Leroy/Berkeley tome. It is, perhaps, the closest film will come to being socially relevant opera.

I wasn't knocked out by Dick Powell's singing, but that was the style back then.  But I was knocked out by the beautiful girls.  Beauty and gorgeous women are timeless.
Even now, in the days of women's lib, when they want you to believe that women can do anything a man can do, only do it much better, we all know the truth.
But really, even going back to the thirties, or even before, nothing's changed.  It's still the same.  They've always tried to make us believe that every woman is really Wonder Woman, when what they actually are is just simply wonderful.
And that holds especially true for Joan Blondell.  She is a total sweetheart, and seems to fill the bill as every man's dream girl.
Plus, she seems to have been almost universally loved by virtually everybody who knew her, according to what I've read.
Hooray for Hollywood, and Long Live Women!
I hasten to add that even though I think Joan Blondell is the ultimate sweetheart, she almost had this picture stolen away from her, right under her nose, by her compatriot, Aline McMahon.

But this is a great all in one collection for a new buyer like me at a great price. I can now ditch the VHS tapes.  So I am happy. But if these films came out again with further enhancements and restorations I would buy them. Most of these current ones are not full frame. Too many heads chopped off.

All the films are what I expect while the best titles in my preferred order are 42nd Street, Footlight Parade and Gold Diggers of 33.  However the best highlight for me are the only surviving clips of Gold Diggers of Broadway made in 1929 which are  included as a bonus to the not so great Gold Diggers of 37 DVD. These clips are an absolute joy. A great rendition of Tip Toe Through the Tulips by Nick Lucas and a stunning finale full of tremendous colour and energy featuring Nancy Welford singing the ""Song of the Gold Diggers"".

Another thing I approve of this collection is the belated crediting of Clarence Nordstrom in the final bonus musical numbers compiliation disk. It puzzles me as how this singer who was the male lead in the ""Shuffle of to Buffalo"" number and one of Berkeley's best never got a credit for his performance in 42nd Street.

389505,4,630196926X,"Gold Diggers 1933"" was made in the depth of the Great Depression and there are several references to it.  There is the famous opening song ""We're In the Money"" sung by Ginger Rogers.  The whole film is full of gorgeous young ingenues dancing and singing their way four song and dance sequences choreographed and designed by the great Busby Berkeley.  The scenes are extravagant, and the girls are clad in glamorous but skimpy costumes.  The Busby Berkeley classic fantastic dance routines and musical sets are well worth the watch.

The movie has the usual thirties plot which revolves around the saying ""the show that must go on.!"" - It starts with a millionaire investor , Brad (Dick Powell), who decides to rescue unemployed Broadway talent with a new and fabulously extravagant production.  The Gold Diggers in this story are four aspiring actresses:  Carol (torch singer - Joan Blondell), Polly (ingenue - played by Ruby Keeler) , Fay (Glamour Girl - Ginger Rogers), and Trixie (the comedienne - Aline McMahon).

But the main plot is centered around a group of girls who are trying to earn a living on Broadway during the Depression.  The opening scene has some very clever choreography with gold coins as the theme.

Forget the cliched plot (We're puttin' on a show!) and rather wooden acting.
The production numbers make this.
Oddly, for this type of musical, it opens with a big production number (We're in the Money) rather than saving it for the end.  Ginger Rogers is great here.  Check out the Pig-Latin lyrics.  :-)
The mistaken identity sub-plot is amusing.  Joan Blondell shines here.
And the ""Forgotten Man"" number is stunning - poignant, meaningful, and not at all dated.  Etta Moten (why isn't she more famous?) nails it.

I watched Gold Diggers of 1933 with a good friend who said the scene where the chicks undressed nips-out while silhouetted behind the curtain raised by that creepy, psychotic baby gave him a solid twenty-first century erection, which is high praise indeed! (I betcha plenty of men in the '30s went to the theaters to see this wearing trench coats with extra deep pockets, if you know what I mean.) Gold Diggers of 1933 had toe tapping songs, likable characters, tons of exposed skin, gals that made up in gams what they lacked in melons, and good-natured swindling of randy men that'd do any modern ne'er-do-well proud.

Harry Warren went on from ""42nd Street"" to ""Footlight Parade"" and other films in the early 1930s to compose the music for an impressive array of films into the 1960s.  His list of hits are staggering--42 top ten hits (21 made it to #1, and 14 reached the #2 spot), the most hits for any composer of his generation--and he was writing music at the time when the likes of Cole Porter, Richard Rogers, Irving Berlin, and Jerome Kern (among many, many others) were at their creative heights!

We see the rich, oblivious Bostonians brazenly manipulated by the sassy, savvy chorus girls, who aren't mean or dishonest- just plain hungry for a good meal. Busby Berkeley's risqu, jaw-dropping production numbers temporarily transported a weary citizenry from their troubles, and immortal Harry Warren- Al Dubin songs like ""We're In The Money"" and ""Remember My Forgotten Man"" became powerful anthems for a desperate time, when fear itself was truly the enemy.

389547,5,630196926X,"You can spend your evening watching yet another cop show or you can delve into fabulous fun by watching this, the frothiest answer to the Great Depression.

The film begins with a huge close of up Ginger Rogers singing the ditty ""We're in the Money"" in pig-Latin (added to the film when she was overheard doing this off the set).  The chorus girls go through their Busby Berkeley routine clad only in oversized coinage and so we know we are off on quite the romp.

The next scenes provide the grit of the Depression in the form of closed theaters, out of work actresses and pilfered milk bottles, but not to worry!  There is always a song coming on, and Dick Powell, that charming neighbor across the airshaft has already captured Ruby Keeler's heart with his tunes and his smile.  Her gal pals are not buying his applesauce, but when he provides the funds to underwrite their next big show that is sure to make them all happy if not famous, well, things start looking up big time.

We are gifted with some of the best of the Berkeley numbers in this film.  The ""Shadow Waltz"" is breathtakingly gorgeous with all of those lovely chorus girls in the best Art Deco dresses ever dreamed, on their Dr. Seuss-ish set, as they play their neon violins...  Like drifting on one very snazzy cloud.  And the ""Pettin' in the Park"" number brings a whole new meaning to the question, ""How long do you stay fresh in that can?""

The singing by both Joan Blondell and the incomparable Etta Moten (for whom Gershiwin wrote the role of Bess)in the ""Remember My Forgotten Man"" finale (by Al Dubin and Harry Warren) is as good as you will find anywhere.

Sprinkled all through this is a problem that is skillfully handled by a smattering of wise cracks, high-jinks and good clean fun that will make you glad that you took a trip back in time.",1171756800,3,1822,4.490909090909091
389548,5,630196926X,"""Golddiggers of 1933"" is the second of 3 great musicals Warner Brothers released in 1933. The first was ""42nd Street"", the prototype for all backstage musicals and a dark and sombre film.  The second was this one, based on a straight play and with one theme - the Depression.  The third, ""Footlight Parade"", placed the emphasis on success, supporting Roosevelt and the New Deal.

""Golddiggers"" benefits from a really funny screenplay and the talents of the acerbic Aline MaMahon and the versatile Joan Blondell.  These two dominate the film and rightly so. Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell are back as the ingenue leads. Keeler is still clunky with her delivery of her lines and Powell is nauseatingly cheerful, but, in fairness, their parts must have looked pretty awful on paper. They both would improve. Guy Kibbee plays opposite MacMahon and they were so good together that Warner's subsequently paired them in a number of straight films. The plot is good enough to stand alone without Busby Berkely's numbers but they become the icing on the cake. ""Shadow Waltz"" is charming and pointless creating beautiful images to the lilting song.  ""Pettin in the Park"" would not have survived after the Censorship was enforced a year later and is notably venal. It is almost a celebration of voyeurism. The best of all is the number with which the film ends.  ""Remember my Forgotten Man"" is an extraordinary comment on the treatment of ex-pats, a powerful and moving political statement. Joan Blondell, the best non singer ever, narrates the lyrics and uses her superior acting skills, her body and underplayed gestures to portray a prostitute memorably. It is a great performance.

The print of the film is outstanding and the DVD comes with a generous list of extras. There is a documentary on the film ""42nd Street"" and a short on the promotion of that film which makes one thinks that the producers of the DVD made a slip up - good material, wrong DVD. Another matching documentary focuses on this film.  There are 2 short films, one of which showcases radio stars all of whom are forgettable except Sylvia Frooze, of the unusual name but excellent voice and screen presence.  The second short features Lita Chaplin, one of Charlie's wives. She has a pleasant voice too but a somewhat stiff presence and a very young Sammy Davis Jnr appears in the short with her.  The Merrie Melody cartoons are wonderful with the usual detailed drawings and great orchestrations. One features characterisations of Crosby, Garbo, Zasu Pitts, Mae West, Cagney and Blondell, Ben Burnie, Wheeler and Woolsey and others.  There is also a comprehensive set of Trailers for all the films in the series; once again, maybe this was meant to be on the ""42nd Street"" DVD.

The DVD is excellent value and even better if purchased as part of the Warner's Busby Berkeley Set.",1170374400,6,2839,4.867219917012448

What a bargain! Films like this are those my parents soaked up --- to whom I owe my own existence. This is another stunner. Frivolous and frothy with snappy dialogue, sexy as hell, and an entertaining story at one level; with an undercurrent of apprehension, yet determination to kill depression. The dance numbers are out of this world. Especially those violins and spiral dresses. Visual caviare. The opening number with Ginger Rogers is heart-stopping every time I play it, which is often. There's something about the way that Ginger punches out the lyrics that makes the spirit soar. Those girls in the money are a line-up of absolute dazzlers; the choicest selection of cuties I've ever seen, knocking spots off any modern stable of fillies. Sweet and lovely. There aren't any such, these days. Just hard-boiled graduates of feminist assertiveness courses. And the finale! Sockarooney! Hits you like a rocket. This technical virtuosity, charged with heart, kills any contemporary computer graphics stone dead. I can still hear the voices of my parent's generation expressing their disgust at the advent of the kitchen sink, and the general wallowing in self-pity, post WWII.",1159488000,3,1352,4.986725663716814

389551,5,630196926X,"The plot of Gold Diggers of 1933 echoes the usual ""let's put on a show"" backstage musical theme of the 1930s. This time the story gravitates towards 3 struggling showgirls - Polly (Ruby Keeler), Carol (Joan Blondell) and Trixie (Aline MacMahon) - eking out a living during the depression. They get a break when a Broadway producer hires them for his new show, along with their songwriting neighbor Brad Roberts (Dick Powell), whom Polly favors. But all is not well. The producer (Ned Sparks) doesn't have the cha-ching to front the show. So Brad, who actually comes from a wealthy, blueblood family, puts up the money. Another complication arises when Brad's snobby upper-class family finds out about Brad's ""slumming"". His older brother Lawrence (Warren William) shows up and attempts to sever Brad's relationships with the play and with his gal Polly.

A quick note about Dick Powell's three-part movie career. There was his more driven, more cynical persona of the war and post-war era. Then his venture into producing and directing. But before all that, during the 1930s, Hollywood featured a more impish Powell, who delivered with a smooth crooning style and a natural charisma. His Brad Roberts is quinessential Dick Powell. Ruby Keeler was a reluctant movie star and left Hollywood in 1941 to be a homemaker. Yet her star potential was obvious to everyone who saw her films and her next-door girl appeal is apparent in this movie. Joan Blondell again does very good work as the clever, sassy blonde who's true to her friends and is someone to not trifle with. Ginger Rogers is not the star here but she stands out in her cameo scenes and she does warble the classic opening song ""We're in the Money"". The story I read somewhere is that Rogers was goofing around during a break and sung a chorus in pig Latin, which director Mervyn Leroy liked and included in the film.

I particularly liked the tunes ""We're in the Money"" and ""Pettin' in the Park"". ""In the Shadows"" is a typically glitzy Berkeley production, featuring chorus girls with violins. The finale is comprised of the extravaganza ""The Forgotten Man"", the movie's 7-minute homage to the people of the Great Depression and it adds a touch of solemnity to an otherwise frivolous and carefree film. Joan Blondell conveys that number's opening soliloquy with teary-eyed sincerity and Etta Moten sings the song with bluesy conviction.

At the time Gold Diggers of 1933 was released, America was still in the throes of the Great Depression. The beleaguered masses went to the movies to be distracted for a while and to imagine a better way of life, and they came in droves for this Gold Diggers entry. And why not? It's a perfect complement of great stars, wonderful songs, and lavish, intricate Busby Berkeley choreography. It's as good as it gets.",1150502400,7,2809,4.872384937238493
389552,5,630196926X,"This film opens with a highly polished and extravagant musical number. All of the girls involved are absolutely gorgeous and wear giant coins over their scantily clad bodies. The number immediately grabs the viewer's attention. The song ""We're in the Money"" is sung by a young Ginger Rogers who delights by singing a section in pig latin. It is an ironic way to open the film because the subject is partially about struggling actors during the great depression.

The story itself centers on three actresses who room together. They are out of work because of the depression. One of them, played by Ruby Keeler, has her mind on the boy next door played by Dick Powell. She, along with her room mates played by Joan Blondell and Aline MacMahon, convince Powell to write the music for a new show they're putting on with an old friend. Powell also becomes producer.

The major number that comes from that show is ""Pettin' in the Park,"" a risqu song about, well, pettin' in the park. Powell says that he's read that exercise in the park is what he needs. The lyrics remark, ""Come on; I've been waiting long. Why don't we get started? Come on; maybe this is wrong. But gee, what of it? We just love it!"" The song proceeds to turn into a dance break with a fun little sequence. However, some parts are rather shocking for the era like the silhouettes of women undressing and the finale in which a woman's chastity belt is cut open.

The story continues. The three girls learn that Powell is actually a rich man and that his brother has been sent to stop him from marrying Keeler (who thank goodness has not been given too many lines which she could have used to ruin the film!). The girls trick the brother into thinking Blondell is the fiance and she plays a gold digger to the hilt. The scheme is fun and filled with great one-liners like, ""Aww, you're as light was a hefer- uh, feather!"" The subject of the final trick is again quite risqu for 1933. It would have never made it in the film had it been made during the production code.

Dick Powell's character is also something to marvel about. It was unique to find a mischievous grown man in films then.

""In the Shadows"" is the next big song, a typical Busby Berkeley visual orgasm. The lyrics of the song are pretty and match the costumes which are reminiscent of the fairy costumes in Fantasia. The beginning of the song is illustrated by shadows that fit the subject, but the ending roams into a less fitting but still thrilling display.

The finale, ""The Forgotten Man,"" is the most serious part of the film and is a commentary on life in the Depression. Blondell speaks the opening and she does so extremely well. She does not read the lines like a poem; she speaks them like they were her own. She seems very emotionally involved. The scenes in the song play similarly to the finale ""42nd Street"" in the film of the same name. This song is hard-hitting and should be as remembered as a symbol of the Depression as ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime"" is.",1121299200,15,3003,4.490842490842491
389553,5,630196926X,"This movie, Gold Diggers of 1933, is one of those excellent classics that time cannot render dated or corny in any way. How's about those musical numbers with that Busby Berkeley incredibly talented touch? How's about the cinematography? And how's about the casting of Ginger Rogers, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, and many more talented actors to make this film so very, very special! (Indeed, look for Busby Berkeley himself in the movie playing the role of the Call Boy!)

Although the principle plot concerns three young women desperately trying to make it during the depths of the Great Depression, viewers even today can relate to the tough economic times for many people throughout the world currently. The three young women, along with Dick Powell, try to put on a show but Brad's (Dick Powell's) older brother wants to get him away from what he feels is the cheap and tasteless world of the theater. And there's laughs, too! To keep the laughs coming there is some game playing--to the hilt! The girls convince Brad's older brother that Polly, Brad's girlfriend, is actually someone else! The girls then proceed to con J. Lawrence Bradford (Brad's older brother and trustee of his estate) and his sidekick (the family lawyer) into buying them hats, furs, pet dogs, and even a car! After many shenanigans there's a happy ending-but I won't spoil it for you here! GRIN

Meanwhile there's another plot going on--that of putting on the show so they can all become rich and famous. Of course, the numbers they perform are stellar and classic, and leave the question: how could they ever get a Broadway stage to accommodate all these actors at once in real life? But you know what? The answer is: who cares? GRIN The electric violins, fade-ins and choreography are very well done for the movies of the time and overall the movie holds your attention extremely well.

The movie ends with a spectacular number ""The Forgotten Man."" This was at the time a tribute to the World War One veterans who were now reduced to standing on breadlines for the little food they could obtain. The singing is superb, principally sung by Joan Blondell and Etta Moten. The audience sees the marching of the veterans which represents the struggles and battle they faced constantly during the war; then you see the men standing on breadlines and being chased away by police when they have nowhere to sleep but the sidewalk. I also agree with the reviewer who writes that they were reminded of the Vietnam War by this number. Very sad; and superbly done!

Other great numbers in the movie, as you may already know, are the opening number of ""We're In The Money"" and ""Pettin' In The Park,"" which was extremely racy for its time.  You will love these numbers!

The quality of the sound and image is excellent. The tape played well in my VCR. Of course, you don't get the extras you would have gotten on a DVD--can we get this on DVD, anyone? SMILE

I recommend this movie for classic film fans and fans of the numerous stars in the film. The musical numbers are excellent and every bit of what you'd expect from Busby Berkeley. This film is hard to find-for a good reason! It's excellent-buy it! GRIN",1099958400,37,3188,4.712746858168761
