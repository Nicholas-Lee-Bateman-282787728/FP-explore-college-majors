6890344,4,B00QXXWWWC,"ok, here goes:  WHAT A WOMAN!  Edith Wharton packed more into one life time than most of history's great leaders.  we all know her professional writing is amazing, but here we learn that even her personal letters, both formal & informal, are pure prose filled with insight & biting humor.  I tip my hat to the film maker for all that was packed into this extremely informative hour.  however, in fairness to the prospective consumer, I must add that the usual biographical timeline is NOT applied here.  in a biography, one expects to follow a sense of order, from point A to point B, in hopes of making sense of the subject's life choices.  plus the fact that the film is flat out & straight up SLOW.  with all that having been said, you'll visit an age-of-innocence to learn what made this exceptional woman tick.  ;)",1461283200,4,819,4.554794520547945
6890345,5,B00QXXWWWC,This is a nice compliment to Edith Wharton's books.,1459382400,,51,4.777777777777778
6890346,4,B00QXXWWWC,"Engaging and thorough, considering how much this documentary covers in a short time.  I did learn a good deal.  Enjoyed hearing Wharton's voice (from her letters) as well as seeing so many historical photos.  Also included is information about her connections and correspondence to other artists.  I have just begun reading Wharton's novels, and I found this documentary to be quite worthwhile in my getting to know the artist better.  Really an interesting woman... I enjoyed watching this documentary and recommend it to anyone interested in Wharton, the Gilded Age, and those interested in American history.",1456185600,6,610,5.3125

6890348,5,B00QXXWWWC,The movie/documentary was wonderful and just long enough.  If it was cheaper I would have bought.,1446422400,,97,5.0625

8693284,2,B00QXXWWWC,"the narration is so unpolished---especially the uncouth voice of the female narrator chosen to portray Ms. Wharton. Ms Wharton would have been horrified to hear her letters read by some nasally-voiced woman with VOCAL FRY.  All in all, this is a very unsophisticated production that does not do the subject justice",1532995200,,314,5.1568627450980395
8693285,2,B00QXXWWWC,"I've been a great fan of Edith Wharton's work for many years, and I was pleased to see this documentary about her listed. Unfortunately, it's not well done. The narration is dull and hurried at the same time. The editing is very bad. It rushes to her life in and after the First World War, and then goes back to her childhood and early adult life.  I hope a more polished bio-pic on her  becomes available because she is a wonderful American writer.",1532908800,,449,4.397590361445783
8693286,4,B00QXXWWWC,"This is a well made documentary produced in 1998. I have watched it several times and enjoy all the art work, estates,scenery,and photos included. Having read most of Wharton s works and several biographies I found the information given and the topics covered to be an entertaining visit to Edit
hs world. The only thing I dislike is the needless lack of chronological script. It was just kind of silly to keep going back to things that should have been presented earlier. Overall,very good presentation.",1532390400,,504,4.9411764705882355
8693287,2,B00QXXWWWC,"The portrayal of her character (voice only) is perhaps historically accurate, but she just sounds sooooo full of herself. I didn't think her words made her sound so haughty, but the voice does. Yuck. Insufferable. I was disappointed because I think she was brilliant and one of the finest writers in history.",1532217600,,308,4.9423076923076925
8693288,4,B00QXXWWWC,"Edith Wharton was one of the greatest authors of all time. Of all her books, I have read Ethan Frome again and again for the beautiful clarity of her words. ""But hitherto the emotion had remained in him a silent ache, veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it. He did not even know whether any one else in the world felt as he did, or whether he was the sole victim of this mournful privilege...It seemed to Ethan that the art of definition could go no further, and that words had at last been found to utter his secret soul."" Masterful and elegant writing. I enjoyed learning more about her from this documentary.",1532044800,,619,4.43859649122807
8693289,4,B00QXXWWWC,"This documentary has been beautifully put together in the manner of most all documentaries in the last two decades that have  escaped the dry lecture mode of the past and amply fill their time with many photos, paintings and in this case even old film footage and tie it together with appropriate music, all of which illuminates the spoken word. This has been greatly aided by computers that can search out tremendous amounts of material and editors who put things together seamlessly. It is also aided by relying not on a single narrator but also having an appropriate person read Wharton's letters in ""her"" voice.

The result is interesting but I found it a bit too short. Also, this is basically a biography and does not go into the novels very much at all. This made it a bit disappointing to me because I was expecting more about her works, their themes and their portrayal of the milieu in which she lived. Had I not been expecting more and had known this was basically biographical information I would not have been disappointed as it is well done. So enjoy it for what it is.",1510358400,,1083,4.577319587628866
8693290,5,B00QXXWWWC,I was astonished to find this Bio on  Edith Wharton I wrote my Masters Paper on her back in the 60's and the Professor told me there wasn't much interest in her.  How times have changed>  I loved all her books.,1485820800,,210,4.073170731707317
