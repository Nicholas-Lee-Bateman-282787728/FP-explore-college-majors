8737683,5,B016ZLY2WY,"Great Spanish musical-drama from the late 1950s.  I saw it in a movie theater in the early 1960s with my parents when I was a child.  These Spanish and Hispanic films from that era are a happy memory for me.  This film is shown on occasion on a Spanish language movie channel I watch.  The story is about a young woman who inadvertently takes the place of a famed singer en route to Argentina from Spain on board ship.  She becomes a sensation, then various incidents lead to tragedy and then happiness.  The songs are wonderful, the wardrobe is lovely, and the color is beautiful.  I don't have this Region 2 DVD release.  I would love to see a high quality Region 1 DVD released so I can buy it.  This film is highly recommended for Sarita Montiel fans.",1381017600,,755,4.374100719424461
