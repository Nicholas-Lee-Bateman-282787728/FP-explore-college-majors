2208026,5,B0007CEXTK,"Thank you God and Jesus for this wonderful heartfelt entertainment.
This is how you make good T.V.  Hollywood needs to take notice.
And Also ""Little House On The Prairy"" Is another Great Show they could
bring back too.  Good Movies and T.V.  are not what they used to be.
And most of the new stuff aint worth watching.  So I give this 5 stars!

2208029,4,B0007CEXTK,"It is pleasant to see a series of telebitchin programs oriented towards creating and celebrating *positive* human relationships.  That is particularly true with the bulk of telebitchin series emphasizing fraud and theft, poisoning and violence, such as ""Melrose Place"" or ""Dynasty"" or the pompous frippery of such as ""Frasier"" or blatant insipidity such as ""That Girl"" and all the ""comedy"" based nonsenses.

I loved Highway to Heaven when it first aired in the late 80s and unlike so many shows from that era, this one still ""rings true"" all these years later.

Michael Landon was perfect as Jonathan, the earth-bound angel on a mission to help all kinds of people in need, along with his trusty sidekick, Victor French, who was also a very good choice in his role.

Relevant, uplifting and with plenty of humor thrown in too.

2208096,5,B0007CEXTK,"highway to heaven is a multiple dvd set that has over twenty five season one episodes and the picture of Michael landon and victor French.  Please understand that I only mean harm-free intent to fans and/or anyone else touched by their work, it is just that out of curiosity, I felt compelled to check out Wikipedia entries and eerily found that both men were only fifty four years old when they died. Victor French is listed to have passed away eight weeks before highway to heaven was cancelled while mike landon passed away just 23 months after the show was cancelled. Highway to heaven the complete first season comes with multiple discs and is perfect for those who like healing shows. The first episode of the show opened with their unbelievable strong connection to get along with each other because Michael landons jonathan character is shown being accepting of marks personality even as he admits to recovering from being prone to getting into fights.",1420761600,3,960,4.853658536585366

2208146,5,B0007CEXTK,There are two versions of this season out there.  One contains more discs than the other and therefore I believe the one with more discs must compress the data less and therefore has better onscreen picture.  The other set with less discs I think squashes the data even tighter to fit more episodes on each disc and therefore the picture quality suffers.  I'd rather have more discs and a better picture.

2208157,3,B0007CEXTK,I guess with the bare bones pricing I can't complain but... I will.  The movements during most episodes is not natural.  Not sure how to explain it but it's distracting - like your watching the show through fog.  It's just really weird.  Any scene where the camera moves or follows something is when it is most noticeable.  No closed-captions.

2208181,5,B0007CEXTK,"First, before I get into this review about this DVD HTH set, I'd like to share that my wife cried loads of times watching these episodes.
Personally, this is a fantastic collection with some minor flaws that I will get into.

Review-

This DVD set includes all 25 episodes of season 1 plus a bloopers episode. While this sounds great on paper, my biggest problem with this set is the fact that the episodes aren't remastered or even bumped up in resolution. They're 480i (480p would be progressive scan clarity which means better color, more detail etc) and it retains it's original quality when aired on TV.
While I wouldn't ask for HD resolutions of 720p or 1080p (or 1080i), there's loads of ""stuttering"" frames once you hit disc 3 that look awkward.
I'd of personally preferred the production to be a tad cleaner.

With that said, this still doesn't detract my score of this DVD set. You get 5 episodes of classic HTH which you WILL NOT find on any other set for the price. (Nor would you get better resolution being that there isn't a remastered set)
The first DVD alone is a tearjerker and as you progress through discs, a tad of humor's tossed in.
There are however some edits, especially for those that remember the original episodes in their entirety.

I rated this 3 stars for the DVD set itself. I have wanted to purchase Highway to Heaven for a long time but it has been for sale at astronomical prices, so when amazon had the first season for $12.99 I jumped on it. This DVD set was put out by Mill Creek.
NO subtitles. I doubt there is closed captioned either but I have no way of knowing.  The DVD's are in paper sleeves in one big stack. My BIGGEST complaint (next to no subtitles) is the picture is DISTORTED. It looks like it was filmed widescreen and no compensation. Everything is squished down and wide, so Mill Creek really screwed up and didn't fix the ratio somehow.

Obviously this has not been digitally corrected in picture or sound.  Again, the show itself is GREAT but Mill Creek did a really crummy job on putting out this DVD set.",1370563200,3,907,4.286549707602339

2208221,5,B0007CEXTK,"Highway to Heaven has such great Values and we are so glad that we are able to view his talent and be entertained with clean T.V. shows.

We just purchased the whole seasons for HTH and we love it! We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and inspiration! Great for family time! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.

We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set individually as it was more affordable to purchase that way. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time..

So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!

Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo, Animal plant etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!

I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show and Touched by an Angel since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.

This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show!

If you are looking for more shows and T.V. like this, try Sky Angel Fave T.V. you will find so many great shows similar to High Way To Heaven and Touched By An Angel.

Happy viewing! Can't wait until the rest of the DVD's are released. We need real T.V. to come back.. We will not pay for paid for T.V. with all of the trash that is on it.

We will update once we receive all of the seasons as we have ordered seasons 1-3 because we want moral T.V. to watch.. and because we love this show.

*********update******
we received our order and all three seasons are great! Now for some real worth while T.V watching.",1344988800,5,2948,4.015358361774744

Warmly remembered as Little Joe, he went on to ""Little House"", some very good TV movies, and then this consummate series.

I remember our daughter of round 10 crying each Saturday evening when these were on. I must confess that I rarely saw them through at the time so can't comment on those reviewers who vow that the episodes here miss one or two minutes.

We are watching them now and find them absolutely marvellous, tear-inducing but ultimately very uplifting. The sound seems a little low-cut; we have to have the volume up more than, say, for series like the ""Invaders"" and the ""Fugitive"".

It's been said so many times before: why oh why can't they make these quality shows now? At least we can ignore the tide of trashy filth by watching these DVDs instead but we should all worry for the future.

I married a person who had a car accident and as a result understands another language better than English.  He does, however, understand better when there are subtitles on the videos.  To not have any subtitles makes it harder to share this series with him.  Apart from that, this was wonderful.  I remembered many of the episodes from when I watched this when they first came out, and others I didn't remember at all.  I would recommend this to any family looking to spend quality time together.  It brings up many ideas to talk about and work through.  I don't agree with everything they try to put across, but I do agree with the general idea of ""do unto others"" and ""lend a helping hand.""  For example, no where does the Bible say that a person dies and becomes an angel.  Also, the message at the end of ""A Child of God"" is completely anti-biblical.  But as I said, the ""do unto others"" and ""lend a helping hand"" ideas are wonderful to see together as a family.",1231718400,,1113,4.428571428571429

I am so thankful that it was put on DVD, so I can watch it now. I am, however,  a long time fan of ""The Little House of the Prairie"" series, and enjoyed the biography of Michael Landon that is a bonus on this DVD set.

I'm glad that I bought this, as it brought back many fond memories, and it's still as enjoyable to watch as it used to be. For those who have never seen Highway to heaven before, it is a pleasant, good-hearted series with an angel and his human friend, who journey across the US, helping people with their problems. It has a great deal of comedy and humor in it, which gives it its perfect balance of laughter and sadness. Strongly recommended for all warm-hearted people.",1154649600,5,646,4.436974789915967

2208251,5,B0007CEXTK,"If anyone can pull off being an Angel on television is Charles Ingalls, err, I mean Michael Landon. Charles Ingalls from Little House, or Johnothan Smith from Highway To Heaven. He was amazing in both roles, but I really like the thought of Landon being an Angel and Highway To Heaven is the way to go from that standpoint! Landon inspired us all as being being the most inspirational father (Charles Ingalls) on the beloved Little House on the Prairie series. But thankfully after the ""New Beginning"" aired, he decided to take his talents to his own show, Highway To Heaven. Make no mistake, this series rocks. Landon always seem to have a spirit that brings the heart home and mangages to tearjerk my girlfriend everytime he goes on-screen. Victor French along for the ride is just the icing on the cake for the series as the both of them seem to mesh as they did so well on Little House.

Landon's talents are endless as he proved for years. As he did with Little House, he wrote, produced, directed and of course acted throughout Highway to Heaven as playing an angel to help people. While some of the stories are a bit iffy, it strives with wonderful acting, tearjerks throughout and of course Landon is just fun to watch as being the perfect Angel sent down from heaven to help people cope with their problems.  While I was still very young when this series started in the 80's, I'm not aware of the edits and cuts they made for the DVD collection. But nonetheless, this is great stuff and Landon is the perfect Angel and I wish stuff like this was still on TV. This is something I want my kids to watch, and knowing this is Landon before he dies, it's just that much more touching to the heart. Victor French also died shortly after the series which is a sad ending to the series in reality, but the stay was worth everything. I guarantee Michael is an Angel right now and I'm sure he's doing wonderful deeds, because it's just the kind of person he was, a caring, loving man who just wanted people to smile. No better way than getting Highway To Heaven season 1 and 2. Thank you Michael for your talents and your eternal ability to draw a tear to my eye. You will always be remembered! Must have DVD collection, don't pass it up!",1134518400,19,2237,4.440389294403893

2208253,4,B0007CEXTK,"Highway to Heaven is a wonderful show!  A bit hokey at times, but who doesn't love a warm, fuzzy, hokey show once and a while.  This was such a great show, every one having a moral to it and lesson on how to treat our fellow man or animal.  The only disappointment is the cursing in the show.  It is gratuitous and unnecessary.  So, if you don't mind up to 7 or 8 hell's and damn's and a few ""oh my G - - "" in the episodes then I'd buy it.  For us, we'd rather not listen to it and won't purchase another season.  Such a shame, it is a wonderful show!!  I guess Michael Landon (who is one of my favorites) was trying to prove he was not really an angel and attract others by adding in the language.  It isn't needed and takes away from the show.........especially one with Heaven right in the title.  That being said.....I loved A Divine Madness and the Pilot episode.  We were all disappointed in the episode A Child Of God where a preacher states that you don't have to belive in God to get to heaven, God is not looking for recognition.  I think someone needs to re-read their Bible!",1130112000,9,1086,4.143540669856459

2208255,1,B0007CEXTK,"""Highway to Heaven"" is one of my all-time favorite television programs so I was pleased to learn about the DVD release of Season One.  Michael Landon and Victor French shared a great friendship as Jonathan and Mark and their scenes together are priceless.  It's too bad that many of them have been cut from this collection as these are the syndicated episodes of ""Highway to Heaven"".

I have two of these episodes on old VHS tapes.  When they aired on NBC-TV, the episode ""Going Home, Going Home"" was approximately two minutes longer than its DVD counterpart; ""Another Song for Christmas"" was approximately three minutes longer.  Think about this:  If each show is missing between two to three minutes and you multiply this by the season total of 24 episodes, you get the equivalent of one missing hour of programming!  And for the most part, the scenes dropped are those memorable buddy moments between Jonathan and Mark.

The syndicated episodes of ""Highway to Heaven"" closed with a tag for Genesis Entertainment.  On the back cover of the DVD box is a logo for Genesis International.  It would seem, presumably, that these are the same entity.

All I can say regarding this DVD set is that I'm glad I kept my 20 year old VHS copies of ""Highway to Heaven"".  I have scenes that others will NEVER see and that's unfortunate.  Mr. Landon's work was the best thing that ever happened to television and it should also be the best thing that ever happened to TV on DVD.  Perhaps the powers that be will release a COMPLETE season two with a bonus feature containing all the missing scenes from season one.  Now that's a collection that would earn FIVE stars!  I'll be waiting for it!",1117152000,86,1678,4.675767918088737
2208256,5,B0007CEXTK,"I love this show - I really do.  It deserves more than 5 stars!  It feels so good when the ""good"" prevails, but that doesen't mean it's kitsch.  Its not ktisch at all.  It just makes you feel good (every single series!) - it makes you a happier person.

Everyone who has a heart, will love these DVDs.  And there is a catharsis too - I have to cry almost every singel series.  I can't wait till the other Seasons come out (hopefully soon).",1115337600,6,439,4.154761904761905

My late Grandfather, my mom, and myself have shared many many times just sitting and watching, and even crying.  We need more and more shows like this to grace our televisions today.

2208258,5,B0007CEXTK,"Something you don't really find in television today...heart.  Michael Landon became a master of orchestrating stories of sentiment, feeling, and genuine love.  Ever since Little House on the Praire, he used these elements to help people to realize that there is love in a world that says there isn't.  That people DO care.

I truly believe that Michael Landon was a man creating television that was ahead of its time.  People often scoff at both series for being too sentimental.  Landon proved that there isn't any way to be too sentimental when it comes down to treating people with love and respect.

I loved Highway to Heaven when it was on television for its great, heart-felt stories...of people in need, people who felt that nobody loved or wanted them, people who felt lost and confused...Landon's Jonathan Smith and companion Mark Gordon spread a little light around to those people.

One nice thing about watching this show...you always felt good at the end of the episode.",1114905600,11,983,4.915151515151515

I have to say in all the episodes ever screened, my personal favourite episode was when Mark fell in love with Stella only to be told the sad news she was dying, but Mark didn't care, he still wanted to marry her regardless, a sign of true love.

It is sad to know both actors have now passed on, but now with the series available on DVD, I get to relive all those precious exciting episodes once again, Amazon. Com you truly have made my home Heavenly once again thank-you.",1112572800,8,781,4.27027027027027
