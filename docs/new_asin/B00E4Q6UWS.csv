8601040,5,B00E4Q6UWS,"All five movies were good, but I liked ""Where There's A Will"" the best. Has some very cute and funny scenes, Marion Ross was perfect as the aging widow whose long lost grandson is found and comes to stay with her. Has a real nice ending and moral to the story, as he changes from being a bit of a crass city boy into a caring grandson and citizen of Harmony Texas! Yee-haw! Want to see more of the same.",1504483200,,403,4.05

8601042,5,B00E4Q6UWS,I really love this DVD. Except the movie Fielders Choice. The voice sync is all off. I reordered the DVD again but the movie was still not right. However I have Fielders Choice on another DVD so I kept this one. View all 5 movies syncrinization. I love Marion Ross in Where there is a Will. The little girl in Undercover Angel is awesome and the movie is very cute. Solomon's Choice is a good movie but deals with tough family decisions and can be a little downer depending on your mood. But I recommend the DVD. Great family entertainment,1491436800,,539,4.4

Love to see young Reese Witherspoon and little Joseph Mazzello acted together as sibling.",1444348800,,245,5.3076923076923075
