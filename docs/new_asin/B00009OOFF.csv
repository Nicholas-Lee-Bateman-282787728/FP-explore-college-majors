7992079,5,B00009OOFF,"My son also has an I Spy DVD, but he likes the video because he can rewind it and play his favorite parts over and over again.
It is a very cool idea for a show and characters, completely positive.",1365552000,,197,3.95
7992080,5,B00009OOFF,I bought this DVD for my 5 year old son. He loves I Spy videos. I can actually sit & watch them- very cool!,1331078400,,107,3.5
7992081,5,B00009OOFF,"I think we owned all of them.  My 2 girls LOVED watching them.  As they get older, they can look for the ""challenges"".  The only negative is the characters voices are a bit annoying for adults.  Other than that, it is very very fun to watch.",1327363200,,241,4.173913043478261
7992082,4,B00009OOFF,"There is a lot going on in this video and my (2 year old) son seems to enjoy it!

A little bit on the annoying side as far as the way it sounds... But that's just my problem.",1226275200,,174,3.5789473684210527
7992083,5,B00009OOFF,"My son loves this video and a DVD we have from the same series.  The DVD will only play two 15 minutes episodes (there are 6 oon each DVD) before returning to the menu, there is no ""play all"" feature, but my son dearly loves the show and watches closely to spot the clues first.  There are bonus challenges (additional items to look for) that will challenge slightly older children as well.",1087776000,2,390,4.402777777777778
7992084,3,B00009OOFF,"The stories were good.  Very entertaining, but I am selling mine on Ebay because I am tired of having to start from the menu again and choosing the next story to continue evey 15 minutes.  I like a movie to play through.  It was annoying.",1074556800,2,238,4.2444444444444445
