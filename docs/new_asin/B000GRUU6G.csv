8323562,4,B000GRUU6G,"I like this guy (Jamie Humphries) he has a level approach to his teaching method and tempers the lesson with subtle humour and class. The lessons are well laid out and explainations of certain Stevie Ray trill's and bend's are given within the context of each song. He breaks down each of the solo's and rythem parts into sections that make it easy to follow. The other bonus are the Jam along full length tracks that you can watch and play along to as well.
Camera angles and sound are excellent as well as explanations of the history that goes along with the SRV legend. There's even a section on the type of guitars and different amps Stevie used to get his pattent sound. This company Lick Library has really made some grteat DVD's as of late and this SRV dvd is no exception. The other great  dvd by Jamie Humphries that i just finished was the Zak Wilde instructinal dvd this is also another good one to get as well.",1210464000,7,922,4.391812865497076
