1202455,4,B00000F4CT,"I had this movie put on tape for me when it came on tv almost 17 years ago! Every now and then I think about the movie and some of the songs and then can't seem to get the idea in my head that I grew on an Anime film! Because, I really have no passion or any like for Anime at all, but this version of Jack and the Beanstalk is soooo weird that you'd probably catch yourself watching it once....then again just maybe a little later...and then it may come as a surprize to you that you watch it cause it's such an attention catcher. And for that first person to review this movie...I'm happy to have discovered that it's going to be on DVD!!! I can't wait! I haven't seen this movie in over a decade. To whoever plans on seeing it for the first time...definately a family movie and a child attention grabber!",1111708800,,807,4.146496815286624
1202456,5,B00000F4CT,"Yes, I did say ""anime,"" because it is anime, although it dates from a time when Japanese animation wasn't ""cool"" in America yet.  This film was originally released in Japan in 1974 under the title ""Jack to Mame no Ki."" (It was directed by renowned anime director Gisaburo Sugii, whose later work would include ""The Tale of Genji,"" the ""Street Fighter"" anime movies, ""Night on the Galactic Railroad,"" and the TV series ""Touch."") The movie was dubbed into English and given a very limited release in the U.S., and unfortunately sank without a trace aside from being aired on HBO a few times over the years (which is how I was introduced to this film).  I can remember waking up early in the morning just to watch this on HBO when I knew it would be on.  The animation is quite good considering the film is now over thirty years old.  The voices in the dubbed version are also very well done.  I can also remember admiring Jack for what he did at the end of the movie... I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it.  I think what made the movie most memorable for me, however, was the songs - they're catchy and well-sung, and I still remember bits and pieces of them after all these years, especially Princess Margaret's ""No One is Happier Than I,"" which has all the makings of a pop standard (for some reason, it brings to mind the Carpenters' ""Top Of The World""), and the song Jack sings to his mother when he brings all the treasures from the kingdom in the sky back home and promises her they'll be rich forevermore.  It has been years since I've seen this film, but I would love to see it again, and I would advise you to pick it up if you're interested in an anime musical that can easily hold its own against the Disney catalogue.  ""Pokemon,"" ""Yu-Gi-Oh"" or ""Evangelion"" this is not, just pure and very well-done family entertainment that even anime-haters could enjoy.  You won't regret it.",1108512000,12,1891,4.457971014492753

This one I believe is the one I went to in the 70's though I am totally unsure.  If this is the same movie the music is quite intersting and creepy in a way.  I have read many posts and it seems this is the flick I remember.  The wedding scene is what I remember the most.  Crazy song with the princess in a weird state and Jack breaking thru glass to save her.  I went to this film at the movies quite a few times.  I loved it but it was weird and my friends and family weren't so enthused by it.  The song during the wedding even today is still in my head although I have not seen it since then on TV or tape.  I need to see it again.  This movie may be the most obscure thuing Ive enjoyed.  If you get a chance see it.",1098662400,2,885,3.7243243243243245

The music is great, especially unforgetable is the scene with the princess floating on a cloud singing ""No One's Happier than I"" because she is going to marry the Ogre, Tulip.  To this day, I still sing that song.  I have yet to get my own copy because it is so rare but I will, and I encourage anyone with kids to do so.

1202459,4,B00000F4CT,"Personally, I think this is one of the best versions of Jack and the Beanstalk. While it strays from the ""true"" version of the fairy tale, the additions are bizarrely funny and don't detract from the story. In fact, they add a new fun element to it.
  Jack's got a dog, and the magician who sells the beans is really weird. Up the beanstalk is probably the craziest part, and where the story strays the most. The giant is a huge ugly ogre, and instead of a nice wife who gets jack out of trouble, he has an insanely wicked witch for a mother. She has enchanted the entire ""kingdom in the clouds"" so that the beautiful (but anime looking) princess will marry her son (who's name is Tulip of all things), and turned the entire court into animals that cannot talk. They are the ones who help Jack defeat the giant.
  This is beautifully animated, and has some great music along with it. I doubt you will be disapointed in this hard to find version. And trust me, once you've seen it, you'll never forget it! The only reason I gave it four, instead of five stars is because I realize it won't float everyone's boat. But, I think many kids would really love it. My little brother and I sure did when I was growing up.",1061078400,17,1212,4.302631578947368
1202566,5,B00000F4CT,Its totally animated but eclectic in its own way. Its to me a darker version of this childhood story. The mother is more of a witch and the environment goes from magical to dark. The giant is not as scary as his mother. Hes more of a big oaf who is in love with the princess. The princess is drugged everyday by the witch so that she thinks shes in love with the giant and hopes to marry him soon. But Jack the little boy with help from his dog and the royals who were turned into mice try to help the princess see the reality of the situation and save her. But there is also a lot of loot involved. Will Jack go for the loot and scram or will he help the princess escape a fate worse then death so that the witch can take over the land? A great recommendation for all ages. :),1400112000,,777,3.9554140127388533

The movie is unlike any version of jack and the beanstalk ever made.  The music makes it a classic, a sadly, hopelessly obscure classic.  The current price on this is nearly $200!  Holy hell!  Several years ago I wrote on imdb.com about how i wished this movie would come out on dvd, my old vhs taped from tv had finally broken.  Hens tooth video actually contacted me to say they were bringing it to dvd!  I was so excited!  I guess it was a very limited release - i was lucky to get it when it was only about $29.

I haven't seen this since the 3rd grade!! It's a Japanese production, which means if you're a fan of anime, you'll probably like this. The story is a little weird, which is why I like it so much. The addition of Madame Heckuba as the main baddie was a nice touch. It's a musical that has a song or two from the 70s and some (I'm guessing) original stuff for the movie itself. I remember clearly the music for the scene where the mice take Jack and his dog through the castle was very amusing. Watching it now brings back good memories, and some of the songs have been stuck in my head since childhood. Very enjoyable.

However, my delight quickly turned into disappointment and rage as the English audio track was 1-2 seconds off throughout the film, so sound effects do not match up with the action on screen and the lip syncing is broken. This is simply unacceptable and completely ruined the viewing experience for me.

I would give this DVD release 1 star, except the Japanese audio is perfectly in sync. (Too bad the subtitles are ""dubtitles,"" meaning the English script--instead of an actual translation--is played over the Japanese audio.)",1322179200,3,727,4.950819672131147

1202644,4,B00000F4CT,"This is a Japanese cartoon adaptation of Jack and the Beanstalk. I don't know what it is about it, but I think I will always remember watching this film. It's not traumatizing or overly weird, I felt more hypnotized than anything while watching it. It's just like any other film, but I just re-watched it recently after about a 15 year gap of having no seen it and I was hit with huge wave of nostalgia, every line and song and movement was familiar. I thought it was just me of course as I am sometimes told that I have a very esoteric taste in... everything, but after browsing through some forums I discovered that almost everyone who watched this film when they were younger loved it intensely and it has affected them in someway or another. And as I re-watched it I'd have to say that I agree with the sentiment.

The story is a familiar one. A poor boy and his mother live in a little shack of a house trying to make ends meet when one day their cow stops giving milk. The mother sends the boy, Jack, to the market to get a decent price for it. On the way to the market however, the boy is intercepted by a man playing weird piano (the note from which I can always remember so clearly as they were so queer), who convinces him to take a handful of magic beans in exchange for the cow. His mother is furious and throws the beans out the window, and after disciplining Jack, goes to bed. In the night the beanstalk grows and a little mouse comes running down it. The mouse motions to Jack's dog of trouble up the beanstalk and Jack comes out of the house marvelling at what had grown in his backyard. Jack, his dog, and the mouse all climb up the beanstalk. When they get to the top they come out of an old well in the courtyard of a castle and see this girl standing there watching them with an oddly vacant expression. She is the princess of castle and she tells Jack of the joy she will have when she marries her beloved prince Tulip. Jack soon discovers that Tulip is a giant and that his mother is an evil witch who is trying become queen by enchanting the princess to want to marry her son. Jack then faces the dilemma of whether or not to help the princess or leave with his gold.

I enjoyed the characters a lot, but what I like about it is there are two stories going on at the same time, one involving people and one with animals. Jack can't understand what any of the animals say and he doesn't even pay much attention to them most of the time because he's busy with his own plot line and agenda, but there are animals throughout the movie and the all have very vibrant personalities. Even the audience can't understand what they're saying, but through movements and expressions you can tell what they're trying to say. A lot of story lines with both people and animals bridge the gap between them and let them talk to each other  or let the audience understand them if the people in the film don't. The animals in this film actually have their own sub-plot.

The music in this movie is captivating. It's not an award-winning score by any means, but there is just something odd about it that catches at one's interest. It's not quite unsettling, but it doesn't fade into the background either. The music is definitely one of the aspect that will draw you into the film to make you love it. The characters are good and the plot is very interesting, but the music is what will get you. The artwork too. There's just something about the movements of the characters and the setting, especially in the castle.

As I said, this isn't the best movie I've ever seen, nor is it even the best Jack and the Beanstalk story I've heard. Despite that, this is the kind of film that you'll remember after you've grown up. I don't know what exactly it is about it, but I do know that I enjoy watching it and will probably try to obtain it at some point on dvd.",1292371200,,3859,4.288065843621399
1202645,5,B00000F4CT,"HBO was a huge treat for us kids back in the 80's.  I used to watch this version of Jack & the Beanstalk all the time (I also loved watching The Pirate Movie, among many others).  The animation was fun, the storyline was both fun and trippy, and I loved the music.  I just watched it last night and all those great memories came flooding back.  My favorite parts? 1. When the vine grows and grows 2. The dreariness of the castle that fit perfectly with its takeover by Hecuba 3. Jack's song and dance when he brings home some of the riches he has found 4. The harps retelling of how Hecuba drained the life out of the kingdom 5. Hecuba cutting out the guests for the wedding and last but not least, when light finally lit the kingdom all over again.  I did cringe when Jack was being beaten with the broom by his mom though...I had forgotten that part.  All in all, a great entertainment feast for all. Some scenes might be too scary for youngsters but if they're playing today's video games, they can handle this.

1202647,4,B00000F4CT,"My dad found all sorts of great cartoons at the video rental store for us to watch growing up. This was one of them, and even to this day when I hear the name ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" this crazy, haunting movie comes to mind. Even as a kid I was no dummy, I knew they took alot of liberties with the story but I didn't really mind nor do I now. Normally I usually hate song numbers in cartoons but these are good songs...well except the dog's weird little caterwaul under the moon. That was really weird. My sister and I were always glued to the TV in the afternoon and evening after preschool/kindergarten let out and we watched this cartoon movie quite a bit. I don't ever remember being bored or having places lag in boredom, unlike suffering through Lady and the Tramp or Cinderella *ugh*. It was amusing watching the silly oaf of a Jack go off dancing, meeting that creepy dude on the road with the pipe organ, getting the seeds which his mother promptly throws out the window in anger. But then the musical number and animation of the beanstalk growing....wow, it was actually entertaining. The castle in the sky was haunting, breathtaking. Madamde Heckuva (or however you spell it)and her ugly giant of a son were creepy and downright bizarre (remember the windup toy of his mother that sang that Tulip had in his drawer?). The wedding scene had such a manic gothic song, it always kept me in suspense, wondering if Jack would get there in time to save the princess from marrying Tulip. My sister and I would laugh ourselves silly during the final music number where Jack drove Tulip insane with his antics.

Heh, good childhood memories. A truly exceptional case of taking a paint by the numbers fairytale and making it fun. :)",1281830400,,1735,4.543130990415335
1202648,4,B00000F4CT,"Ever since I viewed this slightly distorted version of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" (hereafter JATB 1974) about 32 years ago on TV during Thanksgiving or Christmas on the ""SFM Holiday Network"" (including the ""Monday Night Football"" theme song - you know, EEEEEEEE, ta-ta-ta-ta-TA!), it has obsessed my memory.  Before I bought and watched the DVD from Amazon, I could only remember bits and pieces from this extended cartoon feature, such as 1) Jack's stalwart bloodhound Crosby singing to the moon (""Crosby, you can talk!""), 2) the eerily weird wedding sequence with Princess Margaret, the giant Tulip, and the magically animated ""paper congregation"", 3) Tulip toppling some columns while chasing Jack and Margaret, 4) Tulip flicking a swordsman (the general) away with his finger, and 5) Jack's shrewish mother fainting at the sight of Tulip descending the beanstalk after Jack.  These images flickered in my mind like a dream.  Now, having watched the movie as an adult, some of the eeriness and oppressive atmosphere has diminished, but JATB 1974 is still quite a unique, compelling, and thought-provoking experience.

 As other posters have commented, JATB 1974 strongly adheres to the basic plot, except for the inclusion of Crosby, Margaret, and the thoroughly malevolent and devious witch Hecuba, also the purported mother (!) of the brutish Tulip.  In another deviation from the basic plot, after doing away with her royal parents, Hecuba has somehow mesmerized Margaret to see beastly Tulip as a beautiful prince so that she can marry him and make Hecuba ""Queen of the Clouds"".  The jazzy, theatrical score permeating the movie is a third difference, prompting me to suggest to Broadway to produce a musical based on JATB 1974.  Despite Hecuba's convoluted matrimonial scheme, JATB 1974 respects and fleshes out the classic plot, fully developing at a deliberate but lively pace all the characters and their motivations.

 For example, Jack comes across as a boisterous, cheerful, friendly kid, if a bit impulsive, self-absorbed, and nave (with the bean/cow trade and all).  His plump, widowed mother appears as a shrill, harsh termagent, but still grudgingly empathetic since we realize that her bad temper probably arises from destitute circumstances.  Crosby the bloodhound initially appears as a lazy dreamer of heroic deeds, but eventually proves himself an invaluable ally and conscience to Jack as he convinces him to accept the responsibility to save the princess from the witch and giant.  Princess Margaret evokes our fearful sympathy as we feel sorry for the loss of her parents and pray that Jack can somehow break Hecuba's sinister spell over her.  Hecuba makes for a completely seductive but hissable witch who is quite prepared to sacrifice anyone in her way (including her verbally abused son Tulip) to achieve her dream.  Even the supporting cast of Princess Margaret's court entourage (transformed into speechless mice by Hecuba) charm us with their pluck and resourcefulness as they aid Jack and Crosby in their quest.

 Even given this multifaceted cast, I still found Tulip to be the most interesting character of all because despite his seemingly simple brutish and villainous nature, he is actually a rather complex, conflicted, and even endearing being.  To me, he had aspects of the Hulk, the Beast (of Beauty and the Beast), the Frankenstein monster, and even the green ogre Shrek.  However, most of all, he reminded me of a persecuted King Kong, ape-like (longer arms than legs), fierce, and frightening, but ultimately more sinned against than sinning, and generally harmless unless provoked.  Also, like Kong, he topples from a great height to his death, a fate he does not warrant.  In other words, ""Tulip Kong"", in my opinion is not such a bad guy.

 From the beginning we meet the giant, you feel a pang of sympathy for him.  He comes back to the castle with an armload of firewood, and all Hecuba can do is berate him for being late because he probably was playing with snakes and lizards.  In fact, throughout most of the movie, Hecuba treats her son like scum.  You also come to the conclusion that Hecuba's scheme is almost entirely her own (I suspect she alone killed the king and queen, Margaret's parents) and ""Tulip Kong"" is just along for the ride.  She tells him to stop ""mooning about the castle"", which is so much nicer than the cave they lived in.  When she orders him to locate Jack, whom she placed in a cauldron to save for dinner (!) but escapes with Crosby's and the mice's help, ""Tulip Kong"" doesn't exactly knock himself out looking for him.  A really big kid at heart, he would rather seek refuge from Hecuba's rants in the treasure room and amuse himself with a caged lizard and the golden hen that lays golden eggs.  Okay, he does crush a wind-up doll of Hecuba that spews insults at him, but at that point you are inclined to be on his side.  Jack is hiding in the treasure room and almost gives himself away, but ""Tulip Kong"" allows himself to be distracted by Margaret calling for him.  In the movie, it is glaringly obvious that he loves and cares for Margaret.

 Therefore, even when ""Tulip Kong"" acts violently against Jack, we suspect he is doing so only to protect his future ""bride"".  He first catches Jack in Margaret's bedroom and understandably becomes upset, relentlessly chasing after the interloper.  When Jack interrupts the faux paper-cutout wedding and kisses Margaret to break the spell, ""Tulip Kong"", like his counterpart, understandably goes crazy, tears off his wedding suit to reveal yellow t-shirt and underwear festooned with hearts (hee-hee) and chases Jack and Margaret to get her back.  During the wedding sequence itself, ""Tulip Kong"" cradles and treats Margaret gently, and daydreams of wedded bliss with her, both of them swinging on a wedding bell (so he has shades of Quasimodo as well).  During the sequence where Tulip attempts to thrust an enormous spear into a well where Jack and Margaret are hiding, he carefully aims the spear to get at that dream-killer Jack, not Margaret.  In the main hall room, where Hecuba traps the duo with her stormy magic, ""Tulip Kong"" refuses to obey her command to trample them.  Instead, he steps on her!  It's not murder, because Hecuba turns out to be a clockwork vessel like the doll in the treasure room.  Anyway, ""Tulip Kong"", not Jack, is the one ultimately responsible for destroying the witch and making the castle and its occupants normal again. After that deed, ""Tulip Kong"" does not resume chasing Jack and Margaret or anyone else.  Probably relieved that he fulfilled his previous vicarious wish to get rid of his witch mother, ""Tulip Kong"" lounges on the front castle steps.  He resumes chasing Jack (and Crosby) a la Tom and Jerry only because they mercilessly taunt him and lure him to his death by falling off the beanstalk vine.

 Again, this death was unnecessary.  I would have preferred that Margaret had intervened and made friends with ""Tulip Kong"" in an attempt to rehabilitate and humanize him.  After all, with his tremendous strength and agility, the giant would have made a useful castle companion and defender.  Furthermore, Jack could have reconciled with his enemy and continued to visit the castle in the clouds.  Instead, he chops down the beanstalk and loses access to that magical kingdom.  A foolish decision.  By not deviating from the classic plot climax, JATB 1974 misses the opportunity to show tolerance and understanding to those we consider ""monsters"".  To paraphrase Dino DeLaurentiis, nobody cry when Hecuba ""die"", but when ""Tulip Kong"" die, people gonna cry.

P.S.:  I would like to conclude with a few observations, questions, and goofs:

1. The movie establishes that Tulip can track Jack by smell (""I smell a hu-man!"").  Therefore, when he is searching for Jack throughout the castle, why doesn't Tulip just sniff him out?

2. Tulip's size is somewhat inconsistent throughout JATB 1974.  I think he was meant to be about 20-25 feet tall (again, Kong sized).  But in comparison with the other characters, he shrinks and grows.  For example, Hecuba (about 7 feet tall, I'd say) reaches just above Tulip's knee in some scenes, and up to Tulip's waist in others. When Tulip crushes her, she probably doesn't reach above his ankles. Margaret (about 5 feet tall, I'd say) sometimes reaches up to Tulip's waist as well.  Jack (about 4 feet tall, I'd say) reaches up to Tulip's knee. When Tulip flicks away the charging foolhardy general with his fingers, he looks almost 50 feet tall!

3. Tulip is green-skinned like the Hulk.  Perhaps the chapel was green during the wedding sequence to conceal that fact.

4. Hecuba wants to be queen.  She has killed Margaret's parents.  Why doesn't she get rid of Margaret from the beginning as well, instead of going through the wedding scheme?  Okay, maybe it was to keep Tulip obedient, but during the wedding sequence, Hecuba daydreams that she becomes queen and turns Tulip and Margaret into mice!!!  Why doesn't she do that in the first place?  Did they need to be ""married"" for her magic to work?

5. Hecuba is a powerful elemental sorceress.  However, she apparently had no defense against a size 35 EEEEEEEE moccasin coming at her from above.

6. Jack uses an axe to cut down the beanstalk and send Tulip plummeting.  It takes him only one chop!  He either hit a weak spot in the vine, or he doesn't know his own strength!

7. Tulip's colossal corpse has probably left a crater in the landscape (unless he vaporized on impact) and will attract scavengers and curious townspeople for miles around.  The putrefying carcass will also stink up the land.

8. Jack brings two sacks full of gold and the magic golden laying hen back to his mother and sings a song about how he is responsible for making them rich.  However, at the movie's end, they seem as poor as ever.  Have they already spent all that money?  Has the hen ""gone dry"", so to speak?",1274140800,,9959,4.904961147638972

This animated adaptation of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is easily the best movie I have ever seen made of the fairytale.  Daringly mature and loaded with memorable songs, it is also very perceptive and heartfelt.

It also breaks the mold by taking significant creative license with the tale, and the changes wrought on the storyline are so natural that it is almost easy to criticize the original telling.  For instance, there is no poetry-spouting giant here, just a mean and frankly dumb behemoth looking to absolutely crush Jack for being in his castle and looking sideways at his bewitched bride, Princess Margaret.  Princess Margaret herself represents another departure from the traditional telling of ""Jack and the Beanstalk,"" and even adds a layer of heartache, tragedy and sophistication to this unexpectedly rich treatment.  Princess Margaret's signature song ""No One Is Happier Than I"" is drenched in bittersweet irony, and would be at home in a wide range of movies.

Also featuring a creepily maternal witch and Jack's faithful hound Crosby, this particular adaptation of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is perfect.",1270425600,,1135,5.237569060773481

The songs are great and easy remember, it has a tween twist to it, so the language is not adult but rather closer to early adolescents. How often do you see a dog like Crosby that is so laid back and loyal? Crosby and Jack make this movie! So if you're sick of the current trends in Anime, take a look at an older version of Anime.

The storyline is basic,....not hard to follow but it is wierd here and there.  The evil mother / witch (Heccuba) is almost like a robot with that human trait.  I'm giving a spolier when her giant, ogre-like son, Tulip crushes her at the end.  Certain scense and the musical score are almost Pink Floydian (ummm....Pink Freudian???? lol) here and there....but overall it is a great watch for the fans of this film as well as those who are young at heart.  I've noticed some other people making comments and indicating that really young kids shouldn't watch it for it may be....well...too trippy.  But that is done out of pure discretion.

1202815,3,B00000F4CT,"This film stayed with me since childhood, and like the reviewer below, I couldn't find any mention of it on IMDB, Amazon or anyplace else.  And now here it is, in all its DVD goodness - and what a thoroughly strange film it is, too.  I couldn't believe how much of it came back to me as I watched - it must be 25 years since I saw it last.

This is a very strange take on the standard tale.  Jack is an impulsive, impudent kid who has to learn not to be selfish, with a very funny dog who fancies himself a military man.  A creepy, possibly kiddie-fiddling musician with an electric organ tricks Jack into buying the magic beans, which grow overnight in a gorgeous sequence.  The giant is a hulking beast called Tulip, and his mother is an evil, normal-sized witch who treats him so badly you almost feel sorry for him.  There's an enchanted Princess, people turned to mice, a talking harp, a golden chicken, and some paper cut-out people...

The songs are mostly terrible, and yet weirdly compelling - especially the Pink Floyd-ish music for climbing the beanstalk and the ghostly wedding song.  ""Are you happyyyy?""  Many sequences in the film are surreal, even psychedelic, and there's a strange undercurrent of Freudian unease in the relations between Jack and the Giant and their harsh, controlling mothers.  The animation is pretty good, with some very nice backgrounds.  The Princess has a proto-anime look to her.

I'm not sure I can recommend this film to kids or not, to be honest.  It's weird and unsettling, and there's a terrible scene early on where Jack recieves a lengthy beating with a broom.  Then again, kids don't pick up on a lot of stuff that raises adult eyebrows.  For anybody who vaguely remembers it or is into funky kid-vids, it's a good party video.  Parents, you might want to watch it first before showing it to the kids.  But hey, it didn't freak me out.  Much.

SPOILER WARNING:  The image of the giant smashing his wicked, emasculating mother and finding only clockwork inside has haunted me for years.",1175126400,8,2034,4.610027855153203

1202818,5,B00000F4CT,"In the spring of 1980, when I was 4 years old, I happened to be fortunate enough to catch on television an animated feature-length re-telling of the Jack and the Beanstalk story. This one has Jack climbing the beanstalk, and instead of just encountering a giant, he encounters an entire kingdom over-run by the giant and his witch mother. The witch has placed Princess Margaret and her court under a spell, turning them into mice and making Margaret fall in love with her son, the giant Tulip. Helping Jack on this adventure is his faithful dog, Crosby. What struck me the most about this film at the time, besides the great adventure story, was the music. The film was made in 1974 and has a rock opera soundtrack that although sounds a little dated, it manages to hold up over the decades. Later, as I got older, I tried to find this film on VHS, only to be told that the film DIDN'T EXIST!!! I know I have a very active imagination, but there is no way I could EVER dream up something this good! Then one day, when my cheap father decided to finally break down and get cable, I was channel surfing WHEN I SAW THIS FILM AGAIN!! Without even thinking, I immediately began watching it...without bothering to TAPE it! I checked the cable listings to find out when it was airing again and set my VCR to record. So I finally had a grainy copy of one of my beloved films from childhood...only to lose the copy AGAIN when I went to college! Ever since then I have been on a quest to find this film. I finally found it on Amazon.com, on DVD no less, and immediately snatched up a copy. When I watched it again, I expected to see its flaws, as seen through the eyes of a 27 year old young man, not a child anymore. But guess what: I COULDN'T FIND ANY!!! This movie MORE than stands the test of time. The main theme is one of courage, as Jack decides to do the right thing and rescue the princess instead of just taking off with the gold. Also the courage of the giant, Tulip, to finally confront his oppressive mother, and crush her...literally. The good thing about watching this movie as an adult, is seeing all of the adult qualities  inherint in it, that you miss as a child. Such as the pressure put on Jack to be a man and run the house now that his father has died. And Tulip to be a man and quite letting his mother run his life. Add to all of this the music. From the opening song ""What's in the hat?"", with Jack frolicking through the woods, to the showstopping ""No One's Happier Than I"" sung by the enchanted Princess Margaret, the music ALONE deserves some sort of positive recognition. Especially the number ""Are You Happy?"". It's the wedding song sung by Princess Margaret and Tulip's wedding guests, paper cut-outs brought to life by magic, that really sends the soundtrack home. The tune is the sort of trippy, Who-inspired song that exists solely in the '70's, accompanied by  acid induced imagery, but AGAIN, it stands the test of time. I recently screened this DVD for my 5 year old nephew, who LOVED it, which further proves my point: more people should definately see this film, young and old. My goal is to one day host a big-screen screening of this film, and hopefully bring it the recognition it deserves.",1140652800,10,3223,4.415126050420168
1202819,4,B00000F4CT,"I got a tape of this a number of years back and I loved it. It's still one of my favorite ""feel-like-a-kid-again"" movies. The dubbing is not the best by far (but no 70's cartoon, American or otherwise, can really claim good voice work) and the musical numbers are either great or painful, but, taking into consideration that this is a late 70's effort at Japanese anime translation, it's great for the kids.

  The best part are the new plot elements created for the story. Rather than the castle belonging to the giant, it is actually a kingdom that has been taken over by a witch, Madame Hecuba, who is the mother of the giant. She wishes to become queen of the kingdom.  She killed the king and queen, then placed the princess under a spell so she would marry her son. Jack needs to release the princess from the spell in time to stop the wedding. Few adaptations of this story are able to create a storyline deep enough to justify a full-length production, but this one does it very well.

  Despite being a Japanese production, the magic elements are more in line with European fairy tales, which makes it easier for kids to understand than if they were taken from more Oriental-style tales, as Japanese adaptations are apt to do.

  A couple things for the PC or sensitive types to look out for, however, are that the giant, and a few creepier scenes, might scare very young children. Also (at least in the original tape) Jack gets spanked with a broom by his mother after he brings the beans home.

  Despite the fact that the production values show it's age, and the sometimes sketchy musical numbers, I still give this 4 stars for originality in its adaptation and general fun-ness.",1131494400,3,1691,4.559602649006623

1202821,5,B00000F4CT,"Like a lot of the reviewers here, I saw this film as a kid in a limited-release movie theater. I was familiar with the old fairy tale, and entranced with this slightly altered version. I recently acquired the DVD to watch with my grandson, and am even more impressed with it now than I was when I was a kid. The animation is cruder than I remembered. (I guess my memory enhanced the art over the years) But I was highly impressed with the story elements and, above all, the musical score. The songs leading up to the growing of the beanstalk are mediocre at best, but once Jack climbs the stalk, the songs take over, too. Someone else besides me noticed the uncanny resemblance between ""No One Is Happier Than I"" and The Carpenter's ""Top Of The World"". Crosby's paean to the full moon, and the creepy, sinister wedding song (Are You Happy-ee-ee-ee?, etc.) are marvelous. What is most impressive is the incongruous musical score. This film based on a fairy tale uses Rock-and-roll, jazz riffs, and the blues equally well. It takes guts to use music that is ""out-of-genre"", for lack of a better term; but when done right, with ""Ladyhawk""'s rock score, and ""The Sting""'s ragtime soundtrack for example, it can be astonishing. My sister, who obtained a DVD copy for her daughters, compared notes with me and agreed that the musical soundtrack, songs and all, is a pastiche of '70's-era rock operas.

7906874,5,B00000F4CT,"This may be the best version of Jack & The Beanstalk - ever. It takes the original story and expands on it in such an imaginative way without killing it. I wish more treatments of fairytales were as well thought out as this one.
Unless you don't know the original story there is little risk of spoiling this film by explaining some of the story. Jack, a young and naive farm-boy, must sell his family cow so he, his mother and dog don't starve. He trades the cow to an odd peddler for a handful of magic beans, his mother scolds him as a fool, tossing out the beans and in a spectacular bit of animation, the beans grow into a giant beanstalk overnight. Here is where the story begins to change. Jack climbs up the beanstalk and finds a dark and foreboding castle. He then learns that the Land of the Clouds has been taken over by an evil witch, Mme. Hecuba, and her giant son, ""Prince"" Tulip. The witch has killed the king and queen and transformed the rest of the people, except for Princess Margaret, into mice. Jack must prevent a wedding between Margaret and Tulip which will make Mme. Hecuba the rightful queen. Along the way, Jack hides in the Royal Treasury where he encounters the hen that lays golden eggs and the magical talking harp.
The story is dark but in the same way that a Roald Dahl or Maurice Sendak book is dark, rather than Tim Burton or Edward Gorey dark. The artwork and animation are gorgeous.
