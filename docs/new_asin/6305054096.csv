7882565,4,6305054096,"I first saw this movie at a film festival some years ago. Jackie Chan came personally to share some of his favorite films. I so enjoyed this movie that I have never forgotten its impact on me. Knowing that the story is  based on the true-life experiences of Jackie and his friends as children  under the care and discipline of the  Chinese Opera makes it even more  exciting to watch. The movie is full of acrobatics, make-up, and wonder.  It's an intimate portrait of the life of these children and the world they  lived, worked, and grew up in.",953078400,9,546,4.4646464646464645
