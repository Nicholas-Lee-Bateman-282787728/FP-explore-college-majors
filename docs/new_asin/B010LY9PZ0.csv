7313443,5,B010LY9PZ0,"In Boston, Gumby was featured on Rex Trailer's Boomtown. Now it's a known fact that kids will watch anything, but unlike Pow Wow the Indian Boy, the Gumby shorts were actively anticipated and never wore out their welcome. They were different from other cartoons, if you could even call them that, partly because they invented a world where small clay people and animals could cohabit with toys and books and everyday items like pots and pans - if you wanted some robots to do your chores, you just went to the place where the robots are and got a few. And your mom would remind you to return the robots when you were done with them, because that's good manners.

But there were also the very inventive and unlikely stories, where you'd explore a human-scale oven and discover a door in the back that took you to Pastry Town, where the cookies and pies talked to you and, maybe if you weren't careful, plotted to put you in a jelly roll. Yikes! Did not see that coming!

Like a lot of people I was disappointed with how in later years the Art Clokey original shorts got chopped up and re-scored and re-dubbed, in various repackaging schemes that had little respect for the relaxed pacing that made you feel like these were friends you were watching, (even if they were a green clay boy and an orange horse). And I could never watch the later series, where Gumby's facial features were crammed too close together and there were unwelcome additions to the cast of characters, which is a trap a lot of series fall into when inspiration flags.

So really, this set is all the Gumby you need to have. But I can't conclude this without mentioning something: once, only once, maybe it was an accident, but one Saturday Rex Trailer showed a very short Gumby cartoon which isn't here (as far as I can tell) and nobody seems to remember; I've never seen it referenced anywhere. It was a very chunky, crude looking Gumby, almost a Missing Link Gumby, walking around and singing ""I'm a little piece of clay, my name is Gumby..."" My brother saw it too, and we used to snicker and sing that song, because it was so primitive and unlike any other Gumby ever seen. This really happened; I'm not making it up.

One last thing,  Instead of a bendable figure, I wish they'd given you a working Gumbometer.",1443744000,21,2285,4.523002421307506
7313444,5,B010LY9PZ0,"Obviously the original show is brilliant. I want to talk about the packaging and figure, which is not described on amazon at all. The outer box has a hinged front that opens to reveal a windows that allows you to see the figure. It's much nicer than you can tell from the amazon picture. The figure inside is NOT an ordinary Gumby  that you can buy anywhere. It is a special version made to look like Gumby as depicted in the original films. I compared it to my 90's era Gumby and it is larger, with different eyes, nose, and mouth. It is definitely worth ordering this version of the DVD. Over all a very nice package!",1443571200,23,619,4.2905982905982905
7313445,5,B010LY9PZ0,"I can now scratch off one more title for my DVD collection that I would consider it to be complete.

First off, I wasn't born when the original 'Gumby Show' aired in the 50s or when the 60s version followed, instead I stumbled onto them in syndication around 1984-85 on our channel 60 at the time & have been a fan ever since and have waited for it to be done on DVD...properly. To sum this up, this set made me very happy with the end product and how it turned out.

I bought the Rhino video set of Gumby back in 2002, which visually was a great looking set both inside & out.  However, I was extremely disappointed that the audio featured on that set wasn't the original audio tracks like on my prerecorded VHS tapes that I taped off the TV back in the mid 80s.  So that was a hit against that set and then having small random volumes come out with the original audio but those were just random episodes from the 50s & 60s cobbled together to make up about 90 minutes of one disc.

I just picked up this set over the weekend and it was great to see (as well as hear) the original 50s Gumby, aside from being really affordable it gives you your money's worth.  The epsiodes look great from their remastered film original, there will be an occasional anomalies here and there but considered how old these epsiodes are, they look and sound great.

What was great for me as well is that I've never seen them in their full original 11 minute form, I've always seen them in their syndicated 5-6 minute versions.  In all honesty, I just did some research before writing this that I never realized that they were shown like this originally and then split into 2 episodes when it went into syndication.  Even watching them as a kid, all these syndicated originals were easily paired up with a very similar episode that shared a couple of scenes but had more differences from the other as well as two different titles.  IF I had one complaint about this set is that I wish both versions (original broadcast & syndication) were included in the disc since there was different animation for both title cards for split episode.

There are only a couple of special features, the original unaired pilot was cool to see.  The packaging may not be as flashy as the deluxe Rhino set that preceeded it but this packaging gets to the point and makes you know what you're getting and it caught my eye on the shelf with no problem.  Those at NCircle, great job putting this together!

Overall, if you're a fan of Gumby or you want to take a nostalgic trip or even introduce it to new Gumby fans, I'd say buy this!  It's a great, affordable set for both the young and the old.  I contacted NCircle this summer on Facebook when I got wind of these coming out and had asked about the 60s & 80s Gumby episodes and whomever responded stated that they are coming in 2016, which again made my day.  they did such a great job with these, I eagerly await the next 2 volumes so I can cap my Gumby DVD collection.",1443398400,37,2981,4.33273381294964
7313446,5,B010LY9PZ0,"All episodes are in this collection! As an avid Gumby fan, please know that all the episodes are in this collection. Original Gumby episodes are longer in length, they were split into 2 halves for syndication and given new names for the 2nd half. This may look incomplete, but all 50's episodes were restored to their original form so there are less episodes numerically, but they are full uncut and unedited as they were for later TV syndications. Gumby fans never fear, this is the only place to obtain fully restored and COMPLETE Gumby episodes, never looking better and with their original soundtracks. This is the 50's episodes only and the 60's episode set will be released next from Ncircle. Hope every Gumby fan snatches this set up, you won't regret it! Yay Gumby!!!",1443312000,7,775,4.791044776119403
7313447,3,B010LY9PZ0,"This set is good for what it is...but Im here to tell you that this set is NOT complete as several episodes are missing like ""Gumby Concerto"" Etc from the 50s.  The 50s era figure is awesome and is a must have for a Gumby fan like myself...and most of all this set has the original episodes with original music and dubs unlike the massive set released a few years ago that overdubbed everything.  My biggest gripe is that it does not contain every episode from the 50s as the packaging states.",1443225600,6,493,4.3478260869565215
7313448,5,B010LY9PZ0,"This series really took me back to my childhood. Although I wasn't born when Gumby first aired, I remember watching the show as a young child. This one is fully re-mastered with the original 50s soundtrack and is just like the classic claymation cartoon that I remember. There are not a lot of special effects and modern day bells and whistles but if there were, it wouldn't be Gumby. The extras are entertaining and interesting. My favorites are the Photo Gallery and the First Pilot Episode with no sound. The pilot episode was never aired so I was quite thrilled to watch it. My 11-year-old son said he prefers sound but he's used to more modern day cartoons.  In the photo gallery the music is a fun and lively touch. Other extras included the Making of the Gumby.com spot, which is interesting although very brief. Also it includes Gumbasia, a theatrical short featuring similar claymation charactors that Clokey created in 1955. It is just a bunch of different playdough shapes moving to music but I like it because it is unique and adds something to the DVD.  I give this 4 out of 5 stars because of its entertainment value. Reviewed by Denise B., KIDS FIRST! Adult juror.

After more than 60 years since Gumby was first created, we are brought back to the good times of the original, and my opinion the best of the iconic Gumby and Pokey characters. Gumby is all about fun and comedy. You watch Gumby not for drama or romance. There is lots of action and fantasy, since it is all about Gumby's fun adventures. Art Clokey (creator of Gumby) does a fantastic job writing fun and unique episodes.

I love each of the characters for the fun and silly adventures they undertake and how unique each one is. Even small characters have their own personality which I love. Not many shows today pay so much attention to each character. I think Art Clokey has done a mind blowing job making these shows. He created some cool special effect techniques such as one episode with a rocket ship where he has scratched each frame so it looks like flames. Techniques like this were used in films for decades afterwards. The stop motion animation itself is very smooth and impressive, particularly since it was made 60 years ago!

My favorite episode is the first one, when Gumby goes to the moon and his Dad needs to save him. I love it because it starts off Gumby's career and is kind of the birth of Gumby. This also includes the rocket special effects mentioned above. The episode is really a joy to watch, not to mention that it was so symbolic for those times when everything was about space travel.

People that enjoyed Gumby growing up will be happy to share their passion with a new generation. After all, Gumby is meant for kids. Ages seven to eighteen would probably enjoy the series more than younger kids and would be able appreciate the beauty of the clay animation. I give it five out of five stars because, what they did was way ahead of their time with the special effects, unique stories, wonderful characters and more. Cant wait to see whats next in store for Gumby! (They are creating some entirely new episodes)

7313449,5,B010LY9PZ0,"FINALLY! So glad Gumby will get the video and audio treatment it deserves! Remastered from the original 35MM reels, original soundtrack (none of the 80's stuff here!) just classic Gumby in its original glory. Although this has not been released yet, I can say you will be very pleased by the restoration process. All have been handled with the utmost care. I have been a Gumby fan since childhood! Now I am 40 and Gumby is 60 and I can watch him as if he was filmed yesterday. I have the Australian release of the newly restoed episodes and they look beautiful! With the age of the film reels, you can expect minor scratches, dirt and specs, but it adds to Gumby's charm. Colors are vivid and picture is sharp. In short, GUMBY HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER and most like this will be the best we ever see him until a Blu Ray version is released. I have pre-ordered mine, and so should you. For all Gumby fans, THIS IS A MUST HAVE! So Pre-order yours now! Can't wait to see the 60's set next!

7313461,5,B010LY9PZ0,"I've always enjoyed Gumby since I was a kid, especially the 50s episodes, where the clay models were a little cruder (they were sculpted from scratch instead of using clay poured into molds as in the 60s and 80s) and have a more free-moving flowing look, Gumby acts and sounds more like a child, and he and Pokey went on some neat adventures amongst some cool vintage toys and through various books, and the funky sound effects and memorable John Seely/Capitol stock music (which was also used on early Hanna-Barbera cartoons, and some cues even showed up on ""The Ren and Stimpy Show"" and ""Spongebob Squarepants!"")
So when I found out this DVD set was coming out, I knew I had to get a copy, so I did. I held off on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gumby-7-Disc-Boxed-Set-w-Gumby-figure/dp/B0000639HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gumby - 7 Disc Boxed Set w/Gumby figure</a>&nbsp;DVD set from Rhino because I heard how it just used the 1988 re-dubs of the old Gumby episodes, with cheesy new synthesizer music and re-recorded voices. I remember seeing the redubbed versions on Nickelodeon as a kid, but even them I didn't like them as much as the original soundtracks. Part of the experience of classic Gumby, as I said, was the original voices, music and sound effects. Thankfully Premavision and the Clokeys were able to resolve the rights with the stock music, thus resulting in the original audio being used here. Visually, the episodes look great, with clear images and very vibrant colors, compared to the faded/worn transfers that were used on TV airings and VHS releases in the 80s and 90s. I really like how they were restored to their original 10-12 -minute lengths. Back in the early 60s, when Clokey Productions began making new 6-minute Gumby episodes for syndication, they re-edited the 50s episodes into 6-minute shorts, making some continuity problems when you'd watch them in order, and also featuring some bits of new animation at the start or end of episodes so it would make more sense. I will say, it's a lot more convenient watching the 50s Gumby episodes in their original length. Though a few artifacts from the early 60s re-editing remain (there are a couple brief bits of new animation seen in ""Moon Trip"" and ""Pokey Express,"" and ""The Magic Show"" has the title from its' re-edited half ""The Magic Wand""), it's great to get to see the old Gumby episodes close to how they were originally seen.
I also enjoyed seeing the ""Gumbasia"" short film (with its' groovy jazz soundtrack too!) and the (silent) Gumby pilot, which I remember seeing rerun on Nickelodeon under the title ""Baby Gumby.""
I also bought the 60s Gumby DVD sets, and they are also fun, though the 50s episodes are still my favorites. Now I'm waiting for them to release all the 80s episodes on DVD...",1487376000,,2831,4.987315010570825

They need to make a larger collection box set because when you're in the mood to leave this on you don't want to miss any of the episodes.  That's the only reason why I don't give this a five star rating.  NOT ENOUGH EPISODES.  I'd still buy it for sure until they come out with a bigger collection.,1447372800,2,392,4.0519480519480515

7313506,5,B010LY9PZ0,"This show is adorable! I grew up watching the Gumby movie from the 90s, but I never saw the actual show. After I had checked out a few episodes on YouTube, I knew I had to get the entire series. I love how imaginative this show can get! It really brings me back to my childhood, back in a time where I was inspired to do anything I set my mind to. There is so much creativity and whimsy in this original Gumby series, and I love how ahead of its time this show was with its sense of surrealism. In my experience, starting with the original series from the 50s is the best way to go if you're looking to check out anything Gumby related. I'm truly looking forward for the 60s and 80s series to be released in the near future!",1445299200,2,724,4.06993006993007
7313507,4,B010LY9PZ0,"Although I was a child of the late 80s/early 90s, Gumby was still a part of my childhood growing up, thanks to re-runs. So when I discovered this DVD set with a ton of the earliest episodes, I knew I had to have it.  And popping in just one of the two discs instantly brought back a ton of memories for me.

I'm sure everyone in the world has seen at least one Gumby cartoon at some point, but for the un-initiated, Gumby is a young boy made out of clay, who lives with his mom and dad in a timeless fantasy world where anything is possible. Along with his best friend, a red/orange horse named Pokey, he spends his time exploring the world; helping the various characters he meets, and having adventures; many of them via literally jumping into books in the library. From Toyland, to the Old West, to outer space, every episode is only limited by your imagination!

This DVD release is pretty nicely put together, with all the episodes unedited, and cleaned up to today's standards of picture quality. There's a few issues with the overall picture and sound, depending on the episode, but considering how old this series is, it's to be expected. That's a fault of the age, not the DVD.  It's interesting to look back and see how far Gumby's come--the art style is a tad different and more rough, and the characters' voices definitely changed over time, compared to later in the series, when the animation became much more smooth. And speaking of the characters, all we see in this set is Gumby, his parents, Pokey, and the villainous Blockheads. Other people I was familiar with, such as Gumby's sister, his dog Lowbelly, the band The Clayboys, and Prickle the dinosaur must've come in later years.  Never the less, all the included episodes are cute, innocent, and charming; sometimes teaching valuable lessons--other times just taking the viewer on a surreal experience. But simply put, they don't make cartoons like this anymore.

However, there IS possibly one spot to be concerned, in relation to today's standards of broadcasting. The episode, ""The Pokey Express"", deals with Gumby and Pokey helping deliver mail in the Old West, and having to confront a Native American tribe that are described as ""pesky, wild Indians"".  I realize what times we were in back then, but never the less, for those of you who are concerned about ""political correctness"", I thought this deserved a warning. Thankfully, in another episode, ""Rain Spirits"", the Indian tribe is shown in a much more favorable light, when one of the natives teaches Gumby and Pokey about his customs while they try to call rain to grow crops.

The special features are fairly cut and dry. Included is the unaired pilot episode, which unfortunately has no sound, but depicts Gumby's parents creating him, which is interesting.  There's also a short, ""Gumbasia"", which features a bunch of random shapes moving around, set to music--the animation is fairly impressive. But other than a photo gallery, that's it. Considering how influential of an artist Art Clokey was, it would've been nice to have a short featurette about him and his life, or some other behind the scenes of how he created Gumby.  Perhaps we'll get something like that on the next set that comes out, if one ever does.

None the less, if you loved (and still love) Gumby, this is a must have set to get. And if you're a brand new viewer, this is a nice introduction to his adventures. In comparison to today's television, which seems to have fast paced shows with nothing but talking, this series is far more quiet and laid back in it's delivery, and allows the viewer to breathe and soak in the world, and run away with their creativity. It's one of the most unique and imaginative shows ever created, and I strongly recommend it to kids and families everywhere. Here's hoping more of his adventures are eventually released.",1444694400,4,3857,4.74179104477612
