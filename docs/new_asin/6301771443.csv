7815518,5,6301771443,"I absolutely enjoyed this VHS.  Not so much for all the arias presented, some presenters were very good.  But I watched the facial expressions of Luciano.  Priceless. Here was a man who knew every note, of every aria. You could see in his facial expression just what he thought of the singers presentation. His smile, his eyes, his eyebrows, communicate so much. He had a face that spoke much without uttering a word. I sat there and chuckled, and enjoyed. Of course his own opera presentation was wonderful. I wish there were more of these tapes still available. He was indeed a God send.",1290211200,,589,4.644230769230769
7815519,4,6301771443,"A chance to see some budding opera stars when they were at Julliard, giving recitals for Pavarotti, as he sits at a table.  Pavarotti has difficulty articulating his opinions in English, but when he launches into song to demonstrate pianissimo, for example, it's priceless.  For the last 1/2 hour, he takes questions from the audience, then he sings.  Sit down with a glass of lambrusco (sparkling Italian wine) and enjoy.",1186876800,,422,5.0
7815520,3,6301771443,"This master class took place at the end of 70's, when Pavarotti was still relatively young. The length of this tape is only 60 minutes, so you probably shouldn't expect a lot of ""teachings"" here from Pavarotti. His comments and suggestions seem to me brief.

Program: ""E lucevan le stelle"" (Puccini: Tosca),  ""Non so piu"" (Mozart: The Marriage of Figaro), ""Questa o  quella"" (Verdi: Rigoletto), ""Di Provenza il mar"" (Verdi: La  Traviata), ""Infelice"" (Verdi: Ernani), ""Una voce poco  fa"" (Rossini: The Barber of Seville)

At the end of the class,  Pavarotti answered some questions from the audience, and then he sang  ""Per la gloria d'adorarvi"" from Buononcini's  ""Griselda.""",965779200,,675,5.175925925925926
