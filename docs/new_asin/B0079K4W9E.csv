5066950,3,B0079K4W9E,"If you're into sci-fi and action you may find this one reasonably entertaining. It combines an interesting disaster danger that I have not seen before so I give it credit for some originality. The acting varies from good to adequate but even the weakest of the actors is not so bad as to interfere with the flow of the story. I've seen it once now and will probably not watch it again for a long time.

It's rated PG but is generally suitable for anyone in the familly who likes sci-fi action flicks.",1343347200,2,500,4.376344086021505

5066952,4,B0079K4W9E,"I appreciated that this movie never attempted to be more than it was, cheap popcorn fare.  It isn't a masterpiece of Sci-Fi by any stretch.  The plot is purely by the numbers, following the same formula that most of these movies do: bad science runs amuck with an ill-advised project that the military then has to come in and rectify.  This is one of those dopey scenarios where everyone knows something crucial but they either hide the facts, dismiss the facts, or refuse to share the facts with anyone else.  The disaster in question could have been solved immediately if all the right people just sat down and talked about it rather than waiting until things got out of control.
The FX is what you'd expect from computer work.  The characters rigidly follow the usual stereotypes: a greedy boss (Greg Evigan), the reluctant hero (Lou Diamond Phillips), and the love interest who isn't a damsel in distress (Nicole Deboer).  There's also the added tension of a slacker son, a widow who knows the TRUTH about the project, and a spineless second in command who won't stand up to the boss.  For good measure, they peppered the rest of the small cast with crackpots and forgettable standbys.
This isn't the work of genius; this is a lazy attempt to cash in with familiar subjects that most people expect from television.  Worse, for a movie about widespread death and destruction, very little of either is ever seen.  Paris is wiped off the map but the only reason we know that is because someone in the movie says it happened.  At least they saved Philadelphia.

Happily for me, I happen to enjoy this type of crap, specifically because it is crap.  This is the type of movie I collect for double feature nights of equally bad movies.  There's an art to being this bad.  Some filmmakers have the knack for it, some don't.
(My favorite scene is when the satellites unfold and turn into Mickey Mouse heads.  I kid you not.)

This is strictly for those who get a kick out of garbage.  All others need to avoid it at any cost.",1339891200,12,2021,4.584958217270195
5066953,1,B0079K4W9E,"First indicator of cheap - no subtitles.
Second, the first of so many bad science scenes I was ready to puke for how badly our minds are being corrupted by writers/directors that can't even do the simple background research that any middle school science class would require. You wonder what they were doing in school - doodling?  Example: As the space camera pans past little dots representing stars (at least they weren't twinkling) the ones in the foreground shifted so much relative to the background stars that the camera would have to be traveling faster than light. That's called parallax! Or the ionosphere reaching the geosynchronous satellite. They don't come within 25,000 miles of each other!
Third, every CGI scene presented whether it was a cartoonish satellite unfolding it's solar panels or the blue luminescent cyclone with metal thingys flying around looked more laughable than scary. The green screen scenes, spaced about 5 minutes apart, of some metallic object being dragged toward our magnetic cyclone were just as bad. Even the aluminum and brass were being attracted!
Fourth, usual dysfunctional family relationship between teen and father with the expected teen coming around to help save the day.
Fifth, final one minute scene of giant growing blue cyclone killed off by the latest in military bad boys - a Predator drone. We're never really shown how (or even clearly explained) except blue magnetic cyclone deflated like a balloon.",1338076800,2,1459,5.156118143459915
5066954,2,B0079K4W9E,"This made for TV movie boasts the same fine quality production we have come to love in these masterpieces. Lou Diamond Phillips stars as a young looking Michael Edwards who works at Helios World. The company has a plan to extract energy from upper level ionic particles due to solar flares. (Light takes 8 minutes to travel from the sun to the earth. These flares take far less time.) Once captured, the energy is beamed to the earth as blue electromagnetic waves.

Unfortunately things don't go as planned. It creates an electromagnetic tornado that attracts anything metal, regardless of its magnetic properties...and chainsaws keep operating! While LDP is attempting to save the countryside of rural Pennsylvania he has to deal with the problems of single parenthood and trying to date fellow co-worker (Nicole de Boer).

The movie intensifies as LDP must hurry to come up with a way to save Philadelphia and France! Why do I not feel the intensity?

Fairly awful sci-fi movie, about Asylum grade. Might work for tweens.

5066993,3,B0079K4W9E,"An experiment with unlimited energy form solar flares go awry. At least that is the premise. In reality it is the standard disaster movie. The head of the firm was warned ahead of time that the technology had a flaw. Naturally it was ignored. After the fact Michael Edwards (Lou Diamond Phillips) suspects there is a problem; so do we.

The formula is standard. We already know the individual characters needed form watching other standard disaster movies and the plethora or tornado knockoffs. Now we get to guess which actor gets to play which character.

Finally they throw in some drones. But I miss big bugs and flame throwers.

The Lou is the man, I have said it before and I will say it again. Every time a new film or show comes out with Lou Diamond Phillips I must own it. The Lou is one of my favorite actors ever so when this came out I had to have it. Luckily for me I love b SYFY channel like movies so with a name like Metal Tornado I knew it was a film for me. As I suspected I loved it.

Helios World is an energy company on the verge of solving the worlds energy problem. They have created a way to convert solar flares into electrical energy, clean energy. The only problem is during the first attempt at the download a very low percentage is lost in the transmission. This low amount turns into a huge problem as a tornado of electrical energy hits the country side making its way across the east coast magnetically picking up all metal objects. This of course creates a Metal Tornado tearing up everything in sight. Michael Edwards [Phillips] who works for the company seemed to be the only one who cared at all that something went wrong during the download and as such is the only one to try to do anything about it. Now with multiple tornados heading for cities like Philadelphia and Paris France Michael must find a way to stop them.

With such a crazy title and concept I knew I was in for a good time and I was right. This is B movie entertainment at its finest with made for TV CG and writing. This was co written and directed by Gordon Yang who as produced films I enjoyed like Arctic Blast, Kaw, Screamers 2, Swarmed, Fire Serpent, and the excellent Dear Mr. Gacy so that was a plus. He knew what type of movie this was so the movie plays like it should. Sure the writing isn't the greatest thing but come on what do you expect from a film like this.

Acting wise the film is much better than it should be, of course The Lou is excellent as always. Nicole de Boer who most know from the excellent series The Dead Zone is great here as is everyone else in the film. Like I said the acting is better than it should be. With that said I am disappointed that the DVD release does not have a commentary on it. I absolutely love them particularly on these types of flicks, even a behind the scenes or making of would have been great. Still even with that I did enjoy this flick for what it is, if you are a fan of these types of flicks or are a fan of The Lou then I think you will too.",1392768000,7,2389,4.098290598290598
5067030,5,B0079K4W9E,"The science, well, but who is complaining I'm not, there is Lou Diamond Philips and that is enough for me. It offers a lot of action.
We get to see drones flying, cars sucked into the vortex and more. Lou Diamond Philips is also in another scifi movie I liked BATS. This is just plain good old fashion action, it never stops and for me this is why I bought DVD and so should you.",1387584000,,379,4.066666666666666
5067031,4,B0079K4W9E,This movie is close to being realistic and the acting was very good.  Some parts of the movie were way out there but in all it is a keepier,1384646400,,139,3.793103448275862
5067032,2,B0079K4W9E,"Or at least that's what the film's tagline informs us. However, it's quite easy to prepare for this movie: keep your expectations lower than the sunken city of Atlantis. Granted, I didn't expect much with a title and premise like this but it would have been nice to be proven wrong. The film suffers from the usual suspects in terms of problems: awful acting, a messy and predictable script, and PS2-era graphics that are meant to be special effects. However, what ultimately lets this film down is the total lack of surprise and suspense. The tornado never feels threatening or imposing; instead it's just a poorly-rendered computer effect that sucks up metal objects and seems to randomly move around rural Pennsylvania (while the citizens apparently never notice it until it's in their backyard). This thing just never pulls you into the story or seems to be anything other than a random collection of junk. The epic picture on the cover would lead you to believe otherwise. Nothing that exciting ever happens. Oh, but the city of Paris nearly gets wiped off the map and the Eiffel Tower gets dismantled with a graphic that looks like it was done in After Effects. That's almost worth the price of admission alone. People also have gashes on their foreheads every time they're injured. Hit in the legs? Head gash. Seeking shelter? Head gash. Don't worry, it doesn't make sense to me either.

There are some ""so bad it's good"" moments, including a chainsaw flying through the air and hitting a man, only to leave a cut in his hard hat without leaving a scratch on him. I'm serious. There's also a poster for a wanted man in the police station who looks like Jerry Garcia, so that's something I guess. This is a solid pick for something to laugh at or put you to sleep. If you like to have bad movie nights once in a while then this will suffice quite well.",1384041600,,1858,4.63030303030303

5067055,3,B0079K4W9E,"""Metal Tornado"" (2011) is another Syfy creature feature, although this time the ""monster"" is -- you guessed it -- a metal tornado, a magnetic vortex that attracts an increasing amount of metal objects (cars, toasters, etc.) and moves about according to an iron vein under the earth.

Aside from the protagonist Lou Diamond Phillips and Kate Drummond, the latter as a barely seen biker babe, the cast is blas (although the youth who plays Diamond's son is good).

As noted in my title blurb, ""Metal Tornado"" is surprisingly well done for a made-for-TV creature feature; unfortunately it's unmemorable. There's nothing about it that makes it standout from the scores of similar TV movies. Although it tries to work up suspense, it lacks drive, and it's definitely NOT horrifying. Ultimately, it just comes across as hackneyed and forgettable.

""Metal Tornado"" is only worth viewing if you have a preference for one or more of the cast members and you have an unquenchable hunger for these types of trite movies.

The story takes place in Pennsylvania, with many shots of Philadelphia (and some of Paris), but the film was shot in Ottawa.

The runtime is 90 minutes.

I love disaster movies. One thing that I've realized is there's never a shortage of them out there, especially when it comes to companies making B-movies. Metal Tornado, for what it is worth, is a moderately entertaining film. I must admit, I expected more considering the cast is made up of Greg Evigan, Lou Diamond Phillips, and  Nicole deBoer. Even so, Metal Tornado had an interesting premise to it..and, for the most part, kept my interest. I will agree with those out there who say this looks like an Asylum movie. Sadly, it does..but, if you watch alot of The Asylum's films(like I do), you can tell the difference. Most notably, where the CGI was concerned. Of course, it wasn't as bad as it could've been. There never was a moment when it looked laughable or cheap..it was, actually, quite decent. As far as SyFy channel original movies, Metal Tornado is better than other movies of this ilk out there.

5067062,3,B0079K4W9E,"There's nothing like a good low-budget disaster movie, and Metal Tornado acquits itself fairly well in this regard.  The acting is pretty good, the storyline holds up pretty well (as long as you accept the fantastical premise to begin with), and the special effects are plentiful and fairly decent.  Unlike most films of this type, the CGI never became laughably ridiculous.  Even my dislike for Greg Evigan and Lou Diamond Phillips didn't get in the way of me sitting back and enjoying this film to some degree.

Metal Tornado follows the basic low-budget disaster formula: scientist discovers design flaw, greedy boss refuses to listen and barrels ahead with the project, all hell breaks loose, and our hero is compelled to somehow save the day before more people are killed.  Helios, Inc. is ready to implement a plan that would harness the power of solar flares and store that power in the equivalent of ginormous batteries.  We're talking free energy, the ultimate solution to the world's energy crisis.  (Amazingly enough, the traditional power companies have done nothing to sabotage the project or kill its scientists.)  The initial test is seemingly a success, and company head Jonathan Kane (Greg ""B.J. without the bear"" Evigan) doesn't give a flying fig about a 2 percent energy loss during the transfer - just as he refused to listen to a former team member's warning of a design flaw.  Only project scientist Michael Edwards (Lou Diamond Phillips) and coworker/girlfriend Rebecca (cute little Nicole de Boer from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's final season) are concerned - and that concern grows as reports of strange occurrences come in from the surrounding Pennsylvania countryside.  There's a giant magnetic tornado going around sucking up everything metallic.  Hmmm, do you think this could possibly be related to that magnetic anomaly experienced during the energy transfer from Helios?  Nah, no one believes that except Michael and Rebecca.  In fact, the schedule for the next energy transfer (to take place just outside Paris) is actually moved up.

As far as Syfy channel original movies go, Metal Tornado is definitely somewhat better than most.  Sure it's sort of hard to believe a gigantic funnel of electromagnetic particles and metal objects can hop all over Pennsylvania for more than a day without someone picking up on its existence.  It's also hard to figure out why the handful of people who actually see the thing for themselves tell authorities they saw nothing.  On the other hand, the story moves along pretty steadily and is quite watchable.  I really don't think the movie is all that bad compared to many others in the genre.",1345852800,,2662,5.038812785388128
5067063,1,B0079K4W9E,"Okay, I watched this last night with my fiance and a buddy of mine.  The opening credits hadn't even finished rolling and already I was apologizing to them for picking such a horrible stinker of a movie.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Okay so the 3D graphics in this ""movie"" look like something that was made on someone's laptop in an afternoon using software from the 90's.  Seriously, when you see the satellites and the energy collectors and the tornadoes, they are just so lame and goofy looking that you can't help but laugh at them!

The storyline is pretty stock and cookie-cutter.  Some company has put all their money into this program and if it fails they'll go under.  But at the VERY beginning there is this guy who is the head high science guy or something and he's shouting into the phone that the process is flawed and to shut the project down and if they don't that people will die.  But they decide to ignore him, cuz after all what does he know?  He's only the head of science and safety for the whole program, let's just ignore everything he says, I mean it's not like that's the reason we hired him!

So the experiment goes off and loses 2% of it's energy which spawns the tornado that is magnetic and is pulling in everything that is metal, thus creating the metal tornado that gives this movie it's name.  So the tornado moves around yanking things into it, cars, motorcycles, a chainsaw, signs, etc.  But NO ONE sees the damn thing!  Seriously!  Everyone is like, ""Where'd it go?"" or, ""We have to find it!""  I mean seriously!  It's a HUGE FUNNEL CLOUD!  It's not like it's Jason Bourne in New York City where it can just blend into it's surroundings.  Just open your eyes and ears and you'll find it!  Or you could just follow the path of destruction that it is leaving behind it!

On top of that several times people are driving along and the thing is just off to the side and they DON'T SEE IT!  I mean seriously, do these people have like NO peripheral vision at all!?!

So the solution to this problem is to get the military to arm a drone with an EMP bomb and shoot it into the center to destroy it.  It works, we cut to afterwards where our main characters are just sitting around enjoying a drink and the credits roll.

5067064,3,B0079K4W9E,"Metal Tornado is another medium-strength effort from Syfy's Russian production house, whose work is largely indistinguishable from the Asylum's except that it isn't obviously stolen from theatrical blockbusters. This offering is yet another weather disaster movie- in this case, Man's Hubris (TM) unleashes magnetic whirlwinds that irresistibly draw anything metal into a towering vortex of death, unless those metal articles are in actors' clothing or the on-set effects team couldn't work out a way to make them shake convincingly. Since you would only possibly be reading a review of this movie if you were already a fan of Syfy's in-house matinees, I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Lou Diamond Phillips. If you missed the 80s and early 90s, Lou Diamond Phillips was in a bunch of memorable A-list films such La Bamba and Stand and Deliver, but by the late 90s had moved on to various B-list roles. He outshines other Syfy mainstays such as Dean Cain, but he lacks Michael Shanks' ability to stare at thin air and REALLY MAKE US BELIEVE that there's a killer tornado there.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Negligible. The military-industrial complex both creates and solves this film's disaster, which by the standards of these movies is pretty tame.

Carnage:
Surprisingly high. Syfy could have cheaped out and just shown the big electric tornado imposed behind a city skyline (and they do, a lot) but there's a fair bit of destruction too, albeit mostly CG. The body count, however is strangely low for one of these movies, and for a movie about a disaster that kills you by ripping you to bits with chunks of tattered sheet steel, largely PG.

Awful Effects:
Better than you would expect. This is mostly due to a lessened reliance on CG- when a general store full of stuff is shaken by powerful magnetic forces, they just spill a bunch of stuff all over. The CG we do get is decent from a distance, but closeup effects shots are still pretty poor. Whoever does the effects for these movies is getting a lot better at matching their lighting to the shot, though.

Romantic Subplot:
Confusing. Lou has a girlfriend, but because she and he, and Lou's teenage son, all hang out together and are super familiar, I just assumed they were married already. Then at the end of the movie the Son SUGGESTS a wedding out of the blue (HAHAHA WEATHER PUN). Still, this makes more sense than the usual ""we stopped the volcano under Columbus, hey let's get hitched"" romances in these films.

Big Action Truck:
I THINK Lou's son's school buddy drives a F-150 regular cab. That's pretty rugged, but no match for the wide-wheelbase Hilux Michael Shanks drove in Arctic Blast.

Overall, then, Metal Tornado is not  avery good movie. But it's better than you might expect, and I think Syfy deserves our respect for that. Also, I LIKE Syfy. I like that they make these cheesy stinkers, I like that they give jobs to old washed-up actors, and I like that at 4 AM I can turn on my TV and instead of endless infomercials and Mash reruns, I can see Man-Thing rendered as a teen slasher flick with a 50k budget. So if you're like me, you'll like this movie too. Otherwise, you probably won't.",1344816000,2,3213,4.766187050359712
