8445825,4,B004X0MGGE,"The quality of the DVD was excellent.  The soloists as usual were outstanding.  While Xv CD was 2 discs, this was only 1 DVD.  I would have been happier with 2 DVDs as The first half of the concert did not grab me & make me fall in love with the music. The magic begins with songs 10-18.  There are some familiar songs on the latter part such as My Mind Is Made Up, Hold On Don't Give up, Holy Ghost Power, & God Is My Everything which are classic & I never get tired of listening to. I would probaby opt. for the CDs & just listen to Disc No. 2.  The DVD is not very exciting to watch.",1377820800,,586,3.85
