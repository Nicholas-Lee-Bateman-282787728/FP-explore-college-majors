8500216,4,B006KZ1HK6,A Good Movie About Henry Miller,1460937600,,31,4.333333333333333
8500217,5,B006KZ1HK6,"I am supposing this would be categorized as a biographical documentary that is, gratefully, comprised
of Henry Miller's rolling monologues. His conversation is precious, his speech prose-like and in fact he writes like he speaks. One of the best programs I've seen since 'Ram Dass: Fierce Grace',

Highly recommended,

Duane McMahon.",1353456000,2,333,5.509803921568627
8500218,3,B006KZ1HK6,"cudos to any documentary film maker that challenges the very nature of that hum-drum world... Bob tried his best,but his own personality interfered.. But without him, there neve would have been anything on HM... He was a valued friend, confidant and a great person... So it's worth watching... Someone should get the miles of unused film out of the vaults and go forward.....",999216000,8,375,4.968253968253968
8500219,3,B006KZ1HK6,"It's wonderful to watch and hear Miller on screen--he comes across as the coot you hoped him to be, and you get to know him more personally.  The big problem with the film is that director, Robert Snyder, indulges  Miller--the older Miller, insomniac, chasing Japanese girls; the Big Sur,  guru-type, full-of-himself Miller--far too much.  Unfortunately, Snyder  seems to be the type of Miller devotee who takes the man at face  value--that is, Snyder believes entirely in the image Miller was fond of  projecting.  There's no depth whatsoever to the film, no compelling  questions are answered about Miller's real life and work, and the Miller  initiate will find the documentary disappointing, as he will learn nothing  about Miller beyond what the author has already said in his works.  Though  it's fun to watch as a document of Miller's voice and personality, it's  rather too sycophantic and too shallow as a documentary.",939686400,10,927,5.093333333333334
