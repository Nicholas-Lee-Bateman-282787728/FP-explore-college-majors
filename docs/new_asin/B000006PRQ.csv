7904787,4,B000006PRQ,"I remembered back late in 1997 watching British Rail Journeys on PBS. These series tended to be very laid back, with some quasi-Celtic music included here and there. They are also proud of the fact that steam engines over in Britain are making a comeback, and for real good reason. It has that certain character and charm you can't get with your generic, run-of-the-mill trains like you get with Amtrak, for example, over here in America. Although the series does cover a lot of non-steam train routes as well. Although made in 1996-1997, there's a rather low-budget feel to this series, making it look more like it was made in the late 1980s than the late 1990s. Largs to Stranraer (in the southwest corner of Scotland, on the coast, south of Glasgow) isn't my favorite British Rail Journeys, mainly because they also show some really ugly, industrial areas of that part of Scotland, not to mention they don't seem to show a lot of what I would consider scenic. This series succeeds most when showing the more rustic, rural, and historical parts of the country, which the Largs to Stranraer seems to be a bit lacking in. My favorite one is Middlesbrough-Pickering, which is in Yorkshire, as that shows the best qualities of the British Rail Journeys, as they do show a lot of nice, rustic, rural scenery (my favorite of that one is the North York Moors National Park), of the type I like to see whenever I have the ability to visit Britain. I don't make claims that British Rail Journeys is the best rail journey series I've seen (that probably goes to Swiss Rail Journeys), mainly because the narration gets a little boring in places, but it's still a nice little series worth watching.",1023840000,,1688,4.686868686868687
