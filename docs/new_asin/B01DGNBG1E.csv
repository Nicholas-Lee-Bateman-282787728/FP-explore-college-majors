7712462,5,B01DGNBG1E,"Kino Lorber has done a marvelous job restoring the classic DePatie-Freleng cartoons; this being no exception.

The cartoons are in their original 4x3 aspect ratio (the screenshot should say enough; token from Bluray.com), preserving the stylized artistic quality of the original theatrical shorts.

A great release for any animation fan",1466208000,4,336,5.7
7712463,5,B01DGNBG1E,"Contrary to what one reviewer said, these are not in widescreen. They are also struck from the master prints and look gorgeous.",1462924800,4,127,4.818181818181818
7712464,5,B01DGNBG1E,"After carefully viewing the screencap that was provided, as what purchased customers who have bought this DVD/Blu-Ray should have done in the first place, I can safely say this collection is worth buying after all.",1462233600,,214,5.142857142857143

8755918,5,B01DGNBG1E,So nice to add this fun bit of animation history in my animation library.,1477958400,,73,4.285714285714286
8755919,5,B01DGNBG1E,"Incredible, delightful, wonderfully vintage and happily accepted! Thank you Kino Lorber!
On BluRay the transfers are for lack of a better word perfect! Even the decades ago chance that I've seen any of these on a darkened movie theater screen as a kid I would never have appreciated how rich and colorful they are in today's world displayed on today's technolog. I'm tickled to enjoy them now!",1477785600,,393,4.880597014925373
8755920,5,B01DGNBG1E,"Superb cartoons from Freleng and De Patie.
One can watch this DVD again and again.",1476316800,,82,4.533333333333333
8755921,5,B01DGNBG1E,"Since so much of the past animation coming out on DVD has slowed down in recent years, it was wonderful that this collection came out. Filled with great commentaries by cartoon experts Jerry Beck and Mark Arnold this Blu ray is just .  . . fun and wonderful.

I didn't remember much about ""Roland and Rafting,"" but I do recall the Depatie Freling style of minimalist animation (at least compared to classic Disney films), but I enjoyed this series. R & R are excellent comic foils for each other, and the writers and directors do an excellent job in coming up with settings and situations for the two antagonists.

The work put into this Blu Ray shows, and I hope Kino Lobber  (the company that has the license for DP) puts out more, even the infamous Super President.

8755925,5,B01DGNBG1E,"All 17 shorts containing the Dudley Do-Right-esque Roland and Rattfink are in this DVD & Blu-ray collection, all remastered in HD, in their original Fullscreen format, and have no laugh tracks at all! These were originally not seen on TV with the Pink Panther, due to the level of violence being used in these, and there were very strict rules about violence on TV during the time ANY of these DePatie-Freleng shorts were made! When much of the violence rules for TV were lifted in the 80's and 90's, Roland and Rattfink would finally be seen on TV with the Pink Panther and their other affiliates' shorts, especially on Cartoon Network and Boomerang! Before the series ended, 2 of the shorts contained solid white characters through the whole shorts; it's uncertain if they did that just for being creative, or as a cost-cutting measure. All of the other shorts have the characters in color! Like the other Pink Panther affiliates' shorts collections so far, this one also has a bunch of bonuses; here it's 2 documentaries also used in the Tijuana Toads set, and a whole bunch of commentaries! Both stars were normally voiced by Leonard ""Lennie"" Weinrib, who'd end up being the original voice of Scrappy Doo, Scooby's ever-troublesome nephew, as well as Prince Abadaba in Bugs Bunny's 1001 Rabbit Tales! You never know what kind of ""sitch-ee-a-tion"" Roland and Rattfink will get into, and fight each other over, next; in a similar manner of Dudley Do-Right and Snidely Whiplash's fights, and especially those of Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam! You'd be amazed at what happens to them in their final short, but I better not spoil it for you, if you hadn't seen these!",1471478400,2,1664,4.821678321678322
8755926,5,B01DGNBG1E,How cool can it be to the whole series of Roland & Rat Fink in one great blu ray set . Very cool indeed .,1470787200,,105,3.24
