You will laugh out loud at the unintentionally hilarious dialogue, and you'll cry when you realize that you paid to rent this film.

Its dated from a production standpoint...but the overall relevance of fathers -- especially those of African-American boys --- being such a key and influential role in their lives is something that remains and will never grow old.

Supporting Black film is important and this movie is a great throwback addition to my collection.",1454630400,,456,4.82051282051282

102531,5,0790731797,"m I've always been a fan of this movie because of the great acting from Glenn Plummer who in my opinion has been an underrated actor for years. This movie isn't based on any true story which makes it somewhat generic but that's not always a bad thing because it was and still is very much so relatable, and relevant to an audience. The dvd itself is about as bare bone as you can get, not even a trailer but the movie is heartwarming.",1419120000,4,434,4.178571428571429

How important family, morals and values are and it is not necessarily a close friend or blood relative who will be the one willing to educate. Also not all, most so called friend(s) are a friend.

102575,5,0790731797,POWERFUL MESSAGE. Watching someone transform themselves from being on the brink of throwing their life away to wanting to be a responsible father all the while saving his son from the same ranks he had once embellished.

The lead character, Bobby Johnson, in an excellent performance by Glenn Plummer, finds redemption in a jail cell after being found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years, leaving behind his infant son in the care of the child's mother, who is strung out on pcp.",1389139200,,537,4.36

102584,5,0790731797,This movie is about gang/gangster life in the inner city. But... the heartwarming part about this movie is the price a father has to pay to get his son out of the same gang he went to jail for and make a real life free of gang activity and involvement for him. This father was ready to lay down his life to save his son. This is a must see movie in my opinion for anyone that feels gang bangers are unreceptive and cannot be rehabilitated.,1369872000,,439,4.116279069767442

102646,5,0790731797,...but it makes me sad the level of truth behind it.  What makes me sadder is that this kind of mentality still exists today.  I would definitely rank this one up with the likes of Boys in The Hood and New Jack City.,1154649600,,216,4.0
102647,4,0790731797,"One of the overlooked gang movies, with exceptional realism against the same backdrop as ""Boyz n Hood,"" the undeserved Hollywood-styled movie. ""South Central,"" on the other hand, gets more from the cast and B-movie economics than ""Hood."" The director and writer narrow the aim and score more for doing so, in my opinion. Of those who play at violence, the plot centers on one who owns up to his bad ways and pays the price. Gang warfare, the soup de jour of Hollywood, makes too much money off bad languange and violence. This B-movie responsibly shows the price for dead-end lifestyles that embrace drugs and violence as the only alternatives. Gang warfare is as obsolete today as dueling in the 16th Century. This is one movie that asks its youth to take responsibilty,reform themselves through self-education,not to waste their freedom that comes with deadly consequences.",1149292800,2,875,5.041379310344827
102648,4,0790731797,"When you think about it, many 'hood movies dropped around the early 90's, like ""Boyz N The Hood"", ""New Jack City"", ""Menace II Society"" etc. All of these got the recognition they deserved, and they have all stood the test of time, as all of them are over 10 years old. However, there is one movie that didn't get the recognition and publicity that it should have. This is the 1991 ""South Central"". South Central is a great hood movie with a different twist to it than the others I mentioned. It is also very touching in certain places. It takes place in Los Angelas just like almost all these other hood movies so that's no surprise.

The movie starts off with a young Bobby Johnson getting out of jail. After fighting with a local drug-dealer over his girlfriend, he kills the drug-dealer who's name is Genie Lamp. He lays low for a few months, then he decides to ride out with a few other members of the Deuce gang, which he is part of. They pick up an undercover cop along the way, and she busts them for possession. While the newly proclaimed ""OG"" Bobby Johnson is being interrogated by the police, his fingerprints match the prints on the silencer and the gun he used to kill Genie Lamp. He takes the blame for everything and doesn't drop any names of the other members of the Deuce gang. Due to that he has to serve a decade in prison. There he finds from Loco, and old Deuce friend, that his own son was becoming a Deuce and that he was stealing stereos for Ray Ray, the leader of the Deuce gang. The rest of the movie is centered around Bobby trying to get his son out of the gang life and keeping him from making the same mistakes he did. Can Bobby convince his son that being in a gang is not worth the price you pay? Or is it too late for Jimmie (His son's name) to get out of his lifestyle?

The acting is OK, but not too memorable. Glenn Plummer, who also played Parnell is Menace II Society, did an excellent job as OG Bobby Johnson. Christian Coleman as Jimmie ""J-Rock"" Johnson did an exceptional job for a child actor, but at times it seems as if he kinda overacts a lil bit. At some scenes he's a little bit too enthusiastic with his dialogue (I don't know maybe they wanted it to be like that). Larita Shelby as Bobby's girlfriend Carol was exceptional as well, but she kinda overacted too. However, at the parts where she was messed up on PCP and at the times when she was pissed the acting came through quite well. Byron Minns did a great job as Ray Ray. I feel he captured the character pretty well. Overall I'd say the acting was decent, I've seen better but I've definitely seen worse.

So, I'd say if you're a fan of hood movies or gangster movies this would appeal to you. Don't expect the greatness of Juice or Boyz or Menace though. But this is highly entertaining and definitely worth a rent, and even a buy because you can probably buy it very cheap now (I bought it at my local Best Buy for 5.99). Now that I think about it though, you probably won't find it in video stores, so I'd say find a month when it's coming on BET to see if you like it. BET plays it from time to time. I would check it out if these types of movies interest you. It's good for its genre. 4 Stars.",1116720000,24,3201,4.227124183006536
