This new Pound Puppies DVD Puppy Love is out today, just in time for Valentine's Day! Share the love with your kids and fur babies watching this fun DVD.

This DVD includes five episodes starring the furry friends and runs for just under two hours! I love DVD's that are this length because my kids can usually watch the entire thing or we can break it down in episodes if we don't have as much time.

I love the choices of voices matched with the dogs that just suit them perfectly. They are such a fun group of puppies and when I hear it without seeing it, I forget that they are puppies! They have such colorful personalities.

The Pound Puppies Puppy Love DVD is a must have for all the Pound Puppy fans!",1422921600,,917,4.222857142857142
