4992390,1,B006IY1MFO,very boring,1418947200,,11,5.0
4992391,1,B006IY1MFO,"um, please have someone who can speak english so that you can understand what they are saying. Even if they use improper grammar like me.",1416528000,,137,4.52
4992392,4,B006IY1MFO,"interesting, gave me more information than I learned in school 50 years ago, or refreshed it.  Truly informative and well worth watching.  I recommend it.",1414627200,,154,5.12
4992393,4,B006IY1MFO,Interesting... I wish the production was better but it was done well enough.,1414195200,,76,4.923076923076923
4992394,5,B006IY1MFO,Sir Kenneth Clarke set the gold standard for this approach to history and art almost a half century ago. This is a modern approach that has echoes of Clarke and its merits are considerable both in its depth and photography.,1411516800,,223,4.6
4992395,2,B006IY1MFO,"I like history but this video did not hold my interest.  There was too much attention to the virtues of Chinese society and too little to what actually happened.  Also, the main narrator was a little caustic in my opinion.",1409788800,3,222,4.525
4992396,3,B006IY1MFO,"This is part two; without watching the first part it will not have a broader context. Being so short (20+ minutes) I am not sure why they broke it up into two parts. The material presented is interested, particularly the message that Chinese civilization made great advances even before Western civilization. I am not sure if the facts are true, but it appears that Western scholars have corroborated the assertions. Some of the dramatizations are a bit corny and without depth; they have the quality of a children's mythical story, stripped of details.",1406764800,4,553,4.956989247311828
4992397,3,B006IY1MFO,"I found it interesting that China was so advanced, so long ago.  The low-budget nature of this film somehow adds to its charm.  Don't watch this if you are lacking IQ or attention span, it will seem like the most boring presentation ever.",1370044800,6,238,4.511627906976744
4992398,1,B006IY1MFO,Very little detail and what they do go into detail about is the most boring presentation ever. Priced right at free or less.,1368748800,2,124,4.434782608695652
8499070,3,B006IY1MFO,"ok, but not for a time when you are bored.",1446940800,,42,3.3
8499071,2,B006IY1MFO,"Dubbed, with lots of repetition. Pretty basic stuff. No controversy or speculation. Hews to the party line about Chinese history and culture.",1443225600,2,141,5.454545454545454
8499072,1,B006IY1MFO,"This is very interesting.  I find it absolutly impossible that 6,000 years ago these people were making tools. I give this part of the world credit for forming a very early civilization as did the west.  I even feel the Chinese were able to advance somewhat faster than the West, but nothing like this file states.",1442620800,,314,4.589285714285714
8499073,1,B006IY1MFO,I'm fascinated by history of any kind... I couldn't get through this. It was like the most boring teacher in the world lecturing on and on and on.,1442275200,,146,4.25
8499074,3,B006IY1MFO,"A little too biased, IMHO. The idea, common among Chinese scholars, that China's development owed nothing to external influences sends the entire history project off the rails. The even deny that ancestral Chinese, unlike the rest of the world, originated anywhere else but China. The overall quality of the presentation was high, but it needed input from some non-Chinese historians.",1439769600,2,384,5.416666666666667
8499075,4,B006IY1MFO,Informative,1436400000,,11,11.0
8499076,3,B006IY1MFO,"A bit dull. Combination of history and archaeology, but not much of either.",1430524800,,75,4.846153846153846
8499077,4,B006IY1MFO,I love history and it is good to see that the history of the world is just not limited to the western European propaganda.,1426032000,,122,4.125
8499078,3,B006IY1MFO,"Strong on national chauvinism, short on scientific documentation. That said ,it was an interesting introduction to Chinese archeological investigation. Much will probably be elucidated as these studies progress and profit from international review. The most extensive archeological work has been centered on Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley. Much remains to be investigated in other parts of the world.",1425513600,3,401,5.931034482758621
8499079,4,B006IY1MFO,well done. I am looking forward to the remaining episodes.,1423872000,,58,4.9
