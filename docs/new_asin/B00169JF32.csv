3154467,3,B00169JF32,"I'm a long-time WHA fan from San Diego, and picked this up because it had the 1977 WHA All-Star Game on it.  The San Diego Mariners were in first place in the Western Division at the All-Star break, and ended up with a bunch of players on the All-Star team (Lacroix, Ferguson, Noris, Shmyr, Morrison).

Lots of other stars were in this game - of course Hull, Howe & JC Tremblay, but there is Bernier, Tardif, Stapleton, Ftorek and many others.

My take is that the WHA in 1976-77 was not very much improved over the WHA from 1974-75... the oldtime NHLers are now all 2 years older, and there are only a few young superstars added to the mix (Hedberg, Nillson).  Gone are Cheevers and Frank Mahovlich.

The announcers for the All-Star game are really quite bad, they make a lot unintersting and almost derogatory comments, and totally miscall the first goal scored by the West, insisting again and again that it was Bobby Hull who scored the goal, when it was obviously Paul Shmyr.

The Quebec-Winnipeg game turns into a rout... and the ""host"" ruins the game by telling you who wins, even before the game starts... the game could have been somewhat exciting, if you didn't know how it would end.  It starts out and keeps up at a high pace - and J.C. Tremblay's long goal in the 2nd period is a classic.",1221177600,6,1301,4.4641350210970465

8261702,3,B00169JF32,Not much detail or history here. I expected a documentary on the WHA. It's not. The details are sparse but there is a wonderful interview with Bobby Hull as he speaks at length about why he left the NHL for this new league. A shorter session with Gretzky and a couple of old games are included..but that's it.,1431993600,,309,4.344827586206897
8261703,3,B00169JF32,"It was boring watching full games rather than highlights, although the WHA vs. Russia was a lot of fun to watch. I understand there is not much in the way of footage so I think they did the best with what was available. The Bobby Hull / Wayne Gretzky interviews were great.",1427932800,,273,4.269230769230769

8261707,4,B00169JF32,it should have more player interviews from the old days the 70s  the games are ok the fights are great,1365811200,,102,4.1
8261708,5,B00169JF32,"As we survey the aftermath of the recent 2012-2013 NHL labour lockout, viewing this DVD set brought back wonderful memories of seven very brief years when the National Hockey League was not the only game in town.
  With exclusive videos of WHA championship victories by the Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets, the DVD also presents a WHA All-Star game and the little-known exhibition win by the New England Whalers over the Soviet National hockey team.
  For me, the highlight of the set is an exclusive interview with Bobby Hull, whose defection from the Chicago Blackhawks rocked the NHL and brought viability to the fledgling World Hockey Association in 1972. Bobby shares a great story about how mavericks ""Wild Bill"" Hunter and Ben Hatskin inadvertently pushed NHL moguls to get involved in the Canada-Russia Summit Series in 1972. The NHL was in its own little world, but before it was too late they foresaw there could be North American involvement in international hockey without them unless they pushed to the front of the line.
  The series was woefully ill-timed, as the senior league still relied on predictable and easy-to-defend ""linear"" hockey, clearly icing an ill-prepared all-star squad, but hockey history was unfolding before our eyes. As time wears on, the Canada-Russia series of '72 remains one of Canada's fondest national memories.
  The WHA not only opened up hockey, but perhaps the world also. Starting with western European players, eventually players defected from Czechoslovakia and Russia.
  Entering with a bang, the rival league went down with a whimper, ending up with only 4 of their franchises being absorbed in a 1979 ""expansion."" Of these four (Winnipeg Jets, Edmonton Oilers, Quebec Nordiques, Hartford Whalers), only the Edmonton franchise survived. The NHL vanquished its rival, almost completely erasing memory of it, but the 7-year blip made for many great hockey memories.
  I am disappointed and frankly, greatly surprised, no WHA Hockey tapes survived from Global TV's 1970s coverage of the Toronto Toros! Does anyone remember the broadcasting troika of Mike Anscombe, Carl Brewer and Bill Bird, covering the Toros weekly from a half-full/half-empty Maple Leaf Gardens, icing luminaries like Shotgun Tommy Simpson, Frank Mahovlich, Paul Henderson, Les Binkley, Vaclav Nedomansky, Gilles Gratton, Dave Tataryn, Greg Neeld and Carl Brewer (called out of retirement)? I suspect that not all of the games disappeared and if my hunch is right, they are probably occupying some lucky person's library as I type. Alas, perhaps we'll never know.",1360195200,4,2584,5.275609756097561
8261709,5,B00169JF32,"totally lived up to what it was advertised as. the quality of the games is great, though i wouldnt have cared if it was not. the metal case is awesome as well.  i would not have minded some portions of games as well as part of a second or larger version of this set. there is a fight montage which while entertaining proves that there is plenty more WHA footage out there. great set here, though.",1343520000,,396,4.2105263157894735
8261710,5,B00169JF32,"Yes it was a rebel league, but you can't help loving them for challenging the stranglehold that the NHL had on professional hockey at the time. The WHA changed hockey forever. It's really hard to believe that there is so little video evidence left of the league. This 3-disc DVD set captures all the moments that are left from the rival league of the 70's. I highly recommend it to all hockey fans. It is a great historical document. I can't wait to watch it again.",1238889600,5,465,4.4186046511627906
8261711,4,B00169JF32,"Considering the time and types of transmissions for the period, this is a tresure for Nords, WHA, and Hockey fans in general.  There just are not many real WHA videos out there and this one is worth the look if the price is right.  The highlight is old building the Nordiques called home.  Young fans will get a chuckle out of the atire of the locals, and all fans will be surprised at the pace of the action.  This league and this period was not the birth of the trap.",1224806400,3,469,4.177777777777778
