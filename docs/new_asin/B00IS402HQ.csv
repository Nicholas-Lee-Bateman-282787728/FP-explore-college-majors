6290412,3,B00IS402HQ,This is a good film. Not full of his trade mark slap stick comedy and kung fu. More of an adult tone moving away from the original police story structure again as with New police story 2004. It's nice to see him acting in more serious roles. This I would say is more of a crime story than police story. Not the best Jackie Chan film I've seen but well worth the watch as its the full uncut version . Once it gets an American release they will cut it to bits as they do with all his chinese films!! Just a warning to any one in the UK buying this.  I've always bought dvds from outside UK as its cheaper even with postage majority of time but this time I have been arse raped by customs!!! And royal mail charging me import tax!! Handling tax and VAT!! Never have I had that happen!! So a 13 DVD ending costing me 27 !!!! Watch yourself :-(,1397088000,4,839,4.054216867469879
8644849,5,B00IS402HQ,"Though older Jackie Chan is wiser and more resolute in putting messages that he believes in into his stories. In this latest in the loosely connected Police Story line (the first four maintained continuity and characters; the last two, including this outing, do not and can be watched and thoroughly enjoyed without any backstory other than what it provides internally) Jackie plays Detective Zhong Wen who, despite his violence-as-necessary line of work, believes in the sanctity of human life no matter who you are or what youve done. He will try to save the innocent and the guilty alike, but hell fight like hell doing it if need be. This is the message of this particular filmthat all life is sacrosanct even when a decidedly negative reality challenges that notion.

Zhong is a father with an estranged daughter. He goes to see her and meet her new beau in a shady nightclub. His danger-dar goes off immediately as he notices subtle problems there, and he doesnt like his daughters new boyfriend, but he doesnt want to make waves either. He neednt worry as his daughters new boyfriend used her to draw him in and set him up. With Zhong now captured the villain, Wu Jiang, can begin to unwrap his scheme of which Zhong is at its heart. Jiang owns the nightclub that he has Zhong trapped in and he and his goons lock it down (thus the title) and begin a game of cat-and-mouse with Zhong and his daughter and other prisoners. There is something bigger here that is going on and as this is slowly revealed we see that Jiang isn't the standard sort of villain Chan usually squares off against. Chans Zhong does square off against Jiang and his men and has frequent and sometimes pretty brutal hand-to-hand fights. Zhong also advocates for many of the prisoners release while he does some undercover work during an escaped period. He also has an opportunity to allow his police/SWAT unit take Jiang out by sniper but saves Jiang (again, Chan is reinforcing the message that he has established, and he continues to reinforce it throughout the entire movie). The unraveling of exactly what Jiang wants with Zhong and some of his other prisoners is nicely saved for the last act of the movie, giving it depth as you're not seeing this coming, and giving it more clarity through a tighter focus as it wasn't dragged out over the course of the film. I found it a nice and engaging twist and I liked the ending where Zhong (Chan) is essentially forced to choose whether to save his life or to sacrifice it to save his daughter and, by virtue of saving his daughter, also save Jiang who controls his daughters fate. Because of the repeating message of the film you might think you know how thisll turn out. But it might surprise you.

Jackie Chan is not known for making thrillers but thats what this tight little package of a movie turns out to be and it works and it works well IMO. Chans character is likable because of his heroic virtues, as is often the case, but this movie carries a decidedly heavier tone than most Chan actioners. Zhong certainly has a warmth toward his daughter but there is little warmth exhibited by any of the other characters. This isn't as gritty as I remember the previous Police Story (New Police Story) being but its a serious role and well done. This movie gets better with age. Chan is still the man.",1490486400,,3329,4.602693602693603

8644853,4,B00IS402HQ,"Let me start by saying that I am a devoted Jackie Chan fan, and I've seen virtually all of his movies. I have a large collection of imports and have even gone so far as to track down rare uncut versions. The original Police Story is probably one of the most important movies for me on a personal level.

This film is well-shot, and Jackie gives a dramatic performance. For most of the film, I was on the edge of my seat and wasn't sure what exactly to expect. There aren't a ton of fights--really, Chan only has one, and it's not what you'd expect from him. It features more MMA than kung fu, and expect lots of quick shots and shaky camera. Still, it was an exciting and unpredictable scene, and unlike past films, I couldn't tell whether the underdog Jackie would finally succeed. Jackie is 60, and it shows.

The movie was very good, I thought, until about the last 25 minutes, at which point the writing was too clever for its own good. There were a few too many twists, which is in my experience is typical of Asian action films, but there were so many here that the larger premise lost interest.

I've seen the original Police Story probably 30 times, but there's not much in this one to make me want to watch it again. Once you've seen it and know all of the plot twists, there's not much reason to watch it again. The fight was exciting, but it was the suspense of it, not the actual choreography, that was intriguing. In the end, however, it's worth watching.",1426809600,,1468,4.350364963503649

Intense,edge of seat pacing,great actting showing chan's evolution as an actor.and great fight sequences.
But subtitles to small an glad no dubbing.
