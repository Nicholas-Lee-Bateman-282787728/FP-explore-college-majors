195397,3,1574924451,"Although the plot could use some work as far as creativity, this is still an enjoyable family film.  The high points for me included ""We Don't Go Together At All"", a sweet love song between two of the younger  generation, and the consumate performance of Terrence Mann, who portrays  Augustus P. Tavish.  He is hilariously funny with all his facial and verbal  expressions, and gives such a delightfully malicious rendition to his song,  ""Tavish Toys"".  He is the ultimate villain and has a rich  baritone voice.  No wonder he is a star on broadway.  While Angela  Landsbury, who plays the title role, is also enjoyable, I feel her talents  were somehow misused here--her character should have had a lot more spunk.  The rest of the cast plays adequately, with their own epithets.  Enjoyable,  if not Oscar material.",949795200,,816,4.854014598540146
195408,5,1574924451,"AN Original Jerry Herman score & book collaboration with Angela Lansbury starring in the featured role of ""Mrs. Santa Claus"" .... A CBS TV Christmas 1996 Event Special - filmed after the TV ""Murder, She Wrote"" television series had been cancelled by CBS.  The lavish TV musical was a CBS consolation cookie for X-MSW Angela Lansbury fans!  Rob Marshall's staging and choreography before his directing the feature film ""Chicago"" is an interesting study in comparison of the two musical projects.  Jerry Herman's on film cameo playing in an upstairs honky-tonk piano in the film's major opening dance number in the streets of NYC's production number ""Avenue A"" is an unusual plum.  An archival piece of a TV's feature film Event Special is remarkable for production settings, costuming, casting, musical performances and choreographic dance and camera staging!",1514160000,,858,5.286764705882353
195409,3,1574924451,"This movie is a delight.  The only reason I did not give it more stars is that the ending fails to live up to the rest of the film.  This is a classically staged musical.  The actors are great, the singing is good, and with the exception of the last 10 minutes, the story is delightful and uplifting with some important messages.  However, the resolution of the final confrontation was too quick, too easy, and too contrived.  Just before that the main character sings a song that is both out of character and contrary in many ways to the messages of the rest of the movie.  I believe I understand what they were trying to accomplish with the song, but it didn't work, and least not for our family.  I wouldn't pass on the movie because of these short comings; but neither would I rush out to buy it again.",1513900800,,806,4.333333333333333
195410,4,1574924451,"Every time I watch this movie I ask myself, why does Santa have a windmill at the North Pole?  But thats how it starts out, a long shot of the North Pole and Santas windmill.
The plot is a tad on the sad side.  Mrs. Claus (the incredible Angela Lansbury) is feeling overlooked, underappreciated, and dismissed.  She runs away from home, taking the sleigh and reindeer with her.  It takes Santa (Charles Durning) two days to figure out she is gone, and he has to be told this by his number one elf Arvo (Michael Jeter).  Meanwhile, Mrs. Claus is in New York City singing and dancing, getting involved with a suffragette and the abomination of child labor.  She runs afoul of a terrible fiend, Augustus P. Tavish of Tavish Toys (Terrence Mann).  He has teddy bear issues.
Christmas is coming, Cupid is injured, will Mrs. Claus make it back in time or will Christmas be canceled.",1513382400,,876,4.54140127388535

195436,5,1574924451,"This is a very different kind of Christmas movie compared to most you see.  Well, let me start at the beginning.

  Mrs. Claus is concerned that her husband is overworked and she wants to help.  He's still trying to keep up with all the new letters from kids as Christmas draws near and yet he won't let her read any -- they write to him so he will write back.  She has a plan to save him some time on his deliveries, but he's too busy to look at it, so she borrows the sleigh and reindeer to check it out for herself.  All is well until one of the reindeer, Cupid, pulls up lame in New York City.  She'll be stuck there for a week.

  This is not your usual Christmas romance -- though the Claus's are very devoted to one another and a young couple is showing signs of a budding relationship.  It is a musical -- basically a Broadway style musical, music and story by Jerry Herman (""Hello Dolly"" and many more).  I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, though I've seen some.  I do like the music and the story here.  You do get to see a slice of life as it was in New York City in 1910, and I found that interesting and enjoyable too.

  Is it a Christmas classic?  I think it is in that neighborhood, yes.  It's a shame that it's no longer easy to get a copy of this; fortunately I bought mine years ago.

  If you like Christmas, Santa, and a nice musical about people living long ago and very differently, you might well like this one.  Angela Lansbury is well supported by some very good actors, many of them kids, and many very good singers and dancers.",1420934400,,1557,4.147651006711409

195466,5,1574924451,"This made-for-TV movie is one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen.  I think it compares very well with the classic Christmas movies everyone knows, and deserves a spot with them (Charlie Brown, Magoo) on the list of annual films to watch during the season.

Why?  Well, Angela Lansbury, for one.  Perfectly cast, Lansbury is the extra grandmother you always wanted - and a triple threat: singer, dancer, and actress.  The many musical numbers are beautifully done, with clever lyrics, insanely catchy melodies, and a huge amount of Christmas spirit.

While a made-for-TV movie, the production values are high.  Some of the effects are obviously from the 90's, but other than that, you get a good sense that you are in early 1900's NYC, with all of the social movements and problems that entails.  You'd be surprised what you can learn (in a not very nuanced way, but then again this is a Christmas movie for children) about the time period and how people came together to fight certain causes.  However, this never distracts from the holiday cheer.

Buy this, but be warned....you'll then want to buy the soundtrack!",1362614400,2,1124,4.868421052631579

I had no idea of ""regions"" and while I have been able to watch it on the computer that is Not where I wanted to watch it. I think you should do more in pointing out about these regions for those, like me, who know nothing about them.

Region Codes other than US (Region 1, I think) should be displayed in a different product inventory.  I saw some reviews about not being able to play the DVD, etc. I suspect that the Region Code is the problem; put different regions in separate item - ITEM NAME - REGION #.

Angela Lansbury is as delightful as ever, and the movie is visually exciting in an old fashioned way. We need more of this type of entertainment instead of the junk that Hollywood has produced lately.",1168300800,2,328,4.875

The story line is believable, Mrs. Lansbury makes the movie. She gives (as usual) a flawless performance. I hope she does more projects.

195514,2,1574924451,"Let me start off by saying, I like Christmas movies. I watch them all year. I also like Hallmark movies. A few of them are among my favorites including, ""The Christmas Box"", ""Love Letter"" and ""Timepiece.""

  That being said, I'm not understanding all the rave reviews on here. The only reason this is getting 2 stars is because they belong to Angela Lansbury. She is her usual charming self and is a perfect Mrs. Claus......... for another movie. Even the song ""Avenue 'A'"" is good as is the choreography for it. Yes, the costumes are beautiful. But those three things don't make up for the bad story line, Charles Durning's bland and dismal portrayal of Santa and the other forgetable songs.

  The story is one of Mrs. Claus being tired of being overlooked and unappreciated. She gets stranded in New York and gets involved in a Votes for Women March. All well and good, except the storyline is poorly written and poorly put together. The reconcile with the ""grinch"" of the movie, Mr. Tavish, was the silliest thing I have ever seen. They built up a whole sotryline about this evil toymaker who works the children in his factory in horrid conditions. It all boils down to his brother stealing his Teddy Bear on Christmas when he was a boy and therefore he wanted to make Christmas miserable for every other child. Please! I know this is a Hallmark movie and a Christmas one but please give people some credit.

  Charles Durning is one of the last people I would pick to play Santa. If Santa was always portrayed in such a sour manner, he wouldn't be loved by millions. He hardly smiles, he's cranky and overworked and doesn't even notice that his wife hasn't been there for two days.

  I was dissapointed with this movie and I would not reccomend it. There are far, far better Christmas movies out there. Among them being, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (the 90's version), ""The Christmas Box"", ""One Magic Christmas"", ""The Santa Clause"", ""Christmas Eve on Sesame Street"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Holiday Inn"" and many, many more.",1130112000,13,2029,4.6845070422535215

195517,5,1574924451,"You can never go wrong with Angela Lansbury. I've always known it I guess, but, when you watch this movie and wish you still believed in Santa because of Mrs. Claus, it kind of reminds you!;)
 Really, the songs are terrific, and you can watch the movie over and over again! I watched it four or five times the first day I got it! It's just one of those movies you can memorize the dialouge for, and yet, still sit, watch, quote and enjoy!(Probably mostly due to Angela!)
 I was a little shocked at first that the movie was taking place in 1910, but the costumes were incredible! I especially loved the exquisite red dress ""Mrs. North"" (Mrs. Claus...Angela) wears at the Policemen's Charity Ball!!! Coincedentally, that's also when she sings one of the best songs in the film.
 The plot is easy to follow, and it really holds your attention. You just can't wait to see what Mrs. Claus will do next!",1055721600,8,897,4.49079754601227
195518,5,1574924451,"""Mrs. Santa Claus"" is a holiday musical delight that features Angela Lansbury (who else?) in the title role. In an attempt to try to imitate musicals of the '40s and '50s, Mrs. Santa Claus takes a spin with the sleigh and reindeer to test her new route Santa (Charles Durning). She becomes stranded in  New York City after Cupid is injured. She then becomes entranced and enchanted as she is now part of the world of Avenue ""A"". In New York, she becomes a sort of a governess at Tavish Toy Factory, where Tavish uses children for his toymakers. Why? It's like they're his slaves. She desparately tries to stop tavish in his tracks, and not have the children work in such conditions. At a Christmas party on Christmas Eve, Cupid is finally healed, because back home Santa, Arvo, the head elf (Michael Jeter) wonder and are worried about where she is at. Will she make it back in time? I'll let you in on a little secret...she does!! Then, Santa takes her this year on his annual trip! Kids will probably enjoy this one a lot!",1039564800,6,1024,4.475935828877005

Jerry Herman's music is classic especially songs like ""Avenue A"" and ""Whistle"".  If you really lesson carefully you will hear his trade-mark bridges in these songs.
It doesn't get any better than Angela, probably the most well respected lady in the business of stage and film. A true artist! The supporting cast is all very believable and do a great job gracing this film.
The film is far from serious and should be viewed as light hearted and just pure entertainment. The only thing i would have changed in this film would have been making some of the production numbers longer. It's a joy to watch.",1014076800,,750,4.5
195522,4,1574924451,"I absolutely adore Angela Lansbury and she is wonderful in this great Christmas flick.  What was the best, however, was Terrence Mann playing Augustus P. Tavish.  He did an excellent job at being slimey, oily, but charming all at once.  I have been a fan of his for a long time, and I wasn't disappointed with his performance.

  The ending happens too quickly and easily.  He receives a bear and all of the sudden, everything is okay!  Although this does occur, Terrence Mann handles it well.",1010620800,,493,4.651162790697675
195523,5,1574924451,"As we grow up we always hear about how great Santa Claus is. Keep in mind, I am not knocking the greatness of Santa, but it is always a wonder who the heck was Mrs Santa Claus? Now we know the woman behind the man.
I could not have thought of a better woman to play the part than Angela Lansbury. The former Queen of Broadway and the former J.B. Fletcher tells a beautiful story of how it is about time for the ""...World to know there's a Mrs. Santa Claus"".
The costumes in the movie were wonderfully fitting for the times and season; and yet not over the top. The two outfits designed by Emmy Award Nominee (for best Costumes) Bob Mackie that made Angela shine even brighter were the Policeman's ball gown and the ""sleigh ride"" outfit at the end of the film.
I thought the dancing was done superbly. It has been a long time since we, the public, have seen dancing in a made for t.v. movie. It is nice to revisit such an old friend.
The story about the Mrs wanting more attention, and the story of women's rights in the world of men, seem to have blended nicely. Most people would say that it is not the right time to discuss such problems at the most wonderful time of the year. I say the timing is correct and needed to help understand Anna's quest for more attention. Anna also proves that she is more than just ""the shadow behind the great man"". She proves to herself and the world that she does have some worth.
Charles Durning was delightful as Santa but slightly stiff. Terrance Mann was excellent as the ""grinch"" of Christmas. Overall the cast was 4 stars (out of 5).
The story was good; I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5. The costumes were 5 stars as was Angela Lansbury. The songs were cute and nicely done (4 out of 5 stars). But overall, it was 5 stars. I am slightly biased because I am a very BIG Angela Lansbury fan.
Angela makes for a wonderful Mrs Santa Claus that I cannot think of anyone else to have played Anna Claus. I am sure she was happy to get back to singing. Her voice still is strong even at 71.
This is one movie which should be played every Christmas. It is a Christmas standard to me and my family. I recommend it to anyone who loves Christmas.",1008979200,32,2177,4.2105263157894735

195525,5,1574924451,"MRS SANTA CLAUS is a delightful new musical starring one of Broadway's ""Grande Dames"", Angela Lansbury!
Mrs Santa Claus (Angela Lansbury) is tired ""of being the shadow behind the great man"" and takes the reindeer, three days before Christmas, on a little spin around the world.  Poor reindeer Cupid hurts his leg and she has to make an emergency stop in downtown New York (circa 1900's).
There she stays in ""Avenue A"", filled with colorful characters like stable boy Marcello (David Norona), feisty Sadie (Debra Wiseman) and Irish urchin Nora (Lynsey Bartilson).  While in New York she endears herself to the wonderful residents as Mrs North.
The Jerry Herman-penned songs are the tops with ""We Don't Go Together"", ""Whistle"", ""He Needs Me"", ""Mrs Santa Claus"" and many more.
Fantastic costumes by the always-dependable Bob Mackie and game support by Michael Jeter, Terrence Mann and Charles Durning all add fun to the proceedings.",988243200,17,929,5.105263157894737
195526,5,1574924451,"Here is a wonderful film that can be watched at any time of the year. The magnificant Angela Lansbury is at the top of her form in this delightful production. She proves once again why she is one of the top stars in any branch of entertainment. Most people do not realize that she is a wonderful singer. Not only does she sing beautifully, but unlike a lot of singers, she acts the song giving each one a special added dimension. She is a national treasure!!!!
The story is not complicated and it is obvious that all the loose ends will be tied up happily by the end of the film. Anyone looking for a ""meaningful"" story line should remember this is a family Christmas confection. It was never meant to be anything but a fun, happy music filled show and it succeeds admirably on all counts. Even if Charles Durning (a wonderful actor) is not a good singer, the whole cast is great.
Jerry Herman provides his signature ""can't get them out of your mind"" songs. ""Avenue A"" makes you want to dance around the room with the performers.
Pop a bowl of popcorn, grab a soft drink, forget the ""real"" word and enter the fantasy land of Christmas and Mrs. Santa Claus. Unless you are really a Scrooge, you won't regret it.",969235200,5,1210,4.40625

Somehow things morphed into a Christmas-themed musical. There's a B-story about women's suffrage, yet the movie is set earlier, as it was determined that costumes of an earlier era would be more flattering for Ms. Lansbury at this stage.
