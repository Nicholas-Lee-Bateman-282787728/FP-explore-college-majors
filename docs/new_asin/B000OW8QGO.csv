8186988,5,B000OW8QGO,Of all the 6teen dvds I got this is my #1 favorite. Nikki sales sucks at the Khaki barn and her manager can't get her in line until she is made employee of the month and brain washes her into behaving like the other clones.  Then when Jen wants to make a new employee jealous so he will act her out she has Jude pretend to be her date at the business party which turns the party upside down in humor as well as show some signs of romance between Joney and Nikki.  Finally Nikki keeps putting down this band holding auditions for a new musical video until she is chosen for the video based on her dance style and look making the other girls jealous.,1231027200,,648,4.134920634920635
