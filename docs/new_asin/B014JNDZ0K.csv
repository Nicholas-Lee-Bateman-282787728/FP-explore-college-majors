7413789,5,B014JNDZ0K,"I was expecting this to be a more traditionally scripted movie, kind of like the Smosh film, but this has a more Jackass feeling which works much better considering Caspar and Joe's characters.
I think this will be a hit!",1446508800,7,221,4.55

7413796,2,B014JNDZ0K,"I'm a huge Joe & Caspar fan, I love their videos and collaborations, their friend group, etc. However, this film was so forced and poorly acted, clearly scripted yet trying to act natural and candid. It hurt to watch and make it through, and is nothing like the Joe & Caspar I've come to know and love. This honestly isn't worth your time, there are no real ""haha"" moments from it, and I'll never get this hour and a half back.",1449446400,2,427,4.283950617283951
7413797,4,B014JNDZ0K,"Awesome movie, boys. It was funny, and weird, and completely you two. I don't know what I expected, but that wasn't it. It was wonderful though. I do prefer your videos and vlogs though, they do feel more authentic and more of your personalities shine through. Definitely worth the wait though!",1448582400,,294,4.784313725490196

8730986,5,B014JNDZ0K,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!,1491696000,,22,6.666666666666667
8730987,5,B014JNDZ0K,"I see many reviews giving the movie low ratings because the disc cannot be played on American dvd players. That's, sort of, what prompted me to write a review. I will admit that when I ordered the movie, I didn't realize the format of the dvd was not made for the US (region 1). But after looking it up online, I was able to reformat my dvd player with a few simple steps, and the player was set up for the correct region (2). I don't know how easy it is on other players, but I have one of the cheap and simple Samsung models. Plus, I was able to switch it back to the regular region when I was finished just as quickly. If I had given up on the movie without doing a little research, my review certainly would have been like the other negative reviews. I'm glad I took the time.

With the technical issues out of the way, I enjoyed the movie. I am an avid viewer of both Joe's and Caspar's videos, and the personalities, actions, and jokes made throughout the movie felt sincere, and not at all scripted. You could tell they had fun filming, and I cannot wait to watch their newest one coming out, Hit the Road USA, which- IS OFFERED IN THE RIGHT FORMAT! So there shouldn't be any issues with that one. I don't know why they never did this before.",1480982400,,1249,4.182572614107884
