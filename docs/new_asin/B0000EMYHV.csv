1938283,5,B0000EMYHV,I HAVE SEEN THE ORIGINAL IN THE 60'S AND ALSO BOUGHT ALL OF THE VHS TAPES.  NOW I AM UPGRADING TO DVD AND CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE AND OR QUALITY OF THIS ON DVD.,1322524800,,171,3.6216216216216215
1938284,5,B0000EMYHV,"I purchased this collection from a seller on amazon and am kind of curious if this is some kind of advanced copy. When I first opened it I noticed it did not have the collectors postcard and its in a different case then the other collections. The coloring and pic on the back of the insert are all very dark. The disc look like orignals , no purple bottoms like dvd+r. I stuck in the disc to watch and the quality is worse then usual, Pic is flickering like its been compressed. I stuck it in the computer to check the dvd size and these are on single layer disc and the first 9 are all dual layer disc. So does anyone know if someone can do advance copying?  I would hate to complain and this be just the way this collection is. Let me know if anyone has any suggestions ? I love this show. Long live Dark Shadows!!!!!!!!!!",1308960000,4,824,4.15
1938285,5,B0000EMYHV,"More Nicholas Blair with some of the best scenes of his here that culminate in collection 11. I love this character and I appreciate his ability to move the plot the way he does. So many convolutions occur here what with the who's biting who, who's going to be the life force, Vicky Winters & Jeff Clarke, Adam & Carolyn's growing relationship, Maggie Evans in the mix again, and the wicked, imperious Eve, not to mention Elizabeth Stoddard's curse. Lots to chew on here... I whizzed through it in no time.",1304294400,,506,4.571428571428571
1938286,3,B0000EMYHV,"But, you have to get through it to continue with the story so I soldiered on and skipped a bit. The Adam storyline continues as he threatens to harm Victoria unless Barnabas and Julia create a mate for him - Eve. But some woman has to contribute the life force to create Eve and Warlock Nicholas Blair first puts Carolyn Stoddard on the table, and when that doesn't work he rounds up the ghost of an infamous murderess from the French Revolution. Eve is created and is none too interested in her mate Adam, she's much more interested in Jeff Clark who she recognizes from her past - but he doesn't recognize her. Yawn.

Willie Loomis kidnaps Maggie Evans for her own protection (Barnabas wanted to use her as the life force for Eve), but with unintended results - the memory of her ordeal at the hands of Barnabas returns in full force. The only real highlights of these episodes are when Lara Parker is allowed to chew up the scenery biting the necks off of Jeff Clark, Joe Haskell and eventually taking a swing at Barnabas himself. After all this time why no on in town recognizes the sign of being under a vampire's spell after all this time is beyond me...

Oh well, these are now over and I can move onto the next. Hopefully Quentin will be appearing soon. Please?",1299369600,4,1269,4.44206008583691
1938287,5,B0000EMYHV,This is a great DVD!  This show is a lot better than the realty shows they have on today!,1292716800,,89,3.6842105263157894
1938288,4,B0000EMYHV,"Because ""xyz"" did not have copy ten, I made a 2 second decision to buy copy 10/11. Amazon has a good price on both of these. When one is addicted...... This is the same ongoing story about the Collins family. Most of the actor's are as dedicated to their roles as I am to Dark Shadows. The love stories are an aside to the gothic horror/mystery.
I groan everytime Angelique shows up again. If there is a way to get rid of vampires, there has to be a way to get rid of witches also. She is such a bad one. There is entertainment everywhere whether it be the story, missed lines, change of clothes for no reason in a scene (bloopers)or what new fantasy characture will be introduced next.",1284163200,,686,4.2846153846153845
1938289,5,B0000EMYHV,"Things really heat up in this collection 10 dvd from beginning to end. Major spotlights Elizabeths' death dream sequence Eves' arrival and her disdain towards Adam and her obsession of Jeff Clark whom she remembers as Peter Bradford, a past love. However this pales in comparison to Angeliques' attack on Barnabas, which causes him to be under her power and Nicolas slapping Eve in the face because of her sarcasm towards him. Top all that with great special effects and spooky moments and you have yourself a winner here.",1244937600,,522,4.876404494382022
1938290,5,B0000EMYHV,This is one of the best so far in the series. I really love it!!Cant wiat to get more.,1225843200,,86,3.5789473684210527
1938291,4,B0000EMYHV,"In the Dark Shadows DVD Collection 10, we continue with the story of Adam. Adam was a being created by Dr. Lang and Dr. Houffman to cure Barnabas of vamperism (similar to Frankenstein's monster). After discovering that his love, Carolyn, does not love him, Adam looks for a way to have Carolyn love him. The evil warlock, Nicholas Blair, uses Adam's want for Carolyn to love Adam to corrupt Adam. Nicholas even corrupts Adam enough to demand that a mate be created for Adam. Nicholas chooses the spirit of Danielle, an infamous murder from the French Revolution, to be the lifeforce.

Nicholas's plan to create a super human race with Adam as the father seems to be working. As Nicholas corrupts Adam from one side, Eve corrupts him from the other.

If you have watched the previous Dark Shadows DVD collections, this is of course a great way to follow through the story.",1093737600,9,871,4.686274509803922
1938292,4,B0000EMYHV,"With this DVD set, the story of Adam accelerates as he forces Barnabas and Julia to bring his mate, Eve, to life.  Lots of powerplay between Nicholas Blair allied with Adam and Barnabas allied with Julia and Professor Stokes.  There are subplots aplenty, one particularly nerve-racking one involving Maggie Evans beginning to regain her memory of what Barnabas did to her way back in DVD Collection 2.  Things also really begin to get good between Barnabas and Angelique, now a vampire, in this set.  For John Karlen fans, these episodes are from a period in which he appeared on the show quite a lot (fans will know that he was known to leave the show for months at a time), meaning that Willie sees a lot of screen time.  All in all, its a good collection with episodes from a pretty good DS storyline, though, in my opinion it pales in comparison with whats to come next DVD, the beginning of Quentin Collins' haunting of Collinwood.  Of course, this is a great set for fans of DS and a must-have for those collecting the DVDs.  For those who have never seen the show but are into cult/quirky gothic fantasy, I highly recommend you pick up these DVDs.  The Adam and Eve story will reach its conclusion with the next release, and Quentin Collins played by fan-favorite David Selby will make his first appearances as the DVDs head into the episodes that comprised Dark Shadows' most successful days.",1075507200,33,1400,4.6396761133603235
1938303,4,B0000EMYHV,"Basically more of the same plotting, betrayal by Angelique, Adam, warlock Nick Blair,Dr. Hoffman,Willie Loomis, et al.

Roger Collins, her brother is still convinced that Elisebeth Collins Stoddard is mentally ill & unstable and she should be immeadiately returned to The Mental Institutional clinic White Cliff. She Liz that is confides in Barnabas Collins that her dear family members tend to bury her prematurely before she's even dead!  Dr. Hoffman & Barnabas Collins set out to create a female mate for the lonely Adam & they call her Eve.

Angelique tries to kill Adam but Nichalis Blair intervenes & stops her from casting a spell on Adam. And Angelique's spell then back fires on her and she reverts to being a creature of the night a vampire like Barnabas was.  David Collins plays Dr. Eric lang's tape recorder back & stumbles upon the secret room in the Collins Moseluem in the private cemetery grounds.  And on & on the saga of Dark shadows goes.... I give this dvd collection 4 stars",1434240000,,996,4.8011695906432745

1938305,5,B0000EMYHV,"Really good part of the Adam storyline, but barnabas isn't as interesting when he's not a vampire.",1418256000,,98,4.823529411764706
1938306,4,B0000EMYHV,"Up to now, the Adam storyline was beginning to get stale, but now the story starts picking up again.  Now that Angelique is a vampire, her story takes on another twist.  When Maggie is kidnapped by Willie, she begins to remember that Barnabas had kidnapped her months earlier and she realizes what Barnabas is.  A very interesting DVD.",1416355200,,335,4.741379310344827

1938309,5,B0000EMYHV,I've loved Dark Shadows since I was a small child and it was originally on ABC. It's great to be able to have it on DVD to see over and over again. Amazon has a great selection and wonderful pricing. Deliveries always come packaged very well and are delivered very promptly. Thanks!,1391990400,,282,4.4423076923076925
1938310,5,B0000EMYHV,"I watched Dark Shadows as a kid and was intrigued with the series.  There were many things on the show I didn't understand, but I continued to watch. One day my child-care provider introduced the series to me and I was hooked ever since. Never, had I known or seen the ending, so this is my chance to see it all over again with a more understanding of the series. Because of these DVDs, I was able to attend my first Dark Shadow Festival in Brooklyn, NY, the year before Jonathan Frid past.  I got to meet Lara Parker, David Selby, Jerry Lacy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Roger Davis, and many others because of these DVD's. Thanks Amazon.",1388793600,,632,4.3931623931623935
