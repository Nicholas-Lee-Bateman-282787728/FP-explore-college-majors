While a couple of the stories managed to step it up and give the audience something special, the overall theme of the series got played out very early and left this volume with a real letdown and no satisfaction. This has been a long journey to confirm what my initial instincts told me, this series is not worth the effort.",1213833600,,467,4.379310344827586
