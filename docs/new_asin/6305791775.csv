1069806,5,6305791775,"The first time i heard of this movie was when it was a preview in another video.  The ""Why you hit my hair"" line was all it had to take for me and my friend to go rent it.  The story was simple and down to earth.  It was just hilarious to see all the ""Style"" during those days.  It reminds me of my dad back then.
Throughout the whole movie it gave  me continuous laughs.  It's a lot better to watch this movie with friends.  I liked it so much that i rented it again so my parents could watch it.  They enjoyed it as well.
And one of the girls, Julie , is so cute and  pretty.",963792000,2,577,3.7815126050420167
1069807,5,6305791775,"This is what I call a sleeper hit!  It's such an amusing movie that I watched a rental several times before returning it.  Now I have to get a copy for myself!  The dialogue is cute, the women are gorgeous, the guys  are funny, and the disco dance numbers are great!  It's now one of my  all-time favorites!",963187200,5,307,4.206896551724138
1069808,5,6305791775,"I had no idea ""That's the way I like it"" was going to become one of my most favorite movies of all time.  It was hillarious, sweet and exciting and, wow, these people can dance disco! The soundtrack was  amazing, the story was simple yet also touched on life's complexities.  After I write this review I'm going to get myself a copy of this movie and  the soundtrack.  Gotta watch it over and over again.",959731200,3,404,4.333333333333333
1069809,4,6305791775,"This movie was hilarious. With the silliness of disco, and some over done real life issues, it was very entertaining. The acting is pretty decent. It was very fresh to see the effects of disco in 70's Singapore. An  entertaining film for the family(not to young).",953683200,3,263,4.717391304347826
1069923,5,6305791775,You will love this disco singapore version of Saturday Night fever. There is no bad language nor open sexual graphics.,1358812800,,118,4.95
1069924,5,6305791775,"When I first saw this movie I was captured, I myself was born and grew up in Singapore and this brings back the old Singapore, in fact one scene is around the corner from where I lived",1353542400,,184,4.0
1069925,5,6305791775,"I first saw this movie on the indie channel while channel surfing one afternoon. The movie title caught my attention so I decided to see what it was about. After watching the movie I noticed that there are a few similar scenes throughout that came close to another movie about dancing at a local disco which premiered in theaters in 1977 and based in Brooklyn, New York. I found myself enjoying so much that I decided to purchase the DVD from Amazon. The movie was cute, funny, and enjoyable. What made this movie really interesting was the fact that since I am a big fan of the movie ""Saturday Night Fever"" and noticed one similar scene in the movie was when Hock aka ""Tony"" had come home late for dinner (due to his bicycle was smashed by another character in the movie)and his mother starts yelling at him (remember this scene from SNF?) for being late. His sister starts a fight with Hock at the dinner table by throwing something at him and his father becomes upset and begins to smack Hock in the back of the head. Hock then states a similar phrase about ""how he had spent $30.00 on his hair and all his father does is hit his hair"". This movie is definitely worth seeing for anyone who is a fan of Saturday Night Fever!!",1336003200,,1227,4.385964912280702
1069926,5,6305791775,Hilarious movie that looks at what life was like in the 60s & 70s. Mind you only those who live in Spore or Malysia can understand the jokes & inunendous. The characters are reflections of what I used to experinced when I was a teenager. Even my Vietnamese friends enjoy the movie as they have been to both countries.,1310342400,,317,4.389830508474576
1069927,5,6305791775,"This is such a great movie!  I can't say enough about it.  I can see alot of guys might be turned off by the disco dancing cover, but don't let that deter you.  I got my cousin who mainly watches gangsta flicks to watch it and he loved it!  It's got comedy, drama, action, romance, and some really cool/funny dance scenes. One of my favorite movies of all time.  I absolutely had to get the DVD and so got it here off of Amazon.",1292803200,,428,4.0476190476190474
1069928,4,6305791775,"This movie is pretty good. At first I thought it was a little corny, but after sitting through it I started to like it. I recommend this film to people who are fans of Saturday Night Fever.",1226448000,,189,4.135135135135135
1069929,5,6305791775,"It's hard to believe that its been almost ten years since this movie came out. I fondly remember watching it in the theaters in Singapore with my sister, and what an experience that was: That's the Way I Like It (as it is also known) was one of the few movies so far to elicit loud laughs and cheers there, and subsequently get picked up for international distribution. A great feat for a film industry that is still quite young! I'm hoping that a ten year anniversary DVD with special features is on the horizon.

Despite being a ""foreign film"", Forever Fever is remarkably accessible to audiences of every type. (Even though I grew up in Singapore, I write this now from my current home of New York City). Sure, a knowledge of regional slang and mannerisms make up a good part of the pleasure of watching this film -- it's unique cultural slant ensured that it was a hit among Singaporean audiences. But the broad quality of Forever Fever (and the mark of good, entertaining filmmaking) is it's ability to resonate emotionally with audiences of all different cultures, and in different time periods. By setting his film during the peak of disco fever, director Glen Goei establishes a common focal point for the international market. In turn, although most viewers will not be accustomed to Singapore of the 1970's and all it's Asian nuances, the story of lead character Hock (Adrian Pang) and friends translates excellently, even through the occasional Singlish or Hokkien. Particular praise to the team as well for tastefully (and somewhat daringly) incorporating the story of Hock's brother Leslie.

On that subject of 'translation', I will say that the distributor could've done a better job with the subtitles in this particular DVD release. When Hock's grandmother gets her line in (and a punchline, to boot), we are only offered a maddening ""Speaking Chinese"" to explain. This also happens during certain easily translatable Singlish phrases; either that, or it doesn't quite hit the mark (for instance, ""shiok"" means 'good', not 'sure'). I am also glad that they dropped the idea of re-dubbing the actor's voices as Americans. This is demonstrated in the international trailer on the disc, and it would've paradoxically undermined the international appeal and uniqueness of the movie.

Put that minor point aside, though. You won't be disappointed with this DVD, and it is all the more reason to call for a jam-packed re-release, too. Forever Fever is a benchmark of Singaporean cinema and a highly enjoyable film. Glen Goei comments on love, dance, family, and Asian values through the prism of disco's import into Singapore and the universally relevant stories of his endearing characters -- consequently, he and his team have created a film that charmingly exports a nostalgic slice of the country's past and ubiquitous ideals to the world.",1208908800,,2853,4.989495798319328
1069930,5,6305791775,"I don't know how I ended up with this film, but I loved it.  It was a really sweet story, and having lived in Singapore for a bit, I loved hearing the Singlish spoken by the characters.  But, it was also a very enjoyable movie, with lots of twists and turns, some predictable, others not - some very funny moments and some very touching scenes.  Overall, it wasn't Oscar material, but it is a great movie to just watch and have a good time.",1166313600,,440,4.214285714285714
1069931,5,6305791775,"First off, I would like to say I am not a fan of comedy movies. My favorite genre is horror and the few comedy movies I do like are usually mean-spirited. I would also say I am not big on dancing, especially disco (sorry i'm a Gen X'er). I do like martial arts, but let's face it, this movie is presenting itself as a dancing movie, and the fighting is a very small aspect of the movie.

I honestly would have never watched this movie, if I had not been forced to. This is one of those movies that wouldn't even catch my eye in the video store. Movie about about dancing and disco? HAHAHAHA ...never in a million years. It is so ironic that my reaction to being forced to watch this movie mirrored that of the main character Hock, as his friends forced him to sit through the dancing movie ""Forever Fever"". Like him, contempt slowly turned to interest, and by the end of the movie I was really ""digging it"".

There are many laugh out loud moments as Hock joins dancing classes so that he can win a disco competition to buy the motorcycle of his dreams. He has many obstacles in his way, learning to dance, his manager at work, the SOB boyfriend of the girl he is chasing and his slightly askew family. But in the end, with a little help from his guardian angel, he learns the more important things in life.

I love this movie, and after renting it for the fourth time from the local video store, I decided I might as well buy it. This movie has alot of heart and humor. The romance aspect of it was also warming. So to all you normal males, too macho to watch a film about dancing, give this movie a chance, see it with your girl, you won't be sorry.",1134086400,2,1650,4.198738170347003
1069932,4,6305791775,"A delightful film from Singapore with english spoken dialogue. A spoof of ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" thats full of humor and fun.

A great rental and fun one to own.",1125878400,,161,4.551724137931035
1070001,5,6305791775,"When Hock's friends drag him to see some funky dance movie, it's kicking and screaming. Yet one glimpse into disco's glitzy nightlife and he ditches his Bruce Lee obsession for a pair of bell-bottoms and permed hair. It's ""Saturday Night Fever"" all over again, from the butterfly collars to the sweaty dance-offs, but put a little Asian spin on, add a touch of spoof, sprinkle it with some dry humor and top it off with an advice-giving John Travolta look alike... well, could it get more fun than that?

 Frankly, it wasn't as campy as it might sound. They didn't take it over the top, but kept it within the genre of ""very good film,"" instead of making it slapstick. They dealt with some serious issues in relationships that seemed more real than devised for cinema. The acting wasn't always perfect, but the athleticism of the dancing was incredible, and the storyline was entertaining and actually refreshingly unique.

 If you're a fan of the independent comedy, this is a great one.",1090281600,5,988,4.760233918128655
1070002,5,6305791775,"Hey everyone, Just wanted to say thank you for all of the amazing reviews.

1070003,5,6305791775,"The story takes place in Singapore in the age of disco.  Hock is an employee in a supermarket who idolizes Bruce Lee. One night Hock goes to the movies with his friends and see Saturday Night Fever and is exposed to the magic of disco.  Hock's dream is to buy a motorcycle, so when he finds an ad for a dance competition, he decides to enter a dance school with his friend Mei.  However, he doesn't have any skill in dancing, so he goes to see the movie again to pick up some pointers.  Hock is shocked when Travolta's character walks out of the screen to give him some advice.  With this gaurdian angel's guidance, Hock works hard to become the greatest dancer in Singapore.  In the meantime, Mei is falling in love with Hock, but Hock is falling for another girl at the dance school.  Also there is a sub-plot in which Hock's brother announces his intention to get a sex change, which causes a lot of family problems.  Can Hock win the competition?  Watch and find out.
This movie is excellent.  It covers several genres--comedy, action, romance, and drama, and it delivers in every area.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.",1064707200,5,1136,4.519607843137255
1070004,5,6305791775,"The movie arrived yesterday. Watched it and fell in love with it.
It was great seeing Asian actors in non stereotyped roles.  It was funny but the actors / actresses Singaporean accents sounded like they were speaking with a Hawaiian accent.
I found out about this movie inadvertently through [a website].  Can't even remember why I surfed through that site, but I am really glad that I did.  This will be a movie that I will watch again and again when I need laughs and want to see a romantic comedy.
This movie took me ""back to the time"".  It reminded me of the Asian nightclubs that we frequented back in San Francisco.
I could really relate to the characters as people that I grew up with in the Bay Area.",1059523200,4,709,4.3893129770992365
1070005,5,6305791775,"This movie will be thoroughly enjoyable if it is not taken seriously.  One gets the feeling watching it that sometimes the actors are making up their own dialogue, but it is entertaining.  The dance sequences are very good, and there is a Adrian Pang and Medaline Tan and Annabelle Francis all have believable relationships with each other, be it attraction, or commpetition.  The actors all fit the parts, and it doesn't feel like it was tailored to any actor's whims.  As it was produced by Singaporeans, if that is a word, it doesn't present stereotypes.  There are places where the props break the period, such as some of the 90's packages in the supermarket, but that is unavoidable in a place like Singapore where everything is torn down every few years...there are no '70s places left.
This movie is definitely worth a look.",1031788800,9,831,4.783216783216783

If you are buying this movie just for the parts about bruce lee don't buy it. It hardly has anything about bruce lee.,1003795200,,356,3.824324324324324
1070009,4,6305791775,"I saw this movie in New York and I left the cinema with the broadest grin.
The acting is not polished but is possessed of a rare earnestness. The script is not innovative (it's a reworked Saturday Night Fever) but is simple, uncontrived and full of heart. There's plenty of fun and plenty of dancing in this movie.
I think the director has also lovingly recreated Singapore in the 70s - which will be a great nostalgia trip for some of you. That was the other gem in this movie for me - the time travelling back to the Singapore of director Glenn Goei's childhood perhaps?",978393600,5,572,4.40566037735849

Although we saw it for free, we all felt short changed and ripped off.  Perhaps in my top 10 worst films ever.  Had nothing going for it.  Bad acting, unfunny jokes, and they couldn't not even license John Travolta's likeness!

We were given a survey form at the end of the film, the last question was ""What was your favorite part of the film""?

My answer: ""The ending credits"".
