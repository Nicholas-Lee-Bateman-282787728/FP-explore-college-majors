8010735,2,B0001DMW8E,"The best part of this DVD is the picture on the cover. The girl, Julie Delarme, is a beautiful waif, but unfortunately the director doesn't really do anything with her part of the story. The main protagonist, Simon, is supposedly a modern-day version of Simon the Magician (but good hearted) from the New Testament; but the actor is utterly unconvincing in the role, and more importantly the character is just empty of any interest. The plotting is disappointing, the characters are unbelievable and undeveloped. In the hands of someone like David Lynch, the concept of the film could have been made into something interesting, but this is only boring.",1401494400,,652,4.990825688073395
8010736,5,B0001DMW8E,"Movies are about letting your self go and letting go is a technique worth developing. The fewer considerations you have about life the better (that is the real key). As a matter of fact that is what makes life worth enjoying.

This movie/music ""Simon the Magician"" took me from beginning to end. If, I said that this movie was sweet, you might get the wrong idea, as in sugar sweet, it was not. It was sweet as in it touched my heart from beginning to end.
(Come for the movie not the quality of the transfer.)
Bravo to those who made this movie one and all!
Thanks for reading.  David Farmer",1375056000,,592,4.324324324324325

It's incomplete in so many ways - and yes, I see that as one of it's strengths.  In that way, I am reminded of the movie 'Tootsie' and Bill Murray's character.  He plays Jeff, a playwright, and while discussing the nature of his art, Jeff says, ""I don't like when somebody comes up to me the next day and says, ""Hey, man, I saw your play. It touched me; I cried."" I like it when a guy comes up to me a week later and says, ""Hey, man, I saw your play... what happened?""

To me, that line of dialogue sums up Simon the Magician (and in more than one way).  ""What happened?""

Well basically it will be up to you to decide, though that's part of the fun, I believe.

Personally, I found the characters to be peculiar and charming and surreal.  The same goes for the plot, that is to say, what plot there is, for in truth there's very little.  But again, for me, that's one of the film's strengths, as it's magic lies in it's mood, it's atmosphere.

Put another way, the whole thing drifts like fog across a field, and if you let go, you'll find yourself slowly floating along with it, going no place in particular and yet, everywhere.  Personally, I loved it.  But then again, I love fog.

To state any more might make my review too complete, and so, to honor Simon, I'll leave the rest unsaid.",1304553600,2,1426,4.237037037037037
8010738,5,B0001DMW8E,"I normally ONLY write book reviews as I am a publisher and amateur writer; in this case I had to make an exception as I truly adore this movie. (Disclaimer; I might be bias as I am an aficionado of esoterica and magic. That is why I have rented it from Netflix.. It is possible that if you are not into these things as I am, you might feel differently!)

This is a movie about true miracles versus ""the phenomena"" for the sake of it. The essence of the movie is the opposing characters of the two and resurrection versus hibernation. Peter is all about effort, he is standing on his head to show off and become the star, while Simon is a natural he draws people to him, with calming and healing qualities. People, who naturally savor phenomena often forsaking and missing the true miracles of life that often masquerades as happenstance or luck. The love affair is also a sideshow to see the glimpse of the ending from the mirror of the girl's eyes. A truly visual and esoteric movie. Full with symbolism of sleep, nature's magic and love and redemption.",1290211200,4,1054,4.461139896373057
8010739,3,B0001DMW8E,"There remains an air of somber and mysterious feeling throughout this French movie.  It is quiet, lacks an intrusive soundtrack, and occasionally, we see stunning a panoramic view of Paris.  The film lacks color, but it is not in black and white, just that gritty appearance enhancing the somber mood.

Hungarian, Simon the  magician, is summoned by police to solve a murder.  The man arrives and with the aid of a translator, and he requires a biologist and some high-tech equipment to analyze the house plant's energy and said the plant will identify the killer.

He solves the murder and  tries to escape anymore unwanted publicity, as he prefers to be alone in his work.  He also falls into these trance-like sleeps almost anywhere he is at the time.

Simon, in his mid-to late 50's, falls for a very young college girl who was conducting surveys on the street.  The two are attracted.

Meanwhile, a rival magician connects with Simon the magician to challenge him to a duel.  The two are to be buried underground for 3 days.  The rival magician has a system that uses the ""bear's brain"" technique that will allow him to remain underground in this Houdini-type challenge and his plan is methodically layed out.

The two are tested by medical professionals, both put underground and monitored. Then, you will see which one survives, and the outcome of the relationship.

This is a rather strange film, but one continues to discover the outcome of the crazy plan ....Rizzo",1137456000,3,1474,4.816733067729084
8010740,2,B0001DMW8E,"Note: Original languages are French/Hungarian with English subtitles.

Very slow story that doesn't deliver in the end. An updated version of the apocryphal confrontation between Jesus and Simon the Magician, this Simon lives in modern day Hungary and comes to France to work with the French police on a murder case. During his stay he solves the crime, falls in love with a young girl and renews an acquaintance with an old rival who challenges him to a test of magical power. They both agree to be buried alive for three days and see who is powerful enough to survive.

You keeping waiting for something to happen but it never does. With such a wonderfully original concept it could have been a great film, but this movie proves that a good idea doesn't equal a good movie.",1113004800,33,775,4.649635036496351
