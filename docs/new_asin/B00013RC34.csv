1969414,3,B00013RC34,"Although the premise seems amusing (""Green Acres"" for the MTV generation), it seems to have backfired. Instead of being laughed at, Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie only succeed in making fun of the people in this country who work very hard to keep a roof over their heads and food on their tables, and it's not funny at all. This program can't be reality, because no two human beings could really be so stupid as these two act. It is hard to tell the difference between wealth and poverty here, based on the behavior of these two women. They act as though they have had no education beyond the second grade (their misspelling of the word ""booger"" on a fast-food message board or failure to know what taxes are); they demonstrate no acceptable social skills in manners or etiquette (they ignore people to whom they are being introduced and fail to clean up after themselves in their host's home); and their behavior is impulsive, immature, awkward and obnoxious (whether it's flipping off passersby or intimidating their host brother's ex-girlfriend outside a bar bathroom). After seven weeks, these completely oblivious, self-serving ditzes return to their posh lifestyles, saying goodbye to their hosts, the hard-working people who represent the very foundation of this county, with a wave of their famous ""fingers."" Fox: next time, dump them deep in the woods, so Bigfoot will be the only one that has to be subjected to their pompous, selfish lives. I have a better idea for a reality show for these girls...dump them into the middle of Rodeo Drive and tell them they've been cut-off by Daddy...that should make for extremely entertaining viewing.",1071878400,13,1650,4.938848920863309
1969415,5,B00013RC34,"This simple is a reality version of the 1960s sitcom ""Green Acres,"" with a few twists.
Hotel Heiress Paris Hilton and her best friend Nicole Richie star as two uber-spoiled rice young 20 something girls from L.A..  All there life they have lived in posh environments moving from Beverly Hills, to the Upper-East Side, to Paris, to London, and back to Beverly Hills.
This show follows the girls on there adventures to a farm in the middle of nowhere.  Now the girls must survive with no credit cards, no cell phones, and no Gormay Food.
Throughout there month on the farm, they try to addampt to there new surroundings but fail miserablly in ever respect from getting jobs, to crufue, to walking-up before the sun and so on.
I wasn't interested in this series from the previews, but the night it aired there was NOTHING else on, so i watched it, and boy im glad, because I did not stop laughing the intire half hour.  This DVD is going to be a must buy for my comedy collection, and it will included over 20 minutes of (not allowed to be aired scenes)... sounds like another laughing riot.
Fox and Warner Brother's Television are the industry leaders in TV shows on DVD, and all I have to say is ""Keep up the good work""",1070496000,7,1218,4.452914798206278

1969535,5,B00013RC34,"The Simple Life has Paris Hilton and Nichole Richie doing odd jobs, and living with a family in a very small town, very diffrent from Los Angeles. This was probably the best season of the Simple Life, because it built up and stayed. I have watched all 5 seasons, and this one byfar is my favorite. Only for the reason the story builds and keeps going until the end. You will come to see in the next few seasons they might stay at a house for 1-2 nights then leave, this was just more interesting because they had to stay for the 28 days.

I like that this show is totally what I would do, if I was rich and spoiled like them. They sort of do the things that we cannot, and thats what makes this so entertaining. I think they got fired from almost every job on the show, however that is the beauty of it. It simply is funny, and simple. Though we cant afford to do what we want and get fired from our jobs, they could because this was a temporary thing for them, they had other opportunities lined up. All in all it is great, relaxing fun. This is one thing I watch before bed that is enjoyable.

I'd argue if you are a girly girl you would love this show, I know I did. Even if not, most people I have talked to like it. They have funny pranks, and the girls are just cute.",1400803200,,1273,4.0476190476190474

Heaven knows if they'll survive

Where the hell are we?!

Before Snooki and Co. ran amuck on the Jersey Shore and the Klassy Kardashians became E! darlings, there was Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie on The Simple Life. The 2003 Fox ""reality"" show followed the hotel heiress (along with her pet chiuaua Tinkerbell) and wild child daughter of singer Lionel Richie as they traded in their cushy L.A. surroundings for a month of down home farm living in the small town of Altus, Arkansas: population 807.

With no cellphones or credit cards and a rickety old pickup truck as their only source of transportation, the girls move in with the Ledings, a rural deeply religious Catholic family who intend to teach the socialites the importance of hard work. Needless to say, it doesn't go over so well.

Paris and Nicole work a host of jobs and manage to fail miserably at nearly all of them: bottling milk on a dairy farm, waitressing at a Sonic Drive-in (I'll leave it at ""Half Price Anal Salty Weiner Bugers""), and counting cattle at a livestock auction to name a few. They also skip out on their household chores and ignore their midnight curfew for some late night clubbin'.

Dad Albert does his best to reign them in, but he's pretty much a pushover. Mom Janet is a bit more stern, but even she can't keep the girls or the family from becoming the center of town gossip. Despite all the drama, it's obvious the Ledings (especially Grandma Curly and little Braxton) care for Paris and Nicole and are sad to see them go when the month is up. Well maybe not too sad, but you know what I mean.

Nicole totally makes the show. Her crazy antics and one-liners are equally hilarious and appalling. Paris is relegated to sauntering around in trashy outfits alternating between her baby coo and montone man voice dropping her trademark ""that's hot"", but she has a few comedic moments here and there. Speaking of Miss Hilton, the Penfifteen Club song of the same name gets old quick. It's nice enough, but I don't need to hear ""Ms. Hilton you must be worth a trillion bucks/ I get the feelin' that you don't really give a...."" in every episode. Ugh.

Extras include an unaired pilot of the girls making a big mess of a job at a local dog grooming business and outtakes of a taxidermist (which should've made the show) and vet job. A short clip of Paris and her sister Nicki packing for the trip to Arkansas is downright boring and proof that the original idea of the younger Hilton doing the show rather than Nicole would've been a big mistake.

It's certainly not life changing tv, but The Simple Life is fun to laugh at. So if you're bored, pop it in and enjoy.",1295740800,2,2938,4.561669829222011
1969562,5,B00013RC34,"I loved this series.  It's basically mindless fun to watch these two girls go on adventures.

Whatch them turn the little country city of Altus upsidedown and making new friends by learning the meaning of family tradition.
This pack contains the entire first season plus extras like missing videos, funny stories and even a preview of what was about to come like Paris and her sister Nikki packing for the trip. It's a SHAME it DOESN'T have the SIMPLE LIFE REUNION as well.

After seeing it not too long ago (along with the other seasons), I see the obvious humor.  Knowing that this is a reality TV show, however, also made me a little sickened to see the supposedly innocent participants with Paris and Nicole go along with whatever their task at hand was.

Paris Hilton, famous for being famous, and Nicole Richie, daughter of pop star Lionel Ritchie, are transported from their glamorous Hollywood lives to live on a farm in Arkansas with a rural family.  Classic fish out of water scenes will emerge, having to deal with rural life verses city life.  What is really unbelievable is how Paris and Nicole have never had to do even the most trivial of mundane tasks, like pumping their own gas or shopping at Wal-Mart.  Paris goes so far when Wal-Mart is mentioned in dinnertime conversation to say ""What is Wal-Mart? Do they sell, like, wall stuff?""  It's hard for me to believe that even the wealthiest of the wealthy don't know what Wal-Mart is.  Then again, the poorest of the poor don't know what Channel is either, even though both labels are famous.

It was kind of fun, kind of rude - but then again that's what Paris and Nicole are all about to begin with.",1231027200,,1309,4.512711864406779

Of course, it's always going to depend on your sense of humor, so I can understand why some people don't care for it too much. It is sad, as other reviewers pointed out how much infleuence they have over teenager's lives nowadays, and I think this show proves that these girls definately aren't good role models, but I still love the show and laugh at every episode. I like it because it's a different kind of funny than most of the stuff that's coming out today. Frankly, I'm getting sick of all the potty humor, like Carmen Electra taking a dump in front of everyone in Scary Movie 4. It's interesting to see how much these girls can get away with, because you know that if it were anyone else, they wouldn't get away with half the things that they do, even though the the things they get away with are mean and, to quote another reviewer, petty. And it has you wondering time and time again, ""What are these girls thinking?! Do they have an ounce of common sense?"" and ""It's amazing how stupid people can be!"" but all in all, I love the show, and wondering ""What the h*ll are they thinking!!!!???"" is half the fun!",1160006400,2,1262,4.374468085106383

despite the obvious differences with their host family, i thought they got along as well as you could expect. and they weren't disrespectful - except about going out at night! and come one, they're 21 and 22 yr olds, adults.

after watching this and the 3rd season, i think paris and nicole have gotten a bad rap. they're just two girls who want to have fun. and that's what they do in this series.",1155254400,4,952,4.372881355932203
1969603,3,B00013RC34,"I've been watching the fourth season of this and recently rented the first season just out of curiosity.

Watching any part of any season of this show is largely a waste of time; however, I think this program is a popular culture monument. I'm not saying it's good, or it's bad, but it does make quite a statement about the miserably wealthy and the purely modest and how they fail to interface in any acceptable way.

The girls are up to the same antics nowadays as they were four years ago but I notice two significant changes in their characters. Nicole has slimmed down substantially and although she's foul-mouthed and irreverent as always, she's very sharp and witty these days. She's impudently cruel as well, but altogether quick with a quip. The Paris character, on the other hand, has only changed by becoming more irresponsible, helpless and useless. In addition, she's raised the pitch of her voice by about five or six musical steps so that now she sounds like a 9-year-old.

Plenty of the documentary-style entertainment value of this vehicle is staged, and I even imagine that someone has the job to make up stuff that would make for a lousy experience for someone but good TV for the rest of us; still, I think Paris should behave more like an heiress and less like a child. The effect would be the same, of course, but the performance would be more believable.

I'll give it a 3 because I am completely neutral about it. Whether you like this show or hate this show, I would understand. Give it a look.",1154217600,,1519,4.594095940959409

This is like ""Jackass"" for women or a ""Three Stooges"" (minus one) for the millenium.  Nicole and Paris have great chemistry together! They are like a modern ""Laurel and Hardy"". Alright that is enough analogies. I loved season 2&3 as well. Worth the rental fees at your local video store when looking for an evening of mindless entertainment.

The completely immature stunts that the Hilton girl pulled ammazed me and made this TV show the most unwatchable experiance since the Andy Dick Show.

Nicole Ritchie attempts to do most of the supposed jobs and seemed outgoing but Paris was a bore. Awful show and I'm glad Nicole is done with this whore. Because Paris is rich and a majority of people find her attracted she is all over the place.

Both of these sex/clothes/excitement obsessed ditzes come across as the worst argument for continuing our consumer culture that could be offered. Their lives are pointless; their mere existence seems like an accident that should have been avoided.

This crap is an embarrassment to America! Who are their fans? Rebellious teens? Nothing these two did in this awful escapade was worthy of watching. Stealing, lying, picking on teen girls and taking their boyfriends? Dressing like hookers, acting unbelievably snobbish and stupid, and laughing at their hosts?

Today in this day of age, stars lose endorsement deals just for speaking their mind about politics, Janet Jackson has had to apologize and may even have to pay a fine for the accident that happen on live television.

See what happens when the girls with everything go from filthy rich...to just plain filthy!""  The Simple Life was obviously not the ""ultimate culture clash,"" it would have been more `ultimately' sensational for Paris and Nicole to be allocated to a rural Iraqi town. The program was produced, marketed, and consumed as a sitcom, however still had the scandalous and voyeuristic qualities of reality television.  It should, however, be described not as reality television, but as `postmodern soap-umentary'.

The Simple Life presented gender and class stereotypically.  It presented females as either both economically and sexually powerful or as jealous and motherly `frumps', and males as either sexually passive, or as fatherly and controlling.  The program was incidental in creating a media representation for both Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, and aided the increase in their celebrity.

But was The Simple Life really simple?  Or was the program just an opportunity for Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie to gallop around the country with gay abandon?  And how much were they paid?  The Simple Life was popular not only in America, but around the world.  The public was fascinated by the personalities and lives of the rich and famous and how they differed from their own.  The program was also popular because it used stereotypes to entertain audiences within a genre with which they are familiar.  It was because of these stereotypes that it was so successful.  Although it was not reality, it was still a success, just as Green Acres was before it.  In being profitable, it created millions of advertising dollars for the Fox Network.

Even the littlest Leding, no more than three, realizes how much better life is without Paris and Nicole hounding him. It is sad to think of what America has come to by making such trash a hit. Horrid reality shows like this one stay on the air, but worthwhile series like WONDERFALLS aren't even given a chance to succeed. It is pathetic. No wonder Michael Moore has so much to make fun of.

The show is funny but who ever made this DVD must have been High on something. The reason why I say that is because after ever cut in the show it keeps showing the credits over and over and over and did I mention over and over again, The DVD has not even been organized, the person that did it just did cut and slapped on. The DVD is exactly like the FOX show but its even harder to follow it on DVD everything is unorganized and it keeps showing the start of the show over and over after every cut. This is by far the worst DVD made, A 15 year old kid could have done a better job then the bimbo that did this DVD. It is a total waste of money. Your better off just recording the shows at home and making your own DVD. Also when I bought the DVD I was expecting to see some skin or even some bad language but NO there's noting everything is BLEEPED out and BLURRED out, this DVD is horrible. I wouldn't even give it 1 STAR if they made the DVD better I would give it a 4 STAR, The show is great but the DVD makes it stupid. If you ever have the chance try to rent it before buying it and u'll see what I mean and everybody that bought I feel sorry for them spending there money on something that's not even complete. I hope Simple Life 2 DVD is not this boring and I hope they show some skin and not censor Paris and Nicole body and bad language.",1089158400,7,1503,3.8360128617363345

No credit cards,boo hoo,they really must have it bad in their lives,(yeah right).Paris & Nicki are known for showing off,partying,showing skin,& the rest we know..This was pathetic,watching these 2 rich brats try & work at a burger shop,and they couldn't even do that or any of the jobs they were given,(sad).All the girls wanted to do was go out with boys,party and really act the way they do at home,(ever since 2 of age,they sit on their butts,having everyone do everything for them). They broke up guys relationships with their girlfriends,(if you watch the part where Paris tells this girl,""He don't want you anymore"",& to see her face,how it hurt,& all they did was laugh at all the MEAN things they did to ANOTHER HUMAN BEING,(put the shoe on the other foot girls).Telling lies to Guys,saying they would Model,etc...And watching this,I don't believe for one moment they were acting,this is how they really are. Need to grow it up & watch out Girls,someday you may actualy have to WORK for a living. When youve been raised not to care about hurting other peoples feelings,their town,and fake appologies,we'll what do we expect when our youth are watching this and saying its ok to act like this & get away with it cause you have $$$,would we?? This is a mean-spirited couple of Girls who buy their way out of everything,(in the real life,people WORK for a living).Even the ending,where Nicki lose's her purse & goes nuts,threatning people,throwing clorox on the pool table,and acting like a BABY,finally the truth was heard,""Go HOME RICH WITCHE'S"",it rhymes with witch,that was the best of the whole show!!!

1). Paris and Nicole were most likely told by the FOX execs to be as outrageous as possible. Was it staged? Who knows, but it's certain that their behavior was egged on by FOX. Would 20 million people have watched it if they were behaving, going to work on time, and doing a good job? No!
2). FOX most likely covered all the damage that was done, including compensating the milk man. Somebody had to pay for the stuff they did, so aside from minor aggrevation, there was probably no harm done.
That being said I found this show entertaining and I was quite impressed with Paris and Nicole. Before the show, I thought Paris was probably the biggest spoiled brat ever. Now, my perception of her has changed. Her and Nicole seem like decent people, who are not full of themselves. Not once did Paris or Nicole ridicule their Arkansas friends, make fun of their way of life, or make them feel inferior. They seemed to appreciate the values of these people and see the beauty of a place that frankly I would have a hard time seeing. It's made me look at things differently, believe or not. They made relationships with these people and seem to genuinely care about them. All in all, they seem like really nice girls, who haven't allowed their priviledges to make them nasty people! It just goes to show how wrong our perceptions can be.
I don't think Paris and Nicole failed, because I don't think they really tried, other than to make relationships with people. If anything, they were exploited by FOX! Again, who would have watched the show if it wasn't so outrageous? And outrageous it was...it provided lots of laughs and it was pure fun.
From the Reunion Show it seems that maybe Paris and Nicole may be a permanent fixture in the lives of some of the people they met, especially the familty. At least I hope so. It would be a shame if they lost contact, and it was so obvious from the tears shed during the last episode that all parties involved grew to care about each other, and what is more beautiful than that?

Paris and Nicole are not stupid, they're sheltered-what people see as stupidity is simply innocent ignorance. The girls' discoveries on the farm are laugh out loud funny.

Firstly i think the reason some people r dissin this show and these girls is because they r jelous of what Paris and Nicole have. I mean Paris ans Nicole are rich, hot and famous and people who diss em are simply just...well...unfortunate-looking and poor :-)
I watch the first few eps of this show at a m8s house and from then on a was a devoted fan of the show and the girls and im totally looking forward to the next season!
I love love love the quotes and convos, like ""Do u guys hang out at wall mart?....Coz they like sell Wall stuff?"", ""Theres a well...Is it a real well...What r wells for"", ""Im not plucking anything...eccept my eyebrows"", ""Move out of the f@*!ing way!!! MOVE! Get yur fat a*@es down there!!!! like that?"" ect ect ect there are thousands :-)
The fashion aspect of this shows intregued me as well (Dior, DKNY, Chanel ect) I loved watching Paris try on her whole wardrobe lol (that yellow and pink farm mini dress was so cute)

I couldn't agree more with the reviewer from Hanover, PA: Be ashamed that this country not only produces twits such as Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie but that FOX celebrates their dippiness by putting them on national television.
Paris and Nicole proved that they wouldn't be able to work an honest day's work if their pampered lives depended on it.  It's truly pathetic when shallow individuals such as these two are handed a television show based on their names just to give them something to do besides ""modeling,"" shopping, partying and drinking.  Too bad people with good ideas are pushed aside to make room for this junk.
The Hilton family must have been cringing as they watched this (if they even bothered to).  I've read many accounts that the Hilton family is VERY embarassed of Rick Hilton and how his branch of the family have soiled the Hilton name.  (Can you blame them?)
There's no point in suggesting that these two use their wealth for humanitarian purposes.  Chances are they wouldn't know the meaning of the word (if it doesn't include the words ""Dior,"" ""Gucci,"" or ""Saks Fifth Avenue,"" these two are completely lost).
Now the public will soon be ""blessed"" to have these two airheads gracing our airwaves again in ""The Simple Life 2.""  The good Republicans at FOX (always screaming about the dumbing down of American values) will, once again, bring quality, family programming into American living rooms with a second dose of stupidity.
As for the reviewer who suggested that negative reviews are from ""bitter"" people: What's to be ""bitter, jealous or envious about?  We know what it's like to work a hard day's work, we can support ourselves without the help of mommy's and daddy's credit cards and we can make a dollar stretch.

1969724,3,B00013RC34,"What made this series so interesting is the clash of ideals concerning ""upper class"" in America and ""lower and working classes"" in America.  While ""class"" refers to a group sharing the same economic or social status, it also refers to something of high quality or elegance (Merriam-Webster).  We tend to think of the ""upper class"" as being well-mannered and refined.  This series plays with that notion.  While Hilton and Ritchie clearly share upper class status, it was the people of the town of Altus (who did not fall into the category of the ""upper class"") who displayed more ""class"" according to the typical definition and were made to feel uncomfortable by the lack of manners displayed by Hilton and Ritchie.
In addition, the film also has interesting implications for what we view as crime.  Hilton and Ritchie put items on a charge account without the owner of the account's permission.  They later lie about several things to avoid either giving up the items or dealing with the consequences.  They make comments such as, ""What is the big deal?  It was only x amount of dollars"" and ""It wasn't stealing.  It was charging.""  Imagine if a poor person of color did the equivalent type of crime!

But believe it or not for the first time I laughed with this kind of shows (with ""The simple life""), with stupid things actually but I could laugh.
The story here is that Paris and Nicole Richie go to a small town without credit cards, money or selfphones. So this means that they have to work and they are out of control and they make the family with who they are living totally crazy.

1969728,3,B00013RC34,"The 'It Girls' phenomena has been all over the UK tabloids few years back, referring to young women who have had the good fortune of being born into huge wealth, and who just happen to be very beautiful, spoiled and famous for doing absolutely nothing at all !(like Tara Parker-Tomlinson,or Lady Victoria Harvey).
These young women have never done any serious/or no job in their lives, and spend their days shooting covers for men's fashion magazines, shopping or skiing ,and their nights being snapped half naked and totally drunk, at the arms of some footballer or movie star.
This phenomena has reached US shores, belatedly but with force with the Hilton sisters, the heiresses to the Hilton Hotel empire, the adventures or shall I shall say the misadventures of whom have occupied many a headline recently and their sexy figures have graced many covers.
So Fox has come up with this smart idea of putting these girls to the ultimate test of endurance and suffering, and proving to the world at large, or whoever is interested that they are far from the dumb and spoiled rotten image that is firmly stuck to them. This momentous task would be achieved by living with a farming working class family in Arkansas for one whole month and doing some actual work..Very hard indeed!
In comes Paris Hilton, along with her best friend  Nicole Richie, Lionel Richie's adopted daughter,(after Paris's sister Nikki declined to come along), ready to embark on the adventure of their lives and tackle head on the Simple Life:
I can not seem to form one straight opinion about this documentary/DVD.
On one hand, it is good TV: it is in a way original (besides how much can a viewer take watching endless celebs saving animals,their TV spot of choice)..
It is funny at times, and after the third episode,the girls kind of grow on you. Nicole certainly fare much better than Paris as she has a kind of sweet and innocent charm, and certainly more Grey cells than her best friend.
You will also definitely be shocked at the total ignorance of our lovely jet setters about normal life!
Paris has never heard of Wall Mart, and thinks it is a place that sells ...'Wall Stuff'..This must sound too dumb for words, but upon reflection it is also the result of highly sheltered and pampered life!! This reminded me of Marie Antoinette saying to her starving people 'Let them eat cake'. Of course the French queen never said that and it was all a revolutionary propaganda to agitate the mobs against royalty, however Paris Hilton surely did say what she did about Wall Mart!
Yet I felt that the whole series was very pretentious, and the performances far from  real. You can feel that the girls were acting/playing  for the cameras, and it was at times way over the top.
In addition to that, you might find the girls sexy, funny and you might spend a good time following their mischief, but one thing you will never feel for them is sympathy! I mean it is like a big game to them, a novelty that they know will soon finish, and they will soon go back to the life they can not come out from..
So I have to say that although I did enjoy watching Simple Life, my heart did not bleed for them, nor I found some of the troubles they caused their employers or the empty promises they gave to the boys of the town particularly funny.
Andy Warhol famously said,'In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes'

Sure she lacks a bit in the breast department, but those eyes have it all. Great legs too. The other chick (Lionel Richie's daughter) is kind of dumb, no I wouldn't kick her out of the bed for eating crackers, but compared to Paris, she's nothing special.
Watch as these girls as they vaganally assault cows, serve burgers, and pick up boys by making them kiss each other. I may not be a farmer, but I'd mow Paris' lawn.

The reason 4 stars instead of 5 is i feel the dvd was rushed. DvD was released 1 week to the day of when the last episode aired. I wished they would've held it back longer so they could have added more extras on the dvd. The extras are good but there should've been more. Its missing the ""lost episode"" and the ""reunion"" show that aired on tv just days after the dvd was released. Should had held back awhile so that it could've been added to the extras. And the dvd is one of those 2 sided clear dvds that is such a pain to take care of. Coz hard to get those dvds out of the case without getting fingerprints on them coz both sides are clear and player sides. But don't get me wrong it is still worth it to buy this dvd. What i just mentioned are the only things that are the downsides of this dvd. And at this price can't go wrong. For my money Nicole Richie *not Paris* is the sexiest and most funniest of the two. Watch for Nicole's FAKE crying in episode 5. It is one of the hardest i laughed in a long time. Which Nicole later on a interview joked that was her ""oscar worthy performance*.Yeah Right. But that is made that scene sooooo funny was the really bad acting. At times watching this you want to hang out with them hug them kiss them mostly Nicole. And at times you want to jump in the screen and get some common sense into them. They say that they went back home to the city of angels with lessons learned. Lets hope so. But all made for good TV.I for sure Highly recommend that you purchase at amazon.com If you seen it on tv relive the fun that is the simple life. If you never seen it purchase this dvd & discover the fun that you missed when it was on tv. And i can't end this off by saying the picture *mostly Nicole Richie in the overalls* is also worth it.

They are spoiled, 'open' and ditsy blond girls, even they've said so and the show did nothing to try to defend them but they didn't seem to care. Why? Because the show is -meant- to be amusing and fun. Even as a grown woman I was amused by it, I find more disgust and raw stupidity in the show Fear Factor personally.
The DVD itself was somewhat of poor quality, the no music in the main selection screen seems like it was a mistake and it looks bad on them that they overlooked it. Since there was music on every other screen.

But where most of my co-workers saw hilarity, I saw a pair of despicable, pathetic, spoiled bimbettes with little or no values and barely a brain to split between them. That their host family didn't take Nicole and Paris out to the woodshed for a sound whupping amazes me, because they wouldn't have lasted 30 minutes with a heartland family had the cameras not been trained on them.
Yet the enormity of the hype that these two worthless show-biz kids managed to whip up around themselves gives one pause. They managed to denigrate anything that their hosts tried to offer them, couldn't as much as hold a job for more than a day without either throwing a tantrum or stealing from the employer, and basically disobeyed any kind of disciplines that were requested of them. All they seemed to be capable of doing was giggle, show cleavage, curse like sailors and behave like remorseless bubble-heads, barely capable of sheathing their contempt till they could escape the farm and get back to their bank accounts. Do these two irresponsible twits have parents that care if their daughters provide incontrovertible evidence of their absolute failures as an upbringer of their children?

While this may seem an amusing premise in reality its about as interesting as watching paint dry on the side of a barn. My constant thought as I watched the show was ""If this is the future of America, we're in deep trouble.""
Ritchie and Hilton manage to make fun of all things not L.A or New York and come across as spoiled brats who simply must get their way no matter what.

1969758,4,B00013RC34,"I am not going to argue that this is the end of the world as we know it, but just that ""The Simple Life"" represents the bottom of the barrel for me as a critic of popular culture.  Not so much the show as Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, a couple of heiresses who will never have enough money to ever be able to buy a clue as to what wretched human beings they are.  Even then, more so at the start of the show, when they were more famous for being famous than now, when they have at least accomplished sticking their arms into the wrong end of a cow.  Too bad Andy Warhol is dead because given how low the celebrity bar has gone down to admit this pair to stardom he would have to revise his postulate regarding 15 of fame.

The idea here, as sold by FOX TV was ""From filthy rich to just plain filthy,"" a variation on ""Green Acres"" if you took Eva Gabor, split her in half, which would cut her age in half and divide her brain between them (at least Eva Gabor was intentionally funny).  So Paris and Nicole are sent to live on the Leding farm in Altus, Arkansas for 30 days, where three generations of Ledings have to put up with behavior that would have to be improved greatly just to be deemed adolescent.  ""The Simple Life"" is truly remarkable as the only reality show that I have ever seen in which you have a pair of participants who were complete unaffected by the entire experience.  Is the idea that there is no such thing as bad publicity a product of heredity or environment?  Is there ANYTHING in this world that would embarrass Nicole Richie?

I have to pick Paris as the better of the two by default, not just because she tended to keep her mouth shut more while Nicole went on one of her fake crying jags, but because something buried deep inside her told her that it would be wrong to take back somebody's birthday gift because you bought it by charging it to somebody else's account.  I suppose television could come up with two more worthless human beings to parade before the camera and I know there is no way of stopping them in such a quest, but it is not exactly a revival of the Golden Age of television (think of something more organic as the adjective).  Paris and Nicole are like the ""National Inquirer,"" where you cannot really lampoon them because anything you come up with, no matter how obnoxious or offensive, is something they would actually do.

This DVD was pretty much out in record time and includes all seven episodes of the ""series.""  Yes, they are still censored, which is a shame simply because Paris and Nicole could still be degraded by actually hearing every foul word that comes out of their mouths.  The show is so compelling in the same way as a car accident (one of those where the person who causes it walks away while everybody else is in a body bag).  Hopefully there are indeed plans for a sequel to ""The Simple Life,"" because no matter where they send these two airheads the next time the locals will be loaded for bear and although I know that Paris and Nicole will never get any joke at their expense, the viewers will and that will make all the difference the next tiime this 21st-century freak show goes on the road.

Final Thought:  I assume that since these two want all the money they can get their hands on that they will never have children, because that would mean spending money (and time) on somebody else.  Is this a good thing because someday their children will see this video and Paris and Nicole might sober up long enough to realize this might not have been the smartest thing they ever did or a bad thing because it denies them the chance to find out what it is like for your children to embarrass you on national television (""The Simple Life: The Next Generation"").  Then again, all that time on the farm might have taught them something and they will not have children, they will just clone themselves.

You know, it is almost too easy to make fun of these two...",1074988800,35,3935,4.357045143638851

Taking two rich, spoiled blondes out of their natural, Los Angeles habitat and putting them on a farm with no cell phones, no credit cards and watching them as they struggle to hold down a normal, everyday job is hilarious. As soon as Paris and Nicole come on screen, their charm quickly ignites the small town and us viewers. You can't wait to see what adventures unfold for these beautiful, bubbly ladies. From farming to fast food jobs to curfews and country living, Paris and Nicole's worlds are turned upside down as is the family's that lets them in. While Paris and Nicole try hard to live the simple life, they always find a way to put their spin on things and it will keep you in stitches.

When I finally had the time to view the tape, OH MY GOSH!! I was laughing so hard I had tears coming out of my eyes!!
It's one or one of the of the funniest shows I have EVER seen! You will not stop laughing! Even when these girls are serious you just can't stop laughing at their comments.
I got this DVD today, in its release day, and I just have a question; is it my DVD or there isn't any kind of audio at the beginning? (The MENU)
And to answer someone else's question earlier on, I was a bit disappointed that Fox kept the original censored parts on the DVD just as in the show that aired. The ""Sonic"" scenes would have been much funnier if Nicole and Paris' gloves weren't censored! I would have expected that for a selling DVD for private home use would not be edited.

This Seven Episode series was full of hilarious scenarios and outragous humor such as When Paris thought Wall-Mart was a store for walls, or when Nicole and Paris started the kissing booth, and the two of them had no underwear on. It was also funny to see that the family had never heard of the Paris Hilton video or when Nicole and Paris saw the only bathroom. There are soo many more that if I tell you my review will exceed the limit.

However, as many mistakes as they made, by the final episode, I think they actually grew to love their ""new family"" and cared about them.  The reunion show was the best; I thought their surprise for the family showed that they really cared about them.  The show was hilarious, and I often wondered if the show was staged at times, but, regardless, it was very entertaining.",1074384000,,509,4.633333333333334
1969779,4,B00013RC34,"I watched ""The Simple Life"" periodically on FOX during the few months it came on. It's funny in your-so-stupid kind of way. I can't believe Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie act like this. They're real life sitcom stars!
The boy crazy rich and bratty 20-something girls move from posh and pampered Los Angeles to a small town farm in Arkansas with a family for a month. Thence they pluck chickens, milk cows and cause havoc on the quiet and unsuspecting town. Both girls struggle to fit in accordingly with the family. They get ordinary jobs but fail miserably at them. They have no moral integrity! But that's the beauty in this show!
Paris and Nicole sometimes don't realize how brainless they are. But at the same time they mock fun of themselves and know how silly they are to people. I take that back, they're not brainless! It's just reality television! I won't get the DVD  though, just watch the show on FOX.",1074124800,,914,4.607361963190184
1969780,4,B00013RC34,"After reading some reviews, I feel people haven't clued in about a couple of big factors!
1). Paris and Nicole were most likely told by the FOX execs to be as outrageous as possible.  Was it staged?  Who knows, but it's certain that their behavior was egged on by FOX.  Would 20 million people have watched it if they were behaving, going to work on time, and doing a good job?  No!
2). FOX most likely covered all the damage that was done, including compensating the milk man.  Somebody had to pay for the stuff they did, so aside from minor aggrevation, there was probably no harm done.
That being said I found this show entertaining and I was quite impressed with Paris and Nicole.  Before the show, I thought Paris was probably the biggest spoiled brat ever.  Now, my perception of her has changed.  Her and Nicole seem like decent people, who are not full of themselves.  Not once did Paris or Nicole ridicule their Arkansas friends, make fun of their way of life, or make them feel inferior.  They seemed to appreciate the values of these people and see the beauty of a place that frankly I would have a hard time seeing.  It's made me look at things differently, believe or not.  They made relationships with these people and seem to genuinely care about them.  All in all, they seem like really nice girls, who haven't allowed their priviledges to make them nasty people!  It just goes to show how wrong our perceptions can be.
I don't think Paris and Nicole failed, because I don't think they really tried, other than to make relationships with people.  If anything, they were exploited by FOX!  Again, who would have watched the show if it wasn't so outrageous?  And outrageous it was...it provided lots of laughs and it was pure fun.
From the Reunion Show it seems that maybe Paris and Nicole may be a permanent fixture in the lives of some of the people they met, especially the familty.  At least I hope so.  It would be a shame if they lost contact, and it was so obvious from the tears shed during the last episode that all parties involved grew to care about each other, and what is more beautiful than that?",1074124800,9,2124,4.484375
1969781,5,B00013RC34,"Let me just say one thing first, for all the people saying all the bad things about these two girls, these girls are far smarter than most of the average Americans out there, and you just want to think rich hot chicks are stupid and spoiled so you could sleep better tonight.  Watch the show closely, These girls know how to take advantage of anyone in any stituation with their given strength(wealth, beauty...).  They fully understand the importance of working smart, not working hard.  They have a great understanding of human nature and they won't be fooled by surface kindness of the others, and it seems like they really could see through anyone's mind.  They are already great politicians at these young age, once they grew up and settled down, they will be very successful.  Bare in mind that a lot of important characters nowaday such as George W Bush were spoiled barts in their younger days too. They have much richer life experiences than us average joes that they could grow to be great leaders one day.  Just remember while we are sitting at our stupid homes watching all these stupid reality TV series, they are having all the great time and adsorbing all these important life experiences to rule us in the future, life sucks.  However, good thing about America is if we work hard and we are talented, we could one day be just like them.  Also, people might think their conversions are stupid.  Please, we all talk and act stupid around our friends, this is human nature. And yes, I am a Paris addict, I think she is the most beautiful girl in the history of human being, I think she is 10 times more beautiful than Grace Kelly, which is second on my list.  We all have sex, just because we have seen her having sex doesn't make us any cleaner than her.

The milk they destroyed never got sent out, they repaired the pool table, and all the stuff they charged was eventually paid for.

I thought the first episode was very funny as the girls left their cushy life and were introduced to an Arkansas farm family.  Unfortunately, the series took a quick and cruel turn in the second episode.  The girls' first job was at a dairy and they were to fill bottles with milk.  That they made a mess of it wasn't surprising.  That they were so indifferent about the fact that someone would be drinking the ""milk"" that they had poured water into and that the spilt milk was a loss to the poor farmer who depends on milk sales for his living was quite mean spirited.  No life lessons learned here.
Maybe the joke is on us.  Reality shows aren't always as unscripted as we are led to believe.  Perhaps the farmer and others in the community were warned that the girls were going to be as unmanageable as possible because it was ""good TV.""

In a continuous fit of irresponsibility, the series shows the females breaking curfew, showing up late to work, and getting fired from more than one job.  In their unladylike personalities, the females regularly insult their hosts, both directly to their faces and behind their backs.  In an ultimate crime of nonhumor, Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie actually debate about stealing, then choose to steal regardless of its consequences, and when confronted by the owner of the credit card they criminally used, they laughed behind his back for their deceit.
