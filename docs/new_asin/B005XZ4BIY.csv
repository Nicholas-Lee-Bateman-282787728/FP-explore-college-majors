Things we would never do as modern divers; dynamiting a reef ! carelessly killing a baby whale, and then killing the sharks for feeding on the carcass ! I could barely believe I had put him on a pedestal for all these years. Jaques' stock really went down after watching these. now, I hadn't seen them since a child, and I am grateful for all his sharing explorations. Thank goodness we (divers) treat the ocean much better now.",1358812800,,457,4.4523809523809526

1. They depict incredible wildlife and nature scenes in 'HD' (digitally remastered film at superb blu-ray quality, but note the 4:3 aspect ratio so I'm not sure if it's true 1080p). Much of what is shown had never been filmed before when these were released, and some never has been again due to the risks these guys were willing to take. These documentaries of expeditions to truly wild places have often been imitated, but never bested in my opinion.

2. They depict in stark reality how the world has changed. Nowadays its wooden men in iron boats - held back by liability issues, money, egos, lack of teamsmanship, whatever. Back then it was iron men in wooden boats (the Calypso was originally a minesweeper and built entirely of wood). These guys were legends. Who else but Cousteau's crew would spend their time singing nationalistic songs together while enduring a lengthy, hot, claustrophobic decompression session in a tiny steel chamber strung under a ship in the middle of the ocean? Divers to fix a broken propeller shaft under the ship at sea while in the freezing Antarctic while icebergs float by? no problem!

Some of this stuff has to be seen to be believed.

These movies were a hit when they were released, and should be a hit with any viewer who is too young to have seen them the first time.",1356393600,4,1356,4.684873949579832

The Undersea World series has already been released in Europe, but not here in the USA. WHY is that? If they can make this region free, why cant they make The Underwater World series region free?",1322784000,5,302,4.716981132075472
