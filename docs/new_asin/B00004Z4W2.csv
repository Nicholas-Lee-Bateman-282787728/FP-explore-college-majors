1380018,3,B00004Z4W2,"I`m a big fan of Bava`s horror films (not of Lisa and the Devil and House of Exorcism) and thrillers and they look really beautiful on DVD but it would have been a great improvement, if the films would have been put together genrewise and not having to see such stinkers like Roy Colt or from Vol. 1 Knives of the Avenger which where boring me out of my mind. So next time you`re in to bring out a box about a master director concentrate on the good stuff and leave the waste behind.",1237334400,3,483,4.148936170212766
1380019,5,B00004Z4W2,"I believe that it's hard to be a true horror fan unless you're familiar with the history of the genre.  It's not enough to merely catch the latest slasher or torture porn movie (whether good or bad) and revel in the blood and shock; to enjoy these movies on a deeper level requires knowing the older movies too.  Yes, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi may not truly scare the modern fan, but their films established much of the ideas that would follow.

In addition, it is necessary to go beyond the borders of the United States.  While Japan seems to draw most of the attention nowadays, Italy also has a wonderful history when it comes to horror, and perhaps no Italian director did more for Italian horror than Mario Bava.  The Mario Bava Collection Volume 2 collects eight of his movies, not all of which are horror.

In order of my viewing, my first movie watched was Roy Colt and Winchester Jack, which is kind of a Spaghetti Western with marinara sauce: somewhat tasty but with no meat to it.  A take-off on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the movie follows the two title characters as they work both together and separately to find a hidden gold treasure (which also evokes The Good, The Bad and the Ugly).

Next was Four Times That Night, Bava's attempt at a sex comedy, in which various characters related, in Rashomon-like fashion, the misadventures of a date.  Did she seduce him, did he try to rape her or was something else going on?  It's a rather lightweight movie, but also looks nice.  After these two films, we get more into Bava's forte:  horror and crime.

5 Dolls for an August Moon is reminiscent of And Then There Were None, with its plot of characters trapped on an island where they're being killed one by one.  It's a stylish example of giallo, an Italian form of mystery stories.

Lisa and the Devil is a true horror story, with Elke Sommer as a tourist in Spain who gets trapped in a surrealistic world and goes to a house with a history of dark secrets and a butler played by Telly Savalas who's really the Devil.  As good as this movie is, it actually was never released in Bava's lifetime.  Instead, it was recut as House of Exorcism, awkwardly incorporating elements of the original movie with an Exorcist-like plot.  This version includes Robert Alda (Alan's father) as the priest out to stop a possession.

Bay of Blood is non-supernatural horror and an influence on slasher films like Friday the 13th.  Various characters converge at an isolated bay which is possibly targeted for development as a resort.  The killings are done creatively and viciously, leading to a conclusion that is both unexpected and rather fitting.

Baron Blood is one of those tales of a character who decides to try out an old spell just to see what happens.  What happens is exactly what is promised by the incantation:  the resurrection of a notorious Baron who had a real flair for torturing.  This movie also has Elke Sommer as well as Joseph Cotton.

Finally, there is Bava's penultimate film, a crime movie called Rabid Dogs.  The story here focuses on four thieves who commit a payroll robbery.  One dies in a shootout that also disables their car, leading them to a carjacking to get out of town with three hostages including a small, sick child.  Most of the story takes place in the car, and this is another film that ends with a nice little plot twist.  Similar to Lisa and the Devil, Rabid Dogs also has an inferior version called Kidnapped.

With the exception of Roy Colt (and maybe House of Exorcism), these are all good to great movies, showing why Bava has his loyal fans.  In addition to the films, we get commentaries on five of the films (all but the first three above), four by Bava scholar Tim Lucas, the other on House of Exorcism by Elke Sommer and producer Alfred Leone.  Between this boxed set and the first one, we get much of Bava's work, but there is room for at least one more set, with such horror movies as Hatchet for the Honeymoon, Blood and Black Lace and The Whip and the Body as well as films like Danger: Diabolik, Planet of Vampires and Hercules in the Underworld.  That's why Lucas's last comment on Rabid Dogs is welcome:  ""More commentaries to come""  After watching both these sets, that is good news indeed!",1232841600,3,4262,4.569169960474309
1380020,4,B00004Z4W2,"Basically, with this set you get 3 essential Bava movies: Bay of Blood, Kidnapped, & Lisa and The Devil. 2 good ones : Baron Blood & 5 Dolls for an August Moon.  2 average ones: Four Times That Night & Roy Colt and Winchest Jack. And 1 failure: House of Exorcism.

Bay of Blood is probably the most essential out of all the films here.  It is quite possibly the very first slasher film about a group of greedy relatives and associates all killing each other in pretty gruesome ways to get their hands on a piece of property(and not a very good one at that) that the family patriarch leaves behind after she is murdered.  Bava is in great form here at employing black humor, camera tricks, & quite a few gruesome effects(the machette to the face effect looks so real).

5 Dolls For An August moon is pretty much the same story except this time it a scientific fomula that's at stake not a piece of land and the murders are not all that grusome.  Also, as far a ""feel"" of the film is concerned they are polar opposite: ""5 Dolls"" is lush and beautiful while ""Bay"" is harsh and crude.  You still get the black humor and some amazing camera work.  The scene with the men are struggling and knock over a set of glass balls which roll off into a jacuzi where the last victim makes the film worth viewing alone.

Lisa and the Devil is Bava's movie that he himself always wanted to make.  A girl gets lost while traveling Europe and winds up at a spooky villa with several other charaters who start dying.  This is Bava's at his artsy best, it is confusing, it feels like a dream, and is the most beautiful movie Bava ever made.  His ""Alice in Wonderland"".

Kidnapped is Bava's harsh view of reality. After robbing a bank a bunch of thieves find some hostages, steal their car, and plan a route of escape.  Nihilistic, harsh, and mean would best descibe this one. The polar opposite of ""Lisa"".  This is his ""Last House On The Left"" and he does a good job at it.

Baron Blood is one most Bava fans love but I really only thought was pretty good.  A distant decendant of a cruel Baron inherits his castle, tries to make it a tourist attraction, and inadvertantly ressurects the Baron who goes back to his muderous old ways.  There's a great theme here about old terror in a modernized world but it is never really built upon.  It does have some nice photography & Joseph Cotton turns in a good performance but me, myself thought that it was better than averave.

Four times that night is Bava's attempt at a sex comedy.  Its basically four perspectives on a possible one night stand.  Campy & colorful but its just too bad that it is only sometimes funny.  Still worth it if you like Bava's style. Its actually like ""5 Dolls"" only without the murders.

Roy Colt and Wincester Jack is Bava's failed attempt at a Spagetti Western.  5 outlaws are all on the hunt for gold from a treasure map.  The story is interesting and there are some good moments but I found most of it a just ok.  Average.

House of Exorcism is basically a re-cut, re-edited Lisa and the Devil with new fottage put in to cash in on the popularity of The Exorcist. Its watchable, but not memorable at all.

All in all, a fine collection even if there are some films that are better and could of been subsituted.  Hatchet for the Honeymoon, Planet of the Vampires, Caltiki, the Immortal Monster, Danger: Diabolic, or Shock are good ones and could of been used instead of House of Exorcism, Four Times That Night, or Roy Colt. But hey, there might be a Volume 3, right.",1229817600,3,3524,4.376923076923077
1380021,5,B00004Z4W2,"I recently bought Bava Box Set, Vol. 2 and ""Bay of Blood"" was the first movie I watched because I had heard that it launched the slasher genre.  It definely lived up to its reputation and made this collection worth buying.  I was apprehensive about watching it after reading numerous complaints about the audio quality on the Image release, but I heard every word plainly!  The plot was more complex than I had imagined.  I had to watch it carefully to understand who was killing who and why.  It contained numerous shocks and twists.  It was definitely a cross between an Italian giallo and a slasher movie.
  I watched many scenes that were indeed duplicated throughout the slasher frenzy of the late seventies and early eighties, especially in the Friday 13th movies.  Bay of Blood is a prime example of Mario Bava's influence on other directors.
  The bizarre ending was similar to the one in Mario Bava's ""Rabid Dogs,"" another controversial, provocative thriller with a high body count.",1194048000,16,991,4.839285714285714
1380022,4,B00004Z4W2,"Having just picked this up, I thought I'd chime in with this second box set from Anchor Bay. While the comparison will seem strange, Like Orson Welles, and this is speaking from public perception, Mario Bava's debut film, 'Black Sunday', was so impressive that many of his subsequent releases were dismissed as sub par or viewed as schlock. Of course, many of these critics overlooked the consistent artistry that could be found throughout Bava's filmography.

While Volume 1 focused on a number of his most iconic and famous films from the early to mid sixties, Volume 2 focus' on his late 60s til mid 70s output, to good effect I might add. His film, 'Four Times That Night' (1968), is a sex comedy with a Rashomon flavored theme. A mild mannered man, and a seemingly virtuous woman have a date, which leads to the kind of mishap that triggers three wildly different perspectives, from the man, woman and a spectator. It's very much a film of the late sixties, fun, good film, but not great. A fair share of nudity and sexual content, which makes it not accessible for minors, fair warning.

'5 Dolls For an August Moon' (1970) features several impressive visual sequences and succeeds due to some great art direction. A young scientist with an industrial formula to sell, has invited a group of rich industrialist to a small island, along with their wives or lovers. Everyone has a range of motives when the guests and scientist start to be killed off. This even has elements of a spy thriller, via 'Diabolik' at certain moments. Apparently this film has divided critics of Bava. It's a pretty good attempt at a non occult thriller.

Bava has been so tied to his reputation as a director of horror pictures, people tend to not realize he was varied enough to work in the Western genre, as well as sword and sandal Viking pictures, which makes 'Roy Colt and Winchester Jack' (1970) a fun picture. A satirical Western with an affectionate nod to Sergio Leone, a pair of good-natured outlaws on a hunt for a fortune in gold. While not a masterpiece, it demonstrates that Bava could work in the Western genre with a twist. Having said that, it's basically cashing in on the success of 'Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid'.

Next up, 'Bay of Blood' (1971) a.k.a. 'Twitch of the Death Nerve'. One of the seminal films in the development of the slasher horror genre. Much has been written already about the ways in which Sean Cunningham and Miner borrowed from this film in the making of the first two 'Friday the 13th' films. Bava's film is not for the faint of heart, yet unlike the FT13 films, there's a plausible motive behind most of the killings, the greed of a family inheritance. Feminist film critics will often dismiss Bava for being a misogynist, yet often in Bava's pictures women are just as capable to commit murder as men, aside from the fact that Bava shows a real reverence towards women, as complicated souls with desires. Some have dismissed this film and yet, unlike many slasher films where there's a detached focus on the spectacle of violence, one is left not comfortable with the carnage. There's a black, fatalistic, ironic view and subtext here about how violence feeds on itself, as well as an ecological theme that is highly skeptical for the need for humanity.

For most Bava fan's, 'Baron Blood' (1972) has remained a favorite, featuring a good and menacing performance from Joseph Cotton as the resurrected Baron. Elke Sommer's performance isn't as memorable as her role in 'Lisa', which we'll get to in a moment. Bava has always excelled at producing Gothic horror and he delivers this film with a lot of flare. The modern relative of Otto von Kleist, the infamous Baron of the 16th Century, inadvertently resurrects the Baron from the ancient spell of a witch he burned at the stake. Cotton manages a good, menacing and slightly off performance until the revelation of his character.

The less that's said about 'The House of Exorcism', the better, in spite of the fact that Lamberto Bava assisted with the re-shoots. 'Lisa and The Devil' (1973) is another matter. Lisa, a tourist, sees a fresco of the devil leading away the dead, and this triggers her into a Labyrinth of a dark fable. Is this her fevered imagination? Is she being lured by the devil? Is she the resurrected spirit of a lover from another era? 'Lisa' is Bava's most surreal, cryptic and layered film as well as beautiful. Telly Savalas is wonderful as a charming, sophisticated and ruthless beelzebubb. Elke Sommer delivers a compelling performance. A definite break from the usual supernatural film.

'Rabid Dogs' (1974) a.k.a. 'Kidnapped', would have been the definitive final statement from Bava had it seen a proper release. Sadly, when the film's financier died, his entire estate as well as the print of the film was seized by the Italian Court. A marked stylistic difference from Bava's other work, a gritty Euro-Crime drama. During a botched payroll heist, a trio of criminals hijack a woman and a man who is driving a sick child to a hospital. The degradation of the woman is probably one of the most disturbing aspects. A very gritty film that one could see as a real inspiration for a director like Tarantino.

This second set is a little more thin in the extras. Unlike the special segments produced for the 'Black Sunday, Girl Who Knew Too Much', and 'Black Sabbath'. The only new special segments added are from 'Kidnapped', and that disc was already released as a separate package. Considering, that I believe at this writing, Elke Sommer is still alive, I'm surprised that no new interviews were conducted for her reflections about working on 'Baron Blood' or 'Lisa'. There are new commentaries from Bava expert, Tim Lucas for 'Lisa and the Devil, Baron Blood' and 'Bay of Blood', all excellent, the commentary for 'Bay of Blood' is a little looser for a Lucas commentary. An additional older commentary of 'Lisa' with Elke Sommer and Alfredo Leone is included. All of the film prints are excellent and presented in the usual widescreen ratios of 1.85:1 or 1.78:1. The films '5 Dolls' and 'Four Times' are included on a duel disc. Many of the films include trailers, radio spots, or Poster and still galleries. Unfortunately, there's no production liner notes in any of the sets or updated biographies. Thus, the reason for the rating.

Hopefully, this will do well enough to give Anchor Bay grounds to release more titles. Pardon the length, Bava's work is frequently unforgettable, beautiful, macabre, disturbing and unique, don't miss this.",1193529600,45,6555,4.809228039041703
1380023,5,B00004Z4W2,"Mario Bava was one of the most underrated filmmakers of the 20th century. So it's appropriate that the first volume of the ""Mario Bava Collection"" (or ""Bava Box"") was one of the best releases of the last year, and reintroduced us to classics of Bava's that had fallen out of view. The second volume just continues that tradition, with big chunks of classic, stylish horror.

""Baron Blood"" begins the collection -- Baron Otto Van Kleist was a savage, depraved guy who liked to torture people for fun (think Vlad Tepes), until a witch's curse put him out of commission. Centuries later, his descendent Peter (Antonio Cantafora) returns to his family's gothic castle, and decides that he and visiting student Eva (Elke Sommer) will recite the incantation that will return ""Baron Blood"" to the world. Of course, he actually DOES return, and soon Peter, Eva and Peter's uncle are forced to battle his psychotic, deformed ancestor.

""Lisa and the Devil"" is more or less what it sounds like, with our heroine Lisa (Elke Sommer) a tourist going through Italy. She encounters some freaky folklore involving a local painting of the Devil and the Dead -- and a man (Telly Savalas) who eerily resembles the painted Satan. When her travel group is invited by the man to stay at a spooky villa, Lisa becomes ensnared in a maze of nightmares and death.

Then we get something that ISN'T gothic horror -- ""Roy Colt and Winchester Jack,"" a comedy-western. Failed outlaw  Roy Colt (Brett Halsey) has decided to become a law-abiding sheriff -- until he learns of a treasure map to buried gold. Of course, he scurries after it -- but to get his hands on it, he'll have to beat out an Indian prostitute, a dynamiting Russian Reverand, and his old partner Winchester Jack (Charles Southwood).

Then it's ""Four Times That Night,"" a colourful, campy take on Akira Kurosawa's""Rashomon."" Suave Gianni (Brett Halsey) starts pursuing shy, chaste Tina (Daniela Giordano), until she agrees to date him. The night ends with his face scratched and her dress shredded -- at first glance, you'd think he just got too grabby, and she fought him off. But there are four different versions of what happened that night, and none of them agree...

Then it's back to gore and horror, with one of the very first slasher flicks. ""Bay Of Blood"" opens with the death of a countess and her murdering husband. After their demise, the area is crowded with real-estate agents, entomologists, secret heiresses and sex-mad teens looking for a place to party. Then, of course, they start dying off... and not just from one person.

Finally we get ""Five Dolls For An August Moon,"" a remake of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"": Wealthy industrialist George Stark (Teodoro Corr&agrave;) gathers a group of friends and associates on his private island, trying to get a new formula from chemist Fritz Farrell (William Berger).  As the guests get tangled in sexual and business intrigues, someone starts murdering them...

Unlike many directors, Mario Bava didn't need massive budgets or CGI to create his brilliant movies -- just good actors and a haunting backdrop. Gothic castles with dungeons, misty forests, psychedelic islands and clubs, eerie villas, and the dangerous streets of Italy are all used here, and performances that range from brilliant (Steele) to merely good (Halsey).

In fact, Bava was such a brilliant director that he take a cliche or subpar movie (such as ""Baron Blood""), and turn it into something unique and deep. He made use of misty lighting, eerie camerawork,  exquisite use of light and shadow, gory deaths and odd symbolism. A few also splash in some psychedelic colour and sex. And he was usually able to work in an unexpected, sometimes shocking twist to each movie's ending.

""Mario Bava Collection Volume 2"" is a collection of five excellent movies, ranging from brilliant to enjoyable. And it's a good demonstration of Bava's talents, and the kinds of movies he could undertake -- a treasure for horror buffs.",1187395200,74,3995,4.937406855439642
1380024,4,B00004Z4W2,"Italian director Mario Bava (1914-1980) is a giant in the horror film genre. Bava's big break into the field came with his 1960 black and white classic ""Black Sunday"" starring Barbara Steele. This was only the beginning, as Bava churned out a mix of gruesome shockers and non-horror films over the next seventeen years; his films always promised great style mixed with scenes of murder and mayhem. Perhaps Mario's biggest contribution to the horror genre was his 1972 picture ""Twitch of the Death Nerve,"" also known as ""Bay of Blood."" It doesn't take too long to realize ""Friday the 13th"" shamelessly cribbed from this slasher bloodbath. At least two of the murders in the film appear almost unchanged in the first installment of the Jason Voorhees franchise. That's right-Mario Bava gave birth to the modern slasher film. But he also dabbled in non-horror films with the immensely entertaining peplum classic, ""Hercules in the Haunted World"" and this film, the slightly racy romantic comedy ""Four Times That Night."" After watching his contributions to the sword and sandal, horror, and romantic comedy genres, I have to express further admiration for this amazing filmmaker; he could make an entertaining motion picture no matter what the subject.
""Four Times That Night"" is an interesting film about how different people perceive the same event in different ways. It all starts when Tina (Daniela Giordano) meets a suave ladies man named Gianni (Brett Halsey) while walking her dog. Uncomfortable with the attention she's receiving from this guy in a fancy sports car, Tina runs off through the park only to discover Gianni is following her. After some small talk, she agrees to go out on a date with him. Gianni comes to her house to pick her up and the two head out for a night on the town. Then the fun begins, as we see the end result of the date. Tina returns home very late with her dress torn while Gianni has some suspicious looking scratches on his face. A case of someone not keeping his hands to himself, perhaps? Maybe, but maybe not. Bava has great fun as he shows the viewer what happened from four different perspectives. Even at the end of the film, we're not entirely sure whether to believe the ""real"" account of what happened. Can we only rely on the perceptions of those individuals involved in the events?
Tina's account of the evening predictably defines events from a woman's perspective. She explains to her mother that Gianni was an animal who took her dancing, filled her with drink, and then took her back to his bachelor pad with decidedly unwholesome expectations. Her dress was torn as she tried to escape from his apartment, and the scratches on his face came about from the same event. Is this the right explanation for the story? Well, Tina did come home late. Perhaps she's only making up an elaborate excuse to explain away her tardiness to a concerned mother. Gianni sees things quite differently. In his version of events, Tina is a woman of voracious appetites. He could barely keep her out on the dance floor for a minute before she started pestering him to take her to his place. Once there, she used her wily charms to seduce our hero. Gianni's version emphasizes his masculine ability to attract women. The security guard working at Gianni's apartment building tells a different story, a story filled with salacious info about Gianni, Tina, and another couple who arrived at the apartment. He was able to see the events, he explains, because he was doing his job and only happened to see through the apartment window. The final explanation is a funny one, from a psychologist at the end of the film who tries to prove how perceptions are often faulty. This account shows, in mundane detail, how events really unfolded.
""Four Times That Night."" Four different accounts of the same date between a man and a woman. Thankfully, Bava pulls it all off with great humor and a generous portion of ridiculousness. Even more thankfully, he used Daniela Giordano in the role of Tina. This Italian actress is gorgeous, one of the best looking starlets I have ever seen in an Italian film. Keep your eyes on her and ""Four Times That Night"" will be an entertaining experience indeed. There's not much more to say about the movie except to mention the hilarious d?cor in Gianni's apartment as well as the hyper psychedelic club where the two go to drink and dance. Did you think the 1970's had its wacky outfits and furniture? Check this place out. Wow. My eyes hurt after watching this movie. It's all done in great fun, though. Bava adeptly handles the changing storylines and even inserts a little dose of farce and slapstick into the mix.
The DVD version of the film doesn't have many extras beyond a Bava biography-standard for any film in the Bava Collection-along with a filmography, some stills, and a widescreen picture transfer. The quality of the feature varies significantly; I saw significant streaks and grain present in the first twenty minutes or so before the picture improved. But what can you expect? ""Four Times That Night"" is a non-horror Bava film, and thus is not as interesting to his modern day fans as ""Black Sunday"" or ""Twitch of the Death Nerve."" I, however, enjoyed this movie. Perhaps you will too if you look beyond this director's proclivity for shrieks and look at his work as a whole.",1086307200,,5347,4.794149512459372
1380025,4,B00004Z4W2,"For those who enjoy Mario Bava's horror films, this movie will come as a surprise. It shows a side of Bava not normally associated with him. This is a wonderful, thought-provoking film that works as a light hearted comedy and as a character study of human sexuality (which was daring for 1968).
John and Tina meet while Tina is walking her dog. They go out on a date which turns into a disaster when Tina reurns home with a ripped up dress and John with scratched on the forehead. What follows are three different perspectives from John, Tina, and John's doorman who spied on them, on what actually happened, followed by a fourth perspective by a psychiatrist on what could have happened (it's up to the viewer to make up their minds).
This subtitled DVD comes with Mario Bava's biography and filmography, good liner notes from Tim Lucas, and a photo and poster gallery.

1380026,4,B00004Z4W2,"Almost invisible for 32 years, italian director Mario Bava's FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT is now presented by Image in the DVD standard. Shot in late 1968, at the beginning of the erotic wave that submerged the B cinema of Italia, Germany and France, this movie didn't make it in front of the italian censorship and was banned from italian and international screens until 1973. It can not be denied that FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT delivers a certain amount of eroticism due mostly to the sculptural Daniela Giordano, Miss Italy 1966.
Other problematic scenes - for the censors, I mean - include homosexual and lesbian behaviours, mostly verbal and a night in a club for special people. I suppose that the producers of FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT, if they only had produced it two years later, would have a tremendous success because the cinematography is, as always in Mario Bava's movies, original and innovative. The first story, partly narrated "" off "" by Daniela Giordano is a little masterpiece that doesn't leave unharmed womanizers nor innocent sex symbols.
The theme of FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT is well known, the same story is told not from two three different points of view but rather from three different perspectives. A psychiatrist has the difficult task to propose the fourth version which could be or...not the real one.
The copy presented by Image is deceiving if we have in mind the Mario Bava movies that Anchor Bay or VCI released a few months ago. White spots haven't been digitally treated and the colours are very sad. As bonus features, biography and filmography of Mario Bava and english subtitles. Less than the minimum.
A DVD zone discovery.",984873600,2,1647,4.843971631205674
1380027,4,B00004Z4W2,"Frothy, frenetic, and utterly watchable, FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT delivers all the campy charm an Italian sex farce of the late Sixties can deliver.
The film is basically Akira Kurosawa's masterwork RASHOMON (a personal favorite of yours truly) blended with cheap thrills and served in a bold, bright glass sure to make you laugh.
The Plot hinges on a goodie-goodie church girl smitten with and overtaken by a beefcake in a sporty car. They wind up at his ""swinging pad"" and soon the screams (whoops! wrong type of Bava film) I mean, sex begins. Filled with lots of soft-focused bedroom escapades and nudity that will make for laughs more than stimulation, the film gives off that ""sixties happening vibe"" while gently ribbing its source material.
Though not even comparable to the immortal RASHOMON, FOUR TIMES THAT NIGHT certainly delivers the laughs, the fuzzy shots of sex, the ""lewd"" shots of divas doing the Laugh In dance, et al. And the DVD gives those brighter-than-bright colors a sharpness that just about scar the ole retinas.
Bava has done better. I personally think his thrillers are just great, without him men like Argento would not have a job directing films, but this is a gem. I would rank it up there with the cult-a-rific films of the man, Russ Meyers. I mean, if you are looking for a pleasant distraction, you could do a WHOLE lot worse!",979344000,,1357,4.778723404255319

1380086,3,B00004Z4W2,"Although Bava is accomplished in the artsy Italian horror genre (and the titles included in this set are more of the same), I am extremely dismayed that two of Bava's greatest non-artsy films are not included here.  I am referring to ""Caltiki, the Immortal Monster"" and ""The Monster from the Piedras Blancas"".  These two films are available from public domain ripoff artists - it's about time these great films see the light of day.

I seen these as a young child and they scared me and they are still as effective today.  This fact attest that Bava indeed was a master of the genre.  We all don't need artsy - these two films will provide the most fun you and your family can have being scared, I would guarantee.

The movies in this set are O K, but because they are more of the same as the first set - three stars is a fair rating.",1300579200,,834,4.314102564102564
1380087,3,B00004Z4W2,"If you're looking for the Gothic horror at which Volume 1 excelled then there's only one film in this set, Baron Blood.  Although much is made of it it has only a few good moments and comes across as rushed and patched together, and far below the quality of his earlier films.  Ultimately it's easily forgettable.

Otherwise there's little to recommend this set.  The horror selection is inferior and uneven.  Besides Baron there's a tedious slasher film with too many twists, called Bay of Blood.  (Planet of the Vampires would have been a better choice to include in this set.  Why do they always include a Western instead?)

Lisa and the Devil is creative, imaginative, and has some great suspenseful moments.  It's finely crafted and has a much more finished quality than Baron Blood.  It's certainly not a slasher film but rather more of a psychological horror, and needs several viewings to work out the fine points.  The included American release of this one is pointless, unwatchable, and utterly destroys Bava's craft.  Four stars for the original Lisa and the Devil (+) 0 stars for the rest (=) three stars overall.

If you haven't yet purchased Volume 1 then get that instead and put this off till you win the lottery, or if you have money to burn then buy this just for Lisa and the Devil.",1298246400,,1301,4.6784140969163
