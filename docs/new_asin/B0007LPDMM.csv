8048475,5,B0007LPDMM,"This four part series is brilliant. It visualizes the abstract themes of social, economic and racial injustice and the loss of the sacred in an extraordinary style. The main interviewees, Alan Callahan and Richard Rohr provide an anchor to a series that covers everything from rap to Jesus. Sam Keen, Robert Bly and Huston Smith are among the super-star speakers. This series was broadcast on the Hallmark Channel and some local PBS stations, according to the blurbs on the box. It's wisdom and visual elegance deserved more, much more.",1175558400,8,536,5.033707865168539
8048476,5,B0007LPDMM,"These four films are terrific in so many ways. Not only are they antithetical to today's film-making -- the camera is steady, the pans are slow, the music is calming and the words are peaceful -- they abound in images and words that make one think, and think hard, about spirituality, money, power, the meaning of life, the teachings of Jesus and on and on. They take the ancient questions and offer ancient answers in fresh and contemporary ways.  I was a bit let down by the second film (""State of the Union"") in the series (too much blaming ""whitey"" for the condition of some people of color), but the other three make up for that shortcoming and much, much more. If you want a really, really nice dinner, take some ""eating out"" money and buy this meditative series!",1114300800,18,769,4.532374100719425
