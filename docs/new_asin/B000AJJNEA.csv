8078622,1,B000AJJNEA,"Anything goes in the luchador genre. The Man in the Silver Mask teams up with a painfully broad Mexican comedian for some bad cinema. ""Santo Contra Capulina"" (1968) offers little wrestling footage but plenty of groans. ""Family friendly"" in the worst sense.",1430092800,,256,5.119047619047619
8078623,1,B000AJJNEA,Bad quality and bad theme! Mexico had great movies back in the 40s and 50s and some in the 60s but the government of Echeverria and Portillo influenced the film industry in the 70s and 80s and the movies became cheap and vulgar. Mexico's good movies had a renaissance in the late 80s. This movie is definitely part of the old junk. Not recommend it at all.,1384300800,2,356,4.3283582089552235
8078624,3,B000AJJNEA,"Santo Contra Capulina(1968, Santo Versus Capulina) is a misleading title as both A List Mexican movie stars of the 1960's fight on the same side.
Santo, a Mexican wrestler, and Capulina, a half-witted security guard, team up to battle a mobster and his gang of androids! If the plot sounds silly, it's supposed to be! Camp and El Santo go together like bacon and eggs! Face the facts: Santo movies are not exactly works of art. There's a neat animated credit sequence done in the vein of The Pink Panther. Watching Santo battle a well-endowed, sexy, female android was like something out of Austin Powers. Manuel Esperon's music score reflects the lightweight feel of the movie. SCC is worth watching every now and then.",1236729600,,720,4.814516129032258
