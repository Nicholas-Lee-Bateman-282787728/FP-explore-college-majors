3422023,5,B00190XKN4,A FAMILY MOVIEMOVIES WITH ANIMALS ARE MY FAVORITE. THE ACTING IS TRUE TO HEART.THE BAD PERSON ALWAYS GET WHAT THEY DESERVE.,1357257600,,123,4.904761904761905
3422024,5,B00190XKN4,"I loved this movie. Anything with Lee Majors is family friendly.  It is sad that the little girl was so abused, but until we outlaw hitting kids, people will overdo this stupid, senseless manner of child-rearing.  I love when,  ""Grandpa,"" Lee Majors decked the abuser.
My twelve year-grandson and I watched this together.  He was mesmerized  by every second of it.

A lot of very important issues were raised here-Thank you to the producer and actors!
My cousin was dreadfully abused by her real father and we had no idea. He beat her because he did not like her boyfriend.
We often have no idea what goes on in ""respectable"" families.",1340668800,3,635,4.675675675675675
3422025,5,B00190XKN4,I heard alot about this film before and as it was being made because the story itself and the filming took place in my home state of Alabama.  This film has a wonderful message and is a beautiful story.  Some of the story lines are a little short on build or has quick solutions but it would have taken away from the central story so that can be overlooked.  It is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy together and might open discussions and chance to share some memories of growing up.,1279670400,2,493,4.223404255319149
3422026,5,B00190XKN4,"I first saw this movie when I borrowed it from the video store. It was a very good movie!!! It teaches us that child abuse, animal cruelty and racism is wrong and should never be tolerated. I like Lily because she knows what is about to happen and she is looking for peace. I HATE the stepfather!!! just seeing him abuse Lily made me feel like fighting him. That guy is such a bastard!!! I was glad the police arrested him in the movie because he deserved to go to jail. Overall, the movie was good and had a great message to it. I would definately allow my friends to see it. it is a really good movie.",1277596800,4,603,4.11864406779661
3422027,2,B00190XKN4,"a nice story, but bad acting, by a few of the ""b"" stars. a bit thin in the story line, it should be more of a childrens walt disney movie , on a tight budget. the dog steals the show. so does the scenery. the little girl needs more acting lessons, she was the directors daughter, and it shows. next time get a real star. with some personality.",1261872000,,343,4.0588235294117645
3422028,1,B00190XKN4,"This movie is clean enough for families (although the abuse may be rather frightening for small children), but it was terrible - absolutely boring (and I'm very easily amused).  The little girl did a bad acting job, her mother irritated me to no end, and the plot drifts all over the place.  The way her dead father ""calls"" to her is just weird.  It may be Dove approved for being clean, but it is no indication of entertainment value.  Lee Majors is about the only redeeming factor.  My husband and I both consider this to be the worst movie of all times.  When we rent a movie we've never seen before, we joke about how we hope it's not another ""When I Find the Ocean.""",1250812800,,671,4.328
3422029,4,B00190XKN4,"My family enjoyed the movie, and I would recommend it to others. It is an amateur film, so it lacks some of the finesse of a larger budget production, but the story is touching and pulls the viewer into the 1960's South. The film has won honors at film festivals around the nation, and with good reason. This movie will appeal to young and old alike.",1232150400,5,350,4.318181818181818
3422030,2,B00190XKN4,"This movie has some famous actors in it yet the director (tonya holly) apparently could not get them to make this a really good film. The star Lilly, really would she not at least put up a fight to keep from getting beat by her mother's fiance?  How could her mother, grandmother or grandfather not know she was being physically abused by their former daughter-in-law fiance?  If you are going to get into civil rights of the 60s,at least do it some justice!  I was not impressed with this movie and I live in Alabama.",1222473600,2,518,4.431578947368421
3422031,1,B00190XKN4,"This movie boasts that it is a ""family"" movie and is rated PG.  So far, so good.  The cast is quite good--Diane Ladd, Lee Majors and Graham Greene.  Greene is an excellent actor and has received an Oscar nomination in the past.  Well, there won't be any bids for the Oscar on this one.

Despite calling itself a family movie, you get to watch a little girl who cannot come to grips with her father's death, child beating (welts and cuts are all over her back making you wonder how she can walk without crying), a child who has been told that her stepfather to be is going to kill her dog, a child running away and getting caught by the type of animal traps that will snap your leg off, two mountain men left over from Deliverance who slobber over the fact they caught a pretty girl in their trap, a panther stalking the child, the Ku Klux Klan in action and a Black mother and child burning to death in their home.

The camera work is clumsy and toward the end of the film it becomes atrocious.  This is the first film I have ever seen where different scenes are not blended together.  When the scene stops, the screen goes black until the next scene appears.  At first, our family thought the TV had broken. Then we were sorry it hadn't.

I note that the film festivals where the film has won awards are for amateur film makers.  So, maybe I'm being too hard.  Still I can't help but wonder how really good actors got caught in it. They have a terrible time trying to portray their parts due to the script which is mostly in single sentences.  None of the parts are rounded out so all of the acting stays on the surface.  The movie attempts to show why prejudice against the Blacks is wrong and then casts Graham Greene as a stereotype Indian in a kind of 'Tonto' role which is confusing.  In fact, this is where the script loses its way.  It starts with an unhappy child running away and ends up with a sermon on racial discrimination.

Don't waste your money on a home movie.",1220227200,35,1978,4.288409703504043

3422067,5,B00190XKN4,Portrayed cruelty without showing the actual violence and showed the family's response of love for the little girl in many good ways.

3422209,5,B00190XKN4,"This was a surprisingly good movie.  There were so many aspects of interest, from the loss of a father, a cruel soon-to-be stepfather, warm and caring older relatives, adventure via river, racial tension and ignorant backwoodsmen.  Ending up in Selma during the marches was a surprise twist.  I won't say ""all"" but ""most"" of the acting was very good to excellent.",1446336000,4,363,4.918032786885246

The acting is terrible, the writing is worse and don't even get me started on the dialog or the soundtrack. I think the worst is the whole plot, if you want to call it that, it swings wildly back and forth between bad/boring/confusing/awkward and creepy. Honestly I think you'd get better entertainment watching a chia pet grow, this film is so bad I'm surprised that it even made it to dvd without someone shooting themselves as punishment for making this piece of crap. Trust me I was made to sit through this movie, and I actually found myself hoping that these actors and actresses found other movies to star in before they died so that this movie was not their last.  Once more this movie is crap, actually it's worse than crap.",1433030400,3,828,4.47682119205298

3422246,5,B00190XKN4,"Such a delightful story because it is Small Town, USA. The store (Cypress Inn, TN) setting is actually less than 10 miles from my current home (Zip City, AL) and less than 5 miles from where I grew up (Cloverdale, AL). The store operated as Darby's Store during my entire childhood. Because the store layout is similar to the Wild West Saloons, it became my father's favorite building (and mine). My husband is an artist (watercolor) and presented my father with a painting of this store for Christmas in 2000. My father will be gone 10 years on October 21, and Mother returned the painting to us a couple of years after his death. The filmmaker, Tonya S. Holly, also grew up in Cypress Inn. Her mother had a small boutique next to their home, where she sold shoes, accessories and clothing. It was obvious during our visits that Tonya had dreams and aspirations far beyond her geographical location! She now is producing a Bonnie and Clyde movie, but needs funding to complete! I have purchased several copies of, 'When I Find The Ocean,' and plan to purchase many more; along with Bonnie and Clyde.",1370563200,2,1100,4.6461538461538465
3422247,3,B00190XKN4,"The premise of this movie starts out strong enough, but quickly falls to too many branching plot points and clunky dialogue. The panther scene had no drama, because it was clear the actors and the panther were never together on set given the cutaway shots. The scene with the bumbling rednecks was also totally unnecessary, since this was supposed to be drama. It was incredibly jarring whenever these two were on screen. Given some good editing, I could see this film going up at least a star.
Sadly, the director's daughter is the lead, which is a shame given her sub-standard acting chops in contrast to the talents of the other cast members like Lee Majors and Diane Ladd. I've seen plenty of better child actors. It's apparent the director was also loathe to cut any scene with her daughter in it, making this movie almost an hour too long. If you want to see a family movie about a runaway child traveling down the river, go watch a movie about something written by Samuel Clemens",1362960000,3,986,4.607954545454546

8271507,5,B00190XKN4,I love the whole family aspect and the story in the early 60's. This movie made me very emotionally happy inside. But in the beginning it made me extremely angry of how the little girl got abused by her mom's boyfriend and runs away to look for the ocean. She meets some poachers and african-american man to help her from poachers. And of course it backfires at him. You get to see how the white people treat african-american people differently. It happened around in the 60's. It was really a sad time. But the story ends perfectly. It made me very emotionally sad and happy. I would definitely would buy this.,1522886400,,611,4.513513513513513
