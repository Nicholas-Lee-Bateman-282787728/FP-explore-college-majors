8108033,5,B000EBA4NI,Excellent movie and DVD was the remastered version from red sun in full letterbox glory.  Also had the English dub available for anyone interested.  I've always loved this movie so glad to find a quality copy worthy of my collection.,1419811200,,233,4.8
8108034,4,B000EBA4NI,Visually the movie is crisp and clean. This is one of the first (if only) David Chiang as a monk that I know of with Lo Lieh as Pai Mei. The story is good and the fight scenes are good for the genre with David Chiang putting on a good performance. I would highly recommend this movie to round out any Lo Lieh/ Pai Mei collection.,1414886400,2,329,4.0
