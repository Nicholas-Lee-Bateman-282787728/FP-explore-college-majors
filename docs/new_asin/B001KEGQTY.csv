8314928,1,B001KEGQTY,"I expected a wrist lock or two from a DVD Titled ""Art of the Wristlock"". But no. I get a central Cali white belt lesion on basic armbars and almost correctly performed triangles. If you have done BJJ in the passed DO NOT BUY!!! This guy scammed the people taking this seminar and is trying to scam you. Just horrible! I want all of my money back and the 1:45 min I spent going through this dvd(just trying to find anything relevant).
  This will not help you! This DVD will only take time and money from you!
  Roy Dean academy should be ashamed of themselves!!!
  I have been doing BJJ and Aikido for over 5 and 20 years respectively. I have never given anything a one star rating before. STAY AWAY!!",1369180800,,701,4.312977099236641
8314929,5,B001KEGQTY,The D.V.D.'s are extremely informational and I highly recommend to any martial Artist interested in furthering his techniques to buy these D.V.D.s as a learning tool to expand your art.,1358121600,,185,5.2
8314930,5,B001KEGQTY,"This is a must have for any Aikidoka transitioning into BJJ.  I have other products by Roy Dean, and they are all top notch.  Enjoy!",1349654400,,132,4.24
8314931,5,B001KEGQTY,"I know Roy was an Aikido artist before transitioning to BJJ.  It's cool to see him not abandoning his roots and showing the application of wrist locks from Aikido to BJJ.  I don't really agree with the other reviewer who says the production is crap.  I think it works for me and the uniqueness of this DVD alone makes it worth the price.  I enjoyed it and learned a lot of unique stuff that I promise you can't find anywhere else.

I also have to applaud Roy's respect for other martial arts.  In the MMA culture, traditional martial arts are treated with contempt.  With guys like Roy, you get the feeling of respect that comes from his traditional martial arts background as well as the effective technique of BJJ.",1312156800,,716,4.503875968992248
8314932,4,B001KEGQTY,"Interesting tie between Aikido and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. As a long time Aikido practioner, I can say Dean's Aikido is solid but his BJJ appears far more advanced. I wish he showed more examples of using BJJ as a continuation of an Aikido technique, or as a variation from a failed technique.",1300492800,3,290,4.596153846153846
8314933,2,B001KEGQTY,I have Roy Dean's blue belt dvd and I think it's great.  This dvd is a disaster.  It's not worth $5.  The shots are too far out and the instruction and camera angles stink.  Everything the blue belt dvd does well this one fails at.  I'm disappointed b/c I'd really like a solid dvd on wrist locks.  PS  The only 5* review on here at the time of this post is by TJ the guy in the video with Roy Dean...  like he's gonna give it 1*.,1287100800,12,430,3.8620689655172415
8314934,5,B001KEGQTY,"I want to start off by saying that you should not think that this is a DVD set purely focused on wristlocks.  There is a truly massive amount of information contained in these two discs.  While the first disc is primarily an overview of the various jiu jitsu wristlocks and their application (I will talk about this more below), disc 2 contains two very extensive seminars taught by Mr Dean.  I am a blue belt in BJJ (and former Aikidoka) and I can honestly say that even after watching the seminars several times, I have not yet begun to get all of the purely BJJ material out of these, not to mention the cross-over Japanese Jiu Jitsu stuff.  This second disc alone is probably worth the price of the discs.

Now to the wristlocks.  Mr Dean does a really great job of showing the most common forms of wristlocks.  Furthermore, he provides some really valuable insight into how each of these is implemented into different types of Japanese Jiu Jitsu.  For anyone who does not have a background in JJJ, it is a very good introduction to this material.  Even if you have studied these techniques in the past, I can almost guarantee that you will find some new information here.  Of course, the truly unique part of this disc (and is covered in the seminars) is how these techniques work with the ground fighting techniques of BJJ.

This blending of jiu jitsu styles is really where Mr Dean has a lot to offer.  In the past, very few traditional jiu jitsu practitioners have delved into the world of BJJ.  Conversely, BJJ practitioners typically stay away from (and in some cases look down on) traditional forms of jiu jitsu.  This is really too bad because these techniques can work very well together.  Sensei Dean, who holds black belts in Judo, Aikido, Seibukan Jiu Jitsu, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has managed to keep an open mind about all of these approaches and through his own experiences is able to demonstrate very effectively how to use these techniques together.

Whether you are a hard-core BJJer looking to add a little more to your game, an Aikidoka who is curious about BJJ and how their own skills can apply, or just a serious student of martial arts looking for something new, you will not be disappointed with this disc set.  I can tell you from my own experience, that after my first few session of getting destroyed on the BJJ mat, I was afraid that all of those years of Aikido had been wasted.  Because of the material here, I have been slowly finding ways too work all of these valuable techniques back into my game.  I now regularly surprise my BJJ compadres with wristlocks while sparring.  It has been invaluable to me and I am sure that anyone who studies this material will be able to find there own gems.

I highly recommend these discs.",1228694400,21,2764,4.565922920892495
