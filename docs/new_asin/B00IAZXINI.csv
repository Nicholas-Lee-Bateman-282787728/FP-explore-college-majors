6255986,4,B00IAZXINI,Didn't always seem real. Some funny parts were a bit harsh. I really liked the emotional responses from her boyfriends.,1390953600,,119,5.0
6255987,5,B00IAZXINI,My wife and kids are HUGE Ugly Betty fans.  Great price for the entire series.  And the DVD had hours of extras/bloopers/ or whatever.  Great deal.,1366329600,3,147,4.576923076923077
6255988,5,B00IAZXINI,"UGLY BETTY is humble and flashy, warmhearted and ruthless, slick and comfy.  The way it straddles two seemingly disparate worlds, and centers on a quirky, less-than-beautiful, yet deeply charming and lovable female lead is a rare move in the glitz-obsessed entertainment biz. Fererra is the heart and soul of this show.  UGLY BETTY will wend its way into your heart--don't miss it!",1357776000,4,381,5.129032258064516

8640550,5,B00IAZXINI,"Ugly Betty is a wonderfully-clever, heartfelt, comedy centered around Betty Suarez (America Ferrera) an a""dork""able social butterfly; who will steal your heart after the first episode.

My package arrived yesterday; a week before the scheduled date which is was pretty impressive since it was shipping out from the UK to the U.S. and the price was unbeatable even with shipping. My only complaint was that shipping package was quite flimsy, which resulted in damage to the spine of the box set.",1469491200,3,494,5.098765432098766

8640552,5,B00IAZXINI,"Every now and then, a show comes on that is like nothing else on TV.  Ugly Betty, the story of a strong, centered-- and, let's face it, probably colorblind--young woman who works with fashionistas at a couture magazine, is one of those special shows.  It has a unique, zany energy--a mix of sparkly wit, unpredictable adventure, and warm moments between the characters. America Ferrara's Betty has a heart of gold and a conscience to match, and she and her loving family provide a calmer counterpart to the over-the-top schemes of the rich and famous.  The colorful sets and designer clothes are fun to look at, and the clever banter between the characters (especially Marc and Amanda) will keep you laughing throughout the show. Every character seems like a stereotype at first glance, but if you watch long enough, you will get to know and love them all as complex people. Some moments even bring a tear or two. I spent a week watching Ugly Betty while recovering from painful oral surgery, and I remember that week fondly.  Even with nostalgia.  'Nuff said.",1437091200,2,1060,4.802197802197802

8640554,5,B00IAZXINI,It's a great show! Eric Mabius is so cute! I recommend this show to everyone. This show should have lasted a lot longer! I like America too!!,1391904000,2,141,4.2592592592592595
