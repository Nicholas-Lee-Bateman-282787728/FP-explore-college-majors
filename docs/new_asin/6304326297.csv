853465,5,6304326297,"After removing the huge amount of censorship that existed in Spain during the dictorship of General Franco there was a realease of tension. This is evident in comparing Jamon Jamon(Ham Ham) and Marcelino Pan y Vino(Mareclino Bread and Wine). The first example was done after the removal of the censorship; therefore, not only are there things that would never be acceptedby the government, but moreover, Jamon Jamon takes that extra step by making a parody of everything that is typically Spanish. An example of this is having two people fighting with legs of Jamon. Ham being something which Spain is known for like Canada is known for hockey. I thought that it was very funny; just imagine having two people fighting over the love of a woman with two hockey sticks. On the other hand we have the book in question Marcelino Pan y Vino which was made during the censorship. This implies that only things that the government thought to be acceptable was allowed. For example there would be nothing against the government or the church. The author gave the government exactly what they wanted. It was made right after the civil war in Spain and the country needed help with it's small population and the rebuilding of Spain; therefore, the author makes everyone have a big family and everyone helping one another. An example of this is the town people helping the monks rebulid the monastery. This worked well because the effect was that people had more children and a lot of the children born at the time were named Marcelino. I enjoyed both of these two works for two different reasons. I liked Marcelino Pan y Vino because it is unbelieveable that it had such a strong effect to have people name their children Marcelino. However, I would have to give my preference to Jamon Jamon because of the evident Freedom of Speech and Expression taht was lacking in Marcelino Pan y Vino. It is hilariously funny. It is very interesting learning the culture and history of Spain studying works like this. Even though Jamon Jamon may not be for everyone because some people might no understand the humor and just think that it is some strange European thing. An example of this ""weirdness"" ... . I highly recommend Jamon Jamon and Marcelino Pan y Vino to anyone with an open mind and is looking for a really fun way to learn a little bit about the history and culture of Spain.",973641600,3,2367,4.706024096385542
853466,5,6304326297,"This film is a hilarious and sometimes disturbing glimpse into the inner lives of these Spanish characters.  Jamon, Jamon seeks to make a statement on the Spanish archetypes: the macho young male seeking to make life more exciting, the weak, desperate heir and his manipulative, sensual mother (here it is hard not to think about Oedipus) and finally the vulnerable, sexy young senorita whose sole reason for living is to nurture the fantasy of having an entire closet dedicated to shoes.  The director's interest is in taking Spanish stereotypes and playing them out to their full consequences, with liberal use of the surreal and the absurd.  There is not a more powerful symbol in this movie than ham.  Ham symbolizes the carnal desires, the painful cravings that each of these characters struggles with.  Ham is a symbol of power, privelege, decadence and opportunity.  This unlikely choice of ham as a central theme almost makes it necessary to create the film as an absurdist, surrealistic parable of life, which it accomplishes in the most delightful and lusty manner.  These characters do much to attempt to control their destinies and the destinies of others, but the outcomes are always skewed or offset by the presence of ham; their intentions may be pure, but the end result seems to be invariably  tainted, or made richer, by ham and all that it symbolizes.",972864000,2,1370,4.951965065502184

It is not bad in its own right, but it  is not the best film to come out of Spain in recent years.  I am sure there  are many wonderful Spanish films being made every year; we just don't see  them.

853803,5,6304326297,"OK, maybe pretty well after Franco remained dead (a little Chevy Chase joke for you middle agers there).  BUT...Ever wonder where Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz got their start (Jordi Mola too, if I recall)? I first saw this in the Liceu Theater in Barcelona. I loved it then. I love it more now. Almost as much as I must love myself to have noted the business about having seen it on release in Barcelona. Let's try to forget that foray into one upsmanship, shall we?  There are things in this movie I continue to think of regularly over the years, though the story itself is nothing that incredible - a fairly typical Romeo and Juliet mashed up with classic rich man poor man themes. It was definitely when I began loathing the fact that I would never be as handsome and casualally masculine as Javier Bardem. (CURSE YOU, BARDEEEEEEEEEEEM!  THough I met him on a flight that got stuck in Madrid before he was super-famous, and he was very nice)  I hope one day they bring Bigas Luna's ""Airbag"" to US video...he makes movies that really connect you to the spirit of a more modern Spain that has a solid grip on its past, and the quirky humor and disposition of its wonderful people!",1421366400,4,1184,4.493023255813953

For years i had a second copy of Jamon, Jamon, the first time Cruz and Bardem were together, in a fateful move that years later would make them a couple.  Both were dazzlingly beautiful and  given ample opportunities to flaunt their charms.  An irreverent premise (a contest to determine what male has the best equipment to launch a line of male underwear that quickly turns into a tragedy of Lorca's proportions.  I have waited for years for it, since many of Bigas' mvies, including his awarded La teta y la luna, can only be found in Region 2 format.  Get it NOWW!

A word of caution: this film contains all of the themes that Bigas Luna was going to obsess over in subsequent movies, especially his fixation on female breasts, stallion males, and enough soap to fill an entire TV afternoon.  Not for minors, not for schools.

Bardem's character is really a ham salesman, hence the title.  I think this movie had a direct influence on Almodovar's early ""What Have I done to Deserve This"".",1365206400,,1096,4.545918367346939

853974,4,6304326297,"When discussing Almodovar's films, one almost always has to discuss them in terms of what they almost are, or started to be, or could have been. When recently asked to name one that actually fulfilled its promise, the film that came to mind wasn't his -- it was this one.

Interesting, the most extreme reviews here seem driven by the presence of sexual encounter in this movie -- either for or against. I don't find that the presence or absence of sexual interaction determines the quality of a film, but this one certainly has plenty of it. Can this be justified in terms of art?

This is no mere date flick; this is mythic symbolism, which is a valid art form. That we are not intended to take this film literally is evident by the closing scene, which leaves the characters in deliberately unnatural poses. I do not know recent Spanish history well enough to comprehend everything this movie is showing us, but it is saying several things quite strongly, and saying them in large, broad strokes.

This is the problem with being literary rather than literal: many people are annoyed by seeing a film that doesn't make it's message plain & simple enough for everyone. Almodovar avoids this trap by favoring doses of the ridiculous, thus shorting both his message and our criticism; Bigas didn't take such an easy road.

And - to be fair - he may not have entirely succeeded. But this movie attempts much more than its lurid and seemingly comedic premise; time will judge the result. Put this one next to Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and see what you think.",1281916800,,1548,4.618181818181818

Apparently it is not available in US NTSC format. However, this transfer is pretty decent quality if you have a multi-region player - with some caveats. It is delivered in the annoying letterbox format, a 16:9 image within a 4:3 frame.

On a 4:3 screen, the subtitles appear in the letterbox area, which is OK. However, on a widescreen TV, if you zoom in so that the image fills the screen, you lose the subtitles. If you stay zoomed out, you end up with a small image surrounded by black on all sides.",1274400000,2,713,4.5625

853977,5,6304326297,"'Jam&oacute;n, jam&oacute;n' is a tremendously creative movie by director Jos&eacute; Juan Bigas Luna and his writing partner Cuca Canals (Son de mar, Volav&eacute;runt, B&aacute;mbola, Lumi&egrave;re et compagnie, La Teta y la luna, and Huevos de oro), a film that is a dark comedy but not in the ho-ho manner: the comedy is the human comedy and watching it evolve may at times make the viewer avert the eyes because of its truthfulness.

Silvia (a very young Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) lives with her prostitute mother (Stefania Sandrelli) in a truck stop bordello, obviously in the lower caste of society.  Silvia works in the Under Wear factory owned by the parents (Anna Galiena and Juan Diego) of Penelope's boyfriend Jos&eacute; Luis (Jordi Molla).  Penelope is pregnant by Jos&eacute; Luis but of course this low class association will never do to his mother so she sets about to distract Silvia from Jos&eacute; Luis's attentions.  Enter a ham seller and wannabe bullfighter Ra&uacute;l (the very buff and hunky young Javier Bardem) who is a macho as they come (a night scene where Ra&uacute;l and his handsome friend played by Tom&aacute;s Mart&iacute;n fight a bull in the nude is the pinnacle of machismo!) whom the mother hires to distract Silvia.  But the plot thickens when the intended coupling becomes crazily rearranged (Ra&uacute;l has sex with Jos&eacute; Luis's mother, Jos&eacute; Luis seeks out the corporal companionship of Silvia's prostitute mother, Jos&eacute; Luis's father grasps for Silvia, etc) until the sextet comes to a strange ending on the twilight plains of Spain.

This color-saturated movie by cinematographer Jos&eacute; Luis Alcaine is a visual delight and the accompanying musical score by Nicola Piovani adds just the right amount of spice.  But it is the extraordinary acting of the young actors who were to become international stars - Pen&eacute;lope Cruz,  Javier Bardem, and  Jordi Moll&agrave; - that bring the excitement and aura of sensuality to this very controversial film.  Jos&eacute; Juan Bigas Luna is a terrific combination of Dal&iacute;, Almod&oacute;var, Cocteau, and Bu&ntilde;uel, but he carries his dark comedic sense into the critical eye of the human microscope.  The film is a delight and a joy to see, if only to watch the three big names at their early stages!  Grady Harp, November 06",1162771200,18,2349,5.251336898395722

I was surprised to find that this movie made it past the censors and remains available today. Underage nudity is generally permitted in non sexually-explicit situations (ie, family photos at a naturist colony). However, ""Jamon Jamon"" contains fairly explicit scenes with [...]

If underage teen sexploitation is your thing, then dig in. If not, Penlope Cruz fans should skip this boring flick and buy the funnier, sexier, non-explicit ""La Belle Epoque"" instead.",1100822400,3,619,4.9423076923076925
854079,4,6304326297,"I had the privilage of seeing ""Jamon Jamon"" in the theatre several years ago, thank you.

Anyway, ""Jamon Jamon"" (translation: Ham Ham) takes it's story straight from those overblown dramas of the 1980's like ""Dynasty"" or ""Knot's Landing"".  The twist is just how far these characters will go to fulfill their ""lustful"" desires in spite of the consequences.  Although every character in the film is dead serious, this is actually a comedy, and not a bad one at that.  A sort of ""Dallas goes Airplane"" without the cheap gags.

To describe the plot without giving away too much is daunting, but here goes;  A young man has gotten his girlfriend pregnant.  His parents, who run a successful underwear business, dissaprove of their son marrying the daughter of a prostitute.  So his mother hires one of the underwear models to seduce the girlfriend, but the mother falls for the underwear model.

With me so far, good.  Here's where it gets complicated;

The young man (remember him?) is also having a dallience with the young girl's mother (the prostitute). Meanwhile, the underwear model manages to seduce the young girl, but is still bedding down with the mother (the underwear Mother).  The young man has now become insanely jealous which leads to a confrontation with the underwear model.  The father of the young man is about the only character with his head on straight, but even he gets involved in this mess.

The performances are first rate and the sex/nude scenes are plentiful.  Perhaps the most outlandish is a bullfight with the matadors in the nude (definately something for the ladies...and perhaps a few guys as well).

Those interested in seeing what a young (19 years old at the time) Penelope Cruz looks like nearly naked will not be dissapointed.  This film is definately not for the kids.

Overall, ""Jamon Jamon"" is a very well made comedy whose laughs come from the characters, not from any ""jokes"".  I can certainly recommend it to those looking for a more ""sophisticated"" sex comedy.  The type that American film makers have trouble pulling off...so to speak.

Trivia: The box cover depicts probably the most dramatic sex scene in the film.  Problem is, the two people depicted are not the actors in the scene.  Perhaps it's a rip on Romance novel book covers?",1092096000,29,2279,4.847150259067358

854082,2,6304326297,"Jamon Jamon is one of those spainish films you watch because Penelope Cruz is in it, but, by the time the naked bullfight scene rolls around, if not before, you realize that not even the best looking actress around can make up for such a bizarre and ridiculously sketchy peice of cinema. Meant to be funny, the outrageous sexual innuendo that is the script is just too strange to be humerous or even erotic.
  The plot set up in the beginning of the movie, which had potential, breaks down as a result of the plethera of random hook-ups, many implausible, and by the time Silvia makes out with her fiance's father, one is just too wierded out to care. Some themes adressed in the movie are masculinity and the role of the man and woman, but through poor acting and trippy cinematography, even these are too blured to amount to any semblance of profoundness. All in all, if you're looking for a good movie with Penelope Cruz in it, watch Belle Epoque.",1052870400,2,950,4.517441860465116
854083,3,6304326297,"I picked up 'Jamn Jamn' because of all the teasers about it being in the 'style of Almodvar.'  Let's just say that Bigas Luna's tale apparently lost something in the translation.
The only reason to rent/buy this film - and it's a pretty good one - is to get an early look at three major stars of Spanish cinema: Jordi Molla, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz (according to IMDB, they would have been 25, 24 and 19 (!) years old respectively while filming 'Jamn Jamn' in 1993 for a 1994 release).
An interesting comparison: watch this film, then follow it up with the 2002 Spanish release 'Second Skin' ('Segunda Piel'), starring Bardem and Molla as protagonists in a *completely different* love triangle.  In those 8 - 9 years, there's amazing growth in their acting abilities.  'Jamn Jamn' looks like a school play in comparison.",1051574400,,828,4.736111111111111
854084,3,6304326297,"This movie by Bigas Luna combines elements of irony and surrealism in a very disfunctional setting where almost nothing works the way it's supposed to, based on ""normal"" thinking (whatever that translates into for each and everyone of us). The movie, almost from beginning to end is very unpredictable (which is good) and brings out very sexually-charged performances by the entire cast, but very specially by now-superstars Penelope Cruz (Woman on Top, Blow, Captain Corelli's...) and Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls).
My ""issue"" with this movie is that it doesn't qualify as a comedy altogether, due some of its very disturbing scenes. It also doesn't succeed, in my opinion, at being a parody of the Spanish macho man and some other typical (yet repressed during the Franco times) elements of Spanish culture. And finally, although it attempts to (with the pig, bull and ham imagery), I don't think of it necessarily as a good surrealist movie (in the style of a Bunuel or a Fellini). I think it is more a combination of the sexual drive typically behind Bigas Luna's movies and a good dose of Oedipus complex sprayed (portrayed in an interesting way). Trying to be too many things, it ends up being like a potato omelette (""tortilla de patatas"".) In all honesty, in the end it left me with nothing but a few laughs at its ironies.",1000944000,6,1336,4.8384279475982535
854085,5,6304326297,"O.K. it may not be a five star movie, more like four but if you're a Penelope Cruz fan like me you'll love it. Seeing her half clothed body frequently throughout the movie makes you glad they invented rewind and pause controls on your antiquated vcr. Seriously though this is a very sexy and smart movie about two of the things most of us love most, food and sex. Spanish cinema has a certain flair for exploiting those issues most dear to us in the most unusual manner. The movie is very funny, more so if you understand Spanish culture, and the imagery used to convey the issues at hand are most visually dramatic. The story evolves primarily around the life of Jose Luis who is the wealthy son of a domineering mother whose family is in the underwear business. Not sexy yet? Enter Javier Barden(""High Heels"" and ""Live Flesh)"" as Raul, a novice bullfighter, underwear model and soon to hired lover to interfere with Jose Luis's love interest. He's a confident Spanish stud who takes no prisoners in his conquering of women. Still doesn't sound sexy? O.K., now for the best part of this movie, Penelope Cruz is Sylvia the pregnant girlfriend of Jose Luis and is the leading lady in this tale of twisted love triangles. The sexy Sylvia is torn and her future in-laws make her decision more difficult. Lots of unpredictable liasons develop that may be immoral but if taken as a satirical romp quite funny and entertaining as opposed to shocking. Some of the scenes are a riot like when the two machos sneak into a bull ranch late at night for a little clandestine bullfighting by the moonlight. The daring bravado of the two machos is illustrated so beautifully and the scene transition is just as wild as they run from their persuers. Without describing and ruining the scene suffice to say that the fact that two young men would go to such great lenghts to prove their macho is hilarious. It is scenes like this that make for memorable Spanish cinema with a quirky message hidden in celluloid reminiscent of Aldomovar. Very funny stuff worth the price of admission alone just to see a very young Penelope Cruz at her sexiest.",979344000,30,2126,4.626984126984127
854086,4,6304326297,"With the artistic repression that Spain felt with the dictatorship of Franco, many artists have expressed themselves above and beyond anything that North Americans are used to.  Jamon Jamon is a film that pokes fun at controversial issues, something that is a little touchy in our own society.  We can watch this movie and laugh, thinking of it as foreign but in the end finding that it represents many things that we are faced with in our own society.  Some people may see it as being too outrageous and on the edge, but then if you just open your mind and laugh at the situations, you will soon see the true meaning.  We have a prostitute who's daughters boyfriend is one of her clients.  That daughter then becomes pregnant with said boyfriend who's family is rich, enough said, the rest of the movie is a battle of love, sex, machismo and money.  There are many spanish symbols in this movie that are important in understanding the serious themes, so I recommend that if you do decide to watch this movie, do it with an open mind and a sharp eye (pay close attention to the pig and bull references) Don't try and compare this film to american movies because Jamon Jamon's storyline is some how more appealing, entertaining and sophisticated than any american movie you have ever seen.",973814400,5,1288,4.62719298245614

But i purchased the film for total of $11.99 including shipping as i have hunted this film for more ten years. To me it was worth it to finally see it but i will still look to buy better version made by a american film company. This mexican ""zima"" company must not have the funds to create top notch DVD quality and features. Over all im glad to have got to see the film but it needs a better production distribution company to release it. I give it 3 stars...
