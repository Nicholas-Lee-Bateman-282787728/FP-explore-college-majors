Could they have slipped ""It Ain't Hay""in place of a lame documentary? Sure, but then what do they sell for Christmas this year? Shame on them.",1223510400,9,377,4.815384615384615

Sorta like ELVIS PRESSLY movies, the budget went to the actors instead of the film.
Presley made some BIG money in some CHEAP films.
Universal Studios (saved from bankrupcy by Abbott and Costello) were sorta like
Columbia Studios in the way they treated The Three Stooges--- show US the money!

3557995,5,B001EXE2Y2,"While I realize the issue with ""double-dipping"" has irked the previous reviewers, other studios have milked their products far worse than Universal has in this case (be thankful you're not a fan of Paramount's original Star Trek series).

As a lifelong fan of Abbott and Costello, I am quite thankful that the Boys are getting their due - finally!  Universal has produced an attractive package for the actors that kept their studio afloat for many years.  (I read where 1941's ""Buck Privates"" was Universal's highest grossing film until ""Jaws"" in 1976)  This set comes in a handsome, trunk-like case.  It includes a very nicely produced booklet - Abbott and Costello: The Universal Story.  They have added 5 new audio commentaries (on Buck Privates, Hold That Ghost, Who Done It?, The Time of Their Lives, and Abbott and Costello meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde).  AND we are finally getting ""It Ain't Hay"" after either many years of negotiations with the Damon Runyon estate or the discovery of a usable print, which ever rumor was true.

I will be happy to replace the ""Franchise"" volumes with this displayable collector's edition of the greatest comedy team of all time!",1220486400,12,1170,4.903553299492386
3557996,1,B001EXE2Y2,"I agree with several others here who chastised Universal for double-dipping with ""It Ain't Hay"" on this release.  It's a slap in the face for all the fans who bought all the previous releases, as I have.  I'm not spending over $80 for one film.  All this does is make Universal (and all the other studios that do this, Paramount and Warner included) look very bad, and confirms my decision to stop giving these arrogant companies my money by not ""upgrading"" my entire DVD collection to Blu-Ray and buy a good upconverting 1080p DVD player instead.",1220313600,35,547,4.677083333333333
3557997,5,B001EXE2Y2,"It is a shame that it seems this holiday season so many studios are just double-dipping previously released material. Abbott and Costello are probably worthwhile purchases because, as someone else has already pointed out, the previous collections were on double-sided discs. However, this does seem to hurt the true fan who bought those double-sided disc collections by making them purchase the same films yet again in order to get something that will last long term.

SOME OF THERE GAGS WERE A LITTLE MUCH BUT OVERALL THEY WERE GOOD CLEAN FUN AND GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR A 10 YR OLD BOY. TV WAS YOUNG SO THE MOVIES WERE STILL THE BEST SOURCE OF ENTERTAINMENT.
""HOLD THAT GHOST"" WAS AN EARLY FAVORITE ALONG WITH ""HIT THE ICE"" AND ""WHO DONE IT"". WHEN ""A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN"" CAME OUT, THAT WAS THE BEST TO DATE IN 1949.
ALL TWENTY EIGHT FILMS IN THE PACKAGE ARE MAGNIFICANTLY RESTORED AND PERFECT IN PICTURE AND CONTENT.
OLNY A FEW ARE NOT UP TO SNUFF IN STORY QUALITY. MY WIFE AND I ENJOYED SOME OF THE MORE OBSCURE LIKE ""TIME OF THEIR LIVES"",  ""LITTLE GIANT"" AND ""IN SOCIETY"". THEY ARE NOT SHOWN ON TV EVEN IN THE EARLY 70'S WHEN A&C WERE MAKING A REVIVAL. THERE IS ALSO GREAT SINGING AND DANCING AND BAND NUMBERS MINGLED IN A FEW OF THE FILMS!
I HAVE A LARGE COLLECTION OF THE MOVIES ON 16MM FILM BUT RARLY SHOW THEM AS IT IS A HASSLE.
I DEFINATLY RECOMEND THE A&C UNIVERSAL FILM COLLECTION OVERALL AS IT IS A GREAT WAY TO SPEND AN LONG WINTER'S EVE WATCHING THEIR ANTICS AND JUST GOOD ""CLEAN"" FUN !",1504310400,5,1186,4.224669603524229

The set came yd and I liked the fact their was a guide book that was very informative. It tells what movie is on each disc and the dates of each movie etc. was a good guide and a good index.

Thouroghly impressed w this set and haven't dug into it yet. Look forward to returning here and talking more about each movie. Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein is my favorite movie of theirs so far. Has Frankenstein Dracula and wolf man.

Great to have the complete universal set all in one package to dig into.

Update: I want to mention that every movie Abbott and Costello made w universal is included. The set is organized chronologically. The guide is very helpful. It gives a date for each movie and some background on each movie. Like why Abbott and Costello meet the killer, Boris Karloff had so many title changes.

They also include reprints of what appears to be original movie prints of the posters.

I like  the set as the bulk of their movies is right there the set is in a logical order the guide is useful and the movies so funny at least so far.

I grew up watching A&C on Saturday mornings and fell in love with them. I'm sharing them with my kids now.  As with most everyone else in the world, our favorite routine is Who's On First from the Naughty Nineties. This is a great collection of A&C that is also packaged very nicely.  I know my family and I will enjoy these for years to come. If you love A&C and good, clean humor, I highly recommend this collection.",1479686400,,563,4.233644859813084

3558065,5,B001EXE2Y2,"In, Abbott & Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection, we get just that, all 28 of the comedy-classics they made for Universal Pictures between the years---1940 and 1955; until they finally parted ways and ended the greatest comedy-duo of-all-time! Most Americans (and people around the world), of my generation and of earlier ones, will cherish the memories that Abbott and Costello truly symbolize and represent for many of us---a nicer America, time and place, etc. Who doesn't remember watching the Abbott and Costello comedy-features that were broadcast (on free-television, no cable yet, or pay per view), almost every Sunday afternoon---once upon a time? True or not, many of us cannot help but recall fond memories and nostalgic indulgence when, we once again watch these timeless and wonderful comedies. And funny and silly they certainly were and, I love every minute of it!

There are 15 discs in all: 2 discs in 7 separate folders, with 2 features per disc (the last folder contains 3 discs; with the last disc consisting of bonus features, etc.). My favorite Abbott and Costello features are all here: In Society 1944, Hit The Ice 1943,  Buck Privates 1941, Hold That Ghost 1941, Who Done It 1942, The Naughty Nineties 1945, Pardon My Sarong 1942, Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein 1948, Abbott And Costello Meet The Killer, Boris Karloff 1949, etc., etc. I just wanted to highlight the ones I cherish and love the most. I wonder if the younger generation can/will appreciate this truly and genuine part of American culture/history. I know that I and, many more people like myself am very grateful that these films have been restored/re-released in this wonderful collection and, is available for everyone to enjoy as their very own. Thank-you---Universal Pictures.

All the films have been digitally re-mastered to a pristine state, the picture and sound quality is absolutely fantastic. NTSC, English (subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish), plus lots of extras, 44 page booklet, etc., NR

Love and Peace,

3558241,5,B001EXE2Y2,"If you're reading this then either you're introducing yourself to Abbott And Costello for the first time or you love their films and want to know what you're getting.  Well, brother, with the exception of a few movies that are available elsewhere, you have the vast majority of their comedic genius in one spot.  Abbott & Costello dominated the movies as the ultimate comedy team through the Forties and Fifties with smash hit after smash hit and they made funny movies, believe me.  Their brand of comedy was honed in Burlesque and Vaudeville, but mostly Burlesque and that distinguished them from other comedians of the day...and allowed them to introduce some of the classic con routines of Burlesque that hadn't been done on film before.  It was the savvy of Bud and the eternal child like reactions of Lou that played out against so many settings and genres with hilarious results.

There are 28 movies in this collection all done at Universal Studios and they are on 14 single sided disks, two movies to a disc, which does not affect the quality of the picture at all, and almost all of them in pristine prints. There is a 15th disc with some special features. You can't go wrong with this collection.

I augmented this with four of their post Universal Warner Brothers movies.  Two of which (Lost in a Harem and A&C Go To Hollywood are available on a single disc release right here at Amazon...and two classics now available from the WB Archive collection Rio Rita and A&C Meed Captain Kidd (with the great Charles Laughton mixing it up with the duo) both remastered.  Some archive collection movies are available here on Amazon too - so look here first!!!)

The missing films are either vanity projects that don't contain the same chemistry and their last film Dance With Me Henry which is hard to find but is available on Amazon Instant Video to rent or buy.

Hope you enjoy as much as I did!!",1403740800,54,1902,4.650746268656716

All 28 movies, not all good but certainly all fun, all lovingly packaged in a great collectors box with a nifty little book, documentaries and commentaries in a  groovy 15 disc- set at a great price.  None of their films were classics in the true sense but Bud and Lou were something else.  Their craziness and nutty routines went beyond classic; they became part of us and our lives as we grew up and have remained treasures of remembrance past when life was just that little bit simpler. Don't even try to rate these movies or watch them in order.  Just  take a peek in this box of treasures and pluck a title out and sit back and enjoy.  That's what I've been doing and at the sight and sound of the Universal globe, know I'm going to enjoy a bit of old fashioned corn delivered by those two geniuses : Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.",1387929600,2,1029,4.441489361702128

3558297,5,B001EXE2Y2,"""Abbott & Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection"" is a great box set.  Its packaged in a box designed as a steamer trunk, adorned with stickers of various Abbott and Costello movies.  Each movie is remastered in glorious black and white, with production notes, and theatrical trailers for most films.  After their movie debut in ""One Night In The Tropics"" (1940), it's easy to see why Abbott and Costello would never play supporting roles in movies again.  In my opinion, their masterpiece is ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948).  It was only natural that Universal's classic monsters appear in a film with Universal's classic comedy duo.

The final disc includes three bonus features.  Comedian Jack E. Leonard (1910-1973) narrates ""The World Of Abbott and Costello.""  That collection of movie clips would have been better served without his jarring narration.  ""Bud Abbott and Lou Costello Meet The Monsters"" provides a lot of insightful information about the duo's meetings with Frankenstein, the Killer, Boris Karloff, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the Mummy.  ""Abbott and Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld"" provides the most biographical information on Bud and Lou, and includes clips from their home movies.  This box set is an absolute must have for every Abbott and Costello fan.",1385769600,9,1325,5.261904761904762

3558304,5,B001EXE2Y2,"This boxset is great! The packaging is great!  And the movies are in chronological order.  These are all of the movies Abbott & Costello did with Universal Pictures.  If you check out internet movie database .com :  Rio Rita (MGM), Lost in a Harem (MGM), Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in Hollywood (MGM), The Noose Hangs High (Abbott & Costello Productions Inc.), Africa Screams (Huntington Hartford Productions), Jack and the Beanstalk (Hal Roach Studios), Abbott & Costello Meet Captain Kidd (Warner Bros.), and Dance With Me, Henry (MGM) are not included in this boxset.  That's because these movies that Abbott & Costello made were mostly for MGM, and a few small production companies.  In order to get these movies to FULLY COMPLETE your Abbott & Costello collection, you'd have to buy them individually since MGM hasn't put together their own compilation boxset of their movies.  Get this boxset over the small four volume boxsets, because the movie ""It Ain't Hay"" (a Universal Production) was not included in the four volume boxsets.  You could buy ""It Ain't Hay"" in an individual dvd case by itself, but why do that when you could spend a little extra and buy this complete Universal Pictures Collection boxset that includes the movie ""It Ain't Hay"", plus get a booklet with the production notes to all the movies and small biographies on Abbott & Costello.

So, I recently bought the first in the individual sets of their movies on DVD covering the first of their 8 Universal films.  Having recaptured the magic and pleasure of these movies I thought I'd look into getting the others in that series only to find this complete set of their Universal films.  For A&C fans this is a great collection.  True, all but one film has been released previously on DVD and basically what you're getting here are the previously released DVD versions + that one film.  BUt for people like me that didn't have all the other previous versions this is a must.  The mastering, the menus, the bonus features, the packaging and booklet plus the price make it well worth the investment.  I'm loving reliving the fun I had as a child watching these movies and discovering a number I had never seen before.  Apart from these films, there are 8 others made for studios other than Universal plus their TV work which are all available on DVD.

You would see two films, 6 to 8 cartoons and a weekly serial, typically these were 15 episodes, each one ending in a cliff hanger to bring you back next week.
One of my favorite movies were the Abbott and Costello.  The one that still sticks in my mind is the Frankenstein, every time the Wolf Man changed from the man to the wolf, I would run out to the lobby.  Never saw him change until I received this set.  The major difference I see in movies today is imagination, in the old movies, a lot was left to your imagination, today, nothing is left for you to think about.

If you're like me, and don't own these films on DVD, then getting this collection is a no-brainer. The films are obviously not Blu-rays, but I've always found black and white films to look sharp regardless of their standard definition nature. These are no exception. They look great on my HDTV, especially when they are upscaled.

3558346,4,B001EXE2Y2,"I have to agree with others that Universal is double dipping here with the re-release of the very same movies that us loyal fans plunked down our hard earned money for. However, there are some great benefits to this set that did not exist on the prior sets. First let me list the bad, it's a duplicate of all four of universals prior sets with three major differences. One the inclusion of ""It ain't Hay"", two they are using a better technology on single sided disks making them playable for all, and lastly the ending of A&C meet Frankenstein has been butchered.  The good, as already mentioned they are using single sided discs that are compatible with all dvd players. They are including a nice book. And, for me, I lost 3 of my 4 sets that I had to Hurricane Sandy, I can replace all of my lost A&C with one purchase. I am still not certain if I will do that, or just repurchase used copies of the other three sets. But, either way, it's Abbott And Costello, they have made us laugh for years and years. I think if you own the original four sets and they work for you, keep em'. If you don't then you should consider buying this set its' well worth the money.

Ghosts from the time of the American Revolution try to clear the curse of being accused of treason to free their souls. I bought the collection because of my memories watching Abbott and Costello on weekends on TVs as a kid. Every movie title that begins ""Abbott and Costello Meet the""...can be watched over and over again and you will laugh every time. They are also perfect for Halloween Time.

3558348,5,B001EXE2Y2,"to the list of great show business misconceptions you can add the notion of Laurel & Hardy being the greatest comedy team of all time. don't get me wrong: i certainly couldn't call myself a comedy connoisseur if i couldn't appreciate Stan & Ollie. and they certainly gave us a number of fine comedies (SONS OF THE DESERT, BONNIE SCOTLAND, THE FLYING DEUCES). but let's face it: their minimalist style is positively prosaic compared to the urbane chaos of The Marx Brothers and/or the graceful bombast Abbott & Costello.
Bud & Lou are occasionally accused, in conjunction with The Three Stooges, of glorifying violence. what people miss is that it's supposed to be an impulsive act of momentary frustration, never genuine animosity. Abbott & Costello, for all their internal trials and tribulations, still ultimately feel like genuine friends.
he admittedly hides it well, but the character played by Bud Abbott has a heart. it may seem as though Abbott just keeps Costello around to receive the business end of his temper and/or greed, but he always manages to dredge up loyalty and concern when push comes to shove. (consider ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN, where he states that they have to save Lou from Dracula. or RIDE 'EM COWBOY: circumstances have gotten Lou engaged to a less than appealling Indian squaw, but when the ""marriage"" finally takes place it turns out the ""bride"" was Abbott in disguise. or the running gag in which Bud is in tears thinking Lou has been killed, and Lou's reappearance prompts ""you doublecrosser!!"" and a good slap.) usually, ""nobody picks on my pal but me"" seems like the lamest cliche' in the book, but somehow Bud Abbott made it work.
and of course Lou, while seeming to be a complete innocent, manages to get the upper hand in a number of their routines, in the sense that we never stop rooting for his singularly endearing character. Lou's loveable ""everyman"" quality brings a unique dimension and unshakable dignity to the cliche' dumb-half-of-the-team character, bringing pathos as well as humor. you'll laugh at Stan Laurel, but you'll never EMPATHIZE with him in quite the same way.
in a way, it's what's known as The Dr. Watson Effect: in much the way the more ""normal"" Dr. Watson's loyalty and admiration makes the aloof character of Sherlock Holmes more accessible, Abbott somehow becomes likable simply because Costello is willing to put up with him. just as Watson sees past Sherlock's lack of social skills and disinclination to feel emotion if he can help it, Lou sees something in Bud that makes up for his more frequently displayed dark side, and we the audience see it as well, filtered through Costello.
and with that we finally get around to the product we're supposed to be pitching. there's a grand total of 28 films here, including a formerly ""lost"" little gem called IT AIN'T HAY. that may seem like a lot, and with some it would be a bit much, but Abbott & Costello's talent is such that the cornball ""never enough"" cliche' actually seems to fit. even their least impressive efforts still have something to offer.
take ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS, their first film appearance. because studio muckety-mucks still weren't quite sure if they merited their own contract, they decided to test run the team by shoehorning them into a film already in production. the film that results is just as awkward and uneven as logic dictates it should be, yet somehow it manages to engage and entertain. and why? the most readily apparent explanation would be that Abbott & Costello must've been a good luck charm.
the weakest and least satisfying film they did for Universal is easily LITTLE GIANT. this ill-advised departure from their usual formula is best described as a poor man's Frank Capra film. but if nothing else it showcases abilities they didn't often get a change to demonstrate: Abbott had a fine character actor in him, and while Costello's gift for pathos makes intermittent appearances in their more standard formula, you'd probably never guess that he could be a dramatic actor to the extent necessitated here. the finished product teeters precariously on the brink of maudlin sap, but there's still a few laughs to be had. (it features my very favorite of their burlesque bits, ""7 X 13 = 28."")
even what's usually termed their worst film, ABBOTT & COSTELLO GO TO MARS, has it's charms. it has as much good-natured fun with the sci-fi conventions of the time as SPACEBALLS and GALAXY QUEST would have with their own. the priceless pair of dimwitted escaped convicts who act as the team's evil twin(s) are in themselves worth the price of admission. obviously this film was so singled out because science-fiction was still largely written off as a less ""legitimate"" genre of storytelling, but it owes as much of it's unflattering reputation to simple misrepresentation: to this day the most frequent criticism is to point out that they actually go to Venus...without bothering to explain that first they go to New Orleans during Mardi Gras, where, based on everyone's bizarre costumes, they ASSUME they've landed on Mars. the title was a joke, not a flub.
but i daresay you'd rather hear about the highlights. their twin masterpieces - BUCK PRIVATES and ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN - are only the most obvious examples. other winners to look forward to include HOLD THAT GHOST, THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP, ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE KILLER: BORIS KARLOFF (easily their most underrated effort), WHO DONE IT?, IN THE NAVY, HIT THE ICE, RIDE 'EM COWBOY, IN SOCIETY, ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE INVISIBLE MAN, KEEP 'EM FLYING, THE NAUGHTY NINETIES (and NOT simply because it's the one film in which they performed ""Who's On First"" in it's entirety), BUCK PRIVATES COME HOME, ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE MUMMY, and most surprisingly, THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES. this latter tale of falsely accused Revolutionary War figures who's ghosts are cursed to haunt a mansion, was joint with LITTLE GIANT in deviating from their norm. but unlike LITTLE GIANT, it is a masterstroke which makes you almost regret their rigid adherence to formula from that point on. almost.
as a rule the films have the same basic weakness in their awkward attempts to ""balance"" Abbott & Costello with off-the-rack love story subplots - many of which feel like they're just going through the motions - and, as if that weren't bad enough, some of the dorkiest excuses for songs you'll ever hear in your life! (the '30s and '40s was a delightful era for movies radio drama, but alas, the Dark Ages for pop music.) this practice is what most dates these films, and more besides. more than one subsequent generation would refer to these as ""bathroom moments."" (interestingly, Groucho effectively predicts the phenomenon at such a point of The Marx Brothers' film HORSE FEATHERS: ""i'm stuck here, but there's no reason you folks can't go wait in the lobby 'til this blows over."")
this, you pretty much have to put down to the context of the times. inadvisable as more recent ""conventional wisdom"" would deem it, this something-for-everyone formula somehow worked for audiences in the throes and/or wake of The Great Depression. most likely it's because people need entertainment that much more in times of such crisis. and anyway, the question of ""staying power"" wouldn't of occurred to anyone involved. in an world with no television, let alone cable tv or home video, there'd be no reason to worry about how a given film would be taken in five or six months, much less five or six decades. posterity simply wasn't (yet) an issue. so about all you can do is keep reminding yourself that this was done because it was ""good for business"" at the time, not to inconvenience (and/or irritate) entire generations who hadn't even been born yet.
the major complaint from the critics toward Abbott & Costello was always over-emphasis on the time-honored burlesque sketches. and we do get quite of few of them repeated over the course of the set. but that okay, even more, that's right, because that was their strength. they honed these routines to faultlessness, and no one ever did them better. what's more, they preserved for posterity a wealth of comedic gold that might otherwise of been drowned without a trace in the Sands Of Time. and yes, that's where what turned out to be their signature piece came from.
""Who's On First,"" much like ""Stairway To Heaven,"" almost did a disservice to it's performers by becoming so legendary. they became so synonymous with it that there are times when Abbott & Costello seem to be construed as a one-hit wonder. but trust me, just as there's more to Led Zeppelin than ""Stairway To Heaven,"" there is more to Abbott & Costello than ""Who's On First."" buy the set and watch the movies, and see for yourself.",1369612800,5,8771,4.855807743658211

Most of these I saw 55-60 years ago, and most I have dis-remembered in the interim. Of course I remember ""Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein, Dracula and the Wolf Man."" I had forgotten that the Andrews Sisters were featured in several of their wartime movies, and that the classic ""Who's On First"" showed up more than once in their movies.

Their humor was light on the slapstick (though there was more than some), but depended largely on rapid-fire dialog and the ever-endearing and unschooled innocense of Lou Costello. In many ways the humor of Abbott & Costello presages that of Jerry Seinfield. A&C's movies were mostly about nothing. And darn funny for it!

3558394,5,B001EXE2Y2,This is a great item. We have wonderful youthful memories of watching these with my grandparents. We now have had hours of fun with my 7 year old granddaughter.  She was crazy about the Stooges (far too much slapstick violence) but Abbott & Costello is her new favorite comedy team.  She really enjoys the book that gives her a clear idea about what she is picking to watch next.  We have had great conversation about the movies and the similarities between A & C and the Stooges. She has even begun to notice similarities in casting and how stunts are done. It is good clean fun and a great educational and family bonding tool.,1347667200,,628,4.491228070175438

Finally one night when we were watching ""who's on first"" my grandfather became so irate that he flung his bottle of wild turkey through his tv screen because they wouldn't use the word whom.

They did release It Ain't Hay on DVD R as part of their Universal Vault Series, but the previous DVD 18 discs are garbage. So update your A & C collection with the DVD 9 discs and be happy. Just don't buy in to their talk when the films come out on Blu Ray. I've bought the VHS versions and the two sided DVD 18 version and now the complete collection.

His favorite is the ""Who's On First"" bit but he gets the humor in many of the others as well. There are many uncontrolled giggle fests while watching these movies. And there are many movies to enjoy here. Have fun with your family.",1332633600,,502,4.294736842105263

The movies are good quality and still enjoyable after all of these years. The set packaging is also good looking and very convenient.

It is funny to see how much of the terminology and slang has changed over the years since these movies were made.

Highly Recommended!

3558418,5,B001EXE2Y2,"I have had my eye on purchasing this collection for quite some time and a couple of weeks ago the price was just right and I immediately snatched it right up. I have been a huge Abbott and Costello fan since early childhood. I use to love watching their movies when they would play on a local TV station in the mornings and afternoons on the weekends. I especially loved it when Abbott and Costello would cross genres and face off against the various classic Universal monsters. This gem of a collection has the complete set of Universal pictures featuring the comedy duo that I grew up watching and even some that I have never seen before like ""One Night in the Tropics"" and a few others. I love the packaging the set is contained in along with the collectible booklet that is included with the set. A must have for any fan of this legendary team.
  The only Abbott and Costello film I have owned on DVD prior to purchasing this collection is ""Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"" which is of course included in this collection. I love that I was able to obtain their entire library of Universal films with this single purchase and I have been having a blast viewing the films contained therein. I only wish that they would have included a few more special features like the A&E biography for example produced the duo in 1996 or something especially made for this boxed set. The special features that are included like ""Abbott and Costello meet Jerry Seinfeld"" are great little gems.

EDIT: One thing I should note, is the soundtracks on some of the films are less than stellar, at least from what is heard on my Sony digital receiver. I actually had to fix the audio tracks and re-author some of the films. The audi tracks sound very scratchy; lots of pops, clicks and hiss. After repairing the tracks manually, the improvement was amazing. This is still a great set to own, especially for the price I paid. But be warned that you may notice some iffy audio tracks. So far I have repaired the first four films: One Night on the Tropics, Buck Privates (the worst so far), In The Navy (second worst) and Hold That Ghost. I'll post another update after I've reviewed some more DVDs.

In case anyone is wondering, I used Goldwave audio editor to clean up the tracks. After applying some compression and noise reduction filters, the sound is near perfect.",1291075200,3,1026,4.54054054054054

A friend has purchased this set. After bragging about it and making fun of me for purchasing the 4 volume set. I told him that its still not complete. I showed him the one's that they missed out on, which I have seperate on DVD and VHS, in my complete A&C DVD, VHS collection.

I will say they did do a good job on this set and at a good price (compared to the 4 set volume)and I have to give credit to Universal for this, but we still have not been given what we all want, a complete set of Abbott and Costello movies. Simple request, but stll very difficult for all the studio's to understand.

My opinion, WAIT. They will come out in the next few years, and digiatally remastered, you just watch. Until then I'm enjoying watching those not on my 4 volume set on VHS and single DVD's.

3558468,5,B001EXE2Y2,"This is the one I've been waiting for since the invention of the DVD.  Universal has finally provided a package worthy of the comedy team that saved the studio during their amazing run as box office champs.  While their film catalog is uneven, and many of the rushed productions don't are not on a par with the duo's talents, the overall body of work still stands the test of time.  The high point for film buffs and historians must be the genre blending ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein.""  The film works on multiple levels and marked a comeback of sorts for Bud & Lou while providing a bookend for the Universal monsters era of big screen chills.  Lon Chaney Jr. is particularly effective interacting with the boys and Bela Lugosi displays a surprising light touch in what is only his second (and final) appearance as the legendary vampire.  The film was one of the original choices for a preservation project undertaken by the American Film Institute and the Library of Congress and it frequently appears on critic's lists of all-time great movies.  My family watches it every Halloween and enjoys it every time.  There are other gems as well... ""Buck Privates,"" ""Hold That Ghost,"" ""Meet the Killer,"" and ""In the Navy"" are some of my other favorites.  The packaging is excellently designed and the small book included is filled with useful information.  Best of all, unlike previous releases, the discs are single sided.  To top it off, the long missing film, ""It Ain't Hay,"" that completes the Universal series, is included in the set... the first time it's been released finally freed from legal limbo.  The collection is a time capsule of a simpler time in film making and in American history, and the good news is that the team of Abbott & Costello are talented and funny in any era.  Without Bud & Lou it is likely that we would never have had ""Seinfeld.""  If you are strangers to the comic team supreme, this is the package to help you explore what you've been missing.",1262822400,8,1982,4.690751445086705
3558469,4,B001EXE2Y2,"I treated myself to this box set because I love Abbott and Costello and the price was amazingly low through Amazon.  Over the years and now recently, thanks to Youtube, I've been able to show my wife and kids the laugh riot that is Abbot and Costello.  Now, it's even better because we own the 28 movies and extras that comprise this box set.  We can sit down and enjoy a classic comedy like Buck Privates or Follow That Ghost any time we want.  Great bits and skits, and jokes.  The only thing I could do without (especially in the early movies) is the singing. The early movies typically have 3 to 4 songs.  I don't need to see Martha Raye or the Andrews Sisters or any of the other crooners.  They just slow the action/comedy down.  That's just my opinion.  Others may like the 1940's period/era songs.

If you enjoy Abbott and Costello movies, this is a must have.  I'm glad I took the plunge.  I'd also recommend getting Jack and The Beanstalk.  It's not included in the box set but it is very, very funny.",1262304000,2,1011,4.342245989304812

I know some of today's youth might not get the jokes and such but it is just simply genius and hillarious.

I orginally watched abbott and costello when I was a teenager in the 80's on WPIX TV out of NYC every Sunday morning/early afternoon.

3558484,5,B001EXE2Y2,"I love this set, this has all the A&C films from Universal + It Aint Hay. I thought the transfers were slightly better. I love the packaging & the DVD's are easier to get to. In the Volumes, for me I was yanking them out of the side of the outside sleeve, which was a hassle & could damage the sleeve. then you had to unfold inner sleeve to get to them. Plus 4 movies were on a disc.
With this treasure set, you just lift the lid, pull out the movies you want to see which are in a cool book like design and there you go. Open the book and there are 2 discs waiting to be watched. Less cumbersome. Plus it is 2 movies per disc which to me shows improved transfers. This also contains a very cool book about A & C
Going through every single title would take forever, but those that surf the web could easily find whats on this set ( if you don't own it) - it is every movie they did from Universal from One Night in the Tropics to A & C Meet the Mummy..
I love the packaging,design and all the A&C films..I am a huge fan so this was an easy pickup for me.
The co-stars that were in these pictures were also fantastic ranging from Dick Powell to Boris Karloff to the Andrews Sisters to even Tor Johnson...
I actually sold my Volumes before this was released so when it came out I had the money ready.
Worth every single penny. Abbott and Costello were a dynamic duo on the screen (certainly not off the screen at certain intervals of their career) and even their worst movies are better than a lot of these newer comedies...
I will take A&C over any Adam Sandler film, any Will Ferrell film, any Borat or Bruno , or any dumb teen comedy anytime anyday",1246492800,12,1649,4.092592592592593

3558492,4,B001EXE2Y2,"Without restating too much of what other reviewers have already said, This is the complete collection of all 28 Abbott and Costello movies filmed for and distributed by Universal Studios. (Please don't post comments about the 8 ""missing"" films. They're from other studios) And despite what some reviewers have said the picture quality is very good. What's the little less you say? First off the box that resembles a steamer trunk that the discs are encased is a little bit bigger than it needs to be. There's about an inch in front and an inch and a half behind of spacer. The book is  actually a thin softcover paperback, the same exact size as a disc cover. Only much thinner. It would have been nice if they opted for larger print and hardcover. Another minor concern is Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein. As mentioned by another reviewer, the Realart title card covers the animated opening sequence in place of Universal International Presents for about 3 seconds. This can be annoying, but it's not catastropic. The ending is also bothersome as the Realart ""The End"" card is abruptly inserted covering over Chick (Abbott) and Wilbur (Costello) swimming away. I recommend getting the single disc release of A & C Meet Frankenstein. Even though most of the same features appear in this set, with the single disc it's all in one place. The positive aspect is the discs are inserted on each side of the covers and not overlapping for the first six of the seven covers. The seventh cover holds three discs. One on the left and two overlapping on the right. The Bonus Features disc contains the same features as the Volume 4 Franchise Collection. I own the four volume franchise collection.

My children just laughed and giggled throughout the whole movie.  That is when I decided to search and find an Abbott and Costello collection.  I was lucky.  This was the first hit and I looked through it and I was sold.

All true Abbott and Costello fans, most likely, already have the studio's four previously released A&C collections in their DVD libraries.  So, why buy this one?

First, this 15-disc set includes all 28 movies that the comics made for Universal, including IT AIN'T HAY (1943) which, for unknown legal reasons, was not included in any of THE BEST OF ABBOTT AND COSTELLO sets.

Adapted from a story by Damon Runyon, IT AIN'T HAY is a fun movie, and contains such A&C routines as ""Mudder/Fodder"" and ""Betting Parlor"".

Second, unlike the earlier multi-problem, double-sided/double-layer discs in the BEST OF sets, these discs are single-sided with only 2 movies (rather than 4) per disc.  No problems here.

Finally, this set is handsomely packaged with a large box that not only contains the DVDs (including one devoted to Special Features) in seven separate cases, but also a 44-page book that has fascinating background information and trivia about the comedians and each of their movies.

From ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS (1940) and BUCK PRIVATES (1941) through THE NAUGHTY NINETIES (1945), which contains the ""Who's on First"" routine, to ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE MUMMY (1955), is there a better gift for the Abbott & Costello fan?

3558505,5,B001EXE2Y2,"Just a quick note about this set. I think all the other reviewers have already covered just about everything there is to say (good and bad) about this set. The one negative remark I keep seeing come up about this set again and again is that it is the only way to get ""It Aint Hay"" on dvd. As a result many people who already have the other movies feel they have to shell out $85 for this one movie. I purchased a dvd copy of both ""Hay"" and the other rare A&C film ""Meet Captain Kidd"" (which was the only film shot in color) from a private collector on ""i offer dot comm"" a few months ago for less than $10 each. So for those who want to see these films without shelling out the big bucks again do what I did and get them somewhere else. Look around on that site you'll find all the stuff that you probably ever wish was out on dvd in the stores from old movies to old tv shows to complete tv series!!",1226966400,5,900,3.977900552486188
3558506,3,B001EXE2Y2,"To the person who was asking about a change in the main-titles for ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein""; I can't say for certain (only because I didn't purchase this new DVD set and consequently haven't watched any of it), but it sounds to me like Universal used a re-issue print of the film this time around. If you had purchased either the single-disc DVD of the film or Volume 3 of the ""Franchise Collection"" you no doubt must have watched the bonus trailer for the film at least once...

If you looked carefully during the end of the trailer you would have seen the words, ""A Realart Re-Release"". This means that the trailer itself was for the re-issue version of the film; but I don't know for certain if ""Realart"" was a subsidiary of Universal Pictures or not. I suppose you could do a search on Wikpedia; but, more often than not that site has a lot of mis-information... I do know that Realart had re-issued a few of the classic Universal monster pictures, like ""Son of Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"".

I own 5 volumes from Universal's ""The Legacy Collection"" DVD series of their classic horror films and the re-issue trailer for ""Son of Dracula"" is on Disc 2 of the ""Dracula"" DVD set. I also remember seeing a print of ""Buck Privates"" on TV that had the ""Realart"" logo on the main-title cards; so that obviously was a re-issue print as well.

You should also bear in mind that when Universal had that tragic fire back in June a large number of their digital and analog video masters (as well as all of their distribution/rental prints) reportedly went up in flames. Fortunately, the original film negatives to all of their old movies were apparently stored safely away from the Main Lot; but the downside is that it will be far too expensive to strike new distribution/rental prints from those negatives. Not only were most of Universal's classic film library affected, but also that of all the Paramount films made before 1948 (which were purchased by MCA/Universal in the 1950's).

I'm only guessing here, but it could very well be that Universal decided to use a re-issue print of ""A&C Meet Frankenstein"" because the video master used for the older DVD editions was either unavailable or had been destroyed. Consequently it may have been too expensive to create a new digital master from the original film negative.

Again, since I didn't purchase this set and haven't watched any of it, I have no idea what source material was used in the digital remastering for each of the individual films. My guess is that for most of the films in the set they may have used surviving digital masters that were done for the earlier DVD sets. Also, ""It Ain't Hay"" was released previously on VHS (used copies are probably still circulating on Amazon) so they might have been able to use the video master for that film if it survived the flames. If not, maybe they found an archival print over at UCLA.

I already own Volumes 1-3 of the ""Franchise Collection"" and haven't experienced any playback problems with any of them. I also have ""A&C Meet Frankenstein"" on the older, single DVD, just because I still wanted to have the audio commentary for the film and the ""Meet the Monsters"" bonus feature as well.

I didn't get Volume 4 because two of the three movies on that set (""A&C Meet Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" and ""A&C Meet the Keystone Cops"") are not very good. Also the compilation film, ""The World of Abbott and Costello"" is in my opinion a complete waste of time... I decided to purchase ""A&C Meet the Mummy"" seperately as well, because I feel it was the best one of the three. I wasn't crazy about ""It Ain't Hay"" when I saw it on TV years ago, so I don't mind not having it. I do have most of the ""Non-Universal"" stuff (with the exception of ""A&C Meet Captain Kidd"" and ""Rio Rita"" which still haven't been released to DVD).",1226448000,19,3841,4.582241630276565
3558507,4,B001EXE2Y2,"For Abbott and Costello fanatics, this is a great collection of the 28 movies the team made for their home studio, Universal. That said, however, there are some important factors (at least they're important to me) that prevent me from giving this set a full five-star rating.

First of all, I have to agree with all of you who feel disrespected by Universal's lack of marketing etiquette. It's bad enough that many devoted A&C fans who purchased those previous Franchise Collection volumes now feel like fools for loyally supporting those releases, but they can't even obtain the previously unavailable IT AIN'T HAY (1943) without having to purchase the other 27 movies all over again. Universal certainly hasn't shown any reluctance in re-releasing the same basic material over and over again (the 75th Anniversary Edition of DRACULA, the 75th Anniversary Edition of FRANKENSTEIN, etc.), so why not release a separate, single-disc edition of IT AIN'T HAY? Or a smaller 3-disc, 6-film set, like the one Universal released in the UK (which contained ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS, BUCK PRIVATES, PARDON MY SARONG, WHO DONE IT?, IN SOCIETY, and HERE COME THE CO-EDS). Given the choice of purchasing this new collection or purchasing IT AIN'T HAY by itself, I would have still purchased this new collection. But I still sympathize with consumers who don't want to or can't drop 84 bucks (or more) just to obtain one new title. Universal, you've done these good folks wrong...you should have provided them with an option. (Besides, as rare as it might be, IT AIN'T HAY is perhaps the weakest of the early A&C comedies.)

And if Universal went to the trouble of revamping this collection, why weren't more theatrical trailers included? Granted, there are a couple additional trailers this time around, but nowhere near as many as there should be. With the exception of AFRICA SCREAMS (United Artists, 1949), original-issue or re-release trailers for every Abbott and Costello feature exist in studio or private archives, or in the hands of private collectors. So what was the problem? Indifference or laziness? And if trailers weren't available for whatever reason, why not toss in a random episode of THE COLGATE COMEDY HOUR or a couple of those antique Castle Films abridgements (HAVE BADGE, WILL CHASE; NO INDIANS, PLEASE; RIOT ON ICE, etc.)? Please, give us something...ANYTHING that will help justify purchasing the bulk of these movies all over again. If this were a thirty-dollar set, this sort of grumbling would be trivial. But for this kind of money (and figuring in the cost of those previous volumes to boot), I believe this complaint is valid.

And where did those reissue titles come from? When ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS was first released on VHS, I was one of many A&C fans who applauded Universal for making the effort to track down a copy of the full-length, original-release version (as opposed to the edited reissue version that aired on television for years). But the DVD release of TROPICS is taken from a print that has a replaced opening-cast title and End title, unlike the original titles seen in the VHS format. Also, this new collection contains a Realart Pictures reissue print of ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. This is the best-quality version of this title that has ever been made available, though purists may grumble about the replaced footage. (If you're not familiar with the Realart version, it replaces the original ""Universal-International presents"" and ""The End"" titles, which obliterates some of the opening-credits animation and cuts short the final shot of Bud and Lou jumping into the water.)

If you didn't purchase any of the previous volumes, then now's the time to order this set. For the rest of us, it's yet another instance where the consumer has to grin and bear it.",1226275200,136,3813,4.990566037735849
3558508,5,B001EXE2Y2,"I say that with a grain of thought... having already bought all 4 ""Franchise Collections"" which we all know was issued first.

I then bought the Vol. 1 thru Vol. 4 as they were released (which forced me to re-buy movies I already owned).  Now they release a complete set which has like an extra movie or two.  How many times will they go back to the well?

If they release a Volume 5 with the remaining content it won't be so bad but I doubt that they will which means I already bought the last DVD from Universal I will ever buy.  I guess if the studio can't put out NEW quality movies, they have to rely on re-releasing OLD quality movies.",1225324800,17,582,4.0701754385964914

3558515,5,B001EXE2Y2,"A  lot of people who are trashing Universal about this excellent release simply don't know what they're talking about:

1.) For starters, you have to know that when Universal originally released their other 4 volumes of Abbott & Costello on DVD, the movie IT AIN'T HAY was unable to be included due to  rights issues and so it was not able to be included. Now this problem has been rectified.

2.) At the time of the other 4 Volumes of A&C, Universal was foolishly trying out a double-sided DVD technology called ""DVD-18"". As a result, many people who bought the old DVDs complained of all sorts of random issues like skipping and picture freezing. So if there is ever a bone to pick with Universal, it was because they were experimenting with those earlier DVD-18s. This NEW SET is much more reliable and durable, since it's going to be issued in tried-and-true ""DVD-9"" single-sided format, which is much better quality all around.

3.) Somebody complained that there were several movies missing from this collection.  No, there are NOT any UNIVERSAL features missing here. The titles he's thinking of are films that were RELEASD BY OTHER STUDIOS, (SUCH AS MGM). This box set is purely all of Abbott and Costello's UNIVERSAL films.

Well, that's it for now. It may be a pain in the neck for some to double-dip, but at least Universal has corrected the earlier double-sided disc catastrophe (they probably meant well with the old sets, but it turned out to be a faulty technonogy). And now they've cleared the rights to IT AIN'T HAY, where they couldn't release it previously. And to their credit they've compensated fans by adding MORE NEW EXTRA FEATURES to this set.

If there's one thing Universal could do right by the fans who feel they're being ""gypped"", they might consider releasing IT AIN'T HAY separately at a later date, as a ""stand-alone"" purchase for those buyers who choose to stubbornly hang onto their inferior double-sided DVD-18 volumes.
