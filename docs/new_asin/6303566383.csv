7850197,5,6303566383,"""When in another's Lair, show him respect or else do not go there."" - 3rd Satanic Rule of The Earth, Anton LaVey.

A charming tale of a Warlock & Witch residing in an enchanting Victorian Manse in the wilderness, who receive several uninvited guests one dark and stormy night - the ""longest night in the world""... consisting of two despicable parents of a precious little girl named ""Judy""; and accompanied by two obnoxious English punker girls is a well-meaning man named 'Ralph' who struggles with his eternal dreamchild within. The gracious and polished hosts, Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke, also happen to be doll-makers, and their house is filled with these creations, who like Galatea, contain a life of their own infused by their regal father's Magical hands.

During the course of the evening, the actions of the guests are either rewarded or punished according to their deeds - the first to receive justified correction is one of the rotten punk girls after deeming to rob the place of some its valuables -and the dolls take their due; then later her friend receives lethal castigation at the end of a firing squad of tin soldiers.

Little Judy suffers maltreatement at the hands of her step-mother since the start, when she actually threw her cherished teddy bear into the bushes outside in the storm - so kind Gabriel grants her a new companion in ""Mr. Punch"" - a jester with a hell of an attitude if roused by antagonistic organisms like Mr. Bower, Judy's father who along with stepmother 'Rosemary', treat Judy like irritating property instead of a daughter. One memorably poignant statement made by Mr. Hartwicke was ""Being a parent is a priveledge, not just a right.""

Poor confused Ralph is accused by the other guests of murder and perversion, but the man just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and is rather oblivious to some of the circumstaces surrounding him, and eventually has to defend himself against the brutish attacks of Bower, but the dolls protect their own. Earlier, Ralph had a run-in with the dolls who despite his rude behavior, decide that he is a child at heart, and should therefore be spared the fate of the other guests. Judy gains a probable worthy father, and her mother, a potential husband.

This film actually does assert the quotes at the beginning and end of this review quite nicely.

In the end, it is seen that those who visit the house can either appreciate the hospitality and are wished well on their way, or remain a permanent part of 'the collection'.

""If a guest in your Lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy."" - 4th Satanic Rule of The Earth, Anton LaVey.

{This film conjures memories of My paternal Grandmother of Spanish/Italian noble stock, who has a collection of ceramic and porcelain dolls which she brought from the old country, whom one could have sworn moved at times, or blinked, or even demonstrated subtle changes of expression.}",1152230400,,2931,4.801587301587301
7850198,5,6303566383,"Modern b-horror maestro, Stuart Gordon [Re-Animator, Castle Freak, From Beyond, King of the Ants] takes a break from his usual violence, gore, and sex driven horror fare to spin a cautionary tale of what can happen when you grow up and lose the love in your heart.  The story begins as a young girl with an overactive imagination, named Judy, along with her father and wicked witch stepmother, get stuck on an old country road during a terrible storm and are forced to spend the night in an old gothic manor with it's two old and very eccentric owners.  A few more people show who were also caught in the storm to spend the night.  What ensues is a long night of terror as it turns out that the owners of the old creepy house are dollmakers that specialize in handcrafting their toys the old fashioned way...by trapping and killing humans and turning them into pint-sized psychotic puppets.  Dolls came before Childs Play and the Puppet Master movies [although Charles and Richard Band who helped with Dolls, would go on to work with the Puppet Master series] and is a worthy addition to the killer toy horror sub-genre.  It's just a shame that not more people have seen it.  Dolls boasts some of the best and smoothest stop motion animation sequences I have ever seen, a lively cast, gothic storytelling and atmosphere, and awesome Tales From the Crypt-esque ending, and a child-like innocence that horror movies seem to lack nowadays.",1119916800,3,1436,4.724
7850199,5,6303566383,One of my favorite low budet movies of the 1980s. Work on by  Charles Band  before he went on to start up the Full Moon video company it is a shame the sequal talk about in 1990s never came about or that Charles never aquired this title for his DVD release company. The plot is simple one about a group of strangers than break down before an old house on a stormy night. The twist in this horror classic is the house is own by an old couple who has brought there doll collection to life. The dolls judge people for childhood innocence and if you fail the test you start over as a doll yourself.,1085356800,,594,4.112068965517241
7850200,4,6303566383,"UPDATE FEBRUARY 13, 2018: I no longer watch horror films and do not endorse this film, this is just an old review.

ORIGINAL OCT 18, 2003 REVIEW:  Certainly not perfect or profound or classic cinema, but as far as horror films go ""The Dolls"" is done quite well, especially for a ""B"" movie, it has some fun creative kills, and a great twist.

 PLOT:
 We get the whole cliched ""Dark and stormy night"" scenario here. As people get stuck in the mud one after another, and have to take solace at the only house around, a big and old, somewhat creep mantion. The kind old married couple offer them to stay the night. Well of course they do because a. of there didn't there would be no movie. And b. If they didn't they would have to either sleep in their cars or mud.  :D There is more to the house and couple in the house then meets the eye, and  we get many murders, and believe it or not there is actually decent reasoning behind the murders!

 ACTING:
 The acting really isn't that bad for a B movie. Maybe some of it could've been better, but all in all I think its pretty good. especially the old couple. They scared the heck out of me.

 ATMOSPHERE: The Atmosphere is very creepy . Its kind of surrealistic and gives a somewhat disjointed feeling.

 KILLINGS: The killings are done quite well, all by dolls of course. They are very graphic, and other then the lower quality acting I probably like this better then Child's Play as far as Dolls killing people go's. Its quite a bit creepier, and has better atmosphere.

 One of the better lesser-known horror films, this is a film that should definitely have the status of a cult classic, and one I wouldn't mind seeing remade, though it could be easily messed up for sure, it would have to be remade with a knowing wink.

7850201,3,6303566383,"""Dolls"" is an average film for the 1980's drive-in fans. It delivers some thrills and chills, the special effects are pretty decent and the music is creepy. The only thing that wasn't done to my satisfication was the performances from the actors and actresses. That lowered my rating for this quite a bit. This is an overall good film, with just one thing missing: high quality performances from actors that I've seen perform very well in other movies.",1059523200,,452,4.8076923076923075
7850202,5,6303566383,"One of my favorite horror movies from the 80's. i have seen this over 10 times and i could watch it again. i wonder why they never made a sequel to this overlooked gem and kept on making those terrible puppet master movies. actually the first three were decent, after that they shouldve stopped!
Dolls is about a group of strangers a husband, daughter, step-mom, two hoods and a gentleman stayingat a mansion for one rainy night. the keepers of the house are two dollmakers who are really witches. these two make killer dolls and only alucky few will survive the night. the special effects i thought were great for the time. the acting direction and music were good too. it was a tad bit short but i am not complaining. The director stuart gordon needs to make more movies like this. it is a creepy movie but also has a kid at heart touch to it. if you can get your hands on this gem get it!",1058572800,,891,4.309523809523809
7850203,5,6303566383,"I bought this on Ebay after seeing it on the Sci-Fi channel and from what I had seen in the movie was great action packed fun.
Incase you didn't know Guy Rolfe plays a""caretaker""with his band of little Dolls but when stranges barge in on him to spend the night he gladdly says yes but what the visitors don't know is that this place is haunted by the little Demonic Dolls!
Who will survive the night???
This movie is one of the best horror movies from the 80's.
I highly recommend this if you want to be scared and want to be swept away into an Horror-Adventure world of killer toys.
I ALSO RECOMMEND PUPPET MASTER 1, 2, 3, 4,and 7 if you want to be scared. ALSO SEE DEMONIC TOYS AND DOLLMAN.
THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!",1013558400,,715,4.188405797101449
7850204,5,6303566383,"This is a great horror movie, filled with classic acting. Of course it's not the best movie around. But I thought it was pretty good. I think you would have to at least watch it twice to understand it, and get a good perspective on it.
The cast tried their best and I think their performance was unique. Also alot of people feel this movie is a cheap rip off of Child's Play. But the this movie came out two years before Child's Play. The setting for the movie is really good too. And even the dolls themselves were very cool looking. Not fake at all. Though at the end when you see Punch the doll come alive and attack David, you can see the strings on him moving. You have to look closely though, otherwise the scene goes by too fast.
Stephen Lee played Ralph, the child at heart. Perfect character for this movie. Stephen Lee put on a great performance! This movie is a must see!",1009584000,,882,4.255952380952381
