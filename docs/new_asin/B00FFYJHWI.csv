8615439,3,B00FFYJHWI,"This is an outdoor production.  It is set to be a great spectacle, with big fluorescent lights, fireworks and a quite big stage.  From the reviews written in Australia, I gather that as a spectacle it was a success.  The problem is that for a Blue-Ray to be watched on your TV, it looses most of that big stage appeal.  The microphones used by the singers are quite disturbing when you take close-up shots.  In addition, the sound doesnt have the depth I am accustomed in other recordings.  Creating the right sound for the audience is always a challenge in an open area, but it certainly doesnt work in a recording.  There are some interesting aspects of the production, which doesnt include the spoken dialogues of the original Carmen.  For this type of staging, it seems like an intelligent decision, it is very difficult to create intimate scenes in such a big and open stage, so avoiding dialogue makes sense.  The choreography works very nice for big scenes with plenty of people on stage, but it is not very effective otherwise.  The singers and the orchestra are good, although not incredible, and that may be in part due to the limitations of the stage and the sound system.  There are better Carmen Blue-Rays than this one, although if you watched it life, this may be a good souvenir and reminder of what you saw and heard.",1398297600,6,1334,4.610169491525424
