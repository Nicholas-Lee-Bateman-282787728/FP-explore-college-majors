8545627,5,B009Z94JFE,"I am really glad I didn't take some of the negative reviews seriously here.  Several Hip fans had recommended this so I pulled the trigger and on a Friday night with the house empty I put the disc in and turned it up.  Obviously I am a huge fan of the band, but unlike others I never was able to see them live or interact with any of their fans.  So the format of band footage getting prepared interspersed with fans telling their stories was really interesting.  I liked the behind the scenes stuff with the promoters and townspeople, noting that only one person (a very whiny and annoying bar owner) was against the show with everyone else thrilled about it.  The concert footage is outstanding and while sure, I would love to have seen more of the concert we did get 7 songs, maybe more and that was enough.  This isn't a true concert film.  It is more about the Hip's relationship with the country, this town and its fans.

I highly recommend this.  It comes with both blu-ray and a DVD but I haven't checked the DVD to see if there is anything else besides the film. Perhaps I will later.",1485561600,,1093,4.344827586206897
8545628,1,B009Z94JFE,"I'm sorry, this movie sucks.  And I love the Hip.  Seen them 5 times over the years here in Minneapolis. The set came with two DVDs, one blu ray and the others standard I guess.  Why couldn't the second DVD be the actual concert?  Thats what a true fan wants to see, the show.  The stories that these really super big Hip fans are fine, but I wanted the concert too.  One Night In Toronto is much, much better.  Great show and I loved that it was uncut from beginning to the end just as if you were there.",1480204800,2,505,4.040404040404041
8545629,1,B009Z94JFE,"this is a waste of money, a feature length video of fans talking about the band. As always the guys played great but Gord's singing was off, more like shouting",1436832000,,159,4.333333333333333
8545630,5,B009Z94JFE,A must for any Hip fan.  Great footage.  Also great for music fan in general,1431734400,2,76,4.0
8545631,4,B009Z94JFE,"I've been a huge HIP fan for years, the only thing is they spend way too much time interviewing almost everyone in Canada on how much they like the HIP, other than that, the live performances are typically great HIP.",1428364800,,216,4.425
8545632,5,B009Z94JFE,"I am still shocked that The Tragically Hip are unknown in the US--though they are HUGE in Canada. I use this wonderful, quirky movie to introduce the band to my friends.  The segments with the fans are interesting once--then it is a simple matter of clicking next to go from song to song in this wonderful concert film.  For Hip fanatics, it is a must. Great to see the guys preparing and performing. I really wish they would release the concert as a live album. Can't get enough of those guys.

8545633,4,B009Z94JFE,Not great but Hip fans will love it.  Live versions of Bobcaygeon and Fifty Mission Cap are worth the price.,1362268800,2,108,4.4
