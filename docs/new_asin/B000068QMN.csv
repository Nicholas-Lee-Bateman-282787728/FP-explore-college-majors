7964579,5,B000068QMN,"Sad that so many people rated this as one star since in fact the chronicles are interesting and well done. Why the studio decided to release this on a separate DVD when it is all ready on most Ray Harryhausen DVD movies released is odd. Suffice it to say the chronicles are well worth seeing. If you want them just buy a great Harryhausen movie like ""Jason and the Argonauts"" or ""Mysterious Island"" on DVD.",1044057600,10,406,4.426666666666667
7964580,3,B000068QMN,"""THE HARRYHAUSEN CHRONICLES"" focuses on the art of Ray Harryhausen.  This affectionate and classy documentary is a perfect companion title to the feature ""20 Million Miles to Earth.""  Narrated by Leonard Nimoy and written, produced and directed by Richard Schickel, Time magazine's film critic and film historian, this entertaining celebration of Harryhausen's singular cinematic legacy features numerous film clips and observations by George Lucas and others whose lives were impacted by his films.  Harryhausen says the ""essence of fantasy is the transfer of reality into the imagination.""  Certainly his remarkable stop-motion sequences have entertained generations and haunted memories.  Schickel says it best with an observation spoken by Nimoy: ""In this moment of mechanized imagination, this unforgettable work recalls for us the value of the open and wondering eye and the informed and compassionate heart.""",1026172800,12,915,5.798507462686567
7964581,1,B000068QMN,"This excellent documentary is already available on the DVDs ""7th Voyage of Sinbad"", ""First men on the Moon"", and several other DVD releases. I can't imagine that the ""creatures gallery"" could justify a purchase of this, even for die-hard model-building fans.",1023840000,18,258,5.317073170731708
