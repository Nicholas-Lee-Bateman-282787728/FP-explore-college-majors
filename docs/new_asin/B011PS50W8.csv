7339954,3,B011PS50W8,"Creature with the Atom Brain, 1954 film

A man drives a Ford to a house. He delivers a satchel with $20,000 to Hennessey, a good take. Then a man crashes into the window to kill him! Others break in and shoot at him, but he keeps on going. ""Drive home."" The first one is eliminated, there are others. The two men dress in protective gear to enter a laboratory. ""Different parts of the bodies die at different times. The brain is the first to go."" The police arrive to investigate. ""The killer had enormous strength."" His fingerprints are luminous! The scientists said the blood had crystalline substances but no hemoglobin. It is highly radioactive too! This creature can't be killed with bullets. ""I don't believe it."" The fingerprints identify the perpetrator: he died weeks ago in prison! Next DA McGraw is killed in his garage. What is the connection? How could the dead come back to life? Michael Faraday showed how dead frog legs could move. Nowadays it could be radioactive forces.

""Why did it happen in my administration?"" asks one official. The newspaper reports two dead men walk the streets. Daughter Penny can't read the comics or watch TV. Uncle Dave found out when McGraw and Hennessy worked together to convict Buchanan. The Captain warns the others that Buchanan may be back and they must be on guard. Buchanan has disappeared along with his German doctor Steig. [Note the old TV set.] A truck with a detector on its roof passes by, a man leaves by the back door. Wilhelm Steig did research on the amygdala of the brain. A truck with a detector passes by, a man leaves by the back door. Wilhelm Steig did research on the amygdala. Could this be applied to humans? Buchanan directs Steig to his next task. The Police Chief is asked to stop the search, or else.

There are many accidents in trains, planes, and vehicles on the roads and highways! The Governor declares a state of emergency. ""Carry your papers when you travel"" is the advice for the people. Captain Harris becomes a victim and test subject! Penny opens the door for Uncle Dave (his hand is cold). Capt. Davis visits the two men kept hidden in jail. There is an APB on Harris when the bodies are found. Harris is taken to a hospital for an examination. [You can guess how this story will end.]

This is an interesting story that combines a murder mystery (the search for a killer) with a horror story of a new man-made monster (like Dr. Victor Frankenstein's creation) and the novel feature of atomic radiation. This story uses atomic radiation as a power source. But atomic radiation only kills, it doesn't create life Was it meant to symbolize the dangers from atomic bombs?",1382572800,2,2656,4.656716417910448

7339964,5,B011PS50W8,"I saw this when I was a little kid so it has sentimental value for me.  It also has good shots of downtown LA circa 1955 (I believe it shows the Federal Court House at 312 North Spring Street from Main Street--that is the back of it) so I might like this better than some millennial.  To be critical the science the movie tries to rely on DOES NOT COMPUTE and younger viewers might find it a little corny.

I may be mistaken on this but I believe the actor who plays the police captain (who later has his brain removed) also played the judge several times on Perry Mason episodes.",1470268800,4,580,4.207207207207207

7339971,5,B011PS50W8,This is a real find. I love it. Richard Denning is wonderful. The plot is interesting and it is full of campy moments. The scene when the cop who has been turned into a zombie tears apart a doll is alone worth the cost of the DVD. This one's a keeper.,1457481600,8,251,3.9411764705882355
7339972,3,B011PS50W8,"This is one of those films that appeared regularly during ""Science Fiction Week"" on channel 10 in Philadelphia during the sixties.  Though hardly a classic, it is one of those films that contains a scene that, at least for me for some unknown reason, I've always remembered:  The off-duty cop, having unknowingly passed his zombie replacement guard, turning and running back into the house, followed seconds later by a scream with the
camera focused only on the empty doorway.  A perfect example of less being way more.",1452643200,3,519,4.942528735632184

7339974,4,B011PS50W8,"""Creature With The Atom Brain"" is a largely overlooked sci-fi classic from 1955 starring Richard Denning, who is perhaps best remembered for ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"". The film plays like a film noir thriller initially as a mobster is killed in his office. The complications start when the police discover the murderer has been dead for almost a month. The film then veers off firmly into science fiction territory as the police discover that not only is there radiation at every crime scene, there are multiple recently deceased bodies missing from the morgue. Could there be a criminal revenge thuggery angle involving zombies, mobsters, and an evil German scientist? Of course there could: this is a Sam Katzman film, after all!

The movie is briskly paced and is interesting if not entirely convincing (nobody is bothered by gigantic forehead incisions?) The acting ranges from quite decent to tolerable, and while the characters are really more caricature than anything, it's a fun throwback to the golden days of sci-fi, when techno-talk was hilarious, the science was absurd, and the plots were predictable. If you're interested in the genre, this is worth checking out.",1449014400,8,1184,5.134715025906735

What's more, Walker discovers radiation at the crime scenes! Has someone created an army of radioactive, killer zombies? If so, who? Why? Soon, disaster and mayhem ensue!

So the movie is basically a budget NCIS or CSI episode with the murders apparently being controlled by atomic energy.
I've watched all of my vintage Sci-Fi collections numerous times.....probably much more.
