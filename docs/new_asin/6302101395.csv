428303,5,6302101395,"All I can say is wow. I was blown away. This truly, is a great man. Ross Perot is a genious. I would have voted for him if I could. This really is Straight talking. ""Now, I know the question your going to ask me that you haven't yet. And that is 'Can you govern?' COMPARED TO WHOM! (The interviewer denied Ross Perot the dramatic silence effect) Compared to whom! Compared to whom."" Well compared to a great man like Ross Perot. If you want to know anything, see this treasure. If you want to know about business (If your wife can't trust you, how can I?) If you want to know about what other people think of him (sSomeone wrote an unflattering review of him and he said it doesn't matter because he didn't personally know him even though he is running for president) or if you just want to know the meaning of life it's all here!",1018569600,2,830,4.226415094339623
428304,5,6302101395,"This is really an excellent portrayel of a common office worker and her mission to be one in a million and it worked. Dolly definetly got my vote in ""Straight Talk"". Her actressing was flawless, she could really walk the walk. James Woods does an Oscar-worthy acting job in a funny, lighthearted movie that is one of my favorites. I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",981072000,3,362,4.761904761904762
428305,5,6302101395,This is one of dollys best movies yet. She is grate acting as her charictor and I think that is because this is her charictore I mean thats who she really is. This is a must see movie you will enjoy it.,954633600,,202,3.8333333333333335
428306,2,6302101395,"Not Dolly's best and definitely not James Woods' best, who obviously needed some extra cash at the time.  The pairing of Dolly and Woods makes no sense - it's hard enough to believe that they simultaneously act - but in the same movie?  Also not to sound perverted but Dolly's characters are always the same - the cocky, wisecracking, yet down home and innocent cowgirl played out long ago. Straight Talk, unfortunately offers little laughs.",953942400,3,441,4.866666666666666
428307,4,6302101395,"Dolly Parton is utterly delightful in this corny, syrupy but immensebly enjoyable comedy. Her unlikely romance with James Woods is actually quite interesting as it is easy to see how Dolly's charm could permiate even the  most jaded people. Sure it's not very original and it is very lightweight  but it's got an old fashioned Frank Capra kind of sweetness to it.",949363200,8,363,4.838709677419355

428940,4,6302101395,"You might think that the great acting that elevates this is the award-winning actor James Woods, as he does in some other films, but not in this case.  I am not a fan of Dolly Parton, and I dislike her music (which, unfortunately, features prominently in the soundtrack of this film), but she is the one whose acting takes this standard fare and makes it something worth watching.  She is not only believable in her performance, she is also charming and delightful.  I almost did not buy it because Dolly Parton is in the film, but she is what makes it worth watching.

It really makes me wish she had spent her time acting instead of singing, and been given good roles in good films, as she really is special in this film.

The BD (Blu-ray) on Mill Creek Entertainment has no extras, but is competently put on the disc, so there are no complaints.",1411862400,,848,4.445161290322581

However, her life experience and compassion for others compels her to answer the questions, ultimately assuming the life of ""Dr. Shirley.""

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Coming off a successful string of hits including [`9 to 5' and `Steel Magnolias] Dolly Parton took a chance with `Straight Talk,' as she hadn't carried a film which was designed to be more of a mainstream romance. Luckily she once again found herself gifted with talented co-stars who helped share the burden. Dolly Parton was fortunate enough to work with the always engaging James Woods and Griffin Dunne.

`Straight Talk' is definitely a product of its time. In today's culture of oversaturation, one area that's definitely not exempt is talk shows. People are famous simply for being famous and everyone blogs ad nauseam about their days. Thus a film that combines talk shows and mistaken identities simply wouldn't fly. Not only that but we love nothing more than to see our heroes fall off their pedestals. Any movie made today which even attempted to tackle similar subject matter would need to include the main character being humiliated. And what really dates the film is the key plot point: Dolly Parton being mistaken for a doctor, which our society long ago gave up demanding as criteria for talk show hosts.

The fact that `Straight Talk' is so obviously a 1990s film is one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. It has a definite re-watchable factor that ties directly to when it was made. For all that the movie rests on a case of mistaken identity, it's still an amazingly straightforward story, one with lessons which bear repeating and continue to surface in other films. While a film like `Runaway Bride' which offers up the same morals, meaning be true to yourself, sometimes a fresh start is the best ending there is, and love will find a way which may have made a lot more money, I love watching `Straight Talk' due entirely to its performances.

Dolly Parton carries this film, eminently believable as a small town woman who likes to forget her own problems by listening to others. She is evenly matched with James Woods, who offers a performance the tone of which I've never seen him, duplicate. Outside of Hades in Disney's Hercules, this may be my favourite of his roles. Through facial expressions alone, he's able to portray the genuine struggle his character goes through when he finds himself falling for the subject of his investigation. However, even the bit parts are cast well; from a cameo by Teri Hatcher [Desperate Housewives] to a small supporting role by Jerry Orbach [Law and Order]. No one chews scenery or acts above what their character calls for. Thus the script is allowed the best chance to duplicate the screenwriter's original vision.

And while some may complain that Straight Talk is merely a vehicle for Dolly Parton's songs and 10 of which appear in the film and on the soundtrack and I didn't find their placement too be jarring or that this was a step away from a musical. Let's face it; Dolly Parton is always going to be known as a singer, who we love to bits, and the fact that she wrote the songs specifically for the film, helps make their additions more cohesive. Plus, they blended so well with Brad Fiedel's film score.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `Straight Talk' comes to Blu-ray with a very nice 1080p encoded video presentation. This is another brilliant licensed release from Mill Creek Entertainment, especially as the film looks quite good in high-definition. The clarity and improvement is obvious, there is definitely no confusing it for standard-definition. Even weaker looking moments still feature a notable level in improvement. Colours are pleasing and black levels remain solid throughout. Detail isn't always the sharpest, but it is definitely easy to appreciate in the majority of the scenes. The film isn't visually stunning, but it certainly doesn't look bad either. Overall I think this is a respectable transfer that will at least please fans of the film. I've never seen the film look better, so I don't know how much better it could look than this. Overall I think Mill Creek Entertainment a very fine good job with the transfer, with no serious issues to report.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  A 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio track is included, but the printed information on the back cover lists the release with a 2.0 Dolby Digital audio, but rest assured that it was simply a mistake. Like with other titles in the Mill Creek Entertainment catalogue, no subtitle options are included. While 2.0 audio isn't exactly something to get excited about, I am very appreciative that Mill Creek Entertainment managed to include a high-definition audio track. The film relies very little on surround sound effects, so I wasn't too upset when a 5.1 mix was not included, but it would have been nice if they had included it. Dialogue is of highest priority in the film and sounds quite clear throughout. The film's music also has some nice clarity throughout. Audio effects from the film manage to satisfy, though nothing special. Overall this is a very solid mix, which I don't think could sound much better.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Sadly there is no extras have been included, which is a great shame, as I am sure there was some behind-the-scene outtakes available or even interviews with some of the cast.

Finally, `Straight Talk' earns a solid Blu-ray release from Mill Creek Entertainment. The video and audio presentations are certainly satisfying, and at times impressive. Overall this Blu-ray release is well ""worth a look"" to any fan of this film and of course the brilliant Dolly Parton. The pricing on the release is totally fantastic value. While studios won't be remaking `Straight Talk' anytime soon, this feel-good film doesn't rely on anything flashy, but it rides on the talents of its cast and at a bargain basement price, you would grin a lot from this wonderful film and it has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

429380,2,6302101395,"This low brow Dolly Parton romantic comedy pits her as an annoyingly honest yet witty and street smart high school dropout that has a knack for giving ""straight talk"" advice who moves away from her lazy boyfriend (played by actor Michael Madson in his quest for a much needed paycheck) in a small town to head for a better career and life in Chicago. Once there she ""accidentally"" becomes put on as a talk radio show host as someone who gives advice to callers with problems, by a newsroom that thinks she's a doctor who was supposed to be starting that day but conveniently did not show up. So they suppose she's the doctor. Such luck for just stepping into a different room to get a cup of coffee. Oh, but the cheesy far-fetched cliches don't end there. Yup, you can guess what happens - the people love her, the radio execs recruit her.

In enters James Woods (who looks and acts terribly as a news reporter who's so uncomfortably creepy to watch as a romantic ""lead"" you understand why he's never played that role since) as the 'love interest' who just happens to always be at the right place at the right time, and proceeds to court Dolly Parton, or Dr. Shellie Kenyan (can I just insert how ridiculous the name sounds please) so that he can get story to seek out the ""dirt"" on her and expose her to the world (she's not a doctor, she's not educated, etc) but then predictably falls for her, then must decide between his career and her. ....He picks her. ...don't be upset that I told you, you knew it was coming.
Then enters the ex-boyfriend who just happens to come looking for her yet the script writers could not seem to come up with good enough material for him, so the ex just sort of reveals who Woods really is and is never heard from again. Hey, at least Michael Madson gets paid.

*humorous smile* *sigh breath* anyway, then we get the typical scene where she gives away her real identity and past on the radio because she just can't take being dishonest anymore! She's been lying to everyone! *sarcasm* While she does say this, the film gives no reason for her to, and any typical human being would just keep going at it considering the complete lack of friction she's faced during her entire stint as a psychologist radio talk show host who isn't really a psychologist. It's ridiculous that someone giving this type of advice could even GET a real career on talk radio... but the movie does that to showcase her ""realness."" If things became any more convenient for Sherrie I think we wouldn't have a good enough movie. .... oh wait, that's right, we DON'T have a good enough movie, but we do HAVE a movie, so we might as well watch it.

While Straight Talk is just filled with completely far-fetched situations that would be handled VERY differently if this were the case in 2011, this does entertain, even just barely, for its 90 minute time length. What keeps you interested? Well, it's not boring, so much as it is just plain cliche and dumb. I think the term ""blonde"" can be used here. It's like the film took every romantic comedy textbook movie cliche and compressed them all into this film, and didn't even do them WELL at that. Once again, Dolly Parton's breasts are the stars of the show, not to also mention her irritatingly ""good girl"" demeanor who surprisingly always seems to waste her time on lousy boyfriends. Well, that is until James Woods came along and very very easily sweeps her off her feet (in case you need me to tell you, their chemistry on screen is eye-rollingly vomit inducing... or shall I just be nice and say utterly and completely non-existent?)

I bought this because it was at a very low bargain clearance bin price at a local retailer, otherwise I would never have even bothered. You've seen this movie a million times before, there's no need to see it again. I feel a bit bad if I'm really ragging on this, but I do it with a slight smile. Dolly is a charming and sweet lady, and considering she wrote numerous songs for this movie, it did mean a lot to her, and you can tell she really does try with her performance, so good for her. It's just too bad the material she was given is just so laughably dumb. Sorry Dolly, you're a sweetheart but I'm just being honest.

P.S. To James Woods - please, PLEEEEEAASE do not ever play a romantic lead again. Your portrayal reminded me of a horny 17 year old trapped in the body of a 45 year old man.

Technical aspects: The movie provides NO extras whatsoever. You get 2 modes: Play movie and scene selection. That's it. As far as the Blu-ray transfer, it doesn't look abysmal and I've seen worse, but you can still make out plenty of burn spots from the original theatrical film. Yes it's fairly clean for Blu-ray, but still terrible for what we expect in Blu-ray quality. If you need to get it, just get the DVD. I understand it is difficult to put these old movies into a high definition remastering, but it is really only worth it for movies that are, well, worth it. One example being The Neverending Story. Old movie with a very beautiful transfer.",1305158400,2,5049,4.4707158351409975
429381,4,6302101395,"I have adored this movie for years, mostly for Dolly's bubbly and loveable performance. The DVD release was lackluster, as it was only presented in full frame and had no extras.

The Blu Ray still doesn't deliver any extras, but we finally have the film in the widescreen aspect ratio that it has always deserved. The picture quality is good (not perfect, but a vast improvement over the DVD version) with a bit of dirt but vivid colors and crisp closeups. Sound is a bit off at times, but overall is again an improvement over the DVD.

Straight Talk is a great film, one of my personal favorites, but it's definitely not a title I would see as high on the list for a Blu-Ray transfer. So initially, I was wary of getting gipped by a sub-par release. Priced at $5, however, I figured I would take a chance on it. I'm extremely glad that I did. The transfer isn't sparklingly stunning as the latest movies in theaters, but it is most definitely an upgrade on the DVD, which I've owned and watched many times. Close-up shots are especially clear, the image doesn't exhibit too much instability (most of the poor quality is limited to the opening credit sequence), and there is very little dirt or debris to be found in the image. The sound was also decent and perfectly capable for the type of movie Straight Talk is. It is limited to the front speakers, however, so don't expect to be completely submerged in sound. The soundtrack is clear, to the point, and it get's the job done. All in all, if you were ever a fan of this movie, I highly recommend the upgrade.

429385,5,6302101395,"After critics enjoyed Dolly Parton's tremendous acting ability in ""Steel Magnolias"" (some believed she stole the film from her Oscar-winning co-stars) studios were after Dolly to star in a feature film. She decided to do ""Straight Talk"", a movie that was written for her by ""9 to 5"" writer Patricia Resneck. The script was actually offered to Dolly several years before, but due to conflicting schedules Dolly could never dedicate herself to the project. The movie was ultimately offered to Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler, who turned it down, so in the early nineties she asked the producers, ""Can I have my script back now?"".

 In ""Straight Talk"" Dolly plays a former dance instructor, Shirley Kenyon, who winds up in Chicago where she gets a job on local radio. While there as a secretary she winds up on the air giving people advice on their lives, children, and relationships. The owners of the station decide on promoting Shirley as their new psycholgist and it is through a series of mishaps and mistaken identities that the film tells its story.

 James Woods was Dolly's leading man in the film and she would go on to say out of all her co-stars he was the best kisser she ever had. Others in the movie include Jay Thomas, ""Desperate Housewives"" star Teri Hatcher (who has a small role as an ex girlfriend of the Wood's character), and Michael Madsen.

 Although well regarded by most movie lovers as a good film ""Straight Talk"" was only a modest success at the box office making only $22,000,000. The critics were even harder on the movie, but CBS did say ""Dolly Parton is very winning"".

 This would be Dolly Parton's last time she would star in a major motion picture for nearly twenty years. She is set to star in ""Joyful Noise"", a movie co-starring Queen Latifah which is set for a theatrical release in January, 2012.

 ""Straight Talk"" did see a DVD release several years ago, but it came in full screen format and had no bonus features. It remains to be seen what, if any, bonuses we might see on the Blue Ray edition. However with this particular Blue Ray release the film is finally presented in widescreen format. This also marks the first Dolly Parton feature film to find a home on Blue Ray.

 There is also a wonderful CD soundtrack that accompanies ""Straight Talk"", but it is long out-of-print. The music was written entirely by Dolly and includes some great numbers including the fun title track, a remake of her 1977 song ""Light of a Clear Blue Morning"", ""Burning"", and many more.",1301529600,3,2502,4.674259681093394

James Woods co-stars, and Dolly has stated that he is the best on-screen kisser she has ever had.
 There is also a companion CD soundtrack to the film that is long out-of-print, but if you can find it pick it up; it features some of the best Dolly-penned tunes she has written.

429468,4,6302101395,"First things first to those who have indicated the film is cropped to 4:3, actually it's not. It's an open-matte transfer, which means the area at the top and bottom that would normally be cropped during projection is left open. Therefore, you aren't seeing it as intended, but you are not missing any picture information either. If you have a widescreen TV just fiddle with your aspect control to frame it properly. Still an anamorphic widescreen transfer would have be preferred.

As for the film, it is delightful, if completely improbably. Still, Dolly is her usual charming, watchable, comical self. She gives the rather formulaic plot a lot of heart. A cast such as this (Parton, Woods, Orbach, Bosco, etc) could have been used more effectively, but the film manages to entertain and bring a few laughs with the bargain. Some of Dolly's best onscreen lines are here, and after seeing the film several dozen times it still makes me laugh.

429534,5,6302101395,"If you want to cozy up to one of the best movies ever, you need to do yourself a favor and boil up a cup of tea, slip on those slippers, and pop this DVD into your entertainment system.  ""Straight Talk"" in all of its Dolly-filled glory, is truly one of the most magical film journeys you're ever gonna take.

Dolly Parton stars as a character who isn't down with B.S. and gives nothing but Straight Talk to anyone that will listen.  That includes Griffin Dunne and the far-underused Charles Fleischer.  Conflicts ensue and barbs begin flying as this no-nonsense gal speaks her mind in a barrage of comic premises.

But then things take a dark turn.  Despair sets in when Dolly realizes that not everyone wants to hear her Straight Talk, and she begin to question her coping mechanisms, her quality of life, and the society she is fighting so hard to change.  There is a bloody battle sequence that may be too grisly for some audience members, but for me it underscored the classic Man Vs. Mankind struggle that has plagued our race (the human race that is, and also white people) for centuries--nay, millennia.

I'm still not sure why Dolly doesn't sing ""9 to 5"" in this movie, because it's a great, great song, but even great directors miss the mark on some obvious choices.

In summation, Straight Talk is not for children, as it encourages deviant behavior, challenging authority, and it features adult film star Dolly Parton in what can only be described as a romp-filled romp of a role that takes her to new levels and is highly reminiscent of Nicolas Cage's brave turn in either ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" or his even braver turn in ""Con Air.""",1175817600,,1643,4.5993150684931505

429537,5,6302101395,"I give ""Straight Talk"" 5-stars because the music is excellent as is the film, of course (I only wish they'd re-release the song on CD), but anyhow, this film is about a woman, who recently fired from her job as a dance instructor in a small town in Arkansas decides to pick up and leave for greener pastures, so she does, (played by Dolly Parton)!

After leaving her small town in Arkansas, then she arrives in her old car and small savings and decides to get a job. She stays in a nasty run-down hotel, but that doesn't discourage Dolly Parton's character, she ""just keeps on truckin'"" and knowing that she can do anything she puts her mind to, goes out for a job. Eventually, she lands the ideal job as a radio talk show psychologist! Her new boss knows that she's not a ""PhD,"" but goes ahead and touts her as a ""doctor of the heart"" and contrary to Dolly's convictions decides to go ahead with the lie because she enjoys helping people so much that she allows the deception to take a life of its own. So, she goes from the run-down hotel room to penthouse deluze aparment, and a pink SL-series Mercedes convertible, not a bad catch, until her conscience finally overrides her to re-think her decision about being a ""doctor of the heart.""

In the film, she gives Chicago radio listeners good old southern down-to-earth advice.  I wish the city I live in has a radio columnist like her.

7821565,5,6302101395,"RELEASED IN 1992 and directed by Barnet Kellman, Straight Talk is a fun drama about a wise, straight-talking rural woman (Dolly Parton) who lands a lucrative gig at a Chicago radio station as Dr. Shirlee, who offers advice to troubled souls. A reporter (James Wood) finds her appealing, but also needs a big story, so digs up dirt on her. Griffin Dunne plays her boss at the station while Michael Madsen appears as her ex-beau. Charles Fleischer is also on hand.

This isn't really a romcom, at least not in the strictest definition (since the movies generally realistic and any comedy in the story is low-key), but rather a light drama with elements of romance and a worthy moral. Theres a moving scene in the last act that reveals Dollys acting skills. Speaking of whom, Dolly shines throughout (not that I was ever a fan, which isn't to say I DONT like her). Shes fit and voluptuous but, most importantly, thoroughly winsome with a genuine smile. Woods is also effective as the male protagonist.

THE MOVIE RUNS 91 minutes and was shot in Chicago & Lemont, Illinois; South Pasadena, California; and Concord, Georgia. WRITER: Craig Bolotin & Patricia Resnick. ADDITIONAL CAST: Teri Hatcher & Jerry Orbach.

Having seen a few tepid female 80s comedies, all of which were entertaining to a degree, I found myself having no expectations for this film, and figured on more sugar coated ""criminal situation turned on its head for feel good resonance"" kind of film meant to deliver a few laughs.  And, to be fair, that is sort of what this movie is, but it doesn't make any bones about being anything other than a woman trying to find her niche in the world with some of the same problems that she addresses with her own brand of hometown psycho-analysis.

Unlike those other 80's comedies I actually found myself laughing at a few parts.  Timing is everything, and this film has a few good key moments, as well as some feel good moments.

A very professionally done film that they just don't make anymore, and I wish they would.  The visuals really help sell comedies like this that don't have many laughs but still a fair amount of good moments that make it worth watching.  There's a real film maker's craftsmanship that happened between the 70s and 80s that seems to have been lost--from writing to shooting to editing.  It makes one wonder why that is.

Take a chance on it.  I think you'll enjoy it.",1501459200,2,1498,4.7011494252873565
