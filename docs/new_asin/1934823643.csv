7801904,5,1934823643,"This animation amazes me in every way. First, there's the visual style: painterly composition and rendering, but marks that look like colored pencil. I mean, I know there's computer assist in there, but it preserves the hand-drawn character I find so warm and appealing. Then there's the story, practically a Rorschach test of layered meanings. You can read it as an eco-fable, or as a quiet sermon on the power of one person's determination, or as a reminder that even among wars - World Wars, two of them - it's possible for someone to hold onto their own peace, or as ... well lots of things, and usually more than one at a time. Really, it might be the most moving animation I can recall.

The other two piece on this disc, ""Every Child"" and ""Mobile"" are good, too, but not memorable. The first shows some poor infant bounced from home to home until it finds its forever family where you might least expect it. Then ""Mobile"" winds up this brief collection with plain goofy fun.

""The Man"" is really the reason to own this, though. It has my highest recommendation.

7801909,5,1934823643,"Exceptional in every way.  A beautiful story, beautifully told.  The animation is nothing short or amazing.  Your emotional response to the story is reflected in, and accentuated by the music score.  The DVD information states this is Region 1 but it played perfectly on a DVD player in region 4.  You certainly can't beat the price on this one, and while I bought it for The Man Who Planted Trees, I also enjoyed the accompanying animations.",1420848000,2,442,4.7631578947368425
