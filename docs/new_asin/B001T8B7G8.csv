8340793,4,B001T8B7G8,It is very long movie and have to be attentive to detail.  I like the fact that you don't know who the killer is until the end.,1401667200,,127,3.7037037037037037
8340794,4,B001T8B7G8,"Our continued fascination with serial killer movies has prompted a constant raising of the bar. While this might not reach the artistic level of ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Se7en"", It's still a great exercise in craft.

Here's the scoop. The body of a murdered young woman is found in the salt of a salt factory in Mexico. The bodies of other young women have been found over a few year period and the only common factor is that they all went to the same high school. A detective from Northern Mexico, who has a dark cloud overhanging him, begins to investigate the case.

This is a very good movie. The script is well measured with a few very unexpected turns. The characters are written well and the actors handle their roles well. These are not cardboard cutouts. Even the local chief of police, who has a history with the detective, and doesn't get a lot of screen time, gets a couple of scenes worth note. The directing and all other aspects of the production are of a very high level. Credit should also be given to the writer and director on how they handled the end. Way too many films drop the ball on the five yard line, and want to please the audience with the warm fuzzies. Not here. These guys took a higher road. Not a pleasant end maybe but more true to life.

This is about as good as this kind of film gets. It was worth every minute I spent watching it. If you're into crime thrillers, have at it.",1339286400,5,1414,4.3283018867924525
8340795,5,B001T8B7G8,Just watched this movie on Netflix streaming.  It is a well done (and slightly different) thriller.  The acting is good and the plot is okay but somewhat predictable.  I gave it 5 stars in comparison to the usual no brain movies produced by Hollywood.,1337040000,,251,4.659090909090909
8340796,3,B001T8B7G8,"Teen girls keep getting kill, I give this movie a 3star, I wanted it to be a lil more scary.... Guess it wasn't too scary but its pretty cool, dvd was new, I'm saying this because I had to order this movie two times just because the other seller sent me a used non working dvd but I got a refune, this is the lowest price I found on this dvd.",1334793600,,342,3.8309859154929575
8340797,5,B001T8B7G8,"This film's spoken language is in SPANISH. The subtitle thing does not bother me when it is a good movie. Storyline holds: Mystery, suspense, Love, Sadness, action. With a song from Mariyln Manson and other great bands that now I have started listening to more.

There have been several cases of woman being disapeard in a small town in Mexico (Santa Rosa de La Sal- In English meaning: Saint Rosa of the Salt) where the SALT is cultivated. That is where the investigation starts, the bodies of these missing girls start to emerge from the salt mines. A new detective comes along from another city, in a way running away from certain past actions and decides to come to Santa Rosa de La Sal, Where there he is introduced to the case of missing woman by his long time police friend. He assists in the case and invastigate who is the murderer and trys to stop him before he kills another woman. They have their clues, but will those clues lead them to the right person? The whole movie is just mystery as to who it could be. Without actual evidence they cannot arrest anyone.

This movie just wants you to know what will happen at the end, who is the one killing this girls and why, are they all related somehow?. And does the detectives  past hold any secrets as why he is there in the first place?

I have a collection of Spanish films and this one is one of my top 5 favorites in general.",1268870400,4,1389,4.372093023255814
