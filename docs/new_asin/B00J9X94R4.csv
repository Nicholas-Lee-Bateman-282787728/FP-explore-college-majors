8649154,5,B00J9X94R4,"My copy of this DVD, purchased from another online retailer, is Region Code ""All"" (worldwide) and that is exactly the correct labeling. It plays just fine on my regular Blu Ray player. That said, this Berliner Philharmoniker program, now recorded almost twenty years old, last day of 1999, is wonderfully exhausting. All of these ""Grand Finales"" require an energetic playing from the orchestra that even tires the players. More than once the recording shows a player gasping for breath because of the tempos, fingerings and breath requirements. What a treat for closing out the millennium! In one selection eight choir members; four each male and female, further demonstrate the quickness and preciseness required for the particular selection. And the audience virtually roars with approval at the completion of each and every segment. It is especially thrilling to watch the woodwind and brass players. Though do not overlook the double basses! Abbado is masterful.",1528588800,,966,5.3202614379084965
8649155,3,B00J9X94R4,"Compared with the version I bought 10 years ago, the speech delivered by one musician before the first Paul Lincke's overture was deleted.

I am very sad about this.",1515456000,,165,4.689655172413793
8649156,4,B00J9X94R4,"The remarkable performance captured on this Blu-ray disc (which I received a review copy of) marks a major milestone: our exit from the 20th century and entry into the 21st. Ordinarily, it would seem risible to program a series of final movements for a concert  like serving a meal composed solely of desserts. However, if you're ending a century, finales are undoubtedly a fitting way to celebrate it, allowing us to enjoy this calorie-dense concert without guilt.

Considering this concert took place about 15 years ago, and that the video has been reformatted to fill the entire HDTV 16:9 screen, my expectations were not high as to picture and sound quality. Im happy to report that the image is surprisingly good (if on the grainy and dark side, particularly with wide shots) and the PCM stereo sound is excellent.

It would serve little use to attempt to review each finale apart from its whole, so Ill just say that Abbado (greatly mourned) and the Berlin Philharmonic are, as usual, as close to perfection as its possible to be. Amazingly, Abbado conducts the entire concerts dozen varied pieces without a score.

Although one of the more unusual inclusions, the end of Schoenbergs Gurre-Lieder, does not have titles, one can follow actor Klaus Maria Brandauers declamations in German with the translation provided in the booklet.

The only thing keeping me from awarding this Blu-ray five stars is that my interest flagged in the final third of the concert, which veered into light bon-bon fare by Lincke and the like. But others might consider that portion just as enjoyable as the rest and a particularly fun way to end the concert (and a century).",1410912000,5,1659,4.889679715302491
8649157,3,B00J9X94R4,"Fun program, superb and entertaining performance but this is standard definition content from 1999 poorly transferred to 1080p Blu-ray format.  Not worth the Blu-Ray premium...buy the standard DVD at half the price.",1406851200,2,215,5.71875
