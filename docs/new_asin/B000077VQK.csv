1804634,5,B000077VQK,"Being a fan of old school symphonic prog, there are not too many post 70's prog rock I care to listen to, becuase it seemed that most current prog bands thought that the music was essentially songs that contained syncopated beats and stacatto structure and melodies. Then I came upon this group. I found this effort to be very impressive and refreshing in that there is that touch of symphonic flavoring (mellotron and classical phrasing) along with neo prog instrumentation. Imagine Flower Kings fusing with Gentle Giant and you have a musical idea of what this excellent band of musicians can do. Definitely first class!",1050278400,5,622,4.933333333333334
1804635,5,B000077VQK,"If you want a great sounding; straight forward concert DVD this is for you. Who cares about great camera work when you get the greatest american band possibly ever.(definately the most overlooked)The bonus audio disc is also very good live and demo stuff. These guys are right up there with Marillion ; and ""GOD"" knows that is saying an awfull lot.",1044057600,,348,4.721311475409836
1804636,4,B000077VQK,"Thank God for Prog.
 And Lord, thank you for musicians like Neal Morse and all the others for their suffering and commitment to bring to the world an art form that endures the test of time. After viewing ""The Making of V"", I myself reviewed my on inadequecies, being a musician for the past 30 years, only skimming the surface of what I believed in, this man took the ultimate gamble and with his brother Alan formed one of the most awesome bands to come along, since Jon Anderson landed back in the late sixties. This ""home movie"" disc is essential for all ""Beard"" fans.
 Now about that concert disc.  When the ""making of"" disc looks and sounds better than the main attraction,what's up with that?The picture is fuzzy. The stage lighting is bland(only blues,reds and yellows and no whites).And worst of all, the sound is mono. The liner notes say dolby sound, but not stereo. But...for the avid fan, don't let this discourage you. Their performance over-shadows it all.
 What really breaks my heart is, there will probably be no more ""Spocks Beard"" DVDs with Neal, since he has been called to serve The Lord. Even though the performance is unequaled for a prog band(the energy level is that of punkers),they are able to tackle each note with precision, accuracy and emotion that would stir the soul of any music fan. This performance should have been captured by(and I wish it had) the same crew that did ""Kansas, Device,Voice,Drum"" or Roger Waters' ""In The Flesh"".But, I guess we should be thankful we have something. I understand the ""Beard"" will go on without Neal and I wish the remaining band all the best, because I personnally will remain a fan. If Kansas can do it without Livgren, then so can they.",1041033600,10,1708,4.664451827242525
1804637,4,B000077VQK,"It's simply tragic that this DVD concert will be the best document of a live performance from one of the greatest bands of the past 10 years, a group that redefined progressive rock music, that crafted epic songs with musical and lyrical excellent, and that to this day remains completely unrecognized by the popular music industry. This is a good DVD, but it isn't what Spock's Beard deserves. The concert is a transfer from a videotape master, providing a highly watchable but far from perfect picture, and the stereo sound is clear but would sound much better in Surround Sound. The second disc, ""The Making of V"" is an absolutely fascinating document of the band's creative process and the inclusion of the video for ""All On a Sunday"" is a great bonus. Still, the production is extremely amateur and might put off casual viewers. Fans, myself included, should be grateful that we have DVD at all, and I'm sure Spock's Beard did the best they could within the confines of their budget. I recommend it as an excellent buy for fans and for those who appreciate innovative music, it's greatest flaw being not what it is but what it could have been.",1040774400,6,1148,4.688118811881188
1804638,4,B000077VQK,"Let me start by saying that this is possibly the worst-looking DVD, video-wise, I've ever seen.  The encoding on the first DVD, the live in Holland disc, is simply god-awful.  The blacks are full of blocking, and the video on the bonus features is so blocky it looks like they're meant to be viewed in a small window on a PC but were blown up to full-screen size.  The video on the second disc, ""The Making of V,"" is far less blocky but still rather grainy.  It definitely looks like a VHS master.
However, having said all that, the poor video quality cannot diminish the fabulous content of these two discs.  The sound is great, the playing is phenomenal, and (of course) the music is magnificent.  The camera work on the concert disc is quite professional, and it's much more enjoyable to watch than the NEARfest/Whiskey or the Live in Leche videos.  The inclusion of the second half of the concert also makes it superior to the ""Don't Try This at Home"" CD.
""The Making of V"" is simply captivating.  The personalities of the band members are revealed, and it is just fascinating to see what goes into the production of a progressive rock CD of ""V""'s caliber.  Great studio footage, great behind-the-scenes stuff, and an interesting look at the processes and technology Neal and his cohorts use.  It's a far cry from the garage-band mentality you see on MTV!
There is also a bittersweet feel to watching these DVDs.  Seeing how passionate and inspired and just plain fun Neal Morse was as a member of Spock's Beard, I can't help but think that something special was lost when he recently decided to quit the band.
Overall, the lousy video is distracting, but once you're captivated by the music and the players (and you will be) you, like me, probably won't mind the poor authoring that much.",1037923200,10,1793,4.624605678233438
1804639,4,B000077VQK,"I've been complaining for years now that the cd of ""Don't Try This At Home Either"" went out of print about a day after it was released.  You see, the Spock's Beard concert on this DVD set was originally released in the form of 2 cds (kinda like what Genesis did with ""The Way We Walk Live"").  One disc, entitled ""Don't Try This at Home"" contained material from Kindness of Strangers and Day for Night.  The other one ""Don't Try This at Home Either"" contained Ryo's keyboard solo, and material from ""The Light"" and ""Beware of Darkness.""
Now, two studio albums later, the whole thing is finally available on DVD.  The concert is stunning.  Morse is not only an absolute ham of a showman, but his voice is just perfect.  He and drummer NDV have instantly addicted vocal timbres.  Kinda like Hayward/Lodge, Anderson/Squire, or DeYoung/Shaw.  They're also just plain entertaining with their onstage personalities.  It's just great.  And where else in today's music scene can you find a lead singer who alternates between keyboards, guitars, and drums, along with a drummer who occasionally plays guitar and takes on lead vocals, a keyboardist who mainly sticks to mellotrons and hammond organs, a guitar player who never uses a pick, and a bassist who gives flashbacks of Chris Squire?  This band in concert is amazing.  The setlist is Day for Night, Mouth of Madness, Skin, Gibberish, Go the Way You Go, June, Healing Colours of Sound, Ryo's Solo, The Doorway, (encores) The Light, Squonk, and Waste Away.  There are bonuses on this disc as well.  My fave is the ""Legend . . . "" bonus, which is the acoustic bit in the middle of ""The Doorway"" at a concert in 2001, where Neal and Alan are both playing the same guitar at the same time (and it's good to) while Nick sings the ""I really don't care"" part before bringing the band back in.  Great great showmanship.
Disc two (The Making of V) doesn't even work on my DVD player, so I can't really review it other than to say the first 10 seconds of each chapter (before the disc skips and/or freezes) are interesting.  Of course, the fact that the disc doesn't even work can't exactly be a positive review.
Disc three is the audio cd that was included as a bonus in the 3 disc ""special edition"" release of their 2002 concept album, ""Snow.""  It's kinda like a making of audio documentary of ""Snow"" with live acoustic versions, and demo versions of the tracks from that album, along with a fantastic outtake of a Yes cover.
In a nutshell, this is a GREAT dvd to own just for the concert, but don't expect much past disc one.",1037232000,6,2564,4.575492341356674
7974766,5,B000077VQK,"This is just what I was looking for.  I was not looking for perfect sound or perfect picture....but to be taken back in time to SEE this band in their prime.  A band-lineup and a time that are both no more.  I just discovered the brilliant Neal Morse and this band in 2014 and am devouring their amazing back-catalog.  So, to be able to just see them do-their-thing on the ""Day For Night"" - tour, to me, is very rewarding.  Heck, if I was there at the show in 1999, I probably would have been drinking; and therefore the sound and vision would have been distorted anyway!  So, this looks and sounds GREAT to me on my TV!!!  The Making of ""V"" was also REALLY cool.  One thing I just don't get though is ""Ryo's (Okumoto) Solo"".  What the heck is that?  Is that some kind of inside joke?  I see no talent displayed there, even though he is a very talented man.",1420243200,,857,4.196319018404908

7974769,5,B000077VQK,If it were possible I would give this DVD 10 Stars. No overdubs on this one. The band plays live and the sound is live. Spocks Beard is one great live band and the sound one the DVD is really live. More bands ought to try this. Keep it up Spocks Beard.,1197244800,,252,3.8653846153846154
7974770,5,B000077VQK,"There is no question that this video allows us into the mind of genius (and the mouth of madness).  Watching Neal Morse working through the creative process is an inspiration.  There are many stand out moments on this video, from driving along the interstate while Neal films from behind the steering wheel as he sings along to Transatlantic, to the studio rhythm boogie of Nick D'virgilio, to the tears that Neal sheds in the privacy of his home studio as he records The Great Nothing.  This DVD set will not let you down.  There is a concert film as well, but it takes a back seat to the documentary in this viewer's humble opinion.",1180137600,,634,4.535087719298246
7974771,4,B000077VQK,"The concert portion of this package is a great show of the beard.  Yes, the sound could be better.  Besides the sound (which isn't all that bad), this is the beard at their progressive best.  The musicianship that shines through is breathtaking.

The Making of V is awesome.  To see these guys at work is inspiring to say the least.  They don't check their emotions at the door.  They invite you into their home, studio, etc. and let it all hang out.

The CD doesn't knock my socks off, but it is good.  If you like out-takes and demo versions, there is some great stuff here.",1156636800,2,576,4.3584905660377355
7974772,4,B000077VQK,"This DVD package documents the only (semi) professionally shot concert you are likely to find from this band. When I got into SB years ago, I had to get my hands on everything the band had put out to that point. After purchasing all their audio CDs, I set out searching for any video material that exsisted. With a couple mouse clicks I quickly found the one and only DVD offered by Amazon---and best I can tell, anywhere. Well it was a no-brainer to buy it right there and then...and I can say I'm glad I did. The concert portion of this package is a perfect example of Spock's Beard's ability to put on a ""No frills-All about the Music"" rock show, filled with plenty of interesting technical music, nice interplay and vocal harmonies and even the occasional quirky antics from the guys. While there is very little to be seen here of a massive, mega stage show, the band more than makes up for that by performing with great precision, passion and seemingly endless talent. Being a musician/vocalist myself, I can safely say that music of this caliber takes a great deal of skill to pull off live(this is NO 'Margaritaville' or 'Brown-eyed Girl').Along with material from the 'Day for Night' album, the band does a nice variety of songs from their first 3 releases(along with a 'worthy' rendition of Genesis' Sqounk). One of the cool things about this group is their ability to play various ""roles"" within the music. Besides Neal and Nick playing musical chairs between guitars, drums and vocals...both Alan and Dave double as effective backing vocalist(and much more on their studio albums). As for those flaws that have been mentioned by myself and other reviewers---the main problem with the production of this package is the lack of any audio options to choose from. No getting around it, the sound quality is not up to the standards the consumer has come to expect with DVDs in the last decade. However, I find it quite bearable to watch...and it hasn't stopped me from coming back for further viewings. The other non-production flaw concerns Neal's vocals---there are definitely a handful of spots in the show where his voice 'cracks' or is slightly 'off-key',  but again, this is hardly a reason not to enjoy this show. I've actually grown to like his voice and lyrical phrasing, along with accepting his occasional vocal 'flaws' while on stage. He's no Steve Walsh or Bruce Dickenson, but he does have his own ""thing"" going that works well for the music.

  As for other material/discs in the set, there is plenty more after you have 'soaked-up' the concert. Most notable is ""The Making of V"". This is a very neat and interesting documentary on what is considered to be the band's best release. I actually enjoyed this more than I had expected---without going too deep into the contents, I personally gained insight into the bands ""down-to-earth"" nature and studio/home recording techniques. I'm usually only good for one or two viewings of interviews and documentaries,  however I find myself watching 'Making of' frequently. The DVD extras and audio CD are entertaining enough-though nothing I often return to. Bottom Line... if this is the only video documentation of the 'Classic' line-up of the band...I'll take it ALL DAY LONG!

Very Recommended, along with first 6 studio albums!",1151884800,,3294,4.852313167259786
7974773,5,B000077VQK,"Another reviewer says the second disc won't play in his DVD player. For me, the second disc worked fine; the FIRST one won't play in my DVD player -- but it plays fine in my computer.

Obviously there are quality control problems with the package (but with all the companies listed on the box, just TRY to find which one to complain to).

This said, the music and the concert are all first-rate.",1141516800,,395,4.397260273972603
7974774,2,B000077VQK,"OK. With the stellar releases of `Kindness of Strangers', `Beware of Darkness', `V', `Day for Night' and on and on, Spock's Beard have created masterpieces in the modern Progressive Rock world with incredible musicianship and flawless production. Not so this DVD. Other reviews have talked about the great sound and perfect musicianship...all qualities that are not apparent here. Let's first address the sound. I had to look at the date of release. I know that it says 2002 but perhaps they meant 1942? The sound is in MONO people! Not Dolby 5.1, not Dolby Stereo, mono! In this day in age, that is totally inexcusable. My cheap camcorder records in stereo if you get my drift. A band that prides themselves in the quality of production should never have allowed this. Video quality is average at best, almost as if you are watching a VHS tape. Musicianship is stellar but Neal's vocals are definitely on the shaky side. He strains to hit high notes, etc. Maybe it was an off night, but again, they should have not released this as it was. It is great to see them live (they never came to my neck of the woods), but it is sad that there will never be a DVD that will capture them in a true digital 5.1 mix and in 16:9 widescreen glory. I am still a fan, but not of this release. If you are a fan, rent before you buy....",1124841600,,1321,4.440329218106996
7974775,3,B000077VQK,"I really looked forward to this DVD. I love the band and discovered that Neal Morse really doesn't cut it live. His singing and keyboard playing are quite sloppy throughout the entire performance. They do perform some great material including Healing Colors of Sound, but the live version pales in comparison to the studio version. Get this only if you are a hardcore fan.",1051228800,2,372,4.828125
