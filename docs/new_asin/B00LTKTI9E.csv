8667963,5,B00LTKTI9E,"Having reviewed the 1979 film before, I had to get the others, on a side note, the 1979 film is not in this set, someone at MGM really screwed up big time, the 2005 film is instead, so buyers beware!!......luckily for me I already had the 1979 film & just needed ""Amityville II & III"", these really are the films to get if you want a good scare........

""Amityville Horror"" (1979).....When released this was so talked about, having read the book I will say that this films follows the book very well, some things are left out, but not much, but the important stuff is in the film......James Brolin & Margot Kidder are very convincing as a couple who just want to raise a family, but as depicted in the book & film, George Lutz is having financial problems with his land surveying business & many believe that the Lutz's fabricated this story to not only get out of a house they couldn't afford but to make money off a best selling book......however both George & Kathy passed a polygraph, so who knows what really happened, whether you believe or not, it is still a compelling ghost story.

""Amityville II :The Possesion (1982)

This is somewhat of a prequel to the 1979 film that depicts the family who was killed by the elder son in 1974, one year before the Lutz's moved in, this one is more scarier as the director goes more for the psychological scare than anything, we see through the eyes of the demon as he takes possession of the elder son & it is quite frightning especially the possession scene itself, Burt Young (Rocky) is the family patriach who is not a very nice husband & father & the family is quite dysfunctional at best, the night of the killings is especially brutal as the eldest daughter (Diana Frankiln) tries desperately to flee the house but can't......we also meet Father Adonis (James Olson) who has a few experiences in the house before the killings & desperately tries to rid the son of the demon as the demon plays on his fears & sins, the ending is quite scary & a bit comical but still scary.....a great prequel even though there are a few inconsistencies, should be viewed first though.

""Amityville III : The Demon (1983)

This one is more or less a sequel to the 1979 film as a team of paranormal psychologists try to debunk the Lutz's story, Tony Roberts play John who is a big skeptic & doesn't believe the house is haunted, he is so convinced that he even buys it, but then strange things start happening first to the realtor who dies, then his assistant (Candy Clark), then to his daughter (Lori Loughlin) & then finally his soon-to-be-ex-wife (Tess Harper)......although this may be considered the weakest of the 3 films, it is still quite entertaining & a young Meg Ryan is here who is also a skeptic who is Loughlin's friend, the ending sees the destruction of the house that is pretty well done.

All in all.....these 3 films are the best of the bunch & are all you really need if you want a good ghost story......everything that came after was not necessary......the 2005 remake doesn't even come close to be scary......an unnecessary remake to say the least.",1489017600,2,3104,4.563734290843806
8667964,4,B00LTKTI9E,"The previous reviewer seems confused about the idea - You are supposed to review the product, not complain about the events that inspired the films. This set contains the first three Amityville movies, each of which is a fun, occasionally spooky haunted house story. It's not Academy Award winning stuff, but it's a satisfying dose of 1970s era horror, and a nice collection for the price. One disclaimer - The set I received had the 2005 remake of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR in place of the 1977 original. I don't know if that's a common error in this set, but worth being careful of.",1465171200,4,580,4.640776699029126
8667965,1,B00LTKTI9E,"This is the most overrated, untrue, made up BS story Hollywood has ever perpetrated on the movie-watching world.  The DeFeo home was never and has never been haunted.  Ronnie DeFeo's attorney, William Weber has admitted that he, along with George and Kathy Lutz, made up this entire ridiculous story so that the Lutz's could have a reason to abandon the home they bought and could not afford to pay for, and to try to make money from a tragedy that happened there in 1974.
Weber has admitted it was a huge lie and a completely made-up story on A Current Affair on the Fox Channel back in 1988 and several times since then. He was a pathetic lawyer hired by Ronnie DeFeo's family who compromised his ethics with this unprofessional behavior and who tried to capitalize on a family's tragic murder.  He did not defend Ronnie properly and on the orders of Ronnie's parents families, defended Ronnie by telling the world that he was insane, which he never, ever was.  Ronnie didn't want to go with an insanity defense but his grandfather was paying Weber and Weber did what he wanted him to do.  Weber also didn't produce information he had at the trial that Dawn DeFeo murdered her mother and that Augustine DeGennaro aka Danny/Douglas Marcello was paid by Dawn to murder her little brothers and sisters.  There is unburned gun powder on Dawns nightgown proving she fired a weapon that night but Suffolk County Refuses to allow Ronnie DNA testing.  There were 2 weapons used because the Medical Examiner stated under oath that Mrs. DeFeo was killed with a different weapon with lands and grooves completely different from the rifle, yet Suffolk County Detectives perjured themselves on the witness stand telling the court that there was only one gun.  There is an Amityville Police Report stating De Gennaro threatened Ronnie and his family right in front of an Amityville Police Officer and 5 other people 2 months before the murders telling him he was going to kill him and his whole family, then moments later tried to run him down with a car in front of everyone there!!!  WHY WASN'T MR. DEGENNARO APPREHENDED AND THROWN IN JAIL FOR MAKING THREATS TO MURDER AN ENTIRE FAMILY??? There was also a call to a police station from a bar patron the night before the murder of the DeFeo family from a guy who was drinking at a bar in Amityville.  He told the desk seargent the guy next to him was telling him that he planned to ""do away with"" the DeFeo family and he told him the guy said his name was Danny Marcello. There is a police report of that incident also.  The public has no idea of the behind the scenes drama that was going on in Ronnie DeFeo's life at that terrible time and they were led to believe by the corrupt Suffolk County Police and DA's Office that Ronnie murdered his entire family which is a bald-faced lie.  The Amityville Horror has made a terrible situation for Ronald DeFeo a continuing nightmare because people actually believe that home was haunted and that Ronnie was possessed by some demon and murdered his entire family.  THAT IS A COMPLETE FALSEHOOD!  If that home was EVER haunted, why would anyone ever live in it.  Several families have bought and owned that home and have never had any problems.  It was never haunted and there are no ghosts.  George and Kathy Lutz's son has even admitted the whole ghost story was a hoax.  Yet Hollywood keeps cranking out movie after movie of the biggest bull s*** story ever bought by the American public.",1444521600,,3474,4.630293159609121
