8075995,3,B000A7S1TK,"While it is a pleasure to witness on video Ms. Baker's remarkable guitar style, but as an instructional video this effort fails miserably. Camera angles are poor, in some cases they do not even show the left hand fingering, or the right hand insert drops out completely. Even when the moderator asks Ms. Baker to slow down the instrumentals, the ""slow down"" is marginal at best. Only the TABs save this purchase as an instructional aid in any real way.",1461628800,2,452,4.6625

8075997,4,B000A7S1TK,"I just love Etta Baker and am still sad that she has passed.  I'm glad her music lives on.  I bought this to help me learn to ""play like Etta"", in my dreams, of course.  It did help, but I am not crazy about the guy that is interviewing her on the DVD.  He almost seems a little rude to this fine lady.  Maybe it's just me.  You can always fast forward past his part to her wonderful playing.",1188864000,5,392,3.8987341772151898
