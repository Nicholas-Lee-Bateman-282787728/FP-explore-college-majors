8458906,5,B0055V0KEA,"Just in time for National Fire Prevention Week, which was on October 9, we got the chance to review ""Wubbzy And The Fire Engine.""  It is a DVD full of six Wubbzy and friends fun-filled episodes!  My boys are hooked on firefighters right now and this DVD was perfect for them.  Wubbzy is a wholesome show for preschoolers that features friendship, teamwork, decision-making, and other issues young kids may face. My boys love how fun and bright the characters are and as a parent I don't mind watching it with them!",1318377600,3,514,4.626373626373627
