8626521,5,B00GS08WOW,"Anything by Ken Burns is top notch and worth watching, but I usually watch it at least five or six times to get everything I can from it. Besides, they are just that enjoyable!",1447718400,3,176,4.205882352941177
8626522,4,B00GS08WOW,"Usual Ken Burns style and very high quality, I am a little disappointed, again as usual, in the particularly USA focused critique of these people, a bit more perspective on what was happening in the rest of the world, not just as a contrast but more to explain where the ideas and approaches were coming from, not everything started and ran in the USA. A usual gripe from the fringes of the empire.",1422748800,,398,4.465753424657534
8626523,5,B00GS08WOW,"Ken Burns is a modern master of the documentary. This collection of human characters teaches us so much about American history, and is presented so impeccably as to be utterly entertaining.",1416960000,,189,5.129032258064516
8626524,5,B00GS08WOW,Really enjoyed this DVD. I would recommend it to anyone wanting more knowledge of these peoples private lives.,1415318400,4,110,5.166666666666667
