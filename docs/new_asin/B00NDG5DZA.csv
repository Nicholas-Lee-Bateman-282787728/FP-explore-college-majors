8677529,5,B00NDG5DZA,"I bought the last copy available on Amazon over a year ago. If this becomes available again, I recommend you buy it fast before somebody else does.  This copy has excellent subtitle and picture quality. It stands up to being watched over 12 times without loosing the quality of the disc.  My friend loves this movie, so we have watched it often at her house. Her vcr/DVD player is so old that subtitles are not an option on her player or remote control. This movie takes very little explanation to be understood. It's just funny. This is the funniest Joo Won role to me.
STORYLINE
Joo Won is a criminal profiler who is working with the police to catch a seriel killer. Everyone's ready and waiting to pounce and arrest him when the criminal can be caught red handed. But, what was that? He got taken out by a hit and run driver. He got hit more than once.  Joo Won is on the case to find the hit and run driver. As he investigates the crime he narrows it down to one person. He goes to the apartment  where someone is delivering noodles, pays him and goes in. He is shocked when the woman insists that she wear a face mask to jail. When he takes the mask off, he discovers that it is his long lost first love. He  gets ready to take her in and questions her in the car on the way to the police station. He's shocked to find out that she doesn't have a drivers license. The car was to learn on, of course, she didn't mean to back over him too. He says well maybe if they write it right she can get off with a minor sentence. She's coughing, I better get her medicine.  Then he gets a call, his apartment flooded. They go there instead. He needs to take her to jail but can't, he still loves her to much. Well, maybe in a few days when she gets better. Then she can turn herself in and it will look better. Poor Joo Won( for the record, that's the actors name and not the character). What does this woman do while he goes to work? Teaches classes on breaking and entering, of course. As the other police investigate her, she asks him to bing a rolled newspaper to her from her house. So, now he unwittingly brought a stolen painting in his house. Now he knows about the classes she teaches and try's to stop the police from catching her, so he dresses up like an American Indian with full headdress, much to the amusement of her students who were taught to blend in. Eventually, he finds out about her crime spree, including the painting in the rolled paper he brought home. They then make a wanted poster, but let me change that, I'll add a mole. Now it's wrong. What, you really have that mole?  And one of her accomplice has also been made. She's  all excited, couple phones ( he didn't want her traced while sick), couple shirts, and now couple wanted posters. He sits down trying to figure out how to reduce jail time. Just return the stuff, of course that means being the highest bidder at an illegal art auction. Now she teaches him her skills, breaking and entering, pick pocketing, lock picking, and repelling on ropes. Will it pay off? This movie is so funny. And when they were younger, she didn't meet him for their anniversary because she was arrested. And he didn't know her real name. That is why he was so heartbroken towards her, but she even had the police drive by the park where they were to meet at, just to see him one last time. There are other funny scenes like her breaking into the neighbors house to steal a toy as she accidentally broke Joo Won's valuable robot. But she keeps going back to that house to get things links salt to cook with. It drives the owner crazy. Joo Won would attend all police weddings, to see if she was the bride as one friend says. Why, because she loved police officers,they are cool. That's why he gave up art in hopes of finding her and became a police profiler. What other illegal acts will he do to protect his love? You will just have to watch the movie to find out.  Replay the end over to see if she actually took something or not. There is a beautiful song that is played during the balcony kiss scene that Joo Won sings. It's a shame we can't buy it, because I would. I will buy EVERYTHING this actor is in, because I've never seen him in any bad roles. He is also in The Good Doctor, Level 7 Civil Servant and Young Pal. So many good Korean dramas that he's in, you can find them easier by using his name in the search bar. I love to buy my dramas from these reliable sellers. BLG WORLD, ASIAN DRAMA STORE, ASIAN MALL, TIMOTHYNG001, KONA AND MORE, SUI GENERIS, and used from CINFLIX. These are the best sellers I have found on Amazon and they have top notch customer service. If you use them you can avoid some of the bad ones I've found. Enjoy the movie. If you want to see more reviews click on my name. I do reviews for Korean ,Chinese, Taiwanese dramas and CDs. I'm trying to review over 200 dramas and my CDs. I will try to list brand, picture and subtitle quality, durability of the drama sets( I have one that only played 3-4 times). How to avoid bad copies, by listing if there is a bad version of it. It's better to wait for the better copy than to buy one and replace it later. If there are special features, do they have subtitles? Do they play on United States players. The music I will list track lists also. These are things I want to know when purchasing an item.  If this helps only one person I will still be happy. As of the day I'm writing this, it is available to watch on the Drama Fever App. It's like Netflix but does Asian dramas and movies and I have been told by my friend is very inexpensive, maybe a dollar a month. I like to watch dramas first then buy the ones I love them most later. I have a book for that. Dramas that come from Malaysia usually have kiss scenes eddited out. I actually contacted them directly to get answers for myself and everyone else on a Chinese drama. So, I'll let you know if that's the case. For music, you can check the singers / groups out on YouTube and type in English subtitles to see if it's for you. Not all have English subtitles though.",1530316800,2,6065,4.2387543252595155

8677537,5,B00NDG5DZA,"I saw this on another website and couldn't get in to watch it, so I decided to buy it instead.  I'm glad that I did.  I've watched it several times already, so I definitely got my money's worth.

Catch Me is about a professional thief and a police criminal profiler, who just happen to be former lovers from 10 years ago.  She accidentally runs over a serial killer that he has been profiling and trying to capture.  When he discovers who she really is, then the fun starts.  I hate people who over review movies and give away the entire movie's high points, so I will stop here.  It's a funny movie with a great storyline, thievery, romance and excellent actors.  I highly recommend it.",1416268800,,687,4.44
