I paricularly like the way they rearraneged Rodrigo Aranjuez' guitar concerto for trumpet.  The result was so unique that makes  you wonder whether this Spanish music piece was originally written for  trumpet or not.  Good story and cheerful execution.

914093,5,6304707029,"I thought this was a really good movie.  I don't know who wrote the DVD file jacket synopsis for this movie because this movie is definitely not a ""comedy treat, hilarious or laugh filled.""  It is also not a story about ""two old friends and ex-lovers (they were 14) whose reunion turns their lives and others upside down hilarious.""  What?  This movie may have a few funny scenes and dialogue but it more a drama about British coal miners losing their jobs.  The miners also play in a brass band together and the conductor (Pete Postlethwaite) is so caught up in the importance of music, that he can't see the lives of his son and co-workers falling apart around him.  The DVD synopsis was obviously a vehicle to pump up Ewan McGregor's popularity but actually I found him one of the least interesting characters in the movie...probably due to his mediocre portrayal.  Pete Postlethwaite, Stephen Tomkinson as his son, and my favorite Jim Carter (Downton Abbey) are all excellent.  I love when Carter's character Harry conducts the band with his hands and fists and his preoccupation with his hair.",1429920000,,1098,4.772486772486772

914146,3,6304707029,"This movie is well acted and has great music from the Grimethorpe Brass Band.  I am always very moved at the talents and musicality of so many of the miners who take part in such musical ensembles, ensembles  that are capable of sensitive renditions of complicated musical scores, including popular classics..  Many factories, heavy industries etc are involved in similar creative endevours.  One major heavy industrial factroy that I remember from my younger days had its own art group and produced many excellent paintings in yearly exhibitions.  These working  men are certainly not the rabble that certain idiotic social elitists claim or suggest they are, but contain many men of intelligence and ability.  However, as the film indicates, though inadequately, other men,  violent union men, often  held their fellow members in terror for their personal safety if they did not take part in their unremitting battles with the middle class.

This production does indicate something about industrial relations in the UK in fairly recent history, but is also  very misleading: don't rely on it for accurate history as it is does not pretend to be anything but a partisan view and a fictionalized slice of British chronology.  Here are my main objections.

Being born and raised in the UK I lived through numerous confrontations between the big unions and the government.  I know how totally irresponsible these unions could be in seeking political and economic objectives, how ruthless they were at seeking their ends.  I know how the miners' union eventually alienated most of the population especially in one very damaging strike in the early Seventies which people remembered long afterwards.  This protracted miners' strike i reference  caused untold damage to the British economy, drastically reducing  the production of electricity, which led to a Three Day Week in factories and offices; workers, ordinary hard-working people,  being repeatedly sent home when the power was cut, losing production, wages, and returning early to homes that had not lighting, sometimes no heating, and no operational radio or television - because of the power cuts.  In ""Brassed Off"" the miners of a somewhat later date, appeared as persecuted and impoverished, whereas they were increasingly  well paid and the leading mlitants among them aggressive and intrasigent - though protracted industiral action led to the impoverishment of their industry, their countrymen, and their  fellow workers.  In realtiy, far from being idolized and objects of pity and sympathy,  the unions became increasingly seen in Britain, by most of the population, as over-mighty, overbearing, and seeking to control the nation's government and the national economy, for their own selfish ends - and  to the detriment of many of the working class of which they posed as champions.

The town of Grimley is fictional but seeks to re-tell the story of Grimethorpe, in the Eighties and early Nineties, whose excellent brass band is featured in the film.  Grimethorpe was a coal mining area and place of extreme industrial confrontation and its miners' union was particularly militant and intransigent; while other branches of the National Union of Miners in other coalfields made peace with management and continued to work, or returned to work, while Grimethorpe held out,  while having violent clashes with the police, and being angrily hostile when reporters  showed up at the pit heads.  The clash I have in mind involved about 5,000 miners and a similar number of police officers.  Ten people were killed in the rioting.  This dark side of the ""Grimley"" story remained untold in the movie.  The press of the time, even the popular  left-wing press (The Manchester Guardian and Daily Mirror), came to harden towards the miners' cause in Grimethorpe.  Only the communist Morning Star, Class War, and similar small circulation revolutionary media continued to back Grimthorpe until the bitter end.  The union attempt to intimidate the free press is not indicated in this very one-sided movie.

I will admit that some of the underlying violence and bullying against those who didn't believe as the most incendiaray union men believed is depicted in this production, but in a farily light, even humorous, way that greatly underestimates the seriousness of the problem.  As in the USA unions typically voted in the open and thugs were a terror to those of more moderate or conciliatory opinions.  When the Thatcher administration eventually made the secret ballot a requirement in union votes, much more moderation was the result.  Men in the movie were shown using the ballot box, so I am unsure of the timing of the reforms.  The movie also indicates pretty well how this  militancy ofunion leaders led to problems and divisions at home with wives, trying to manage diminishing household funds, fighting against husbands too intransigent or afraid to stand to the union bullies.

Movies often portray historical events in a lop-sided way, betrayinggreat  personal  biases or misinformation; this is one of the worst that I have seen in this regard.  This is a great shame as the production had the potential to be more  informative and uplifiting.  I disagree strongly with those who minimize the damage such productions can do with too credulous audiences.",1409270400,5,5319,5.195064629847239

914224,5,6304707029,"In 2005 our Anglican church group traveled to England for a tour of British Cathedrals to get ideas for a new church we would soon be building. As it happened, the tour bus driver was former British coal miner and a horn player in the Grimesthorpe Colliary Band. During the course of the tour, he told us stories of the closings of the British coal mines and the bands that were a part of the coal mining culture.

He recommended that we see the movie ""Brassed Off"" which is a fictionalized version of what happened at the Grimesthorpe Colliary when the mine closed but also is a story of the growing fame of the band as a concert band. Shortly after we returned home, the movie appeared on TV and I was enthralled. It was not just a good movie but a great one. The music was not just good; it was great. With outstanding acting and a superior script, it should have been one of the top movies in the year it was released.

Having heard the story from an actual member of the band, I spent a good deal of time on the first viewing trying to pick him out in the horn section but could not identify him for sure. But, no matter, I would have enjoyed the movie had I never met him and I'm truly glad he told us about it. On top of that, he was the best tour bus driver I have ever experienced which essentially saved our tour from being a disaster because the tour-guide was clearly anti-American and did little to hide her feelings.

This is a movie I probably watch once a year, sometimes more often, and it's one that seems fresh no matter how many times you view it.

As far as I know, the Grimesthorpe Colliary band is still making music in England, though by now, the entire band membership has probably completely turned over. A look at current DVD and MP3 offerings shows a multitude of guest conductors but the unique sound of the band remains the same. I'm a big fan of concert band music as well as plain old March Music and this band's sound is special. Not being a musician or sound techniciam, I can't explain why, but it's the same kind of thing that made the music of orchestras during the big band era different one from another.

This band is special and this movie is special. I recommend it without reservation.",1382313600,4,2228,4.307875894988067

Yes, there's a boy-girl story, but it's nothing like the DVD cover depicts. Instead, it's just one thread in a tapestry woven around the lives of coal miners and their familites in Yorkshire, England, and the effect of coal mine closures under the Thatcher regime.

The ""editorial review"" seen on the Amazon product page is taken directly from the DVD cover and it so misses the mark it's hilarious! In fact, this marketing copy should win an award for completely missing the point.

This is not a screwball comedy about the madcap adventures of two ex-lovers. It's a heart-felt story of hard working people in England who are facing unemployment due to their coal mine shutting down, and how the town's brass band keeps a few of them united and hopeful. Other customers have already written more about the story line, so read those reviews for more details.

If you love well-crafted, beautifully made films about complex characters superbly played by great actors, then you'll love this movie.

A summer sitting in the shell at South Shields listening to a colliery band, the shell of the arena protecting us from the bitter, northern wind, is a good memory. This movie has a feel good quality (no not Tara or Tara and Ewan) but the storyline that has worked for so many British films milking the genre of the working class community struggling to make good. But this film has bite. It is not all beer and cornets. A bleak thread runs through this film. Working industries toppling to their knees, families disintegrating, values taken for granted changed and changed beyond repair. There is the perfect antidote to Ronald mcDonald in this film, the clown of despair. It is a film that as well as the schmultz (Tara and Ewan) is about the universal of working communiuties struggling to put food on the table and support famlies. The dysfunction when misogeny and loss of work identity collide and pride is stripped from a man. Of course it has to all end happy like, but what the heck! There is enough in it to make it watchable without needing the brown bag. And last words to Mr Postelthwaite's character ""I used to think music matters, does it bollocks! its people that matter!""

Tells the story of the twenty-some-odd members of a Collier Brass Band and their small village. It's a word I was unfamiliar with until this movie, an English term for what we call coal miners. A novel concept to this American - coal miners whose extracurricular activities involve a band that isn't based on guitar, fiddle, or jug.

Eighty unbroken years, including two world wars and the Great Depression, destined to go the way of the dinosaur. Why? Their coal mine is scheduled for ""redundancy"" - aka closure. But only, and this is important, only if the community itself votes in favor of ceasing operations and effectively killing the township. And despite the loud brash talk in public quarters and the hammer fists at the union hall, it's clear that the majority of the town's residents are tired of fighting. After a solid decade of defiant strife, they want the money; enough funds to pay off long-standing family debts, move away and start over someplace else.

Everyone except the traditionalists of the Collier Band. Led by grand character actor Pete Postlethwaite portraying the band's conductor, this small segment of miners represents some of the last holdouts - the pitiful few stalwarts holding back the tide of populist opinion.

If one could mentally transport oneself to those very volatile times, this actually plays less as a romantic-comedy (where it succeeds wonderfully) and more as political statement. Mine closures across the UK were a hot topic when this film was produced in 1996, fully ten years after the government stopped subsidizing the coal industry. The lives of most these hardworking men shuttered, their families scattered to the winds.

Unsurprisingly, their story hasn't lessened by the passage of time; this film still carries with it the proud legacy of these people and the fight for their heritage.

And although Ewan MacGregor is the headlining artist, and no complaints about his usual excellence, it's actually Stephen Tompkinson, as the conductor's son Phil, who really hit home the message. A terrifically acted and painful performance as he exposes the terrible costs of trying to obey two masters - the one in his pounding heart and the one in his head screaming common sense. The sheer suffering he puts out there for everyone to see is palpable and delivered with such emotional energy that it honestly hurts to watch. His on-screen execution a sincere kick in the gut. Genuinely powerful stuff.

A bleeping crime and damnable shame that Tompkinson's portrayal didn't even merit a BAFTA looksee at the time.

Scripted with a deep sense of conviction, a screenplay worthy of being told, filmed with acute technical skill, and filled with performances that reflect the very best of the craft. No question a five-star production.

Personal Note:

- A difficult film to review given my perspective on unions. In my defense, and to be bluntly fair, the modern union is about as close to it's original form as a Britney Spears cover song is to an original done by The Beatles.

By freakish happenstance, I also happened to rescreen this film as I was beginning Ken Follet's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Century/dp/0451232852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Century</a>' Trilogy.

But one would have to be insane or delusional comparing their modern gluttonous and slovenly incarnations to their horribly mistreated and noble progenitors.",1348876800,4,3896,5.401976935749588

914416,5,6304707029,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY REISSUE ***

Set in the fictional mining town of Grimley in North Yorkshire ten years after the calamitous British miner's strike of '84 to '85 - ""Brassed Off"" is about a colliery band with a 100-year history facing dissolution should their coal pit be closed by a determined powers-that-be (the Tory party bent on destroying the Trade Unions and their strangelhold on business). It's a small British movie about big British things and when it was released into cinemas in 1996 - it delivered its laughter and tears with a passion that disarmed many at the time.

In fact - re-watching it now on this superlatively clean and crisply rendered 2012 transfer to BLU RAY (the absolute best its ever looked) - I'm once again struck by its huge heart and the great performances from a committed cast - and that mass job losses devastating a community is still painfully relevant to this day.

Written and Directed by MARK HERMAN (who went on to do the equally good ""Little Voice"", ""Purely Belter"" and ""The Boy In Stripped Pyjamas"") - this is a working-class world where housewives have a filter-cigarette and a cup of tea on the garden wall while their frayed padded-bras flutter on the clothesline in the morning breeze. People shop in downmarket chains like Spar and Kwik Save and say ""daft"" and ""bugger"" all the time. Life is a struggle and money always a problem - and if the pit closes then there will literally be 'no future' for hundreds of men and women with families to support...

A lot of the movie's seething underbelly of anger and frustration is offset by self-deprecating jokes... When Danny the ailing conductor of the brass band (Pete Postlethwaite) gives his sappy son Phil a piggyback on his bicycle to band practice (a truly fantastic Stephen Tompkinson) - demented by four kids, a crippling mortgage and loan sharks - his had-enough wife Sandra (Melanie Hill) chucks plates at him as he leaves. Danny casually remarks as they cycle away - ""...bit clumsy with the crockery your Sandra..."". When local girl Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) returns as a business sophisticate to do a feasibility study on the viability of the pit - she is fondly remembered by the pool-playing Andy (Ewan McGregor) for giving ""top half only"" when she was a teenager. Their rekindled romance is lovely and believably real.

But sadness and frustration are never far away from the surface either. A husband and wife cross each other on the footpath in the morning as their shifts intertwine - too tired, too rushed and too beaten to speak (Jim Carter - now the Butler Mister Carson in ""Downton Abbey""). When they do talk the 3rd time it happens she remarks - ""You used to be full of fight..."" He drops his head - it's true. Wives and mothers huddle around kettle-drum fires for warmth and sit in makeshift tents outside the colliery gates where their constant chant goes up as the scabs pass the picket line - ""The miners united - will never be defeated"". When of course they were...

Debt Collectors punch out a desperate father in front of his wife and kids - and a few days later coldly remove all their worldly goods from their home. A friend manning the cash register in a local supermarket slips a 10 note behind the receipt to a mortified mum who can't afford 60p Orange Squash for her kids. At least a form of redemption is offered to them by way of their entry into the National Finals held in London - which they proudly attend and win with a rousing performance of ""Charge Of The Light Brigade"". And it all ends with Pete Postlethwaite's rousing speech to the assembled - tearful stuff full of pathos and heartbreak.

PICTURE QUALITY/EXTRAS:
It opens with miners down a pit finishing their shift in the dimly lit caves - so there is some grain - but once they emerge into the yards from the lifts and from thereon in - this May 2012 Channel 4/Miramax release looks 'so' good it's positively disarming. Its default aspect is 1.85:1 - so it fills the full screen naturally (no bars top or bottom).

The extras are disappointing though. The interviews with the principal four are short and enthusiastic - but hardly great and the 'Sub Plot Extra' merely cobbles together scenes you've seen already - pretty pointless and irritating. The Biographies and Photo Galleries offer some info and images - but it's all terribly underwhelming and no real improvement on what went before. Still - there is that picture quality...

I honestly hadn't expected to be so 'moved' by ""Brassed Off"" this time around - yet the script got to me on several occasions. Pete Postlethwaite's character lying in a hospital bed with blood in his lungs and sadness in his heart - when the boys gather outside in the dark and begin playing ""Danny Boy"" in a Brass Band style. I'll tell you - it's a hard man indeed who doesn't shed a tear.

To sum up - at last ""Brassed Off"" is given the transfer it thoroughly deserves - and if you've any affection at all for this ballsy little film - then you need to own it on BLU RAY. And what a great way to remember Pete Postlethwaite - exuding that everyman humanity that engendered him to a whole nation.

Nowt wrong with that ye daft buggers!

914486,4,6304707029,"I've always loved this funny/sad/melodious movie.  I had it on VHS way back when. And the CD of its brass band music is among my favorite get-off-my-butt-and-clean-the-house discs.  I've just found three excellent reasons for  buying it on DVD:  1. Because it's now  available here on Amazon for under five bucks.  2. Because it's got Downton Abbey's  butler, Jim Carter,  in it in a very good role.  3. And because I suspect  this story of the closing of Britain's coal mines and its impact on a Yorkshire town and its people  will make a pretty interesting DVD double feature with ""The Iron Lady"" and  Meryl Streep's Oscar-winning performance as Margaret Thatcher.

The only thing I'm a little brassed off about about this disc is that when  you want to watch a particular chapter, they're only listed by number--1 through 10--which neither shows nor tells you where in the film a click will take you.  Even worse, a click will usually put you in the middle of the scene you wanted to rewatch  (e.g. a click on #10 plops you halfway through the finale's ""William Tell Overture."")",1330473600,6,1081,4.731182795698925

914488,5,6304707029,"I am a former Brit now living in the USA and this Movie pretty well tells the story of a collapse of the coal industry.  Near Wolverhampto, where I was raised, which is in the heart of the ""Black Country"" or Midlands where the Industrial Revolution began, coal mining was essentially the only industry.  Coal was the life blood of England to support that technological advancement both in the UK and around the world.  In the fifties coal was replaced as the fuel of advancement and replaced as the principle fuel of the economy and production.  Modernization and Nuclear power supplanted coal thus the closing of the mines and the loss of a quarter million miners and support personnel jobs.  This story brings some background of that pain to light.

 The music is great, as was most Coalleries bands were but I didn't think it is much of a comedy or love story.  The acting is very good and believable, but then I lived through that period so I may be more sensitive to the historical portrayal.  The movie is essentially historically true.

914490,5,6304707029,"I've seen this movie twice now on satellite, and haven't tired of it. There's a lot to like. After a heavy dose of Transporter 1 through 25, Fast and Furious, various Star Treks, Star Wars, and gritty spy killing spy flicks, this is a wonderful little dose of reality - gee, I actually can sit through a thoughtful film without car chases, heroes without superpowers, and no one dangling from a helicopter getting shot at by a chain gun. Sounds un-American. That being said, this is a nicely acted, sensibly filmed story with a happy ending sandwiched in an unhappy circumstance. The actors even look like real people, even the lovely Tara Fitzgerald (every town has at least one beauty, right?) It gives the viewer a sense that amidst chaos, something lovely can still be born. The music is great. It makes me wonder why American brass bands can't do what brass bands do best - give you some real toe tapping tunes. The local university has a pretty good band, but what do we hear at half-time? We Will, We Will Rock You. C'mon! Surprise us! Turn our heads! The Grimethorpe Colliery Band is one of the best. They first came to my notice in a Disney film about pit ponys. It was another bittersweet tale about coal mining in the north of Britain when pony's pulled the carts and never saw the light of day, doing their jobs and trudging the tracks back to their subterranean mangers for a bit of sweet hay from a world they'd never see or taste again. Grimethorpe did the track for that one too, and it made me stay to the end of the credits to see who played that great music. A big thumbs up to the Brits for still creating films that make us think and feel without gut-churning special effects, and reminding us that you don't need an electric guitar to make great music, and the world is populated with people like you and I, people who pack trombones and trumpets, not machineguns and grenades.",1241827200,2,1899,4.491329479768786

There is something about brass bands.  Some sense of community, some sense of coming of age, some sense of the underdog to more accepted forms of music like symphonies and angst-ridden twenty-something pop.

This is a great movie for all who were part of bands in high school or community bands where they may have played in the band shell during the summer. The plot is basic and the conflict is simple but the music and the love of how it reflects the locals and creates some pride is wonderful.  The actors are better than average and certainly well known.  The parts are not challenging but still the piece works its magic.

It is a Brit thing, for some that may increase the honesty of the piece. Did not matter to me, a good reminder about music that moves without the charts, the hype, and the mass market appeal.",1238457600,3,961,5.207792207792208

Every time I watch this film, which I do fairly regularly, it brings it all back: the community split between fight and resignation, the women fighting for their men's - and therefore their - livelihoods, the loyalties and frictions, the sense of helplessness under attack from Thatcher and the southern government, the humour through everything, the ability to achieve greatness when the world is falling apart. Oh, and the language!

914539,4,6304707029,"This movie, along with a masterful cast, truly deserves five stars! Yet it was nearly awarded a mere 3. Why?

The storyline and the acting are superb. The production is excellent and the camera-work first rate. Even the coarse - but truthfully and accurately portrayed - language, is acceptable to this reviewer, although it might not be to everyone.

So, what was it that so nearly caused this movie to be classed as 'poor' entertainment? It was the strident, over powering, political haranguement the viewer was subjected to throughout the movie. Rarely does a political argument become relevant for long. Time changes all things - including political thought and actions. What was highly relevent in the 80's is, now, utterly irrelevant. This movie was set in the troublesome times of the 80's in Industrial England - in particular, a mining area.

If the viewer can view the movie as a movie and enjoy the craftsmanship that went into it from all concerned, it is a most enjoyable experience. If, however, one allows one's politics to interfere - then the movie becomes an annoyance.

Take heart, however, the politics espoused were not those of the reviewer. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the overall great product that was 'Brassed Off'!",1152316800,3,1248,5.0144927536231885
914540,5,6304707029,"This is one of those movies that they felt had to be dressed up a bit in order for the dumb movie audience to give it a chance.  Or so this is how they film studios see it anyway.  This is certainly a message movie, and its not so sutble message about anti-Thatcherism hits you on the head like a brick! Americans ignorant about Britain today might have a hard time following it.  However, if one disregards the rather dated politics here, the theme of the movie can be seen as a universal one in that long-time workers are now frequently the victims of changing economics.

More than anything else this is a movie about music and brass bands. The opening march by R. B. Hall ""Death or Glory"" says it all!  For the players in this band their fight for the mine is a death or glory proposition. Incidently Hall was a little known New England composer of marches, and its interesting that his music should make it back acorss the pond for English brass bands.  My personal tastes runs for Military bands in which the instrumentation is richer and more varied.  Brass bands don't have any woodwinds!  The softer tone they produce is a more mellow sound, compared to the richer, stirring military band.

Its nice to see that the working class of the mines in England produced these high quality bands.  No comparison can be fond here in the States with mine workers.  You would sooner find most US blue collar workers in topless bars after their shift rather than going to band practice!  So these bands are a part of England's cultural scene, and the popular band music they played was often a bridge for the common man between the classical concert hall and the out-door band concert.  Their loss would certainly be sad.  The band portrayed here in the film is an actual famous brass band, and it would be interesting to know if it was really disbanded because of the Yorkshire mine closings.

The actors do a fine job.  Pete Postlewaite is wonderful.  Anything he does seems to be golden.  Tara Fitsgerald is very appealing and seductive. Shes's also wonderful to see in almost anything. The plot has its usual twists and turns that keeps the interest.  The human dramas behind the music is what is most compelling about this film.

A movie should be made about the many fine regimental bands that have been disbanded in the British army in recent years.  Like the civilian band portrayed here, many of these bands had histories that went back for centuries, and their loss to the regiments which had them was keen.  The many fine musicians in them were also forced into redundancy or had to seek non-musical employment in the army.  Certainly what Blair has done here is every bit as bad as what Thatcher did to the mines.  The destruction of these many fine military bands was a loss to communities as well as to the morale of their regiments.  The loss of any band is a cultural loss, whether civilian or military.  With young listeners today increasingly having no exposure to music other than dreadful pop, the loss of such bands is truly a dire situation.  These musical entities with their free open air concerts were a vital link for people to hear different kinds of music.  I can't imagine what the music tastes of people will be in the future.  For sure it won't be that good.

This is deffinitely a fine movie, with good plot, strong acting, and some wonderful brass music.  If viewers become inspired to listen to this kind of music as a result of this film then all should not be in vain.

This film must be viewed with a sense of the real life background--the great miners strike of 1984. How in the world it could be called a comedy beats me.

Peter Postlewaite is superb and his closing address deserves real attention. So now the Brits import their coal from pits worked by childeren for  7 cents an hour.

The film was made by Channel Four Televison in association with Miramax Films. Channel Four are one of the leading TV channels in the UK that do not get money from the government. They rely on income from advertising and sales of their programmes (unlike the BBC!).

Brassed Off is just as relevent today to the UK and many other parts of the world I am sure. Whole communities ruined as industries change. This will be the case in many developing countries and many developed countries.

However, although Tara Fitzgerald, Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite gave outstanding performances (ignored by the Oscars!) I personally think the real stars of the film are the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. Outstanding performance in a film!

In the last 10 years or so the UK has turned out some outstanding cinema. And in the UK motion picture studios are back in full business ( even if we have numerous American producers/directors filming over here!)

So lets get to the movie. I titled my review as such because when I did a ""Big Fish"" review, someone else called that film the ""Terms of Endearment for men"". Which I didn't get. (If you read my review on that movie (please do and if it is helpful rate me please!) It was more about the adventures of one man, Edward Bloom, than about the relationship dynamic between a father/son. Maybe the lack of a relationship, throw some ""Postcards From the Edge"" in there and really confuse people-but I don't know. That comparison was making a purse out of a pigs ear if you ask me. And if you're reading this, you're asking me, -sorta.

I should note that you have to read my ""about me"" section if I tend to wander. It'll mangle your mind.(Reference to another film-Velvet Goldmine, 5 Stars also)

So back to ""Brassed Off"" and time to stop being brassed off about the ""Big Fish"" review.

It's an older movie but since it's set in one of those
Ireland/Scotland/Wales/North Britain villages that never age it's timeless. It could be happening yesterday for all we know except for a brief reference to Margaret Thatcher as the current Prime Minister at the beginning.  The story is typical and well known. It's been done with great success in
many films, the most popular probably being ""The Full Monty"" which also went on (inexplicably) to be a broadway musical.

The ""MANAGEMENT"" (ooh they MUST be evil) are deciding whether the coal mine that supports the town is viable or not. Lines are drawn, we are supposed to root for the litle guys who of course aren't the scabs and all of them just happen to play in the only other viable operation the town has going for it, a brass band.

That is after they climb out of the mine shaft covered in soot, swinging their lunch-buckets at the end of the day, and are suitably cleaned up. You can picture it already can't you? Hard working lads who enjoy a pint now and then.

Immediately we are introduced to the the character of ""Glorious [...] Gloria""(Tara Fitzgerald) who left the town sometime ago. How happy under the circumstances that not only does she play the fluglehorn brilliantly, she also works for MANAGEMENT; and has a shared past first sexual experience with Andy (Ewan McGregor), a trumpetor himself. She just doesn't feel the need to disclose that bit of information to anyone, not even poor Andy.

This fits neatly into what is essentially a sideline to the story.

The heart of it is Danny (Pete Postlethwaite), the bands conductor, and Phil(Stephen Tompkinson), his son who got into a lot of financial trouble during the last strike at the mine years ago and is losing everything, including his family and eventually part of his mind now that MANAGEMENT is back in town. It is this story that holds ""Brassed Off"" together, not
the Ewan/Tara subplot that the box cover wants to sell copies from because of Ewan McGregor's fame.

I am a giant Ewan McGregor fan, just look at my profile and lists and you'll see that, but this movie is soooo not about him. He is a bit player. If that is what you are shopping for then ok, it's a good part, small but good.

Other than that it is the story of how a town can drag itself out of the ashes, how a father and son can have a relationship together that isn't manly or sappy but real. It is a story of how sometimes when you have very little to hold on to it's better to hold tighter when giving up would be the easiest thing to do. Spoiler alert if you read the next paragraph!

The ensemble casting was perfect. These were real people. This was a real place.  It has a happy ending -I'll spoil that for you but isn't that what you want? A happy ending?

This is a film that depicts people who have reached the very lowest they can go and the very highest they can acheive, and yet there is still room for more hope and happiness at an unfinished ending. I highly recommend this to anyone who liked the Full Monty. I recommend this and add that you wil enjoy it more. I also recommend the soundtrack. Who knew Danny Boy by a brass band could be so
moving?",1118793600,4,4169,4.43848167539267
914545,5,6304707029,"To read the synopsis on the back of the box, you'd assume this is just another fluffy romantic comedy.  Did the writer even watch the movie?  While it does have its comic and romantic moments it's basically a serious look at the residents of a British mining community and the stress and despair faced by families and community as their source of livelihood, the mine, faces closure.  The story follows the one remaining ray of community pride as the miner's Colliery band competes for a shot at the championship in London.  It also follows the political and management process of choosing efficiency and profit over the welfare of the miners.

The entire film is well acted, the music is outstanding and the story is at once heart-breaking and heart-warming.  A wonderful movie!",1117065600,6,779,4.863636363636363

Having been in a british-style brass band here in the United States that went to the ""nationals"" (NABBA), this was a very enjoyable movie to watch.  Ewen McGregor is listed as a supporting actor in the movie, but it is really an ensemble cast.  Pete Postlethwaite runs amuck going from highs to absolute lows throughout the picture.  The brass band is a real band from England and this is a true story that is being told.  The William Tell Overture would never be used as the ""test"" piece for a brass band championship, but it is very recognizeable to a wider audience and makes for a great finale piece as it is used in the movie.  It is fun to hear a brass band perform the piece.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is a real sleeper and deserves to be seen.",1114560000,6,838,4.292993630573249
914605,5,6304707029,"Unfortunately, this movie came out around the time of ""The Full Monty"" and it also deals with the unemployed in dying industries in Britain.  Where ""The Full Monty"" is funny ""Brassed Off"" is serious and wrenching.  No punches pulled here.  It avoids bathos because it keeps it eyes focused on the bewildered pain of the coal miners and their families.  ""Monty"" became a huge hit and ""Brassed Off"" went away largely unwatched.  It deserved better.

The story is set in the time of Margaret Thatcher.  Many of the old government owned industries were drowning the government and bleeding taxpayers.  They were privatized or closed.  This caused terribly painful dislocations (as did the much needed recession in the US in the early 1980s).  Through this movie we get to see how these dislocations crushed everyday folks caught in the moving parts of these changes.  I come from a working class background and have seen the pain of recession and dislocation up close and personal.  It hurts and really fine people who work hard and just want to get through life are often damaged severely.

The Grimley colliery (a colliery is coal mine and attendant structures) has been in operation for a long time.  One of the traditions of many large working class operations is a brass band whose players are drawn from the workers.  In the United States, community brass bands were quite common until WWII.  The Grimley band (there is a real life Grimethorpe Colliery band that plays the music in the film) has a long and proud tradition and in the movie is led by Danny (played by the fabulous Pete Postlethwaite).  It even has its fans and groupies who dye their hair the same shade of purple as the band uniforms.

The music in the film is a wonderful device and only partly because the band music sounds so good.  Art is always an extravagance.  How much do you sacrifice in time and money for it?  That is always the question and the balance.  As I say, my parents worked hard as I was growing up.  However, my Dad sang beautifully and the love he and his friends had for music rubbed off on me.  Heaven knows the price my own wife and children have paid for my devotion to that art.

Danny's son, Phil (poignantly done by Stephen Tompkinson), plays trombone and is a bit of a bumbler.  He supplements his income for his family by being a rather inept clown as well.  There is a beautiful but awful side story in the film about Phil's need of a new trombone and his struggle to balance that against the needs of his family and yet what price art?  His wife bears the cost of his devotion in wrenching ways.  Phil is the point on which all the weight of this film bears to crushing effect.

A young Ewan McGregor plays Andy.  For me, Andy points to the whole heart of the problem.  Andy is a very bright young man.  He really does understand what is going on.  However, he has always felt like a loser, so he turns himself into one.  When I see the passivity and sense of entitlement in the soon to be redundant miners, I frankly get a bit frustrated.  No power on earth can stop economic dislocations from happening.  Oh, they can be delayed, but a greater cataclysm will follow.  And why should other taxpayers be forever burdened with providing a subsidized living for an inefficient industry?  Yes, the Grimley pit was making money, or so the report showed.

However, none of these people had enough of a financial education to put the pit in the broader context to see if it made sense to operate one pit.  This is what bothers me.  We have to do a better job of preparing people to make changes in their lives.  We have to equip them with a better understanding of economics and finance.  Of course, that will make them more expensive, but they will be more expensive because they will be able to create more value.  Being more flexible with the ability to provide more value is a good thing.

I won't get into the whole drama of the movie except to say that it is honest and touching.  The politics are quite anti-Thatcherite, which is appropriate for the characters.  However, I think the filmmakers were pushing their own agenda a bit through the voice of the characters and that is a tad bothersome.  Thatcher was no more responsible for the economic dislocations than gravity would be if you fell off a roof.  But I guess you have to blame someone and she was certainly convenient.

In any case, a fine movie.  The language is a bit rough and you might (might) have a bit of a trouble with the working class accents.  I encourage you to see it.",1111104000,3,4546,4.514110429447853
914606,5,6304707029,"'Brassed Off', as the name suggests, is a movie about a Brass Band from a coal mining pit in Yorkshire (in Northern England). If you do not consider yourself a big brass band fan then do not let this put you off because for one reason, unlike most movies based in England, this movie does not contain Hugh Grant, and, therefore, does not contain a soppy love story about a brass band worker who meets some nice lass and after some trials and tribulations ends up getting married. Instead this movie gets to the nitty gritty of life in England during Thatcher's administration, and the impact that her conservative government not only had on the brassed band, but also the whole communities that the coal mines supported in the U.K.
 Made up of some fine actors, the band not only performs some fantastic musical pieces, but also reflect the tightness of the communities that supported the mining pits across the UK during the 80s and 90s in Britain. Brassed Off is a tragic comedy about a band that plays through the turmoil of the political situation at the time that not only threatens the mere existence of the band, but also their livelihoods at the mine pits and the entire community that the mine supports. As a movie about a brassed band this is a great show, but as a movie about a true reflection of life in Britain this is a fantastic piece. Highly recommended.",1085529600,10,1371,4.573170731707317
914607,5,6304707029,"This movie features a colliery (coal mine) band that mustn't be missed.  It is unbelievably good.  In the days of active mining, many mines had their own brass bands and this real band is probably the best ever assembled from among uneducated men who spend their working lives in the dank, dark passages of a coal mine and practice their music at night.
The story centers about the band and the miners who have been laid off because Margaret Thatcher has close hundreds of collieries who could not compete with foreign coal any longer.  The government officials pretend that they want the mine left open, but they have already been ordered to close it. The story line is not only correct in what actually happened to mines, but it also contains a budding love affair between Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor.
Like all movies of this type, this one turns out well, but the road to the ending is tense and very entertaining.
Well worth while video to have.",1062201600,6,955,4.6390532544378695
914608,5,6304707029,"The cover makes it look like a light-weight romantic comedy, and while there is some romance and comedy, it is more about how a town is effected when a large employer is shut down, and how despite this tragedy, the people must move on and find some joy in life, and figure out how to move ahead and find a way to cope.

  When I first came across it in my Public Library, though I love Ewan McGregor I dismissed it as a disposable predictable romantic comedy (I read the back description, but I didn't really pay much attention to it due to the cover, silly, yes). When I saw it was going to be on IFC I decided to give it a go, and I did, not once, but twice!

  I loved it. It is just as good the second viewing, and the brass music is mesmerizing. It amazingly emotional and beautiful.  The  movie is not in the least bit a cheesy romantic comedy, its not a romantic comedy at all.  One of the story-lines running through contains some romance, but it is not the overarching theme.  It primarily has to do with how these people deal with the closing of a coal mine (which is the town basically) and how it effects their everyday lives. How they keep playing with their brass band(though they keep wanting to quit and some do). It is the one thing that seems to keep them somewhat sane in a time of personal and emotional turmoil.  The ones most effected that are in the Brass band, is the bands leader Danny and his son Phil, McGregor and Postlethwaite are wonderful in their roles, bringing humor to this tragedy.

A touching and humorous film about living life to the fullest especially when times are rough, and your life literally tumbles around you(which I find humorous how those whom happily close or support the closing of coal mines in America or anywhere else, are not offering job alternatives to those whom lost their jobs, maybe they need to watch this film).  .

914609,5,6304707029,"The heritage of the English coal mines (collieries as they are called) has been a mixed one of industrial production, labor strife and music.  Music?  Indeed, the existence and competition of employee brass bands formed as a diversionary activity for the miners is overlooked by most people born outside of the English coal mining commmunities. What began as a mild diversion has since provided a rich legacy of music that should not be ignored. But musical legacy notwithstanding, there are other factors at play in this wonderful little movie like the Tory policies of Margaret Thatcher's U.K. and the forced closure of many mines over recent years.
The idyllic (although certainly not prosperous) existence of one such group of miners is attacked on two fronts; first by threats to close down the colliery, but the addition of a woman (Tara Fitzgerald) to the all male ensemble is even more unsettling.  Her talent as a flugelhornist is as bothersome to the members of the band, as her beauty is to one bandmate in particular (Ewen MacGregor). Ms. Fitzgerald has to be the best kept secret in the British cinema as she combines fantastic ability with an almost sublime beauty.  I'd rent a ""How to Fix a Flat Tire"" movie if it featured Tara's face and lyrical voice.
Besides the lovely Ms. Fitzgerald, two other actors stand out. Ewen MacGregor shows more range in this role than both of his Star Wars appearances thus far (he also has a much better script to work with).  And Pete Postlethwaite would have received an Academy Award nomination had more people simply seen this movie. Postlethwaite is something of a British William H. Macy; he's always rock solid in his character and talented enough to give uniqueness to each character he plays.
Faced with the extinction of their jobs and way of life, the members of the Grimley Colliery Band rally around their leader (Postlethwaite) as they battle economics, black lung and an evolving world.  Their quest is to win the nationwide band competition at Prince Albert Hall.  Despite a misstep or two along the way, usually aided by an extra pint at the pub, they work their way into the finals.  Beyond that, you'll have to watch the movie.
But no discussion about Brassed Off would be complete without mentioning the music.  You could find sufficient enjoyment from the music alone.  The soundtrack, performed by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band will appeal to almost everyone.  It's become one of my family's favorite CD's as well.",1055116800,28,2484,4.890476190476191

914612,5,6304707029,"The first thing to say about this absolutely splendid 100-minute film is to completely ignore the write-up and cover photo--both of which give the impression that this is some sort of light, half-baked Hollywood-style romantic comedy.  In fact, it is anything but!
Set in a coal-mining town in the North of England in the early 90s, this is an enlightening and moving British comedy-drama (with the emphasis on drama) centering around the men from the local colliery, whose lives have been turned upside down and forever changed by the decision to close the mine.  The men, their lives, and their relationships with one another are revealed through an interest they have in common--the colliery's brass band.  Now that the mine is closing, the band is likely to be the next casualty.  For one thing, money's tight and the men cannot afford the dues.  But there is one man, Danny (played magnificently by Pete Postlethwaite--Sharpe's Odediah), for whom the band is more than just a casual interest--it's his life, his raison d'etre.  He simply cannot imagine an existence without the band.
This is truly a first-rate film, and as with most British productions, there is not one performance that is anything less than perfect.  The film features Tara Fitzgerald (The Woman in White), a newcomer who joins the band, but unbeknownst to the men is working for management at the mine.  Though the entire cast is wonderful, it is really Postlethwaite, who gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Danny, the band's leader and conductor, that really makes this film sparkle.  And I simply must mention Stephen Tompkinson (Ballykissangel's Father Clifford), who gives an outstanding performance as Phil, Danny's son.
The other thing worth mentioning about this film is the music.  The words ""brass band"" tend to conjur up pictures of marching bands.  What we have here, however, is in essence the brass section of a symphony orchestra.  While there is the odd march performed, by and large the selection of music played are among the most familiar and loveliest of classic pieces--Londonderry Air, Land of Hope and Glory, Rossini's William Tell Overture, and most beautiful of all, Rodrigo's En Aranjuez con tu Amor (what Danny calls the ""orange juice concerto""!).  As for the performance (by an actual colliery band)--it is simply breathtaking.
In conclusion, I highly, highly recommend this well-written and consummately-acted film to anyone looking for quality entertainment.  Certainly, if you've enjoyed other films dealing with the plight of miners or factory workers in the North of England of the last two decades--films like Billy Elliot or The Full Monty, for example--this one's a must see.",1041465600,7,2688,5.149425287356322

Brassed Off is well acted, beautifully scored, and provides a first hand perspective of a Thatcher government, of which few Yanks are aware. We now know why she is ""The Iron Lady.""
As is often the case, we can count on the Brits to understate the obvious. No broad scenic vistas of the Yorkshire countryside. Nevertheless, one immediately gains the feel for Grimley, and its townsfolk, quickly and thoroughly.
The short takes, tight, brief closeups, of facial impressions, demonstate fine editing, and an ensemble of fine actors, though none better than Tara Fitzgerald, an absolute pro, as Gloria Mullins.
Families facing redundancy, and worse, Danny, determined to make it to Albert Hall, all the while suffering from the deadly Black Lung, weave several plots nicely.
A magic moment finds Gloria introduced to Danny and the Band, as she ""dabbles"" with the 2nd movement of Concierto de Aranjuez. If this doesn't move one, then one has no soul.
I take umbrage at the text on the American VHS, indicating the reunion turns the town ""hilariously upside down.""
As Danny indicates in his swan song at Albert Hall, there is little hilarious in the lives of these people, humans, about to be out of work, with little hope for the future.

  The film follows events in the early 90`s cull of the British mining industry, as the Tories kill off an entire industry, and whole communities,behind a facade of `reviews` and `consultation`.
  Pete Postlethwaite takes the lead role as bandleader of Grimethorpe Colliery Brassband, the cultural symbol of dignified and creative struggle in the face of overwhelming opposition. His closing speech at the brassband competition at the Albert Hall is a masterpiece of awakened anger, that surely vindicates Percy Shelley`s `sleeping lion` interpretation of the proletariat in his `The Mask of Anarchy`.
  Stephen Tompkinson is also superb as Postlethwaite`s son,crippled by debt and forced to spend his spare time as a kiddies entertainer. The tragic clown indeed.

1. For an American viewer, it's a good primer on the UK coal industry and the ""changes"" (quotes intended) undertaken to it during Margaret Thatcher's administration.

3. Tara Fitzgerald.  Certainly better here vs. the bizarre setting that was ""Sirens.""  She really looks great in this film.

The mines were the source of not just wealth, but the dignity of entire communities.  Coal mining is a back-breaking, filthy, dangerous and ultimately murderous job, and it was the danger and the sweat that gave the communities their pride.  One of the things that this pride fostered was the incredible virtuosity of the brass bands.  I was never a great fan of brass band music until I saw this movie, but the music in it (played by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, one of the most distinguished bands in the country) is not dull marching music but fantastically intricate and moving stuff.  These guys weren't academy-trained musicians, they were mine workers who learned it in their spare time.
And yet, one of the central points of the film is that we can all sit back and enjoy the music but little was done by anyone but the miners themselves to stop the destruction and demoralisation of the communities that produced it.  That's what gives the film its tragic force, despite the resilience and good humour displayed along the way.  (This is also a funny film, if a very sad one.)
Much of the weight of the tragedy falls on two characters - Danny, the bandmaster, and his son Phil, a trombone player in the band.  Danny is played by Pete Postlethwaite, a stunning actor who seems to able to incarnate an unbelievable range of figures (he was also the sinister Kobayashi in ""The Usual Suspects"" and the dying father in ""In The Name of the Father"").  Postlethwaite's character has been a miner all his life, and his frailty is terribly evident, yet he convinces us with his realisation that the music that he has always loved is, in the end, only the swansong of a whole way of life.
Phil is played by Stephen Tompkinson, who had previously been visible as a good light comedy actor.  Here, his red-eyed, desperate performance is a revelation.  Phil moonlights as a children's entertainer, and the sight of him in clown costume being beaten up by the bailiffs emptying his home is fiercely ironic.
This is a great movie; the point of it is even greater.  The pits were closed down, not because they weren't profitable (most of them were), but because they represented a threat to the new economic order.  The final irony is that, with the closure of so many pits and the drop in fossil fuel consumption, the UK is going to have to build lots of nuclear power stations over the next twenty years if they want to maintain the national electricity grid at its current level.
Having seen the country of my birth (Britain) being systematically despoiled and demoralised over the course of most of my life by a long Conservative administration, I can only cheer a movie like this, which counts the cost of it all.",974246400,29,3145,4.694545454545454

914736,5,6304707029,"I'll bet you don't remember this little gem of a British film at your local cinema...it passed us by quickly and quietly, and I only hope it can have a strong life in video. But the video's cover is just another sign  that the studio just didn't know what to make of this movie or how to  promote it. Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan MacGregor on the cover make it look  like a love story, which is certainly an element of the plot, but one of  many, and certainly not the most important. A British mining town is  threatened with closure of the mines, which will put much of the population  out of work. Unconcerned with this all is Danny (a brilliant Pete  Postlethwaite), the leader of the mine's brass band group, so intent on  winning the national championships that he doesn't see at first the turmoil  as the members of his band face unemployment--including his own son.  There's a triumph at the end, but a bittersweet one, when, at the end,  Danny declares that music doesn't matter...it's people that matter (a sound  bite you probably already recognize--it was sampled at the beginning of  Chumbawamba's hit ""Tubthumping""). The most logical comparable to  this film (and one nearly everyone makes) is ""The Full Monty,""  but this movie came first, and doesn't sacrifice the realities of the  British unemployment problem at the expense of laughs. And if you think you  don't enjoy brass band music, ""Brassed Off"" will go a long way  towards changing your mind--this is *not* oompah-pah-pah music of your  high-school marching band. Music dramatically underscores the lives of the  characters and the tone of the movie. As proof, this movie features one of  the most absolutely gorgeous wordless sequences in contemporary British  film: while the brass band plays an exquisite version of ""En Aranjuez  Con Tu Amor,"" the scene cuts back and forth from their practice to the  breakdown of negotiation talks between the miners and management--a sublime  moment that comes early in the film but sets the scene for many other such  moments. Don't miss this one, and don't let the goofy love-story video  jacket throw you: this is simply one of the best and most bittersweet  British films of recent years.",957571200,105,2201,4.828418230563003

Try living in one of England's former  mining towns before you complain of Brassed Off's political content.
Instead of some fatuous, feel good, pap, we have a highly entertaining,  wonderfully acted, and moving film that has the nerve to carry a message  about how ruthless and uncaring, dictatorial politics affect ordinary  people.
I realise the USA has a major problem with political subtlety  beyond clear cut right wing theory.
Thatcher's politics have  systematically enriched the SE of England at the expense of much of the  rest of the country. Just say this - she is not a 'favourite' personality  for many people outside of London and the commuter belts.
The 1984  miners' strike which saw violence on both sides, has left a long, a very  bitter legacy.

914741,4,6304707029,"An excellent combination of comedy and gritty story telling as focusing on the fortunes of a colliery band as the fight to saved their pit from closure. Pete Postlethwaite shines as the bandleader (more evidence that  the film industry should spend more time on veterans than young stars) and  he's given strong support from the ever-excellent McGregor, Tompkinson and  Fitzgerald. But where as The Full Monty was a feel good tale of workers  overcoming the loss of their jobs, Brassed Off is far more downbeat and  gritty as the miners cling to what remains of their way of life. Director  Mark Herman tells his story convincing with the exception of Tompkinson's  attack on Margaret Thatcher. It has to be said that this was totally  inappropriate in a fictional story and unnecessary, since the film was  already providing an effective comment on the Conservative mining policy of  the 1980s, similar to the way that Ken Loach's Kes commented the state  education of the 1960s. However this is a fairly minor flaw that does not  spoil a film, which is compulsive, funny and moving.",948240000,,1084,4.895604395604396
914806,5,6304707029,"So, why do we do it?  We devote our meager free time to the pursuit of musical excellence, many of us in amateur brass bands, string orchestras, community choirs and the like -- for what purpose?
Because we MUST.  No  matter how dismal or depressed the rest of our lives are, there's always an  opportunity to create something beautiful, something truly magnificent, by  combining our talents with those of others.
The Grimley Colliery Band is  but one example of this.  Each member, all men but one newcomer, is facing  a crisis -- the closing of the coal mine into which they've poured their  sweat and energy for most of their lives, and the uncertain future to  follow.  Their director, Danny, demanding and hard-headed, has retired from  the mine, and doesn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the matter.  ""Music is EVERYTHING!"" he proclaims.  The members consider him  daft, as they struggle to balance family, the impending union/management  show-down, and finances.  It's only at a moment of crisis that they realize  the point:  Danny not only understands the situation, but he also knows  that MUSIC is the only thing that will get these proud men through the  storm together, whole and with some shred of self-respect.
Pete  Postlethwaite is brilliant as Danny; Tara Fitzgerald's understated  performance as Gloria, the only female member of the band, gives her  character a sense of integrity and honor that could easily have been  overlooked in favor of more ""marketable"" characteristics.  The  rest of the cast is remarkable.  Particularly notable is Stephen Tompkinson  as Phil, Danny's son, whose descent into abject depression seems to mirror  the daily descent into the black hole of the coal mine -- dark, dirty, and  dangerous.
I liked this movie far better than I thought I would when I  saw the cover of the DVD.  This is less a romance than an examination of  many lives made complete -- by music, by the pursuit of beauty and grace,  by focused cooperation.

Yes, there's comedy and  there's unquestionably very fine music. But what makes this a great film is  the truth behind it. There are adaptations to make the story into a  screenplay - especially with concessions to the music used and the potrayal  of the band. But what is presented is an accurate impression of what life  for so many has been like in the last two decades. Politics are a heavy  issue in the film, but the comedy and the delivery mean they do not destroy  it. The impact of this film has been destroyed by TFM.

7876069,5,6304707029,"This film about Grimley and its band is loosely based on the experiences of the miners and musicians of Grimethorpe, a small village in South Yorkshire whose economy was heavily dependent on coal mining.  Characters in Brassed Off continue to feel the effects of the 1984 strike that tried and failed to prevent the closure of 20 mines.  The bitterness that arose between those who continued to strike and those who returned to work still remains.  In the period reflected in this movie (1992), most miners were less militant, and were willing to accept mine closure and severance pay,  rather than an assessment of the mines potential profitability as a private venture.  After the mine was closed, Grimethorpe suffered from a loss of jobs and hope.  All of this is reflected in the movie.

The announcement of the mines closing came just days before the 1992 National Brass Band competition.  The fate of the local band after the mine is closed is the central question addressed by the film.  The Grimethorpe Colliery Band (which plays all the music heard in the movie) was one of many sponsored by various British communities and industries, and one of just a small handful of these bands that have been perennial contenders for national honors.  In the years since 1970, the Grimethorpe Colliery Band has won the National Championships 4 times, the ITV Granada Band of the Year title 6 times, and the UK Brass in Concert Championship 14 times.  Its success was partly based on recruitment of such super stars as Alan Morrison (its top cornet player) who was deemed the best lead cornet in Brass in Concert Championships in each of the five years from 1990 to 1994.  (Morrison has said that his only regret in life is that he left the band too early and thus did not appear in the film.)  His successor, Shaun Randall (who plays the cornet solo on William Tell Overture in the movie) was named best lead cornet in the 1995 Brass Concert Championships.  Although the Grimethorpe mine was closed, the Grimethorpe Colliery band has carried on.  In November 2017, one organization ranked it the 10th best brass band in the world.  (The Grimethorpe Colliery Band may be heard on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brassed-Off-Original-Soundtrack-From-The-Miramax-Motion-Picture/dp/B000003G8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brassed Off!: Original Soundtrack From The Miramax Motion Picture</a>.)

Apart from the fate of the band, Brassed Off focuses on the personal situations of a few main characters.  Incredibly, the publisher described the movie as a delightfully entertaining comedy.  This is emphatically not a comedyunless you are inclined to chuckle at families being evicted from their homes, victims of black lung collapsing in the street, or an angry man cursing God in a church.  The film stresses the tension between Danny, the band leader who considers music more important than anything, and his trombonist son Phil, who seems likely to lose everything with the closure of the mine.  There is also the ambiguous romance between Gloria, who has returned to town in a mysterious role, and her old admirer Andy.  Pete Postlewaite (Danny) and Stephen Tompkinson (Phil) are especially convincing.  Tompkinsons role is perhaps the most challenging in the movie.  Tara Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor effectively portray the on-again, off-again, relationship between Gloria and Andy.  (Viewers may recognize Harry as Jim Carter who played the butler Carson in Downton Abbey.)

Although 80 per cent of the miners voted to accept closure of the mine and take severance pay, Brassed Off might lead viewers to sympathize with those who wanted to keep the mine open.  But, work in the mines was not an unmixed blessinglike Danny, many miners suffered from various respiratory diseases.  The movie blames mine closures on Margaret Thatcher and the Tories.  Actually, the reduction in British coal production had been continuous since the 1910s, and cannot be attributed to particular leaders or political parties.  The decline of British manufacturing, the development of new home heating technologies, and the switch to cheaper imported coal and to cleaner and renewable forms of energy were contributing factors.  But, in a broader perspective, the film relates, not just to miners, but to the plight of all workers who are being rendered redundant by modern technology.",1510099200,,4404,5.257510729613734
