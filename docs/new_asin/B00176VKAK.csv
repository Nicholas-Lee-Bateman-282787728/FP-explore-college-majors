8265090,3,B00176VKAK,Mostly forgettable sword and sandal bible movie. Worth a quick watch for the destruction of the the temple. It's kind of funny watching the little miniature dolls falling down.,1497830400,,176,5.103448275862069
8265091,4,B00176VKAK,"I am a student of the Bible.  The book of Judges is one of my favorites.  Both Gideon & Samson were judges of God's people.  This movie allowed me to visualize these 2 judges as enacted out on the screen.  I appreciated seeing this part of the book of Judges come alive.  One discrepancy I noticed was that the angel in the movie spoke to Samson's Father about his birth.  When actually in the Bible the Angel spoke to Samson's Mother 2 times about his birth.
I enjoyed the movie.",1479772800,3,480,4.277777777777778

8265098,3,B00176VKAK,I was glad to get a movie from the book of Judges. This movie was okay but I wish it wasn'[t so Hollywood.,1457481600,2,106,3.652173913043478
