8050962,4,B0007RMNLU,"I thought this DVD was a good ""beginner"" introduction to Ramtha's teachings.  It is not too in depth and is not too long.  I felt like this was a good dvd to purchase and view after having read the information at [...] and then deciding that I wanted more information on these teachings, thoughts, beliefs, etc.  I recommend purchasing and viewing this dvd before you proceed with other dvd, cds, books, etc. of Ramtha's as a lot of the other information just gets more and more ""deep.""",1203897600,,486,4.563218390804598

Ramtha's Address at Seattle Center (November 12, 2004): A Message of Joy and Hope is a 60 minute DVD where JZ Knight (supposedly channeling Ramtha) gives a talk in front of a small room of people. She starts by saying ""(What the Bleep Do We Know!?) is not a promotional film for Ramtha's School of Enlightenment as it is a promotional film of the glory of human beings. Indeed, that which is termed `The Divine' in all of you.""

Apparently filmed on the heels of Bleep's release, popularity, and subsequent criticism from some folks, this opening statement pretty much sets the tone of the lecture. Ramtha's Address at Seattle Center makes a few notable observations based upon some of the ideas in the film, especially the role of neurobiology in creating your reality. Here are some quotes from the DVD:

""The Mind of God equals all the minds that were, are, and ever hope to be throughout all of creation...even the Crab Nebulae.""

""Not extraordinary people, but indeed, common people, are blessed with an ability that lays latent and dormant.""

""People who circumvent life are not dreamers or creators.""

""If your dreams don't come true, you've run into the end of your personality.""

""The doubter isn't a doubter; it just doesn't have any room in the closet. All your emotions are spoken for.""

""If you are sick or ill, you've made yourself sick because of your thoughts.""

Theories connecting the role of thoughts to illness are not new. Louise Hay has written several books on the topic (such as You Can Heal Your Life), and medical intuitives like Caroline Myss have also addressed the energetic connection between thoughts, energy, and illness. JZ/Ramtha, when speaking, seems to string together general ideas and commentary but with no obvious point. Half the time, her fake accent breaks down until she catches herself and then resumes the theatrics...theatrics like talking of the ""little film"" What the Bleep and how it wasn't one of her ""best roles"".

One of her last comments is perhaps the most telling:

""My school is not a cult. That is a dirty 4-letter word you call people you don't like or understand and it would take a LOT to understand me. I mean, you'd have to THINK... Our school teaches fantastical knowledge...""

She then goes on to boast that a CIA agent confided to her that they used Ramtha's tapes for training agents involved in government remote viewing projects (Project Stargate before it disbanded in 1995 I assume?) because Ramtha's the ""real deal"". She also bragged that one of her students can bi-locate.

I never agreed with reviews that said What the Bleep Do We Know was a promo film for RSE. Heck, I didn't even know who the blonde woman was in the movie until after the fact! Moreover, I certainly didn't get the feeling that the directors/writers were pushing some sinister Ramthian agenda, especially since JZ is only in a small portion of the film.

Yet, with the flurry of related DVD's coming out from several individuals featured in Bleep (all of whom are Ramtha's students), I can't help but wonder if someone is now trying to milk the Bleep cash cow...

While there are a few good comments in this DVD, most of it seems like theatrical fluff. If you want to know more about neurobiology, get Molecules of Emotion by Candace Pert. If you want to learn about creating your day using the frontal lobe of your brain, get Dr. Joe Dispenza's Your Immortal Brain: Mastering the Art of Observation. Because, quite frankly, there's not a whole lot in Ramtha's Address at Seattle Center-and certainly no message of hope or joy that I could detect.

(Note: I gave both What the Bleep and Ramtha's Create Your Day 5 stars. However, I had to give my honest opinion of this DVD...and so I did.)",1130457600,20,3944,4.76099706744868
8050965,5,B0007RMNLU,"This is a rare public appearance by Ramtha the Enlightened One, as channelled through JZ Knight at the Seattle Center. The entire address is an inspiring message of joy and hope, as Ramtha explains our connection to the Divine, and that with knowledge and training, we the common people can use our Divinity to create beautiful realities.

I was very fortunate to attend this address live, and each time I watch the DVD I am more inspired and uplifted with the message that all of us are blessed with the ability to collapse any reality we choose into being. I found every sentence in this DVD to be packed with rich information, leaving me with much to contemplate and consider.

Referring to the film 'What The Bleep' in which Ramtha was featured, he refers to Dr Emoto's proven facts about water to further explain how our attitudes and thinking create our everyday reality.

""Do you think that you have to be a Tibetan Monk to change the crystalline nature of water? Every time you pour yourself a goblet of water, the water changes according to your attitude and energy. But what if you had trained your mind to be sterling and you had the capacity to change that water from mere tap water or lifeless bottled water, into water that is formed as an elixir that indeed when you drink it, it does something to you? Because now your mind is in the water.""

Ramtha gives a brief but fascinating outline of his school in Yelm, south of Seattle, where his students come from all over the world to study mind. From his outline it is obvious that the students are experiencing the extraordinary, and he gives examples of particular students; what they have achieved as they gain knowledge and training, and as they work with the Divine within themselves. This is absolutely worth viewing, to gain an understanding of latent potentials that are within all of us, and that there are people in Ramtha's school who are developing and using these potentials.

Here is a brief portion of the outline ~

""Our school, and it is a school, is about a collection of worldwide entities from all elsewheres who have come to study not the nature of God in the abstract of God that is out there, or indeed God of that which is termed culture and religion, and religion is just the study of the nature of God, it didn't create God. But the students who have come, are coming to find it in them. To find not a devoutness, not a holiness of inordinate law that prevents the beauteous nature of who you are from being, you are beautiful! But to find in you that reason and that connection to the Divine. And how does it work? How does your mind work? If you are the Observer that can collapse any reality into being, the only information you need is knowledge, and training, and if you have knowledge and training you can dream beautiful realities and so they will come"".

Ramtha was featured in the film What The Bleep, which he describes as a promotional film about the glory of human beings. This film fits hand in glove with A Message of Joy and Hope. Another title I found well worth reading that contains plenty of scientifically proven techniques and facts on how we create our reality is The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy. Dr Emoto's research and study into water is titled The Hidden Messages in Water, where he graphically delivers facts and results of peoples' thoughts affecting the molecular structure of water.

I have found all of these titles to be rich in information and inspiration, as they have helped me build the solid understanding that I and everyone else have extraordinary potentials waiting to be tapped, and as science and research has clearly proven, dreams can and do come true!

The beauty of A Message of Joy and Hope is, that it is a rare, public live address by Ramtha, where the simple powerful genius of the Master is very apparent throughout.",1129680000,11,3876,4.597684515195369
8050966,5,B0007RMNLU,"I was very curious after seeing the movie What the Bleep, who was that blonde woman in the movie called Ramtha? I did some research and found there was a workshop from his school near where I live. It was only $250 for the weekend, with the first night free, so I said, hey, what the heck, let's find out and see. A while ago I stopped asking my friends about new movies I wanted to see. Most of the time I find they were wrong. I make it a rule to find out for myself first. So I went, and I was really impressed.

First of all, there was no cult thing, weird stuff going on, pyramids on your head or strange clothes, etc., as some critics keep saying. What I found was, right at the start of the session, they had us in the audience try out some remote-viewing with each other. Simple things we draw on a piece of paper and the person next to us has to know what we draw without seeing, and then take turns. Well, you are not going to believe me, but a huge amount of people were able to do it exactly right. This is way cool. I got it right, of course! I did not know I could do this. I thought this was only something out of the x-files, or something like that. If you ask me, finding this out about myself, and learning some really simple techniques to practice this on my own was well worth the money and the time going to this RSE workshop. I am having fun with this thing. I am trying to remote-view what my boyfriend is really thinking! Ha.

The other thing I wanted to share here is this scientific paper we got at the workshop with information about some scientific testing they did on Ramtha that got published by the scientists in The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, a trustworthy society founded in 1885, so it is the real deal as far as science goes.

This is what the scientists were saying about Ramtha, check it out:

""JZ Knight, who had been channeling Ramtha the Enlightened One, a spiritual teacher for the previous twenty years, `is not a fraud,' According to Dr. Stanley Krippner, a psychologist and the leading parapsychology researcher in the U.S. who rigorously tested Knight at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) in Yelm over a period of 18 months.""

"" `She's not faking it,' added Ian Wickramasekera of San Francisco's Saybrook Institute of Graduate Studies, `because when we hooked her up to test her physiological responses, we got results which could not have been manipulated.' According to Wickramasekera, when Knight left her body and Ramtha took over, the heart rate hit a low of 40 beats per minute and then raced to 180 beats per minute. In her normal resting state, Knight's heart rate was between 85 and 90.""

""According to conference organizer Gordon Melton, Wickramasekera was initially not interested in being involved in the study and did not expect to come up with such significant results.  `You might see this in someone who is jogging or having a serious panic attack, but at the time Ms. Knight was sitting completely still,' said Wickramasekera, who used state-of-the-art equipment to test Knight. He conducted the physiological tests three times and the results were consistent in all three runs. `Science demands repeatability and Ms. Knight allowed us to perform these tests three times.' ""

""Wickramasekera explained how eight standardized, physiological, psychological, and behavioral tests were administered. `When you go fishing you use a big net,' Wickramasekera said. `What we didn't expect was to find fish in all eight nets.' The results of the physiological tests showed that when Knight is channeling Ramtha, her muscle tension, pulse, and galvanic skin response increase while skin temperature and blood volume both decrease. Wickramasekera affirmed that Knight could not have voluntarily changed or faked all eight of these results.""

I must say that seeing the Ramtha DVDs, Create Your Day, Cracking the Code to the Extraordinary, and A Message of Joy, now make a lot more sense to me after I went to the workshop and learned my natural talent as a remote-viewer (smile). Some of the things Ramtha says there may seem too simple and nothing new, but when you put them into practice with the simple techniques and instructions I got there over the weekend, now I understand the value and how far reaching and applicable they are to my life everyday. And I can do this in my own time, in the privacy of my own home, without having to go anywhere else. If you are interested in finding out some really cool, sci-fi stuff we can do with our brain and our mind, check this out. You may like it as I surprisingly did!",1116028800,29,4604,4.625458996328029
