3960057,3,B002NTDXNC,"It's not on par with the movies, but it's okay. The actually voice actors from the movies would have added some value to it. I also wish they had not censored the episodes.",1266278400,,172,4.242424242424242
3960058,5,B002NTDXNC,A Christmas gift for my son.  Very please with the quality and prompt delivery.,1265241600,,79,4.642857142857143
3960059,4,B002NTDXNC,"Don't know why more black films aren't turned into cartoons! This could have easily been a Saturday morning cartoon for adults lol. Even though the actual actors from the movies weren't involved, all the voices were still good. I just wish more episodes we're created but hey some is better than none. I would recommend to any true Friday fan.",1260489600,,343,4.733333333333333
3960060,4,B002NTDXNC,I absolutely loved Friday so it's only natural that I heart the cartoon! The show wasn't on Mtv long and I don't know why?? All the characters were fairly on point and they even snuck in some fan fav's such as Pinky and Money Mike! This will make a great stocking stuffer for my Dad who is a huge Friday fan.,1260489600,,308,4.065573770491803

3960072,5,B002NTDXNC,Very fun. Loved the new character big Mary. Lol. The characters weren't voice overed by the original chracters of the movie and they didn't look like them either. That was kind of a let down. But the neighborhood antics were good.,1379548800,,230,4.634146341463414
3960073,5,B002NTDXNC,"Well here I am again wondering why something as good as this got canceled, I simply do not understand! It was a show that came on MTV a channel that prides itself on being hip,now and in well this show is all of that and funny as hell I guarantee you will be picking yourself up off the floor after just the first episode ""hardly working "" the animation is excellent with all the characters looking funny and just believable enough,(if u do decide to get this b sure to look in the background there is a lot of cool and funny stuff going on!) The humor is right on time placed expertly at key moments, just flat out funny for all people there's some cussing but nothing too bad, sound is excellent loud and clear, it is a great product, if you haven't seen the movies do yourself a favor and get them as this is a direct continuation of them you may find this even funnier the truly sad part is I won't be able to see anymore episodes I would have followed this to season 10!!  Report card: condition A+  arrival time A+++  case and disc A+  get this!!!",1376524800,3,1053,4.198019801980198
3960074,3,B002NTDXNC,"The DVD arrived in good time and brand new as stated in the description but it would skip and stall throughout the DVD. I emailed the marketplace I purchased it from but I was ignored, so I won't buy from them again.",1376265600,,216,4.166666666666667
3960075,5,B002NTDXNC,"I love Christ Tucker and Ice Cube from the original movie Friday.  Therefore, I wanted to show my support to this cartoon series which I enjoyed as well.  I am in school and doing homework can be rather intense.  I put on this CD and it really helped me to relax and not be so tense while studying.  Thank!",1359763200,,306,4.135593220338983
3960076,3,B002NTDXNC,Some of the cartoon were funny and some was weak. Overall the cd was pretty good to have. Still worth buying and putting in your dvd collection.,1356048000,,144,4.37037037037037
3960077,5,B002NTDXNC,"I don't even remember how I found out about this DVD, but glad I did. It included glimpses of characters from all of the sequels, but not too much.",1347667200,,147,4.103448275862069
3960078,5,B002NTDXNC,Though these guys have different voices they still sound good..as if their voice is animated as well but it is very funny!! different than the movie but its still a great comic!!,1343520000,,178,4.59375
3960079,4,B002NTDXNC,I had the opportunity to watch this series with my mother last year during the Thanksgiving holiday. We could not stop watching it over and over again. I know all of the voices are not authentic to the actual movie but it is still worth watching. I definitely enjoyed myself enough that I purchased two copies one for my mother and one for myself. Now I can watch it whenever I want to.,1322611200,5,386,4.301369863013699
3960080,5,B002NTDXNC,"I didn't even know this DVD existed! No, it doesn't have the voices of the original characters, but it captures the characters well. I purchased one for myself and one for a family member. We can't stop watching it!",1281312000,4,215,4.538461538461538
