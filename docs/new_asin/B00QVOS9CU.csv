8693113,1,B00QVOS9CU,"this was so boring, we all fell asleep watching it. maybe someone who is very well educated about the CIA and what they do would be semi interested in this, but for the regular viewer this is really just a history about a plane they tried building to fly over russia that russia wouldn't be able to see by satellite. i found it hard to believe that that is all they did in area 51. there must be more to the story. would not recommend!",1439164800,,435,4.129411764705883
