5408796,1,B00ABA1OP4,"I can watch the EU version, the video quality is very bad, worst blu-ray I ever seen.
DVD's upscaled looks better.
Only last 3 videos have decent quality ""Main Land"" and both verions of ""Mein Herz Brennt""
""Pussy"" is the censored version
Some people receive their pack with two equal disk insted Disc 1 and Disc 2.

5408797,3,B00ABA1OP4,I was wondering what the difference between this and the MiG box set is. I have all of the videos and the Making of .. videos on there....It came with a booklet and was told that is the same booklet that will be in this set. BTW my MiG box set rusted away and I did care for it. Being in FL it rusted anyway :(,1356480000,5,310,3.712121212121212
5408798,4,B00ABA1OP4,"Now that the collection has actually been released to the states, and I've watched most of it (still working on the making of videos)...

I have the Blu-ray version.  Not sure what if any differences there are quality wise for the DVD version vs the Blu-ray.

TL:DR Version
Video's are great, but mostly SD, only the last 3 are HD.
Sound is great, but only 2.1 stereo (sub-woofer will rock your house if you got a good powered one).
Making of's are a lot of fun.
Quality of product is great.  If only the videos had been remastered this would have been a 6 out of 5 star product.

DETAILS:

The Menu:
Great ambiance.  Screen looks crisp and clean.  Style is very dark (visually and audibly).  I am enjoying the low tones playing right now and I could sleep very happily to this for hours.  Menus are effective and responsive.

The Videos:
As many have mentioned, the videos resolution is NOT blu-ray quality.  I'll admit I feel like they could have pumped a bit of $$ into remastering the videos, but in the end for what I wanted this isn't that bad.  Mein Land and both Mein Hertz Brennt videos are clearly higher resolutions, and by the time I got to them (last three videos) I had almost forgotten how non-HD the videos were.  Sadly this ended up being a reminder of what the whole collection COULD have looked like, assuming the original source materials were available.  IMHO this cost the collection 1 star because it's not the quality I expected from such an epic band, but it's also not a deal breaker for me, nor does it stop me from greatly enjoying the discs.

The Censorship:
P*ssy was a very well censored video.  Sure I've seen the full on pornographic version and would have preferred it, but I was highly pleased to NOT see the massive red ""heat sensor""-censored version.  An EXCELLENT compromise.
Considering the amount of boobs and sexual innuendo present, I'm not sure why some things got edited (such as the bikini-clad chicks in ""Keine Lust"" with flame throwers that apparently got edited out, but were still in the ""Making of"" video)
Seems the main things edited out were below-the-belt genitals.

The Audio:
Whine whine whine!  Oh noes, it's ""stereo"" instead of 5.1 surround.  Whoopitydoo!  The sound quality on every video was amazing.  I put my receiver to ""straight"" meaning it doesn't apply any filters or equalizers so you get whatever sound the disc provides the player with.  This cut my rear (satellite) speakers and my center.  Truth be told: I didn't notice this at first, as the sound quality was crisp and clean, and my subwoofer was tearing up my walls and shaking my couch.  I finally noticed that Till's voice was coming mostly from the right of the screen (because I was sitting closer to that speaker) at which point I looked and saw that my receiver was only getting a signal for L/R/Sub channels.  I kicked it over to ""5-chanel Stereo"" which tends to make stereo feel fuller and act as if it were 5.1, but it didn't sound BETTER to me, so I switched it back.
Honestly, the music isn't recorded for surround sound, and I fail to see how you'd gain that much from it.  Why stop at 5.1?  Why not 7.1? 7.2? Hell, what about 9.2?  The quality is great, and made me feel like I was at one of their concerts.

Overall:
Great buy, though the only reason I can think of to buy the Blu-ray over the DVD is that you get the videos on 2 discs instead of 1.
Cover is great, pack is slick.  It's far from ""perfect"" video wise, but I'm very pleased with the product.  I'd love to watch the DVD version to see if the claim that ""upscaled DVD looks better than Blu-ray"" is at all accurate, but I'm not about to buy a DVD copy to find out. (unless maybe I opt to buy a copy for a friend)

Making Of:
Only watched a few, and so far they are pretty great.  Love these guys.  Only disappointment so far was Mann Gegen Mann.  I had never seen that video before and by God it was quite homo-erotic.  Lots of near-naked men in a sea of man-flesh oiled and rubbing on each other gropingly.  Didn't bother me much, but since I had always heard the translation was ""Man Vs. Man"" (apparently it's ""Man against Man"" as in physically pressed against each other) I was caught off guard and hoped that the Making of video would enlighten me.  It was just the director saying he knew just what he wanted to do for the video, and how honored he was to make a Rammstein video, and how amazing the band is, and how amazing all their videos are.  Not once did any band member comment on the video.  Didn't even explain why he did what he did with the video.
Rest have been great so far.",1354752000,19,4591,4.410225921521998

5408804,5,B00ABA1OP4,"Love everything about this starting with the cover.  Was thinking ""just Paul on the cover?""  Maybe they'd made different covers with each of them & I got Paul, no prob - Paul's awesome!  Later I saw it and wondered how I thought that was Paul when it's obviously Ollie.

5408806,5,B00ABA1OP4,"Blu-Ray version.
Videos in 4X3 (2 older, which was expected): Du Riechst So Gut, Seemann, Mann Gegen Mann.
Odd Widescreen: Rammstein... which is odd, since I thought it was 4X3 Widescreen (like older dvd's used to do), but it's slightly wider, but not 16X9.
All others are 16X9.
Newer videos obviously look better, but the older ones are about the same as my collection on dvd.
'Making of videos' vignettes are interesting.  Lots of interviews with band and directors.
Menu is definately better than the Lichtspielhaus dvd.
One NC-17 video... tamer than the one I originally saw.",1447200000,,579,4.969072164948454

Includes all of their music videos from 1995 - 2012, all of them also have a making of video and/or interviews with the band and directors. The only problem I encountered(and it is a tiny problem) is that disc one doesn't like to stay in place in the case. It was loose in the case but not scratched in any way, it still likes to come out every now and again. But that is a trivial flaw.",1440374400,,489,4.268817204301075
5408813,4,B00ABA1OP4,"Great band and videos. I assumed they would be enhanced to high def....not the case with earlier videos especially.  The creative, artistic and often homoerotic over/undertones make this band so far ahead of their time.",1436572800,,219,5.257142857142857

5408819,5,B00ABA1OP4,"Okay, obviously one has to be kind of a fanatic to buy any musical group's ""videos""... most videos are monotonous, slapdash, and not terribly ""narrative"". Rammstein from video one knew visual was important and used their varying physical appearances, incorporating personas to match. Some of the early vids you can see the grain, but it was the late 90s and things have progressed technically. Sound quality (on Blu-Ray) is fantastic. And I honestly did not want to open the wrapper, as the packaging for this collection is handsome as well as clever ( the ""we're all one"" credo plainly evident right up front). Anyone with impressionable kids might want to keep ""Pussy"" away from them, as it's graphic as can be without actual money shots. It's also hilarious for those of us who've watched a bad porno or several. The Jonas Aukerland stuff is funny, a bit shocking even now, and he obviously loves working with Rammstein. For those of us who have a favorite member of the band, it is especially great to see some of the hair dos and don'ts, the fashion catastrophes, and physical changes. ""Keine Lust"" addresses the eventual ""old rock star"" thing... but it was also  when Till Lindemann's health was not good, and the lyrics to the song aren't funny at all. Finally : if you are a Rammstein fan, or know someone who is, this is a sure bet. Ich liebe Rammstein. Fur immer !",1430956800,5,1374,4.677685950413223

I love how every video has a story behind it and that so much thought and hard work went into making them.  I saw the video for p**** here for the first time.  Why are people making a big deal about this? I'm a woman, and let me tell you something, I was not offended one bit! Funniest video ever if you ask me. I felt it had a certain charm to it. :)  And the cover of Depeche mode's Stripped? Gorgeous!! Stunning!! Anyway, this collection is beautifully packaged in a holographic case and includes a very nice booklet. 3 DVDs!! I am in heaven!!!

5408825,5,B00ABA1OP4,"This collection is amazing for the price.  Everything- the videos, the making ofs, the sound quality of the music, the interviews- is of very high quality.
There are three discs worth of videos, all their greatest songs, and all but one entry has a ""making of"" to accompany it.  Though the band members often seem a bit confounded about what a given video is meant to convey, especially with the early ones, each guy has insightful comments about the art of what they are doing and what it means to them to be a band, and an internationally respected one at that.  Their output was initially very controversial in Germany at the beginning, members commenting that they were either loved or hated in their own country while the rest of the world was much more accepting of them.  You see the evolution of Rammstein as a band not even sure what it was they wished to be at the start into a strong and confident enterprise as they found their identity, voice and audience.  All the videos are emotionally charged, the acted and/or abstract ones as well the ones featuring concert footage (and in one case movie footage, from David Lynch's Lost Highway- the story of how the band came into contact with Lynch is interesting and funny).  Buy it for the music or buy it for the art, but buy it.  You don't get value for the money very often these days.",1418428800,2,1346,4.51440329218107

The behind the scenes interviews give terrific glimpses into not only how the videos were made, but also the band's mindset when they made them. I wish the 'Pussy' video had been uncensored, but heaven forbid adults be allowed to make such decisions for themselves. Overall, a terrific collection.",1409097600,,345,5.178571428571429
5408830,4,B00ABA1OP4,"I wasn't expecting great visual quality on their earlier videos, but even the newer stuff isn't quite up to snuff for blu-ray.  It should also be noted that you get a different version of the Pussy video that cuts out the more graphic shots.",1403136000,,241,4.4772727272727275

5408839,5,B00ABA1OP4,"I have been a fan since their release of the album sehnsucht. There is little I don't enjoy from this band.
I live in america, so my knowledge of rammstein extends only to what I hear on their albums. Their music videos are an extreme rarity in the us, blocked on youtube for copyright reasons, only avaliable outside the usa, blah blah blah. So this collection was the first time I was able to view alot of this content! I truly enjoyed almost every video on this collection! Rosenrot, du hast, ich will, and Amerika all stood out very much from the rest. Almost each video is a story that goes along with the song, enhancing my appreciation for their music.
Then on top of this great collection you have behind the scenes video, which contains alot of information, about not only the music videos but the band as well as some very revealing commentary from the band themselves.

Rammstein in my opinion puts any american band to shame, they are simply one of the best metal/industrial bands in the world.

This is a must have for any Rammstein fan.",1388620800,,1050,4.521052631578947

I actually watched them on a 110"" projector screen and it's all the better to see all the band members more life like this way...hehe. Funny videos and well done videos. Some videos not so good in the pixelation department  - atleast on DVD version and projector - played on a PS3 with 1080p Epson 6020 projector.",1388448000,,549,4.228571428571429

Not only do you receive all 25 of Rammsteins' music videos, but you also get behind the scenes/making of videos for all of the music videos! Rammsteins' music videos are incredible on their own, I cannot think of any other artist/band that puts more thought into their music videos than Rammstein does, and when you watch the ""making of"" segments that accompany each video, you get to see firsthand how much work really goes into making every video. What is also amazing about the ""making of"" segments is that they feature interviews/comments from the members of Rammstein (Till Lindemann, Richard Kruspe, Paul Landers, Oliver Riedel, Christoph Schneider and Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz), they give so much inside information it is incredible, from the time the band released their debut album Herzeleid up until their most recent album Liebe Ist F&uuml;r Alle Da (as well as their Made in Germany: 1995-2012 greatest hits cd), the various members of the band discuss everything you can think of (I don't want to give everything away, but trust me, anything you ever wanted to know about how songs were thought up, created, made into videos, and everything in between is included)!

This disc has all their videos...even the newest ones.  And there's behind the scenes/making of selections for each video.  I even managed to watch all of those, thanks to the subtitles.  It's interesting to get to hear from the band...because they kind of fly under the radar.

Rammstein makes the best videos...and they are the best live show you will ever see!",1376179200,4,507,4.5777777777777775

5408854,5,B00ABA1OP4,"This Blu-ray set is a great way to relive all your favorites, and see some fantastic new stuff too.  Til and the boys prove once again why they've had the staying power to outlive so many of their peers.  Still touring AND putting out new material throughout a career that has spanned two decades of awesome, face-melting rock.  Who cares if you don't speak German...  their power and artistry translate and transcend.

You will dig this video collection.

5408856,5,B00ABA1OP4,"This is a great 3 DVD set of all (as far as I know) Rammstein videos.  I might take off 1/2 star, if I could, because the labeling on DVD 1 and 2 are reversed,so the videos on DVD1 are the songs listed as being on DVD2 and vice versa.  I even managed to enjoy the ""Making of..."" which I usually don't bother with, but they did have subtitles.  You will, however, have to plan watching all of them when you have about 4 1/2 hours of free time.  If you already have ""Lichtspielhaus"", then you can skip the first DVD and first 2 songs on DVD2,unless you just want to watch ""The Making of..."".  It also comes with a very good photo-booklet.",1368316800,13,636,4.138211382113822

5408865,5,B00ABA1OP4,"I already had Lichtspielhaus, the previous Rammstein music video collection, but it ended at the Mutter era. It also lacked ""Making Of"" documentaries for most of the videos. This set has all of their current videos, and a documentary for each one. Unlike Lichtspielhaus, it contains no other features, just the music videos and documentaries, no live performances or promos spots.

Also, don't be alarmed if one of the DVDs fell out of the holder during shipping, it shouldn't be scratched, if it is, return it and hope for the best.",1364083200,,533,4.857142857142857

8549730,5,B00ABA1OP4,"Any fan knows that strange, provocative visuals are part of the Rammstein experience. This DVD, which collects all of Rammstein's music videos + the making of said videos, shows the growth of the band. All of the videos are in lush HD, which makes some of the early videos look hilariously dated (what even is happening in Seeman?).

Yes, you can view everything on this DVD on Youtube, but this is a damn fine DVD. I've yet to buy a Rammstein boxset that didn't blow me away with the creativity and care put into it, from packaging to content. The video and sound quality is excellent.

The ""Making Of"" are fun and informative. Some of them focus solely on the director (""Mann Gegan Mann"", for example) which is a bit disappointing. Others are filmed as interviews with a few members of the band reflecting on the creation of the video. Personally, I always enjoy watching the making of ""Mein Teil"", ""Mein Land"", and ""Mein Herz Brennt.""

Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD for any Rammstein fan.",1506643200,,1004,4.661016949152542
