8030302,5,B0002PYS1K,Amazing resource. Best place to start and go rockstar instantly! Look nowhere else!,1411862400,,83,5.461538461538462
8030303,5,B0002PYS1K,"I've been playing blues guitar and mandolin for over 50 years, but I'm a complete beginner on the fiddle, having taken just about a dozen lessons to get some idea of basic technique. I've owned an inexpensive fiddle since 1972, but hadn't played it since 1973.

I enjoy Anger's approach, and his comments on various aspects of the fiddle as a blues instrument have been quite helpful. I don't find the ""riff blues"" examples particularly interesting as music, but they work okay for illustrating techniques. I tend to learn mostly by ear, but the accompanying notation can be very helpful when you can't quite figure out what's going on. That's not real common in this video, though, since Anger's comments are fairly detailed.

The quality is excellent, as are most instructional videos produced by the Traum brothers. As with guitar and mandolin workshops, I find instructional DVDs mostly inspirational. At least I can go back to the DVDs for review as often as needed.",1386720000,3,971,4.914634146341464
8030304,5,B0002PYS1K,"Darol is an amazing player and instructor. I've seen him live once, and it inspired me to purchase this DVD method. I'm not disappointed at all. Buy it.",1382659200,,152,4.464285714285714
8030305,5,B0002PYS1K,It is just what I wanted and fully meets my expectations.  I am enjoying it very much and I thank you.,1356220800,,102,3.857142857142857
8030306,5,B0002PYS1K,"This is the kind of instruction I like.  Like others have said, it's a bit advanced, not for a raw beginner, but if you can play the violin or fiddle at all and have some clue where the notes are and what scales are, then you shouldn't have any problem with this.

Like another reviewer said, this is mainly licks and riffs, although he does show and play with guitar accompiment ""complete blues progressions"", so in a sense he does do ""complete songs"".  But they are fairly short, and the idea is to take off from these basics and build from them.  He also gives some great tips on how to practice and learn to do quick tranpositions, and he also shows in some depth a really great technique for ""blues vibrato"".

I'm very happy with the video, if I glean all I can from this it will be well worth the price and a great deal more.  In fact, there's enough material in here to keep me busy for months, if not a full year, so you do the math when comparing this with the price of a live teacher for the same amount of lessons.",1267142400,15,1025,4.177664974619289
8030307,5,B0002PYS1K,This is a great DVD for learning Blues licks used in Bluegrass. Not for beginners!! This was very helpful in learning blues slide licks.,1227657600,10,136,4.708333333333333
8030308,5,B0002PYS1K,"This is one of the more useful instructional dvd's I've seen.  He doesn't take whole songs and lay them out note by note.  Instead he lays out different chops that can be incorporated into other songs.  And blues can be a whole lot of chops, so it works.

I personally like learning components that I can improvise into something I'm doing, rather than learning someone else's rendition of a song note by note.

His sort of smirky demeanor at first made me think he was a bit uncomfortable in his role, but he's an excellent player, and has a feel for the genre.

There is some stuff on here that is accessible to the advanced beginner, but when he starts climbing into second and third position, it left me behind.

I've also ordered his ""Chops and Licks"" dvd.",1132963200,23,761,4.471014492753623
