8374858,5,B002N8AQPQ,"Urban Exploration: (from Wikipedia) the exploration of man-made structures, usually abandoned ruins or not usually seen components of the man-made environment. Photography and historical interest/documentation are heavily featured in the hobby and, although it may sometimes involve trespassing onto private property, this is not always the case and is of innocent intention.  The nature of this activity presents various risks, including both physical danger and the possibility of arrest and punishment.

Sounds like just another Saturday night, right?  Wrong.  Kids, do not try this at home.  Even though it sounds adventurous and fun, there is a lot of danger involved from faulty building structure to not knowing who else might be exploring the building with you, whether it be friend or foe.  Therefore, if you are like me and are too chicken to do this yourself, this is the DVD for you.

Brian Cano and Chris Mancuso are veterans of urban exploration; they have been doing this for years.  Fortunately for us, they brought cameras with them and have made their many adventures available to the public to enjoy.  This is the first DVD I bought of their episodes and I was instantly hooked.  The excitement loving part of me would love to go and explore old scary buildings at night, but the practical part of me wants to keep on living, so I prefer watching their exploits as they explore old abandoned, sometimes gigantic, structures and as they say, All the events are real, all the danger is real, and all the fear is real.  This is the REAL deal.  I truly fear for them as they enter toxic and dangerous places where one wrong step could be your last, or where they meet other people in the dark, some just exploring and partying and some with a more sinister agenda.  They have encountered toxic mold and asbestos, had to put out fires set by pyromaniacs, and have gotten lost in the never-ending halls and tunnels they travel though to reach certain destinations.  This particular DVD of Danvers Mental Institution is an example of an abandoned structure that was eventually renovated into condominiums, but there are several other examples of buildings they have explored that are no longer there.  Their films are basically historical documents of beautiful structures that have either been torn down or restructured.  So you won't see them this way again folks.

Another interest of the SCARED! Crew is paranormal investigation, so sometimes the urban exploration and paranormal investigation go hand in hand.  They have just enough skepticism to keep it real, so there will be no faking here guys.  Brian, Chris, and a host of others make these DVDs fun, interesting, and educational.  I highly recommend them for all those who are curious in nature and who love adventure.  You will not be disappointed.",1393113600,,2822,4.974413646055437
