5178160,4,B008PALI5S,"Having been present for the Mahler cycle that occupied Los Angeles and Gustavo Dudamel and the LA Phil as well as the Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela at the beginning of this year and was immediately followed by all troops descending on Caracas Venezuela for an instant replay of that cycle, it is interesting to see the difference in approach between the two cities.  When Dudamel and masses performed the Mahler 8th at the grossly ugly and acoustically dreadful Shrine Auditorium in Los Angles the performance sounded under rehearsed and loud and uneven on the part of both the orchestras and the massive choruses and the soloists. It is nice to report that this performance in Caracas that was broadcast in movie theaters across the country is a better version than the disappointing Los Angeles version.

The DVD captures a travelogue type atmosphere of the performance and the visual aspects of the production are acceptable.  Everything is big and oversized and again under rehearsed, but the mighty choral forces are the Coro Sinf&oacute;nico Juvenil Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var de Venezuela, Schola Cantorum de Venezuela, Schola Juvenil de Venezuela and the Ni&ntilde;os Cantores de Venezuela show a lot of enthusiasm if not refinement. The soloists are the same mixed bag from the Los Angeles performance - Manuela Uhl, Julianna Di Giacomo, Anna Larsson, Charlotte Hellekant, Burkhard Fritz, Brian Mulligan, Alexander Vinogradov, and Kiera Duffy.

This is not a definitive performance or a particularly insightful one: Dudamel seems to have solid ideas but it will take more than two performances of this huge work to bring it all together. Hopefully when he repeats it in the future he will not assemble the `symphony of 1000 +' that we see and hear on this very PR oriented DVD. Simply a well rehearsed, polished, dramatic performance with much smaller forces would likely allow Dudamel to realize his approach to the work. On the DVD, at the end of the performance, there is a lengthy `insight' talk with Dudamel and samples from both orchestras that serve to amplify and to polish the popularity of the event for the public.  The concept was solid; the results make a great show, but a great Mahler 8 this is not.  Grady Harp, September 12",1348704000,12,2280,5.066666666666666

5178167,4,B008PALI5S,"If the unfortunate performances of the soloists can be overlooked, which is quite difficult at times, Dudamel's Malher 8 is one of the most moving versions available. Nothing in Dudamel's interpretation is intellectually or emotionally false. Even the soloists feel Dudamel's passion for Mahler's passion. If only they could consistently hit and hold the notes.

In praise, however, it ends in the joy of triumph over nothingness Mahler had to believe was still possible; we see and hear that the children feel it too. We want to believe them... but are some among the thousand more skeptical? Dudamel lets Mahler let us decide for ourselves.",1402876800,,642,5.114285714285714

5178172,5,B008PALI5S,"Mahler's Symphony Nr. 8 E-Flat Major would have to be the most mammoth undertaking in symphonic history.
I have many versions of this work in all formats and love them all, but; this reading by Dudamel and his combined LA & Venezuelan forces would have to be the definitive version to date!
Not only has he assembled the largest forces to EVER to tackle this work, but has been able to bring the whole work home with exhilarating results; fresh, clean and decisive articulation. Every note down to the quietest pianissimo can actually be heard in this recording; most other recordings you cannot hear these softer passages.
The choirs, all Venezuelan handle the massive work with ease and I must make mention of the massive children's choir who perform this work from memory: NO SCORES, what so ever. How the hell they managed it is beyond me and shows just what kind of choristers they are and my hat goes off to them.
Then we come to the soloists: Eight of the most perfect voices I have ever heard. The only one I know is the alto Anna Larsson the remainder are completely unknown to me; but what voices they poses. The three sopranos are: Manuela Uhl; Juliana di Giacomo and Kiera Duffy: the two altos are Anna Larsson and  Charlotte hellekant: the men are: Burkhard Fritz (tenor), Brain Mulligan (baritone), Alexander Vinogradov (bass).
Alexander would have to the youngest bass I have ever heard in part and what a magnificent powerful voice he possesses. ALL the soloists are exemplary.
The combined orchestras play with so much passion you can almost feel the music oozing from the very beings and all this held in the most capable hands of just ONE man, Gustavo Dudamel.
So!! If you like me have many recordings of Mahler's ""Symphony of a Thousand"" but NOT this one; go out and purchase it, I can tell you now, you'll never listen to your other ones again once your ears have experienced this.
Passionate, explosive, and sonically majestic don't even begin to describe it.
Do yourself a favour and experience what I felt when I played this Blu-Ray performance. You only live once and you will only witness once Mahler at his VERY, VERY best. Mahler vs Dudamel, the fight is not over until the last note resounds!
Crank the volume up, pour yourself a drink, sit back and to hell with the neighbours and be prepared to be taken on a sonic journey of a life time.",1376524800,4,2369,4.6270783847981
5178173,5,B008PALI5S,"The Hughes H-4 Hercules was a heavy transport aircraft built by Hughes Aircraft. The aircraft made its first and only flight on November 2, 1947. Built from wood because of wartime restrictions on the use of aluminum, its critics nicknamed it the ""Spruce Goose."" It is the largest flying boat ever built and has the largest wingspan of any aircraft in history. In fact, it was too big to fly. Likewise, the SST Concorde, which flew well but was too big to fly commercially. And then there were the ships: the Vasa, a Swedish warship built in 1626-1628, which sank after sailing less than 2 km on its maiden voyage, and the Great Eastern, an English paddlewheel built in the 1850s, 692 feet long and too big to be docked in any port in the world.

Mahler's Symphony 8 is too big to fly or float. At best it can 'process' grandly, like a holy relic borne between enemy armies to avow the Peace of God. At worst, it wallows and lists in its own wake until its brass cannons break their lashes and the whole gaudy Gargantua sinks. I've heard it live, I've heard it on LPs and CDs and now on this DVD, and frankly I don't think ""heard"" is the right word. It can't be heard; it can only be experienced. Many people find that experience exhilarating. I'm not one of them, though the sight of more than a thousand young choristers responding to the hands and face of conductor Gustavo Dudamel is impressive. This performance is indeed a triumph, not of Mahler's music but of El Sistema, the Venezuelan program that offers free musical training to over 400,000 youths. Dudamel is himself a product of El Sistema.

Don't take my 5-star rating as an endorsement of the music, or the performance, or the audio engineering! It would not be worth ""hearing"" without ""seeing."" The choir outbellows the orchestra whenever it's summoned forth, despite the fact that the instruments number in the hundreds, combining the LA Philharmonic and the Simn Bolvar Symphony. Alas, 'we' should have been there; recording technology couldn't possibly capture the details of such a performance. And you can't evaluate Dudamel's interpretation of the symphony per se on the basis of what you can't really hear.

Let's imagine a performance for recording of Symphony 8 , with severely reduced forces. One instrument per part and a chorus of sixteen. What inner musical splendors would you hear? Or are there such splendors? I for one haven't heard them yet on any of the existing recordings.

But I have grave doubts about whether the Symphony of a Thousand can ever ""fly."" It's heavier than air, and air is what carries sound waves. It's an evolutionary end-product like the brontosaur, the giant ground sloth, or the California condor -- majestic but cumbrous. Or like one of the great engineering failures of human history: the Tower of Babel, the Siena cathedral of 1339, the Anthaeum Conservatory of Sussex in the 1830s, or the Three Gorges Dam in modern China, all of them too big and too ambitious ... unless you consider human ambition to be its own reward.",1368921600,3,3033,4.716981132075472
5178174,5,B008PALI5S,"It's gotta be hard to live up to the hype: ""Symphony of a Thousand"" but this historic recording does, both figuratively, and literally! There are actually over 1,000 performers on stage, including orchestra, soloists, chorus, and conductor.
One night in Caracas, the young phenom conductor Gustavo Dudamel led the combined forces of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Simon Bolvar Symphony Orchestra, along with 8 vocal soloists, and a HUGE double mixed chorus, and a children's chorus, all from a plethora of combined choral forces.
Whew! If you give it a chance, the power of the music and the story will sweep you up into a life-changing experience! No hyperbole.",1367712000,3,668,5.081818181818182

5178176,2,B008PALI5S,"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this disc, but it falls well short of the mark.  I'm an audiophile first, a classical music lover second.

Granted, this is a Herculean undertaking, but this production falls short on so many technical counts, it is difficult to enjoy the performance.

First, it's dark, the stage at the facility in Venezuela is not well lighted.  You spend most of the disc hoping someone will turn up the lights.  Second, Dudamel is out of focus for the entire performance.  Can't decide if this is a ""depth of field"" issue because it's so dark, or that the ""Unmanned"" camera focused on his position is simply out of focus.

Like the cameras, the microphones appear to have been placed and not mixed or managed.  Far too much emphasis on the surround sound levels, causing the listener to put up with the sound of hundreds of squeaky metal chairs in each ear while attempting to follow the performance.

The performers deserved better and I'm a little surprised DG put their name on this one.  Perhaps it is a far better stereo CD than a multi-track video production.

Save your money, pass on this one.  If you want to see Blu Ray done right, treat yourself to Mahler 2 from Accentus, Riccardo Chailly and the Gewandhausorchester Leipiz.  It too is available from Amazon and could be used as a ""Master Class"" in how to do Blu Ray production of large-scale symphony orchestras.  You won't be sorry...

UPDATE:  Just purchased Mahler 8 Blu-Ray with Riccardo Chailly on Accentus Music (Available on Amazon).  It is everything this Dudamel disc is not.  It is spectacular, and now my ""Go-To"" Mahler 8 disc....",1366416000,16,1627,4.709219858156028

5178179,4,B008PALI5S,"I really wanted to give a rating of 4.75 or even 4.95 stars instead of just 4 because this thrilling performance of Mahler's 8th symphony conducted by Gustavo Dudamel Ramirez back at the beginning of 2012 was so close to being perfect! The large or even huge performing forces required by this symphony without an excellent conductor at the helm can cause it to sound muddy and chaotic. There was no muddiness or chaos here. It was well defined, crystal clear and emotionally stirring. The only thing that marred it was the native Spanish speaking choruses had very mushy German diction (trouble pronouncing/enunciating the consonants at the end of German words) during the 2nd part of the symphony. I, indeed, can empathize with this being being a native Portuguese & Spanish speaker myself. This caused many of the words of the 2nd part of the symphony to lack the punch/emphasis they needed. The HD video and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound of this Blu-ray disc recording was excellent (crystal clear and dynamic) - bravo to Deutsche Grammophon!

Two Symphony orchestras and four choirs, a total of 1400 musicians combined with an excellent recording and performance makes this a unique and historic recording.  I highly recommend it.",1358467200,,311,5.03921568627451
5178183,4,B008PALI5S,"It was February of 2012 when -for two weeks- Dudamel and both the SBSO and the LAP walked through the whole Mahler's Symphony repertoire on the Teatro Teresa Carreo. The tickets sold too fast -the TTC is not a large venue, around 2500 people capacity- so I was only able to get tickets just for the 5th Symphony (A memorable evening with one of Mahler's best).

The 8th is a very demanding piece of work divided in two parts. The Part I is a sort of spectacular Oratorio-Cantata; Part II is an extended musically-multifaceted affair containing some of the most beautiful music that Mahler ever wrote. Due to all the forces required -Two mixed Choirs, a Children Choir, 8 soloists and an enlarged orchestra plus an organ- it makes the symphony a difficult one to perform and a nightmare to rehearse properly. In the case of this particular performance the numbers were about 1200 singers and a 200-people orchestra. Under Dudamel's baton it is a solid performance -even more so when you realize it's a live single-shot performance- with some rough parts here and there, but with an undeniable raw sense and lots of visceral power, and showing the musicianship of all involved. Certainly there are better or more refined versions out there (Georg Solti and the CSO, Leonard Bernstein and the WPO, Vaclav Neumann and the CPO, Robert Shaw and the ASO just to name a few) but most of them are ""studio"" recordings made through several different sessions and with smaller, somehow more manageable forces. The great value of this disc is to have captured an entrancing performance of this symphony in all its magnificence and sheer scale that -being prohibitive, seldom is the rule nowadays.

The 1080i video is serviceable and detailed with some stunning vistas of the 1200 choristers performing. The DTS-Master HD audio is a little uneven: it was close-miked in sectors -you can hear cracking chairs or steps all over the place- and the perspective is lost in some others. I know that for the Deutsche Grammophon's technicians had to be some kind of nightmare to deal with the TTC acoustics (The TTC is a venue designed to be fit for many uses -concert, ballet, opera, etc. - but not particularly good at any, and it has no built-in organ) and the too-many musicians, but the end result is a somehow anemic bass-lacking sound.",1357257600,2,2320,4.7975
5178184,5,B008PALI5S,"With a excellant line-up of soloists, a massive chorus of over 1,000 and two combined orchestras, this will knock you out of your seat!  And the chorus, including a huge children's chorus singing from memory, stands for the full 90 minutes. The excitement is visceral, as one wonders if this huge performance might come off its wheels, but Dudamel seems to be channeling Mahler himself, and delivers a performance of a lifetime.  Oh to have been there!
The added feature is very nice, showing how the two orchestras worked together, like two families sharing one daddy, since Dudamel conducts both the LA Philharmonic and the Orchestra of Venezuela.",1356048000,3,649,5.0

5178187,4,B008PALI5S,"While this is not the last word on Mahler 8, it provides some unique thrills.  I will gladly exchange the softest pianissimos for the fullness, warmth and richness of the choral sound.  Although most of the choristers are young, they achieve a very fine blend.  I would cavil, though, at their German pronunciation, which seems mushy and pasted-on (compare Solti's German-speaking choruses).  A counter-example to hand is the solo tenor, who copes as well as anyone with his fiendishly high part, putting the words across with flair and accuracy.  The soloists overall are just under the top rank, with the ""Gretchen"" a standout, her tone silver coated with velvet.

While I am not a member of the Dudamel ""cult"", I do find that most of his interpretations sound newly-minted.  He gets from his conjoined orchestras the same committed and beautiful playing as on his recent ""Eroica"".  Dudamel often captures the true Mahler sound.  Part One ends with an enormous rush of elation, and he brings Part Two to a satisfying conclusion.  There are places which could have relaxed more, but on the whole the Solti-like fast tempos help hold the work together. Although the organ is barely audible, the sound is otherwise quite good, and the camera work is fine.  There is an inoffensive ""behind the scenes"" documentary included.  This DVD should give much pleasure.",1351468800,11,1358,4.986666666666666
5178188,5,B008PALI5S,"Gustavo Dudamel's Mahler First on DVD was, as Clive Goodwin points out, quite disappointing: focused on superficial effect rather than substance, especially in comparison with the stunning Dvorak ""New World"" he recorded with the Radio Symphony Orchestra Stuttgart (Birthday Concert for Pope Benedict XVI). One could then suspect that the young conductor had not quite plumbed the depth and idiom of Mahler's musical language. So it was with slight trepidation when I ordered the disk, but everything fell into place happily when I played it the first time around. If you want to know my own personal ambivalent feelings about the Eighth - Mahler's last, gargantuan and somewhat desperate fling with late Romanticism - do read my reviews of the Bernstein (with the Seventh) and Tennstedt (with the First) readings on DVD, both noble and persuasive performances, though now dated in audio and video. The outstanding recent recording by Chailly and the Gewandhausorchester brought the oratorio-symphony much closer to me: it is wonderfully exuberant, highly disciplined at the same time and always conscious of the various structural layers, the shifts in mood and the balances between human and instrumental voices, not to mention the virtuosity of all involved.

Dudamel has assembled more than 1000 participants: Mahler's dream is finally realized in our time. The rehearsals must have been grueling. As it turns out, the recording of these two orchestras combined into one big happy band, the very fine (perhaps not altogether outstanding) soloists and the army of choristers - no small feat indeed - is surprisingly clear, though certainly not lean. Video is very good. Dudamel has a firm and thoughtful grip on the proceedings, he obviously knows the music very well, his body language is appropriate and he appears to be in touch with every group, even each individual musician. This is quite amazing. His approach to the score may not be as detail-focused as Chailly's and Tennstedt's - let's say it is slightly more synthetic than analytical - but not a single note is lost or glossed over.

From the initial organ chord and jubilant orchestral-choral bars, the mood of the Veni Creator Spiritus is joyous, festive and simply overwhelming. You can almost see Mahler smiling down from Heaven. The Second Part, based on Goethe's Faust II, much less compact and somewhat problematic to carry off without dragging, is played and sung very well indeed. Every nuance of pain, love and ecstasy is shaped beautifully and the ending - Faust's deliverance after his 100-year quest through time, life, guilt and redemption - is apocalyptic. Next to the soloists, who give their all, the various choirs shine out, in particular the children, without sheet music, obviously rehearsed splendidly and fully transported by the spirit of the occasion. Brava Venezuela for these beautiful musical youths! All in all, this adds up to a stunning and deeply moving performance you don't want to miss. It goes, together with Chailly, to the top of my Mahler shelf - after I listen to it at least once more.",1349740800,14,3090,5.116831683168317
5178189,5,B008PALI5S,"If there's one thing Mahler wanted, it was to have as many performers as possible in his symphonies, none more so than the eighth, called ""Symphony of A Thousand"". However, rarely, if ever, did the complement of participants live up to the title claim.

In this case, as well as a combined orchestral effort from the L.A. Phil. and the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela, where they were able to double down on the strings and augment certain other sections, there is a choir combination totaling well over 1200 singers. 400 0f them are young children, who perform throughout without a score.  As besotted as Mahler was with his two little daughters, he would have been really touched, as I was, by the sight of all these youngsters singing their hearts out - and very well, too!

Performances of this scale are usually cost-prohibitive, but I suspect these kids, having been given the benefit of free musical education by the Venezuelan state, probably did this just for the glory of it. And what a glorious sound they make.

When I listen to this piece, surround sound volume cranked up, I expect to be overwhelmed at the Part One climax, and tearfully stunned at the end of Part Two! Mission accomplished in spades here on both counts.

In bluray, the vista of all those people performing as one is breathtaking - you can see each one clearly.

As hard as it is to get eight perfect soloists for this work, this is a better than average group here. I liked them all. In the Mater Gloriosa ""balcony scene"", we actually get to see Kiera Duffy's walk down the ""aisle"" several minutes before her two-line solo (which takes less time than the walk!). All in shimmering yellow and red lighting.

No one would rate the L.A. or the Bolivar orchestras as top-echelon bands, but they acquit themselves very well, and they certainly have sheer numbers and volume on their side. Perfect ensemble has to be difficult with that many strings. I thought the orchestral balance very good.

I wasn't fond of Dudamel's Mahler 1 with the L.A. Phil.,(a bit too precious)but here I was impressed by his control and minimal histrionics. Very rarely did he refer to his score - for me that means he did lots of prep.

The video is excellent, and the camera work likewise. The shots of the youngest children are priceless, some of them unable to resist the camera nearby!

The DTS MASTER AUDIO sound really envelopes you - in fact, I heard a few too many creaks and other extraneous background noises, which is probably the result of some close miking. No matter - if I'd been fortunate enough to be there, I'd have heard worse.

It's doubtful any other group will attempt to approach this Mahler 8 in size any time soon, if ever. A year ago, Chailly gave us an excellent version with the Leipzig forces, using more traditional size choirs. Bernstein's almost 40 year old version cannot compete in picture or sound, even though his efforts are always worth watching.

We have been promised an Abbado/Lucerne 8th. to complete his Mahler cycle, but every year Claudio the Procrastinator finds a fresh excuse not to fulfil this promise (the latest purported reasons - pick one - are:- can't find the right singers, doesn't really like the piece, too much rehearsal needed, ill-health, Blah-blah-blah!) Meanwhile he has now got lapped by two excellent performances, after which, one has to ask, why bother, Claudio? This may be blasphemy to the Abbado acolytes, but I sure don't need another Mahler 8 on top of the Chailly and the Dudamel, as good as they are.

This is an irresistible document of a once in a lifetime occasion. Buy it and love it!",1349654400,6,3630,4.6976377952755906
5178190,5,B008PALI5S,"In spite of the fact that over a thousand performers are employed here, this is actually a remarkably 'musical' account of Mahler's colossal 8th symphony. The sound quality captured here is equally remarkable for such a challenging, one-off performance. The enlarged choral forces and augmented string section (strings were combined from both orchestras) shift balances away from the brass, woodwinds and vocal soloists, and transfer greater emphasis - logically enough - on to the choral passages. There is, in fact, historical precedence for doing this and I'll elaborate on that point further down.

A previous reviewer suggested that Dudamel should have striven for a more detailed and clearer performance. But we already have two DVD's of Mahler 8 that do just that: Bernstein/V.P.O./DG (combined with an equally fine Mahler 7) and, more sharply focused yet, Chailly/Gewandhaus Orch./Accentus from the 2011 Leipzig Mahlerfest. That's not to mention a whole slough of very fine and very detailed CD recordings of the work. Just going by Deutsche Grammophon alone, the Boulez M8 is exceedingly clear and detailed (as one would expect). So then, if we lose some detail and clarity with the greater numbers, what do we gain in return?

For starters, the children's chorus is much, much stronger than what we usually hear. For example, ""Jene Rosen, aus den Haenden"" (track 16), as well as ""Er uberwaechst uns schon"" (track 23) - a passage that is nearly always embarrassingly 'too wimpy' sounding. These two passages are truly improved by the greater numbers. The very start of ""Alles vergaengliche"" (the final track) is a bit louder than what we're generally used to hearing, but that first entrance is also far better supported from the low voices - baritones and bass/baritones in particular. The softer choral parts of the ""Blicket auf"" passage (track 25) are firmer and easier to hear as well. Best of all, when we get to ""hinan"" - the last word sung in the entire symphony - that last syllable floats right over the offstage brass, instead of the other way around. Think of all the recordings you've heard where ""hinan"" just disappears beneath the offstage trumpets and trombones (as well as the fortissimo smash on the tam-tam). These may seem like small and petty points, but I believe they add to a more involving Mahler 8 experience. They do for me, anyway. Also, do we really need to hear every bloody detail from the brass during the big double fugue in Part I? Here, in Caracas, the dovetailing entrances of the various sections of Choir I and Choir II are firmer and easier to delineate. Shouldn't we be listening to the choral forces during the fugue instead of the brass? Now we'll jump back to Munich in September of 1910, the premiere of Mahler's 8th symphony.

The organizing of the performers, and the subsequent logistics in getting them to and housed in Munich, fell upon a professional impresario: Emil Gutmann. In his many correspondences with Gutmann, Mahler began to worry that his 8th was turning into a runaway train - a ""Barnum & Bailey act"". He was rightfully worried that such large numbers would mean that numerous people wouldn't have been rehearsed enough. In all, Gutmann rounded up slightly over 1,000 performers, but it's now believed the actual number was slightly less than a thousand (thus, Dudamel may actually hold the record). Regardless, the premiere in Munich turned out to be the high-water mark of Mahler's entire career. Applause went on for nearly a half-hour and the children stormed around Mahler himself, wanting to hug and 'high-five' the great master. Given a time machine, this would absolutely be the first place I would go to. For on that day in Munich, even Mahler didn't worry about the clarity of each and every, bloop and bleep from the woodwinds and brass. The overwhelming, cumulative effect carried the day. And so it does in Caracas as well.

Of course, all of this wouldn't mean much if you had a poor line-up of vocal soloists. But on that point, let's all agree that pretty much every cast for the Mahler 8th is something of a mixed bag. The good news with Dudamel's cast is that the two most important roles are sung by vocalists who are quite good: tenor Burkhard Fritz and soprano Julianna Di Giacomo. Fritz does a fine job on his two difficult solos in Part II: ""Hochste Herrscherin der Welt"" (track 19) and ""Blicket auf, alle reuig zarten"" (track 25). While maybe not the most beautiful sounding soprano ever to have come along, Di Giacomo does a superb job of belting out her big solo towards the end of Part II (track 23), with Goethe's promise of a newer, brighter day (located just before Kierra Duffy sings her brief offstage solo in her shimmery, slinky gown - the 'eternal feminine' incarnate).

For all the hype around Dudamel, he conducts the 8th with a strong combination of focus and restraint. In fact, he displays far more restraint with his gestures than either Chailly or Bernstein (particularly Bernstein, of course). Yet, he's always clear. He's also never looking down at his score - a big plus in my book. My only complaint is a very minor one. For my taste, Dudamel could have gone slightly slower at the very end, where the offstage trumpets make their dramatic leap of a ninth (two times). Also, the final chord could have been held just a couple of seconds longer. But these are minor grumblings for sure. By and large, he does a remarkable job for tackling the 8th so early in his career. For me, this is a huge improvement over his Mahler 1 with the Los Angeles Phil., also captured on a DG dvd.

In the end, I wouldn't want to part with any of my three DVD's of Mahler 8: Bernstein, Chailly or Dudamel. Perhaps the best compromise of the three is the Chailly, but his tenor isn't quite as good as Bernstein's Kenneth Riegel, or Dudamel's Burckhard Fritz. Bernstein's is an electric performance, but both Chailly and Dudamel have the advantage in sound and picture quality. But given the improved support for the choral forces employed, if you were to put a gun to my head, I would choose to hang on to the new Dudamel. It's THAT moving for me.",1348876800,51,6142,4.789622641509434
