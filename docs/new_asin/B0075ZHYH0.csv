8510683,3,B0075ZHYH0,"When I initially saw this title with its director & who was in this, I got real excited. I mean Sun Chung, to me at least, is one of the most underrated directors at Shaw Brothers. His catalog includes hits such as Avenging Eagle, Kung Fu Instructor, Deadly Breaking Sword, To Kill a Mastermind & non-SB film A Fist Full of Talons. Also he works with Fu Sheng, Ku Feng & perennial baddie Wang Lung Wei on a number of those films so I thought I was in for a treat. Well what began as a fun romp ended being a preachy sanctimonious effort that I couldn't wrap my arms around.

The movie centers around a statue which the European foreigners in this film were eyeing to have for their very own, but it had intrinsic spiritual value to the villagers of the town led by a well known medicine man (Ku Feng). This medicine man has a son (Fu Sheng) who he's been trying to teach so that he can one day take over the family business. And of course both father & son is adept at martial arts. The foreigners are supported by the town's chairman (Tang Ching) & his pugilistic son (Wang Lung Wei). The chairmen also brings in a small group of Japanese swordsmen, who are led by Chan Wei Man, to lend a hand to their side. There's a decent amount of fighting & a ton of comedy here, both of which Fu Sheng is comfortable in but to me it seems like it's an overused concept. And also, it ran a familiar tenor of the Chinese vs. foreign entities which has been done to death. Don't get me wrong; there's instances where it works perfectly (Fist of Fury, Heroes of the East, Hapkido just to name a few). But here it falls flat.

Fu Sheng is who he is at this stage in his filmography. His career has 2 halves: pre-leg injury he was a kung fu master who happens to be funny & charming whereas post-leg injury he's a funny man who knows kung fu. This film was done post. Ku Feng rarely disappoints in whatever role he's given. You need him to be an honorable leader, no problem. Need him to give you a turn as a villain, handles it with ease. He never cheats you with his performances. Wang Lung Wei, on the other hand, gives you one thing & that he does very well: villiainry! Chan Wei Man is one of those dudes where you wonder how in the world will the protagonist beat this guy...he's that good! Also in this is Yuen Wah as one of Chan Wei Man's Japanese guys & Cecilia Wong as a possible love interest of Fu Sheng.

The fighting is good here. It's just that there's not enough of it for my liking. Again the storyline is way overused. Then there's the comedy. Too much of it! For a minute I had to double check the credits to see the director...seemed more like a Liu Chia Liang film. Overall, it's definitely worth a watch. When you sit down watch this & you've seen your share of Fu Sheng movies this doesn't stand too far above his other efforts, especially after the leg injury he suffered. As for Sun Chung fans, this falls slightly below other films he's helmed.",1498435200,,2955,4.23581560283688

8510686,4,B0075ZHYH0,Great old school kungfu flick. Wish thew movies were voice over dubbed like when I was a kid and would go to Times Square and view.,1484697600,,131,4.076923076923077
8510687,5,B0075ZHYH0,"I liked this film a lot.  It had humor, nicely choreographed kung-fu, good acting and a decent story.  Dubbed in cantonese with English subtitle, it's about a young man who just loves kung-fu.  Girls like him, but he's only into the girl across the street from his dad's herbal shop.  The story takes place during a time when Westerners and Japanese invades China with their arrogance of them being better than the Chinese in every way, from medicine to martial arts.  These outsiders often are linked to small groups of elitist Chinese who will do anything to please foreigners for reasons of wealth.  This includes challenging/mistreating the Chinese culture/people and smuggling Chinese goods even if it means theft such as a Buddhist sculpture. If you don't watch this movie carefully, you might miss some major points that the Chinese were resenting of foreigners such as the reference the father makes about the terrible things opium did to the Chinese people (brought to China by Western nations) when talking to a patient's mother.  Great Movie about a father and son who create a bond when resisting foreign influence.",1483401600,,1127,4.994652406417113
8510688,5,B0075ZHYH0,"Alexander Fu Sheng display a lot of martial arts skill in this movie.
Feels like a fun Chinese New Year movie ~",1482796800,,111,4.090909090909091
8510689,4,B0075ZHYH0,"This was an enjoyable movie if you're a fan of the genre and of Alexander Fu Sheng in particular. Although the movie was clear and easily viewable, my one problem with it seems inherent to the VCD format. You have to change the disk in the middle of the movie. This may be a slight, unimportant minor annoyance for some or a real pain in the butt for others. Be sure you are interested in any movie in VCD format if this pause in the middle bothers you. (Some movies, like this one, don't seem to be available in DVD format.)",1400976000,,525,4.207920792079208
8510690,5,B0075ZHYH0,"This movie was wonderful. The interaction between Ku Fend and Fu Sheng as father and son was just magical. Fu Sheng was truly a master of the martial arts being a student of the great Master Lau Kar-leung. He takes on Japanese Samauri, Wester Boxers, Wrestlers and weilds just about every weapon imaginable. If you're a fan of any martial artistry, do yourself a favor and buy it!",1362528000,,380,4.602941176470588
