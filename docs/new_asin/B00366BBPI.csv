8389549,3,B00366BBPI,"Too often, environmental documentaries show so much doom and gloom that they can make you despair, rather than take action.  I liked that the MM installment ""Environmental Tech"" showed that solutions are being invented.  This installment also shows signs of hope.
Now let me admit that science bores and confuses me as a subject.  I was thrilled when I took my last physics final and realized that I would never have to take another science class.  Worse, I'm one of many people who only pays attention to biology if I'm going to pay attention to any science at all.  Thus, I must admit that this MM installment focused a lot on chemistry.  It was hard for me to follow, but I give them credit for trying to make the discussion dunce-friendly.  I'm writing this review years after this episode aired and modern times only makes it more current.  Recently, a bridge in Washington state collapsed and President Obama stated that this wouldn't happen as much if the country addressed its infrastructure failures more.
Only the last ten minutes are about decomposition.  The show presents termites as being green saviors.  One scientist said there are approximately 2,000 species of termites and only a dozen of them are seen as destructive.  That's great: but let's a find a way to use them and also keep them away from bug haters.  If you like this installment of MM, I think you will also enjoy NatGeo's ""Life After People.""  That documentary basically said that everything humans have created will one day decompose, from quotidian houses to the Eiffel Tower.
The most horrifying segment comes near the end.  It speaks of all the plastics floating in the Pacific Ocean.  In fact, it said ten percent of all plastics will end up there.  They force humans to care by stating that fish that are messed up by these plastics get eaten by humans and may increase incidents of cancer and other health problems.  I wish there were a way to make a business of collecting that junk.  The work said trash in landfills is being used to produce methane that can be used as energy.
I hope more optimistic products can be made on how to not screw up the environment.  I think if philanthropists can invest in this research and humans can practice things in a daily manner, we could correct some of the damage we've shamelessly caused.",1369526400,,2319,4.709677419354839
