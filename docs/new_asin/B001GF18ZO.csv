8305184,5,B001GF18ZO,Very helpful DVD! Delivered in a timely manner also!,1490054400,,52,4.888888888888889
8305185,4,B001GF18ZO,I bought this from the Good Bird website.  It was informative.,1409788800,,62,4.636363636363637
8305186,3,B001GF18ZO,"This film did not really explain what to do when your bird is feeling angry, frustrated, etc.  The quiz section had about 3 different moods of the bird, and I was expecting one mood.  Barbara knows her stuff and her subject, but ten more minutes should have been spent on how to work with animals even though they might feel insecure, afraid, etc.  I've had my Amazon for 8 years (almost his whole life), and my mom's African grey has only been with us three months.  What do we do when the bird is nervous?  You can't always leave them alone and let them relax.  She did explain a couple new feelings and expressions our birds have, which was helpful.  This was helpful if you are new to birds, especially large parrots.  Her emphasis on patience with animals is also very helpful.",1392076800,,782,4.457746478873239
8305187,5,B001GF18ZO,Video is informative and nicely done!  Remembering that parrots are not a domesticated animal it is great to see a video describing and showing various body language displays to help owners understand their companion and prevent bites or negative behaviors.  Excellent video!,1330560000,3,275,5.523809523809524
8305188,3,B001GF18ZO,"I was disappointed with the packaging, the DVD case was broken when it reached me in Australia. Heidenreich clearly knows her subject, however I would have liked to have seen better editing and heard better audio on the DVD. It was sometimes difficult to follow. Perhaps a couple of repeat examples would be beneficial.",1316390400,4,319,4.925925925925926
8305189,5,B001GF18ZO,"Understanding that all responsible animal owners could feel vulnerable when it comes to finding help, especially through a DVD, rest assured when you buy anything by Barbara Heidenreich. There is no fancy editing (suggesting a false TAH DAH!!!! moment) or promises of things you can't do on your own.

To be honest: I am a mammal person. I am much more verse in watching tails or ears to understand the animal's ""language"". I know that working with animals it is ALL about timing, not ever taking out anger on my animals, and I know having a parrot can be challenging.

However now that I have watched Barbara's DVD on Parrot Body Language (and even before watching it for a second time) I am so much more aware of subtle moves that our new Yellow-Naped Amazon Parrot has been offering.

Not only is he not biting because I am not threatening him but also our bird is MUCH happier with my not harassing him (through mis-understanding his ""hints"").

As soon as Ms. Heidenreich makes the next DVD I will be at the front of the cue to buy and watch it......making both our parrot's and our lives much richer and better together.

Thanks to Barbara Heidenreich and her continued work dedicated to birds!!!",1230422400,15,1201,4.64622641509434
