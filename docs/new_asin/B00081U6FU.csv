8055317,2,B00081U6FU,"I got 30 minutes into the film and fast forwarded to the end. It's a tad dated and amateurish. The premise is cute, though less so when considered through contemporary eyes.  Some unexpectedly bad language, for a movie of that time that needed more 'fluff' treatment.",1522540800,,267,4.804347826086956
8055318,3,B00081U6FU,"Saw this on Comedy Central years ago. If you really want to watch the movie, stick to straming because twice zi ordered the DVD and both times it arrived damaged, making it unwatchable. The case the manufacturer uses may be the problem because both times the disc had become loose and became scratched by the case. Return promptly to Amazon if you have this issue!",1515369600,,364,4.615384615384615

8055321,4,B00081U6FU,"Not the best film in the world, but fun.  Zach Galligan a nice screen presence  (why haven't we seen
him more often?)  The bartender with the Louise Brooks wig  was amusing.",1399334400,2,173,4.483870967741935
