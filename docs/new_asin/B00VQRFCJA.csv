8710984,3,B00VQRFCJA,"""The Scorpio Letters"" (1967) is an unconvincing adaptation of a novel by Victor Canning (original author of ""The Rainbird Pattern,"" the novel Hitchcock based ""Family Plot"" and many others).  Granted it was a TV-movie that MGM made on its backlots, quite a few of those renowned TV movies like ""The Girl Most Likely To"" and ""The Sex Symbol"" have become cult items.  Alex Cord does not seem like he's sleeping his way through.  In fact, it is very important in his catalog as he plays a relatively conventional, although there is the element, as was prevalent in most of his overvre, of the failed making a comeback: the drug addict in ""Synanon;"" the Ringo Kid in ""Stagecoach (1966);"" the alcoholic archeologist in Armando Crispino's ""The Dead Are Alive;"" and the possibly epileptic gunslinger in ""A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die.""  This is a rare opportunity to enjoy a side of him that his ""bad boy"" image works against him, to be the protagonist of knock-off spy thriller that Hitchcock did best with Robert Donat in ""The 39 Steps"" or Joel McCrea in ""Foreign Correspondent.""  Shirley Eaton co-stars and is rather wooden.  Directed by Richard Thorpe, who had prior directed ""That Funny Feeling"" with Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin and ""The Truth About Spring with John and Hayley Mills and several Elvis vehicles including ""Jailhouse Rock,"" with the apparent limited budget, presents a passable sense of the locales (MGM was masterful at creating sets that seemed authentic (""Made in Paris"" (1966)) and directs a competent cast of seasoned unknown actors in a deft, but tepid screenplay Adrian Spies and Jo Eisinger, seemingly done by the numbers.  It also has a very good, distinguished soundtrack by AA winner, Dave Grusin, I believe his first.  The Warner Archive product is presented in widescreen in Metrocolor.  Includes a trailer.",1464307200,,1835,4.95114006514658

8710986,2,B00VQRFCJA,"The cover on this DVD promises a lot of thrills. However, this was a movie made for television in 1967, and the limited budget shows throughout. Except for a sequence at the very end, the whole thing was shot on a tiny backlot.  For those of you seeking a good old retro time in the then popular spy thriller genre, this will prove to be an excruciating time-waster. You may be fast forwarding a lot as you watch a competent cast, a terrible script and an over-the-hill director try to fool you into thinking you're watching a complicated plot taking place throughout European locales. Even the charms of sex kitten Shirley Eaton are wasted here. Leading man Alex Cord looks as though hes going to fall asleep anytime soon as cliche piles onto cliche.

The story is not so much about international intrigue, as it is about a blackmailing ring that has been responsible for the death of a British spy. Why they hire an American ex-cop to do the investigation is never rationally explained. The whole dumb undertaking is sprinkled with generous doses of coincidences and technical gaffes (a British red phone booth in Paris, the same tea cup sipped in London and later in Paris, and, inexplicably, a final rendezvous in a ski resort with a functioning lift but no snow and no skiers in sight, the dusty surroundings looking suspiciously like summer in Southern California).

The DVD is presented in wide screen (1:85) color, and the print is excellent, and thats about the only good thing here. However, if you must, this is strictly a rental and only for die-hard Cord or Eaton fans.",1431388800,4,1582,4.703971119133574
