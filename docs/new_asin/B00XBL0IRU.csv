Summer has come and is almost gone and now it's time for Back to School Fun! Caillou Goes Back to School is now available to purchase on DVD! I remember all to well the days our Liz was one of the biggest Caillou fans out there. Those days are long gone sadly, but I am super glad that my nephew Mason will have the opportunity to get to go on the great adventures with Caillou.  Caillou has been a household name for 25 years and PBS is celebrating this anniversary by having a bundle feature. The DVD Caillou Goes Back to School, includes 12 stories which runs for around 100 minutes and provides lots of growing up adventures. But my favorite part of this bundle feature is the illustrated bonus book about riding the school bus. So kids are taught the love of learning from a young age.

CAILLOU GOES BACK TO SCHOOL DVD + BOOK will be available on July 28. The DVD run time is approximately 100 minutes. The SRP for this bundle is $12.99. The DVD contains special features including a game and printable coloring pages.

The stories included on the DVD are listed below.
