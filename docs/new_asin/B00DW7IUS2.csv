5861123,5,B00DW7IUS2,"Grand kids love this movie ,we raise  Bostons so were taken by the cover  . I wonder how many hundred  viewings before  it dies of  overuse  LOL",1402185600,,144,4.148148148148148
5861124,5,B00DW7IUS2,This was bought for my niece and nephew (one 7 & one 8 years of age) and they loved it.,1401494400,,87,3.4
5861125,4,B00DW7IUS2,"Imagine 'Home Alone' with a dog instead of Kevin, make it a lot hokier, and you have this movie. The bumbling burglars are truly idiotic and the 'pranks' are varied and imaginative. A lot of fart jokes/references in this one, which works for the younger crowd. Moves at a good clip to keep everyone entertained, with nothing I found too offensive for my 6 and 8 year olds to see or hear. Mildly entertaining for adults, but hilarious and a real winner with the kids. Mine were asking to watch it again sometime before it had even ended! The cover is a bit misleading, with the Boston terrier. While he is in the movie plenty, it really focuses on a different dog of another breed- a cattle dog, I think.",1398988800,7,703,4.415384615384616
5861126,5,B00DW7IUS2,"I gave this as a gift to a 3 year-old who happens to have a Boston Terrier.  He loved it, and his mother said it was a great film.  Looking forward to buying this for our future grandchild.",1391299200,3,189,3.9473684210526314
5861127,4,B00DW7IUS2,"With the Hallmark over doing there Christmas season this year, I was becoming a little burned out by the time I ordered this. It was a good movie, but maybe I was tired of Christmas movies by the time I saw this movie. I would say as Christmas movies go, this was a good one.",1390867200,,275,4.0181818181818185

5861129,5,B00DW7IUS2,This is a cute movie.  It involves three dogs.  They all talk so you can understand what is going on.,1390608000,2,101,4.0
5861130,4,B00DW7IUS2,"We picked this movie for our granddaughter as we have Boston Terriers! She loved it, although the cover misleads you to think the Boston is the major character in the movie. It was funny and a good holiday movie for kids!",1386892800,5,221,4.414634146341464
5861131,3,B00DW7IUS2,this movie is a good one for younger kids and does not really compare to that of the first Home Alone movie,1383609600,,107,3.909090909090909
5861132,4,B00DW7IUS2,My grandchildren enjoyed this movie.,1427068800,,36,6.4
5861133,5,B00DW7IUS2,"Better than ""that other movie"" that shares a similar title.  The dogs are much cuter than the bratty little blonde headed spoiled brat.
Great Christmas entertainment.",1421798400,,166,5.384615384615385

5861138,3,B00DW7IUS2,"It is misleading, the boston terrier isn't really in much of the movie. I bought it because my daughter has a boston terrier. Also when I played the movie, it was messing up terrible. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this or not with there's. All my other movies work fine.",1419897600,,284,4.377358490566038

8598619,4,B00DW7IUS2,This is a great movie along the lines of Home Alone only involving dogs. My grandsons love it and I got it as a Christmas present for them. I gave it 4 stars as I was a Prime member and told that I would have it in 2 days through the email confirmation. Then I received the second confirmation and informed that I would have it in 5 days. It did arrive on the 5th day.,1529625600,,368,3.8552631578947367
8598620,5,B00DW7IUS2,"I bought this just because I have two Boston Terriers. I am so busy, I have not had a chance to watch but every time I look at the picture, I smile. Too cute! Will watch one day :-)",1493510400,,181,3.6666666666666665
