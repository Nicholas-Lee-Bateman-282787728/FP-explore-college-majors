8154412,5,B000K4WOKK,"I bought this ballet a year ago (march 2008) in a three set package of Tchaikovsky Ballets. When I first viewed it I said, ""I don't like this version of 'The Nutcracker'"". I viewed it again a year later and discovered that something was wrong with my brain, it had not seen things correctly. I was completely wrong about what I said to myself. This is a wonderful heart warming story of an aging ballerina and emigre from Russia, living alone under poor circumstances in Australia. Her friends visit her at Christmas time, and they reminisce about the old days when they were all dancers. Colin Peasley, (Dr. Coppelius in the Australian Ballet version of ""Coppelia""), plays the part of one of her old friends, and teacher of her dance classes.....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Australian-Ballet-Coppelia/dp/B0006A9HV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Australian Ballet - Coppelia</a>.....You simply MUST have their ""Coppelia"". Justine Summers (see below) is in that too, but the star is Lisa Pavane as Swanilda.

The elder Clara (she was 72 when she starred in this production in 1994), overexerts herself and her doctor puts her to bed, and then the ""dream"" begins. Everything from the classical Nutcracker is there, the Christmas tree (does not grow), the Nutcracker, the Mice, the Snowflakes, All the music (a bit out of order), and all the dances. The dream takes her back to her native Russia and her training (it's wonderful how they age her), her graduation, falling in love, and the beginning of her dancing career, her travels, and finally her settling in Australia. There is truth in many of her memories, for ballet did begin in Australia when Russians on tour were stranded in Australia in the early forties at the beginning of WWII.

The elder Clara is played by Margaret Scott (who still looked good in a tutu), the ballerina Clara is played by Vicky Attard, the child Clara is played by Siobhan Elsmann, and her love object (her Doctor) is played by Steven Heathcote. Also in the cast is Justine Summers, who stars with Steven Heathcote in ""Manon"" by the Australian Ballet (Excellent)...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Massenet-Manon-Sir-Kenneth-MacMillan-Royal-Australian-Ballet-Justine-Summers/dp/B000G1ALFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Massenet - Manon / Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Royal Australian Ballet, Justine Summers</a>....Justine is seen in several of the Nutcracker divertissements, and she is so utterly beautiful it is hard to miss her.

Be advised that this version of Nutcracker is not suitable for children, as the mice are way too scary with huge tentacle-like tails,and dressed in Russian Army Uniforms. Music for this ballet is very good Dolby 2 and surround, filmed in the 3:4 video format, very nice sets and lighting, lots of color, especially in the second act and her training days and travel scenes. The dance of the Snowflakes is superb with a weaving formation slightly detracted from by a close-up, but still beautiful. There is some vintage footage used in this ballet to good effect. Over-all, I think you will enjoy this version of ""The Nutcracker"". ..Something different but not ruined. It's still classical ballet.........Richard.",1306972800,8,3253,5.515030060120241
