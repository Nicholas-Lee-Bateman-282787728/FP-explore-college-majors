8092218,3,B000BT96Q4,"Pretty good for a B movie, if you like Graham Greene. Passable mystery, develops well but a bit stale in spots.",1252713600,,111,4.333333333333333
8092219,2,B000BT96Q4,"Graham Greene is one of my favorite actors, but even he couldn't save this. It was a tv special sort-of movie, and was utterly predictable. Mr Greene's acting is, as always, an insperation, as is the mechanism for solving the mystery.  Unfortunately, neither of these make the movie ultimately work.",1237852800,,299,4.98
