8393403,4,B003B3O5IG,"I bought this film for my daughter who was studying this era at school.  I watched it first and really enjoyed the film.  It is long and sub-titled, but still well worth it.  It had real vision interspersed within it, so you get a real sense of what is was like through this time.  My daughter watched it also and she enjoyed it, though for her elements of it were a bit unreal, but after she had watched it we talked about what I remember about this time and how bad it must have been for them.  We talked about how people in control manipulated different groups over years and all in all a grewat conversation was had.",1347235200,3,620,4.220338983050848
8393404,5,B003B3O5IG,"This intense movie follows a young woman documentary maker on the trail of a fallen hero whose statue is hidden in the basement of a museum. It is the story of Communist Poland in the early 1950s and 1970s as much as of the man, a model brick layer who loses his head to his fame, then his privileged position in society. In the fall of the man, one sees signs of the fall of the Soviet-sponsored state. How prescient, too, as this film came out well before Solidarity sprang up in the shipyards of Gdansk, before anyone in the West could comprehend that the USSR was on the verge of collapse in the time following the debut of this film. Brilliant! Practice your Polish with this one or follow the subtitles, but consider adding this film to your collection of keepers you watch time and again!",1335139200,2,795,4.414965986394558
