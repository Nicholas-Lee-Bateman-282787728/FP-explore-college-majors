8091398,5,B000BRBADS,"Giuseppe Andrews completely blew my mind. I put this in the DVD player and the moment it started I couldn't look away. It was an art piece. A master piece if you will. It's about this 19 year old guy who calls himself Coney Island and spends his time singing songs to the senior citizens at his trailer park resident. I've watched it over and over in the day I had it. I cooked pop corn and grabbed a coke and sat and watched. I laughed at this, and I look at this like it's pure inspiration to any young filmmakers out there. It's like a Harmony Korine film, ""Gummo; Julien Donkey-Boy;""etc. So give it a shot, because I wasn't expecting much, and I got much more than that.",1432425600,2,674,4.232558139534884

8091400,5,B000BRBADS,"Guiseppe Andrews is a new director, and you can have a chance of a lifetime to keep up with the rising of a star in the making, if you start buying his DVD's NOW. Troma is a filmstudio that is the biggest (and only surviving) independent studio, not withstanding all the powers agains them still treating true artlovers the very best in Independent Cinama for over 33 years now. Put the two together and you get a brilliant and ever growing DVD-library of unique films made by someone who will be talked and written about long after we all have gone, as someone who is as unique as Andy Warhol, Orson Welles and Lloyd Kaufman and one of the few big ones to have changed cinema as we know it. Guiseppe Andrews will be imitated, loved, collected and analized.

Many people mistakenly think of Troma as the studio that makes violent and sexy films. Of course they do make wonderful gems in that direction, but there is so much more that most people don't know about. The films by Guiseppe Andrews are amongst these, although I doubt if that be be the case for very long, because worldwide the talents of this highly original and unconventional director are being recognised as we speak. And without Troma the world would not have known of this wonderful talent.

TOUCH ME IN THE MORNING is one of the first films in Andrews' large oeuvre. Shot is a beautifully depressing monochromatic palette it tells the story of the Coming-of-Age story of a young guy who calls himself Coney Island, and who is dealing with a lot of the issues facing today's youth: divorce, unemployment, sexual inadequacy and a gigolo father who has just been released from prison! He goes through this with his own individual optimistisism, which irritates his girlfriend who wants him to grow up. Daddy Bill, however, gives him advice in the ways of life, and Coney goes about on a grotesque and wildly hilarious journey of self-discovery.

Not as complicated and much more assessible than some of Guiseppe Andrews' later masterpieces this is a great way to be introduced to the work of a legend to be.

Three short films by Andrews and an interview with the maverick director conducted by Troma president Lloyd Kaufman round up this amazingly well presented DVD. A must have.",1151366400,3,2247,4.695431472081219
8091401,5,B000BRBADS,"Close. But in truth, Mr. Andrews is, unlike his character in this movie, not a teen. He is, however, a genius.

His genius comes from the fact that he is able to create repulsive characters, and then make the viewer care about these characters. He wrote, directed, shot, and produced this film, in addition to playing the lead role, a character calling himself Coney Island.

The tale is one of Coney's coming of age, told with more skill and humour than any other such movie I have ever seen. You almost don't want to laugh at these situations or characters, but you can't help yourself. Coney is our POV character in this, and the film is told with a bit of in character narration on his part. Normally I do not like in character narration, but Andrews is able to carry it off, making this film look like a peek into the mind of it's lead character.

Despite all of the bad things happening to Coney, though, this is not a sad film at all. He maintains a cheerful, well reasoned optimism that is passed on to the audience.

For now, I am looking forward to seeing his next film, ""Who Flung Poo"", also from Troma.

The disc also contains several extra features, including interviews with Giuseppe and actor Bill Nowlin, who has been in everything that Giuseppe has directed as of this writing. But what is better is that it includes a trio of short subjects that the director made, ""Ants"", The Laundry Room"", and ""Wiggly"". These are in the style of the main feature.

The film is shown in black and white. It does seem that B&W is making a comback, in light of such other well done movies as ""The Last Way Out"" and ""Sin City"". The photography in each of these films serves to make each look better.

This is one of Troma's better DVD releases. I only wish it were possible to give it more than 5 stars.",1139184000,3,1803,4.396396396396397
