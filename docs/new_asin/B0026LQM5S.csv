8352978,3,B0026LQM5S,"This video is the same exact video distributed by Chrome Dreams Media Productions, a London based company in 2005.  Silver and Gold Productions just slapped on a new cover and started distributing it this year (2009).

Other than that, it's a pretty good documentary, although they didn't have any more information than what a serious Depeche Mode fan already knows.",1253491200,7,366,5.083333333333333
