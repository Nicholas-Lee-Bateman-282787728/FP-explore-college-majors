5047496,5,B0071LEG0G,"We have all of these DVDs.  My children love to watch them in the car on trips to grandparents.  My husband and I even find ourselves listening to the information and learning something new.  Beware - some of the songs will stick in your head ALL DAY LONG!  Our 5 year old has watched the videos since she was 2 and has enjoyed them at every stage.  As she gets older she discovers and understands more of the information and humor... so she can definitely grow with these DVDs.  Our second child is starting out on the same path of loving them, too.",1452643200,,550,4.29126213592233

5047524,5,B0071LEG0G,"The Writings were handled with wit, humor and lots of good information.  I was impressed with the discussion of Job.  The Song of Solomon was appropriate.  I wish the Ecclesiastes discussion had highlighted the contrast between ""under the sun"" and ""Under heaven"".  Proverbs and Psalms were also excellent.",1429747200,,305,5.291666666666667
5047525,5,B0071LEG0G,"What's in the Bible? is a series designed to teach the Bible to kids via 13 one hour lessons and puppets.  Obviously this isn't a comprehensive view of the Bible, but an introduction that teaches the important themes of each book and what that teaches us about God.  The 8th volume just came out.  Entitled Words to Make Us Wise, it focuses on the poetry books of the Old Testament.

Now I've got to admit I wondered how these would be covered.  These books would be hard to teach kids because there isn't much in the way of stories.  But creator Phil Vischer (the man behind the original VeggieTales) proves that he can get the job done with another entertaining video.

As always, there are two half hour lessons on this DVD, and between the two of them, we cover 5 books of the Bible.  First up, we learn about these poetry books and why it is important to know the difference between history and poetry.  (After all, one of the books here compares God to a bird.)

Job is obviously the easiest book to cover since there is a story to it.  I was a little unhappy with the discussion of parts of it (seems to not want to take the pose parts as metaphorical as well as the poetry parts), but the conclusion was certainly right on.  Then we head to Psalms and learn about the praise God of Israel and how some of those Psalms are the basis of the hymns we use today.

The second episode takes us through the wisdom of Proverbs (and how that is different from smarts), Ecclesiastes and the meaning of life, and finally the love poem that is Song of Solomon.

I was most interested in how they would cover that last book.  After all, it is a love poem and these videos are aimed at kids.  I've got to say, this may have been the funniest thing they've done for any of the videos ever.  Between the talk about the comparisons in the book (your hair is like a flock of goats) and the characters' reactions to the ""mushy stuff,"" it was a riot.

Of course, the entire video is filled with some jokes along with the information.  I found it entertaining, and I'm well beyond the early elementary target age.  They do keep the songs to a minimum, which helps.  Those are always the weakest part of the episodes.

What always amazes me is that Phil Vischer performs all the puppets himself.  How does he make all those voices without losing his?  It's amazing, but I never find any weaknesses there.

So we've got an entertaining hour on five books that kids probably won't be that familiar with at all and context to help them understand what they will find there.  This is the exactly what the series tries to do, and it succeeds perfectly.  What's in the Bible? Volume 8: Words to Make Us Wise is a great addition to the series.",1429660800,,2722,4.349206349206349
5047526,5,B0071LEG0G,I love this series!! Sooooo great!,1429488000,,34,4.833333333333333
5047527,5,B0071LEG0G,"excellent, informative product . Blessings to the producers for making such a entertaining, accurate, and helpful series which translates Biblical content for audiences in a reverent, yet fun way. very worth-while to purchase for our children (and families).",1421798400,,258,5.815789473684211
5047528,5,B0071LEG0G,"Action, bright colors, animation, and some nice puppets along with lots of music, all make it easier to understand the Bible. That is what this Whats in the Bible? series is about.

Volume 8 deals with the books of poetry, called the Writings. It gives and overview of the books of Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon.

Trusting God even when life is hard to understand happens in the book of Job. The Bibles songbook, Psalms, and the different types of psalms are covered, both in the first episode. It's about 25 minutes in length.

Episode 2 introduces Proverbs, telling the difference these brief poetic sayings and promises. It also briefly covers Ecclesiastes, about what can seem to be the pointlessness of life, and the Song of Solomon (mushy, mushy, mushy sings the puppet Ian), about romantic love.

This volume also describes what the poetry in the Bible is like, and why knowing we are reading poetry helps out interpretations.

Each volume in this series has a flyer inside with a page of suggestions to help parents talk to their children. Whats the difference between being smart and being wise is one question to discuss for this volume. Each also has a sheet to color of the cover picture on the DVD. There is also a web site for finding more Whats in the Bible? activities.

This approximately 1-hour DVD does an excellent job of covering the Bible's five books written in poetry.",1418342400,,1419,4.771428571428571

5047544,5,B0071LEG0G,"I can not SAY ENOUGH about this series. I was really looking for a curriculum that my 12 yr. old and 8 yr. old could enjoy together, but this is something even my husband and I enjoy too!

We have 1-10 now and are ordering the rest. This is something we watch as a family and discuss it as part of our weekly family bible study. It has facts and history that my husband and I (both 'church kids', and I am a PK) haven't even heard before.

I am most impressed at how it gives the great overview of covenant, showing what even most adults don't see, the thread that runs through the entire bible from sin to salvation. We just finished the first New Testament DVD #10 and can not wait to get to the others. My only worry is that we are catching up to the series and will have to wait for others to come out. =)

8508396,5,B0071LEG0G,"Mushy Mushy mushy stuffs. HAHA The series is great for using clips for my children church to explain a few items. As well it's nice for me to watch. Often if I'm not using the video I'll use other resources from the What's in the Bible Website. Big Idea has not been the same since Phil Vischer left for various reasons but at least he is still working on Kid's Shows. My husband laughed at the explanation of Song of Solomon and said well ""What do you expect from the Man that wrote 'King George and the Rubber Ducky' AKA David and Bathsheba. Buck Denver Asks: What's in the Bible a is great seires for Adults and Children. It is still only Surface scrattching and you should digg deepper with your children on your time. BUT it is great for starting conversations having some explations. AND SONGS! Songs I cannot stress enough help you remember what you've learned. Young children love songs and will sing them over and over it maybe YEARS later they get what the song was about but it helps.
I am probually be like one of those College Kids that got VeggieTales moving but I will say this You will want to see the next one in the series if you start at the very beginning. My opps moment I started my husband in the middle he says meh to the series; but he is happy to sit with me and watch as I watch for uses and well as just plan fun. Again I use clips for starting up or explaintions to the Children at church. It grabs their attention and starts some discusstions even if it's on how Pizza isn't in the Bible I know they are paying attention.",1464825600,,1551,4.261016949152542
