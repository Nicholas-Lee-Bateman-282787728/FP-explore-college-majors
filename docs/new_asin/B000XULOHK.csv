3008278,5,B000XULOHK,"I have always worked out, but the cardios were too fast and eventually caused me long term joint pain.  I also have fibromyalgia and can't take the medication.  Working out to a slower paced work out starting with warm ups, slower cardio and cool down, was just what I needed.  Also, being able to choose the length of the work out also helps.  There are days I can due a full 30 minutes and others when I can only do 15.

I sit at a computer for a good portion of the day and I really need a way to keep my body strong and limber.  Okay, I may not get abs of steel from this, but at my age, who cares.",1370390400,5,602,3.8934426229508197
3008279,5,B000XULOHK,"I love this workout.  I started from sedentary and used every one of the baby step workouts along the way.  When I felt I had mastered this workout, I tried Zumba and was AMAZED at how well-prepared I was for such a different style and pace.  I was 58 years old when I started this and one of the 2 oldest ladies at Zumba, and was able to keep up with all the youngsters with no trouble.  A wonderful transitional workout and one I still go back to when I am feeling any pain from over doing.  I highly recommend this for ladies of any age and weight.  I start it at over 200 pounds.",1358380800,3,583,4.026086956521739

3008283,5,B000XULOHK,I think this exercise routine is perfect for someone(like me) who has not exercised in a long time and needs to get up and start.  It starts with a warm up and then increases in 5 minute sections that you move along to at your own pace.  The routine is easy and not boring and has definitely helped me feel less stiff and more energized.,1217289600,6,337,4.1692307692307695
3008284,4,B000XULOHK,"Good dvd for those starting back into exercise.  Just when you start to feel the difference, your exercise is over.  These are not different exercises; each one just builds on the previous.  I would recommend it for those who do little to no exercise.",1215820800,11,251,4.659090909090909

I didn't really think I'd be having a good time with this, but from the first five-minute segment, Mirabai made me know I knew could do it.  I just did a little bit at a time until I could do the whole thing:  warm up, cardio, stretching, cardio, stretching and cool down.  Bang!  I got up to the 30 minutes in a couple of weeks, and now it's the quickest 30 minutes of my day.",1208476800,21,806,6.035087719298246
3008286,5,B000XULOHK,"The Ease-in video is an excellent introduction for both beginners and people who have not exercised recently.  Mirabai's introduction is informative as to the benefits of exercise to both your body and health in general.

Beginning with the 5 minute warm-up each segment is slow and very easy to follow.  As you move on to the additional segments, it continues to be slow and not overwhelming, nor is it intimidating.

Since Mirabai makes it all look very easy to follow and understand, I know that I will continue to use this to build up my stamina and go on to additional excercise.",1205712000,4,584,4.696078431372549
3008287,3,B000XULOHK,"This just wasn't the right video for me, so I gave it to my 79 year old mother.  I think it will be perfect for her to use when she can't get outside to walk.  It does have nice music and the setting is beautiful, but this wasn't enough of a workout for me and there wasn't enough variety within the workout.  Also, each segment could have been varied instead of just a shorter version of the same thing.  Many exercise instructors get on my nerves and I have to say Mirabai doesn't; she keeps talking to a minimum, which I like.  I want something more challenging than this one, but not a superhuman hour-long killer workout with a lot of jumping around.  I'll just keep looking.",1202428800,10,680,4.31496062992126

8229831,5,B000XULOHK,"I just received this dvd today, and I already did the 20 minute workout. I lead several exercise groups at our local senior center, and this will be perfect. It is just enough to raise everyone's heart rates while still allowing the beginners and newcomers to ease into the exercise.
I thank the reviewer who gave the tip about cleaning the sticky goo on the dvd with rubbing alcohol. My dvd also arrived with lots of gooey spots. I cleaned it with alcohol on a microfiber cloth, moving from the center to the edge. It now works perfectly.",1500422400,,539,4.510204081632653
8229832,5,B000XULOHK,"I really like this workout.  Some of her other workouts are a little too much, but this is great.  I do it every morning for my heart and must say I enjoy it! The music is just really pleasant-more like an island vacation, unlike most exercise DVD's that are blaring and annoying,  watching the waves in the background, the exercises easy to follow.  Of course I hope there will be more like this, for variety.",1497225600,,410,4.426666666666667
8229833,5,B000XULOHK,"I've been trying for what seems like forever to find an exercise program that I would actually stick with and believe me, I've tried EVERYTHING:  Jane Fonda, Joanie Greggains, Esquire's Great Body series, Karen Voight, Leslie Sansone, Aerobic Dancing, Latin Dancing, Jazzercise, Balletcise, Zumba, Tai Chi, Tai Cheng, Pilates, Yoga.  You name it and I've tried it and then dropped it after a week or two.  This is the one exercise program that has kept me coming back day after day and gotten me into pretty darn good shape.  I've already moved to Level 1 and have no doubt that I'll be at level 2 by 2017.  I love the setting, the music and the instructor - well, everything about this DVD is wonderful!  If you want to get in shape but don't want to suffer, like me, I highly recommend the Moving Free series..  (FYI regarding the sticky residue that people mentioned finding on the 'Ease-in' DVD'S.  There is no need to return the DVD - it is simple to remove and then the DVD will play perfectly.  Just moisten a microfiber cloth with rubbing alcohol and wipe the DVD from the center hole straight across to the outside edge (making sure NOT to wipe it in a circular motion).",1467849600,2,1179,4.549763033175355
8229834,3,B000XULOHK,Mixed feelings on this one. The exercises are great if you are very out of shape and just starting a program or if you are recovering from an injury. (Exactly why I got it.) But there seems to be a problem with the manufacturing process of the DVDs. I've had to return 2 of them because of a sticky residue on the DVD which causes it to not work.,1459641600,,346,4.028985507246377
8229835,5,B000XULOHK,Great for inexperienced older women who are timid about exercise in general like my dear friend.  Easy and non-frenetic instructions.,1445990400,,133,5.65
8229836,1,B000XULOHK,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to view the DVD.  I didn't open it immediately, but when I did it was damaged with spotting and would not play.  Lesson learned:  immediately open and try so the option to return doesn't expire!!!",1425340800,,225,4.717948717948718

8229839,4,B000XULOHK,I spent a lot of time on the net researching a suitable program. Mirabai is easy to follow and encouraging.  I am currently have been doing her 20 minute program for about 2 weeks and feel good after it - looking forward to getting to the final 30 minute segment.  I will definitely purchase another one of her DVD's when I feel that I have got on top of this one. I have already recommended this DVD to two of my friends.,1396396800,2,422,4.134146341463414
8229840,4,B000XULOHK,"This is really good for Seniors, like myself. It really gets me going in the a.m. if I just stop and take the time to go through the exercise. I like it very much, found it most helpful.",1385769600,2,186,3.9210526315789473
