2069072,5,B00028G78E,The title should have told me not to get this DVD but because of one actress I did get it. This movie was of its time. Still I am glad I got to be sure I didn't miss any good movies from this one star. Thanks for shipping it out so quickly!,1374710400,,240,3.6346153846153846
2069073,4,B00028G78E,"Well, I've read the few reviews about this title and only one seemed to coincide with my feelings.  My review is not on the quality of the DVD for I have never seen the DVD.  My review is on the film in which I haven't seen in almost 10 years.  Keep in mind, this is from what I remember.

I was going over to a buddy's house one night and he had rented some movies for a few of us to watch.  The Fifth Element, which was new to video at the time, and Bimbo Movie Bash.  ""Bimbo Movie Bash?!"" I said to him on the phone.  ""It looks like it could be good.""  He tells me.  ""Sounds like a cheep T&A movie to me.""  I tell him.  He grew up in Africa and had no idea what ""bimbo"" meant.

Later that evening, a few of us are sitting around trying to figure out what to do.  There were some girls in the crowd, now the wives of the guys they were with.  ""Let's see what this Bimbo Movie Bash is about"" someone says.  We pop in the tape, it starts to play and a giant boob is coming toward the screen.  ""What is this crap?!"" one of the girls says.  Which of course led to us turning off the tape.

Later that night, the girls left and we were done watching The Fifth Element.  ""Let's see what that movie is about again."" someone suggests.  I'm not sure what it was, maybe bad pizza, maybe too much caffeine at 1:00am, but we were in tears from the very first minute, to the very last.

I would be willing to bet that the bad reviews on this title were people who didn't get it.  This is not a compilation of the ""best scenes"" from any of these films.  The films depicted were so awful that they couldn't possible have a best scene.  No, this is a compilation of these horrible films that is intended 100% to make fun of just how crappy they are.  Hence the title, Bimbo Movie ""Bash"".

The Bash in no way means a party, it means that they are going to bash these movies down for what they are (or were).  Easy and guilt free porn for people who would rather get their kicks on late night Showtime than go to the adult book store.  With a hint of terrible story telling.

Take the scene where Bill Maher pushes a girl off of a building ledge before he runs off to do whatever.  In the actual movie, it looks like she falls into an abyss as she disappears off camera.  What do the creators of Bimbo Movie Bash do?  They make her appear to be falling through several different scenes during the movie.

What about the random shower scenes?  They never made any sense in the crappy originals, so the creators of Bimbo Movie Bash made them make even less sense here.  Popping them up on the screen when a character is mid sentences in some instances.

Or a girl running down a path.  When she gets to a fork, she looks left, then right, then left and so on.  Each scene showed the same path over and over again.  Similar to Monty Pythons The Holy Grail.

Now, is this movie a life changer?  Well, it actually was for my friends and me.  We still to this day quote the things we remember.  Most notably a scene where a man is seen running through a warehouse and looks almost like a kid pretending to be Thomas The Tank Engine.  The film makers capitalized on this by dubbing in the line, ""Hey everybody look!  I'm a train!  Chugga chugga.""  The scene ends and the (lack of) story continues.  Whenever myself, or any of the friends who were there find themselves shuffling along, that line is still quoted.  Ten years later!

Something about this film actually made a mark on us and I think it will be there till the day we die.  Honestly, how many blockbusters that come out these days can do that to you?  I commend the makers of Bimbo Movie Bash for giving the films they used the lack of respect they deserve.  And in turn, giving those that got it, a great and entertaining low budget spoof to enjoy.

As for the quality of the DVD I can't speak on it.  I will still most likely purchase it if it drops to $5.  This is not Star Wars.  I think that the poor quality might even add to the cheesiness of the film.  As long as I can see and hear the movie and the jokes are all still there, I'll be happy.  Or maybe I'll be just as disappointed as Full Mooner.  I'm just hoping that this is not better in the memory like Never Ending Story.

Final thoughts after a winded review, if you like cheese and get where the makers of this spoof are coming from, you will enjoy it.  If you're looking to get your rocks off to really, really bad B-T&A Movies, this is not for you.

EDIT: Since writing this original review I did Netflix the DVD.  All speculation of optimism towards the quality has been destroyed.  As I said, as long as I can see and hear the jokes, I'd be good.  Well, you can barely see anything on the screen let alone make out half of what is being said.  This is beyond poor quality.  Looks like and sounds like a copy of a copy of a copy of a....",1214870400,5,4845,4.115631691648822

2069075,1,B00028G78E,"I sincerely hope the clown who supervised this transfer has been demoted to cleaning toilets or shoveling excrement of some sort.  Incompetence like this is unacceptable.  I own better than 1000 DVDs, about half of which are budget DVDs I purchased for a dollar or thereabouts.  This DVD, however, has by far the worst transfer I have ever seen.  I copied this movie from cable to a cheap video cassette (EP mode) eight years ago, and that old tape looks a hell of a lot better than this embarrasment.  The picture is jittery whenever movement is present on the screen, and the color looks totally washed out.  Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!  Great movie...pick it up on VHS.",1144281600,18,684,4.603305785123967

However the editors did a sloppy job of splicing the movies together to form ""nothing of value"". I am not sure it is even good for a shopping reference film as there is not enough meat to make a decision.
