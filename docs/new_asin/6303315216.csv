7844298,4,6303315216,This is a pretty good werewolf movie which was made for TNT I believe and has a pretty good plot. The acting is good and the monster does look scary. I mean a werewolf covered in a metal skin called Bioferrin with big red eyes? Creepy. If I saw this thing in real life I would have nightmares. Good B movie. This one should be considered for a DVD release.,1332028800,3,356,4.1
7844299,4,6303315216,"The werewolf is always portrayed as the vampire's poor bastard cousin.  Recent films such as the ""Underworld"" series underscore this unfair attitude.  I always thought werewolves were much cooler.

The 1994 film ""Project: Metalbeast"" is one that many of us first saw on the Sci Fi (now Syfy) network.  One of the very best low-budget films ever to be shown on the network (they've made and shown some real dogs in their day), this has winning acting from Kim Delaney and Barry Bostwick, a terrific premise, and one hell of an indestructible monster. If you like werewolf films, you've got to see this one.

And if only the Prism VHS is available, it's not copy protected, so you can burn a DVD from it.  I did with my Go Video combo recorder, and it came out beautifully.

The other reviews tell you the plot, so I need not rehash that.  Suffice to say that it is a great thrill ride, and if you love horror films in general, and werewolf films specifically, you'll love this one.",1312675200,,980,4.528409090909091
7844300,3,6303315216,"The first time I saw this movie was on tv, SciFi channel. I didn't have much hope that it would be any good but was very surprised! The acting is fine, for a low budget horror movie, and the special effects are not all that bad. The story is very interesting and original as well. A team of scientist are trying to prefect a new synthetic skin but they have been having problems. After a short period of time the skin hardens and it becomes like steel. well this military coronal, the project leader tells them to work on a cadaver that he supplies. They do, he comes back to life and turns out to be a werewolf, now with really hard hide.

If you like horror movies especially werewolves and don't mind it being low budge, than this is a gem!",1132185600,5,743,4.232394366197183
