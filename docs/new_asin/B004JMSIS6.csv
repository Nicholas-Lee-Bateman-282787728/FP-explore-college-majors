4391068,1,B004JMSIS6,"This about as bad as a Blu-Ray disc can get.  Warner Brothers has really cut corners here.  I'd give it a negative star rating if I could.  The only thing I can say for this edition is, at least it's widescreen.  The audio for Arthur is worse than mono, it's center speaker only.  The video quality is fair at best.  Too bad.  Like so many American companies, quality doesn't seem to be important.  No wonder no one wants to buy american, today.  Arthur 2 is okay as sequels go, but at least that sound track is stereo.  Save your money and wait for something better.  If you really want to see this movie, again, rent it.  The DVD isn't much better.",1313193600,4,650,4.2809917355371905
4391069,5,B004JMSIS6,"I have tried to find a widescreen version of ARTHUR. I saw it was widescreen on Blu-Ray and bought it. Wonderful transfer. ARTHUR 2 was terrible in theaters. But, the widescreen ARTHUR is fabulous and ARTHUR 2, that I put off watching, is also very good. Dudley Moore was perfect for both features. Glad I decided to watch them both. A real collectible.",1311552000,2,353,4.619047619047619
4391070,3,B004JMSIS6,"The disk worked fine, but my only complaint was that both movies are on one disk. I was a little confused at first. I guess it is fine, just a little strange.",1305244800,3,158,3.96875
4391071,4,B004JMSIS6,"It was a good deal for the money (two films on Blu-Ray for under $15).  I watched the first movie and didn't feel ripped off like I did watching some other Blu-Rays (First Blood and Total Recall), but was not impressed.  The video quality was okay, but not great (I suspect better than a standard DVD).  There was little or no grain, but it just did not look that great.  But, it was okay for a movie that old, and at that price.  The audio was ""DTS-HD Master Audio"", but was in MONO!  What is the point of that?

I put in the second movie (Arthur 2) and immediately noticed grain.  I didn't think it looked as good as the first movie.  I skipped through it, and there was grain throughout the movie.  But still, probably better than a standard DVD, which I have never seen.  Grain just bothers me.  I don't think you should see it on a Blu-Ray disc.  The second movie had stereo sound at least, which was still a disappointment, but better than the original Arthur (first movie).

Still a good deal at this price, unless you are a big fan of the ""Arthur"" movies.",1303862400,10,1063,4.276381909547739
4391072,1,B004JMSIS6,"Such a great, GREAT film (I'm referring to the original Arthur, not Arthur 2, PLEASE no Arthur 2!), but the Blu-ray leaves a LOT to be desired.

Since when do RECENT Blu-ray releases of a MULTIPLE OSCAR WINNING FILM get released with 1.0 (yes, you read that right) audio on the Blu-ray?  How is this acceptable??

Truly a shame for such a great film.  It deserved a better release, and has for years now.",1302739200,12,404,4.418918918918919

I even checked my firmare update, Tried several different ways, No luck..Hope Amazon will take care of the problem . I love the Arthur movies.  Update My son inlaw who is very good at this stuff, took him over an hour to get the audio in english on arthur two, they should have the audio in 5.1 digitaly remastered, instead of mono and 2.0. Shame cause Arthur is great movie. I'd prefer to buy them seperatly on bluray but they only come in one disk.",1302393600,6,585,4.318181818181818
4391074,5,B004JMSIS6,"The Brothers Warner had this slated for release back in 2005 for ARTHUR's 25th Anniversary, so really this is the 25th Anniversary Edition thirty years on.  To see this comedy classic in its original widescreen splendor for the first time since its run in theaters is a real gas, and Warner's generous helping of extras makes this one more than worth the wait -- it's the most fun money can buy!",1300838400,,395,4.563380281690141

The picture quality has not improved.  Was so looking forward to it.  Had a feeling since the two movies were both on one disc, that might've been the case, but hoped for better.  Movie is definitely five star but the redo on bluray stinks.",1454457600,4,411,4.342105263157895

4391100,5,B004JMSIS6,"I love this film and on the surface it may not sound like anything special, underneath is a very touching, smart and funny film. The writing and performances are brilliant with absolutely flawless timing by all.  Watching the film on Blu Ray I was amazed how many lines I quote from this film,  there is at least one per scene.

Dudley Moore plays the drunken Arthur to perfection making him fun and sympathetic rather than an obnoxious bore. John Gielgud is superb as Arthur's acid tongued butler who won an Oscar (and deservingly so) for his performance. Liza Minnelli's comic timing with Moore and Gielgud is priceless. Geraldine Fitzgerald and the rest of the cast are all in top form in this delightfully comedy. The new Blu Ray release isn't going to blow anyone away, but it looks better than it ever has on home video and probably better than it ever will. The same goes for the sound, this film never had a blistering soundtrack and the Blu Ray is simple and clear.

Part of the problem is that films from the 80's seem to have a soft look to them to begin with. The film does look very good though and I think it's worth upgrading because the film is a classic. There are no extras, but we do get the disappointing sequel. Lightning was caught in a  bottle the first time and things would have been better off left alone. A classic comedy that is smart insightful and totally hilarious!",1396915200,5,1396,4.5019762845849804
4391101,5,B004JMSIS6,Arthur and Arthur 2 grammar to add to my blueray collection that are really great movies to watch over and over Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli make you laugh and really are great actors. It's a classic treat to own finally on. Blueray!,1396656000,,235,4.488372093023256

4391103,2,B004JMSIS6,"This review concerns the quality of the blu-ray, not the content of the motion pictures.

This ""2-Movie Collection"" hits the pavement as a ""1-Blu-Ray Disc"" in extended play mode.  That is, both movies are on 1-side of a single blu-ray disc and in doing so, the 1080p resolution is significantly diminished.  In fact, when I compared it to a DVD from the ""Three Stooges Ultimate Collection,"" the Three Stooges DVD looked as good as Arthur.  That's a huge compliment for the Stooges, but an unfortunate blow to Dudley Moore fans who, like me, love this film.  I hate to say it, but this is the worst looking blu-ray from the many I have seen.  The resolution just isn't there.

Conclusion:  1 star because the blu-ray did function (the audio was ok); 1 star for value, but zero stars for the presentation of the material.

As a postscript, it is troubling that value-minded marketeers are now diminishing the excellent quality of the blu-ray format.  Blu-ray as a format has had a relatively slow rate of household penetration compared to DVD.  The blu-ray format is finally beginning to take hold, but it is a giant step backward to release films in a blu-ray of only moderate resolution.  If this becomes a trend, buyers may decide blu-ray does not really hold a meaningful advantage over DVD (many commercial DVDs are recorded in 480p), and this will slow the popularity of blu-rays.",1389312000,3,1384,4.76890756302521
4391104,5,B004JMSIS6,"While I don't find the second ""Aurthur"" move to be quite as funny as the first, I think that it is every bit as good. I would also say that it is at least a thousand times better than the new re-make . . . although the floating bed in the new one is a bit more impressive than the train set in the old one.

I found the Blu-Ray set to be a good addition to my collection, although it is a shame there isn't more leftover footage (I was hoping for out-takes) and special features. However, at the time it was filmed it wasn't that common to keep that stuff. Since there weren't any DVD's, there just wasn't any reason. Great all-time classic movie, though.",1371686400,2,655,4.15748031496063

4391110,5,B004JMSIS6,"The Dudley Moore Arthur has to be one of the true classics. After watching the new Arthur, updated references for the current generation, we were even more impressed with the original Arthur. Our kids have now seen both versions and laughed during each one. Given the many references in the original Arthur we were glad to see the kids really liked the movie.

Given the age of the movie and other reviews were were not sure about the Blu-ray version. We are happy to say the image quality is really good; sure, maybe not the same as a modern movie (is that to be expected?). Now that we have a copy on blu-ray we are sure to keep this classic movie viewable for years to come.

Watching Arthur2 for the first time was entertaining. Not the same Arthur as the original, yet still entertaining.

8431950,5,B004JMSIS6,"I have really enjoyed ""ARTHUR"" throughout the years when it first came out in 1981. Dudley Moore was and always will be a great comedian with some great one liners. I was pleased to see these movies get a Bluray release. WB put both movies on the same bluray disc because they could probably save some $ in production costs, etc. These are vintage '80s comedies, so there you go.
I thought the quality for them was decent, but overall maybe could have been better. Still better than previous releases, though. I played it on my Sony upscaling 4K bluray player and the resolution came out to be 2160p. A nice improvement over 1080p.
The only ""Special Feature"" on both of these movies is the Theatrical Trailer. I really wished they could have had some vintage ""featurettes"" on them, like that of ""10"". Oh well, I will take these anyhow.
""Arthur"" was more hilarious, but I enjoyed the sequel as well.
If you like '80s comedies, you may like these, too!  A good deal for two movies on bluray!",1489017600,,989,4.5251396648044695
