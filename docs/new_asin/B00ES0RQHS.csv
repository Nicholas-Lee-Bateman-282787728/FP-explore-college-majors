5935167,5,B00ES0RQHS,I will forever love River Phoenix. This is a great movie. Love the note from director/actor William Richert.,1464998400,,108,5.055555555555555
5935168,5,B00ES0RQHS,"So worth it!  It arrived sooner than expected.  A personalized, signed note from the director of the film and close friend of River Phoenix was included, which I will treasure always.  Also inlcuded was an additional dvd of Mr. Richert's film ""Success"".  River Phoenix is especially beautiful in this film, angst ridden and funny!  He plays the perfect combination of both.  So much charisma & believability.  He creates a memorable, real character.  So thrilled to be able to find and see this film after so many years.  Thank you to Bill Richert for keeping River's wonderful portrayal of Jimmy available to us! ",1458086400,5,614,4.931372549019608
5935169,5,B00ES0RQHS,"This is a DVD-R and is NOT an official release!! It does not mention this anywhere in the item's description. Also, the packaging/artwork doesn't look much like what they have shown here.

That said, it is the only original version of the Jimmy Reardon movie I've been able to find anywhere. The quality of the transfer is good enough to be satisfied with. Worth $20.",1441843200,3,367,4.6461538461538465

5935171,5,B00ES0RQHS,"The changes and additions the director's cut made Jimmy Reardon a better movie.  The most surprising part was the DVD came with a personal letter from William Richert thanking me for my purchase plus another movie of his and a cd with River's Song on it.  I haven't had a chance to check out the additional movie and music but I'm happy to have received it.  I've been a fan of River since Stand By Me was in theaters, it's very special to me to have a letter from someone who was so close to him when he was alive.",1408320000,6,515,4.13
5935172,5,B00ES0RQHS,"I DISCOVERED TWO REVIEWS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH -- HERE IS THE FIRST ONE: William Richert presents the world premiere of his director's cut of JIMMY REARDON -- AREN'T YOU EVEN GONNA KISS ME GOODBYE? The original version is an utterly unexpected delight, writer-director Richert's bravura toast, in maturity, to the power, the glory, the turmoil and the heartbreak of adolescence --a salute as sweet as a double Manhattan with twice the kick. As River Phoenix plays him, 17-year-old Jimmy Reardon is a very hardy boy indeed.  He combines the ingenuity of Tom Sawyer, the deviousness of Duddy Kravitz, the yearning of Holden Caulfield, the frustrated passion of ""The Graduate's"" Benjamin and the sheer randy exuberance of Henry Miller in his Paris days.",1378166400,3,752,5.1138211382113825
8608837,5,B00ES0RQHS,The director's cut was much more relevant than what I recalled of this back in the day.  Whoever did the original editing did not impress me much but this is a good coming of age and realizing the importance of family film.,1529366400,,223,4.309523809523809
8608838,1,B00ES0RQHS,A lame and predictable plot line with poor acting all around,1517529600,,60,4.545454545454546
8608839,4,B00ES0RQHS,"a nice film to see that steers away from the classic teen movies centering around high school mean girls and golden boys. what's crazy to me about this film is that River Phoenix started filming this movie just 3 months after Stand By Me! its astonishing how he transformed his character and physical appearance, he was 14 or 15 at the time. River Phoenix also wrote an original song in this film that plays at the end. Overall, I enjoyed seeing the main character grow and learn to understand himself--and his parents.",1516233600,,519,4.6521739130434785
8608840,5,B00ES0RQHS,"I had always wanted to see this River Phoenix movie and I've read it has been released in the original cut from the director. It's clever, charming, and surprisingly smart for a movie that was edited down to be cheesy. This is definitely a film that is worth seeing for the revised cut.",1505952000,5,286,4.415094339622642
8608841,5,B00ES0RQHS,Was looking for this movie and you guys had it.  Thanks.,1493683200,,56,4.090909090909091
8608842,5,B00ES0RQHS,"I'm so excited to have received this DVD, I love it so much. Thank you, Mr. Richert, for giving me the opportunity to have your cut of Jimmy Reardon, I feel so lucky. River means the world to me and I will always love this movie. The personalized letter is displayed prominently in my room, such a cool thing to have. Thank you not only for the DVD, but for making the movie, releasing this version, and for keeping your friend River's accomplishments in circulation.",1490659200,,467,4.5058823529411764
8608843,5,B00ES0RQHS,"Very enjoyable movie, send to me with a personal note from the Director.. Very happy, it was worth the wait.",1485993600,,108,4.45
8608844,5,B00ES0RQHS,"I have always loved this movie, and this version is the best one. I enjoyed watching it how was intended to be released.  I was a huge  River Phoenix fan as a teenager and was 15 when this was first released in 88.  I owned it on VHS at the time, but it, and all my other River collections, faded away with time, growing up, and multiple moves.  Now I am slowly collecting them all again and so glad I found this version of Jimmy Reardon.  As always, River's acting is outstanding, and while this role differed from the ones he had previously done, it was nice seeing a different side of his acting skills.

My order got lost in the mail somehow, but I contacted the company via Amazon, and received a response within a day or so. They shipped another out, and I had it within a week.  The personalized, handwritten note from director William Richert was extra special. He even personally apologized for the ""snafu"", which made me smile.  I can't wait to watch the bonus DVD he included in the package as well.  Great service, great movie.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.",1475020800,,1080,4.436548223350254
8608845,5,B00ES0RQHS,Richard is an awesome guy. I would really like to meet him.,1474070400,,59,4.0
8608846,5,B00ES0RQHS,"I've never seen the version of this film that was released in the 80s as I wanted to see the original made by William Richert and River Phoenix before Fox reconceptualised the whole thing.  Believe me, William Richert's version doesn't disappoint - it's an amazing cast with a great script - a little darker than your average teen movie but more enjoyable because of this.  I particularly enjoyed the sections with the River and Ann Magnuson character's and how these all intertwine with other threads running throughout the film and add up to the final slightly surprising outcome.  If you haven't yet seen this film I highly recommend it - it's well worth a watch.",1468195200,,666,4.773913043478261
