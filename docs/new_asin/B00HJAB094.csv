6166779,3,B00HJAB094,"""CSI"" Producer Brings Us a Public Service Announcement Through ""Cybergeddon""

Eric Shirey, Yahoo Contributor Network
You can't ask for better promotion than having the words ""From the Creator of 'CSI'"" gracing the cover of your DVD. That tagline alone gives credibility to any project and guarantees it will be considered by audiences looking for something new to watch as they thumb through movie titles at the local Redbox or DVD rental store. The real question is, ""Can 'Cybergeddon' deliver on the promise of quality it prominently shouts at you from its box art?""

Keyboard and desk jockey Chloe Jocelyn (Missy Peregrym) settles down into an office job for the FBI after capturing cyber-terrorist Gustav Dobreff (Olivier Martinez) and imprisoning him. Chloe is knocked out of her comfort zone when she's framed for a series of international digital attacks. Forced to make a run for it, Chloe recruits a hacker (Kick Gurry) she put in prison to help clear her name and track down Gustav, who she believes is committing the cyber-crimes using her as a patsy.

""Cybergeddon"" was originally an online series split into several ten minute webisodes. Strangely, I couldn't really tell. If anything, it came across as a failed TV-pilot or the first entry in a planned series of TV-movies tailor-made for the SyFy Channel, TNT, or Lifetime. It's not bad and keeps you entertained, but doesn't hold the qualities needed to merit a theatrical release.

Missy Peregrym is suitable as FBI Agent Chloe Jocelyn. She's believable as both a physically active and pencil-pushing operative of a government agency. She can handle herself both behind a desk in high-heels and a business suit and in a tank-top, jeans, and combat boots. Olivier Martinez gets to participate in a little hand-to-hand combat as well, but is mostly wasted giving orders behind a computer screen throughout the entire film. Most people will recognize Martinez from his latest role on the TV series ""Revenge"" and as the foreign love interest of Diane Lane in ""Unfaithful.""

There are some things about ""Cybergeddon"" that rub me the wrong way. The first one being it feels like a giant commercial for Norton Anti-virus. Norton and Symantec logos are strewn throughout the film. Although a lot of what was shared in regards to online security was useful and true, I started to feel like I was watching a late-night infomercial after a while.

Another complaint is how unbelievable ""Cybergeddon"" is in some parts. The scene that bothered me the most was when the FBI locks Chloe in an interrogation room after taking her into custody for cyber-terrorism. They leave her in the room with a cell phone after questioning her. She hacks the security systems of the building and escapes. Yeah, right! The FBI would leave a suspect with computer capabilities in a room with her cell phone? I don't think so!

""Cybergeddon"" is rated PG-13 for some violence and language. Most of the violence is action-oriented with a little bloodshed. The obscenities are what I remember as being the main reason for the rating. If you're used to network television shows, there's nothing here that should shock you.

I guess I should answer the question posted earlier. Does ""Cybergeddon"" live up to the ""From the Creator of 'CSI'"" unspoken stamp of approval it holds on its DVD cover? I would say probably not. ""CSI"" is a show held in such high esteem that I can't imagine its audience accepting this pedestrian entry into the world of action/thrillers as anything more than a way to pass the time while hanging out with the family on the weekend or getting work of some kind done.",1397606400,4,3620,4.932676518883415

6166788,1,B00HJAB094,"The character behavior was totally unbelievable, motivations made no sense at all, and the ""hacking"" was a joke. Just don't waste your time with this movie.",1405123200,,156,5.038461538461538
6166789,4,B00HJAB094,"First, really tired of people posing as critics and not just critics but experts on movies and tv. Just say what you like or don't like and be done with it - PLEASE!
 Now, Missy Peregrym sure has filled out wonderfully since ""REAPERS"". Really like her in this movie. Actually, it's an edited Internet Series. How did I not hear about this?
Really enjoyed this movie. No high expectations just wanted some fun entertainment and I got it. Looking forward to watching the complete series to compare differences and see what the real Yelena looks like. IMDb says the character was in 2 episodes but obviously edited out.
 I gave it 4 Stars because of the story edits.",1403740800,6,663,4.610169491525424
6166790,3,B00HJAB094,"Missy Peregrym is nice to watch, but I like her better as the TV cop she played later.
More range exposed on TV than this  direct-to-video release.
Standard , super hacker is out to get us AND the world, and is a bloodthirsty bastard besides.
Sorry, that is a total plot spoiler.
The rest of the movie was 'How we catch em and save the world, narrowly at the last second.'
Ho Hum thriller about computer virus's take the world.",1400371200,,427,4.3375

I thought this was just another ""B"" movie I could watch once to kill time. But I am really glad this is a part of my collection. The story was really good and I appreciate the possibility for a sequel.",1399939200,11,327,3.9696969696969697

8633056,5,B00HJAB094,"The lovely Missy Peregrym!  A darker portrayal of acting skill contrasting with STICK IT.  Just a joy to watch her move and act, smile, and facial mannerisms accompanied by her body!  Four to five times as good in her acting chops as BACKCOUNTRY.  Missy is in par with her character acting in the TV series, ROOKIE BLUE!",1529193600,,320,4.56140350877193
