1236919,5,B00000JQ8J,Brings back childhood memories of watching with family. My grandson can now enjoy some of our favorite shows.,1415923200,,109,5.111111111111111
1236920,5,B00000JQ8J,Takes me back to being a kid and seeing these in school. My Nephew loves watching all the animals.,1414368000,,98,4.2105263157894735
1236921,5,B00000JQ8J,"I loved this series while I was growing up, and it is great to see it preserved in the digital age.",1411689600,,99,3.761904761904762
1236922,5,B00000JQ8J,THE BEST SHOW!!!!! I love it. Marty Stouffer and family are super awesome! :) <3 A+,1406764800,,83,4.25
1236923,5,B00000JQ8J,"Marty Stouffer never fails to make a great program, and this one seems especially loved by kids.  It is purposely contrived with snippets of different wildlife playing and is overdubbed with Marty Stouffer's musings of what those animals might be saying.  My kids LOVE this one!  It is more of a playful set of mini-wildlife adventures than an actual educational nature experience, but it certainly has a place in our home!  It is a positive and natural alternative to cartoons (which only serve to wire my kids and fill their heads with nothing).  This lighter side of wildlife is perfect to intrigue and entertain the young imagination.  Thank you, Marty!",1404864000,,657,4.927272727272728
1236924,5,B00000JQ8J,"My daughter really enjoyed this program, and I remember Marty from my own childhood. Many nature shows present animals as trying to survive, and maybe some babies being playful to prepare them for adulthood survival.
But adult animals can be clumsy, silly, curious, and annoying to their neighbors just as much as the next guy! This special shows that side of wildlife.
I guess the only drawback is that the footage is so old, it's that sort of 70s/80s washed out tone. Once you get into the program though, it's forgotten.",1400371200,,523,4.758241758241758
1236925,5,B00000JQ8J,"Animal lovers will enjoy viewing this humorous look at animal antics time and time again.  Watch what will happen if three raccoon bandits enter a cabin window for some nighttime foraging.  You guessed it.  What a mess!  Watch what happens when the Stouffers get too close to baby bears or baby wolverines at play when they have over protective mothers around.  Have you ever seen a coyote playing catch with itself, a bear playing with a stick, a sea otter waltzing, mice playing train, or otters doing the limbo down a snowy slope?  This video has all this and much more.  Funny commentary accompanied by expressive music and excellent close up cinematography all add up to one great video.  Note:  This commentary was based on 1996 version video of the same title.",997833600,7,767,4.75

7913236,5,B00000JQ8J,"My six year old says ""it's awesome!"" Our entire family, with a range of ages, loves Wild America. We have watched dozens of animal documentary series, such as David Attenborough's various series. Wild America is obviously of a different quality, but it is charming. This particular title, Fantastic Follies, is fun and sweet. We enjoy the cute scenes and humor. Much of our viewing is more scientific and serious, so this is a rather fun diversion. It is exactly what we do when watching a humorous animal at the zoo or in the wild...we narrate their antics. Sometimes, like humans, animals are silly too!",1470873600,,605,4.826923076923077

7913239,2,B00000JQ8J,The bland attempts at humor detract from the beauty and potential laughter inciting moments. Disappointing and probably unwatchable for most,1459987200,,140,6.05
