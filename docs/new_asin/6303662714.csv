7852221,1,6303662714,I enjoyed this movie when it came out so I ordered it  which by the way is hard to find but it would not work on my DVD's  I have 3 of them  I returned it but had to pay double postage  so I don't think I will be ordering anymore DVD's from you,1379030400,,244,3.462962962962963
7852222,5,6303662714,"""Off Beat"" is one of those rare comedies that manages to be silly without being stupid - not an easy task.  Meg Tilly is wonderful as always - and Judge Reinhold is good as well. I hope some more people discover this little gem.",1306713600,,228,4.181818181818182
7852223,4,6303662714,"Meg Tilly sitting in a chair reading the newspaper for an hour and a half gets 3 stars from me so anything that she's in starts from there. This is an okay story, plot, etc but not the best to be honest. She's done better movies but this one's not bad and she does get a good amount of screen time. It will keep you entertained and if you're a fan of Meg Tilly, you'll like it.",1138924800,3,377,3.909090909090909
