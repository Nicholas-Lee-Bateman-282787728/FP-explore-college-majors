5026495,2,B006X040NY,"Having sat through the movie, the plot is barely developed for more than a few minutes. The rest of the time are chase scenes that move through traffic tunnels in Shanghai to gambling in Macau. The whole thing seems to be one dimensional.  Now if you are a teenager maybe that is fine.

The filming is excellent with good camera angles. Both girls are boring and one dimensiosall

The biggest problem is the boring nature of the whole experience.",1351728000,7,446,4.620253164556962
5026496,5,B006X040NY,"Hyped sky-high, worldwide media blitzed, billboards commandeered: 007 glares out from every corner in the land.

It seems a lot of trouble to go to for just another Bond film; it even gives pause to wonder of this grand Dame of a franchise, in her fiftieth year: doth the lady protest too much? Is the party over for 007 and his backdated brand of boyish bravura?

This question is on Sam Mendes' mind too. And 007s, and M's. This time it isn't just James Bond who is the dinosaur. It's MI6 itself.

Previous Bond franchise reboots have been about modernising a diehard chauvinist throwback. That this was quixotic and self-defeating was demonstrated by the effete outputs: Goldeneye. Die Another Day.

Sam Mendes addresses that head-on: Daniel Craig is scarred; haggard; careworn. Old. He looks like he's had enough, even before being snipered off the roof of a goods wagon during a punch-up over a high Turkish gorge in the opening scene.

To underline the air of finality, as Bond's body hits the water and floats into a truly old school animated opening sequence, a truly old school Bond theme strikes up, and in the fashion of a truly old school Bond chanteuse, Adele sings, to almost exactly the tune of Diamonds are Forever ""This is the end"". Good gracious: they're not declaring the innings closed, are they?

It's a question that hangs over the two and a half hours of Skyfall.

MI6 has carelessly let its roster of embedded under-cover agents fall into terrorist hands, and now they're being systematically whacked in full view of the world wide web. In trying to retrieve the list 007 has been shot, seemingly dead: collateral damage of a risky shot by his own colleague, Eve (Naomie Harris). A risky shot taken at the direct order of M herself, in knowledge of Bond's jeopardy, we fear to protect herself as much as her department.

And now the net is drawing in on M herself. Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), a career bureaucrat, is put in charge of the department. He wants M out in a month. All done the proper way, by dignified retirement: a very British coup.

In her eyes she knows her days are numbered, but M is having none of it, not while there's still work to do. Dumbledore repairs to her study where her favourite boy wizard - the boy who lived - awaits. (Forgive me confusing my movie idioms: as the film progresses the similarities become ever more striking)

Time to get back to what we do best, James. Old school style. And always, confronting our right to be here: are we still relevant? Are we still understood? In the middle of this social revolution are we still fit for purpose? If we're to best make sure we're not redundant, how should we respond?

M's, and Mendes' answer: go back to basics; concentrate on what we know best. Old school.

Bond sits in contemplation at the national gallery in front of Turner's painting of the HMS Temeraire, a willowy veteran of the Battle of Trafalgar, being towed by a steampunk tug to be scuttled. He is interrupted by a precocious teenager (Ben Whishaw), who turns out to be the new Q. But this time gimmicks are muted: a palm-print personalised Walther PPK and a miniature radio tracker. Old school. Bond reverts to his old DB5. He's tempted to use the ejector seat on M when she's haranguing him: Old school.

Much has been made of Javier Bardem's villain, but this film isn't about the villain. Raoul Silva is no Anton Chigurh; Bardem plays him almost as comic relief. His villainy is barely needed: Skyfall deals in a far more claustrophobic perfidy than him.

Things proceed with a sense of scale and grandeur that James Bond has never in my experience attained, for two and a half hours. It feels like there's more at stake than is usually the case; it feels here that, however it ends, the Bond universe will have irreparably changed. And so it turns out. The ending is moving, profound and ingeniously it leaves the franchise ready to embark upon a next decade of adventures, with all the pieces in place.

Old school.

5026497,5,B006X040NY,"This is a movie for grown-ups. The screenplay and the direction had me mesmerised as a captive in the cinema. We were all so intimate with James Bond. The silences as dramatic as the chases over roof tops. These actors had to act.

The simile of the two rats meant we were in serious Bond territory here. From the old world in the shadows without grief, to the new age of touch-screen decisions. Without grief. This old man saw the flaws as did Daniel Craig's James Bond. The humor still shines. The world is within.

Skyfall is a top flight movie. Never mind allusions to others in the franchise, I noted respectful glances at The Usual Suspects, The Third Man, Citizen Kane and Gladiator before other Bond movies. See this movie in the cinema. I left as 007. Hands in pockets; ready for anything.

*****

19 February 2013. The dvd version of the movie has just been absorbed. Thunderous soundtrack of music, guns, bombs and crashes. Cinema sound at home blasts like no cinema I've ever visited! Subtitles I was looking forward to, especially what Bond says as he leaves a gambling house. Hope you note the Citizen Kane scene when the simile of the two rats is explained to Bond and ourselves. Very famous focus trick as one man approaches another who is close to the camera. Delicious Mendes.

Now the film is filed next to the other Danial Craig 007s. Do you mind if I fantasize about working on the screenplay for the new Bond film? People actually get paid for such a thrill.",1351555200,4,1480,4.548872180451128
5026498,5,B006X040NY,"Without giving too much away, the 23rd installment in the James Bond film series, ""Skyfall"" opens with a terrific, fast-paced action sequence in Istanbul employing 4 wheel drives, motorbikes, trains and a Cat digger.  A hard drive containing the names of agents embedded with terrorist cells has been stolen; agents have died, more will die and M (Judi Dench) is being scapegoated.  But not only is M's job at stake, but so is her life.  Bond's mission: retrieve the drive, save M, save England and the world.  His accomplices include a fresh faced new quartermaster whose arrival is explained by events in the first half hour of the movie (played by Ben Whishaw) (Layer Cake; Perfume), and a stunning and capable female agent (played by Naomie Harris) (28 Days Later, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), whose true identity is only revealed at the end.  Rory Kinnear, reprising his role as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner, the creepy villian, Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem)(No Country For Old Men; Biutiful), his employee and Bond's short-lived love interest Severine (the beautiful Berenice Marlohe) and M's politician boss Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) are all excellent players, but even Daniel Craig's moody Bond cannot detract from the real star - the iron lady of British intelligence.

Getting back on the horse after a near-death experience proves more difficult for 007 then he imagined.  Q may have presented him with a special new Walther PPK, but what good is that when Bond can no longer shoot straight?  He's out of shape, he's got shrapnel in his shoulder and, as M reminds him, in desperate need of a shave.  How can he hope to compete with Silva, a former agent who, well funded by selling his services to the highest bidders, has been plotting his cruel revenge against M and the agency since 1997?  Mallory asks Bond why he didn't just ""stay dead"", but he already knows the answer.  Silva will stop at nothing to kill M, and Bond is not just going to let that happen.

Bond follows the man whole stole the drive to Shanghai, where he first spots Severine by chance.  When they next meet in Macau, she is afraid - not of him, but of the sadistic Silva - who not only has penetrated MI6's secure firewall, but commands a wide range of inventive ways to wreak havoc.  Silva admonishes Bond and MI6 for being out of touch with the present.  But Bond proves that, even with the latest technology, you just can't beat some old fashioned tools of the trade - a knife, a sawed-off shotgun and an Aston Martin DB Mark III.  And as he admits to Silva in their first meeting, resurrection is Bond's forte.

Most of the story takes place in the UK - in London (including subterranean) and the mist-covered Scottish moors.  And there, in Scotland, is Bond's childhood home and the games keeper Kincade, played with quiet dignity by Albert Finney.  The grand, but derelict stately home - the secret it holds - and the defense Bond and Kincade mount against overwhelming odds - offers more evidence that sometimes older is better.

However, at the end, we get glimpses of the future - which will feature in the next installment of the series.",1351296000,4,3153,4.718978102189781
5026499,5,B006X040NY,"Coinciding with the 50th Anniversary when the very first James Bond film was released (October, 1962 with Dr. No) ""Skyfall"" is the 23rd installment of this extraordinary franchise and will feature the beautiful Daniel Craig in his 3rd outing as Bond.

 Made on a budget of $150,000,000 (compare that to Dr. No's budget of $1,000,000!) the movie will be about the disappearance of Bond and questions as to whether M (James' boss and female commander) is capable of doing her job as the head of the secret Service. A mad man, Raoul Silva, is determined to destroy both Bond and M and Bond is determined to destroy him on a trail from London to the South China Seas.

 British music superstar and composer Adele is doing the title song of ""Skyfall"" and rumors are circulating that she will win an Oscar come next year.

 Daniel Craig is also signed on to star in four more upcoming James Bond features.

 Upon being released ""Skyfall"" became the most financially successful James Bond film to open raking in $80,000,000 alone in North America and bringing in a worldwide gross of nearly $500,000,000!",1349654400,8,1097,4.767195767195767

5026518,4,B006X040NY,"This is one of Craig's best Bond films. This is the most human and realistic portrayal of 007 I've seen. He's getting older , has been dealing with alcoholism and substance abuse probably from all the medications he has taken for pain, and insomnia over the years. Bond isn't a super hero. He's just a man with determination and loyality to his country.
 I like how this movie shows his superiors second guessing his ability. This is very human. And what else is very realistic , is the looming inevitability of the so called ""Internet Of Things"" knocking at MI6's door, with politicians questioning the relevance of the agency in this ""new world"". Bond and companies detractors seem to suggest that computers are going to fix everything and that we just need to put all our trust in the current trend of high tech survialence systems and centralized governing bodies.

 It is not til the next film ""Spectre"" that we will see the powers that be's rebuttal to the argument Bond makes here for a ""man in the field"" However this is a fine precursor to those events and we are introduced to one of the all time best Bond villians , Mr. Silva.
 Silva knows the inner workings of MI6, being once the best and brightest serving under M. And he's back to settle a score, with both computer genius and a very likable personality. You really want to hear what Silva has to say in this film. He isn't just some crazy bad guy. He's one of the few that understands the position of being a 00 agent.

Skyfall gives us two agents determined to prove something to themselves. Bond especially is interesting to watch here as he goes through physical tests and evaluations.

One of things I really like about Bond in this movie is his dedication to staying focuses. His determination to complete the task he sets his mind too. Despite any votes of no confidence in his ability , Bond remains confident still.",1520035200,,1890,4.576923076923077

5026528,4,B006X040NY,"A pretty cool entry as Daniel Craig returns in his third outing as James Bond. Throughout the years, James Bond actors that managed to make it to a third film have grown seasoned and are at their most capable. Goldfinger had Connery, Spy Who Loved Me had Moore and World Is Not Enough had Brosnan. Skyfall becomes a worthy entry for Daniel Craig.

Bond deals with a man having stolen sensitive information, information his boss M badly wants back. An act of desperation on M's part leads to Bond being wounded and worse, the stolen information used against her and MI6. Bond returns to face this anonymous threat as he and M are on a path of great danger. Definitely one of the most realistic of James Bond stories, worthy of a Fleming novel. Though a bit to serious as very few jokes and one liners are told, some lovely women and a few gadgets.

5026579,4,B006X040NY,"A much better movie than the previous one has Daniel Craig as James Bond returning to active duty after being shot while on assignment. Somebody rather clever is after M who always seems to be two steps ahead of everybody. Javier Bardem plays a great villain with a rather interesting backstory and history and we get to see much of James Bond's background including his ancestral home in the Scottish Highlands.

An interesting twist would have been to have Sean Connery come back as the Gameskeeper and caretaker of the place but I doubt he would have been up for it.

In any case it's a good choice as the penultimate Daniel Craig James Bong movie. Not as good as Casino Royale however but definitely better than Quantum of Solace.",1498608000,,734,4.638461538461539

I'm not very familiar with the James Bond movies (I think the last one I watched was probably in the early 1980s at a drive-in theater).  About three years ago I watched Daniel Craig in Cowboys & Aliens and really liked him so when I saw this at Best Buy recently for $3.99 I figured what the heck.  The movie is over-the-top.  It's like Batman without the costume.  He's superhuman.  But it's great fun.  Really enjoyed the movie and the entire cast.

How he escapes from these situations is part of the fun of a Bond movie. As always James Bond has a way with the ladies and exhibits his cool persona. There are not a whole lot of fancy gadgetry, but enough to keep it interesting. The story line was good with a few surprises and twists heightening the suspense. We learn a bit more about Bond's past in this movie which is an interesting addition. But Daniel Craig as Bond does not exhibit much emotion or character in his role. The villain, Javier Bardem, was fun to watch in a sick way. Overall, this was a movie I do recommend for the avid Bond fan.",1496275200,,725,4.338235294117647

5026591,4,B006X040NY,"When I bought the DVD back in '13 and watched the movie for the first time, I was (unfairly) too hard on it. After recently watching it again, I think this is an important film, especially for the old Bond fans like myself, because we truly live in a different age. Our epoch has many conveniences and amenities, but it is also extremely frightening, due to the scourge of terrorism and slaughter of innocents. For this reason, ""Skyfall"" resonates more with me now, because it chronicles our fragile existence and is applicable to the age in which we live.

When M reads the Tennyson poem in the courtroom you get goosebumps, because you detect the truth in the words. Epic. Also, the shootout at the Skyfall Lodge reminds me of an old American Western. In the words of Bond: ""Some men are coming to kill us. We're going to kill them first.""

Is this movie formulaic at times, and hard to believe? Of course, it's a movie, and we watch movies to escape. But there are also some important themes in the film: loyalty, honor, perseverance, duty, integrity, courage. We need more of this in ""action movies.""",1494028800,4,1104,4.598984771573604

With ""Skyfall"", Bond returned, from the opening sequence to the title song to the film as a whole.  The heist of a list of embedded NATO agents threatens the entire 00 program as a rogue former agent (played with devious perfection by Javier Bardem) targets M at whatever cost.  If a Bond movie ever attempted an ensemble cast, it is here and it works out brilliantly.  Frankly, much of the tedium that comes with Bond films seems, in retrospect, to rest with the director and writer - it is an awful lot to ask an actor to carry an entire film.  Here, the burden is carried by many and the scenes move seamlessly from here to next.  The photography is superb, particularly that of Scotland in all its rugged beauty.  The writing and direction are swift - they don't linger.  And Adele's contribution just seems like the perfect cap to launch this film into the stratosphere.",1490054400,,1005,4.670454545454546

Javier Bardem is the only bright light in this violent bloody rehash, and his time on screen is probably about 5 minutes unfortunately.  As the bad guy he is delightfully evil and insane, and he steals every scene he is in.  His chemistry with Bond is also great.  And then he goes away and there is a reeeeallly long boring interlude with Bond and M escaping into the countryside and a particularly dumb bit where a bunch of minions shoot at them in a house.

My advice is to just watch the Javier Bardem scenes on youtube and spare yourself fast forwarding through all the interminable chases, fist fights and shoot em ups.",1486166400,,916,4.6645962732919255

5026653,4,B006X040NY,"Skyfall (2012) is a modern-day 007 film that stars Daniel Craig as James Bond, and grossed over a billion dollars at the box office.  While I praise the very inventive action sequences, as well as the plot, I can't get on board with it's extremely high tech presence and insistence on abundance of action, as if the box office receipts are dependent upon appeasing young audiences. Furthermore, I find Daniel Craig hard to get used to in the role of 007; he may be my least favorite Bond. He just doesn't have the image of a great James Bond portrayal. Finally, this film seems to go in spurts of heavy action followed by the absence of action, with virtually no in between. It was like watching Die Hard followed by Dead Poets Society. Now, I'm not here to knock this film as something lousy; it is still quite entertaining, though not on par with better offerings, such as Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and The Spy Who Loved Me. The special features are good, and offer several featurettes, including commentaries.

5026669,4,B006X040NY,"In a recent Ultimate Movie Review Twitter Poll, I asked you what your favorite James Bond movie starring Daniel Craig was and you chose Skyfall. For me this was a hard choice, because Daniel Craig seems as though he was born to play James Bond. All the films he's done have been fantastic, but I can see why Skyfall won. This film stands out for many reasons, most importantly it gives us a rare look into the childhood of James Bond and for the rarest of moments we see Bond scared and on the edge of possibly giving up, but you know how the story ends, he's James Bond. If you missed Skyfall, the film is like many other stories, where an old enemy reappears, but in this case, the enemy isn't looking for world domination, he's looking for revenge against his former employers, the British Government and in particular the Double 0 program. Bond films are often times so similar that we tend to rate them based on the villain and the song, well, the song doesn't get better than the gem produced by Adele, but what about Javier Bardem? He is an Academy Award winner and for good cause, this dude was one of the scarier Bond villains to come around in a long time. The others in the Craig Bond movies were some pretty bad guys, who had done some horrible things, but no one was what anyone would call truly scary, not like the villains used to be. Bardem had that special something though, that not only made him a bad guy, but that kind of bad guy that can make audiences cringe. The Bottom Line, Skyfall wasn't my pick, but it was a close second, as this was probably the most personal and emotional Bond film perhaps in the entire series. Daniel Craig is still very much at his best, Javier Bardem is a villain who will always rank in the top ten, and who better to sing a bond theme than Adele. Wheather or not you picked Skyfall, there is no question that it is one of those Bond films that won't ever be forgotten.",1480291200,,1922,4.326869806094183

5026753,5,B006X040NY,"For a long time whenever I felt like a Bond movie I'd watch North by Northwest instead, wishing that there could be a Bond film as great as that. Of course, NOTHING will ever be as great as that. Ever. But Daniel Craig looks damn good as Bond and he's got that TA-DOW sexy confidence, so of course I'd go out to the theater to see his Bond on screen. And the films were good, but I always felt they could have been even better, especially with the way he was as Bond.

Finally, Skyfall came along. The story made sense and it kept my attention, which I admit can be difficult. The stunts are spectacular, and Javier Bardem almost steals the show as the best brilliant, evil, funny, damaged, terrifying, tortured, and complex psychopath I can remember in Bond history. This is the only Bond movie I've wanted to see more than once, and I've enjoyed it three or four times now. It's very entertaining and doesn't have those flaws that have marred many other action films. You know...things that are so illogical that they take you out of the fantasy. We should all thank Daniel Craig for bringing Bond back, reviving him in such a beautiful way. Even though he hates it now he really did such an awesome job, especially here.

5026904,5,B006X040NY,Liked it a lot. One of the best recent Bond Films. Javier Bardem is a great villain. Again I like to see a darker take on the Bond series. I like to see a trend to how the novels portrayed Bond. He over comes the villains by perseverance and surviving not some gadget or one out of a million feat. Even the Adelle theme grew on me.

5026908,5,B006X040NY,"When it was announced that Daniel Craig was going to be the newest reincarnation of Ian Fleming's iconic spy James Bond I, frankly, couldn't imagine it. Being of a certain age, I grew up with Sean Connery as 007 and later spent more than a few happy hours watching Roger Moore retool the role as a smoother version of the super spy.
Craig, however, surprised me in a good way. As physically rugged as Connery, he brings a darker and more intense feel to the role and that is never more apparent than in ""Skyfall."" In it, the writers give us not only action - and plenty of it - but also a deeper understanding of Bond's often complicated relationship with ""M"" - played to perfection by Judi Dench - and the demons that haunt him. Javier Bardem, as the villainous ""Mr. Silva"" - provides a nice counterbalance to Bond: It is easy to imagine that 007 could well have gone to the dark side for the same reasons.
Great art?
Probably not.
Well worth the price of admission?
Oh yeah.",1455408000,3,976,4.397790055248619

5026911,5,B006X040NY,"This and Goldeneye are my two favorite James Bond movies ever made. Daniel Craig stars as Bond in this film described by Access Hollywood as ""Fun, sexy, smart, intense, and exciting...The best Bond movie in decades."" James Bond is the longest running film franchise in movie history for a good reason; it is just that good. In this film, a mission goes very bad and spies identities are exposed worldwide which forces the Agency to relocate. Bond's boss named M is now under close scrutiny and may lose her job as a result. The Agency, also called MI6, is untrustworthy now and M calls on the one man she can trust. You guessed it. Bond gets the phone call. Bond has a new friend in a female agent named Eve as they hunt down a man named Silva, a ruthless, cunning, and deadly opponent who gives Bond the covert war of his life! This is a spy warfare movie masterpiece that even Spectre can barely compete with. Easily Bond's toughest opponent as you will see watching this film. The film is rated PG-13 for violence, minor sensuality, and crude yet not obscene language. This is one time when Bond should have called Le Femme Nikita!",1455148800,,1134,4.536585365853658

5026913,5,B006X040NY,"Skyfall to me is an exceptional Bond film.  I think it is either the 2nd or 3rd best film in the entire series.  I would probably rate Goldfinger #1 and The Spy Who Loved Me #2.  But there is no question that this film stands on its own and is much more memorable than your average Bond movie.  Primarily because of Javier Bardem as the villain Silva.  It has been years since we have seen a villain this cunning and intelligent.  Silva almost steals the whole movie away from Daniel Craig.  In this film we see Bond as a mature agent he is less reckless as he was in Quantum of Solace and seems to have learned patience having to outthink his adversary.  The film seems like an homage to the past, with Mennypenny, Q and the old red door at MI6 making a return to the series.

The new Q character is interesting and does a great job as well.  The film kind of reminded me of Goldfinger as a stand alone entry away from the Spectre plot Casino and Quantum were building towards.  That can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.  I liked where Quantum was heading and was looking forward to seeing Bond fight future villains that he was taking pictures of during the opera scene of that film.  This movie shifts in a different direction.  Instead of Bond just saving the hot damsel in distress this time he is trying to save M his mentor.  We also get to learn more about Bond's past than in any of the other films in the entire series.  Also the plot and story is excellent about a computer hijacker threatening to expose all of the British agents undercover around the world.  It makes for a strong premise to drive the movie forward.

My favorite part of the film is the helicopter scene when Silva flies in.  It is so ballsy and over the top I love it.  The movie just works on so many levels.  I did think it was a little premature to cast Bond as over the hill after this only his 3rd film in this series.  Maybe if he would have been 5 or 6 films in that storyline would have held more weight.  I mean it seems like just yesterday that Daniel made his first kill as Bond in Casino and went active as a 00 agent.  But besides that side note the film was outstanding.  I would rate this film 5 stars, I wish they could all be this good.",1455062400,,2257,4.157043879907621

5027007,5,B006X040NY,"It's difficult to write a review about a movie that you love without giving away something (spoiler type of stuff) but I'm going to try.  First, Craig's Bond, in this film, is the one Bond character that I can say transcends the myth.  He is amazing in this movie and even though he never wants to play the role again, I think he will go down as the best Bond ever.  The character, which has been explored in a number of different ways, is complex, rich, torn and human in this film.  He's a broken man that's been gutted, betrayed and left to pick up the pieces on his own.  I even relate to his ""addictions"" which are woven into the film as an unspoken backstory instead of smiling and asking for a martini shaken not stirred.  You want to root for him and at the same time you want him to stay in the dark place he was because of his failure.  The only negative in the film is not giving Bardem enough screen time.  He's a genius psycho that is so imbalanced you don't know if he is doing everything he does just to die or because he wants to kill everyone.  I think he wants to die but take the world with him.  Great movie, by far one of my favorite movies period and a must have.",1452988800,11,1185,4.113043478260869

5027013,3,B006X040NY,"Yet another villain whose ""Joker-esque"" plan relies on things way outside of his control.

1. Silva WANTS to be caught, yet makes it impossible for him to be found.

2. Silva's plan depends on young ""Q"" being stupid enough to hook his virus-laden laptop to the MI-6 mainframe.

3. Silva plants an impossibly well-placed bomb which he detonates, quite impossibly, at the right moment to block Bond's pathway to him.

4. After all of this, his plan is get with his men, disguise themselves as cops, and shoot M in an open courtroom in full view of the public. They fail.

SIlva literally could have just skipped to step 4 if THAT was going to be his ultimate plan.

But -- expecting the worlds' longest plane crash to keep dragging on over a couple more films, Skyfall instead shakes off the dust and sets the franchise upright again, like it had been stuck in some kind of incorrigible dream. If only we could have just...maybe made a minor correction to things.

Bear it no mind. For our patience, we are handed a classic Bond story, some non-stop action, and some surprising perspectives that give the usual cliches at least a hard shove, and occasionally actually ring the audience's head. While Javier Bardem is no stranger to villiany, his motives leave us with subtle questions of right and wrong. Yet his actions are what stirs our tanned, well-rested hero back into service. Welcome back, Mr. Bond. You'll find your office over in the gray area now.",1449619200,,877,4.73202614379085
5027051,2,B006X040NY,"Just finished watching, along with Jeff H., ""Skyfall"" released by 20th Century Fox.
Daniel Craig reprises the role of James Bond in this 23rd movie to feature Ian Flemming's deadly and irrepressible British spy.  I'm going to get in a world to trouble I suspect; but Craig, who does his best to channel his inner Sean Connery, is just too angry of a Bond filled with inner turmoil.  Craig just doesn't bring Bond to life in the manner that Connery or Roger Moore did.  Yes, I know, Craig's portrayal of Bond is supposed to be that of a younger version trying to live up to his more posh and polished peers - only Skyfall - Spoiler Alert here - shows is that Bond is a titled peer himself - master of a manor he hates for reasons which aren't entirely made clear.
Apparent death and rebirth are the themes constantly woven throughout Skyfall.  In the pursuit to recover a data file of Western Alliance agents, Bond is accidentally shot and presumed killed by a fellow agent - new to the field. Bond returns from the dead only when a deadly attack on MI-6 headquarters rebirths his loyalty pains to Queen, Country, and M - who is the intended target of the attacks which causes a high body count.
The villain of the piece makes a pass at a tied up Bond, who responds by hinting hey, I've been tied up and raped before, go for it. Okay, not those words, but even the villain knows, Bond is joking  - or is he?  With the push in some quarters to make Bond played by various men of color, preferably gay, who knows?  And I can't help but wonder what Bond's safe word is?
Straying from the original source material is never a good idea.  Skyfall strays and Craig is just a passable James Bond who is unable to bring Bond to life like Connery and Moore did.
Miss Moneypenny also deserves better than the fate she's been given in this movie.
Passable Bond - recommended only for die hard Bond fans.

It follows the Bond formula so there isn't much wiggle room there but it was a more personal Bond.  We learned a little more of his background and gained some understanding of what lies beneath Bond's  intense exterior as played by Daniel Craig.  He is more humanized and more of a fleshed out character and not just Bond, James Bond.  Good action fun and a must for Bond fans.",1449187200,,691,4.104477611940299

5027136,5,B006X040NY,"Oooh Mr. Bond! You are the best! Absolutely love this one! Such well written characters and storyline that keeps getting better and better as the movie progresses. Saw it at the theater and couldn't wait for the DVD to get out and it doesn't happen often. The well written script had so many catchy lines that my sister and I couldn't stop repeating them over and over to each other ""Oooh Mr. Bond"" ""Mommy's been bad!"" ""What makes you think this is my first time?"" and so on.

Dashing Daniel Craig is the best Bond ever in all Bond movies and in Skyfall he's just terrific! He portrays a Bond that is so vulnerable and yet so strong! Javier Bardem is irresistible to watch with superb acting that you can't help to momentarily sympathize with him until he starts blasting things here and there and threatens Mr. Bond. Can't say we love Q but he helps Mr. Bond a lot so we forgive him. Love Judi Dench as M so tender at heart and yet so ruthless at work. Ralph Phiennes is great as usual. All together we can sense the emotion of all the characters in this one and can somewhat understand the reason why they act the way they do however unjustifiable.

Can't stop watching Skyfall again and again over time. It's a brilliant movie and we'll recommend it to all.",1448323200,12,1260,4.4034334763948495

5027162,2,B006X040NY,"I'm not sure how this movie has been so popular. This is the only Daniel Craig as Bond movie I have seen, and I have to say that he is more of an anti-Bond than ""the best Bond,"" as many are stating. He is not suave; he is not debonair. He is beautifully built, very masculine, but Bond was not all about brute strength. He was about charisma.  (Which is why Pierce Brosnan was so good, although so many people seem to think not--these people are not true Bond fans).  Craig is an ok actor, and for an action movie, he can hold his own. But as Bond, I think not.

And the writing that everyone raves about, well, I would have to disagree with that, as well. Lots of fighting, shooting, blowing things up, but the dialogue has a lot to be desired. And the fact that he doesn't even ""save the girl?"" That's what Bond does. He beats the bad guys and saves the girl. The fact that she trusted him and it got her shot in the head, well, it was just a big enough let down to ruin the entire movie, because in the real Bond days, it would never have happened that way.

And for those of you who say ""the best Bond ever,"" I have two words for you: Sean Connery.",1448064000,,1152,4.061674008810573

Fourth, Albert Finney makes a nice character appearance as a grey-bearded Scotsman. Beyond that, the movie is ho-hum and lackluster. Javier Bardem is wasted as the bad guy. His role as a psychopathic agent gone bad (didn't we already see this plotline in Golden Eye?) is written with no depth, and affords him little opportunity to showcase his histrionic talents. we progress from 1 chase sequence to another without a whole lot of finesse. James Bond doesn't have many of his usual signature gadgets, and even though there are a couple of women, there isn't really a ""Bond Girl.""  Even the inimitable Judi Dench (cast again as Bond's boss, M) spends the last part of the movie looking tired and defeated, as if she's unsure what she's doing there. There are exotic locales all right, but except for a brilliantly lighted sequence in a Shanghai skyscraper, there's no real sense of place anywhere other than London.",1446940800,,1062,4.80327868852459

5027267,5,B006X040NY,"Groundbreaking and Outstanding! I suppose this is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? That remains to be seen. With time, I see that this really is not a good Bond film. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that.

5027268,5,B006X040NY,"Groundbreaking and Outstanding! I suppose this is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? That remains to be seen. With time, I see that this really is not a good Bond film. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time.

The plot brings things very close to home as Bond and his MI6 cohorts are looking for people with a mysterious and very important computer disc. The movie starts out with the traditional Bond film intense chase scene, giving way to the Skyfall theme sung by pop star Adele and the expected dreamy, fluid scenes behind the credits. Then the plot slows down, too much in fact, to build the basic premise before the intensity picks up to a crescendo as past misdeeds come to the fore and scores are settled. Actions occurring within the movie set the stage for future changes. Co-starring the irrepressible Judi Dench, Javier Bardem who rises to the level of his Oscar-winning performance in ""No Country for Old Men"", Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient), Naomie Harris (Long Walk To Freedom) as occasional sidekick, B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Lim Marlohe as love interest, the renowned Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw, and Ola Rapace.

It works to a degree even though I have come to dislike dramas (mostly on television) that have gotten away from the genre they are (detective, medical, law) and instead deal too much in soap opera like subplots.

Craig is a good James Bond. Javier Bardem is great (till his death scene) but his character is written inconsistently. The train wreck scene is a wreck IMHO. Where are the bodies on the train and why is it so quiet afterwards. A wrecked train isn't going to be soundless afterwards. It is sad we won't see anymore of Judi Dench as M.

5027334,4,B006X040NY,"I couldn't find any other adjusted term, imported from a Grand Funk's song to qualify the 23th entry. What it really caught me from this movie was the acidic self comments all the way through.

Bond is about to trigger the device who was employed in Goldfinger (my desert island Bond's movie) with M. The bureaucracy regards he is not apt (due his age) to defy the challenges; he doesn't approve the test made on him; watch carefully the sequence in which he literally made a personal therapy to state: ""A brave new world""; M exposes a crucial speech when she affirms our enemies have no face and the terrorism may hide everywhere and finally the fact the enemy was an ex-agent who really criticizes the formalities in which he was made prisoner of the Chinese regime.

You won't see Bond in the Casinos; you won't see surrounded by beautiful women (just only one) you'll enter Bond's origins; i.e what Skyfall represents for him.

Ralph Fiennes is magisterial as the alter ego of Bond but seen from the other side of the street; cynical and mordacious. Bardem ignites the screen when he makes his appearance, a feature that will surprise you due he exposes the facts from the dark motivations which conveyed him to clean up the state of things; he doesn't want to rule the world (as the most of the Bond's villains)he tries to outline the term: ""political correctness"" ; so in vogue of these new times (The Brave new world, perhaps?) this anti-hero attitude will let you thinking about how wrong he can be.

Two minors details that blurred the script: first the reporting news announce six fatal victims; but I watched seven coffins when M returns to give her last farewell; second when Bond emerges from the frozen lake and appears before M he's totally dry (Do you buy it?). Perhaps someone think this series has been made for the youngsters generations, but is it so? 50 years in scene means five generations of movie buffs.",1442016000,,1928,4.661764705882353

The story centres on James Bond [Daniel Craig] investigating an attack on MI6; the attack is part of a plot by former MI6 operative Raoul Silva [Javier Bardem] to humiliate, discredit and kill M as revenge against her for betraying him. The film sees the return of two recurring characters to the series after an absence of two films: Q, played by Ben Whishaw, and Eve Moneypenny, played by Naomie Harris. Skyfall is the last film of the series for Dame Judi Dench, who played M, a role that she had played in the previous six films. The position is subsequently filled by Ralph Fiennes' character, Gareth Mallory.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: When it comes to James Bond, the old ways can be a mixed bag. The series always had a tendency to run campy when given the chance. People normally blamed it on Roger Moore, but the truth is that tongue-in-cheek Bond can be tracked back all the way to 'Goldfinger.' The level of seriousness has waxed and waned over the course of the series, but by the time of Pierce Brosnan's final outing, 'Die Another Day,' it was clear that Eon needed to take their property more seriously. Thankfully they did, and with Daniel Craig on board as 007, they pulled a complete 180 degrees. Gone were the gadgets, the ridiculous villains, and most of the jokes. And as great as 'Casino Royale' was, there was a sense of something missing, and the less we say about the muddled, at times disastrously undercooked 'Quantum of Solace' the better.

That something has finally been returned in 'SKYFALL, the latest and so far greatest of Daniel Craig's outings as the iconic secret agent. The film opens with Bond chasing after a hard drive that contains the names of covert agents around the world. Accidentally shot by his partner, Eve [Naomie Harris], Bond falls off a moving train and disappears, presumed dead. Meanwhile, M [Dame Judi Dench] is being forcibly retired as a result of her screw-up, but not before a mysterious opponent hacks her computer and blows up her office. Languishing in exile, James Bond hears of the attack and returns. Despite not being wholly ready for the mission in front of him, M sends him out to find the villain pulling the strings.

'SKYFALL' is about James Bond facing his legacy, both as a character and a franchise. Given that 'Casino Royale' was a reboot, it seems a bit early to be playing the over the hill card with James Bond, but it's nice to see the filmmakers acknowledging that Bond can't be young forever, hopefully sparing us the embarrassment of another aging Bond running around like he were 20 years younger. The plot contrivance also allows Bond to go through a crucible that acts as more of a rebirth than the last two films did. And Daniel Craig rises to the occasion, bringing a melancholy to the character that has never been seen before.

'SKYFALL' also pushes James Bond into the realm of the prestige film, scoring A-list director Sam Mendes, who directed 'American Beauty' and 'Road To Perdition,' where he first worked with Daniel Craig. To turn a by-the-numbers franchise into something a little more elevated. Oh, don't worry, this movie still hits all the essential James Bond marks, and Sam Mendes has a refined eye for action, but now the drama is as important as the big set pieces. Sam Mendes brings along his own collaborators, much to the film's benefit. Thomas Newman's score injects some fresh blood into the series' music, while still making appropriate use of the classic themes. Even more impressive is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which has justly been nominated for an Academy Award. Roger Deakins creates a fantastic interplay of light and shadow that gives James Bond a mystique that the grit and grain of the last two films lacked.

In fact, 'SKYFALL' takes many of its cues comes from another recent critical and commercial action/drama blockbuster: Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'. The basics of the plot are remarkably similar, as is the suddenly vulnerable hero seeing a dark reflection of himself in the film's villain. Javier Bardem lights up the screen as the evil Raoul Silva. He's got a touch of old-Bond outrageousness, with a sense of panache that's wholly new. He doesn't even appear on screen until halfway through the film, and when he does, it's an unforgettable entrance that sets the stage for everything that comes afterward. Raoul Bardem's turn here is even more impressive when you consider that he's already played a hypnotic psycho assassin in 'No Country For Old Men', and the two performances bear no similarities whatsoever.

The other piece of the puzzle comes from an unexpected source. Dame Judi Dench is the second longest running actor, after the inimitable Bernard Lee, to play M and taking over the role in the 1995 film 'Goldeneye.' In that film, she famously called James Bond a ""misogynist dinosaur."" Over the Pierce Brosnan years, she softened to him, and with Daniel Craig she took on a matronly role that is brilliantly explored in 'SKYFALL. Although this isn't the first time M's past actions have come back to haunt her, that particular plot point was first brought to bear in the tepid 'The World Is Not Enough,' 'SKYFALL' smartly re-appropriates the idea, making it central to not just the plot, but also to the character motivations. By making Bond question his reasons for becoming a secret agent, and the nature of his relationship with M and he is finally able to become the 007 we know and love.

Sam Mendes, along with writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan, understand that even though Craig represents the start of a new type of James Bond, he's also the inheritor of the entire Bond legacy. For the first time since 'Goldeneye,' James Bond feels British again. A large segment of the film takes place in London, and there's not just Bond's trademark wit, but also the stiff upper lip of Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory and the cocky smugness of Ben Whishaw as a young Q. There are clear nods to previous entries in the series: An out of nowhere Komodo dragon is intentionally reminiscent of Roger Moore leaping over crocodiles in 'Live and Let Die,' a joke about an exploding pen is a direct nod to Pierce Brosnan's tenure, and a certain four-wheeled vehicle makes an entrance that generated spontaneous applause from the audience every time I saw it in theatres. There's even a part that was written for Sean Connery, although sadly the original 007 does not appear here. Even the film's theme song, brilliantly sung by the acclaimed and accomplished British singer Adele recalls the torch songs Shirley Bassey made famous for the series. And of course, Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins are British themselves, although interestingly it took Jame Bond to get Sam Mendes to make a British film about British people, the rest of his films being about Americans.

'SKYFALL' skilfully manages to synthesise the old with the new, bringing Bond into the modern world even more successfully than its successors, although that isn't meant to be a slight on the still excellent Casino Royale. By acknowledging the past, Sam Mendes and company find the license to reinvent it. By the time we reach the film's closing credits, Bond as a character and a franchise is finally where we've wanted it to be since 2006: All the pieces in place to deliver classic James Bond adventures with all of the series trademarks intact, but not simply going through the motions. It's appropriate that the movie was released fifty years after the original release of 'Dr. No,' the first James Bond adventure that set the stage for all the rest to follow. We can only hope that 'SKYFALL' has infused enough creative blood back into the proceedings that we can see James Bond on top of his game for another fifty years.

Blu-ray Video Quality  I remember being surprised, pleased, and excited to hear that Sam Mendes would be directing the new James Bond picture, but my real excitement bloomed into complete and utter giddy fanboy glee is when I heard that Roger Deakins would be the film's cinematographer. Roger Deakins' is justly famous for his previous work with Sam Mendes, as well as his long-time collaboration with the Coen Brothers, among many other classic films like 'The Shawshank Redemption.' His work has a textural quality that brings images to life, and this quality is very much present in 'Skyfall.' Scenes such as the fight in Hong Kong set against a massive screen backdrop, or the film's climax in Scotland, lit by raging fires, are all trademark Roger Deakins. But even moments like the opening shot, showing an out of focus Bond in the background, slowly walking to foreground and focus, and lifting a gun, a shot that Sam Mendes refers to a reimagining of the classic gun barrel sequence, the traditional version of which can be seen at the film's end, reveal an eye for composition and detail that no James Bond film has ever had before. For a film with such a stunning visual palette, it was important to get the transfer right. Thankfully, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayers stunning encoded 1080p image and the aspect ratio 2.40:1 transfer is also stunning, maintaining all the subtlety and shading that Roger Deakins brought to the theatrical release. The aforementioned opening shot is perfectly reproduced and everything from the icy blues of London to the warm, slightly pushed colours of Macau come through cleanly. Flesh tones are accurate to the release prints, with a bit of an orange push at times. Contrast, an important element of Roger Deakins' technique, is well balanced, with deep blacks but strong whites. Sharpness and detail are exquisite. You can count the stubble on Daniel Craig's chin before Eve Moneypenny intimately shaves it all off. I was unable to detect any artefacts or other compression issues, leaving an image that is sharp, clear, and perfectly timed and balanced. Films like this justify 100% the existence of Blu-ray all on their own. It is worth noting that 'Skyfall' was released to IMAX theatres, both digitally and in, and for those releases, the film's framing was opened up from 2.40:1 to 1.85:1 to take advantage of the extra height that IMAX affords. In a proper IMAX auditorium, the taller ratio was quite effective, helping immerse the audience in the proceedings. However, it was never Sam Mendes' or Roger Deakins' preferred aspect ratio, and it rightly does not appear on this Blu-ray disc. To my eyes, the 2.40:1 composition is much tighter and highlights only exactly what you need to see, meaning that the lack of the 1.85:1 version on the disc shouldn't be seen as any kind of loss.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  James Bond films has always had a way with sound. Going all the way back to 'Dr. No' and the sound crew has been considered among the top of the industry. By now, big sound mixes are the norm for action films, but a good James Bond track still stands apart. A large part of this is due to the music. John Barry composed many classic themes that are as much a part of the series as any other element, take a look at 'Never Say Never Again' to see an example of a film that has many other James Bond trademarks, including Sean Connery as 007, but feels completely off because you never hear any of John Barry's familiar music. Long-time James Bond composer David Arnold did an admirable job of filling John Barry's shoes from 'Tomorrow Never Dies' through to 'Quantum of Solace,' but Sam Mendes smartly chose to bring in his own collaborator, Thomas Newman, to score this entry. Thomas Newman's score makes ample use of John Barry's work, but also goes in several new directions. At times he makes use of locale-specific instrumentation, and other times he uses a more traditional symphonic arrangement, but no matter how he presents it, his music is the most interesting and inventive that the series has had in decades. The disc's 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a great job of highlighting Thomas Newman's work. For an action film, the music is surprisingly prominent. Of course, the action isn't neglected either. Dynamic range is fantastic, handling everything from the warm strings, hearty and sometimes shrill brass of the music, and rumbling of the action with equal aplomb. Directionality and panning is seamless, with bullets ricocheting around the sound field and a thrilling deep track that comes to life and shakes your seats. Even more impressive is the sound field and sonic details in the film's softer scenes. The whisk of the cutthroat razor as Eve lovingly shaves James Bond has a satisfying glint, and the sounds of MI6 personnel working at their stations underneath London makes those scenes feel wonderfully alive. Even when it's just two characters talking, such as when M confronts Silva in a glass cage, the voices reverberate pleasingly, with Javier Bardem's snake oil voice standing in contrast to Dame Judi Dench's clipped, curt performance. 'SKYFALL' is a film that is just as fulfilling aurally as it is visually, and this mix is a fantastic reproduction of the theatrical experience and in my mind sounds even better via one Home Cinema Amplifier Reciever, at least you do not have to put up with people eating popcorn or slurping on the their massive drinks.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director Sam Mendes: Director Sam Mendes sits down and discusses the making of 'SKYFALL. Sam Mendes covers a lot of ground, from finding inspiration in the final three Ian Fleming novels to working with Roger Deakins, Newman, and Editor Stuart Baird. He talks about his aesthetic decisions, such as choosing to shoot with a smaller number of cameras than is normal for a James Bond film in order to make each shot more deliberate, and shooting the shaving scene with a Alfred Hitchcock maxim in mind: ""Shoot your murders like love scenes and your love scenes like murders."" He also tosses in a few fun bits of trivia, such as the fact that the exterior of M's London flat was actually John Barry's house. Sam Mendes does sometimes fall prey to describing what's happening on scene, but usually if he does this it's to explain a bit of pacing or scene construction. If you loved the film, then this engaging, smart, information-rich commentary is an essential listen.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner: Series producers Barbara Broccoli, who of course is the daughter of ""Cubby"" Broccoli, one of the franchise's original producers, and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner get together to watch the film, and sometimes talk. This is almost the exact opposite of Sam Mendes' commentary. The three spend a lot of time simply watching what's on screen, commenting on elements within the frame, and rarely saying much of relevance. Michael G. Wilson and ""Cubby"" Broccoli in particular feel as if they've attended a few too many press junkets where they've have to blandly endorse their latest movie, regardless of whether it was actually good or not. A few good comments manage to make it through, but if this commentary were left off the disc, no one would have mourned its absence.

Special Feature: Shooting Bond [2013] [1080p] [59:00] Actually a series of shorter documentary that can be played as an hour-long making of documentary, Shooting Bond is a solid cursory overview of what it takes to make a James Bond film. Interviews with the major cast and crew give a lot of insight into the process, and behind the scenes footage is mixed in, but mainly played under the interview dialogue. There are too many clips from the film for my taste, given that I can watch the film anytime I like, and each individual segment is really too short to truly go in-depth, but there are a lot of great moments to see, like Naomie Harris going through gun training was a personal favourite for me.

Special Feature: SKYFALL Premiere [2013] [1080p] [4:28] Scenes from the world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall, featuring interviews with Sam Mendes, Daniel Craig, Naomie Harris, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw.

Theatrical Trailer [2012] [1080p] [2:31] A smartly constructed action theatrical trailer that highlights great moments without giving too much away.

Special Feature: Soundtrack Promotional Spot [2013] [1080p] [1:00] A short brief introduction by composer Thomas Newman conducting the orchestra playing his score to advertise the Compact Disc soundtrack.

Promotional Trailers [2013] [16:00] BOND 50th Anniversary Blu-ray Special, A Good Day To Die Hard and Taken 2.

Finally, 'SKYFALL' completes Daniel Craig's transition from rough and tumble James Bond to a more classic, suave, sophisticated figure. Director Sam Mendes and his collaborators bring a level of prestige and artistic legitimacy to the film that the franchise has never had before, but never at the expense of what makes James Bond great. The series once again feels British, wholly revitalised, and surprisingly touching. It's a fantastic springboard for a whole new series of Bond adventures in the coming years. This Blu-ray has reference level audio video quality, with a transfer that perfectly reproduces Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematographic compositions and an audio mix that ably highlights Thomas Newman's exciting score. The special features are a bit of a mixed bag, with Sam Mendes' commentary being a definite highlight. The hour-long Shooting Bond feature is just good enough that you'll wish it was double the length. The rest of the features are fairly slight, but what we get is absolutely good enough to recommend wholeheartedly and a must own for all James Bond fans, like me. What I also love is the beautiful designed Limited Edition SteelBook inside and out, which was exclusive to Amazon in the UK at the time of the Blu-ray Release and of course has now gone pride of place in my all-inclusive James Bond Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

He's needed because the powers that be see no need for the violent 00 types ... until their butts are in a sling. Bond grabs M and flees to the totally isolated Skyfall, Bond's ancestral home in Scotland, where he, M, and the crusty caretaker face the bad guy and his crew. Pyrotechnics ensue ... lots and lots and lots and lots of pyrotechnics. Bottom line is it was an okay Bond flick it just didn't really hold together, story-wise.",1439596800,,684,4.310077519379845

The Daniel Craig version loved or hated brings a human factor. He has feelings , gets depressed, he doesn't hit every shot and doesn't always get the girl. I look at this with the same glasses as the new batman series. Batman of old is comical and fun where as the present day batman is dark , scary and real. It may not be the Bond of old but I find this version more enjoyable. I actually watched this first then went back to watch casino royale and Quantum of Solace.",1438732800,,595,4.0508474576271185

5027412,5,B006X040NY,"An intrepid Commander Bond has more than met his match in an invincible, vexatious nemesis, an Andri the Giant juggernaut incarnate from the earlier franchise movie ""Goldfinger."" James Bond the virile and priapic emissary that had the requisite propensity of effrontery and sangfroid to face down this truculent and rabid 800-pound gorilla (Javier Bardem). A stately M (Judi Dench) was summoned before the headmaster's study in London, because she lost the computer drive that had the identity of almost every NATO agent involved in terrorist organizations around the globe. M was asked to resign, but she ardently refused; she insisted on recovering the computer drive before it was decrypted and the secret agents' true identities are exposed. Shanghai and Macau, China (Las Vegas of the East), tantalizing vistas for 007 of these vertical, high-rise megalopolis' aerial landscapes, architectural structures, and voluptuous, audacious female companions (quite fond of the one with the ba-donka-donk)! The 2006 movie ""Casino Royale"" was good, but ""Skyfall"" is better and very entertaining, deserving five stars and more. The next installment ""Spectre"" will be released November 6.

5027455,4,B006X040NY,"Whats it about?

James Bonds (Daniel Craig) loyalty to M (Judi Dench) is tested when a blast from her past bites her on the butt. Then, when MI6 is attacked by a cyber-terrorist, things get all meta and Bonds old-school secret service hand-to-hand combat is pitted against a high-tech, gadget-savvy villain (Javier Bardem).

What did I think?

Bond and his frost-faced boss, M, are facing their most formidable threat, and no, its not Bardems unambiguously camp supervillain. No, its the risk of obsolescence  onscreen as well as off. Yet, with the pall of death bookending the 23rd film in the franchise  from the haunting Adele-crooned title sequence and opening plot gambit to the most un-Bondlike maudlin final reel  theres life yet in the spy and his series, both proving craggily endurable.

By Skyfalls climax, Craigs 007 seems more dutiful son than lethal gallivanter this time, but plentiful winks to trademark tropes (my word, is that an exploding pen in your pocket?) will reassure viewers the Bond mix is only being stirred, not shaken.",1431993600,,1048,5.023121387283237

The movie has plenty of Bond Action in it and Craig lends plenty of ""Manly"" auroa to his acting. It's great that Judy Dench plays #1 still. Definitely entertaining but, not quite like those early Bond films from the 60s.",1430611200,,341,4.516129032258065
5027524,5,B006X040NY,"My second favorite Bond movie, only beaten out (barely) by Casino Royale.  Excellent story, action, scenery (especially Scotland), and humor.  The new characters:  Moneypenny, Q, and Mallory were perfectly cast.  And Albert Finney's Kincade is wonderful.  Javier Bardem's Silva is a little over-the-top, but you can't argue with Bardem's acting ability.
My only real quibble applies to all the Bond movies -- the choice of handgun.  A .380 caliber Walther (or as Q calls it -- the ""9 millimeter short"") is easily concealable, but is only accurate to a few yards, and has inferior stopping power.  As far as I know and have read (and I'm not an expert) agents of most countries (especially in the U.S.) carry 9mm or 40 S&W, plus a few .45ACP and 10mm.",1430611200,,750,4.8125

5027546,5,B006X040NY,"007's installment --- part inspiring, part scrapbook --- reflects on the sudden demise, return from death, and epiphany of 007. In the early goings of a mission gone from bad to worse, 007 gets hit by friendly fire. He was probably dead, hit by a clean shot gone bad, but when he resurfaces later he is only a glimpse of the man he used to be.

  One minute 007 is unbeatable, the next he struggles to fire a shot, self-doubt creeping in. Strength is the flip side of weakness. The two are bonded together by time, which reveals what audiences might like to feel and experience for 007. In this new installment, ""Skyfall,"" 007 -- expected pillar of strength is vulnerable and weakened. One might disagree, of course, that the plot is just another revelation of 007's self-disclosure of his aging nature and past life. To pity 007 is to be consumed by past episodes, and along this journey ""Skyfall"" portrays a humanistic, if not warm, life-changing side of James Bond.

  Better, we look on, an action movie than none at all. We live in a movie world so preoccupied with action, so expectantly demanding, that we forget that predictable outcomes end at movie credit times. ""Skyfall"" becomes a human undertaking, a changing of the guard, a somewhat slow, sticky process of having to accept unintended results to reshape the future.

  In ""Skyfall,"" 007 and the whole of MI 6 changes for the good, reminding audiences of the deeper meaning of change, bonding the past with the future.",1430438400,,1482,4.713178294573644

Skyfall is a follow-up to a couple of prior 007 but this time they killed off their head woman executive that James Bond had to report to.  Changed the weapons guy that says all those things that turn into some tool for James to save his life with... well they DON'T DO THAT ANY MORE!  Gave him a gun and a phone with no tricky features except it was palm printed for James so if he lost his gun it couldn't be fired by the bad guy.

But, rather than rely on clever villains and good writing, instead, the writers and producers rely on having seasoned professionals make stupid mistakes to move the story forward.  Example... would an expert computer technician, when faced with an opponent they already knows is a skilled hacker, plug the villain's computer into their mainframe?  No.  They would use a separated system.  The whole villain's plan relied on such a mistake, and no expert would ever make that mistake.

1) Dr. No
2) Casino Royale
3) Skyfall

5027701,4,B006X040NY,"I am a life long James Bond fan though I haven't always loved all of the actors who have played him.  It seems that with the increase in computer graphics action movies have moved more and more toward high tech action sequences and away from good story plots.  I have been so bored with movies that basically nothing more than one action sequence after another with little story to tie the movie together.  It should be possible to have a balance.  This Bond movie was the first in a LONG while that was low on tech yet still HIGH on action, plus it had a good story plot.  And some of you might have always known what ""Q"" stood for, but naive me I didn't so this movie explained that little mystery for me.  I'll admit I still don't know if ""M"" is supposed to stand for something or not as they didn't give us that one, but maybe one tidbit should be enough for me.

This is coming from someone who probably enjoys stories more than action and is not a hard-core Bond fan, but enjoy the movies. (I believe in full disclosure.)

Overall, there are some plot elements that need correction and a few flaws in the editing that make this a less than perfect 007 film.

5027724,5,B006X040NY,"This is, in my opinion, the best of the 007 movies. The action was non-stop and thrilling. Anyone who loves the Bond movies will find this one to be above average because, even the old school British Secret Service is evolving; going super high tech. They even have a new Q. In the older movies, Q was a brilliant designer of ingenious gadgets, spy cars, and lethal devices, but now, this new and younger Q is all about beating Britons villains through the power of the computer. The young Q tells Bond at one point, ""we don't do exploding pens anymore."" That quote pretty much sets the tone for the whole movie. An ex agent wreaks havoc upon Her Majesty's agents and the once thought impregnable MI6 headquarters. James is presumed dead. But in truth, he has disappeared and laying low in some run down third world town. James is wallowing in a lake of despair and booze, hiding and living anonymously, bitterly happy to let the world and the secret service think him dead. He feels betrayed. But Queen and country, and M (who is on the verge of being ' put out to pasture"") needs him. Unfortunately, they think James is long dead. He could stay dead. He could let all of Europe go to Hell. Imagine how shocked they are when he reports for duty. He's out of shape. His age is catching up with him. He's been wounded so many times he can barely shoot straight. The younger agents think he's a dinosaur....boy, are they in for a surprise. Age means nothing when you have the experience 007 has!",1428796800,,1493,4.472527472527473

There is so much going on in this movie that it is quite spectacular.  You have several new locales that James visits to include some familiar ground.  The introduction of a new Q is a nice touch and overall the cast works well together.  I feel that the villian was a bit different from previous bond movies, but I enjoyed Javier's character.

This movie is an ode to the Bonds of past, while setting more groundwork for the future.  This has been a great redemption over the mediocre Quantum of Solace.  A return to form and just such a great movie.",1428364800,,730,4.355555555555555

He lacks the smooth, debonaire portrayal of the others (not all were my favorite as Bond but they captivated me).  Craig comes across to me as little thug in style.  I have looked at his movies more than once and still can't get captivated by them.  There is a Bond marathon on in March on Encore and I'm as happy as a lark seeing the other movies over and over again.  Skyfall left me ""blank"".",1427587200,,524,4.038834951456311

I don't want to post any spoilers, but the whole movie was saved in the last couple of minutes.  I thought that both Ralph Fiennes character and the female agent that Bond had been working with were both bad guys.  Then they introduced themselves by their actual names (ones which will be familiar to loyal Bond fans) and the whole experience changed.

5028379,5,B006X040NY,"Happy 50th anniversary, Mr. Bond. The Bond character goes from the smooth superspy who sleeps with beautiful women, drives fast cars, travels to exotic locales, and generally kicks butt to something altogether different. Now we see the Bond character evolve into someone who gets shot by his own people, sent back into action after he fails his physical, and really shows bags under his eyes and some age lines. He is having difficulties shooting stright, too. It is obvious that Bond can't trust M. Then enter an MI6 agent from the past who was sold out by M, and Bond finds himself facing his toughest adversary, a true supervillain. There are quite a few times in the movie where I thought it sucked to be him. Hmmm. Not quite the Bond I remembered as a kid that I wanted to be like. This movie, however, is full of adrenylene-pumping action, and has a surprise ending, which for a change involved a low-tech weapon.",1425513600,,919,4.644171779141105

But, I also love the way ""Skyfall"" is filmed  --  the lighting and other technical aspects of filming are the best ever for Bond films.
Finally, I really like the absence of the really silly ""gadgets"" and outrageous stunts of the earlier bond films.  S

5028718,5,B006X040NY,"love James Bond movies!  Like Daniel Craig in this role, not as corny as past James Bonds, ex: Roger Moore.",1420761600,,107,4.35
5028719,4,B006X040NY,"Seven actors have portrayed James Bond, Agent 007 of MI-6, the ultra- secret bureau branch of British Intelligent. None, in my humble opinion, will ever outdo Sean Connery as the cool and calculating international spy who sports automatic hand-guns and beautiful mistresses. However, I believe a close second may be the latest installments featuring Daniel Craig. While the forgettable mid-Bond films, starring Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, who seemed like he was just replaying Remington-Steele with higher budgets, more often than not were more like Bond-by-the-numbers intent on making money from the name, the women, and the gadgets, Daniel Craig has stood out. Craig may well be the best successor to Connery in the role.

The other Bond installments with the above-list of mediocre actors in cookie-cutter installments, featuring the obligatory femme-fatale, a casino scene, and a chase through the Alps, pale in comparison to the latest Bond installments with Craig. Maybe why I like the Craig versions as some of the best since Connery has to do with making Bond more vulnerable. In many of the Moore and Brosnan installments, I certainly knew Bond would break free from his plot-driven shackles but the way the character was played, I thought the character himself knew he would win in the end, and so I was never rooting for him. He was always so cool that I knew he knew he would prevail. Not with Craig. Craig's take on Bond is more subtle with sudden unexpected emotions, as if his character doesn't know whether it will turn out in his favor, which is as it should be. Craig sweats, grunts, even sheds tears. I never saw Moore grunt hardly at all. (I liked ""Jaws"" from ""Moonraker"" much more than Moore.)

In ""Skyfall"", Bond and MI-6 are dealing with a foe who has infiltrated the computer systems of British Intelligence. Part of this foe's breach includes the revealing the aliases of under-cover British agents all over the world. Bond and MI-6 must stop this baddie before he or she compromises more field agents which may lead to their deaths. Is this is an old foe, like Specter, a new foe, or someone else? Maybe someone who knows the intricacies of British Intelligence? A wonderful film from start to finish with a good combination of humour, action and even emotion. And there's even a throw-back to elements of the old Bond films of the 1960's.",1420761600,13,2387,4.905940594059406
5028720,1,B006X040NY,"If you love Casino Royale's new realistic take on James Bond.... then you'll absolutely hate this trash.

I have never been a Bond fan. When everyone began to really buy into the hype for the Casino Royale hype, I just rolled my eyes and told them to expect another silly, over-the-top, dumb action flick like the Pierce Brosnan films. I had no intention of wasting any money on it whatsoever and I waited until the DVD came to my local library. I was astonished by the film. Not only was it not ridiculous, it's themes and messages were poignant and thoughtful. It didn't make grand messages about good guys stopping bad guys; it determinedly defined people who hurt other people as bad guys and then left the audience to ask ""aren't some bad guys necessary to stop other bad guys"". Though it was no simple morality play, it developed a wonderful level of intrigue by leaving the audience with the same information as the protagonist. James Bond constantly struggles with the prospect that none of his actions may be legitimate, and is constantly hampered by lack of knowledge of the bigger picture, bigger threats, and bigger political arena that his seniors refuse to inform him of.

And then Quantum of Solace was all that and more! I do not understand the dislike of this movie. For whatever reason this film was hated by both critics and fans, and that fact bewilders me. Bent on revenge, James Bond goes rogue to find out about that bigger picture he's been left out of. Unlike his country and his bosses. he is willing to damage political relationships all for what he believes is the right thing to do. In doing so character and the intrigue are brought to new depths, the likes of which we haven't seen since movies like The Hunt for the Red October and The Usual Suspects. This film is the crowning achievement of everything that James Bond ever was to everything it could become. This is the jewel of the franchise.

And then this happened. Most likely, it was the confluence of QoS not doing as well as expected, and the 50th anniversary of James Bond coming together that made them do what they did. It doesn't matter, they ruined all their good grace with this waste of film. James Bond is given no depth in this film, the intrigue just about completely disappears, and the typical James Bond villain is back. This movie plays like a film adaptation of a property decades old that is trying to reach a new audience (ala Charlie's Angels, Dukes of Hazzard, or Starsky and Hutch). It overplays this old vs. new trope to such an annoying degree that it is essentially taunting you with it. The plot is a joke, which is that much more embarrassing since they stole it from several better films (Avengers, Speed, Goldeneye). And yeah, James Bond exploits a sex slave for icing on the cake, and we're supposed to believe that it was mutual. Thank you for displaying absolutely no sensitivity for trafficked people on top of no film-making ability Skyfall.

And I am back to being a nonfan of James Bond. Even if they do get Idris Elba to do the next one, I probably won't go see because of Skyfall.",1420675200,,3107,4.5927927927927925

5028910,3,B006X040NY,The movie is way to long and slow paced. Plus this is an terrible actor to play James Bond.,1420156800,,91,3.8421052631578947

5028914,4,B006X040NY,"My wife missed the old ""Q"".  When Bond said, ""It isn't quite Christmas, is it?"", we could only agree.  Ah, but the old ""Q's"" ghost puts in an appearance about 2/3's of the way through the movie.

This was a very different Bond movie.  Very early in the movie, the question is raised:  Should ""M"" retire?  Is Bond ready for field work?  At times, my family said things like, ""Don't leave the gun!"" and ""Did he just leave his gun behind?""  This proves that, if my family were super spies, we wouldn't make mistakes like that!

All that said, this is a solid entry in the James Bond franchise, filled with action and (of course) a few scenes worth fast forwarding if you don't appreciate being sexually titillated.  But then, that's James Bond.  Either don't purchase the movie if you don't like these scenes, or (as we do) keep the fast forward button handy.

I suppose the answer is, they aren't quite past their prime.  Not yet.",1420156800,,928,4.485029940119761

5028930,3,B006X040NY,"This is a totally over-the-top action film, in the same vein as the Bourne movies, and like the Bourne movies, it's quite well done, within the parameters of the genre.  Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery, and Judi Dench adds a touch of class to the proceedings. Still, it must be noted that this type of film, however well done, is fundamentally lame, insane, and may not be good for your mental health.",1420070400,,418,4.5

  james bond movies never disappoint.  this daniel craig version was excellent, but sad...no spoiler alerts here...as usual, james bond does his thing, but someone else steals the movie with his portrayal of the evil guy.  if you have seen any of the villain movies, you will just say...he follows all of his recent bad guy characters.  root for the home team as usual and you will be satisfied.  great movie and it fit right into the cold weather spell in the usa...our only complaint is:  where are all of the other daniel craig james bond movies on amazon prime, netflix or roku?",1419984000,,589,4.660194174757281

5028964,5,B006X040NY,"My favorite Bond, by far. Daniel Craig adds a physicality that was missing from the last couple Bonds and Mendes has done a nice job of making the stories if not plausible, at least more serviceable than Golden Eye, etc. And, it doesn't hurt that ringers like Dench, Harris, and now Fiennes are giving weight to supporting positions. It allows for underlying themes to get more development over the course of several films, as opposed to being stuck in one-shot spectacles. And, I get it, out with the old, in with the new... and the inevitable inversion of that old trope... old things becoming new again... but did they really have to shoot up the Aston?",1419897600,,656,4.663793103448276

The story is brisk and interesting, the acting from Craig and Madame Dench is superb, and the cinematography is splendid.  I wasn't as wowed as everyone else about Bardem's performance and found it inferior to Sean Bean's similar role in Goldeneye, but your mileage may vary.

He's still swirling martinis, he's still got the girls and the car, but it's much more grounded and straight forward. You have a classic villain, and even though the action does peak early, it's still a thouroghly entertaining watch from start to finish. The one gripe I have if anything is there's a dumb hacking subplot that takes a bit away from the realism but I suppose it's fitting in today's world.

 I definately liked seeing Bond at a more personal and grounded level. Daniel Craig is three solid movies in at this point and it's nice to see him going through a bit more of a struggle in this one. Quantum of Solace was by no means a terrible movie, and Casino is great, but Skyfall takes the cake as the best Bond film in a long time.",1419638400,,913,4.333333333333333

5029046,2,B006X040NY,"I expect Bond films to be many things, but boring isn't one of them.  I honestly do not understand all the love for ""Skyfall"".  It is a rather pedestrian Bond film and not very engaging or entertaining.  Are we so starved for entertainment that we have lowered our expectations?

One of the most important ingredients in a Bond film is an interesting villain with a fiendish plan.  We don't get that with ""Skyfall"", and so it is hard to get invested in the storyline.  It's just not a fun film.

The better Bond films benefit from their expansiveness:  the scope of the villain's plot isn't revealed in its entirety until near the end.  We get a build-up to the payoff.  In ""Skyfall"" we get no such payoff because we learn fairly early on what the antagonist's goal is, and the for the rest of the film we just wait for the hero to (inevitably) make things right again.  The fact that one of the good guys dies in the end seems trivial because it isn't in defense of anything important.

This movie was one of the most financially successful films in the Bond franchise, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's any good.  The Bond franchise is over 50 years old and the novelty has worn off a bit.  Times have changed, public tastes have changed, and movie-making styles and priorities have changed.  This entry in the series feels more like a Jason Bourne film than a Bond film, meaning it is stylish-looking but rather soulless, generic, and takes itself a bit too seriously.

Because the Bond franchise is a revenue machine you can bet they'll keep churning them out on a regular basis, whether there is an interesting story to tell or not.",1419638400,,1642,4.552901023890785

How they are letting this vanilla-boring guy stay in the Bond role for 4 films is beyond me.

The entire ""Skyfall"" mansion sequence (does it go longer than an hour?  Seemed like it) is some kind of survival drama, not a Bond film.  (Seemed like a ""trapped-in-a-dark-cave-with-a-serial-killer"" movie.)
Some reviewers have said the first hour of this movie is uninteresting setup.  The last hour was dark and unenjoyable.  I forget if there might have been 10 minutes of something good in between, but I doubt it.

If you are a Bond fan, for me it was loaded with callbacks to the old bond films (Q Branch, surprising car bring back) with a truly intriguing, powerful and brilliant villain. For me, I couldn't help but admire his cunning and cleverness...and so committed.

Daniel Craig - A+ Bond.  Have you seen Layer Cake?  look it up.

Javier Bardem as the bad guy...superb.  He racks up another intriguing and dense character ( He was in ""No Old Country for Old Men"" and ""Vicki/Cristina Barcelona"" and others)

You find out about Bond's background...where he really came from.  And how M5 recruits disturbed and displaced boys as ideal for the professiona.

Action: Gripping.
Beautiful Women: Check
Exotic Locations: All in service to the story.
Blow Em Ups...One of the best final scenes in a movie ever
Unexpected Twists and Turns: Count on em.

5029188,5,B006X040NY,"In this 50th year of the James Bond series, with the dismal ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) still in our minds, ""Skyfall"" triumphantly reinvents 007 in one of the best Bonds ever. This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he earlier played well in ""Casino Royale,"" not so well in ""Quantum"" -- although it may not have been entirely his fault. Or is it just that he's growing on me? I don't know what I expected. I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating.

The movie's innovations begin in its first shots, which abandon the familiar stalking silhouettes in the iris lens, and hit the ground running. Bond and another agent are in Istanbul, chasing a man who has stolen a crucial hard drive, and after a chase through city streets (involving no less than three Fruit Cart Scenes), 007 is running on top of a train. We know from earlier films that Bond can operate almost anything, but ""Skyfall"" incredibly has him commandeer of a giant Caterpillar and continue the chase by crushing a flatcar filled with VW Beetles.

It's the kind of absurd stunt we expect in a Bond movie, but this one relies on something unexpected: a dead-serious M (Judi Dench), following the action from MI6 in London and making a fateful decision. After an enemy agent grabs Bond as a human shield, M's other agent, Eve (Naomie Harris), has both men in her gun sights. The stakes are very high. ""Take the shot!"" M commands. Bond seems to die, although since this happens around the 20-minute mark, we're not very surprised that he doesn't.

M begins to compose the obituary of Commander James Bond, and she might as well also be writing her own. Time has passed her by, she's older, and her new boss, Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), convenes a public (!) hearing requiring her to defend her tenure. It's time for a generation to be put out to pasture. Even Q and, as it turns out, Miss Moneypenny are practically kids.

M is not quite ready to retire, and ""Skyfall"" at last provides a role worthy of Judi Dench, one of the best actors of her generation. She is all but the co-star of the film, with a lot of screen time, poignant dialogue, and a character who is far more complex and sympathetic than we expect in this series. The film is guided by a considerable director (Sam Mendes), written by the heavyweights Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan, and delivers not only a terrific Bond but a terrific movie, period. If you haven't seen a 007 for years, this is the time to jump back in.

There's a theory that you can grade the Bonds on the quality of their villains. In ""Skyfall,"" this is a cerebral megalomaniac named Silva, played by Javier Bardem, whose unpronounceable Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"" approached the high-water mark of Hannibal Lecter. Here he plays a bleached blond computer whiz who stole the drive containing the guarded identities of every MI6 agent. Are we supposed to think of Julian Assange?

This is a brand-new Bond with love and respect for the old Bond. This is dramatized during Bond's visit to the weathered Scottish mansion inhabited by Kincade (Albert Finney), which has secrets to divulge and continues the movie's rewriting of the character's back story. During the early Bonds, did we ever even ask ourselves about 007's origins in life? ""Skyfall"" even produces a moment designed to inspire love in Bond fans: a reappearance of the Aston Martin DB5 from ""Goldfinger,"" which remains in good operating condition.

Just as Christopher Nolan gave rebirth to the Batman movies in ""The Dark Knight,"" here is James Bond lifted up, dusted off, set back on his feet and ready for another 50 years. And am I completely misguided when I expect to see Miss Moneypenny become a Bond girl in the next film?",1418428800,,3856,4.678466076696165

For the experienced Bond fans (or at least those who keep up with the series), the  satire at spy films (including classic Bond films) pushes up to 5 stars for me.

If this is your first Bond movie, it might not meet 5 star performance for you. May be more like a 3.5.

Ben Whishaw's Q was a refreshing of the character that does not tarnish Desmond Llewelyn's legendary performances as Q, and Judi Dench's M is note-perfect, as one would expect from a lady who's earned Dame.

5029310,1,B006X040NY,"Right now, or very soon, dear readers, many of you will hate me. I use the expression ""dear readers"" not to denigrate in any way those who read this. It is merely a salute to ""Mad magazine"" which, speaking only for myself, is where much of this tripe belongs. As I was thoroughly unimpressed, please forgive me if I get its cornucopia of blunders listed in no particular order. Nor will I take the short story length it would take to list them all. So, please, bear with me. Briefly touching on Daniel Craig, much as the film chooses to do, despite the naysayers of early 2006, he is without question the BEST Bond since Connery. Which makes it even sadder that he is reduced in this mess to such a minor player, his billing should read ""special guest cameo by Daniel Craig as James Bond"". What is the point of him firing a gun on the poster? It should have been Judi Dench, since it is so clearly her film. She has obviously demanded a larger and larger role with each new film, and, as her swan song (thankfully) she really gets what she wants. Apparently, this is due to her title, not her abilities, since, as ""M"" her acting seems limited to never changing tone and only changing facial expressions long enough to harden her cheekbones. Ah, the ""Jack Lord School of Acting"". Adele's theme? Much ado about nothing. ""You Know My Name"" was a far superior song, yet went without praise. Javier Bardem, always overrated in my humble opinion, has never proven me more right then now. His blonde, Donald Trump hair aside, he seems determined to be the poor man's knockoff of Heath Ledger's ""Joker"", falling woefully short of even Nicholson's. At one point, when not giggling inappropriately, he kills Berenice Marlohe in front of Bond who is unable to stop him due to the armed guards surrounding him. The very same armed guards 007 takes out just seconds after she's dead. Earlier, she asks Bond if he knows what fear is. His only logical comeback is ""Yes, another hour and some odd minutes of this drivel"". Ben Whishaw, the new ""Q"" is intentionally a Harry
Potter/ Peter Parker knockoff, but without any likeability at all. And, suddenly, how old IS Bond. We saw him become a double-0 for
the 1st time in 2006's dynamic ""Casino Royale"". Yet, six years later, he's a dinosaur out of step with the times. Not only is he supposed to recognize the pen from ""Goldeneye"" but knows where the Aston-Martin is kept? He shouldn't be in the field, he should be in a nursing home thanks to Sam Mendes being so far out of his depth. He really should stick with his lackluster dramas and leave 007 in the hands of capable directors. And, adding insult to injury, he not only disposes of the quick-cut action that the last two had FINALLY brought back, he even dumps David Arnold's salutes to John Barry in favor of his friend Thomas Newman, who writes the worst background score since ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". There's no continuity between what Vesper Lynd reads from Bond's file to the massive Skyfall estate, now conveniently watched over by a caretaker I've heard was offered to Connery. Thank
God Connery passed, since his acting choices are usually lame. (Lest we forget, he passed on Gandalf) In which case, since we're
trying SO hard to be overly cute at this point, why not Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, or even George Lazenby? (small wonder why
""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" has become a classic in hindsight. Look at this junk!) So, we get Albert Finney, an excellent Scrooge years ago, but he can't even hold a consistent Scottish accent. But, by then, does it matter? Bad enough that we've had Dench interrogate Bardem in his Hannibal Lector style cell while 007 stands idly by looking steely eyed. And we've hinted that, by calling her ""Mommy"", Bardem may also have a Norman Bates thing going. And so, it ends with a firefight that Dench is as much a part of as Bond. Then, we throw in that Ralph Fienes, who's also been in a shootout by then, is now ""M"". Since he's a highly respected actor, and, in his case, as opposed to Dench and Bardem, I can see why, I'm sure, since he too has had past field experience, he'll have a huge part in the next one. Am I the only one who misses the ""M"" and ""Q"" of the 60s? And even the new
Moneypenny has had field experience. Is there ANYONE at MI6 who hasn't? I could go on with mistake after mistake but, I'd guess from its popularity, my opinion counts for little. So, I'll say only two more, hopefully, brief things. The Bond people, who spend more time in court than doing these films and perhaps should've just been lawyers, waited an extra year to bring Mendes back for the next one. That would've been like Howard Hawks waiting an extra year on filming the original ""The Thing"" just so he could get Ed Wood to direct it! And, lastly, Bond shouldn't even bother shooting the traditional unseen assassin at the end. Daniel Craig should
simply step into the circle and say ""Thank you all for playing our game. I'm sorry no one won. But the employees of the theater do have some lovely parting gifts for you"".",1417219200,3,5050,4.520218579234973

5029332,5,B006X040NY,"I wrote elsewhere that the James Bond ""movies are, while more PC than the books, to the right of most Hollywood productions--a key to their long-standing success.""  Does Skyfall, the latest Bond movie, validate that thesis or contradict it?

The role of the intelligence services has, of course, become highly controversial in our own day and age.  We all recall George Tenet's unfortunate assurance to President George W. Bush that finding WMD in Iraq would be a ""slam dunk"" and the disastrous and tragic consequences of poor intelligence (""Don't worry, it's a slam-dunk"" according to Bob Woodward's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-of-Attack-The-Definitive-Account-of-the-Decision-to-Invade-Iraq/dp/0743255488/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan of Attack:  The Definitive Account of the Decision to Invade Iraq</a>).

The Jason Bourne movies, which play off of cynicism aroused by real-life intelligence failures, are essentially ""James Bond for liberals"".  The equivalent(s) of the ""M"" character in the Bourne films is/are clearly deranged.  The intelligence chiefs in these movies have run amok.  They are sinister forces who do not merely make mistakes, but have become malignant forces for evil in our midst.  The Bourne films suggest that those in the highest levels of the Shadow world of intelligence are utterly corrupt betraying the interest of their nation for their own selfish ends.

The Bond movies, on the other hand, suggest an entirely different narrative in regard to the world of intelligence.  The principal reason for this has less to do with James Bond who is, after all,  a mere policy tool (a ""blunt instrument"") and much more to do with Bond's boss -- ""M"".

Ian Fleming based the ""M"" character in his novels on his boss during World War II the Director of Naval Intelligence, Rear Admiral John Henry Godfrey.  He was a competent and conscientious public servant.  ""The Naval Intelligence Division was responsible for collecting analyzing and distributing intelligence for the Admiralty, and providing security and counter-intelligence to the Royal Navy for the war at sea."" (For Your Eyes Only: Ian Fleming + James Bond).  At the NID, Fleming essentially played ""Bond"" to Godfrey's ""M"" (see earlier post Ian Fleming's Commandos, 10/14/12).  Fleming's father Valentine had been killed in the trenches in World War I and Godfrey became something of a father figure for Ian.

SkyFall, the most recent addition to the Bond series, places the ""M"" character, portrayed by Judy Dench at the very center and heart of this film.  Is her record perfect?  No.  Does she and MI6 make mistakes?  Unquestionably the answer is, ""yes"".  Nevertheless, she is like Admiral Godfrey -- a conscientious selfless and caring servant of the state.  She is, in fact, invaluable in the face of a threatening Shadow world of evil that lurks.  Politicians prattle on about ""transparency"" while the the real world of terrorist threats becomes increasingly opaque.  In spite of the influence of technology with its vast array of satellites and cell phone tracking the value of accurate human intelligence has never been greater than today.  We desperately need gifted devoted professionals like ""M"" and, of course James Bond -- because sometimes as Skyfall reminds us  ""a trigger does need to be pulled"" (see earlier post, Yvonne Fletcher RIP and Commander Bond?, 3/6/12).

Judy Dench is superlative as ""M"" or the ""Bond-mommy.""  Just as Admiral Godfrey was a surrogate father for Ian Fleming, she becomes the surrogate parents for the orphaned James Bond.

Next year will mark the official ""Diamond Jubilee"" of James Bond as Ian Fleming's Casino Royale&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-James-Bond/dp/1612185436/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale (James Bond)</a>&nbsp;was the first published in 1953 sixty years ago.  The 2006 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B0042C1BP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>&nbsp;introduced Daniel Craig, the blonde Bond, as a new MI6 agent making his very first ""licensed"" kills in the opening scene.  In 2012's Skyfall, Bond is no longer a novice, but rather an aging middle-aged single man with a shaky employment record and severe health challenges.  Bond is now ""an old dog learning new tricks"".

Early in the movie, Bond meets his new callow Quartermaster, ""Q"", in the National Gallery in front of a painting of the most popular painting in England--Turner's the Fighting Temeraire.  The choice of this particular painting near Trafalgar square to provide the backdrop for James Bond's own professional challenges is inspired.  The full title of Turner's painting is The Fighting Temeraire Tugged To Her Last Berth To Be Broken Up.  The Temeraire fought under Nelson in the Royal Navy's decisive victory over the Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805.  Now in 1838, when Turner observed her, she is headed for the scrap heap pulled by a satanic-looking steamboat that is belching black smoke.  Is Bond too destined for early retirement?  Is the Aston Martin headed for the wrecking yard?

It is remarkable to note that Skyfall debuted in the UK the very same week that the President of the United States disparaged the use of ""horses and bayonets"" in modern warfare -- in spite of the fact that the US Marine Corps still trains with and uses bayonets in the field -- Semper Fi.  The demise of Skyfall's villain, played brilliantly by Javier Bardem (the fortunate husband of Penelope Cruz), is a powerful argument for the continued relevance of ""cold steel"".  The traditional, conservative message is clear -- ""Old ways (gun, knife, radio) are often the best ways.""

Ian Fleming famously said, ""Everything I write has a precedent in Truth.""  Does Skyfall remain true to its Fleming heritage by having a ""precedent in truth""?  I believe that its gritty portrayals of the London Underground, its use of glossy settings in contemporary China (see earlier post, China Today, 9/11/12), its depiction of feckless politicians and even its use of the favorite weapon of the US Marine Corps allows us to answer happily in the affirmative.  President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, acting on the best Western intelligence available at the time, ""took the bloody shot"" on Iraq; we live with the consequences.

Skyfall ultimately advances the traditional and, ultimately, Conservative notion that public service undertaken by our military and intelligence forces at great personal risk is 1) necessary in a dangerous world 2) highly honorable and, at times, even 3) heroic.

""Three Cheers for Skyfall, sailing ships, MI6, the Royal Navy and cold steel!""

5029340,2,B006X040NY,"When the best part of this movie is a car (Aston Martin) making a cameo, you know there's something wrong.
Or maybe you're a retard or a whore working in the P.R. dep't placing 5 star reviews for this movie.
The start of this movie and end make no sense. The middle isn't much better. M, having no visual knowledge of the situation, orders Moneypenny (now a young girl on the field Bond scores with) to shoot Bond. Surely he's dead, considering the shot and the long fall, unconscious into the water. But of course he shows up alive, no explanation, of course, because there is no explanation for it that anyone could think of. He's Bond. He's immortal until he's replaced by the next Bond.  Then, with the endless money the Queen's MI5 and 6 have, all they can do to protect M is hide her in an old house in the middle of nowhere.  I'm glad M died in the end. She deserved it for getting Bond killed. Well, the franchise resurrected him right away like a video game character, so the movie can last 2+ hours. But hey, you can tell they put a lot of money into this movie and in spite of how ridiculous it is it's watchable. Not quite likable, though. Though there's something about the latest Bond, aspects of brutality and realism which make it interesting.  This whole franchise has gotten serious because more people are wise to what the Monarchy is really about, in my opinion.",1416873600,,1382,4.433070866141732

It begins with James Bond walking into a room and finding two bodies on the floor and a wounded man sitting on a chair. Leave him! There is a car chase, a crash, then a lot of shooting. Bond grabs a motorcycle to chase his target over the roofs! [No shortage of ammunition?] There is a shot at two fighting men. One falls, one gets away. Can Bond survive this? [This must be the most exciting start to any film in this series.] London is the headquarters of MI6 (foreign intelligence). A hard drive was lost with the names of undercover agents. [Why not just copy to a USB drive?] The head of the agency is told of her voluntary retirement. Someone has hacked into their computer system! Elsewhere Bond is recuperating and drinking. He hears about the terrorist attack in London. Bond returns to talk to M. Played out? Bond learns about the investigation. He is tested again. [This pads out the story.] Skyfall? Bond retrieves a microchip. [Dont try this at home!]

Bond meets another agent, then M and Mallory. He is back on active service. Should he retire? His next assignment is in Shanghai. [Is that Red China?] Good luck! Bond gets his equipment, then drives to an office building, empty at night. Can he hitch a ride? The intruder removes a device from his briefcase, aims and fires. Bond asks a question. The man won't talk. M learns that five names were posted to the Internet. Bond uses a razor. The old ways are best. [Especially if you cant learn the new ways.] Fireworks explode in the sky. Bond meets a woman at a bar in a casino. He notices things. Can he help her? She warns him. Good luck. You see a Komodo dragon do its thing. There are scenes to pad out the movie. I like you better without your Beretta. [Product placement or a lyric?] Later Bond is captured and meets the villain, from Station H. He talks about changing nature. Oh, Mr. Bond. The villain boasts of his powers and shows Bond around the island. Can Bond hit the target?

Will the villain be captured and brought back for questioning? Regret is unprofessional. What is his real name? He will be held in prison. M explains the trade. Silvas computer is studied. Will something go wrong? Bond explores the Tube and gets on the train. There is another chase. Then a train crash! M explains the threat. Bond runs along a street again. Silva and his men attend the meeting for more action! There is shooting and another chase. Bond and M drive along a rural road to an isolated and abandoned mansion. They prepare to meet their guests. There is more shooting and grenade explosions. Can Bond succeed against these odds? Yes. The last scene is by an old chapel. Silva threatens M. What have they done to you? Last rat standing. What took you so long? And so it ends. Field work isn't for everyone.

After fifty years these movies seem to be wearing out. I remember the movies from the 1960s and 1970s as being the best (although I haven't seen any for a long time). This movie does not have the villains or the threats of yesteryear. The dark tones make a somber picture. I think Craig is a good choice for an agent; he is more ordinary looking and doesnt stand out to attract attention. The older movies were more entertaining. There is enough shooting for a war movie. Its not a substitute for a poor plot. Think of a group that was selling oil and driving prices down. The Oil Cartel would certainly act against them. This story seems based on psychology or personal relationships, not on political conflict. It begins with spectacular stunts, this is its high point.",1415923200,,3569,4.520123839009288
5029406,5,B006X040NY,"I have been an enthusiastic fan of the James Bond series since Sean Connery came on the scene in Dr. No.  I liked all the actors playing James Bond with the exception of one (Roger Moore) who I thought did not really fit the character of 007.  This DVD (Skyfall) is the 23rd movie in this series and stars Daniel Craig as James Bond and Judy Dench as M.

I loved this movie and think it is one of the best James Bond adventures ever made. Daniel Craig has that hard look and physical skills to make the James Bond character come alive. The amazing actress Judy Dench is also great in the role of M. Like all Bond movies this one if filled with plenty of the kind of action we have grown to love in a 007 film.

Even though I have seen this movie in a theater I also purchased this DVD at a bargain price and immediately purchased it.  I loved seeing it again on DVD and think it is one of best of the James Bond Movies.  If you are a James Bond fan you may want to check out Skyfall because you can probably pick it up for a reasonable price.

5029540,5,B006X040NY,"I suppose this is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? That remains to be seen. With time, I see that this really is not a good Bond film in the traditional sense or is it? That is an interesting question. Time has a way of putting things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film when I first saw it. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting, yet it is very introspective and thought provoking. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film, but that may have been the intent all along. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. In retrospect, I think it is a good Bond film. Reflect on it I suppose. I still am. It may be one of the Classic Bonds. It just may be. SKYFALL was an event.

5029586,3,B006X040NY,"Skyfall puts Bond through the paces of a number of recent superhero movies dealing with aging and the limitations of the human body. Bond is put out of action early in te film and has to fight to regain a semblance of his former strength and agility. This makes for a more interesting film, but its a device that has been exploited in Watchmen as well as the Batman franchise.  The bad guy, a super-hacker (Javier Bardem) who can break into the most secure computer, has been used to great effect in Sherlock. And there's that weirdness with a couple of huge Komodo dragons that hearkens back to the sharks-with-lasers critique of the Austin Powers' film. And there's an attempt to paint Bond, a la Bruce Wayne, as the product of a horrid childhood, a facet of his character that the film steadfastly refused to explore. Why bring it up if you're not going to use it? I was less convinced by Bardem as a villain, his homosexuality (how deviant!) and was not thrilled with his ham-handed attempts to kill his enemies. For a smart guy who can destroy by remotely turning on gas lines, he relies too much on expendable henchman and military-grade weapons to do his heavy lifting . As with many villains, the need to be present personally at the death of his foes is a vanity that ultimately trips him up.

But I quibble. For its faults and not-quite-believability, I enjoyed Skyfall. The physicality of its train-top fights, the lethal threat of helicopter-led assaults, genre subverting weaponry, and the earnestness of Bond, M, Q to get the bad guys made it enjoyable. If only to discuss the endless ways it didn't make sense. But what a theme song!",1412985600,,1648,4.640410958904109

They heap praise and nonsequetors on it has the best Bond movie ever.

I did not find it to be such.  For me it appeared contrived, the plot forced, not flowing from moment to moment.
Very little of this movies plot progression made any sense.
Yes, I do expect a movie to be internally consistent to the laws of its own universe.  It can be an incredible fantasy but even the best of those follow the rules they lay down.  the first Star Wars movie, A New Hope, is a great example of this.

Now I get that everyone loves Bond. I love Bond, and especially Daniel Craig's Bond. He perfectly plays Bond as a sociopath. Clear headed, logical, determined and unfeeling.  Not since Sean Connery has an actor gotten it right about this character.  The first 2 movies were terriffic.  An excellent blend of intrigue, thinking and action.  This movie is not.
I love Dame Judy. she is a fantastic actor and has impressed me in the dozens of things I've seen her in.

I could give you a detailed blow by blow of the why but this video sums it up much better.

5029710,5,B006X040NY,"Bond. Merely uttering the name calls to mind fast cars, beautiful women, tuxedos, iconic villians, clever gadgets, and a Walther PPK. Because of this, people can be quite divided on the subject. Until this film, the Bond franchise had for me simply been a means of distraction, just something to watch, and while I thought the films were entertaining I didn't think any of them were especially good examples of film. If I were to write a list of films to see before you die, I would have only included Dr. No. and not because l believe that it was a great film, but because the Bond franchise as a whole is important in the history of film and people should at least be aware of it. Skyfall can now replace Dr. No on my list. In Skyfall, James Bond is no longer simply the world's coolest spy. He is an individual. He has a past that effects him, he has things he struggles with, like his place in a world where information itself has become a threat. This is someone with a psychology, someone we can identify with. The villain, Raoul Silva, is similarly more complex than villains of the past and if Bond was M's greatest success, Silva is M's greatest failure. And because Javier Bardem's performance as Silva is so brilliant and Bond's character so well written, at the end of the film when the two battle it out at the end of the film, you not only root for Bond, you find yourself feeling glad that Bond is the one facing Silva. This film is not only a Bond film, it is ""the"" Bond film.",1411344000,,1492,4.351254480286738

I have recommended this movie to many friends and all of them told me they loved the film. Some weren't originally fans of the film!
In my opinion the acting was brilliant and the use of music was well played. The story was pretty decent, but I shall let you all decide on that.

It should be noted that this film did come out during the 50th anniversary of James Bond and it was a spectacular way to celebrate it! You really have to give this film a shot",1410825600,,632,4.172131147540983

What I liked about the movies was what made James Bond as a character. He was a womanizer, had a sarcastic sense of humor, and the best was the cool gadgets that always got him out of a jam.
This new movie got the greatest reviews by most people, but for me it could've been any spy movie. There were no gadgets, no real love interests, and was pretty grim. Don't get me wrong, the movie was entertaining, but if the new villain is going to be computer hackers; well, I can see other better movies that deal with that subject. I like the old campy Bond.",1410393600,,646,4.176

5029863,3,B006X040NY,"Skyfall (Sam Mendes, 2012)

A little less than an hour into Skyfall, it was too late to stay awake, so I paused it and went to bed. The next morning, I asked on Facebook if I was the only one who found it a confused, muddled mess, and given the outpouring of love for it, wondered if it got better. The unanimous answer was yes, it got a lot better, so I went back to it that evening. Less than a minute after I turned the movie back on, there was Javier Bardem. Javier Bardem has the almost singular quality of making every movie he appears in a better work, and his presence in Skyfall was sorely needed. It stayed better after that, and for that I was truly grateful.

As we open, Bond (Daniel Craig in his third outing as 007) is in the throes of trying to save a fellow agent, Ronson (TV stalwart Bill Buckhurst in his first feature appearance), who is in danger of death, against the express orders of M (Judi Dench) and Eve (28 Days Later...'s Naomie Harris), the third operative on the team. Things go south, and we end the sequence with Bond hiding away somewhere in the tropics, turning his love of a good shaken-not-stirred martini into a nightmarish bout with dependency until he chances on a new report about a terrorist attack on MI6 headquarters. Bond returns, only to have M tell him that before he can go back out into the field, he has to pass all the tests again. And all this while trying to figure out who's got MI6 on the defensive, and how he seems to know so much about their movements, defenses, and infrastructure...

I ended up looking at that first hour as setupa whole lot of setup. And I am not sure the movie would have worked without it. This is a very meta Bond; if you were to look at a spy movie where the main character wasn't known for quaffing martinis, the slip into alcoholism in the tropics wouldn't be nearly as meaningful, and that's only one of the places where the film pays lip service to updating the character for modern sensibilities. (The new version of Q, amusingly played by The Zero Theorem's Ben Whishaw, is the most notable bend in this angle; the new Q has dropped the focus on gadgets and is far more interested in cyberterrorism. For the good guys, of course.) This almost by definition makes the film vertical-market; if you are not already an established fan of the series, Skyfall will not only not do anything to convince you, it may well drive you off. And yet, once the film takes off, Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, and Albert Finney as Skyfall's caretaker (the film's namesake estate, the Bond family pile in Scotland) all turn in their A levels with aplomb. This is the Daniel Craig of Layer Cake, the Judi Dench of Iris, the Albert Finney of The Dresser. And Bardem? He just has to show up to bring his top-level game; I can think of a single Bardem movie I've seen where he didn't tear the screen apart (For the record, it was D&iacute;as Contados, I've seen eleven Bardem films, and he was the star of the movie that has topped my top 1000 movies list since 2000, Before Night Falls). Mendes directing his first non-R film may have been a strength rather than a weakness; he flirted with that line every chance he could, and in the process managed his most successful blend of talkiness and action yet. Well, seventy-two minutes of it, anyway. Pity about the first hour. If you're already invested in the series, you need to see it, but then you don't need a review to tell you that. If you're not, start with something more accessibleeither version of Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, and A View to a Kill are all good starting points for the series. ***",1408579200,4,3620,4.416167664670659

The position is subsequently filled by Ralph Fiennes' character, Gareth Mallory.

FILM FACT: The film won several accolades, including Two BAFTA Awards, Two Academy Awards and Two Grammys. The song was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

Andrews Blu-ray Review  When it comes to James Bond, the old ways can be a mixed bag. The series always had a tendency to run campy when given the chance. People normally blamed it on Roger Moore, but the truth is that tongue-in-cheek Bond can be tracked back all the way to 'Goldfinger.' The level of seriousness has waxed and waned over the course of the series, but by the time of Pierce Brosnan's final outing, 'Die Another Day', it was clear that Eon needed to take their property more seriously. Thankfully they did, and with Daniel Craig on board as 007, they pulled a complete 180 degrees. Gone were the gadgets, the ridiculous villains, and most of the jokes. And as great as 'Casino Royale' was, there was a sense of something missing (and the less we say about the muddled, at times disastrously undercooked 'Quantum of Solace' the better).

That something has finally been returned in 'Skyfall', the latest and so far greatest of Craig's outings as the iconic secret agent. The film opens with Bond chasing after a hard drive that contains the names of covert agents around the world. Accidentally shot by his partner, Eve [Naomie Harris], Bond falls off a moving train and disappears, presumed dead. Meanwhile, M [Dame Judi Dench] is being forcibly retired as a result of her screw-up, but not before a mysterious opponent hacks her computer and blows up her office. Languishing in exile, James Bond hears of the attack and returns. Despite not being wholly ready for the mission in front of him, M sends him out to find the villain pulling the strings.

'Skyfall' is about James Bond facing his legacy, both as a character and a franchise. Given that 'Casino Royale' was a reboot, it seems a bit early to be playing the over the hill card with James Bond, but it's nice to see the filmmakers acknowledging that Bond can't be young forever, hopefully sparing us the embarrassment of another aging Bond running around like he were 20 years younger. The plot contrivance also allows Bond to go through a crucible that acts as more of a rebirth than the last two films did. And Daniel Craig rises to the occasion, bringing a melancholy to the character that has never been seen before.

'Skyfall' also pushes James Bond into the realm of the prestige film, scoring A-list director Sam Mendes ('American Beauty' and 'Road To Perdition' where he first worked with Daniel Craig) to turn a by-the-numbers franchise into something a little more elevated. Oh, don't worry, this movie still hits all the essential James Bond marks, and Sam Mendes has a refined eye for action, but now the drama is as important as the big set pieces. Sam Mendes brings along his own collaborators, much to the film's benefit. Thomas Newman's score injects some fresh blood into the series' music, while still making appropriate use of the classic themes. Even more impressive is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which has justly been nominated for an Academy Award. Roger Deakins creates a fantastic interplay of light and shadow that gives James Bond a mystique that the grit and grain of the last two films lacked.

In fact, 'Skyfall' takes many of its cues comes from another recent critical and commercial action/drama blockbuster: Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'. The basics of the plot are remarkably similar, as is the suddenly vulnerable hero seeing a dark reflection of himself in the film's villain. Javier Bardem lights up the screen as the evil Raoul Silva. He's got a touch of old-Bond outrageousness, with a sense of panache that's wholly new. He doesn't even appear on screen until halfway through the film, and when he does, it's an unforgettable entrance that sets the stage for everything that comes afterward. Raoul Bardem's turn here is even more impressive when you consider that he's already played a hypnotic psycho assassin in 'No Country For Old Men', and the two performances bear no similarities whatsoever.

The other piece of the puzzle comes from an unexpected source. Dame Judi Dench is the second longest running actor (after the inimitable Bernard Lee) to play M, taking over the role in 1995's 'Goldeneye'. In that film, she famously called James Bond a ""misogynist dinosaur"". Over the Pierce Brosnan years, she softened to him, and with Daniel Craig she took on a matronly role that is brilliantly explored in 'Skyfall'. Although this isn't the first time M's past actions have come back to haunt her (that particular plot point was first brought to bear in the tepid 'The World Is Not Enough'), 'Skyfall' smartly re-appropriates the idea, making it central to not just the plot, but also to the character motivations. By making Bond question his reasons for becoming a secret agent, and the nature of his relationship with M, he's finally able to become the 007 we know and love.

Sam Mendes, along with writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan, understand that even though Craig represents the start of a new type of James Bond, he's also the inheritor of the entire Bond legacy. For the first time since 'Goldeneye', James Bond feels British again. A large segment of the film takes place in London, and there's not just Bond's trademark wit, but also the stiff upper lip of Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory and the cocky smugness of Ben Whishaw as a young Q. There are clear nods to previous entries in the series: An out of nowhere Komodo dragon is intentionally reminiscent of Roger Moore leaping over crocodiles in 'Live and Let Die', a joke about an exploding pen is a direct nod to Pierce Brosnan's tenure, and a certain four-wheeled vehicle makes an entrance that generated spontaneous applause from the audience every time I saw it in theatres. There's even a part that was written for Sean Connery, although sadly the original 007 does not appear here. Even the film's theme song, brilliantly sung by the acclaimed and accomplished British singer Adele recalls the torch songs Shirley Bassey made famous for the series. And of course, Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins are British themselves, although interestingly it took Jame Bond to get Sam Mendes to make a British film about British people, the rest of his films being about Americans.

'Skyfall' skilfully manages to synthesize the old with the new, bringing Bond into the modern world even more successfully than its successors (although that isn't meant to be a slight on the still excellent Casino Royale). By acknowledging the past, Sam Mendes and company find the license to reinvent it. By the time we reach the film's closing credits, Bond as a character and a franchise is finally where we've wanted it to be since 2006: All the pieces in place to deliver classic James Bond adventures with all of the series trademarks intact, but not simply going through the motions. It's appropriate that the movie was released fifty years after the original release of 'Dr. No', the first Jame Bond adventure that set the stage for all the rest to follow. We can only hope that 'Skyfall' has infused enough creative blood back into the proceedings that we can see James Bond on top of his game for another fifty years.

Blu-ray Video Quality  I remember being surprised, pleased, and excited to hear that Sam Mendes would be directing the new James Bond picture, but my real excitement bloomed into complete and utter giddy fanboy glee is when I heard that Roger Deakins would be the film's cinematographer. Roger Deakins' is justly famous for his previous work with Sam Mendes, as well as his long-time collaboration with the Coen Brothers (among many other classic films like 'The Shawshank Redemption'). His work has a textural quality that brings images to life, and this quality is very much present in 'Skyfall.' Scenes such as the fight in Hong Kong set against a massive screen backdrop, or the film's climax in Scotland, lit by raging fires, are all trademark Roger Deakins. But even moments like the opening shot, showing an out of focus Bond in the background, slowly walking to foreground (and focus) and lifting a gun (a shot that Sam Mendes refers to a reimagining of the classic gun barrel sequence, the traditional version of which can be seen at the film's end) reveal an eye for composition and detail that no James Bond film has ever had before.

For a film with such a stunning visual palette, it was important to get the transfer right. Thankfully, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayers stunning encoded 1080p image and the aspect ratio 2.40:1 transfer is also stunning, maintaining all the subtlety and shading that Roger Deakins brought to the theatrical release. The aforementioned opening shot is perfectly reproduced and everything from the icy blues of London to the warm, slightly pushed colours of Macau come through cleanly. Flesh tones are accurate to the release prints, with a bit of an orange push at times. Contrast, an important element of Roger Deakins' technique, is well balanced, with deep blacks but strong whites. Sharpness and detail are exquisite. You can count the stubble on Daniel Craig's chin before Eve Moneypenny intimately shaves it all off. I was unable to detect any artefacts or other compression issues, leaving an image that is sharp, clear, and perfectly timed and balanced. Films like this justifies 100% the existence of Blu-ray all on their own.

It is worth noting that 'Skyfall' was released to IMAX theatres, both digitally and in, and for those releases, the film's framing was opened up from 2.40:1 to 1.85:1 to take advantage of the extra height that IMAX affords. In a proper IMAX auditorium, the taller ratio was quite effective, helping immerse the audience in the proceedings. However, it was never Sam Mendes' or Roger Deakins' preferred aspect ratio, and it rightly does not appear on this Blu-ray disc. To my eyes, the 2.40:1 composition is much tighter and highlights only exactly what you need to see, meaning that the lack of the 1.85:1 version on the disc shouldn't be seen as any kind of loss.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  James Bond films has always had a way with sound. Going all the way back to 'Dr. No' and the sound crew has been considered among the top of the industry. By now, big sound mixes are the norm for action films, but a good James Bond track still stands apart. A large part of this is due to the music. John Barry composed many classic themes that are as much a part of the series as any other element (take a look at 'Never Say Never Again' to see an example of a film that has many other James Bond trademarks, including Sean Connery as 007, but feels completely off because you never hear any of John Barry's familiar music). Long-time James Bond composer David Arnold did an admirable job of filling John Barry's shoes from 'Tomorrow Never Dies' through to 'Quantum of Solace', but Sam Mendes smartly chose to bring in his own collaborator, Thomas Newman, to score this entry. Thomas Newman's score makes ample use of John Barry's work, but also goes in several new directions. At times he makes use of locale-specific instrumentation, and other times he uses a more traditional symphonic arrangement, but no matter how he presents it, his music is the most interesting and inventive that the series has had in decades.

The disc's 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a great job of highlighting Thomas Newman's work. For an action film, the music is surprisingly prominent. Of course, the action isn't neglected either. Dynamic range is fantastic, handling everything from the warm strings, hearty and sometimes shrill brass of the music, and rumbling of the action with equal aplomb. Directionality and panning is seamless, with bullets ricocheting around the sound field and a thrilling deep track that comes to life and shakes your seats. Even more impressive is the sound field and sonic details in the film's softer scenes. The whisk of the cutthroat razor as Eve lovingly shaves James Bond has a satisfying glint, and the sounds of MI6 personnel working at their stations underneath London makes those scenes feel wonderfully alive. Even when it's just two characters talking, such as when M confronts Silva in a glass cage, the voices reverberate pleasingly, with Javier Bardem's snake oil voice standing in contrast to Dame Judi Dench's clipped, curt performance. 'Skyfall' is a film that is just as fulfilling aurally as it is visually, and this mix is a fantastic reproduction of the theatrical experience and in my mind sounds even better via one Home Cinema Amplifier, at least you do not have to put up with people eating popcorn or slurping on the their massive drinks.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Shooting Bond [59:00] Actually a series of shorter documentary that can be played as an hour-long making of documentary, Shooting Bond is a solid cursory overview of what it takes to make a James Bond film. Interviews with the major cast and crew give a lot of insight into the process, and behind the scenes footage is mixed in, but mainly played under the interview dialogue. There are too many clips from the film for my taste, given that I can watch the film anytime I like, and each individual segment is really too short to truly go in-depth, but there are a lot of great moments to see (Naomie Harris going through gun training was a personal favourite for me).

SKYFALL Premiere [1080p] [4:28] Scenes from the world premiere at the Royal Albert Hall, featuring interviews with Mendes, Craig, Harris, Bardem, Fiennes, Whishaw et al.

Commentary by Director Sam Mendes: Director Sam Mendes sits down and discusses the making of 'Skyfall'. Sam Mendes covers a lot of ground, from finding inspiration in the final three Ian Fleming novels to working with Roger Deakins, Newman, and Editor Stuart Baird. He talks about his aesthetic decisions, such as choosing to shoot with a smaller number of cameras than is normal for a James Bond film in order to make each shot more deliberate, and shooting the shaving scene with a Alfred Hitchcock maxim in mind: ""Shoot your murders like love scenes and your love scenes like murders."" He also tosses in a few fun bits of trivia, such as the fact that the exterior of M's London flat was actually John Barry's house. Sam Mendes does sometimes fall prey to describing what's happening on scene, but usually if he does this it's to explain a bit of pacing or scene construction. If you loved the film, then this engaging, smart, information-rich commentary is an essential listen.

Commentary by Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner: Series producers Barbara Broccoli (daughter of ""Cubby"" Broccoli, one of the franchise's original producers) and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner get together to watch the movie, and sometimes talk. This is almost the exact opposite of Sam Mendes' commentary. The three spend a lot of time simply watching what's on screen, commenting on elements within the frame, and rarely saying much of relevance. Michael G. Wilson and ""Cubby"" Broccoli in particular feel as if they've attended a few too many press junkets where they've have to blandly endorse their latest movie, regardless of whether it was actually good or not. A few good comments manage to make it through, but if this commentary were left off the disc, no one would have mourned its absence.

Theatrical Trailer [1080p] [2:31] A smartly constructed action trailer that highlights great moments without giving too much away.

Soundtrack Promotional Spot [1080p] [1:00] A short brief introduction by composer Thomas Newman conducting the orchestra playing his score to advertise the CD soundtrack.

Promotional Trailers [16:00] BOND 50th Anniversary Blu-ray Special, A Good Day To Die Hard and Taken 2

Finally, 'Skyfall' completes Daniel Craig's transition from rough and tumble Bond to a more classic, suave, sophisticated figure. Director Sam Mendes and his collaborators bring a level of prestige and artistic legitimacy to the film that the franchise has never had before, but never at the expense of what makes James Bond great. The series once again feels British, wholly revitalized, and surprisingly touching. It's a fantastic springboard for a whole new series of Bond adventures in the coming years. This Blu-ray has reference level audio video quality, with a transfer that perfectly reproduces Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematographic compositions and an audio mix that ably highlights Thomas Newman's exciting score. The special features are a bit of a mixed bag, with Sam Mendes' commentary being a definite highlight. The hour-long Shooting Bond feature is just good enough that you'll wish it was double the length. The rest of the features are fairly slight, but what we get is absolutely good enough to recommend wholeheartedly and a must own for all James Bond fans, like me. What I also love is the beautiful designed Limited Edition SteelBook inside and out, which was exclusive to Amazon in the UK and of course has now gone pride of place in my all inclusive James Bond Blu-ray Collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

After a near death experience, Bond is able to more objectively examine his human side and that he isn't eternal. He realizes that evil is in the eye of the beholder; one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and it forces him to make some decisions about his future. Throughout the movie, he is confident of his abilities, but questions the motives of those around him, good guys and bad guys. In the end he answers many questions for himself and puts many ghosts out to pasture. I have read that this is Daniel Craig's last Bond movie - while many didn't like him in the role, I feel he brought an edgy, gritty reality to a character that had almost become a cartoon figure (Roger Moore turned Bond into a buffoon) and did a good job of relaunching the series for a new generation. While James Bond doesn't exist in our real world, there are many heroes like him that face evil daily on our behalf - don't forget to thank them and remember them in your prayers.",1407456000,,1280,4.497854077253219

If I could, I'd put Xena in a room with Bond and charge people to watch her kick his a--.

All that being said, the new Bond films are better than what they were.  Still not crazy about the way women are depicted but I get that it's a male fantasy.  Mr. Craig is definitely worth watching.  I preferred him in Layer Cake, but he is the hotness so I guess he's a good Bond.  It's a good movie.  My guest liked it and I liked the cut of Mr. Craig's clothes.

Fact is, Austin Powers was doing better Bond movies in the 90s/early 2000s. Glad the new ones are somewhat grounded in reality, and you can totally tell the influence The Dark Knight had on the way this film was shot, and there is nothing wrong with that at all.

From the incredible score by Adele, to the writing, acting and direction, Skyfall soars high above any Bond film ever made.  And by the way, Skyfall just happens to be the most financially successful British film ever made for all the aforementioned reasons.  While I've always enjoyed James Bond movies, with the exception of those made with Roger Moore that were too comedic for me, I've never bought any on video or on DVD until Daniel Craig became the new Bond in Casino Royale.

  Now, in the original James Bond movies, there were all kinds of gadgets ( except for Dr. No, the very first JB movie.) The new JB movies have far fewer gadgets than the originals did but, they are going further into drama. This is typical of females as opposed to men, who tend to be more action oriented.
 Ok, enough background generalization. On to the movie. I didn't like this one very much but, I really did like the remake of Casino Royale. I thought that one was pretty darned good Since I didn't like SKYFALL all that much, I only gave it a three star review. -- JT

Because this movies captures the essence of the 007 life (flashy cars, beautiful women, mysterious characters, etc.)

It also does justice to old bond fans bringing back old trademark features of bond while putting him in the modern tech-run world.

The movie also takes the viewer to exotic and scenic lands. All the scenes have background settings which compliment the personality of the scene.

Great music by adele also featured.

Definitely one of the best Bond movies out in a while.",1403568000,,506,4.976190476190476

The strained yet fun chemistry between Craig and Judy Dench is undeniable. Javier Bardem is the best villain yet, nothing like a former 00 to thicken the plot(reference Sean Bean in Golden Eye).  To be honest the new Moneypenny is beautiful and charismatic but as different as Daniel Craig and Roger Moore from the previous versions. Best Bond yet!",1403308800,,506,4.611111111111111

My only issue(s) are I wish Amazon had an App for MAC (Apple) to view Amazon Prime Video so that it's easier to watch a video in a Home Theater environment. I use Plex on my Mac Mini and I have a Oppo Blue-Ray player that utilizes apps for Nexflx and other streaming services, but neither has a Amazon app.

The villain appears to have a simple wish, to kill Ma, and  could easily have done it if he simply tracked her and shot her.  Instead, he takes over the computer system of the secret service agency, does incredible damage, but could have done much more by releasing more of the names of the imbedded agents with whom he would more likely be sympathetic than angry.  The detective work with which they tracked the villain was just blind luck.  In the end, when Ma and a helper were escaping in the night, they chose to use a flashlight, which of course got them spotted.  It was so stupid, one would scream if they still cared about the movie by that point.  After fighting a man under icy water, Bond then swims down to get something to allow him to break through the ice.  Hello, it is nighttime.  You can't see and you are frozen and out of breath.

The thing I found most interesting about the movie was discovering what Skyfall actually was.  If you watch this movie in sequence like I did, you will get thrown off a bit by the ending of Quantum of Solace. (Quantum is the name of a mysterious organization that surfaces in the 2 previous Bond movies) Well what appears to be revenge of Quantum turns out to be a more personal revenge, or is it supposed to be both - I don't know - I was confused by it.

Anyhow, this movie actually makes more sense when watched as a separate movie - standard bad guy with evil plot to take over the supply of (anti-spoiler).

From the absence of exploding pens to the classic Aston Martin with the red ejector seat button. While I think only more seasoned audience members would actually understand the references they were well placed. What killed the movie for me was the ending. Not to spoil it, I will be vague. The complexity and technical hacker jargon along with complex graphics and oversimplicity of hacking advanced networks made it seem overdone, even for someone with a good understanding of programming and networking techniques. I feel they tried too hard and had to make the complex and sophisticated graphics so that they could show the audience something complex, fully understanding that it would be over everyone's heads. They built the show from the start in a 'back to grass roots' style and ended on a similar note. Then, in the middle, they pulled a Batman takes the Joker to Jail bit and filled the sequence with a bunch of over the top jargon and pretty pictures. It was an abrupt discontinuity that seems like it was injected into the script to capture the younger audience. Aside from this, I felt that Daniel Craig portrays a very dry, to the point, Bond with good judgement but psychological baggage that one would expect from his experiences and training. Past bonds overly portray him and a poon hound that causes Bonds actions to be reckless but so far Craig strikes a good balance between orders, leisure, and the mission.",1402185600,,1538,4.807547169811321

5030382,2,B006X040NY,"First, I'm a fan of the James Bond franchise. I own all of them including the other Casino. In this latest installment, the minimalistic trend continues which is not a bad thing. The stunts are, as usual, more than fair to middling. I'm pretty sure I'll get the Bond Girl wrong but the new Moneypenny floats my boat and more. There's some pretty good acting especially from the bad guy. Different, but appreciated.
The plot in itself is pretty good with the exception of the way M's sins are portrayed. And THAT is the main problem with the film. Why does the villain jump through so many hoops to get his revenge? His mastery of all things computer, his endless resources both financial and manpower says I can do whatever, whenever. Why risk everything? Countless skin of his teeth saves, expenditures designed to bring reputations down only to have some silly, costly showdown. Were I a henchman in his employ, there would be a tendered resignation early on. And speaking of silly showdowns, wouldn't you, as Bond, utilize all the weaponry available? As far as that goes, wouldn't you bring more than a knife to a gunfight? It's not like he didn't have time. He acquires new transport but no weapons?

5030388,5,B006X040NY,"I have always enjoyed James Bond films, a franchise that began when I was a kid. The action does not disappoint. Although I realized that the story lines were very predictable, I still liked the movies. During high school, college, and the years that followed, I was always involved in the discussions about who was the best Bond. I am now convinced that the best Bond is Daniel Craig. I really like the darker tone of the movies. The action is still there, but there is more substance to these movies, especially in Skyfall. In the short time this movie has been out, I can say I have probably seen it as much as any other Bond film. Bond movies are not all I watch, as my wife and I like a variety, that includes dramas, comedies, independent, and foreign films. With this in mind, I must say that the final hour of Skyfall is among the best in movie history. It has suspense, action, emotion, and you find out some interesting details about Bond's past. Another great element to this movie (AND the final hour) is the soundtrack by Thomas Newman. I have quite the collection of movie soundtracks, including almost every Bond soundtrack that John Barry wrote. Nevertheless, Newman's music is fantastic. I first came to know his music when I saw the 1998 film, Meet Joe Black...another great soundtrack. With Skyfall, Newman keeps the well known James Bond themes, but the new elements wonder. It seems Newman uses more of the orchestra, than Barry did, which offers far more flexibility in establishing moods. Perhaps a good testament to how good this movie comes from a friend of mine. He and his wife had never watched a James Bond movie. I told him how good the movie was, so they put it on their rental list. They not only loved the movie, they actually watched it twice. They fact that they knew nothing about James Bond movies indicates that the movie just stands on its own.",1401840000,,1883,4.57396449704142

And the wonderful old Bond family estate house and land, with the ancient chapel and protective underground features, set in the always-compelling Scottish highland, are fascinating to me.

5030416,5,B006X040NY,"For me, this is not one of the best Bond films...it IS the best Bond movie. Beautiful production, great acting alongside a well crafted script and performed by a truly talented cast.

Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond, he inbues his spy with layers and depth that even the great Sean Connery could not. After all Connery was not a greatly skilled actor when he took on the role back in 1962 in Dr No.

Placing  much at the action back into London helps adds a deliver 'realness', although we still get the amazing set pieces in glorious locations, but seeing London Town take centre stage in this film is stirring, after all Bond is a British.

We are also given a tiny glimpse into his background, eluded to in Casino Royale. It may just be me, but def. the best Bond film ever and the fact that the theme tune is delivered through soaring strings and horns by none other than Adele seals the deal.

Unfortunately, in Skyfall, we don't get to see him in action as much as the last couple of Bond films. I do understand that as the story goes, he's a bit out of shape and not fit for duty and that may have been the part the director wanted to show for Bond, but it did take a lot of the potential action out of portions of the movie.

Surprises with the introduction of a new ""Q"" and a welcome face --Moneypenny.

In the movie there was a lot of attention to the fact that he is ""old"", although, as always, he got the job done.

This one has a few Goldfinger items in it.  You can tell that the film had a good size budget.  Acting, filming and writing is higher than some of the other ""free movies"" available on Amazon Prime.  Don't expect a real thoughtful or thinking movie, this one is pure 007, so don't think, just watch.  Listen though to the quipes by M on the nostalgic pieces.  It's worth a laugh.

5030570,1,B006X040NY,"My favorite James Bond Movies in order of preference:
1. You Only Live Twice
2. Gold Finger
3. Thunderball
4. Casino Royal
and so on

I can list them all but any true Scholar of the series will see from this list why I loathe this terrible movie.  A few of the reasons why I believe this is among the worst Bond films:
1. It is not fun.  When did James Bond become a sour bitter sad sack? Also, it was established in Casino Royal that Bond didn't come from privilege, he was a scholarship kid at prep school.  When did Bond become Batman? Rich dead parents dark brooding manner etc. We don't want to know and this is Sam Mendes messing with the Cannon.
2. It doesn't follow it's own rules or any rules.  Silva knows exactly when his laptop will be accessed so he can escape exactly at the perfect moment so he will be pursued down a tunnel at exactly the perfect moment his bomb will go off to send a subway train into the tunnel to kill Bond.  If this isn't the case then he is simply bombing a subway train for no reason.  Great he is evil.  Then once he escapes his whole plan is to shoot M in court.  WOW! Perfectly orchestrated capture/escape just to shoot shoot someone in a courtroom. Couldn't he find any better place to do this? This is very bad plotting.
3. There is no strong female lead in this movie.  An interesting romantic lead is introduced and then killed and then Moneypenny is reintroduced in a totally one dimensional role where she is shown to suck as an agent. Also, James Bond sleeps with Moneypenny which is another deviation from Cannon.  This is never supposed to happen.
4. This movie turns James Bond into a total idiot. Why would he flee with M to ""Skyfall"" this is a dumb conceit a shallow premise a poor plot device and an uninspired location.  It screams ""final Boss Battle"" and manages to inspire all of the tension of a Teletubbies cartoon.
I could go on.  I am so sad that Sam Mendes is being given the reins of the next Bond Film as well. This is like giving Star Wars back to George Lucas.",1399334400,6,2027,4.274869109947644

5030581,5,B006X040NY,"From a die hard Connery fan, Craig plays the conflicted, driven, and damaged Bond the best.  Strength in all the wrong places for emotional attachment, and the subtlety of a sledge in work.  That they play on his age is a plus, not ignoring father time.  They wrapped it up nicely in the end, bringing the standard 'bond-isms' into play.

I hope to see more quality installments here.  Quantum was just an extension of 'Casino', but this one made up for it.  Highly recommended.",1399161600,,478,4.630952380952381

But he cleans up well. He is able to convince you that he is able to be as brutal as he has to be to survive what he does, but is also suave enough to charm the ladies. I believe this Bond in the way that I believed Flemming's. I enjoyed Connery's as a fun fiction to watch, but not to believe as possibly real. Craig is Bond. Connery is Bond. They are just different Bonds.

Skyfall answers questions that have never been answered. We get a picture of Bond's history never shown before, and is a shake up. This is an excellent depiction showing how the world sees spies, espionage, and the necessity for the shadows.",1398902400,,793,4.217105263157895

SPOILER ALERT:
The plot is entertaining, but Bond fundamentally loses to the bad guy.  Bond fails to save the girl and he fails to save his boss.

Also a minor point:  You have to suspend your disbelief that Bond would have a classic Aston Martin DB5 in his personal storage WITH spy gadgets (ejector seat and hidden machine guns).  I thought the producers were trying to make the Daniel Craig ""generation"" of Bond movies more realistic, so I was dissappointed to see this element in the movie.  The story would have done just as well with a gadget-free DB5.  Then the story would have been more realistic.",1398816000,,670,4.533333333333333

5030600,3,B006X040NY,"The new James Bond movies just don't have the cachet of the old ones that were based on Ian Fleming's books. Perhaps it is because of the end of the Cold War, perhaps the proliferation of action movies, maybe even the overdose of action and incredible stunts.  Daniel Craig is a good actor, but somehow doesn't fit the part like Sean Connery or Roger Moore. The story got lost in all the bang bang shoot-em-up for me.  If they would rein in the action to maybe 50% of what it was and do more of the nuances and story telling, I would like it better.  The villain was not out to take over the world this time, just out to even a score with one person, and there was really no ""Bond Girl"" in this movie.  There was also a concerted effort to replace all the standard characters: Q, Moneypenny, and ""M"".  It kind of disrupted what little plot there was.",1398816000,2,850,4.254658385093168

5030606,3,B006X040NY,"A typical Bond thriller  Few plot twists in this one with the requisite quota of fights (both with fists and hand-to-hand), lovely women who provide momentary distractions and then target practice, and gorgeous location scenery.  Looking forward to the new Moneypenny and Ralph Fiennes joining the ensemble. Albert Finney had a nice turn as Kincade, as well.  Javier Bardem ably served as the required over the top ""super"" villain. All in all, a pleasant diversion but longer than necessary.",1398816000,,491,5.189873417721519
5030607,1,B006X040NY,"More excitement, not as much FX watching grass grow. Poorly written plot. Actors standing around like they don't know what to do next. OH please give me ""The Croods.""  It's a much better movie. Take your kids and enjoy!",1398729600,4,219,4.615384615384615
5030608,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is pushing for my favorite Bond ever.  The story takes several twists, some of which are obvious, others of which are a little surprising.  The story, from what I can remember, flows well and has few to no plot holes.  If you're a Bond fan, or just enjoy movies that move quickly, I would recommend you check this one out.",1398729600,,335,4.370967741935484

5030613,5,B006X040NY,This movie is everything you expect from James Bond and it leaves you begging for more.  Loved the action of course and the tie in to the original Sean Connery series.  The vulnerability of 007 is emphasized and it added to the tension of the situation.  Another icky antagonist well played.  I enjoyed this movie and look forward to the next.,1398729600,,343,4.573770491803279

5030617,3,B006X040NY,not as good as some other Bond movies. Plot a little thin. Villan's plans unbelievable in the max.  But fun.,1398729600,,108,4.4

5030623,4,B006X040NY,I find Daniel Craig as the best James Bond since Sean Connery. I like the fact that they keep humor (like roger Moore) to a minimum.,1398643200,,132,4.115384615384615
5030624,4,B006X040NY,"The same action scenes cars, trains, tall falls you expect in a Bond film. I would have rated it lower and almost didn't watch the entire movie. Glad now I stuck it out turned out the last 1/4 of the movie made it worth watching.",1398643200,,229,4.111111111111111
5030625,2,B006X040NY,Very dark picture. Hard to see the details.  Also very disjointed.  Goes from one action to the other but story line is doesn't flow well.,1398643200,,138,4.48
5030626,5,B006X040NY,Great movie. This time 007 movies is a little more closer to the truth than other 007 movies that is pure science fiction,1398643200,,121,4.304347826086956
5030627,5,B006X040NY,Skyfall was a great Bond It was one of Daniel Craig's best.  Perfect weekend movie adventure for entire family enjoyment.,1398643200,,121,5.05
5030628,4,B006X040NY,One action pack Bond movie with a lot of car chases and gun fights. Daniel Craig fits this roll all the way,1398556800,,107,3.909090909090909

5030632,2,B006X040NY,Just not my idea of James Bond.  Sean Connery was the best!  I gave up halfway through the movie. Perhaps a mistake on my part.,1398556800,,127,4.04

5030634,4,B006X040NY,"James Craig is my favorite James Bond since Sean Connery.  Casino Royale was just a bit better than this one with its very physical and very gritty portrayal of physical violence.  This one comes pretty close and is worlds better than Quantum of Crap was.  Javier Bardem is definitely my favorite Bond villain ever.  His performance was riveting.  As much as I enjoy Craig's performance, Bardem's was even better.",1398556800,,413,4.927536231884058
5030635,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is a bond like Sean Connery was.  It is unfortunate that movies today have to revolve around impossible visual effects.  The movie would be much better if it were more realistic; however, it would not be the box office draw it is and could not be made. :-(  So having said that, it is as goos as it can be for a major Hollywood movie can be in this day and age.  Judy is of course awesome as always!",1398556800,,412,4.049382716049383
5030636,5,B006X040NY,"Excellent movie .bond fans won't be disappointed . My favorite of the Daniel Craig bonds.

5030637,4,B006X040NY,Skyfall was a very entertaining movie but as a fan of the original 007 flicks it fell a little short. I just couldn't get that old feeling. It lacked the techie equipment and except for a brief scene with his old Astin Martin there just wasn't any automobiles worth mentioning. I would recommend this movie to any 007 fan though. Like I said it was entertaining.,1398470400,,362,4.5
5030638,5,B006X040NY,The movie was not the usual Bond film in some ways it was darker. Bond is older than we have ever seen him and yet there is plenty of the action that we expect from a Bond film. The surprise at the end was interesting and quite unexpected.,1398470400,,239,4.0
5030639,3,B006X040NY,"Sorry, Roger Moore and Sean Connery were Bond. the rest don't cut it, especially this one. Love Judi Dench, she can play anything and she is great in this.",1398470400,,155,4.379310344827586

5030642,4,B006X040NY,I like Daniel Craig's harder version of Bond.  He provides a much needed update to what Bond would need to be like during this decade.,1398470400,,134,4.36
5030643,3,B006X040NY,entertaining yet contrived.guess they had to do something to keep the franchise going....can't kill off 007 but M was an option,1398470400,,127,5.095238095238095

5030646,5,B006X040NY,Daniel Craig is the toughest Bond ever. He may lack some of the sophistication of previous Bonds but he is realistic as a disillusioned spy.,1398384000,,140,4.64
5030647,4,B006X040NY,Well worth the watch.  Daniel Craig is great as always.  I would watch any and all movies with him in it.,1398384000,,105,3.9523809523809526
5030648,3,B006X040NY,"In this outing we are back to Fleming's Bond, when James had to rely on his wits, his  gun and the knife in his boot to survive. Sadly, however, we are treated to the obligatory opening chase through a Turkish Bazaar and then a sequence ala Runaway Train which ends in Bond being shot by his own side then rescued  by a beautiful beachcomber after he goes over a waterfall. Naturally he chooses to remain with her, nursing his wounds mental and emotional, for a time. And despite Mi6's later claims that he is washed up physically, he still manages to perform the horizontal mambo, vertically, no less, while a piece of depleted uranium is embedded in his perfect pecs. I don't know about you, but I'd at least have a headache.

After an attack on London headquarters, he returns only to be seconded to Shanghai on the trail of an assassin, leading him to Mastermind Cyberterrorist Silva [ Bardem]. Silva has vowed revenge on his former boss, M, [ Dench] for turning him over to the Chinese, who tortured him. In no time at all, Bond hooks up with Silva's fascinating mistress, Severine, who unfortunately has all of ten minutes of screen time.

With a cast that includes Fiennes and Finney to boot, you'd think it would be an all around success, however Bardem's villain is so campy that the gorgeous Severine's twitchy terror of him seems unwarranted. Sure, he'll kill you for nothing, but, meh, he's just not scary.

Silva is coming after M, his surrogate Mommy Dearest, and has concocted an elaborate plot to get himself within striking distance, but not before Bond can whisk her away to Skyfall [the most hideous family seat in the entire UK] in his adorable Aston Martin. There they are met by crusty game keeper Albert Finney who has eyes for M and sure can shoot a sawed off shotgun. The biggest tragedy of the entire film  for me was when that lovely car was exploded to bits.

In any case, the art direction is just gorgeous and the best part of the film --from the opening credits to the marvelous fight scene in a Shanghai skyscraper against a backlit projection of a giant jellyfish.

Mindless and fun. Three and a half stars.",1398384000,,2140,4.5837696335078535

5030650,5,B006X040NY,One of the best Bond films. Great locations. Really good villians. Craig is a very good 007. Probably close to Connery.,1398384000,,119,4.714285714285714
5030651,4,B006X040NY,Maybe I am a little old fashion but James Bond is Sean Connery in my mind until I saw Skyfall.  Daniel Craig was excellent and the story line was excellent too. I am only sorry I waited so long to view the movie but I will definitely be watching it again!,1398384000,,255,4.0
5030652,3,B006X040NY,"Cinematography worthy of a Bond Film, but little else.  I was hoping for an upgrade to a New Era Bond, and found the writers hopelessly clinging to elements of the past.

5030653,5,B006X040NY,"An overall outstanding film. I would like to point out that this film modernized itself by bringing to life a true modern day problem, that of cybercrime. This means it did not have the archetype villain that you are familiar with.

But I will say that there is no Bond girl or neat gadgets and car in this film. Those are critical elements to 007. But the film is great nonetheless.",1398297600,,383,4.394366197183099
5030654,5,B006X040NY,Best Bond movie in a long time!  Having skipped it in theaters it was a pleasant surprise to find it was well worth paying the price to see it in theater.

5030658,3,B006X040NY,I grew up with a Bond that kicks butt takes names and gets the girl in a swuave kind of way. Not a bond that can't even shoot and hit his target. This movie was more about aging then 007. What are they gearing us up for a new Bond?,1398297600,,231,3.64
5030659,5,B006X040NY,First Craig is a great Bond. Hope he stays and makes a few more. Plot was very good and the action didn't disappoint. One of the best ones in the last 10 years.,1398297600,,160,3.878787878787879

5030664,5,B006X040NY,this movie actually shows James Bond slowing down.  Not that he isn't still the hero!  It is nice to see an icon ageing.,1398211200,,120,4.173913043478261

5030667,3,B006X040NY,Slow but good.  Seemed to take more time to explain the back story than action.  Bond movies suppose to be about action and women not much of either,1398124800,,148,4.25

The new Bond stories are great and this last one did not need all kinds of gadgets to get the job done. Hopefully this will continue in the next couple of movies. Skyfall is one that will be added to my collection.",1397865600,,381,4.148648648648648

5030688,5,B006X040NY,I love this movie and everything about it. The storyline was perfect and it shows how one of my favorite movie characters became the spy he is today. Great performances by Daniel Craig and Judi Dench. And the move theme song really cinches it.,1397779200,,243,4.545454545454546

5030703,3,B006X040NY,"It was filled with lots of action, which I am sure will hold most people's attention. I did enjoy that aspect. I was disappointed in the writers allowing the character to deviate somewhat from my expectations of 007. I was also disappointed in the script which I thought was somewhat contrived and one dimensional. It was almost as though it was written just to take advantage of the 007 franchise without a whole lot of thought to the plot.",1397520000,,441,4.594936708860759

5030708,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig brings charm and grittiness to this role while Javier Bardem makes for an unforgettable villain.

5030723,4,B006X040NY,Like most Bond movies this one has many action packed scenes.  Appropriate for teens and adults.  I would not consider it appropriate for young children.  Does not have much humor in it like some of the first Bond movies had.,1397347200,,225,4.575
5030724,4,B006X040NY,"The producers were following the typical Bond formula. For each new Bond actor they would make the first movie really good, then the follow up films would get progressively worse until they would reboot with a new Bond. However, Skyfall is not only better than Quantum of Solace (not hard to do), it gives Casino Royale a run for its money.",1397347200,,340,4.590163934426229

5030728,3,B006X040NY,"As a big fan of the early James Bond, I have tried to continue to enjoy the series of movies that followed the Sean Connery reign as Bond. These latter day movies with actors other than Connery (exception, Roger Moore) are just not satisfying to the older Bond fan. Judi Dench makes a very good ""M"" and Daniel Craig is almost believable as Bond. The story line is engaging. Waste your time on it if you cannot find any other movie that jumps out at you (to watch).",1397260800,,464,4.284090909090909
5030729,5,B006X040NY,The video quality of this movie streaming from Amazon Instant Video looked great. Appeared almost blu-ray quality. I did not watch the entire movie because I was testing the ability of a new Sony blu-ray player that I just purchased.,1397260800,,233,4.85
5030730,5,B006X040NY,Another of the fabulous James Bond movies. Daniel Craig brings a depth to the character that has been missing since the Sean Connery days.,1397174400,,138,4.791666666666667
5030731,5,B006X040NY,"I grew up in the 70's and had to watch the Bond movies because my dad liked them so we had to watch what he watched.  Plus I had four brothers and they liked the bond crap too.  As a young girl, I thought the movies were lame but I loved Sean Connery.  Connery at least made them somewhat watchable.  Let's face it, there wasn't much to watch in the 70's and early 80's. I'd rather watch the Bond movies instead of watching Tom Selleck cavorting around on an island.  (BTW, someone needs to tell Tom Selleck to get rid of that hideous 70's porn mustache and who watches Blue Bloods and why is it still on!?)  I have to say that Roger Moore was the worst bond.  I know he's a nice guy but he was just awful and not believable.  I started getting more interested when Timothy Dalton starred and he was definitely better than Roger Moore.  These movies took a turn for the better when they starred Pierce Brosnan.  I thought he did a great job and I actually started liking these movies.  When I heard that Pierce was no longer playing Bond and replacing him with Craig, I was thrilled because we had just watched him in Defiance and I knew Craig would be taking Bond into the 21st Century with an edge and he's really HOT!!!  Plus my teenage son and daughter also love Daniel Craig.  His first Bond did not disappoint.  As we all know the second was horrible because of the crappy script and storyline.  They redeemed themselves with Skyfall!  Absolutely brilliant from start to finish.  I don't want to give anything away but there are some surprises.  Javier Bardem was fantastic!  Highly recommend this movie and I am looking forward to the next Bond.",1397174400,,1652,4.410596026490066

5030740,3,B006X040NY,A 007 movie without babes in bikinis?  What's with that?  Outside of the train scene its just standard shoot em up scenes.  007 films are known for their creative action scenes.  Not enough of it in this one.,1397088000,,208,4.394736842105263
5030741,2,B006X040NY,"The only redeeming quality to this movie is the fact that it is a James Bond flick. But even then, an aging Bond is simply depressing. The plot was unremarkable and hard to follow and the camera work was dark. The best part of the movie is the theme song by Adele.",1397088000,,264,4.096153846153846

Not a bad film if you like things to go 'boom', and the cameo appearance of the Aston-Martin was a nice touch.",1397088000,,353,4.9

 I'm old enough to say this now because  I actually went to the state theater on Saturday's for the 50-cent 007 double feature..
 Craig does a much.better portrayal of Bond than anyone else ever . Sean Connery was great for his time but that was a long , long time ago.

5030754,4,B006X040NY,"This movie is a return to the flawed, vulnerable, Bond and more compelling villains of earlier films such as Dr. No and From Russia with Love.  For all their charms, I find it difficult to imagine the perfectly-pressed Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan in this movie.  Some have said it is the best Bond movie ever.  I cannot agree, because the last third is unnecessarily long, and is predicated on a key decision by Bond that made no logical sense to me within the context of the plot, but made all kinds of sense in terms of where the director and producers clearly wanted to go.  So that felt a bit artificial, instead of organic.

Still, overall, it is a very entertaining movie and although perhaps not the best Bond movie, I would include it in the pantheon of the great Bond films:  From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Dr. No, Casino Royale, and Thunderball.",1396915200,,861,4.558441558441558

Things happen, lots of action, events lack continuity, and there are surprises, but suspense does not build the way it might and we are not led to develop much empathy for the characters because of the overall superficiality.  A kind of mindless distraction if you are having trouble sleeping.  Good special effects that is exciting at times.",1396656000,,431,5.028169014084507

At this point, comparing Daniel Craig to Sean Connery is like comparing Sean Connery to Timothy Dalton.  Which is to say, such a comparison would be tantamount to an insult.

Though I very much enjoyed this latest production of the long-lived franchise...I am no fan of the smoking Bond girl.

5030784,5,B006X040NY,"Love these new Daniel Craig Bond films!

Skyfall ups the ante and notches up the excitement, action, emotion and suspense as Bond battles not only a new villain, but himself; his age and injuries have caused him to become a bit of an antique in the espionage world. Agents don't live as long as Bond has, and if any other agent in the field had gone through what he has but didn't accomplish as much, you get the idea that they'd be gone/forced into retirement. But not Bond.  He battles back from retirement (presumed dead) only to face his greatest foe yet.

The dvd version here has basic special features, so don't expect any bells and whistles. Unfortunately, mostly blu-ray & special edition dvds have all the special features you'd want to see. However, this movie in and of itself is fantastic, so I'm okay with owning a bare bones version.

Looking forward to where they go from here with this Bond series!",1396483200,,915,4.595092024539877

Moves a bit away from the save the world get the girl style that previous versions of this franchise have been.  If you like Daniel Craig as James Bond this will be your favorite.  Also has one of the best Bond Villains to date played by Javier Bardem.",1396483200,,361,4.202898550724638

I didn't really like thinking about Bond getting old as part of this storyline but I suppose it was time. At least this story is somewhat believeable compared to most of the other Bond movies. For instance - I never understood how the 'bad guys' could have an island or some other ridiculous hideout, have hundreds of minions on the payroll and still try to rule/destroy the world or some other silly thing. If I had all of the resources they had, I'd do something legitimate and live life happily on my island ;-) This movie storyline was given some thought. It's worth your time to watch.

I can't tell you how many movies I see that get muddled with overwritten dialogue and overblown scenes that only confuse the story, leaving me lost at sea. Skyfall plays out smooth and lures you in, never to a point where you say, ""What the hell is going on.""  or ""Who is this guy now?."" I think some filmmakers feel they need to stuff in thousands of twists and characters to make a good film, they don't. Simple is sometimes better and I'm excited Sam Mendes signed on for another as director.

All you have to do is suspend belief in the everyday normal humdrum of life, cozy up in your favorite comfortable chair with a cold soda and a dish overflowing with hot buttered popcorn and enjoy.  I really identified more with this Bond, as we are both getting older and need to slow down a little and diversify our hobbies.  I can't wait to see what he encounters next.  The only sad part of the movie was when M left from this world to travel to the next.  Some say this franchise is getting old.  I say that old mellows the soul and also gives Bond time to brush up on and create new tricks of the trade.  New life can always be instilled into a slightly tired franchise.

For the Bond purist you need to realize they are re-doing the franchise, new 'M', new Moneypenny, new 'Q' and a new look wrapped around Daniel Craig. I loved Dame Judi Dench as 'M' but the reality is that she is 80 yro and it is time for the series to find the actors that will move the bond movies forward for the next 5 or 10 years. I think they sent her off grandly, brought in a new 'M' and Moneypenny with acceptable story lines of how they got their positions. The new 'Q' was nicely done with a few digs at some of the 'toys' used in past movies. If you've seen every of Bond movie and not seen this one it is a must. If you saw and liked it the first time then it'll be enjoyable to watch again. If you can't see anyone as 'Bond"" accept Sir Connery then you might want to pass.",1396051200,,1019,4.024630541871921

5030847,3,B006X040NY,The movie was OK. Not the best 007 not the worst. Some movies I will watch a second time. Not this one.,1395705600,,103,3.727272727272727
5030848,4,B006X040NY,The last several Bond films have been disappointing in that Craig doesn't have much of a smile and they are darker than the original series.,1395705600,,140,4.64
5030849,4,B006X040NY,"The opening credits are gorgeous! The song skyfall by Adele is undoubtedly the jewel.

The story is exciting with twists and turns; picture unbelievably beautiful(London, Shanghai, Macau, Scotland); Daniel Craig is 007 from head to toe; M and Q are both credible and impressive characters.

5030851,3,B006X040NY,"James has become a bit of a thug. The movie is basically entertaining, but Mr. Bond is not anyone to look up to any more. However, he never really was. The new clothes have merely exposed the nasty edge beneath.",1395705600,,211,4.3
5030852,5,B006X040NY,It was the best James Bond movie I have seen so far and that goes back to From Russia With Love.,1395705600,,96,3.619047619047619

5030854,5,B006X040NY,"It's got that relentless Casino Royal vibe that was missing from Quantum of Solace. It's fun, violent, and humorous. What more could you ask for? Giant lizards? Well, it's got some of them too. If you're unsure and that's why you're reading this review, just rent it already. It's a great film and a good way to spend 2 hours.",1395705600,,326,4.45
5030855,5,B006X040NY,classic bond action!  explosions and nonstop action start to finish.  the sex scenes kept to a minimum allowing my older son to watch with me.,1395705600,,142,4.64

Same formula as old but brought up to date.",1395705600,,119,4.714285714285714
5030860,2,B006X040NY,This latest incarnation of James Bond continues to disappoint me. It is because I am old and will always see Sean Connery as Bond. Probably no pleasing me but younger viewers may like it.,1395705600,,187,4.529411764705882

5030865,3,B006X040NY,"To be honest, I don't think it's up to par with Casino Royale but I liked it better than Q of S.  My reason for 3 stars is because I don't remember the description informing me it's widescreen.  I hate widescreen.",1395619200,,213,4.170731707317073

5030870,3,B006X040NY,"Not as great as I anticipated. I saw it in the theater and just recently rented it through Amazon Prime.
It's a good movie... not up to BOND standards in my opinion.",1395532800,,165,4.1875
5030871,5,B006X040NY,It's a really good movie if you like James Bond movies or good action movies too.  It's a great film for it being based in London.,1395446400,,130,4.0
5030872,5,B006X040NY,Absolutely the best James Bond movie of ALL time!  The opening scene is just fantastic!!  Daniel Craig is the first person to take us back to the original look and feel of Sean Connery with a modern twist!,1395446400,,205,4.368421052631579
5030873,5,B006X040NY,Daniel Craig makes a great Bond .  He plays Bond the way Bond should be played. As good as Sean Connery,1395446400,,103,3.9047619047619047
5030874,1,B006X040NY,"Fortunately, I just saw this movie. Fortunately, I saw it at home where I could do other things while it played. Fortunately, I didn't pay to see it; I checked it out from the library.
Most Bond movies have Bond on a mission or missions assisted or engaged by beautiful babes, one way or another. The game between the producer and audience is do something ephemeral, spectacular and exciting and lead the audience to a nonsensical, impossible, exhausting conclusion: Spycraft be damned; it is pure entertainment pumped up by special effects.
But a lot of Skyfall is dull and dead. I don't want to see a babe shave James Bond's beard. I want quips, hormones and hands preceding body-on-body action! The audience has seen James Bond be tested and be rectified to 00 status, albeit with other actors: Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery. At the end of Sean's retesting is a fight with a very large enemy whom Sean disables with a beaker of his own urine before killing the beast. That fight scene is obviously memorable. In Skyfall the retesting is straight, as though the producers were making James Bond into a Shakespearean hero, Henry V facing death.
Bond will never be more than a fake, fantasy character doing incredible, indescribable feats. Keep James Bond attached to that box office.
The story of Skyfall involves an equally incredible fantastic bad guy, a former MI-6 agent (mid-fifties) who's mastered computers, hacking, electrical engineering and software programming and all other sorts of technical expertise. He manages to evade customs, passport, police and security agencies much better than Matt Damon did as Jason Bourne. The Skyfall bad guy attacks the Houses of Parliament (where parliamentary investigation is being held?) and causes destruction of part of the London underground.
After this destruction I can only surmise the British were asking themselves - what are we going to do? Let's have a cup of tea. Bond figures out ""We have to get ahead of this guy."" (I've heard that statement on many American TV crime shows). Apparently, Bond is the only bloke in Britain who thinks so. He devises a plan and the rest of the country follows it: No ambush; no weapons. Be sitting ducks.
My advice to James Bond, Don't play it straight.",1395446400,4,2249,4.905511811023622
5030875,4,B006X040NY,Good movie but drag at the end; started as regular Bond movie but became very typical family sentimental movie at the end.,1395446400,,122,4.590909090909091
5030876,5,B006X040NY,"I was never a big James Bond fan growing up, though the exposure I did have informed me that Sean Connery was the quintessential 007 and no other actor even came close, in my estimation. But along come Daniel Craig and he not only equals (even bests, perhaps? Sean Connery?) but goes and makes a Bond fan out of me.",1395446400,,315,4.266666666666667
5030877,5,B006X040NY,"One of best Bond movies ever,  Daniel Craig is great and does a good job of playing Bond, with all his quirks and faults.  Sound quality was also very good.",1395446400,,156,4.166666666666667
5030878,1,B006X040NY,"I know it's a ""Bond"" movie but there is too much action to have any thread of believability with me.  I know some people really go for that but I'm not one of them.  It is just another  over the top Hollywood piece of trash.  As long as people will pay their hard earned money to watch a shiny turd in HD then that is what they will get.",1395446400,2,337,3.8405797101449277
5030879,5,B006X040NY,Great Movie to watch at home. One of the best Bond films by far. To me it's on par with Casino Royale,1395446400,,101,3.6363636363636362
5030880,5,B006X040NY,"I feel in love with the Ian Flemings character, James Bond at an early age. Daniel Craig has grabbed the torch and presents it proudly in the same tradition as Sean Connery.",1395446400,,173,4.4375
5030881,5,B006X040NY,An intense action drama more so than usual and right up to the very end of this very enjoyable flick.,1395446400,,101,4.1
5030882,4,B006X040NY,Very thoughtful and intense Bond movie. It is a little dark. It will be interesting to see where the franchise goes from here.,1395360000,,126,4.521739130434782

5030885,5,B006X040NY,"I never thought there could be a Bond greater than Sean Connery but Daniel Craig is the best since Sean. Judi Dench is superb, as usual. The best Bond movie since Goldfinger~!",1395360000,,175,4.5
5030886,3,B006X040NY,A much too predictable James Bond movie - standard chase scenes; beautiful women; and insane bad guy. It was interesting to see the character changes at the end though.,1395273600,,168,4.827586206896552
5030887,5,B006X040NY,Great action film not a moment of boredom  great chase  scenes done in great Bond style will not disappoint  our family loved it for older children movie night not for younger than 13 crowd  sexual content and innuendo,1395273600,,218,4.657894736842105
5030888,1,B006X040NY,"Wow... I used to be a James Bond fan. Read all the books. Saw all the movies. Love the music. But I think this franchise has run it's course. If I had paid for this in the theater I'd be angry. It's just the same old stuff packaged differently. I almost didn't finish watching it. It appears to be some kind of ""reboot"" like Star Trek did only they aren't able to do the time travel thing. Please, just let James Bond rest in peace.",1395273600,2,432,4.094117647058823

5030900,5,B006X040NY,"This entry in the James Bond series has to be the most enjoyable one since The Sean Connery days. Though it lags a bit in the middle of the story it makes up for it in the excitement it generates, especially when the Aston Martim DB5 reappears, Daniel Craig makes a great Bond, he puts a lot into the character and it shows especially the action. Great movie even if your not a Bond fan i suggest watching it it's worth the time spent.",1395273600,,435,4.190476190476191

5030931,4,B006X040NY,It was well done and true to the 007 style and British style. I liked the way they addressed the aging 007 and linked the old school Bond to  a modern world. It was good.,1395100800,,170,3.857142857142857
5030932,4,B006X040NY,Was a very intense movie with lots of action.  Too much violence however. Would have liked a bit more humor or positive outcomes.  The movie held my attention.  Was exciting to watch and I would recommend it as long as you were tuned in to the fact that it wasn't reality,1395100800,,271,4.2745098039215685
5030933,5,B006X040NY,"By far my favorite James Bond, he has the persona down pat. Well written movie with the usual guns, trains, and cars. The villain was especially evil, and I love how they brought the story full circle.",1395100800,,201,4.45945945945946
5030934,4,B006X040NY,I have watched all 007 movies and Daniel Craig is the best Bond IMO. Also Roger Deakins deserves an Oscar for Skyfall.,1395014400,,118,4.409090909090909

5030939,3,B006X040NY,"While I love a good action adventure movie, this was just too far over the top from the onset.  I turned it off after the initial scene because it just seemed like a waste of time with no indication of story line.",1395014400,,213,4.071428571428571

5030943,5,B006X040NY,"A lot of fans were put off with the change to Daniel Craig to take over the mantle of 007...  many of those have been converted by now.  Just think if he were only a bit younger (say---as young as Sean Connery was when he took on the role) and movie production companies could still crank out sequels year after year as they did in the 60s-70s.

Looking forward to the next sequel...",1394928000,,383,4.219178082191781

5030945,4,B006X040NY,"For a series known for its creative use of hi-tech gadgets, special effects wizardry, and sultry sensuous women, this movie delivered on only the last of the 3. Still, the film is entertaining w/ its witty dialogue and raw character development of a vulnerable Bond that adds depth to a once shallow, vain womanizer. 1 final thing worth griping about is the ridiculouy suicidal choice of a final standoff by Bond all for the sake of exposing a small piece of his background.",1394928000,,474,4.72289156626506
5030946,4,B006X040NY,Cheesy but entertaining. Loved the story line about returning to simpler days and methods. Fun to watch and not very much deep thinking required,1394928000,,144,5.041666666666667

5030968,5,B006X040NY,"There have been some great Bond movies over the years and this is certainly one of the best.  I've seen them all and when they announced Daniel Craig as the new Bond, I really did not want to like him in that roll.  Boy, was I wrong.  He is so Bond, with just enough grit in his varnish to add an emotional depth that was previously only there with Timothy Dalton.  Admittedly I'm not a Dalton fan mainly because his second outing as Bond was way too gritty.

A cliff hanger action film, + a great villain, (the best bad dude since Christopher Walken in 'A View To A Kill') + Craig as Bond, + a strong emotional ending, + superb locations, + a wonderful soundtrack, + great use of lighting = one hell of a ride.",1394755200,,711,4.160583941605839

5030989,3,B006X040NY,It wasn't the best Bond movie and it's not the worst. Too long  and a little boring at times. I have seen all the Bond movies this one is not very good.,1394582400,,152,3.75

5031000,1,B006X040NY,"call me old fashioned but Bond is supposed to have cheesy one liners. bond is supposed to be charming and cordial in the face of evil.

This new bond is neither. He's a angsty self-absorbed un-likable Bond. And the villain is way too evil. Its not a charming evil.

They even skipped the gadgets.

What the hell.

Worst bond ever. Totally and completely forgettable.",1394409600,2,366,4.671875

It has gotten back to a realistic movie.  Some of the previous James Bond stunts aren't anywhere near what happens in real life.  Glad to see the James Bond in a more natural life fighting crime.,1394323200,,335,4.442622950819672

5031013,5,B006X040NY,"I wasn't sure at first. Craig portrays an imperfect Bond in the first two installments of the current 007 series. Casino Royale was a great introduction to the character, but I thought ""Quantum"" flagged a bit. Skyfall does a great job of establishing the history of Bond, James Bond. This series is infinitely better than previous Bonds.",1394323200,,337,4.9298245614035086

But the craziest part was realizing they had committed to making this whole run a prequel to Dr. No.  My mind was blown.  When they chose to do Casino Royale, I knew they were going back to the basics, but I wasn't expecting them to come full circle in terms of the time line. This cracks my top five Bond movies I believe.",1394323200,,485,4.2967032967032965
5031015,1,B006X040NY,"Skyfall seems to be the first Bond movie made specifically for critics that don't actually like James Bond movies. In a sense we've had three films of ""Bond Begins"", with each film since Casino Royale promising to return us to the Bond we know and love- and Quantum of Solace and Skyfall both failing to deliver on that. The ending scene of Skyfall hints at it just as the end of Quantum did. Fool me once, shame on you...

The plot is nothing special. It's cobbled together from elements we've seen before- a rogue ex-MI6 agent is planning revenge for a perceived slight (GoldenEye), and he happens to be a bleached blonde guy of indeterminate origin played by an award winning actor (A View To A Kill) and whose mistress leads Bond to his secret island HQ (The Man With the Golden Gun). It also bears a resemblance in style to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy- some might say too close a resemblance, but I'm not here to debate that.

The whole movie has this dull tone to it. Color is either washed out or oversaturated. There's not really any vibrance to the film. And this matches the dour, humorless tone of the plot- unless you find Javier Bardem's mincing, giggling villain to be funny, in which case more power to you. I guess he stands out because he's one of the few characters in the film with a personality. Bond certainly doesn't have one. I guess at the very least we get some of Bond's pithy one-liners back, but Craig delivers them so flatly that they feel forced- there's none of Connery's sardonic tone when he says ""Shocking. Positively shocking."", there's just flat, unenthused delivery. James Bond movies shouldn't be too dark and serious. There should be a little levity to them.

I think part of the problem with Skyfall and the Craig movies in general is that they make it look like it would totally suck to be James Bond. From Connery to Brosnan, Bond was the guy every guy wanted to be- kicking ass, driving a cool car, sleeping with beautiful women, and traveling to exciting locales. Craig's Bond just has one terrible thing happen to him, again and again. And it's not really exciting terrible, it's just like, wow, it would suck to be him. And there's no balancing with it, either- no humor, no women, even his car gets blown up. It doesn't have to be wacky, zany off-the-wall Moonraker stuff. James Bond movies should be fun, though. You should want to be James Bond at least once in the movie.

Finally, I think the Bond movies need to cut out the habit started with Quantum of hiring art house directors. Marc Forster and Sam Mendes both seem to not grasp the concept of Bond. Why not have someone like Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg do a Bond movie? At least then it might be fun and exciting instead of bleak and depressing. I don't know. Martin Campbell did GoldenEye and Casino Royale, and he seems to get it. He didn't waste our time with obsolete Freudian psychology or poorly researched depleted uranium pistol rounds.

Skyfall is slightly better than Quantum; but that's like saying stomach flu is better than hemmorhoids.",1394323200,34,3069,4.623853211009174

The main premise of the movie is even more nonsensical - that a former MI6 agent who'd been previously abandoned to captors by Dench is out for revenge (so far so good) and then plans/executes an incredibly unnecessarily complicated globe-crossing plot to kill her in return.

There is plenty of action, don't get me wrong, but the warmth of the characters is not quite there.

You never really feel happy or sorry for the good guy or the bad guy because the character is develpoed in the movie to be just an action hero, against all evil.

Seems James Bond, aka 007, ain't quite as young and as spry as he used to be. After years of chasing the bad guys and suffering one too many injuries and wounds on the job, the world's premier secret agent is beginning to feel his age.

In this outing, a noticeably creakier Bond goes in pursuit of an ex-agent who's targeting MI6 and particularly its chief, M, for wrongs he believes he's suffered at their hands.

In addition to providing a more relatable Bond - replete with autobiographical back story - and M, ""SkyFall"" is that rare action movie that actually finds time to probe some surprisingly heady themes amid all the obligatory shootouts and chase scenes (which are excellent, by the way, especially the tour de force opening scene).

For instance, the script ponders whether MI6's old-school reliance on secret agents has become a hopelessly antiquated business model for a world in which technology has begun to replace time-consuming footwork and in which the enemy is no longer out in the open but operating in the shadows.

The movie also questions M's practice of cutting loose her most loyal and valued agents (Bond included) - essentially treating them as disposable assets - when a greater goal is to be achieved through their sacrifice.

The dialogue between Daniel Craig as Bond and Judi Dench as M is some of the best in the whole Bond series, and there is a genuine connection between the two individuals who, although they're working for the same team, often seem more like adversaries than allies.

""Skyfall"" also provides us with one of the most effective villains we've come across in quite awhile, in the person of Javier Bardem as the former operative who's decided to exact his revenge on the people and the organization that he feels has done him wrong.

Director Sam Raimi even manages to achieve some genuine lyricism in his direction, something one almost never finds in an action film.

It seems to me that the Bond franchise has really upped its game since Craig hopped aboard in 2006's ""Casino Royale"" (despite the stumble of ""Quantum of Solace""). Happily, ""Skyfall"" restores that upward trajectory.",1393632000,,2147,4.876373626373627

The last couple installments with Daniel Craig are in my opinion unwatchable.  I tried twice to get through this movie and could not get more than 30 or 40 minutes in.  It is very dull and Daniel Craig makes me cringe when he is on screen.  Like watching a train wreck.,1393459200,7,381,4.25

5031102,3,B006X040NY,"The James Bond movie series is one of my favorite franchises and I've seen every movie to date.  Some are better than others, but almost all of them are entertaining and keep to the flavor of James Bond.  This Bond movie I thought was in the middle/lower ranking of bond movies, and don't get me wrong, it's still a decent movie overall and if you like Bond you should probably still see it, but one big factor killed the vibe of this movie for me.  First I want the mention the acting was as good as can be expected from the current cast, and I have high hopes for the future Bond actors.  Javier Bardem as the villain was far and away the best part of this movie, and I wish they used his character better than they had.  Daniel Craig was pretty good as a washed up type-agent, but overall came off a bit boring, although I think that has more to do with the directing than the acting.

The one thing that I hated and that lowers the movie's score was that it seemed to me the director tried way to hard to send the message that this is the end of the old bond, and beginning of the new, the Bond of the future.  The entire movie had jabs at Bond's age and how out of date he was (the quip from Q about Bond's new weaponry, M's comment about Bond's car, the fact that the main villain is a cyber-hacker and Bond has no clue about how any of that works) and felt forced and a bit awkward.  They went to great pains to set up Bond as a fossil of MI6, just to have him confront his past and pull a phoenix (basically dies and is reborn with one of the grandest Bond explosions to date) on us, and in doing so I feel they completely brushed aside the villain (who I now think they should have saved for the next movie) with a terribly disappointing ending.  Also, the Bond girl (Brnice Marlohe) was barely in the movie, she was barely connected to the bad guy, she had almost no interaction with Bond which made the inevitable sex scene together confusing and deliberately out of place, and there's really no reason to care about her problems at all.  Overall, the story ended up feeling like a monotonous confront your past story instead of a super spy vs interesting eccentric villain that Bond is known for.  On the bright side they got it out of the way and I hope they focus on getting back to telling more compelling stories.",1393372800,,2329,4.222972972972973

5031104,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig solidifies himself as an exceptional Bond. Althought Casino Royale will remain my favorite, this is an amazing movie! The storyline is very good and the action is even better. The cast is exceptional as well as the soundtrack!",1393372800,,239,5.0
5031105,4,B006X040NY,"Overall I liked the movie. It broke away from the typical ending where James makes out with the girl of the moment. It was devoid of techno gadgets, for the most part, that are a big part of Bond movies.
This Bond was definitely less...good, than in the past. his own inner issues. He pretty much just watched the sniper shoot the people in the building across the street...not trying to prevent it. hmmm.
Overall an entertaining movie, with a different feel from previous 007 movies.",1393372800,,484,4.6395348837209305

5031107,5,B006X040NY,Skyfall is what Bond should be. Love this movie. I hope they never take the Bond character back to what they did in the 70's.,1393372800,,125,4.04

5031109,4,B006X040NY,"The new Bond series is more about Hollywood special effects rather than fineness and cunning of the old Bond.  If you like lots of explosions, car chase's, and thousands of bullets fired at the hero by incredibility poor marksmen this movie will not disappoint.
I am not saying this is not a good movie it will hold your interest but it is not up to the level of previous Bond flicks.

Skyfall went above and beyond the former movies, and for the first time offered a transition into future adventures.

There seems to be two types of action movies; those in which the lead is almost invincible with perfect shooting ability and the karate skills of a dojo master; although you see this person engaging in very little training. Then there's the Bond/Bourne type of hero that's well-trained and far from invincible as he just barely escapes the end of the movie with his life. I tend to like the latter, and Bond didn't disappoint. Most of the characters are well-played and engaging and the movie never really slows down. Even in the parts where there isn't any action taking place, the dialogue is sharp so I never felt myself getting bored or losing interest. Great movie overall.",1392681600,,855,4.594771241830065

5031201,4,B006X040NY,I think so- very interesting mix of the 'old and new'. Craig's take on Bond in this one is less womanizer and far more human. Particularly his connection to M. Storyline played out much better than previous Bond movies.,1392681600,,219,4.641025641025641

I didn't think anyone would pass Connery as Bond, but Craig has surpassed him for me. Quantum of Solace was kind of iffy, but Casino Royal and Skyfall were Bond at his best.

With Skyfall, the series has begun its return to the hokey Pierce Brosnan days when the entire series seemed more like a caricature of itself than anything else.

The script mirrors this is ever so tiring event. Especially sad in entertainment when it is suppose to be escapist fun and not a advertisement for some political agenda.  Almost as bad as going to a concert for your favorite musician and he uses it as a format to preach to you about his political beliefs and not sing his hit songs.

James Bond is a drinking, smoking, gambling, womanizing spy who just happens to kill for a living. Period.

That is the James' Bond that I loved. The one you would expect from a James' Bond film of old. Now there is some hidden, and not so hidden political message that takes away from the character. He is James' Bond for God's sake; not some sensitive, cuddling hairstylist who likes to bake apples pies. Maybe a little overboard, but it paints a picture nonetheless. Give us back the old Bond. And stop with the opinionated political messages that have nothing to do with the film. Also stop casting certain people as it appears politically correct.  This has worn thin a long time ago on a great franchise such as Bond.",1392422400,,1188,4.61611374407583

Befitting a government assassin, Daniel Craigs Bond has always had a cold-bloodedness about him, but this time hes more nuanced, more vulnerable, more human.

The ending is cheesy, short of comic. It could stand in for a tolerable Home Alone IV, as others have said. The concepts for scenes and plotlines are lifted left and right -and thinly rewritten- from other spy/action genre movies, ranging from Bourne Supremecy to Dark Knight. There are some quality Bond-genre scenes: the original chase scene; the presentation of Bardem's female assistant in Monaco. But on the whole, a movie that feels thrown together from plot lines of independently successful but unrelated spy and action movies, with little authentic reverence for the specific tone of the Bond series, and little holding the movie together along the length of its plot line. Many of the actors themselves are quite good in it, but they are written into absurd scenarios that don't rise to the level of the series.

Daniel Craig was great as tough-guy Bond, and Javier Bardem was great as Silva. I love that the film went back to James Bond's childhood home- it was cool to see where he grew up. The movie featured very vibrant colors and lights and stunning special effects.

5031240,5,B006X040NY,"Skyfall is not your father's--or grandfather's--James Bond movie.  There's adventure and spy-jinks, but there's also pathos and grit, loss and redemption.  I'm certain others have given more in-depth reviews, so I'll just lay out the emotional side:  The title track by Adele grabs the viewer and puts into the correct frame of mind to observe James Bond's journey out of what he might call darkness and into his future, obscured but still lit by MI6 and the gadetry of Q, albeit a young, know-it-all of one.

This is a Bond that hurts--anyone who's seen Daniel Craig's portrayals knows this--but, it here, in this installment, that we see the roots, the sinews and tendons of what drove him to become an 007, and what makes him the apex predator in that class.  Bond is brash, arrogant, and ultimately, human--and this movie shows him, warts and all.  The relationship with M as played by Dame Judy Dench has been quasi-maternal, but this shows how the characters grew in complexity with each movie, the actors imbuing them with strength and respect, sometimes grudging, for each other and the jobs they had to do.

If you don't like James Bond, you might not enjoy this movie.  But, if you relish tenacity, overcoming the long odds, and sheer bloody mindedness, well...this just might be your cup of tea.",1392163200,,1306,4.825112107623318

5031245,5,B006X040NY,I bought this as a gift for my dad but I also saw it in theaters and liked it. Although it had a different feel to it than a normal bond film it was still good. I think this film lives up to its name and I noticed they added it to amazon prime streaming so I might watch it again.,1392163200,,280,3.6065573770491803
5031246,5,B006X040NY,Very suspenseful and fast action movie which kept me on the edge of my seat.  Did not enjoy the sexual scenes which in my opinion were too graphic.,1392163200,,147,4.25

5031255,5,B006X040NY,It's hard to believe that a James Bond movie could still be surprisingly good after so many sequels but some how this one really did it. If you are an old school Bond fan then you will really appreciate the full circle in the series. That is all I will say. Watch it.,1392076800,,267,4.056603773584905
5031256,5,B006X040NY,Love all three of Craig's Bond efforts.  He has an organic edge married to intelligence and a sharp wit plus the chicks dig 'em.  Skyfall reveals a well crafted story and one of the best Bond soundtracks ever.  A great couple hours of reality escape.,1392076800,,250,4.511111111111111

I went to the movies with a friend and my dad back in the 60's to see ""Gold finger"".  We had such a great time watching the movie and seeing the super car.

5031261,3,B006X040NY,"This is a thrilling Bond film, but the necessary suspension of disbelief is really too darn high. In the Roger Moore days, 007 was as much fantasy as spy-thriller -- maybe more so. But the Daniel Craig films have taken a more grounded approach, as least as far as the genre allows. Skyfall, however has plot points and situations that really defy logic, sense, and reality for a type-A, introverted, thinking-not-feeling, detail-orientated guy like me. (If you're wondering about my Myers-Briggs score right now, you're the viewer I'm thinking of.) I won't give away the leaps of reason, so as not to spoil your ""you've got to be kidding me"" reactions if you haven't watched it yet.",1392076800,,682,4.837606837606837

Personally, I liked other actors in the role of Bond more than Daniel Craig.  I only gave it two stars because the plot seemed so thin with one improbable situation pasted to another and then another and then another.

5031265,5,B006X040NY,I never liked 007 movies but this one was excellent . They were usually jokes and not believable but this showed an older and slower man without the gimmicks of the past. I look forward to another.,1392076800,,197,4.351351351351352

5031268,4,B006X040NY,"I strongly recommend the digital copy so you can watch wherever you want.  The movie is a good addition to the James Bond series.

5031273,4,B006X040NY,More unbelievable action.  Since I already have all the other Bond movies I have to buy this one too.  I'm not sure that Daniel Craig is as good as some of the Bond's in the past.  I suppose it's an individual choice.,1391990400,,217,4.119047619047619

5031285,1,B006X040NY,"Pretty boring story line. The plot drifts from place to place and never seems to solidify anywhere. There were a lot of scenes that were uneventful and unnecessary for story development. Most of the characters dialogue always seemed to be in whispers and very contrived. I eventually grew tired of following scene after scene that never seemed to go anywhere but lost. That's when I gave up.

Bring back Bond!",1391904000,3,409,4.8428571428571425

5031287,2,B006X040NY,One of the worst James Bond movies I have seen and I have seen them all.  Daniel Craig and the writers need to be replaced and the technical gimmicks need to be brought back.,1391904000,,174,4.117647058823529
5031288,4,B006X040NY,Daniel Craig is a great 007.  In 2014 he is far more believable as Bond than anyone other than Sean the man. It requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief. But that is a hallmark of all Bond films.,1391904000,,203,4.075
5031289,3,B006X040NY,All in all this isn't a bad James Bond movie. What I found disappointing was a few changes.  They did a lot to explain Daniel Craig as the blonde Bond. Which I really liked and bought into. Sadly they used this movie to loop back to the old Bond.  Which makes the next movie disappointing from the gate.  There is one  good change here.  I'm being vage as to not give the plot away. For me this was my least favorite of the Daniel Craig Bond. The movie itself was pretty good. But the changes let me down as a Bond fan.  Their opportunity to grow the new Bond maybe lost.  In many ways it seems this one is a throwback to the history of Bond.,1391904000,,642,4.0476190476190474

5031291,5,B006X040NY,I have been a Bond fan for years and really appreciate how Daniel Craig's portrayal of 007 is true to Ian Flemming's character.  Skyfall is one of the best Bond movies yet.,1391904000,,172,4.375

5031293,4,B006X040NY,great story...great villain...Daniel Craig is the best reincarnation of Sean Connery's definitive super spy.  Judi Dench is always wonderful no matter what she does,1391904000,,164,5.833333333333333

I like Daniel Craig, saw him on SNL, pretty cool guy; but these films do not portray James Bond.  This character in the D. Craig as Bond misses the suave, in control, Bond.  This guy has this crazed, mad punch-throwing thing going that just doesn't work.  It might be a good film if they didn't try to get people who have been around for awhile, seen the originals from the first, to appreciate this as a Bond film.  It's not.  This is not James Bond, it's not of his character to be so intense and ready to pull a gun and start shooting at people and punching them a lot without some build up to the story.

007 my butt.  This is pathetic as a Bond film.  Daniel Craig as some type agent or other, fine, I guess.  But not James Bond.  This is not too good at all.  It doesn't even rate 1 Star really.",1391558400,5,922,4.112359550561798

It had the usual amount of not very plausible action but the whole interaction of Bond and M was obviously setting the stage for future bond movies.  This was not my favorite.,1391558400,,297,4.120689655172414
5031324,3,B006X040NY,"not a real Bond fanatic, liked the Sean Connery films but any actors after him haven't caught my interest, Daniel Craig seems like the best of the bunch from last 3-4 they have used. this picture seems like they were giving us new actors to replace ones that have died or just aged to much. now we have a new ""Q"" and ""M"" plus a new Miss Moneypenny and will have to just see if they can keep making decent Bond films.",1391558400,,416,4.085365853658536
5031325,5,B006X040NY,One of the best Bond movies of all time. This is an intense and wonderfully exciting film that keeps you on the edge.....,1391558400,,121,4.304347826086956

5031330,4,B006X040NY,"the opening sequence is minimal CGI with actual car and motorcycle stunts.  A bit tedious at the end, but overall well worth a look.",1391558400,,132,4.5
5031331,5,B006X040NY,dont forget it is a movie about spies. bond always behind and the evyl wining till the end. but i like it a lot. will watch again.,1391558400,,130,3.8518518518518516
5031332,1,B006X040NY,Worst Bond Movie ever.  It lacked everything that makes James Bond cool.  Haver Vardeem's character was more creepy than anything else.,1391472000,3,135,5.380952380952381
5031333,4,B006X040NY,"Like most Bond movies, this one was entertaining and had a lot of action.  But, despite current-day capabilities in move-making, I will probably always prefer any of the Sean Connery Bond movies.",1391472000,,195,5.09375

5031341,3,B006X040NY,The sound had some type of interference. To hear you had to turn the volume way up and then there was a constant loud humming noise. Very annoying and ruined a great movie.,1391472000,,172,4.242424242424242
5031342,5,B006X040NY,"I've always enjoyed James Bond movies, but honestly, there are some that are little too complicated, even after multiple viewings. Skyfall is much more straight-forward, but it doesn't lose any of that Bond charm. Terrific action sequences, good acting, and a fairly streamlined plot make this one of the best spy movies out there.",1391385600,,331,5.148148148148148
5031343,4,B006X040NY,"I enjoyed the movie.  Like the previous James Bond movies, the plot was thin and the violence was entertaining.  The thing that I appreciated most is that the previous James Bonds were about my age.  Now some 40 years later the new James Bond is about my age.  This made me feel rough and tough again.",1391385600,,301,4.321428571428571

5031346,5,B006X040NY,"An entertaining movie with exotic locations and action sequences. Nothing too dramatic or poignant, but still a good story and well-acted. I really like Daniel Craig as James Bond.",1391385600,,180,5.241379310344827
5031347,4,B006X040NY,"The older Bond movies, Connery, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan et al were always somewhat tongue-in-cheek. And while they were quite entertaining the 'formula' eventually got a little old, at least in my opinion and typically the 'story lines' were at best, mediocre. Let's face it, gadgets, gals, and Bond were the movie.

The latest series though have changed all of that and now there are characters that are human, feel, think, and show emotion. Daniel Craig continues to do a better than average job as Bond, but misses the boat a bit in the debonair, worldly, sophisticated character we got used to over time.

A minor point, and while Craig indeed has an enviable physique, his clothes look too small and bursting at the seams.",1391385600,,726,4.846774193548387
5031348,4,B006X040NY,"Good action sequences, decent character development.  Overall a very good film but it seemed just a bit hollow.  Personally I think Craig's ""all business"" Bond performance edged towards robotic several times.  Bardem's villain was hammy and not even in a Bond villain good hammy way.",1391385600,,283,5.2444444444444445
5031349,5,B006X040NY,One of my new favorites.  Great mix of old and new.  Creepy villian.  Like Ralph Fienes in his role.  Like where the franchise is heading.,1391385600,,138,4.4
5031350,4,B006X040NY,I like that this movie went back to the old bond format. special are great but sometimes you need a good story to drive the movie. For us old folks who grew up on bond. ther is no school like the old school.,1391385600,,207,3.8372093023255816
5031351,5,B006X040NY,The story line was excellent . A very action packed movie. If you like action packed movies I would recommend Skyfall,1391385600,,117,4.619047619047619
5031352,4,B006X040NY,"I need to look into the Purchase of this movie, but the movie itself was another 007 movie.
I had hard time getting it to play via WiiU, but not any fault of Amazon Prime.",1391385600,,171,3.914285714285714
5031353,3,B006X040NY,Lots of special effects but a more serious storyline for a bond movie... It wasn't that good overall I thought.,1391385600,,111,4.6

5031355,4,B006X040NY,"It was and intense movie from start to finish, great actors and full of action. Definitely one for the collection!!",1391385600,,115,4.8
5031356,5,B006X040NY,Awesome from beginning to end. Stays true to the 007 theme. I can watch this movie over and over again,1391385600,,102,4.15
5031357,4,B006X040NY,Not bad for Bond.  M almost got hers. Lots of action. I love that house. Going there some day soon.,1391385600,,99,3.95
5031358,5,B006X040NY,I enjoyed the movie very much as it did have a lot of action.  I did not like the ending as it was like of sad when M died.,1391385600,,123,3.2413793103448274
5031359,5,B006X040NY,"I really liked the overall story line and the action that supported it. Unlike many past Bond's, this had a much higher degree of believably.",1391299200,,141,4.68

5031361,3,B006X040NY,"This Bond movie was okay but really had nothing special in terms of excitement.
The ending was a little surprising.
Worth watching if you are a Bond fan but don't expect it to be the best Bond film.",1391299200,,198,4.2368421052631575
5031362,5,B006X040NY,"I like Daniel Craig as bond - gritty and believable.  This movie was fun from the beginning to the end - the kind of movie to watch more than once.  I enjoyed Finney's appearance and Fiennes was very nicely balanced.  Bardem may have been the most scary villain ever, although he was OTT a few times.  Adele's song was terrific.  Dench was, as per usual, effective.  Still, maybe the best revenge movie ever and as Finney said, sometimes the old ways are better.",1391299200,,462,4.506024096385542
5031363,2,B006X040NY,"Judy Dench and Daniel Craig have long outlived their roles in this movie.  There is no passion in either one of them.  The action scenes were satisfactory but the story line was weak.  The movie lighting was dim, dull, and not worthy of a Bond movie.",1391299200,,250,4.391304347826087
5031364,4,B006X040NY,Sky Fall was a great action packed movie that I really enjoyed  however some of the dialogue was hard to understand. I had to keep rewinding the scenes and finally turned closed caption on.,1391299200,,189,4.5588235294117645
5031365,4,B006X040NY,"Bond. James Bond. Good for an action movie. Not much to say. If you like Bond, you'll like this movie.",1391299200,,102,4.15
5031366,3,B006X040NY,Not the best by far. Some of the special effects were not very realistic. Especially the subway train crash which went on and on.,1391299200,,129,4.416666666666667
5031367,5,B006X040NY,Just saw this bond thriller for the second time.  With the demise of Judy Dench in the role of M the next movie with take some getting used to.  This movie has typical action and suspense we've come to expect.  I was skeptical when Daniel Craig got the part but think he's done a great job playing this iconic figure.,1391299200,,317,4.25
5031368,5,B006X040NY,"I personally think Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever ... For the way they are portraying him in the last set of Bond movies. He is hard, cold mannered, tough and yet, is able to show vulnerability, love and compassion. Making him the most realistic of all the Bonds. These movies are fast paced, well directed and have more than enough (sometimes too much, in my opinion) action. But make some popcorn and enjoy!",1391299200,,419,4.526315789473684
5031369,2,B006X040NY,"I have seen all of the Daniel Craig bond films and out of the 3 I think that this is the second worse,in my opinion Quantum of Solace is the worse however that doesn't make this one good. In my opinion the story for this movie is all over the place,javier bardem makes an uninteresting villain and towards the end of the film it just drags on,there are a few decent action sequences however that doesn't make a film..I also think that Mr Craig is the wrong person to play 007 I have enjoyed some of the other films he has been in such as Layer Cake but he doesn't have the charisma necessary to play Bond in my opinion.",1391212800,,619,4.166666666666667

5031371,3,B006X040NY,"The action scenes of course were very Bond. The story just didn't carry well in my opinion. Craig is a good James Bond but I would rate this telling alongside ""The Living Daylights"". I've seen every Bond film and all but this one at the movie theater. I hope the next effort is a better one.",1391212800,,291,4.214285714285714

Amazing opening sequence, several great moments throughout, good story and very action-packed.

5031377,4,B006X040NY,"Exciting. Best parts were 007's relationship with M. Judi Dench will be missed.

 all the usual elements from the series is here  plus, you  get to know more about Bond and what skyfall really is...  another coolness factor is that they bring Q back to the series  and ms Moneypenny as well  ..  if you never seen a Bond film..this is one that you should check out...its worth it..",1391126400,,392,4.273972602739726

However, this film was one of the best, ever!

The degree of character depth, developed on-screen, was impressive as was the overall plot.  It lagged in a few places, due to excessive pyrotechnics, but those short pauses were hardly noticed.

It did not rely on super-duper tricky wristwatches or tongue-in-cheek walking away from a nuclear blast as some have come too close to.

I would have enjoyed learning more about the enmity between M and the villain . . . especially because of who he was . . . but was given more than enough to understand and enjoy.

I think the Bond movies starring Craig are as good or better. The stories follow the books closer (allowing for differences in how you tell a story on the screen versus in a book). In addition, the new versions catch the dark side of the character and his lifestyle much better which I like.

Also, the opening sequence in which James appears to die is also unusual.  The only negative is that this movie is hard to follow at times.  The plot line is too complicated and jumps around a lot.

Somehow Agent 007 finds that his feelings of allegiance overcome his apparent betrayal by M in the decision to catch a bad guy and allowing him to go back on active duty when he isn't really fit for the job.  Along the way he finds a way to defeat another maniacal enemy who threatens the existence of the British MI6 service.  There's plenty of high energy action, but little romance with another Bond girl in this rendition.  Perhaps that part of the Bond image will return in the next movie.  Skyfall shows more vulnerabilities in Bond and MI6 and the villain almost wins even though MI6 leader, M, dies at the end. I guess it's time for some fresh faces.",1390867200,,761,4.4855072463768115

But, and I know that I might be in the minority here, I didn't and don't see the need for ""reinventing"" and modernizing Bond traditions. That, after all, is what makes Bond such a classic and has given it such longevity as a franchise. Mendes does a great job delivering a thrill-ride of a film, but you don't have to deconstruct or tear down an icon to keep it relevant and here, there seems to be too much emphasis on literally destroying the elements of the series' past.

It's the same old Craig as Bond isn't ready yet. He's got things to work out which is good for development. But, another prequel 3 movies in?

Javier Bardem as the bad guy had so much promise. Instead, he's a Christopher Walken from A View To A Kill ripoff.

I give it 2 stars cause visually the first half is appealing. Then the last hour drops the ball. They go to Bond's childhood home, bland countryside and the end is fighting in a cottage...Zzz.

5031529,5,B006X040NY,"First off, I am a huge Daniel Craig as Bond fan. He is the perfect modern Bond while retaining a lot of the classic traits. Though Sean Connery is the quintessential Bond, he is too smooth (and with the old writing) a bit cheesy for  present day. In Skyfall, Craig nailed the mix of bravado and tortured soul that a modern day larger than life action hero should have.

Second (or are we on three?), the directing is fantastic making Skyfall a visual feast. Add to that, the cast all played their roles beautifully - wrapping great acting and Bond cheekiness into each performance (love the modernized Q and Judi Dench never disappoints). The real treat was Javier Bardem's portrayal of the villain- creepy and fierce all at the same time.

Enjoy, I have a few times!",1390176000,,767,4.583941605839416

5031539,3,B006X040NY,"They gave it a good try. Bored of the same format, they thought they would try something different, a Bond that in a sense had become an anachronism. At the same time, they did not stray too far, and paid homage to many of the earlier Bond films.

It was an attempt to transition to a new Bond for the 21st century, in a world without a Soviet Union or the typical all-powerful villan, As a movie by itself, it was good, but as part of the Bond franchise, it fell short of the mark in several ways. First, the movie was too long for the story. They spent too long lamenting over the earlier characters, leaving little time and taking away much of the interest in the new M, Q, and Eve/Money Penny. Second, no gadgets. Bond without gadgets? At least they didn't forget to include the girl.

My biggest disappointment, though, was the untapped potential. They could have explored the new characters while diving into Bond's past, and use it as a springboard to dive into the new world of Bond. Its not a difficult task, RED with Bruce Willis nailed this concept. Instead, we were left with a dry dramatic story of an anachronistic Bond thrust awkwardly into the 21st century.",1390089600,4,1173,4.4766355140186915

The plot features yet another arch-villain with incredible, yet incompetent powers, who seems to lack any objective beyond creating mayhem and killing M.  The climactic scene on the Scottish moors is well done as Bond, M and an ancient caretaker of the old Bond homestead take on twenty well-armed commandos with little more than an old shotgun and some rather dubious booby traps.

5031566,4,B006X040NY,"This was pretty good for an action movie.  The plot made sense.  The Cinematography was excellent.  Loved the scenes shot in Turkey.  Was a good experience.  But not as good as the old, old bonds.i",1389916800,,197,4.514285714285714

5031568,4,B006X040NY,A fun action movie as always from Daniel Craig. Great way to pass a couple of hours. It may be time for him to move on from 007 though.,1389916800,,135,3.689655172413793
5031569,3,B006X040NY,It is a good action drama film.. But it isn't as good as most Bond movies.  And I'm still confused if this is supposed to be an old Bond or new Bond.  Some plot elements seem to conflict.,1389916800,,187,3.8947368421052633
5031570,5,B006X040NY,True to James Bond more spy less action hero. This is a must see even if you're not a die-hard Bond fan.,1389916800,,104,3.772727272727273
5031571,2,B006X040NY,"Not very James Bond like.  The plot and the entire movie did not have the flair and crispness of a true James Bond movie.
Miss Moneypenny was a white woman.
The actor who played James Bond must have had something over the producer because he was not a good actor.
Sorry but this movie did not cut the mustard.",1389830400,,309,4.237288135593221

Good storyline. Hard to follow at times. Long enough.
Medium level of action scenes for a Bond movie but still pretty good.

5031574,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig brings a more serious tone to the newer bond movies If you like 007 movies (I have been a fan since the Sean Connery days), you will enjoy this.  Having watched other Daniel Craig movies recently, I realize that if you are a huge Daniel Craig fan, and not really a bond fan, this will leave you wanting more of him, since Bond really doesn't talk much, and any actors skills will be underutilized playing the 007 character  except in the physical department these roles require physical strength and endurance like none of the other older films",1389830400,,557,4.616161616161616

5031583,2,B006X040NY,Muddled storyline uses old 007 cliche storyline and characters. Lots of special effects to keep you from thinking  about the many unrealistic plot twists. Too many good stories with clever plot turns and exciting action sequences have been done to set the bar high enough to expose the weaknesses of this latest Bond movie. Any of the Jason Bourne adventures significantly eclipse Skyfall.,1389830400,,389,5.174603174603175
5031584,4,B006X040NY,The last 30 minutes makes up for the rest of the movie. I found the first part a bit boring.,1389830400,,92,3.65
5031585,5,B006X040NY,I love the Bond that Daniel Craig is giving us. A flawed hero is so much more interesting. Great action. A great crazy villain. And he has his own secret island hideout!  Classic.,1389830400,,179,4.424242424242424

A great James Bond movie in the broader sense of the word.",1389830400,,226,4.27906976744186
5031588,3,B006X040NY,"Casino Royale was fantastic. Unfortunately, it set a very high bar that Quantum of Solace and Skyfall could not come close to reaching.

5031592,5,B006X040NY,"While I do enjoy movies that present alternative takes on classic stories (For context, I just reviewed Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters), I also like it when series that have origins far back in film history nod to the past. I thought the story line was pretty okay for a James Bond, and it was better than the past two Daniel Craig Bond movies. The Bond in Skyfall is haunted by his past, taking a character that is often portrayed as young and cocky (regardless of actor's age) and letting him age. I really like the young, ""here's your gun, were you expecting an exploding pen?"" Q as well. As far as returns to the past, the old Aston Martin DB5 with the guns in the headlights was a nice touch, and going to Bond's childhood home in Scotland was a fantastic way to remind you that Sean Connery was the first Bond, even if subsequent incarnations have been as English as the Queen.",1389744000,,885,4.402439024390244

5031595,5,B006X040NY,I really enjoy 007 movies and Skyfall was as good as the others. If you are a James Bond fan you need to see this movie. It will not disappoint you.,1389744000,,148,3.806451612903226

5031599,5,B006X040NY,I think this was the best bond movie with Daniel Craig for certain! Javier Bardem plays the villain excellently and the twists and turns were top notch with the normal excellent action sequences!,1389744000,,195,4.9393939393939394
5031600,5,B006X040NY,This was a great movie. It had a lot of action and kept you guessing til the end. If you like Bond movies this one won't disappoint.,1389744000,,132,3.925925925925926
5031601,4,B006X040NY,As usual the 007 films are action packed and suspenseful and SKyfall lived up this expectation.  My husband usually falls to sleep during most televsion viewing but he stay interested and enjoyed the fact packed and intense action.,1389744000,,231,5.078947368421052

5031606,3,B006X040NY,I remember when 007 was funny and witty. Not so much of that in this one. This movie has a serious tone and the action scenes are spaced too far apart in my opinion.,1389657600,,165,3.8823529411764706
5031607,5,B006X040NY,"This is one great movie. Like all James Bond pics it has a lot of action and a hunky Bond.

5031618,1,B006X040NY,"I'm used to action packed films with tons of fun geeky technology in Bond films.  This one is neither.  The Bond character is older and they play up how out of shape he is.  The new Q gives no new cool gadgets.  The action is short and not very interesting.  I only made it through about half of this, so maybe it got better.

I liked all the principals, although thinking of Judy Dench as ""M"" is somewhat difficult.  Ralph Fiennes played himself.  Daniel Craig is a good Bond, not gorgeous but tough and serious.  Can't give it five stars because it just is too much of a caricature of a real movie (hard to call this acting, given all the help given in terms of gorgeous settings, great stunts and special effects, etc.) but well worth watching especially when you need escape.",1389657600,,594,4.794117647058823

5031680,4,B006X040NY,"I have always been a Bond fan, but of some of the actors who portray Bond, not so much. Daniel Craig's reprise as 007 works well, apart from Sean Connery, Craig clinches the role nicely-a man of the times. Skyfall is a darker version yet, plenty of action and pithy with character (good and bad). Recommended",1389398400,,308,4.517857142857143
5031681,5,B006X040NY,"007, my, how you have changed! Not as strong, not as confident, not as fast, but older, wiser, and for the better.

When watching Skyfall, as good a film as big blockbusters get these days, you may have noticed striking similarities between it and another film called The Dark Knight. If you did, you're right and it was no accident. Director Sam Mendes said he was inspired by The Dark Knight when making Skyfall because he loved how Nolan took a classic genre character and made a movie with both brains and brawn, a movie that commented on issues extremely relevant to our times, not just a shoot-'em-up movie. This movie, like The Dark Knight, is far more than a shoot-'em-up movie.

This movie is really a showcase for the classic struggles of old vs. new, young people vs. old people, and the value of people caught in a new age where they don't seem to fit.

Bond, older, weary, and worked seriously over by years of fighting, isn't what he used to be, both physically and mentally. He is obsolescent, and he knows it. And his boss M (yet another wonderful performance from Judi Dench), much older and beaten than even Bond, is forced to see just how behind the times she is as well when confronted by a new threat attacking her directly and the institution she has helped build over her life.

You see, M has made some very questionable decisions over her life, and one decision in particular, betraying a former agent to be left to die in a foreign land, is now really coming home to haunt her. This threat Silva (played by a fiendish Javier Bardem) knows all of M's moves, knows all the procedures, and knows best how to strike back at M and everything she holds dear.

Bond comes to M and MI6's aid after everything starts to go badly wrong. I won't go into many details because I am avoiding spoiling the movie, but one particular incident in the film highlights the central thematic conflict of old vs. new. When Silva uses a system run by a 20-something new MI6 hire named Q (the guy with all the gadgets) to cause mass destruction, Q, previously contemptuous of the older Bond whom Q views as a dinosaur, is mortified to admit that being younger doesn't mean being better. This kid Q has a lot to learn; hopefully over time he will get better.

The conflict escalates with the good guys getting beaten time and time again, Silva always a couple steps ahead of them. The leadership of MI6 even gets attacked in its own meeting. But prior to the attack, a despondent M, still strong but knowing her time will soon be up as a leader, tells a story about her dead husband and his love of poetry. She quotes Tennyson's ""Ulysses"" with passion and defiance -

""One equal temper of heroic hearts,
  Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
  To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield""

Not to yield. Bond and M are weak from time and fate, but they are not going to yield. They cannot. That isn't who they are. They may not win, they may be outdated has-beens, but they will not give up the fight. That sounds like true heroism, and it sounds like real courage.

An exciting, fun movie with real things to say about people and the state of our world, Skyfall should not be missed.",1389398400,,3197,4.425894378194208
5031682,2,B006X040NY,Boring at times. Same stuff just in a different setting. If you love this type of action then you will like the movie.,1389398400,,118,4.173913043478261

5031684,3,B006X040NY,"I am a fan of 007 from childhood and the brand captured my interest to watch. I remembered earlier James Bond stories where it subdued the threat to the world or the England. In this story, it's a plot of continued action and hints of drama. What I watched was action clips for nearly two hours, and with no surprises as to foresee the ending.

Though I give it three stars, it's only because I can't assign a half star to make it 3.5. It's still a James Bond movie that follows the basic combination to success except it's too long and I fell asleep during the movie and when I woke, I was still in tune with plot development.",1389398400,,627,4.225
5031685,5,B006X040NY,"Great Bond flick.  Fun, exciting, fast paced entertainment.  Bond movies will never win an academy award, but that is never the point.  The point is to be entertained, and Sky fall delivers.",1389398400,,190,4.875
5031686,5,B006X040NY,I liked it.  Good blend of classic and modern Bond & action still creative. Daniel Craig is the real deal.,1389398400,,106,4.3
5031687,2,B006X040NY,"As always, the special effects are wonderful, the acting flat, and the episodic resurrection of satanic villain and emotionless Bond predictable. It is amazing that the only way these movies think they can draw a crowd is trying to top each other with ever more hyperbolic and improbable visuals when what really grabs a human audience is the portrayal of people being thoroughly human. Wouldn't it be amazing to see Bond cry or become vulnerable or loving? These stiff Rambo offshoots who never wince or fear or feel pain are wonderful symbols of our desire to escape our own pain and humanity because, in the long run, it requires ever so much effort and courage to be a good and sensitivity person than to be a mechanical superhero. But of course, that would require writers who can write and actors directed to become three dimensional, too much to ask these days.",1389398400,,868,4.754966887417218
5031688,4,B006X040NY,Skyfall was not as good as the other James Bond movies but still enjoyed it. It looks like they will be changing the characters to new people and will start over with a whole new group. I understand that all of the people are getting older but too many references to age over and over again that is not what you want in this kind od movie just action and gadgets.,1389398400,,363,4.126760563380282

5031706,3,B006X040NY,"Perhaps I am jaded, or too much in awe of the early Bond films, featuring Sean Connery.  Skyfall was well-crafted and clever, with deferential references to many early iconic Bond movies, but, as some say ""It just wasn't the same.""  There's only so much milk you can get from the same cow.  Now it's all violence and explosions and special effects.  The Connery-era films were film adaptations of ""The Master's Work"": real, honest-to-God books. The new ones are clothed in memory-triggers of previous glories.... but will never match them.  Connery is too old for reincarnation in a contemporary Bond film, but he showed his true glory as an actor in ""Red October.""  And even in a much smaller film, ""The Name of the Rose"" (2004).

5031707,3,B006X040NY,"When I first read about 007.1 in a Sequel Adnaseum News article I seriously thought that this was a publicity stunt. I couldn't believe that the producers would actually release a film in which Sean Connery wasn't even in it even though he is starting to age. Unfortunately, I was wrong, apparently, the producers released this version of Skyfall without first receiving feedback from ""average"" Skyfall nerd users. I'm sure there are film users out there who love this film but I don't believe it's right for average users who have been using Skyfall 007 products for a long time who did not need an upgrade. It's annoying to use, its features don't make a lot of sense and the user interface looks very similar to the user interface on the original 007. I'm guessing that's where the producers got the idea for 007.1 from. I think the producers need to realize that all because an film works well for 007 users, doesn't mean it's going to work well for 007.1 users. Wait, what?",1389225600,,978,4.626436781609195

5031711,5,B006X040NY,"Most people approach James Bond films with the attitude that they've seen it all before, but this is not the case with Skyfall.  The film is a triumphant return to classic Bond form (the theme song performed by Adele is the first indicator) that introduces grave circumstances, a disturbingly cunning villian and an even grittier hero.  While there are many moments of the film that seem to exist as an homage to the previous films, the movie does a very nice job of explaining such classic Bond mainstays as Q and Money Penny.  If you're a 007 fan or if you need a well-rounded movie that you can enjoy, the choice is simple...Bond...James Bond.",1389225600,,646,4.649122807017544

Great Soundtrack (Skyfall sung by Adele)
Great Acting
Great Cinematography
Great Action

Post 2000 Bond Movies generally feel cliche to me. However, this one I have to say, is the best one I've seen since the year 2000 (I don't remember the quality of bond movies before that). The cinematography as well as the acting is superb. M16, Bond and the Villain (who gives me a comedic twisted reference to the Joker in Dark Knight) are in their prime, giving spine-tingling heartfelt performances from beginning to end.

Perfect movie to watch with a group of action fanatics and harsh critics like myself, because there really is no constructive criticism to say.

Well, actually, the agent actress who is one of his lovers in the movie tends to be very cliche in those corny Bond Lines. But hey, what's a British Bond Movie without a few corny lines?

Highly Recommend!

5031722,5,B006X040NY,There hasn't been an adequate and character filling James Bond since Roger Moore and Sean Conery....until now. Daniel Craig is a fit successor in this new Bond movie. The plot and story development are suspenseful and exciting. Don't miss this one.,1389225600,,248,5.073170731707317

5031724,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig continues to be a good 007, not great, but good.

This movie goes back to his roots and frankly has one of the better story lines - it is not just 'shoot em, blow em up' type of action.

I'd recommend having it in your library.",1389225600,,240,3.9791666666666665
5031725,3,B006X040NY,The movie was good and I enjoyed the fight scenes and story between Bond and M. You really got to see how close they really were.,1389225600,,129,4.0
5031726,3,B006X040NY,A bit long. Also the home alone antics at the end did not help its cause. Ultimately an interesting way to look at character. However the realness/freshness imparted to the franchise in the first outing (casino Royal) (Bond as a hardened agent without all the gadgets) just seems a bit sad when he is struggling with psychological and physiological issues.,1389225600,,356,4.95
5031727,5,B006X040NY,"Exciting from the word GO, beautiful women, exotic locations and Hih end cars. This is a must see for any action junkies or Bond-a-holics",1389225600,,137,4.75
5031728,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig returns as a (still) aging Bond who seeks resurrection. Resurrection from what, well, that is left to your imagination. As always, Bond always intimates that he's seen it all and done it all, and lets you imagine what that means.

Judi Dench is magnificent as his boss M, who remains cool in the face of intense political pressure after a top secret list of agents falls into the wrong hands. What can be said about Javier Bardem!! What a great performance as the bad guy Silva. Sometimes his acting goes a little over the top, but in the end, he's successful in portraying an absolute psychopath. Reminded me a bit of the Mission Impossible flick with Philip Seymour Hoffman's role.

Daniel Craig is absolutely fantastic. He exudes cool toughness that gives you supreme confidence that he will get the job done, whatever it is. His humor is far from the days of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan's portrayal, but it is ok. And he more than makes up for it with the physical and mental grit and toughness that he brilliantly displays.

Great film. Great job by the entire cast. The new Q is a nice touch that I hope to see them expand upon.",1389225600,,1150,4.545893719806763

5031732,5,B006X040NY,I'm sure his sexiness and confidence alone make it such a great movie. He's soooo resilient and I can never tell the path that the movie is going to turn. Teared up with him at the end! Didn't know he had feelings!,1389225600,,214,4.119047619047619

5031741,4,B006X040NY,"The opening scenes had some great stunt work and real action scenes. The later part of the movie was a little formulaic with some good special effects. The last fifteen minutes were almost predictable and that hurt it a little for me, I used my Prime on a Samsung Smart HDTV that was registered and it didn't look like HD to me. My Sony home theater drowned out some of the dialogue with the background music. That was probably my system more than the film.",1389139200,,457,4.3882352941176475

Either way, falling asleep during a movie more than once is scary. however i did buy it and will watch it soon. But without Pierce Brosnan, it will never be truly Bond",1388966400,,295,4.103448275862069
5031810,5,B006X040NY,"I liked Casino Royale, I didn't like Quantem of Solace, so  I was a little apprehensive about this movie.  Boy was I wrong.  Great movie and Daniel Craig does an outstanding job as James Bond.",1388966400,,192,4.428571428571429
5031811,4,B006X040NY,The movie is great and the right direction for the Bond series. Hope they don't go back to the old way of blowing up the bad guys base at the end of every film it becomes too predictable. I'd recommend this movie.,1388966400,,213,4.095238095238095
5031812,5,B006X040NY,"This by far is the best Bond film to date. I have seen all of them multiply times and this is my favorite one. It has everything that a 007 movie should have. Action,women,toys,ect. It goes back to 50 years ago when the first 007 film was released.",1388966400,,248,4.1875
5031813,5,B006X040NY,"best Bond Movie ever , i have always been a Bod Fan, however i think this was the best ever !
they made it simple, cut out all the kiddish gadgets and made a movie that was awesome.",1388966400,,181,3.789473684210526

5031815,5,B006X040NY,"In this edition of the series, the action was nonstop and it kept you guessing. It also showed the deeper relationship that Bond has with ""M"" and gave us a new insight into James past. It is a great action movie to make into a movie night.",1388966400,,239,4.1063829787234045

5031817,4,B006X040NY,"This was a great movie, however not as good as some of the others. I think Daniel Craig makes an awesome James Bond and love how the writers have written 007 more human like, such as being able to get hurt. 007 in the beginning was superhero and never got hurt, but today he gets hurt and sometimes is down and out. I would watch this movie again.... not for kids due to violence.",1388966400,,380,4.148648648648648
5031818,2,B006X040NY,"In my opinion this film does not project the image of the other James Bond films, this guy lacks the charm and charisma of the earlier movies, he could easily project the image of the bad guy instead of the other way around as a matter of fact the bad guy in this movie is more charming and credible as a good person than this James Bond.",1388966400,2,338,4.059701492537314
5031819,5,B006X040NY,There is so much action in the new Bond movies and the sound tracks are as great as ever. Very entertaining.,1388966400,,108,4.190476190476191

5031823,3,B006X040NY,"More like a trip to nostalgia land than overcoming a world despot who is doing anything possible to take over the world. How do you discuss a movie without telling what is in it? So, James Bond fans this is a James Bond movie and has some nuances that other 007 movies don't have. I appreciated that there was not the sex angle exploited as in other 007 movies.",1388966400,,361,4.246376811594203

5031829,4,B006X040NY,I like that the storyline stayed on the traditional 007.  I also liked it because they played on the age thing 'Your old so your not as efficient'.  007 is street smart and I like that too.  It made me remember the other 007's and my younger years.  I have gotten to the senior age but I am not done making an impact on the world.,1388966400,,330,3.9545454545454546

5031833,3,B006X040NY,A little anti-climatic for a Bond film. One thing I did like is that he didn't sleep around with 20 characters during the movie.,1388966400,,128,4.375
5031834,4,B006X040NY,Good movie but poor picture quality and poor sound quality.  It would have been better if the movie was made in HD and blue ray format.,1388966400,,135,4.1923076923076925
5031835,4,B006X040NY,Always been a fan of the James Bond films. Lots of action. Just didn't live up to it's reputation for beautiful women. There will never be another Sean Connery.,1388966400,,160,4.551724137931035

5031840,5,B006X040NY,"I don't know when Amazon started to allow Prime members to watch videos for free, but I recently discovered this. Skyfall is one of the videos that I watched. This is a James Bond movie starring Daniel Craig as James Bond, 007. It seems that as actors age they need to replace who plays their parts in these movies. By the end of the movie you have a new M, Q and Moneypenny. I did enjoy this movie and it starts off with the usual stunts.

5031842,5,B006X040NY,the best bond movie to date hands down!! lots of action and suspenseful with the normal bond love scene lol,1388880000,,107,4.4
5031843,5,B006X040NY,This was the best 007 movie to date! It was more realistic  in the way that people feel and react to being hurt and growing older. My favorite!,1388880000,,143,4.107142857142857
5031844,4,B006X040NY,Danial Craig is looking old and Bold. Definitely worth watching especially if you're looking to get pumped up and see some good action.,1388880000,,135,4.913043478260869
5031845,3,B006X040NY,Best part of this flick is the musical homage to past Bond Films. This film is not entirely logical nor reasonable.,1388880000,,115,4.523809523809524
5031846,5,B006X040NY,"There have been many Bond films I have enjoyed with my favorite being Goldfinger, but I now have a new favorite - Skyfall!  I would have loved, however, to have had Sean Connery appear in the closing part of the movie when Bond and M arrived at Skyfall in Scotland.  Connery could have been the gamekeeper.",1388880000,,306,4.446428571428571
5031847,4,B006X040NY,Again agent 007 is magnificent . Full of suspense from the start to the end. James Bond lives for another day.,1388880000,,110,4.285714285714286
5031848,4,B006X040NY,Watched this on Amazon Prime.  Unfortunately I didn't get to finish watching the entire movie.  What I saw was very good.,1388880000,,121,4.714285714285714
5031849,2,B006X040NY,Way below standard for James Bond movie. Story is not interesting. Looks like they wanted to remove M from future movies and came up with this story.,1388880000,,149,4.555555555555555
5031850,4,B006X040NY,"Action packed Bond with the required amount of car chases, shoot outs and beautiful women.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.",1388880000,,133,5.333333333333333
5031851,4,B006X040NY,"Good, solid, Bond movie.  Great looking film.  Good dialogue.  Suspenseful movie, and fun to watch.  Definitely a good action movie.",1388880000,,132,5.45
5031852,3,B006X040NY,"Unbelievably forgettable with action and computer graphics much more important than any plot line or substance.  Someone use Daniel Craig's talent for these things.  He is far and away the best since Sean Connery, so why not use all these great actors for more than fluff?",1388880000,,272,4.891304347826087
5031853,4,B006X040NY,"Of the three Daniel Craig has starred in as Bond I liked this one best. A evil villain is out to destroy Bond and M and all of the agents in the M16. There are some good action scenes. Example... Bond chases a bad guy on roof tops of buildings both riding motorcycles. It is a darker, colder more serous Bond film than a lot of the other Bonds. Bond doesn't have all the high tech fancy gadgets in this film like some of the others but he doesn't need them. Bond shows more vulnerability in this movie than previous ones. I really liked it.",1388880000,,540,4.152380952380953
5031854,2,B006X040NY,We have all seen this movie before. Even Judi Dench offers little in her role as M that would make me want to see another of the films. The first I have seen since the 60s. I won't waste my time on another.,1388880000,,206,3.813953488372093
5031855,4,B006X040NY,Contains the usual over the top 007 stuff but the cast makes it a movie to watch.  Hope you have a big screen TV to catch the action scenes if you stream or do the DVD.,1388880000,,168,3.6666666666666665
5031856,4,B006X040NY,"I chose the rating to help with the quality of the picture, little off the words associated with the movie it look it was a little behind. I would recommend my friends watching movies on amazon. Overall 8 1/2 on a scale 1-10.",1388880000,,225,4.255813953488372
5031857,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is Bond, James Bond with all of the quirks of being human, whereas Sean Connery was Bond, James Bond the character.  Both, the epitome of ""Bond""manship. The action, stunt work, and CGI were awesome.  Full of chase scenes and big explosions kept this film in the genre we all have come to expect.  Even though there was some ""passing of the guard"", I hope Daniel Craig does a few more James Bond movies before Hollywood puts a 29 year old Bond prequel series.  It's inevitable.",1388880000,,489,4.586206896551724
5031858,4,B006X040NY,Good Bond flick. Nice to learn more about his Scottish roots and people from his past. Interesting changes for the future.,1388880000,,122,4.857142857142857
5031859,3,B006X040NY,What can I say? Another (typical) James Bond movie with all the (real world impossible!) crazy action scenes. It does have an unexpected twist near the end.,1388880000,,156,4.814814814814815
5031860,2,B006X040NY,"Was only able to view the first hour, apparently due to some buffering issue. Several retries failed to get us past the point of signal drop.  First half of the film was 5 star however.",1388880000,,185,4.285714285714286
5031861,4,B006X040NY,I found it a little slow at times but it was exciting when the action was in play.  The interaction between M and Bond is explored more fully.,1388880000,,142,4.071428571428571
5031862,5,B006X040NY,Loved the action scenes and actor stunts.  Story line kept you wondering who was loyal to who.  Looking forward to next Bond movie.,1388880000,,131,4.6521739130434785
5031863,5,B006X040NY,"We don't typically like the newer Bond movies, nothing can beat the classics. This movie was a surprise though. It has good story line, lots of action and is not too corny. We enjoyed it.",1388880000,,187,4.371428571428571

5031865,5,B006X040NY,"I enjoyed Skyfall, even though I did guess some of what would happen next from time to time.  It kept the suspense going throughout the movie.  The only thing I didn't like was the degree of killing.",1388880000,,199,4.351351351351352
5031866,5,B006X040NY,"Great movie, tons of action.  Very gritty and back to the old bond.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.",1388880000,,109,3.909090909090909
5031867,5,B006X040NY,Excellent acting and plot. It made 007 and M's characters very real. David Craig did a tremendous job with the script.,1388880000,,118,4.666666666666667
5031868,3,B006X040NY,"Despite a few adrenaline moments  and amusing references to historical Bond this was mediocre, mainly due to 2nd half boredom with an attack that dragged on.",1388880000,,157,5.038461538461538

5031870,2,B006X040NY,I just don't see this actor as James Bond.  The action was predictable and the story line was unchanged from what I have seen in the past.,1388880000,,138,4.111111111111111
5031871,3,B006X040NY,"This branch of Bond wasn't all that great.  I guess you have to watch it, just to not fall out of the loop.  I was hoping for more ""at the edge of my seat excitement"", but it never happened.",1388793600,,190,3.8461538461538463
5031872,4,B006X040NY,"Extremely exciting train chase, in which Bond is shot by his partner and presumed dead. 007 was full of action and his black costar Eve was also very good. Adele sings the title song Skyfall. This was Judi Dench's last Bond movie.",1388793600,,230,4.5
5031873,1,B006X040NY,"The plot was ho-hum, the fighting 'run-of-the-mill"", Bond looked old, and it was too long, without enough thoughtful mystery or techie knowledge.",1388793600,,145,5.636363636363637
5031874,5,B006X040NY,"Great movie. Acting wonderful especially Judy Dench. Good story, good action.  Intelligent movie for a change. Recommend you watch this one.",1388793600,,140,5.666666666666667

5031877,5,B006X040NY,Very exciting movie from beginning to end.  Had no idea it was going to be that good.  Best 007 so far.,1388793600,,103,3.857142857142857
5031878,3,B006X040NY,"I am not a big fan of Bond films or action blockbusters, so I watched this mainly for the scenes in Istanbul, and Judi Dench. The usual Bond stuff. Nothing too special. So if you like that stuff, good film. Will keep you entertained. Otherwise, OK.",1388793600,,248,4.413043478260869
5031879,4,B006X040NY,I thought it was a good movie. A decent amount of action and no cheesy love scenes. Nice job as 007.,1388793600,,100,3.8095238095238093
5031880,5,B006X040NY,"Skyfall is a one-of-a-kind Bond flick.  It showed the human side of the spy world.  However, I hated watching that beautiful old house blown up.  That was just wrong!",1388793600,,166,4.655172413793103
5031881,4,B006X040NY,"I have always enjoyed James Bond movies...if for no other reason than the chase scenes.  This version has a couple of them and overall the plot was good.  For Bond fans, it is kind of a new start to more stories....watch and you will see why.",1388793600,,242,4.239130434782608

5031893,5,B006X040NY,this one has some very unpredictable turns and takes you into the dark side of Bonds roots.  Very entertaining and action packed,1388793600,,128,4.818181818181818
5031894,3,B006X040NY,Goof movie!  Enjoyed it more than other 007. The acting was great and I would recommend that you see it.,1388793600,,104,4.2

5031898,5,B006X040NY,"I really enjoyed watching a great action movie on my new Kindle Fire HD. My son gave me the new Kindle for Christmas, and the first thing I did was watch SKYFALL. I am a big Bond fan, and have been since 1963. No one has been able to match Sean Connery yet, but most of the new ""Bonds"" are good. I will have to say that as exciting as the old Bond films were, SKYFALL had so much action going you hardly had time to blink. I enjoyed the movie, as most diehard Bond fans would, and look forward to the next movie I watch on my new Kindle Fire HD, it is great.",1388707200,,558,3.860869565217391
5031899,4,B006X040NY,"As a diehard Bond fan since I first saw ""For Your Eyes Only"" in 1981 I still have some bias against Daniel Craig.  Wilson and Broccoli intentionally put Craig into a different Bond mold.  Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, although good action films, are not really Bond films.  Skyfall however on the surface gives glimmers of a real Bond film, but there's still a long way to go.  Wilson and Broccoli's self-admitted heavy influence by the Bourne movies negatively affected the Bond franchise- not financially, but in undermining who Bond is.  This Bond character is more a robotic brute, a shell of a person, and not the cool, in control spy.  Let me get to the point.  The movie Skyfall is a really good movie, maybe even great.  I love the action, and Daniel Craig does a really good job being a Jason Bourne like character.  It's far better than Quantum of Solace.  Skyfall was worth seeing in the theaters, and is a good purchase on Blu-ray.  If I had to rate this as a Bond movie, it would be 2 stars.  It's not Craig's fault.  That blame falls on Wilson and Broccoli.  If you watch the movie as a Bond fan, you might be disappointed.  If you watch as a big action movie fan, you'll love it.",1388707200,13,1201,4.420091324200913

I also enjoyed the teamwork between the aging Bond and M with  the youth of MI 6,  Q and Eve.  With  Q, the new quartermaster with ""spots"" and  Eve with her miss allowing Bond an escape ""enjoying death"" this setup the teamwork with youth and age to save the remaining agents  from the evil former agent, Silva.

They skipped the gadgets this year which can be fun to have, but they stuck with the story and brutal combat to make up for it.  The villain was a cold, calculating, angry man bent on revenge.  It kept my interest throughout.  Probably would've been 4.5 stars, but I'm not a giant fan of Daniel Craig in this role.  Terrific actor.  Not perfect for Bond.",1388707200,,439,4.636363636363637

With the exception of maybe one or two, I could sit and watch these films at any given time. Skyfall didn't have as much action as maybe Casino Royale but the story and pacing was very well done.

He just doesn't do it for me, nor was Javier Bardem suited to his role- although the script itself is tight, the technology superb, and Dame Judi is wonderful. (I hope it was her choice to abandon the role. If not, I wonder who's running the zoo?)

Following in the tradition of the ""manly-man"" shoes of other former Bond dudes, if I were casting director, Clive Owen would have been my choice, hands down over Craig. So, it's doubtful that I'll be so desperate again.

Only one Bond movie would I consider worse than this one, that would be the one with George Lazenby?

The movie from the beginning made no sense it did not become any clearer as it went along, the graphics, the way they were, whatever, the way they blended in, they didn't, it was totally incomprehensible. The story line and dialogue were amateurish. The movie was so bad that I could not bear to watch it till it ended, gave it away. Steve Serdinsky",1388620800,,575,4.364485981308412
5032020,1,B006X040NY,"I was raised on Bond. This is not Bond. This is a heartless tribute with a flat actor. Daniel Craig is not Bond material. He is not charismatic, sexy, snarky, or manly. The two best Bonds by far were, of course, Connery and Brosnan. Connery was all man. He was the epitome of women's fantasies. Brosnan had the debonaire attitude and sexy face. Craig lacks charm. He does have beautiful eyes, but that's about it. Flat Stanley would make a better Bond. At least Roger Moore was a funny Bond.

I miss the snarky attitude. I miss the amazing gadgets and the sexist names (ie. Pussy Galore). I miss the martini ( shaken not stirred). Some comments I have heard were that they were trying to change formula and re-invent him. If your favorite soda is Coca Cola for 50 years and someone wanted you to switch to Smart Water, you'd be upset. Bond's is what he is. I have hated every movie since Casino Royale. I AM TIRED OF MEN NOT BEING MEN. I am tired of feminism infiltrating the fun parts of life. I like my men to be strong, smoldering and manly.

****spoiler***
They call him an alcoholic. I was waiting for them to send him to rehab.
Bond gets groped by another guy.
They do try to man him up more than the previous two movies, but it's not enough.
Moneypenny is no longer a white, British woman approximately 10 years older with a huge crush on Bond (with the will they? won't they teaser).
She is a 20 years younger African-American woman who has slept with him.
He is arthritic, referred to as old, out of shape, and wimpy.

All in all, I say either find us a manly man or dust off Connery or Brosnan before Bond does become a haggard old has been.

Daniel Craig is excellent at being Bond, and ""Skyfall' is his best Bond movie out of the ones he's done.  This one is especially great because it has Javier Bardem playing the villian with a wicked sense of humour, and Judy Dench playing her usual as Bond's boss, and she dies in this movie.  The chases are action thrilled, and scenery is great.",1388448000,,468,4.395348837209302

5032067,5,B006X040NY,Great script and excellent performances elevate this latest Bond movie. The action sequences were memorable and Javier Bardem's villain had depths that are usually missing from the typical 'Dr. Evil' baddie in the other 007 films.,1388448000,,230,5.416666666666667

5032082,4,B006X040NY,"I am not a Daniel Craig fan at all, but he was better here than in his 2 previous Bond efforts.  The thing about all the actors who have played 007 is that none were so awful that the franchise folded.  Each one has kept the momentum ( and box office ) going - so I can give that same respect to Craig, but still he is the least effective Bond of all, in my opinion.  The Skyfall plot involved the revenge of a former agent, which was the case in GoldenEye.  The Skyfall plot also involved a missing list of agents, which was the case in the first ""Mission Impossible"" movie.  So in this respect, Skyfall, offered major plot elements that have been seen before.  Hence, Skyfall offered nothing new, which we expect from Bond movies. However, the movie was very well done in every way and although I would say it was redundant, it was excellent and that is hard to do.",1388361600,,867,4.2560975609756095

5032085,3,B006X040NY,This was a more cerebral less action packed Bond movie.  It relies on story and plot rather than chases and pyrotechnics.  There is even some decent character development.,1388361600,,171,5.071428571428571
5032086,4,B006X040NY,"You might say how can it be that this person has never enjoyed or really seen a Bond movie? Well, I haven't really and I know that it is a rarity but the problem I found with some Bond pictures that I tried to watch in the past is that I couldn't get into them. My friends who are Bond fans gushed about this one when it came out in theaters and I can see why. It is engaging, not very confusing, with a mystery to solve. Perhaps I was watching the wrong '""Bonds"". Don't know, either way this is a good movie, and I intend to seek out more Bond films.",1388361600,,551,3.9285714285714284

5032098,5,B006X040NY,"For my taste, Skyfall hit all the right notes. The film offers a dynamic and complex 007, a new Q and a new M - and all actors are perfect matched for the roles. The fast and tight rhythm was there from the beginning, with suitable less frantic sequences inserted to maintain the tension where it was needed. Craig really gives life to the character - less comic book and more rhetoric.  And let's face it - this is not high art. It's low art, but really, really good low art. I savored every moment, right down to saying goodbye to dear Judy. Great cast, great direction and production design, and a terrific film that extends and gives new life to the 007 franchise.

5032100,4,B006X040NY,"All the elements of a good ""Bond"" adventure were there from the evil genus, through the gadgets to the personal interplay between the characters.  The effort to create a transition from former to younger characters payed off and added to the humor than is a necessary accompaniment for massive explosions and destructive chases.  It was well done and fun to watch.  The pace was quick.  As with many current films, the fight scenes were too and too long for me and the firepower a little over the top.  (personal preference for an old dog.)  Bond remains a hero without super powers who struggles through to save the empire (and incidentally the world).",1388361600,,653,4.785714285714286

5032109,5,B006X040NY,Bond's been around for 50 years.  Saw my first one in the theatre when I was about 10.  Haven't missed one yet.  Craig's not bad.  Typical plot with lots of action and a few good twists.,1388275200,,186,4.083333333333333
5032110,2,B006X040NY,"I have been a 007 fan for years.  I own all the movies and the latest movie, Sky Fall, was a BIG, BIG disappointment.  Daniel Craig is a good actor and the rest of the cast was fine.  I saw the writing on the wall for a cast change from the beginning.  Do not know if it was the producers or writers, but come on, what happened to a good plot or story, what happened to a bit of humor or sense of fun like the old Bond movies?  Doesn't anyone have some imagination to come up with something new?

If you like a fast pace, lots of special effects, bodies everywhere, and everything crashing or blowing up, then you will probably like Sky Fall; but if you like a plot, some character development, or a bit of humor, then this is probably not your movie.  In the future, I will have to wait until the next Bond movie is old enough to be shown on TV to decide if I want to even own a copy.  Older Bond movies my husband and I watched many times, especially Sean Connery, because they were fun to watch.  I will probably never watch Sky Fall again.  Over all, it was a dark, grim and depressing movie.  I was bored with all the fast action before the first chase scene was over.  You are left to piece what story line there is as you go.  Why is the Bond character now so grim all the time?

I really feel that watching this movie was a waste of my time.  If Hollywood can't do better than this, then I will have to be happy watching only older movies.  Most of the newer ones are just not worth watching.",1388275200,12,1500,4.051020408163265

5032116,4,B006X040NY,"I love James Bond movies, and this one was a good one provided you turn off your brain.  Things really became a fantasy at the end - I don't care for the action movie cliche of the good guy not at his physical prime using improvised weaponry matching up against a large number of skilled and heavily armed bad guys - the good guy coming out with hardly a scratch is really a movie fantasy.  Also in this case, considering how easily Silva could penetrate the computer systems, I think he would have simply found out where M lived, went to her house, tormented her and killed her.  But that movie would have been boring.

So turn off your brain, enjoy the carnage and don't worry about the logical holes, it is certainly an entertaining ride.",1388275200,,741,4.426470588235294

5032121,4,B006X040NY,I liked Skyfall and would recommend it.  Definitely an interesting story line. It wasn't quite a 5 star rating for me mainly because it didn't feel right to get an image of a less than invincible Bond and then seeing the bad guy win by losing M.

The only scary thing is the possibility of this becoming a reality with how the world is becoming one big network and someone with inside knowledge could have a field day with the world. We had better be careful. But with 007 on the job who's to worry! LOL",1388275200,,425,4.132530120481928

Gone is the overly suave James Bond replaced with a tougher, more athletic, but still extremely cool persona.  The story line still pays homage to the Bond of old, so fans of the older Bond movies should appreciate it.  I'm 55 and watched this with my college aged daughters.

Adele's title song really drives home the theme, Skyfall is where we start.  As the third feature of Daniel Craig's version of Bond, it pulls details from the first two movies.  M.  Who is She?  From beginning to the end, the mystery of M provides the denouement.  Javier Bardem is also an excellent villain for Bond.  Old Dog.  New Tricks.

Major review points- The bad guy was truely creepy and really bad. Sex appeal- most sex scenes were tastefully done and were not over the top and inuendo was minimal. Gadgets-ehh, not truely happy with this aspect of the movie as there really were no gadgets and that had always been a staple of a good bond film. Also, I was a little miffed at the swipe about the gadgets by the new Q. They really need to bring the gadgets back. Story line- dark, and less humourous than past bond movies, but the ending was sort of good. Bond- not my favorite and hasn't been since he started playing bond, not a fan. Would it hurt this Bond to smile and be as flirtatious.
 On te whole this is not a Bond movie I would skip but also not a favorite. Hope they bring the gadgets back next time. Hope the review was helpful again these are just my opinion.",1388188800,,1021,4.130653266331659

5032178,4,B006X040NY,"If you only watch the opening action sequence you'll be pleased; the best of Keaton, Chan, and Bond all rolled into one.
As I had heard, this is a much more human and 3 dimensional take on Bond, although it didn't quite work as the director was obliged to slip from his unique & interesting take on Bond in ragged human form to the standby old slick Bond icon(you'll get a music cue everytime this happens).
I still enjoy the teflon Bond with his quick thinking, nimbleness, and wit, but because of time constraints it left the 3 dimensional wanting more development. Instead, you get resolution for his haunted past by the end of the film which seems way too fast.  This would have worked better if developed over the course of 2 or 3 films.
Nonetheless there are plenty of great dialogue moments, a villain worth hating, exciting fight scenes, and exotic locations.
And, as usual, women...any chance of making Bond more human by making him less of a gigolo?  That would be unique and refreshing.",1388188800,,997,4.627118644067797

Plenty of action,  a pinch or two of dry pseudo-British humor, a song by Adele, and even a retro look at the old Bond Aston Martin sports car - and, yes the plot was muddled - duh. These are intended to entertain, not make any literary sense. One real plus with this edition: the great Judi Dench, usually confined in the Bond flicks to a part no bigger than a walk on, is front and center here. She alone makes this one worth the watching, and lifts it well above most action movies.

No car chases with crazy gadgets, no cell phones that can see through walls and listen in on the bad guy's phone calls. The only thing I even somewhat enjoyed was the bad guy. Though even his motivations did not feel very Bond like. But the thing that kills me is that Daniel Craig still does not feel like an actor that is playing a good Bond.",1388102400,4,509,4.1

5032195,2,B006X040NY,"I should probably mention that not only have I seen the movies, but have read the books as well.  And I have enjoyed them all, unlike many.  Until now that is.  (Yes, even the ones with George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton.)

However, I had tried to watch this movie three times now (free to Prime members) and have fallen asleep each time.  I could not believe that a James Bond movie actually put me to sleep!  I was a little worried that I had actually (gasp!) gotten old or something.  However, I have managed to make it through several other movies and back to back episodes of television shows without doing so.  Which made me wonder just what it was about this one that failed to grab my attention.

On the surface, one thing that may have been to blame was the lack of cool gadgetry from Q branch.  Or so I thought.  I mean, how can BOND not have a laser come out of his watch?  Or a car that doubles as a submarine?  But, no.  That wasn't it.

Being a very hetero male, the bond girls have always held a special place in my... heart.  I mean who didn't hope there wasn't something in the cards for them (Jane Seymour), or wish for a little Christmas cheer any time of year (Denise Richards) and etcetera?  But, no, Brnice Marlohe and Naomie Harris... ah... upheld the tradition of the Bond girl with very little effort.

I even thought that perhaps it was Daniel Craig as 007 for a few moments.  But, the truth is, I was one of the first to applaud his portrayal in the remake of ""Casino Royale"" and enjoyed him in ""Quantum of Solace"".  Perhaps not quite to the point of ""Sean who?"" but, I did think he did a very good job in both of those.

Then I turned my attention to the fact that Bond was definitely slowing down and showing his age.  Yet, other movies involving aging hero's have tickled my fancy as I, myself, struggle with the fact that I just can't do the things I used to.  Or at least as well.  Or for as long.  So, that wasn't it either.

In the end, I can not point to any one thing that caused the movie to fall flat for me.  Perhaps it had something to do that it was the first one that doesn't seem to have any connection that I could see to any of the novels or short stories written by Ian Fleming.  I don't know.  I just know that it won't be finding it's way into my home with the other 22 movies and 14 books.  Sorry, Daniel.  But, if it's any consolation, if you make another, I will at least try to check it out.",1388102400,6,2442,4.142857142857143

5032197,4,B006X040NY,First I would Recommend this.  I have not watched this bond till skyfall. Skyfall is not your normal bond movie.  It is a little dark with a mix of intrigue.  I enjoyed it immensely.,1388102400,,182,4.294117647058823
5032198,3,B006X040NY,Too serious. I wanted more action and humor.  I have come to expect grander things of James Bond. I did like the take on him getting older and dealing with those issues. Don't get me wrong though he still can deliver.,1388102400,,217,4.2926829268292686

Mr. Craig  needs to be replaced ASAP,  and 007 franchise need a facelift  pronto.  Movie was to campy, cheesy, boring and too long. The villain was joke and stupid to boot. My advice is save your money and wait until it comes down in price  if you are collector  otherwise  just over to Prime and watch it.

Some good chase scenes, exotic women (a few) but not much else to recommend it. Daniel Craig is attractive and certainly in great shape so the ladies have something to look at. I might have been convinced give it four stars if there had been a few more wiz-bang geeky weapons but even those are in short supply.

You can actually believe that Daniel Craig's Bond gets his hands dirty. Skyfall has more of a dark and brooding atmosphere than other Bond movies. It gives background to explain Bond's character more than any other. Javier Bardem is so over the top in this movie! Ralph Finnes fits into the Bond genre better than I ever thought he would, considering some of the strange and quirky roles he's played. I don't want to give away plot, you can read that elsewhere, but the movie has more twists than a corkscrew. You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat often. I have always loved Judi Dench as 'M,' and she does not disappoint in this one. I've seen the movie 3 times, and the ending still stuns me.",1387929600,,843,4.3081761006289305

The opening sequence reminded me of the 'old days' of Bond. The 'action' seemed to drag for a while and there were some times when the story-line seemed to be trying to make up it's mind which way to go, but overall, I felt like it was worth while.  I really think it was more like three and a half stars ... but since that isn't an option, I went for four.  I liked Daniel Craig and I think they wasted Voldemort -- um, Ralph Fiennes.  Javier Bardem's character was creepy.  Not scary creepy or crazy creepy ... just like a creep, creepy.  It would have been better to make him into a raving lunatic smart guy.  I'm sure Bardem would've like that.

That said, this may be my favorite Bond movie of them all. I like Daniel Craig as Bond. He brings more reality to the emotions of a man in his job than the others. Javier Bardem as the villain was challenging and interesting without being a caricature. The return of Moneypenny and Q brings us back to Bond roots in an interesting way, similar to the full circle of the Star Wars sagas.

5032318,2,B006X040NY,"ALL of the difficult storytelling stuff was simply WISHED AWAY in this movie.

Bond gets rifle-shot off a train and falls 200 feet into a river and presumed dead. Then magically, he is alive and banging some hottie. What!?

More than alive, he comes back to MI-6 but is out of shape, hurt, emotionally damaged, quite possibly disloyal, and so IMMEDIATELY CLEARED FOR DUTY. Because, well, I guess there are no other agents in the British Secret Service?

MI-6 as an agency acts like Mr. Bean, getting schooled every 5 minutes, yet is somehow is not immediately and completely shut down or even bombed by the British military to stop them from screwing up so epically.

The supervillian's plot requires 1 million tiny details to fall into place perfectly in order to work at all. Of course, they do. LAME.

The supervillian makes an IMPOSSIBLE escape, which, like Bond's rise from the dead, is not shown because it was IMPOSSIBLE.

Bond makes not only unrealistic but super-lame decisions which only advantage the enemy, and leave you with your arms crossed glaring at the screen. Bond makes it SO hard for himself, that It would have been more believable if, when the supervillian finally showed up with his 15 mercenaries and helicopter for the final showdown, if 007 had simply walked out, given him a big wet kiss, and turned to the dark side. At least then, the audience would have been like HOLY____ WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SEE, AND WHEN ARE THEY MAKING THE SEQUEL!!!"" Instead, the audience was treated to ""007: Home Alone"" featuring Bond +2, versus 15 dudes with AK's.

Oh wait, henchmen in these movies, unless they are an actual character, just get mowed down so fast they might as well be holding a loaf of french bread, a pool noodle, a copy of Henchmen for Dummies, or a fresh seabass, instead of automatic rifles. They should have added some dialogue where the supervillian admonishes his henchmen that he is going to stop buying them expensive rifles if they aren't going to use them. Seriously there are like ten ""spin and die in place"" moves. Yawn. the script is just smoking a cigarette waiting for the one-on-one face-off and credits to roll.",1387497600,,2159,4.710875331564987

1. Almost the entire movie takes place in England, not the wonderful world scenes from many different places that add to the cost but beauty of past Bond movies.
2. There is a lack of pretty ladies and a lack of any romantic interest. Bring back the Bond girls.
3. Some of the lines spoken by Bond were hard for non British to understand.
4. Too many dark and depressing scenes.
5. A real lack of many action scenes plus lack of filming in different locations makes one conclude this was a low budget movie.",1387411200,,571,4.345794392523365
5032343,5,B006X040NY,No more campy 007!  Daniel Craig as James Bond is brilliant but Javier Bardem nearly steals the show and is worth watching the movie for.,1387411200,,137,4.48
5032344,5,B006X040NY,I'm a fan of the 007 movies. I can appreciate old James Bond films for what they are and I enjoy watching the new movies. I think this is a good Bond movie for anyone with an open mind and good attitude. I know a lot of people who complain that this Bond isn't like his predecessors but times have changed and the older versions of Bond wouldn't fill seats in the movie theater.,1387411200,,378,4.121621621621622
5032345,4,B006X040NY,"I enjoyed this movie! It was fun to watch...although some part were predictable, it was a pleasant and appropriate. Having said that the movie did have lots to surprise and keep you interested. I am glad I chose it!",1387411200,,215,4.538461538461538
5032346,4,B006X040NY,"If your into James Bond, this is a keeper. Craig is one of the more believable Bond stars and does the character right.",1387411200,,119,4.217391304347826
5032347,5,B006X040NY,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat - but what an ending. So completely unexpected and yet fitting. Can't wait for the next ""Bond"" thriller. Can't say this Bond is as good as Sean Connery's but he is a close second!",1387411200,,221,4.045454545454546
5032348,4,B006X040NY,With interesting twists and turns it takes you back to how the original James Bond started and the characters came to be.  Action was excellent and plot was easy to follow.,1387411200,,172,4.548387096774194
5032349,5,B006X040NY,Excellent story line and plenty of action.  I enjoyed it immensely. I plan to look for other similar movies as well,1387324800,,115,4.476190476190476
5032350,2,B006X040NY,really didn't enjoy this movie.  Hard to follow the story plot if there was one.  Disappointed because I usually like James Bond.,1387324800,,129,4.818181818181818
5032351,3,B006X040NY,Less than stellar 007.  Action scenes were too far over the top to be believable.  I have enjoyed past James Bond films--not this one.,1387324800,,134,4.541666666666667
5032352,4,B006X040NY,"Wildly action-packed. Not much time to rest in between chases, killings, etc. Good movie if you really don't want to think too much, which is exactly what we both needed Sat. night when we watched it.",1387324800,,200,4.583333333333333
5032353,4,B006X040NY,I miss Sean Connery but this was not bad.  Daniel Craig just doesn't match my minds eye for James Bond.,1387324800,,103,4.15
5032354,5,B006X040NY,"Since I have been a James Bond Fan since the 60's, I have always looked forward to them. In my opinion, no body was as good as Sean Connery from the beginning, but Daniel Craig is so much better than the previous people like Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and even Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig should do well in the roll for as long as these go on",1387324800,,360,4.231884057971015
5032355,5,B006X040NY,Bought all three of the latest Bonds in the same Amazon order. Shipped fast and all played well on my old blu-ray player. Will post the same review on the other two.,1387324800,,165,4.1875
5032356,4,B006X040NY,"It was an interesting movie, in that it showed 007 not to be invincible.  It had interesting plot shifts and it was a good way to get rid of the powers in charge.",1387324800,,162,3.909090909090909
5032357,4,B006X040NY,"We always enjoy James Bond, maybe nostalgia.  This one is a little different, some unexpected events and as always lots of good ol' chase scenes.  Fast paced and exciting.",1387324800,,171,4.862068965517241
5032358,5,B006X040NY,"Best of the Daniel Craig Bonds without any doubt. Personal, risque, funny with an excellent script, and just all round well thought through yarn. Can't wait to the next one.",1387324800,,173,4.8
5032359,5,B006X040NY,"The best Bond iteration in quite some time, thanks in no small part to Javier Bardem. After the disappointing Quantum of Solace, this was a masterful and needed return for the franchise.",1387324800,,186,4.84375
5032360,4,B006X040NY,"Great story line,  so sorry m had to die. Look forward to the next movie.  May be Last movie for Craig,",1387324800,,103,3.857142857142857
5032361,5,B006X040NY,Nice movie and good streaming.  I have Comcast broadband at 50Mbps.  No pauses and interruption with 802.11n.  Go for it.,1387324800,,121,4.95

5032364,5,B006X040NY,One of the best Bond movies. This movie shows the transition from the raw side to the classy Bond we grew up on.,1387238400,,112,3.9130434782608696
5032365,5,B006X040NY,"Movie was way to short,left me wanting more,  to bad that they had to kill the Aston Martin yea l know it was a mock up but it was still hard for a car guy to watch. I hope the next one is as good",1387238400,,196,3.3555555555555556
5032366,5,B006X040NY,"Great movie, lots of action, and Bond is better than ever in dangerous, fast moving, lethal roles. His relationship with M and the Service was clarified as well. All in all, it is a super movie.",1387238400,,194,4.416666666666667
5032367,4,B006X040NY,I thought this movie was one of the best James Bond flix yet.  Daniel Craig does a great job as Bond and this movie has all the action you are used to seeing in a Bond movie.,1387238400,,174,3.7027027027027026
5032368,4,B006X040NY,"Good movie, although Its hard to imagine 007 as anyone but Roger Moore.  Hated to see the old Aston Martin get blown up though, that was the classic trademark of 007.",1387238400,,166,4.354838709677419
5032369,5,B006X040NY,"Best bond movie, up there with casino royal.
Daniel Craig might be the best bond ever due to his no b.s. attitude.",1387238400,,114,4.2272727272727275
5032370,5,B006X040NY,An interesting evolution for Bond.  Great to get some insight into his childhood.  Nice to see him heading kicking and screaming into old age...hope this is not the last for Craig.  It was definitely the end for some other favorite characters.  Definitely worth watching.,1387238400,,271,5.090909090909091
5032371,4,B006X040NY,"Although Daniel Craig is looking a little careworn throughout the movie, it is a great Bond flick! Plenty of action, adventure and yes, Bond girls. All-in-all a good effort for the cast and crew.",1387238400,,195,4.764705882352941
5032372,5,B006X040NY,Bond is better than ever in Skyfall. This is the transitional movie that brings the timeline of Bond up to the Connery films and transitions many of the existing characters.,1387238400,,173,4.8
5032373,5,B006X040NY,"I liked the fact that it focused on the MI6 more this movie than in other films, although I thought the actor that played M didn't have to go the way she did.",1387238400,,158,3.8181818181818183
5032374,5,B006X040NY,I have seen this movie a couple of times and I can probably watch it a few more. Awesome movie!,1387238400,,95,3.8
5032375,4,B006X040NY,It's best to watch this movie via a blu-ray disk player which can connect to the internet.  The quality suffers when viewing through a laptop.,1387238400,,142,4.68
5032376,3,B006X040NY,"Be ready to suspend disbelief mere seconds into the movie. That is OK with me. If you want action and bad-guy vs good-guy, you will be entertained.",1387238400,,147,4.481481481481482
5032377,5,B006X040NY,"Loved the action, but I found it to be UN-believable.
Overall, I thought the movie to be a nice diversion from the wintry weather.
Loved the scenery of Shanghai, and Turkey!",1387238400,,173,4.612903225806452
5032378,5,B006X040NY,"One of the best Bond movies.  I highly recommend viewing this movie.  Worth your while.
There is only one sad part where one of the characters dies...",1387238400,,150,4.518518518518518
5032379,1,B006X040NY,This movie was no bueno. Charles Barkley advises against watching this movie. It was too long. The silver Aston Martin was cool though.,1387238400,2,135,4.913043478260869
5032380,5,B006X040NY,"This movie was great fun to watch, even on a computer screen. The sound track was outstanding! So, what's next?",1387238400,,111,4.6
5032381,5,B006X040NY,"SKYfall kept my attention, even though it was high action, and I am in my late 60's.  I certainly would recommend this to someone looking to fill a snowy Saturday afternoon!",1387238400,,173,4.580645161290323
5032382,5,B006X040NY,"I initially saw this in theaters. The only part to disappoint me was the cheesy Komodo dragon stint. Beyond that, it may have been the best movie I saw in 2012. I typically only buy the blue ray if I enjoyed the movie enough to want to see all the extra materials and commentaries. This made the cut.",1387238400,,300,4.189655172413793
5032383,5,B006X040NY,"I like all of the classic details this movie incorporates. I was not a fan of the first Daniel Craig movie with all the modern twists, but they seem to be getting back to the good stuff with this movie. Highly recommend watching this one if you haven't.",1387238400,,253,4.291666666666667
5032384,1,B006X040NY,"Ridiculous, couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. Action scenes are so over the top, it could qualify as a comedy!",1387238400,,116,4.571428571428571
5032385,4,B006X040NY,"I loved the movie but part of James Bond movies is the cool gear that 007 receives from Q. That left me wanting for more...

Daniel Craig is also one of my new favorite 007's, I still like Sean Connery more, but he did an incredible job.",1387238400,,237,4.042553191489362
5032386,5,B006X040NY,"I am a serious Ian Fleming fan. Bond films continue to get better,even a flawed Bond. He was shown to be vulnerable.",1387238400,,116,4.318181818181818

5032388,3,B006X040NY,Just not what I am used to in 007 movies.  And I can't get used to a female M.  Story line was a bit over the limit but not the worst that I have seen.  Not really bad but also not really great.  Just good.,1387238400,,206,3.511111111111111

5032390,3,B006X040NY,"Not the usual James Bond movie.
There was a morale behind the storyline of leadership, command responsiibility and loyalty.

5032392,5,B006X040NY,"Clearly 007 continues to mature along with the entire staff - the action and drama around Skyfall holds you interest through the dramatic end.

5032394,5,B006X040NY,Tons of action and it keeps you guessing through the whole movie.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Daniel Craig is excellent.,1387238400,,130,4.863636363636363
5032395,4,B006X040NY,I loved it until the video play was lost. Thanks a lot Amazon for ruining the best date I had in months. Sheesh....,1387238400,,115,4.043478260869565
5032396,4,B006X040NY,Not fabulous but not bad.  Great special effects.  Bardem was a meany.  Played it very well.  Would recommend it for action movie buffs.,1387238400,,136,4.782608695652174
5032397,5,B006X040NY,Vintage Bond!! Action and great acting from Daniel Craig and Judi Dench fill this movie. I like the transition that I see in this movie and how some characters developed over time like Q and Moneypenny.,1387238400,,202,4.638888888888889

5032399,5,B006X040NY,"This Bond movie definitely is in the top 5 of the best Bond movies.  It has the typical Bond story line, but its has a hard edge to it.  I hope Daniel Craig comes back in the next Bond movie.  Top quality actor.",1387238400,,211,3.86046511627907

5032401,4,B006X040NY,"Best Bond in a long time.  Straight forward, cleverly eschewing the high-tech gimmickry of the past in favor of the high tech gimmickry of the past (I know that doesn't sound right, but ...).  Duty and death are dealt with seriously and the action is popping.  And when the guitar kicks in with Bond theme, you'll be cheering!",1387238400,,326,4.586206896551724

5032403,2,B006X040NY,"The James Bond character has always found himself in wildly improbable plots, but this one fails for me with the wooden characters.  The film relies heavily on special effects instead of a well written story. The early movies had a charm that I didn't find in this one, and obviously couldn't use well done CGI to distract the audience.  What was with the Hannibal Lecter cage in the middle of the room scene?  I'm a little surprised they didn't have Jim Pembry's kid guarding him.",1387152000,,481,4.635294117647059

5032407,4,B006X040NY,"This was a decent movie for Daniel Craig as Bond. I think that the classic Bonds are still the best. The story line isn't as captivating as previous years. Overall, however, it is quality work, living up to the name of 007.",1387152000,,223,4.333333333333333
5032408,4,B006X040NY,"I was around when the first Bond movie came out and have seen them all. In those days the Cold War was still going on so spies were part of what was going on for real that we all knew about. Bond took spying to another level with swagger that the audiences enjoyed back then. After a while I think it was more about the actor playing Bond then the Bond character and the movies got to be any excuse for action with silly gimmicks and cute lines to try to entertain the audience. To many Bond adventure movies later the swagger with weak stories got to predictable and boring for me. Many people stopped going to see them.
Danial Craig was a new approach to Bond that I liked. He was more real but the movies still had plenty of action the audiences came to expect and see. For me Skyfall probably is the best I have seen in many years, at least the story was a little plausible with  plenty of action to entertain. As with all Bond movies the love life is suggested but left out and the language is always acceptable for the whole family.",1387152000,,1038,4.21608040201005
5032409,4,B006X040NY,"Pretty good action film, although I was more drawn to whatsisname's performance as the bad guy. Seems he has the right stuff to portray the sort of fiend we all love to hate, but in this film he managed a bit of pathos, what with the revelation of his torture and attempted suicide. There was the fact that he was given up by British intelligence for not being up to par, in a prisoner swap. Hmm.
Wonder how often THAT has happened for real......
Anyway, the franchise lives on. I haven't watched much and plan to look in on them occasionally. The special effects are always a treat and the droll humor is appreciated. The young ""Q"" is a hoot.",1387152000,,643,4.366666666666666

Of course, Mr. Daniel Craig, makes for probably the best James Bond of the long and respectable list of actors that have portrayed this ageless secret agent 007. The action scenes, like just about most 007 films, are a great visual thrill. Surely not the best of Mr. Daniel Craig Bond films, never the less it has its moments, but gradually they wear off. Javier Bardem makes for an impossibly hard villain to believe, too many moments when the movie simply veers out of the path, making him even more incredible than he is supposed to be. I can understand that it is all a make believe type secret agent versus the world's most evil enemy, but there is just so much the imagination can accept. Besides the big holes in the script, there are enough chases and action scenes to entertain the avid Bond fan.

However, in the last movie I was not happy with what I got. In this case though, I encountered a fast-paced and thrilling film, with a well-thought-out story and a fascinating cast.

I liked the twist they start the movie with. Bond ""dying"" and not leaving MI6 until an attack is carried out by a dangerous sociopath on the agency headquarters, killing a vast number of double 0s. In this process we get to see a different Bond, since he struggles with regaining his skills when getting back in action, so he is not the usual efficient killing machine. Due to the nature of the evil Bond faces, this time the action is really close to home, with M being one of the targets. This makes the film all the more thrilling.

Of course, there is plenty of action, some time with the ladies and explosions / destruction to last for days. There may be a couple of scenes that are a bit over the top, but nothing too obnoxious.

It is made to please those who are older than 30 feeling like they're out of touch with technology/reality.

The Good: Not much. It's not a good movie. It's more like a scatter shot of ideas thrown together. The new Q was Ok. I could see him as a Dr. Who somewhere down the line.

The Bad: The main bad isn't revealed until 3/4 of the way through the movie, and then he is caught instantly. He's a 'super hacker' who doesn't hack much or something. He tells a story about rats that is supposed to be deep. It isn't. The rest of the movie is him running away, then running towards. Not much else.

The Ugly: First off they try to make you feel sorry for a ""character"" who is being stalked by the main bad. It doesn't work cause that ""character"" is a horrible person and deserves to die. I felt worse for the chick who was shot and spilled the whiskey, and she was only in the movie for 10 minutes. I felt worse for the whiskey that was spilled when they shot her than I ever could for the ""character."" Bond is a walking dead in this movie. He has one forced ""love"" scene just so they could touch that base.

Waste of an actor of Bardem's quality to have so few dimensions when he could easily have done a lot more. They've made Bond a little more complex lately, but haven't done the same to the other players, particularly the antagonist.  But then, maybe the franchise loves their villains this way.

spoiler alert: it was neither camp nor actual spy drama, it was somewhere in between doing both badly. Bond is supposed to appeal across a range of audiences expecting different things. This disappointed on every level except the opening credits - at least some things are sacred - and the Adele song. If it's a more realistic Bond more like Casino Royale it fell short: it had a Moore-era villain who was unbelievable and whose entire plot made no sense (lots of plotting that had zero to do with his objective which was achievable apparently by walking into a secure meeting room in the House of Commons with just a bobby's outfit), death-defiance that couldn't happen, missed shots by great operatives in multiple scenes (flinching/pausing during opening sequence to let bad guy get away? three expert shots in one room against a single target who isn't moving?), obligatory chase through bazaar with overturned colorful carts and no injuries, ridiculously bad planning for the ""Home Alone with the Olds"" sequence (what, no extra ammo in that secret garage you stopped at on the way? really, a Scottish gamekeeper in a fight for his life takes off across the moors he knows in moonlight...but carries a flashlight so he can be tracked?), lame refs (Astin Martin, Moneypenny, really this is supposed to make me feel better?), enough ham-handed omens about people being too old for the business that you expect M to die at least three times before she actually does, etc etc etc. If a camp movie: then it missed with terrible writing and none of the actually funny puns or witty lines or Bond women worth going silly for and no gadgets.

5032499,4,B006X040NY,"A 23rd James Bond movie directed by Sam Mendes, produced by Michael G Wilson and Barbara Brocolli, starring Daniel Craig as James Bond.

A rich, high budget film, with sexy ladies, as usual with James Bond's movies, comes with a story line based upon hunting down the secret information of worldwide undercover agents of MI6 placed in different terrorist organizations across the world, which is lost by MI6, the employer of James Bond. The thief was Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), also an ex-MI6 agent, gets access to the internal server network of MI6 and tries to destroy the entire organization and kill its chief, `M' as a vengeance to an old treachery of M when he was in service. James Bond traces down Raoul in Shanghai (China) and captures him. But Raoul escapes from MI6 prison in London, by hacking into their security systems, and also attempts to kill M, in her office. Sensing danger, James escorts M to his childhood farm house ""The Skyfall"" in Scotland, deliberately leaving a trail, for Raoul to follow, so that he can kill him there. Raoul attacks Skyfall as per Bond's plan, but Bond will not be able to save M, in the battle with Raoul, though he kills the later.
The special effects, screenplay and cinematography employed in the movie are simply superb and absolutely extravagant. They are said to have used the latest technology in capturing the moments with Arri Alexa cameras. One can see how money is spent on some scenes that are mind blowing. Particularly the chase on the train, chase in the underground London tunnel, chase on the rooftops in Istanbul, Shanghai and Macau exotic locations and the splendor of Scotland's countryside where Skyfall is located are worth watching and a real value for money. . Overall, a film with no slang and truly English.
Ensure watching it in big screen with equally good sound system.
Daniel Craig, a more of a serious faced and less of a tomboy unlike previous James Bonds we have grown up with, seems to be sure of the retirement from the service and it's time to see a new James Bond, very soon.

My rating is 4.5/5",1386892800,,2081,4.698630136986301

5032510,1,B006X040NY,"Perhaps my least favorite Bond movie.  To begin with, it seems every ""spy"" or covert cliche was used to construct the so called plot of this movie.  (Spoilers)  You name it, and it happens in this movie; stolen list of covert agents by bad guys (see NOC-lists), agent death when he isn't really dead (just recovering on an island while growing a beard), and new inept agent who shouldn't be an agent is an agent on a seemingly important mission.  This was like an episode of Archer without the hilarity.  Many of our favorite things about Bond movies do not exist in Skyfall; the women have weaker roles than ever before and are not terribly interesting or beautiful; the gadgets do not exist; and with the exception of a throwback to the original Bond car near the ending, there is not a great Bond automobile.  Th cinema photography was excellent in China, which is really the movie's sole highlight.",1386806400,2,902,4.6415094339622645

I have read most of the books, and Craig is an excellent Bond.  I like the darker, colder version that he is. I guess I will watch this again, but I just really never got engaged with this one. For reference, my favorite is probably You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service is probably one of the top five worst films (let alone Bond) I have ever, ever seen.",1386720000,,533,4.105769230769231

Definitely worth seeing if you like action movies in general. All the key elements are there. There were really only two gadgets in this one. Most of it was a battle of wits.

The one thing i deducted a start for is that I wish, (spoiler alert) the demented villain Silva, had one more trick under his sleeve after he gets the knife in his back at the end. I thought that Bond's win was a little too easy.",1386720000,,502,4.164948453608248

5032527,4,B006X040NY,Good action movie got me interested in Bond movies again. I didn't think much of Daniel Craig (never saw him in any movies) before this one but he does seem to be the perfect Bond. (I loved Sean Connery in his day.),1386720000,,215,4.142857142857143
5032528,4,B006X040NY,Very suspenseful.  Only thing I had against it was it was too long to me.  I feel like they could have cut out 20 or 30 minutes and still had a wonderful movie.  Daniel Craig is a marvelous James Bond and the new actors that assume important roles at the end should keep the franchise in good stead for quite some time.,1386720000,,319,4.112903225806452

5032530,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig portrays Bond with a humanity and empathy for the world-weary and war-weary MI-6 agent that we haven't seen in other actors in the role. This Bond bleeds, and aches, and is much more atavistic. Previous Bonds have been coated with varying degrees of Teflon. This one carries the scars of his work -- both externally and internally.

This is all good. It is still PURE entertainment but at least it leaves some room for your brain to continue assessing the potential reality of the situation -- or at least the humanity of the characters given the fantastic scenarios.

Also; the set-up at the end for Ralph Fiennes to join the ensemble was well handled. Good job overall.",1386720000,,684,4.739495798319328
5032531,5,B006X040NY,"I am a huge James Bond fan and am almost embarrassed by the number of times I've watched all the movies over and over again. I know most of the dialog by heart - sad, I know, but I never get tired of watching them. All the actors who've played Bond over the years have brought their own interpretation to the character and I'm sorry to say it Sean Connery, but Daniel Craig
in my option has nudged you out of the ""best' James Bond.

I like that the plot lines have moved on and although there is still sex and bad guys, the story lines have gotten better and there is certainly a lot more action which is great.

I have been simply amazed by the James Bond movies with Daniel Craig. I'm not sure if Craig is the icing on the new story lines or what but every one of the Bond series with Craig have been great. I rarely go to the movies these days because of the cost and the hassle of the crowds but this is one movie I wished I'd seen on the big screen.  It is well crafted and a darn good movie.

I was totally engrossed through this movie, it was action filled and the story line was very good. I liked that Judi Dench had a much bigger role this time out. She's a fine actress and it was great to see her do more than be in the background and keep Bond in line.

I loved that they brought back one of the signature Bond ""toys"" and Javier Bardem (in spite of getting side tracked by his hair) is a true wacko!

There are some holes in the plot however - how the enemy can survive a cyanide pill; why a so-called cyber genius (the new Q) would connect an enemy computer to his network, and how a sharpshooter can squarely hit someone with high powered rifle and survive.  Of course the fantasy agent still prevails, despite a major building bomb, two train catastrophes and a government hearing assassination attempt.

5032563,4,B006X040NY,"We are now into the third Bond film of the Daniel Craig era, and with this entry we have two groundbreakers for the Bond franchise.  First, this is the first Bond film to delve into the titular character's childhood.  Specifically, the final climatic scene occurs in Bond's childhood home of Skyfall estate in Scotland.  Second, one of the good guys dies!  Actually, it is a good girl.  For decades, the character M was played by a woman, with Judi Dench occupying the role the past two decades starting with GoldenEye.  In this film, she dies at the end, being the first recurring protagonist to be killed of.  We also see the initiation of MoneyPenny and Q into the Bond franchise, along with M's replacement, Gareth Mallory.  In the midst of all these major events is the movie's story; a renegade MI6 agent exacts his revenge upon the agency in a multi-layered conspiracy of murder and mayhem.  Wrapped up in this are great shootouts, fistfights, car chases, and other action scenes.  My only beef with this film is its digress into the realm of super-heroic action; i.e. Bond taking not one, but two bullets, falling hundreds of feet into raging waters, yet surviving to enjoy life on a tropical beach and then cutting one of the bullets out of himself for some forensic analysis.  Rambo anyone?  Because of this, I give this film 4/5 instead of the 5/5 stars the story deserves.",1386547200,,1384,4.6970954356846475

Character development is very weak; most characters being defined only by their appearance. The fight and chase scenes are also a major let down, very poorly choreographed. There really aren't any major redeeming qualities to this movie.

I hated ""Casino Royale"" and did not like ""Quantum Of Solice"" for continuing off that mess of a movie. But ""Skyfall"" brings Bond back, the Bond we used to know and love, with some new, great elements brought to the table as well. While I do criticize a few minor flaws in the film such as Q being young as he is (Q has always been older than Bond) and the scene where he kind of lets that girl get shot by the villain (in older films, Bond always saved the girl) I have little to no more complaints about it. He begins acting more like Bond in this film again, rather than the immature crybaby he was in the last two, it brings good ol' Q and Moneypenny back, well as showing the interesting transition between the two ""M""s. The action scenes and story are both well done and the climatic battle at Bond's house is one of the greatest moments in Bond history! It was even kind of cool seeing the gun barrel sequence at the end of the film instead of the beginning, too. There were many good things I enjoyed about this film and will be adding it to my collection which consists of every single Bond film minus Daniel Craig's first two.

5032619,5,B006X040NY,"Bond still lives.  And here's why...

Casino Royale set the scene.  Underplayed, yet stellar performances from Daniel Craig and the fabulously under-emphasized Eva Green blew people away.  It set the scene perfectly for Bond; the unattached, unattainable leading man.  Able to sear an insincere suitor from a dozen paces, yet captivated by the humanity and vulnerability of a recalcitrant, love-struck, flighty heroine who had previously tried to screw him when she had the upper hand, thinking she held all the cards.  It has always been clear that Bond knew *WHERE* to walk the walk and *HOW* to walk the walk, but he was always human..... for those that deserved it.

So....  I felt Casino was a well-thought-out, perhaps even well-relished reboot of the franchise.  An opportunity for the the establishment to wad up the script, throw it over their shoulder and get down to brass tacks:  What defines Bond?  What is, in this day and age, cool?  What would he gravitate to, and what would define him, were he in a specific situation?  With a nerve of cold steel that is...

Casino delivered.  From the jaw-dropping intro sequence, through the slightly unbelievable poker game (played with pathos by all concerned, including the awesome Felix Leiter cum Jeffrey Wright (why hasn't he resurfaced yet?).

And then, we segued into Quantum, with a paper villain - a shadowy, unconvincing, undefined nobody, and a wishy-washy global cartel of navel-gazing and opera-watching dastardly wannabees.  Le Chiffre was someone who wasn't given the chance to prove his credentials... no fluffy white kitty to pet, no henchmen to discard indiscriminately... nothing to really show his uber-badness.  Quantum missed a beat here.  Bond did his job, but we were left with no over-arching sense of humanity having been saved.  All was right with world, but so what?  Was it really in danger from the beginning with some second rate assault on some cut-price resort in the desert?

And so... it was with no small amount of trepidation that I awaited the release of Skyfall.

The trailers looked suitably epic!

Javier Bardem as villain.....  *squeeeeeeeeee*  ohmigodohmigod.....seriously?!?!  If ever there was an actor who could deliver the pathos to follow Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who could it be other than Javier Bardem, or possibly John Malkovich on a really good (BAD) day, when he wasn't playing John Makovich.  I mean, the villain has to be seriously deranged... and *believably* deranged and devoid of humanity....  either that or he has to be so twisted, so screwed up and savaged by the path of his life that you can genuinely believe his choices when it comes to consigning vast swathes of humanity to the cutting-room floor.

But wait!  Skyfall does a neat trick by avoiding that very charged and polarizing battlefield. Instead of there being an implacable wall of minions, under-chiefs, sub-villainesses-cum-sub-heroines and so on and so forth, they cut to the quick and we are left with nothing other than Bond, his murky past, his boss (the fabulously enigmatic and resolute Dame Judi Dench), and the villain.  Ohhhhh, and a reappearance by *THAT* car.  Oh yes!  the DB6 is back!  *sighhhhh*.  If there ever was a Bond Girl swathed in sheet metal, the DB6 was it.  Emphatically and categorically.

Put it against the stunning backdrop of the Scottish highlands, and you have half a film in the making, just there!

But that isn't quite our climax.  We are left to grapple with a very human finale touching on human frailty, the strength of the desire for revenge, and that indefinable core thread of psychosis that leads the very strongest (on both sides) to stand up beyond the limits of human endurance for what they believe in, no matter what the consequences.  We are shown tantalizing glimpses of the Genesis of Bond - a gamekeeper that predates him, more of the resolute and yet all too human Judi Dench in an unwinnable situation that Bond gets to disregard most of the time, a shotgun with the timeless and poignant initials AB (thanks Cubby!), and a sizable dash of suitably Hollywood cinematic pyrotechnics!

I arrived at the point of sitting down to watch this film, over a year and a half after its cinematic debut, in knowing two major plot spoilers. *Both* of which, I had expected, would bias my view of, and taint my enjoyment of, this film.  I am extremely glad that this was NOT the case.  And let me make it perfectly clear why.  I feel that here are a number of all-too-human saving graces in this film which have converted me from Casino-lover and Quantum-hater, into Skyfall-Revenant and carrier-of-belief-for-that-which-comes-next:  We were given Casino Royale... with the setting.... the Hero.... the Heroine.... the poker... The Aston..... the betrayal... did we really need any more plot elements?  And that Intro Sequence and chase?  Stellar!  That was enough for one film, in the way it was delivered, as a story with historical significance (minus the awkward product placement... thank you Ford), to say ""This is the Genesis of Bond.  Let's skip Quantum....

This is more of Why.

This is more of Where.

This is more of How-He-Came-To-Be, after he was tempered in the fires of Casino Royale.  Forged in tragedy, tempered by his own strengths and the frailty of human weaknesses and temptation, we get to see how Bond flexes when stretched past the point of reasonable human response.

With all his strengths, and with all of his weaknesses and faults, there is still a pinch of humor, a sense of wanting to have fun going forward, and to tip the hat to what has been, whilst acknowledging how far the spy game has moved forward in the past 50 years.  Because, this *IS* a demi-centennial release!  Who would have thought it when Ursula Andress reared up out of the waves in all her stunning glory?  When will we have a Bond Girl to take the script, and rip it up and steal the camera in the same way she did?

So, we have less of an over-arching storyline than we did with Casino and Quantum, and  yet, to me, a far more satisfyingly human story (especially towards the end) of human protagonists in inhuman roles, with stakes way beyond what any mere mortal should have to deal with, yet which are considered normal (or even boring) by human (or Hollywood) standards.

I shall refrain from spoiling the script any further.  Suffice it to say I would highly recommend it to those that loved ""Casino"" and hated ""Quantum"", and even to those that loved both.  I especially appreciate their willingness to show the humanity of Bond, and despite ""the-reboot-franchise-to-follow-what-went-before"", an attempt to address the concept of Bond at 50, thanks to a fairly gracefully aging Daniel Craig.

This is a throwback that defies modern expectations of an overly bombastic Hollywood finale in favor of a work that tries to take into account the past (and its fans), the current protagonists, and the need for a vaguely believable plot, script and denouement.  Ugggh, but there are casualties..... especially those swathed in sheet metal.... and yes, that's casualties, plural.  I will spoil no more.

Given that I am so late to the game, this won't be news to most people.  I hope the franchise can take things onwards and upwards from here, and that they will be able to keep things fresh, and revitalize Q division following the ""departure"" of Desmond Llewellyn and the abortive appearances of John Cleese, who could have done well here.

In summary, a good recovery from Quantum, and a good starting point for Bond to begin to have an inkling of the world-wide dominance of Spectre and a modern day showdown with a suitable Blofeld replacement.

Makes me wish for Sean Connery stories and writers where the focus was more on people than action.  When the villain allows himself to be captured so that his computer could be connected to MI-6's network and Q isn't smart enough to isolate it, the story fell apart for me.  Q looks nerdy enough for that not to happen.  I guess the writers feel that you don't understand the ideas of possible viruses and their isolation.  But then when the writers come up with a  trackhoe ripping up the railroad passenger car just ahead of it, I gave up.

In Skyfall we find the world's greatest special agent relegated to the role of a fool, as in truly imbecilic.  For example, when being chased, Bond takes M to a home in Scotland where they can see the enemy coming for miles.  After an 80's-style&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MacGyver/dp/B000SQFC2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MacGyver</a>&nbsp;montage in which Bond and company booby trap the house a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Alone/dp/B00008N6NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Alone</a>, they then hang out and wait for the baddies to come.  Now there's an escape tunnel which they eventually use, and you'd think the world's smartest secret agent would use to set himself up a nice sniper nest BEFORE-hand, but you'd be wrong.  Fortunately the bad guys are every bit as stupid, pulling right up to the house then walking through it setting off trap after trap, even though they could've surveilled to their heart's content because, as mentioned, the house is on a flat and you can see for miles.  Combine that with the RAF's twice-too-late timing, some unacceptably bad firearm play, and a director addicted to crane shots and that gives you a taste of how poor this movie is.

Now there are some classically-clever Bond lines in the film; and the scene in which Bond lands on the torn-in-half train, straightens his tie, and keeps walking is iconic.  And I get that's it's Bond, not Bourne, so it can't be taken seriously.  It's just unfortunate to me that the build-up is the promising premise of two masterminds playing chess but the bulk of the movie is of two Hollywood actors making the least tactical decisions possible.",1386115200,3,1841,5.5

Casino Royale WAS my favorite recent Bond movie.  Quantum of Solace was okay, but a little slow after the nearly out of control Casino Royale.  Skyfall ups the ante and cranks the action to eleven.  The villain is great, the action is great, there's typical humorous quips throughout the movie, and you really get a little deeper glimpse into what makes Bond tick.  I don't buy movies very often.  In fact, I rented this one after seeing it in the theatres.

Moreover, the supporting cast has never been more stellar, or better. The penultimate villan is electrifyingly brewed and concocted by Javier Bardim. Judi Dench, once again, is M, to the letter.

Before I had all kind of ideas about where skyfall could come from, but not expected that it was named for a house. Browse the internet, and you can even see how it was constructed in Scottland.

I was enthralled for the entire 143 minutes. The story and dialog were masterful and the acting was superb.  Almost all of the actors were perfectly casted.

My only criticism is the casting of Javier Bardem. I would have preferred to see a different actor in that role.  Kevin Spacey was apparently offered the role and I think he would have been a better choice.

5032746,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig has turned out to be my favorite 007 so far.  But it isn't just Craig.  The Bond movies that Craig has starred in are much more hard-edged and interesting than most of the previous Bond films, which are almost cartoonish in comparison.  The Craig Bond films are much darker and more realistic in many respects than the previous ones.  That doesn't mean, of course, that there aren't plenty of outlandish stunts and and violence that go along with these new 007 incarnations.  After all, that's half the fun of watching these films.  Craig brings a certain credibility to the James Bond character, though, that has always been lacking in those previous films.  While Skyfall is not, in my opinion, as good a film as Casino Royale (my favorite Bond film of all time), it comes very, very close. It is certainly a better Bond film than Quantum of Solace, which I still liked even so. Skyfall is, like Casino Royale, one of the best Bond films yet.

If you watch a film and actually THINK about plot details then this one will bother you.  The ending really pushed the limits of believability, including the well-lit under-the-frozen-lake fight sequence which was both creepy and ridiculous, and the film just ended with a dull anticlimax.

Sam Mendes does a good job of making this movie a more sophisticated action movie rather than simply an action movie. Daniel Craig seems to be coming into the part, the overall acting is strong by everyone in the cast, and it has great cinematography.",1385683200,,339,4.573770491803279
5032750,3,B006X040NY,"I am a huge Bond fan, but this movie tries very hard to reinvent Bond once again. It only partially succeeds. I've heard critics say it is the ""best Bond movie"" but it is FAR from it. The story gets more twisted and unbelievable as it moves ahead. Bond meets an omnipotent villain who, like Heath Ledger's Joker from ""The Dark Knight"" sees all things and plans for every eventuality. The villain, played by Javier Bardem, has the foresight to plan ahead. Bombs explode on schedule, lights to go out, computers get hacked, and secret are exposed, frustrating Her Majesty's Secret Service at every turn.
I have nothing against Daniel Craig, whose Bond is perhaps the dryest yet most physical of 007 portrayals, but Bond in this chapter could use a boost of charisma. After sustaining a gunshot wound and falling off a two hundred foot bridge (!?!?!) Bond is lost, self-destructive, and apathetic. He pines away his time on some unkown tropical paradise, drinking himself into a jaded stupor. When he learns that evil is once again afoot in the world, a result of his previous failed mission to protect the indentities of  double agents, he returns as the repenent son to surrogate mother figure ""M"" (Dame Judy Dench) to renlist in the Service of his country and protect her from an old grudge.
This time Bond's leave of absence has left its mark. Bond can't do anything right. He can't win a fist fight with a common thug, can't shoot straight, can't do chin ups, and can't seduce a woman (a former child sex slave, to boot, what the !?!??!$%#?!! were the screenwriters thinking?) without getting her killed. He gets an extremely lame ""gadget"" from a new and younger ""Q"", and slugs it out in incredibly unsuspensful and unimaginative fight sequences. In one scene where Bond fights a poor man's ""Odd-Job,"" the audience can telescopically predict the demise of his opponent, resulting in one of the most poorly staged fights in Bond history. One never feels the suspense created By Sean Connery when his Bond fights Peter Franks in the elevator scene from ""Diamonds are Forever"" or the excitement of the Japanese wrestler confrontation from ""You Only Live Twice.""  Along the way, more people die, with more collatoral damage in this Bond film than any previous.
There is an homage to Bond's Aston Martin that feels nothing more than gratuitous, and a contrived storyline that gives the audience (as well as Bond) an emotional victory, but a Pyrrhic one.
Skyfall entertains sufficiently, but ultimately strains hard to give Bond an identity rebirth, one that I am getting tired of. The biggest payoff is perhaps the resolution of Skyfall, as it hints that the next Bond entry may be more of a return to the ""Goldfinger"" formula that the producers once embraced. One can only hope.",1385683200,4,2776,4.817610062893082

This third Daniel Craig headlining flick completes the arc the began with Casino Royale--in which he made his first kill, completed his first mission, and bedded his first babe. In Skyfall, the ultra-modernized MI6 has come full circle to the beginning of the franchise.

I went back and forth about liking this installment. At first, as a long time super-fan, I loved the new interpretation of the celluloid super-spy, but Skyfall left me flat. Now that I've viewed the film a number of times, there are many more elements I like than those I don't. As an example of what I didn't like: I never think it is that clever to have a villain be at the finish line before the hero starts the race. Everything the good guys did were anticipated well before the scenario began--which is why Bond and his fellow MI6-ers play into the hands of Silva with anything they do. That type of plot device is nearly as maddening as any of Lucille Ball's comedic devices. But, the heart that 007 shows is grand in scope and his passion and loyalty to his work is beyond compare. His resourcefulness is far more interesting than his former reliance on gadgets.

5032778,5,B006X040NY,Great bond movie. i like the new bond he seams more human than the others but don't get me wrong i still love all the bond movies.,1385596800,,130,3.8518518518518516
5032779,2,B006X040NY,"This movie was a huge ""meh."" The story was not tight at all, and they relied way too heavily on the ""going back to basics"" approach.

The premise of the movie (that Bond is too old for this shit) was not well executed, and did not fit with the culture of Bond, anyway. He's been around for decades - he doesn't get tired. He's always Bond. That's part of his character, and this movie broke that some.

*Mild Spoilers*

The distinct lack cool gadgetry made this even less a Bond movie than the above. The biggest tech toy was a tiny radio about 1"" square, that actually looked like a little handheld radio, complete with telescoping antenna. Beyond retarded.

*End Spoilers*

The action was not exciting, and much of it seemed out of place. The acting was okay, but the material they were working with was lack-luster. All of the ""experienced field agents"" (including Bond) acted like they were new and didn't know how to carry themselves. Even the main villain, while his introduction scene was particularly good, was weak (character-wise) and inconsistent.

That said, It's not on the level of Meet the Feebles or Wolverine, so it doesn't deserve a 1 star rating. Die hard Bond might like it (or utterly hate it). Overall, I would not recommend anyone to watch it.",1385596800,,1266,4.654708520179372

5032783,4,B006X040NY,"The director still has too many scenes where Bond is running all over the place and I miss the old  James Bond Gadgets and wise cracks.  At least this one had a little humor  Having the old Austin Martin in was a nice twist although they made sure that it wouldn't be back.  ""M"" will certainly be missed.  But the new ""M"" should be excellent.  I believe he starred as one of the avengers with Sean Connery playing the villain and ""Mrs. Steel"" was the new ""M's"" lovely and sexy accomplice. The next James Bond Should be even better",1385510400,,530,4.303030303030303

5032789,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig and the screen writers of ""Casino Royale,"" ""Quantum of Solace,"" and now ""Skyfall,"" have returned to the core of Ian Fleming's original character, abandoning all the cartoon characters and phony stunts found in so many of the Roger Moore films. Bond is an ""R"" rated individual, not a ""PG"" one as depicted in all previous film versions. He's ruthless and cold and ""Skyfall"" shows this to the extreme. Ian Fleming would be proud of this film as well as its two previous Daniel Craig versions. Having been raised on Sean Connery as James Bond, I was never a fan of anyone else in Bond's skin... not until Craig. It is, however, far more the screen writers and directors sticking to Ian Fleming's original vision that the credit should go. If you love Bond, this movie will not disappoint.",1385510400,,797,4.7

5032791,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig may be the best James Bond yet.  He is the most realistic and is haunted by his past.  This movie gives a glimpse of his relationship to ""M"" and introduces a the new ""Q"" and other characters we will see in future movies.  ""Q"" and Bond have a funny back and forth confession due to Q's age which fits due to Q's young age which makes since in today's world.  A terrific villain and non stop action along with just enough gadgets make it the best movie since Casino Royale (2006).",1385510400,,491,4.247311827956989

5032793,5,B006X040NY,Great movie with a compelling story.  What happens when operations go bad?  How does an aging agnet handle a young man's game?  Certainly an update in the type of threat which faces the indomitable Bond.,1385510400,,203,4.742857142857143

5032799,5,B006X040NY,Excellent Bond film and nice to see that it is back to basics. Not so much about the toys but about the man with his strengths and weaknesses.

5032804,3,B006X040NY,"Decent movie
But many plot holes, and for an action/bond movie thats still saying something.

5032871,2,B006X040NY,"I did not finish the whole movie. I like Daniel Craig as James Bond, but could not
get past the unbelievability (if there is such a word), that James Bond's only response
to ""M""'s (Dame Judy Dench) allowing the sniper to take the shot that could have
resulted in Bond's death was to associate her name in a word identifying test as ""BITCH"".
Her rationale for allowing the sniper to take the shot was the typical politician's egalitarian
concept to sacrifice one for the good of all. I also thought the stunts were exceptionally
good but too many of them were too soon in what I saw of the movie. From what I did see
of the movie, it was rich in stunts/ graphics and poor on script and storyline.",1385164800,,695,4.3538461538461535
5032872,5,B006X040NY,Excellent 3rd. Daniel Craig as Bond. Casino Royale is my favorite. Quantum of Solace not so much. Skyfall is the key to Bond's elusive upbringing. Well worth the watch!,1385164800,,168,4.827586206896552

Confusing.  Great action, but it seems extremely contrived.",1385164800,2,361,4.682539682539683

5032894,3,B006X040NY,"Aside from the great Judi Dench and Albert Finney, the acting was serviceable, but not Grade A. Craig is a new kind of Bond, suburban and plebian, and lacks the swagger and panache of the Bonds before him.  His dinner jackets look like they were rented, rather than custom-made. A genuinely affecting M was the center of attraction in this movie, and whenever Dench and Craig appeared in the same scene, poor Bond simply melted into the background. The Bond Girls were probably the dullest collection of beauties since the beginning of the Bond adventures. The villain was genuinely frightening, but seemed patched together from bad guys of the past.
Effects were remarkable, however, if a little psychedelic; and gadgetry was held to a minimum, unfortunately. (There's a new Q in town, with all the charm and presence of a computer geek. He's not even ill-tempered.)
However, the producers know much more about their market than does an Amazon reviewer, and this movie broke all sorts of records. The Bond movies have entered a new era and will reach a vast new audience, throwing off millions of dollars for its backers, but the old gold-backed Bonds will always have their admirers.",1385078400,,1185,4.895522388059701

We don't do that anymore"" then you better have SOMETHING else that carries your film.  Many fight scenes were set in dark locals so the action was masked as were the terrible cut-aways on the train and market rooftop scene.  And the Borne-like plot line was so obvious and cheesy and the ex-agent turned villain has already been done in a Bond film too... so no originality, no character, no decent action.

I don't particularly think casting was spot on, choosing this man as Bond. He needs to be more of a ladies man like Connery. To be frank, this man is better cast as a serial killer, his face has a creepy essence to it with those ice cold eyes.

All through the film, so many places were executed ok, but didn't have the proper construction for real suspence or excitement, that ""it"" factor that's hard to define to a lay person, but when it has it, you know it.",1385078400,,624,4.2

Also, the latest movies have not contained as much of the sexual byplay as the earlier ones, which I have not missed at all. Craig's 007 is a lot more gritty.",1385078400,,450,4.172413793103448

Craig is the perfect Bond for the new Millennium, more hard boiled, but still very much 007. I love the scene on the train where he falls into the car amongst all the wreckage, and stops to shoot his cuffs!  Bardem is a bad guy cast from the Dr No/Ernst Blofeld mold and steals many of the scenes. I haven't paid much attention to the Bond movies since Connery left, the few that I saw I found dismal..

5032921,4,B006X040NY,"I think this is probably the best of the Craig/Bond franchise. Daniel Craig seems to have settled into the character and has an outstanding grittiness that feels more 'Bond' than any have in recent years. Having said that, there are a few problems with this one. The movie still relies too heavily on extended action scenes - almost like it doesn't trust itself to not constantly be in motion. The fight scenes also feel a bit too choreographed with an almost techno beat of punches and kicks. between the two, I honestly felt like Javier Bardem was speaking directly to the audience when he says ""all this running and jumping and fighting... it's exhausting!"". One could easily edit 15-20 minutes out of the run time with a little less time on each fight/chase. Now, just to be clear, I understand that this is an action/adventure film and that the nature of the character isn't talkative, but even action adventure can be smart and Daniel Craig's connection with the character is too good to waste on formulaic genre techniques.

On a positive note, I think that Ralph Fienne's joining the cast as M is a great move. Judy Dench was also a very good choice and it's a pity much of her run as M was with Pierce Brosnan. With some luck, the franchise will continue to attract a better support for what is the best Bond in a couple of decades. Now if they could just let go of some of the conventions.",1384905600,,1399,4.529644268774703
5032922,5,B006X040NY,"One of the better modern Bond films with lots of action.  The arrival of the villain in the last scene was a little predictable but for the music.  The Daniel Craig bond is a little more realistic with few gadgets in this one.  It was quite suspenseful throughout in my opinion.  Too bad about the house.

Edit:  There are a number of reviews about the holes in the plot.  Like most films, it is a work of fiction.  If you are not a critic and just watch to enjoy the ride, you will like this movie.
James Bond movies in particular are not real. They take a lot of artistic license with their plots.",1384819200,,599,4.192982456140351

5032930,3,B006X040NY,"Interesting to see so many five star ratings on this one. My guess is that reflects a generational split between those of us who saw all the Bond films from the beginning (less impressed) and those who are late to the party and prefer and more Bourne-like Bond, which Craig has always been. This is a far better offering than the dreadful Quantum of Solace but still fell a bit short in my view.  I will agree it is perhaps the most visually interesting Bond in a while. The Instanbul and Shanghai sequences were particularly beautiful and the opening chase scene was very impressive, even if you HAVE to wonder how even Bond could have survived that fall off the bridge at the end of the chase. The action is all downhill from there and ending was perhaps the least spectacular of any Bond film to date. As some others have noted, the movie does suffer from a lack of sense of humor, which was always a part of the earlier movies. Much too dark. Way too serious. But again, that's what's popular (the many Dark Knight comparisons) so Hollywood is only too happy to oblige. Interesting to see so many supporting characters rebooted but that was overdue. The thuggish Craig should join the parade and let someone younger and more debonaire take over as Bond. Not a bad movie but not a great one either. It was a little too stilted too dark and, in the end, somewhat flat, I would put it behind the more interesting Casio Royale (Craig version).",1384819200,,1443,4.50763358778626

5032943,5,B006X040NY,More of a classic Bond feel with this movie. Can't wait for the next 1 to come out. Now that Montypenny and Q are back. The new M seems to fit great as well. Lots of classic 1 liners in this movie. You will not be dissapointed.,1384819200,,227,3.851063829787234

5032947,3,B006X040NY,Standard Bond fare with few new plot twists.  Starts some new faces as standard characters but that is not enough to overcome a weak plot!,1384819200,,138,4.52

Craig brings a whole different interpretation to the role and that makes the franchise fresh.  The references to an aging agent in this movie were great fun for me and the plot was paced well.  Judy Dench is wonderful and I think I'll miss her in the Bonds to come, but so glad to know Craig is working on another.",1384819200,,477,4.2555555555555555

5032951,3,B006X040NY,Good action adventure as Bond movies usually are.  The problem with the Daniel Craig Bond movies is that there is absolutely no sense of humor to them.  The Bond movies always had humor that is sorely lacking since Craig became Bond.,1384819200,,233,4.658536585365853
5032952,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is James Bond. He brings the role to life, unlike other actors who merely performed. Moreover, in his Bond movies, gadgets play only minimal roles. As a result, Bond's resourcefulness, his humanity, and his skills are critical to his survival. Judi Dench also performs well as M. Indeed, all the actors performed well, a sign of good direction. The story is exciting and maintained our interest to the end. The locales, as usual, were fun to see, and the entire production was well worth the time we spent viewing it.",1384819200,,530,4.771739130434782

Good watch.
I wish there would have been a little more back story on how his parents died. If it was in a different Bond movie I don't remember it.

This is yet another underdeveloped, over-produced, superficial, imitation Bond flick.  I do like the idea of the plot and there are some good cinematic shots in the movie, but other than that it would be more interesting as a silent picture because the viewer would be forced to use an imagination of which none is present.",1384732800,,430,4.72

I should also include Juidi Dench as M, and the surprising promotion of Miss Moneypenny.  All in all, this has all the action, subtle sexuality, humor, and basic looks of the best James Bond.

The usual ""Just kill him already"" on both the good and the bad guys part.  The usual ""I'm crazy"" blah blah.  The usual one liners that try too hard ""Hate to waste a view"" after our hero shot, ""I always hated this place"" before blowing up home etc...  Really bad.  Absurd.  Boring.

We're now two films past that, and Daniel Craig is still making an excellent Bond. And this film manages to do the impossible: It stays true to what has come before for Daniel Craig, but it also brings things full circle, and returns to the series many of the elements that had been part of its previous history.

A great Bond film, and I look forward to the next one!

The title song is great and sets the mood, even though the visuals are too dark. And too much sex and violence throughout the film. But this is James Bond so I knew what I was signing up for. Bardem did a great job of being a menacing, and just plain yucky, villain.

5033064,4,B006X040NY,"Don't let the heading fool you, it may be a Judi Dench movie, but this is one hell of an enjoyable movie to watch.

So why do I call it the Judi Dench movie? Well, it's mainly about M and Bond just happens to be a part of it.

The general theme of this movie is that M, M16, and Bond himself are being outclassed by a more modern and sophisticated enemy. Rather than have someone who can infiltrate and shoot the crap out of bad guys, they need operatives who can hack computers and stop digital terrorists from taking over.

Okay, what's great and what's not so great about this movie? Let's go:

GREAT:

- Action scenes are absolutely fun to watch.
- The one-liners are great.
- We get to see a bit of Bond's origins.
- There's a lot of character development for Bond and M.
- The final battle scene ties up the movie nicely and is oh so fitting for the theme of the film.
- Well acted, and Judi Dench is a pleasure to see in action.

The -not- so great:

- The villain was said to be a ""brilliant"" agent. But he does nothing to show why he's brilliant, except being able to hack and plan things. I was expecting him to at least show off some martial arts skills or incredible marksmanship. NOPE!
- Why do director's insist on putting bad wigs on Javier Bardem?
- I didn't really understand why something in the villains mouth could change his facial appearance. They make no reference as to what it is or even try to explain it.
- The final confrontation with the villain is VERY anticlimactic.
- The characterization of the villain felt inconsistent. One moment he's ready to kill M, in the next, well... you'll see for yourself at the end of the movie.
- The way Javier Bardem portrayed the villain, made him seem rather weak. Just everything about him felt feeble, like he could easily be bested. This is inconsistent with everyone saying how this guy was the most bad ass agent that ever lived.
- Bond Women, were under used. Probably could have done the whole movie without them, which is a shame.
- Q didn't give any cool gadgets! Come on!

I know there's a lot of negatives on this list, but really this was a great movie that had great action and humor sprinkled in all the right places.",1384214400,,2198,4.305084745762712
5033065,4,B006X040NY,"***THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW SO BE WARNED***

When they first chose Daniel Craig as the next Bond, I just couldn't see it.  But then, Sean Connery is the quintessential Bond as far as I'm concerned so there was a tough act to follow for all that came after him.  While I will agree with some that this movie felt different, I disagree that it wasn't a Bond movie.  This is the computer age so it made sense MI6 relies on computers more than gadgets.  There were a few, though, but not nearly as many as Bond used to get.

One thing that does confuse me a bit - Moneypenny.  This movie made it seem like Bond and Moneypenny just met when she's been there all along.  Which makes me wonder where on the timeline do these Daniel Craig versions fall, anyway? I guess you just have to take it all at face value and not read too much into anything if you really want to enjoy this movie as it stands.

By itself, I enjoyed this as an action movie that just happened to involve James Bond.  Maybe it's not a traditional Bond movie but that didn't detract from it for me.  This is my first Daniel Craig Bond, though.  I've seen enough to want to see the first two now when I didn't really care before.

I did think the ending was inventive - bypassing the modern gadgets for (ok, I'll say it) McGyver-like substitutes.  I was sad to see that this would be the last film with Dame Judy Dench as M.  I've always liked her but I guess we all have to move on.  I do like Ralph Fiennes as the new M, though.  It'll be interesting see what they come up with for the next movie.",1384128000,,1571,4.1490066225165565
5033066,5,B006X040NY,"I couldn't stand Casino Royal but Skyfall is arguably the best Bond film ever.  There is a classic Bond feel to this film; it goes right back to its roots. Daniel Craig is outstanding and Javier Bardem puts on an even better performance as the twisted, broken yet brilliant villain whom I couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for. I don't want to give away the plot but the story is tight and the action is superbly executed without seeming redundant or filling space. If you are expecting a love story subplot or a bevy of tantalizing Bond girls you will be quite disappointed. Bond and his girls keep their close on most of the time for this film. This story's heart is in the sadness of the profession, the cold brutal realities of living a life of murder, at times it reminded me a bit of Bourne Identity with its emphasis on the psychological wear and tear of service. The cinematography is exquisite with one of the most beautiful film opening credits I've ever seen in a film.  The problem with a film like this is that it makes it very difficult to have a follow-up.",1384128000,,1071,4.431472081218274

5033069,2,B006X040NY,"Movie is entertaining; but it is not James Bond.

This movie betrays many of classic James Bond must-haves we grew up to expect from 007. This Bond character feels more like 1950s spy character; not the 007 of British MI6. Kind of reminds me of mission impossible movies more than of traditional James Bond movies.

WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT
1. In this movie James Bond meets McGyver... Really?!? Bond is missing all the futuristic cool toys we expect from 007, so he has to improvise with minimal gear.
2. Bond does not get the girl!!! I have a feeling they will only be friends..
3. Bad guy does not have a strong sidekick... CMON it's a must have!!!!

It is a new world and a more sophisticated expectation of what 100 million dollars will buy in a movie. This one was a raw, exciting, and realistic portrayal of the nasty business of espionage. Ian Fleming would not approve, but Ian Fleming didn't have to live in our world and live with knowledge of how things work. The old Bond movies were like watching and old 1930's sci fi with space wind blowing our hero's hair as he clutched the outside of his ship while sailing through space. It was great in 1930, but scientifically laughable now. Bond porks fewer ladies but gets beaten up more. Just like in real life.",1384041600,,757,4.375886524822695

I really do not have the desire to waste a lot of time on the review when the movie was so painful to get through. Just know this, if you want well written dialogue, a well thought out plot, or themes that are actually examined in a meaningful way that challenges anyone - this is not for you.

It has a story line relevant to today's world and it also presents a not-so-invincible bond character.  In doing so it really re-invents James Bond.  However without going into details of the film, the ending is too long.  The final fight scene in Skyfall could have been shortened by 15 minutes easily without losing any important details.  Unfortunately it becomes too self-important at the end, hence I cannot say this is the the best bond movie ever but it is close.

I've had people who literally dislike the Bond genre tell me they LOVED seeing this and thanked me for making them watch this.  In fact, I lent this dvd out and I have to get it back!

I've been a Bond film fan since I was around 7 years old, so I can rightfully say, Daniel is one of the best Bonds to date, the Sean Connery of this era of Bond.  The plot of the movie is interesting, and the backstory behind it all is really thrilling, although I wish there was more of the backstory covered and explained, but alas, it's great nonetheless.

It has fun parts, and some cool new characters, however I didn't enjoy it as much as the last two movies.  Too much of this movie is spent on the topid of Bond being 'too old' or 'damaged' or whatever, this takes away from time they could have spent on a better plot.  There are no cool gadgets in this movie either.  Javier did a great job as the villain, and Daniel Craig is good as usual.  This movie was super over hyped.  Good but not great.

If you haven't seen the other two before this one they are worth a checking out.  This is the last of 3 of the origin story and I think they wrapped it up pretty well, telling you more about his past than we have found out before, making James a lot more human than the super human in some of the others.

The whole plot was just plain silly and Bond walked around like a sad sack through the whole thing. He had a scruffy little chin beard and needed a shave as well. Bond was a dashing character, not a moping loser. All the costars were new and obviously made to appeal to a politically correct, multicultural audience. M is now a black woman in her early twenties..Q is a hipster barely out of high school who gives Bond a camera and a gun telling him 'we don't go in for all those exploding gadgets anymore..its all done with computers now'.

Quantum of Solace made me sick but The Sky isn't the limit on how awesome skyfall is. Great action, loved the vintage roots and story and the villain did his job well, creeped you out and you couldn't wait for Bond to lay the smack down on him. Great Job!

5033166,5,B006X040NY,"Skyfall marked the 50th anniversary of James Bond on film (no that was not a typo). Bond is much different now than he once was, but at the same time he is much like how he was when he first began. While the tone of this story wasn't quite as action filled as some of the other entries it undeniably has the best cinematography of any other movie in the historical franchise.

The production and set designs were outstanding and even the wardrobe, particularly that of James Bond's (provided by Tom Ford) helped make the movie visual gold. The plot was fantastic in the way that it was unassuming and respected the intelligence of the audience. Because of this we were led to some more surprising events in the film. Traveling the world is a tradition in James Bond, but you have never seen it like this before. The locales were so exquisitely showcased it simply gave you an undeniable desire to make the journey to places like Shanghai and Macau.

I think the final showdown is one of the best ever. Overall if you are looking for a run and gun James Bond action flick, maybe try one of the Pierce Brosnan pictures, but for the first time in a long time I felt like I was watching art in a James Bond movie in a case of both style and substance.",1380240000,7,1247,4.347639484978541
5033167,5,B006X040NY,"James Bond is a rite of passage for most young men.  Babes, bad guys, guns, and gadgets-what's not to like?  I was initiated at fourteen with ""The Spy Who Loved Me' where Roger Moore was Bond and the eye candy was Barbara Bach and there was a car that turned into a submarine.  From there I saw the master, Sean Connery, on television showings and it became apparent that Moore was the lesser of two Bonds.  Regardless, I stayed loyal to the series even though they became parodies of themselves and were pretty much forgotten by me shortly after seeing them.  Pierce Brosnan was OK as 007 but there was still something lacking.  When Daniel Craig assumed the Bond role in ""Casino Royale"" there was a seismic change to the series.  No longer were the stories played for laughs because this was an agent to be taken seriously.  The tone is continued with ""Skyfall"" where we see gray areas of Bond's psyche and he is given a back story that explains some things and leaves enough ambiguity about his past that you want more.  ""M""(Judi Dench)is given a slightly darker side to her personality which is worlds away from Bernard Lee smoking his pipe behind a desk.  Javier Bardem is probably the best Bond villain since Auric Goldfinger.  What elevates the film is the narrative which prior films had gotten away from and substituted with comic book antics.  There are enough twists and turns here to set the series up for years to come.  What I do like is while steering the film to the future it cleverly references the past.

This is a generic Daniel Craig action film that has no relationship to James Bond. Anyone familiar with the film history or the books knows that they've created a new character with this film. It is not James Bond in any way, shape or form.

The cinematography is nice and the audience who is praising this film is praising a non-Bond action film.

Nothing Bond does in this film is of any consequence. He's not the hero. He could have died at the beginning and the outcome for everyone else would have been the same. Bond fails at everything he does in this film and he's a feminist, incompetent boy that needs women to do everything for him.

I had a couple of ""What? Come on man"" moments in this movie but overall, I like the acting and of course, the action. I think the character play between Bond and the rest is really good, especially Moneypenny. My favorite line in the movie is when Mallory tells James not to screw it up.

A beautifully made, well-scripted Bond flick which pays homage to the past of the franchise and sets the bar high for the next incarnations. Mendes directs the action sequences perfectly, with some memorable imagery (gorgeous in HiDef) which raises it nearly to the level of an art film. Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes and villain Javier Bardem bring their high standards to the proceedings, and there's an enjoyable new take on ""Q"" as well. Need we add at this point that Daniel Craig is possibly the best James Bond of them all? Easily my favorite installment since the early days of Sean Connery. (There's a surprise bit in the latter section of the movie with a notable star. I suspect the part was originally offered to Connery, but I believe he has retired completely from acting, and probably wouldn't have wanted to have any more to do with 007 anyway.)",1378684800,,894,4.7006369426751595

Nonetheless, if you're a Bond fan, you can't pass up on this movie; and if you're not, but like a good movie, then you must still watch this one.

Skyfall thrusts Bond into a very real 21st century adventure with great tips of the hat to Bonds of the past. If you are a fan and have seen all the older movies the ""inside"" jokes will really make you appreciate this film even more.

I had given up on Bond flicks for quite a while before Craig was crowned the new title of 007 and he certainly deserves it.  Not only does this movie have all you would expect as far as danger, beautiful women, gadgets, it has possibly the worse villain in modern movie history-the oh-so creepy moth-man guy from Silence of the Lambs, impeccably acted I might add.

Love the delving into Bond's past--you never get this in the other installments--love M as the Mother figure, love Bardem's motive as the abandoned child. By the end of the film as pieces of Bond's identity have been burned to the ground, you have the plausible return of familiar elements missing from the first two Daniel Craig installments.

It'd be five stars if they made it the moviie that they'll never be able to make: one with minimal fantastic elements, set once again in the 1960s.",1377302400,,669,4.661016949152542

Lots of action and tense scenes had me on the edge of my seat, BUT....I sure would like to know how 007 survived being shot off the top of the train to wind up in the drink; how the villain escaped his well-guarded cell and how did his comrades know exactly where and when to have the car ready to pick him up.  This film didn't live up to the Bond scenarios of old.  Daniel Craig is OK, no one can replace Sean Connery, and I was glad to see M is going to be a man again (always thought it was a major mistake to change the sex of MI5's boss).",1377043200,,595,3.860655737704918

Bond's, and M's personal journey's an important part of the story, a dip into the cold blunt realities of life. Not exactly the regular spy fantasy romp. The second viewing, in my home, made it personal for me. Maybe a feeling difficult to get in a crowded theatre, hungry for action, not reflection. At my age and position in life, I could relate to M and Bond. There is enough of the Bond thing to satisfy, but there is also a need to swim in deeper waters.

Dark Knight came out first,  and after a while this movie starts to feel like the Dark Knight. This really feels like a reboot for the series, the evil Quantum organization from the first two films is left behind. We get a cool new M and some other familiar Bond characters show up. This is a good Bond movie, but pretty overrated. I think people are falling in love with the wonderful cinematography because the story is pretty flat. The list of covert agents(the noc list from MI), the villian allows himself to be captured(the joker from Dark Knight), (squeezed in a gay villian....yawn Diamonds are forever)...is there anything original about this plot? Great chemistry between Craig and Deinch...But overall we have an overrated film.",1376611200,,870,4.8
5033263,5,B006X040NY,The latest series of James Bond movies with Daniel Craig are prequels to the early Sean Connery films. As such these are some of the best Bond films.

There a few surprises along the way.,1376611200,,353,4.130434782608695

Craig's Bond is the antithesis of the pretty boys who've held the 007 designation since the aforementioned Scotsman did and it's a pleasure to watch him wreak havoc on the minions of evil.

I have every one and this movie is the one I can watch over and over.  Craig (and I am sorry Sean Connery) is now my favorite Bond.  This sealed the deal.  What I like about this movie is the abscence of campy lines - all the excess women - and yes the stupid gadgetry.  What I love about this movie is Craig raw and emotional.  This man rocks as Bond.  His essense is palpable.  I like the introduction of Ben Wishaw as Q - so geeky sexy - and of course MONEYPENNY!

5033276,1,B006X040NY,"I hereby nominate Judith Dench for the worst acting job in the history of the world.  She has no sense of her role, opting, instead, to verbally abuse every unfortunate who gets within shouting distance, for no reason what-so-ever.  That's all she does.  She is not a leader; she is an old battle-axe.

The opening scene where she directs the action in Turkey, while sitting back in London, with absolutely no idea what is actually happening, qualifies as the most improbable sequence in all of the James Bond movies. I mean, Bond and his Bond girl are chasing this guy all over Istanbul, and every few seconds you hear Dench yell, ""What's going on now?  Go after him!""

Craig's ridiculously buffed, jug-eared, distracted and bored Bond isn't much better, as it makes one really appreciate Lindsay Lohan's portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor.

The plot is so stupid, it makes ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" look like a documentary.  Things like Bond getting submerged in a pond and emerging dry.  Or, Bond getting shot off a speeding train, falling about 50 stories into a river, then going over a waterfall, and ending up in a tropical paradise, making love to the inevitable local beauty.  And then, when he makes his return to London, they make him take a battery of fitness tests to make sure he's in shape!

5033307,3,B006X040NY,"This isn't a bad movie but this James Bond feels somehow different to me. Up to ""Die Another Day"", I had a sense of continuing story line that was helped along by the various movies that relating back to the movies before that helped fill out the James Bond character. With Casino Royale, that linkage was broken, and this has continued thru to the current movie. The reason for this appears to be the idea that all of a sudden you would show how James Bond got his license to kill. Well, that wouldn't be a bad movie IF you used a flash back to go back in time to show how this happened and then came back forward to now and the story all falls into place. However, this wasn't done. You get a story that ALL takes place NOW and that destorys any of the pass links to the previous movies! This requires the viewer who is used to the links being their to all of a sudden dump them all. For me, that's asking a lot. Anyway, this movie is pretty good but somehow it just doesn't meet the standards that I have and that's a real shame as Daniel Crag makes a good Bond but for some reason the Bond feeling just isn't there anymore. A real shame...",1375747200,,1143,4.153153153153153
5033308,2,B006X040NY,"I am an avid James Bond fan have seen (more than once) and own every 007 movie made - but this truly is not a good ""James Bond"" movie. It began when Bond's gun didn't work right or he was out of ammunition at the very beginning of the movie - major blunder. Then a few minutes later, his assistant took a shot at him - of course by mistake - to which Bond falls into the depth of the ocean. I don't want to spoil the plot (what little there is of it) for those of you who have not yet seen the movie.

My personal opinion is the movie was rather ""dark and stinky"" - - - which kind of translates into a bad word unfortunately.  Just not a fun film to watch and that's what Bond movies typically have been since 1960s, fun, full of intrigue and excitement, this was pretty much a downer from beginning to end with tons of special effects thrown in to make sure that people didn't get up and walk out at the movie theater, I suppose.

Though it's quite obvious that quite a few people enjoyed this movie, by the high ratings, so there are those who obviously liked it, but for those older folks like me who grew up on Bond movies - it's just not up to par and I didn't care for the movie - the only good part about the movie was the song, in my opinion.",1375747200,,1250,3.992

Goldfinger was the first film in the series to really begin to utilize tech toys, but though they did, the Bond persona as played by Sean Connery remained the no compromise enforcer of MI6. Then began the slide into ridiculous of the Roger Moore  era. While later Bonds began to bring the series back to it's roots, it was with the Daniel Craig era that we have finally got Bond all the way back. Skyfall continues this trend, de-emphasizing the importance of gadgets and letting Bond be the imperfect but dominant player that controls the film and the franchise. Now with Skyfall the old chapters are closed, and the way forward promises more Bond excellence to come, and the transition is engrossing, entertaining and ultimately fulfilling.",1375488000,,863,4.863945578231292

No scantily clad leading lady with a double entendre name (Pussy Galore anyone?) No, wise cracks during action scenes. And, most importantly, no super rich, twisted villain looking to take over the world. So, if you are interested in watching a Bond film you will be disappointed because this is not it.
However, if you are looking to watch a pretty good action movie with some decent special effects and some unpredictable twists you may enjoy this dark movie. But, I am pretty sure Ian Fleming would not approve of this latest adaptation of his beloved character.

5033329,1,B006X040NY,"The familiar Daniel Craig; exotic locations; and intriguing stunts; lure you into watching a terrible script; written by the mind of a disturbed second-grader.

Throughout the film the script conveniently skips obstacles. For instance an unarmed Bond is shown chasing a professional assassin armed with a machine gun across open ground; next frame; suddenly Bond is wrestling with the guy.

The bad guy hatches an intricate plan, (we are told years in the making), for MI6 to unwittingly bring him to London and close to ""M""; when the guy could accomplish the same thing by buying a plane ticket to London and driving to the Capitol building.

The gist of the story is a bad guy out to kill ""M"". Yet, when we hear ""M's"" side of the story; ""M"" is admittedly in the wrong, and the bad guy has good reason for revenge.

The insertion of a homosexual bad guy and Bond seeming to enjoy the homosexual flirting; reveals this Bond film script was given to the homosexual lobby for political motive, and the script-writer was chosen by politics rather than by merit.

The script is so bad; it has ruined the credibility of the Bond franchise. I want a refund. I will wait for any future Bond films to come to TV.",1375315200,19,1204,4.607476635514018

What do you mean??? This is a Bond film, for Christ's sake! It's one really dumb thing after another. One scene was somewhat promising though, the very last one where the M's office looks like the M's office and M finally looks like M. At the end of the movie, I was ready to give up on Bond altogether, but this closing scene gave me some hope. ""Bond will return""? I sure hope he will, but I don't get my hopes too high.

5033339,5,B006X040NY,"First of all, let me just say that comparing the newer bonds, Craig included, to Sean Connery is like comparing a modern, finely tuned Lamborghini to an old 60s Mustang. Both are wonderful, but very much different in their own way. To me personally, no one can ever compete with Connery, but Craig's portrayal and Skyfall are probably the best things that have ever happened to bond since the 60s. Casino Royale was excellent, but Quantum of Solace fell short because there simply was too much emphasis on the action. They might as well have called it James Bourne. But Skyfall is a true jewel and a fitting 50th Anniversary film because it has all the ""Usual Refinements"" of a great Bond film while being a thoroughly modern, refreshing take on a legend, with a gripping story and a truly mind-blowing ending. Javier Bardem, in particluar, plays without a doubt the best bond Villain since Blofeld, no question about it.

If you've given up on the Craig Bond films because, like me, you were too appalled by Quantum of Solace, I urge you to give Skyfall a look. It truly has turned the tables for the franchise and it has brought Bond back into being the thrilling symbol of cool that he once was.

Watch her face communicate her controlled fear under sexy allure.

SKYFALL is for we guys who saw them all in first run theaters because this one has the same result for real fans as the newer STAR TREK movies do for real Trek fans... little touches from the best of the past, and THE CAR too!  This movie is not killed with too much CGI, and the tension is prolonged and motivated.  Of course, in today's world of fear of sexuality, very little feminine skin is on view, a real downer considering the gals available, and it lacks levels of irony and ""insider"" wit not seen much today except in Tarantino.  Also, it avoids any political commentary on world tensions (except govt officials who do not believe in intelligence actions) today, and instead has the crazed revenge-seeking lone villain that would be cardboard except for the actor playing it (almost a reprise of his villain in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN).

Skyfall and this ""version"" of Daniel Craig were very satisfactory over all. Some of the sequences, like the villain's escape from MI-6 HQ and the subsequent chase through London to Whitehall(?), were suspenseful but ultimately over-the-top with the special effects.

The villain almost had superpowers, he survived cyanide? Superman could but a human? Well the plot sickens, not very much of a story at all, and there should have been. The destruction of Bonds house was not believable either, Bond has a shotgun against 11 or so men with machine guns, yeah bond will win this one. The worst thing that could have been done was to destroy the Aston Martin DB9, what was the purpose of that? I could not watch the whole movie in one sitting, and I am too stubborn to not finish the movie, so I did, and i would have been happier to have NOT finished the movie.

And although I miss the old Q, I highly approve of the new one.

Daniel Craig is level pegging with Connery in terms of character portrayal - from me that is praise indeed! Added to his performance is a really good story (been a long time waiting for one) and overall a no-brainer - if you like Bond or action or both, this is for you. I just hope that the team of writers of the new Bond stories can keep up this high level. It looks like Mr Craig has got quite a few more Bond movies in him yet.",1374537600,2,593,4.033898305084746

5033385,4,B006X040NY,"With the death of the writer of Bond movies, this 007 was written by a new writer as I understand it.  A woman. It had a depth to it.  No, there wasn't as much techie cool stuff, but there was a personal depth to it that 007 movies typically don't have.  I have to say I was both thrilled and yet let down.  007 movies are known for the cool techie stuff and the romance as well as the action.  If this 007 had a few more gadgets, a little more action AND the depth it portrayed......to me....., this would be the ultimate 007 James Bond movie!  Not like the old, not like the new, but simply perfect.

That being said, the acting  was superb, the plot good.  Would I watch it a second time? Probably not.  It just didn't connect with me as the audience at the level I expected it to.  If you come to this movie with no expectations, you will most probably find it entertaining.  Its not a bad movie, I gave it 4 stars, that means its worth the watch even if it doesn't hit all the right magical spots for everyone.",1374451200,,1015,4.096446700507614

5033387,5,B006X040NY,"I saw this movie in theaters, and since owning the dvd I have seen it over 3 times. So I figured, why not do a review?

Casino Royale revamped my faith in James Bond. Die another Day was ok, but Pierce Brosnan was losing his step a bit. Alas, a man by the name of Daniel Craig took the reigns and ever since 2006, he has fit the suit and persona quite well.

Skyfall stars Daniel Craig as Mr. 007 himself, Judi Dench reprising her role as M, and Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner. We also have a strong cast of newcomers that include: Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, Naomie Harris as Eve, Berenice Marhole as the beautiful Severine, and finally Javeer Bardem as the villian Silva. The cast was great; Javeer Bardeem was very convincing in his role.

The Story line is what you would expect from a GOOD Bond movie. Although the film itself deals with issues such as Bond losing his focus and having to regain his composure and mentality to become Bond again, there is a lot of suspense, really nice action, and oh yes, very BEAUTIFUL women.

So overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Skyfall from start to finish. I really enjoyed the opening sequence where Adele sings her song for the film appropriately titled: Skyfall. Great cast, good story, a lot of action, and more importantly, Skyfall is James Bond as he is meant to be. Sam Mendes did a marvelous job directing this movie.

I do want to mention that I have been hearing rumors that once Daniel Craig's contract is up, that it is possible that Idris Elba(fantastic actor by the way) will be taking the reigns as the new 007. Even if that does happen, I have a strong feeling that Daniel Craig will continue to take James Bond in the right direction, and furthermore, we can expect even better things to come in the forseeable future.

9.5/10",1374364800,4,1785,4.476923076923077
5033388,5,B006X040NY,This movie is by far the best of the new Bond movies. I would highly recommend it. If you are concerned about not having seen any of the other movies in this series don't worry too much. This movie can stand alone. I say it is a must watch even for non-Bond lovers.,1374364800,2,265,4.018867924528302
5033389,5,B006X040NY,"There really isn't a James Bond film, including the well-loved Casino Royale, that I can say I love.  Except for this one.  I can enjoy the diversion of Bond I guess, but mostly it's Gadget, Gadget, Boobs, Snark, Gadget, Chase Scene, Gadget, Boobs, Credits.  And while the opening chase scene in this one is more engaging than most, until the opening credits sequence with the Adele song, I didn't think I'd love Skyfall, either.  But the movie from the moment the first piano chords of that opening song strike up until the end is genuinely heavy.

I'm not a huge Sam Mendes fan, but I think he's plenty good, and this is the film where, for my tastes, all of his skills rose to a masterpiece-level peak.  The pacing is perfect, rhythmic without being sappy, energetic without being spastic.  The cinematography by the great Roger Deacons is heart-meltingly good, maybe his best work since The Man Who Wasn't There.

I've read some reviewers calling it nearly Emo with all its moodiness.  I didn't think it went THAT moody.  And I also didn't think it went over-dark and cynical in its moodiness.  What it is, in some parts, is genuinely sad, and in a cathartic way, which is how sadness in fiction is supposed to go, in my opinion.

The blu-ray is great-looking, showcasing a dozen or more shots that would each be the visual highlight of most films.  The sets change often, evoking several vivid emotional tones throughout, lingering on each one just enough to create a longing, then changing to another, which is an underrated filmmaking skill.

There's lots more to say, but that's enough for my two cents.  This is the only Bond blu-ray in my CD wallet, and I'm glad to be able to join the club finally.",1374364800,3,1709,4.631229235880399

5033391,4,B006X040NY,"We see Daniel Craig happy to let ""M"" make the grand final curtain.  I was so upset to lose her I panned the entire production every way I could - and I apologize.  The film was ""topstuff"" as always.  The poem she quotes says it - the mature and clear-eyed awareness of our own limitations does not end, but rather empowers us to our best work and a chance to ""finish with a flourish"" - and an epitaph that is less unfortunate a report.

I always think:  Too much brawn and not enough brains - and the mystery and espionage pathways suppressed by the noise and muscle, and evil for evil's sake.  The whole dumb world is having too much fun making unhappy stories when we need creative plots that create good old-fashioned passion for the chase, and find and share a sense of worth and patriotism.  Not more sickening noir.  Sadism and pleasure in murder???  The original books and stories share the message of good winning over evil in an oddly-wholesome and healthy way and with appreciation that the battlefields are in offices, casinos, and even on lovely ocean-going vessels.

I thought the Bond Film makers would understand that , above all, and not  just give in to the trend of selling the idea of a dystopian mess , getting worse every day.

The glam and seductions were there , but  almost ZERO moments of delight, surprize , happiness, fun with discovery of neat new things in the world. MY PLEA IS TO BOND FANS ( like me , since the 60s ) TO MAKE A CAUSE OF THIS MATTER to the makers, to rediscover and share the better lights in the thing that we need.

OKay..Iove Ralph Finnes - but God Bless Dame Dench and long may she live.  The books had fun with ""M"" - and Bond called the man ""Mother"" with the unspoken toast to him, in his role as supervisor over his agents.  I just went thru all my dvds , but find no such reference in the filmsz - ( Lotte Lenya falls down - a blooper in ""From Russia with Love""  she pops right back up and regains here Rosa Klebb military bearing and dignity and no one gives her even a glance over it - cool)  BondJamesBond.

We've all seen the myriad reboots or film treatments of TV series in which the original star has a cameo - with the many, many references to Bond's past I kept waiting for the old M, Moneypenny, and Q to pop in.  Javier Bardem reels back and forth from the arrogance of Goldfinger to the innapropriate laughter of Walken to the ineptitude of Kotto.  M is wounded, walks a mile in the dark, jumps to her feet for a final confrontation - And then suddenly (watch the movie).  The plot has some problems as well: Let's go hide where no one can find us, except let's let them find us, and make sure that although our organization knows where we are they do nothing to support us.  Oh, and let's not take along anything that can be construed as a WEAPON, for heaven's sake, so we can honor Macguyver while we honor Bond's past.  All those complaints aside, Craig is a terrific Bond in attitude, and does a fair job dealing with his own limitations even though the script keeps hitting us over the head with that theme.  You almost expect passersby in the Tube to ask Bond if he's up to the challenge.  Judi Dench has forever been the M with facets - a strong presence, an M who understands consequences and gray areas, and who ultimately is loyal and responsible.  Naomie Harris was gorgeous if a little mouthy for a junior agent, but left little time for Berenice Marlohe who's character could have been fleshed out more (although Bond did, of course).  And Bardem, and Ralph Fiennes, fine actors who are given little to work with in the script.  Fiennes is a bureaucrat who proves himself in action, and the outstanding introduction of Bardem's Silva falls apart later.  All in all, I'll place this bond in the Top Ten for plot and villain, Top Five for action sequences, but in the second division for the humor and ladies.",1373760000,,2038,4.460916442048518

5033454,3,B006X040NY,"so lets see, the movie opens and it has a scene about that computer drive and that chase scene which was very similar to the one of taken2... well its a small world after all...
and after a few obvious car product placement, a train scene where the train will not stop eventhough the carrage is destroyed, bond is shot and falls off a bridge. we all know he survives, and this moment felt a bit like the nuke in indiana jones4
i mean come on a gunshot+fall off a bridge at a high speed (momentum would tell us he would hit the other side of the river before he would hit the water, but this is a nitpick)+falling flat on his back+waterfall+adelle should = to a dead bond but no. one does not simply kill 007
he just reapears, then finds out that a hack caused mi6 to blow up... (not even remotely possible) which leads bond to go on an almost wild goose chase that is somehow known. so after 1hour or so we finally see the villain(cyanide is not an acid BTW)
and after a plan that is impossible to happen, silvia escapes and tries to kill M but fails so they hide in scotland...
why scotland, where if they are found, they are sitting ducks.

the gadgets are very weak, a radio and a gun... when q talked about the exploding pen i said yeah why nt bring that aesome gadget back. i mean enemy of the state had better gadgets. even stormbreaker had better gadgets than a gun and a tracking device. also a 40 year old british car that was rotting inn a garage wouldn never start.

after a scene rip off from home alone...  really? home alone? couldn't rip off something a little less noticeable?
M is killed which was a surprise to be honest
and so was silvia the end.

the only person i was sad to see die was the car from goldfinger.

also, near the end of this movie, it seemed that bond was just in the way of silvia's attempt to kill M, which made bond more of a bodyguard and less of a secret agent

one thing i wondered... what happened to that hard drive bond died for, wasn't that the whole reason he left for his mission?",1373414400,,2028,4.187179487179487

5033465,5,B006X040NY,"Well, Bond will never get quite as old fashioned as ""From Russia with Love"", but for a modern Bond movie, this was very close. It was also courageous. The movie features a noticeably older looking Daniel Craig as Bond, a look that they took pains to sell by leaving the gray stubble of a beard on his chin in scene after scene. This Bond has been beat up, shot up, and literally left for dead. He's in no condition to go back into service. Only his willpower and experience recommend him as the choice to hunt down a dangerous threat to MI6 itself.

The adventure itself is gritty and at times disturbing, as a former MI6 agent with surprising resources seeks vengeance over an old score. His beef is not with Bond, but Bond is what stands between the traitor and unthinkable crimes against British Intelligence.

The Blu ray presentation is top notch. Sound and picture blend perfectly together to allow yourself to forget your TV and become immersed in the story. It's too bad that it looks like we have to wait until 2016 for the next installment.

5033474,3,B006X040NY,"This installment of the Bond 007 franchise was updated to reflect the current atmosphere of ""cyberterrorism"" that could easily take place given the global climate and reliance on computers for nearly everything.

In the beginning of the movie, Bond is after an assassin/agent who managed to somehow procure a sensitive list of undercover agents. Mr. Silva, the main villian and former MI6 agent, begins releasing the names of the agents publicly, causing a huge uproar against M and the spy world in general. The only way to stop more names from being released is to take out Silva. To make matters worse, Silva has a vendetta against M for jettisoning him during a mission where he basically went rogue. Feelings were hurt and he has held a grudge ever since.

Overall critique- To me, the beginning 12 minutes were the best in the entire film. Chase sequences are notoriously difficult to pull off as you can have a lot going on in a very short span of time. Skyfall did a nice job of keeping up with the action without losing the viewer. Having said that, I was not a fan of the tower/skyscaper fight. Entirely too dark for my liking. I've read a few other reviewers mentioning the play on shadows and light, but when you basically can't see the action or tell what's going on, you probably need to rethink the scene. The final battle scene at Skyfall was rather exciting, although it seemed extremely farfetched. I know, I know, it's Bond, everything is farfetched on some level. But when the helicopter flew up to the house, I was waiting for Silva or one of his henchmen to pull out an RPG and take out the entire structure. It would have changed the entire dynamic of the scene.

Silva- To me, this was the biggest disappointment in the movie. I expect my villains to be extremely evil, to the point of where you cringe simply thinking about them. Silva was almost the exact opposite, which might be partly due to his use of cyberterrorism rather than other weapons. Examples of his ""kindness"", if you want to call it that:

1. He took over an entire island by sending out warnings that there was a chemical leak, allowing the residents to flee. Most of the bond villains from the past would have simply caused a chemical leak, along with a large body count.
2. He let the groundskeeper live, when he easily could have shot him.
3. Despite his hatred for her, he couldn't take out M when he had the chance.

I had a problem with Bond/M/Silva church scene, in that M could have pulled the trigger, thus killing herself and Silva, and the outcome would have been almost the same. It would have played on James' psyche, but **spoiler** M and Silva would be dead, with the groundskeeper and James walking away from the firefight.

Q- This was a disappointment and a half. Part of the intrigue of Bond has always been the cool gadgetry he receives from Q. Making it into a Q branch does seem somewhat more believable, but they didn't supply Bond was much at all. Boo!

Moneypenny- Nice touch introducing her early in the film and cluing viewers in at the very end. I realized a few seconds early that the character seemed like a moneypenny type character and then the dialogue confirmed my suspicions. Good job, Skyfall!

Sadly, I'm no sure I'd want to watch this movie again. I've watched all the Bonds at least once (as hard as that may be), Casino Royale more than I care to admit, and Quantum of Solace 2 or 3 times. Maybe after a second viewing I will feel differently, but really this seemed a little disappointing. I'm sure the bankruptcy of MGM in the middle of production didn't help matters any.",1373241600,,3607,4.564142194744977
5033475,5,B006X040NY,"I have to admit, I had a very hard time even ordering this movie because I had heard too many people say that bond had converted to drinking ale's instead o the signature vodka martini ""shaken not stirred"".
However, since they worked arund it by not having him being seen ordering a drink through the entire movie, i was pleased, even though you do see him drinking other things, he makes no mention of the signature drink so it was a bit easier to well ""swallow"" pardon the pun. For future movies, I do hope the writer/director get's his/her head out of their butt's and bring Bond back to drinking what he should be. If you want to make a movie of someone drinking beer, better focus on Felix, HE is the one that drank beers NOT BOND. Don't change such an iconic detail! t kils the feel of the movie.

Known for the opening gambits in these films, this is one of the most exciting yet. Zooming motorcycles across the rooftops of the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul and turning into a train chase was thrilling to watch. The action is nonstop.

5033483,2,B006X040NY,"You know, after dozens of films with the same name, same characters, same formula (""pretty"" women, super spies, unreal chases and fights), it gets old. When Daniel Craig first came into the role he breathed a different kind of energy into it and I was briefly interested again... but that was short lived. Enough is enough is enough. Enough milking the same IP's, enough making sequels, and enough remakes. Lastly, enough James Bond; make something new for a change... or isn't anyone capable of this anymore.

My eyes began to roll within the first five to ten minutes of this film; you are presented with a motorcycle chase that goes to rooftops and ends on a train - absurd. I like escapism and suspension of disbelief but that doesn't mean I want to watch a giant purple dinosaur or guys chasing one another via motorcycles on rooftops. Again, in this film like so many past, you have a once good guy, usually from intelligence, turned bad. Tired. Tired. Tired.",1373155200,,965,4.710059171597633

I have been really happy with EON's choice of Bond Girls, sticking with fairly unknown actresses with talent. These girls don't disappoint here! Nor does Bardem's baddie. What a frightening yet charismatic villain. You'd want to hang out with the guy but you'd be scared to death all the while. I was reminded of past baddies created by Fleming and how they appeared in the books, and was strongly reminded of a few classic guys with Silva. Judy Dench finally got a meatier plot-line and it was wonderful to see. The ending, the ending of Skyfall made me giddy and it did what a Bond film should do entertain and make you excited for the next film. Mission accomplished!",1372982400,,773,4.649635036496351

The movie was intense, fun, full of action and good acting.  The big bad in the film works because he's slightly insane and he Bardem makes him believable.  If you love Bond you'll love this film.  If you're not a Bond fan but do love action/espionage films you will love this film anyway.",1372896000,,460,4.428571428571429
5033499,5,B006X040NY,"The original Bond character as conceived by Ian Fleming was edgy.  Daniel Craig has managed to maintain this throughout all of his Bond films.  The way they made the plot of Skyfall a bit old school I thought was brilliant.  It was refreshing to see Bond rely on resourcefulness and cunning to defeat the villain instead of loads of high-tech gadgetry.  It was also great to see Bond as a bit human.  Although I will miss Judy Dench as M, the way they made the transition from the old M to the new was also brilliant - especially their selection for the new M.  As a car guy, it was great to see the old DB-5 back in action!  And finally, they brought back Moneypenny - excellent!  If you are a Bond fan, I highly recommend seeing Skyfall.",1372896000,,739,4.304347826086956

I didn't like the song ""SKYFALL"" when I first heard it on the radio, but after watching the movie, I can see the connection and it was a great theme song for this movie.",1372896000,,345,3.9855072463768115

Solid plot, with the not totally unexpected exit of Judi Dench as ""M"".
Interesting ""teaser"" with Money-Penney in the shaving scene.
Definitely colder side of Bond being exposed as Daniel Craig continues to hone the character

5033530,5,B006X040NY,"I'm not going to bore people with a review of the movie.  You already know if you like it or not.  The choice here is whether to buy the Blu-Ray (BD) disc or the DVD.  I have seen both and both look really good.  The BD, of course, does provide more definition and a richer look.  The audio of the BD (separation and dynamic range) is, also, slightly superior to the DVD.  But that kind of performance should be expected from a BD.  Ultimately, both discs will provide an excellent viewing experience.

So, ""push comes to shove"", which to buy?  Buy a used BD copy (only ""very good"" or ""like new"") from Amazon.  I paid about $14.00 (with shipping) and got both the BD and DVD (one to share).  There is a ""digital copy"" but I never use it if access to it is still available.  The digital copy to download onto your computer or whatever can be time-sensitive.  (I have never understood the attraction of watching a movie on ones computer.)  Also, BDs have a coating on them that prevents the usual mars and scratches that can hamper a DVD.  So, chances are that you'll get a copy that will play just as well as a brand new disc.",1372291200,,1125,4.29047619047619

5033535,4,B006X040NY,"Very good on the whole , with some great action sequences . One thing you can say about the Craig movies is they keep a pretty good pace , there is not much to time to think or get bored. This can also be a negative however , as there is almost no time for any character development in the story . I do have some criticisms , so dropped one star. I thought Craig looked like he was kind of going through the motions in the beginning. Bardem had some good moments , but was not quite a believable character , more of a bad  caricature at times. I do believe this would be the perfect time for Craig to bow out , by the end of the movie , he looks about 50 yrs old! With a lot of the peripheral characters being changed , the next movie would be better with a new Bond definitely. Don't get me wrong Craig has made 3 very good Bond movies , but now we are getting into diminishing returns with him as Bond. TIME FOR A REBOOT!",1372204800,,923,3.935828877005348

Many reviews & people I talked to seem to agree that this was either the BEST Bond film or one of the greats in the series. I meant to watch it casually as I cleaned the house, while my husband mostly watched it. I was hooked, and sat down on the floor in front of the tv. I like a good action film, and this held my interest the whole time. The reason I didn't give it a 5th star is because I thought the villain could have been a little stronger/more intimidating. I feel like they didn't go deep enough into his psychosis, they just showed you some of it to make him a working character. SPOILER: a favorite character dies, and gets replaced, another memorable character's replacement is introduced, and we learn the name of another character from an older series film. Overall, I had a great time watching it, and would enjoy it again!",1372204800,,938,4.305084745762712

5033540,5,B006X040NY,This bond movie is awesome. I would have to say that this is one of the best in the series. is this the last one? if you watch very carefully at the end when the new m gives bond a folder it says dr. no on it for those who have not seen the movie sorry for giving that away but you might of missed it. I hope they don't remake dr. no that would be a terrible idea. I love the james bond films but I think they should let him rest. all good thing have to come to an end sometimes. but all in all this was a good installment to the series. but you never know with Hollywood. if they do make another I will definatly see it. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1372204800,,677,3.7412587412587412

I don't know who wrote it, produced it, or directed it.  And I don't care.  The raw material was there.  Daniel Craig has comported himself well through two previous Bond films, but this movie seemed determined to crush the Bond image into the ground.  I've recommended to my friends that they should definitely skip it.  I didn't even bother trading it in, I just threw it away.",1372118400,3,515,4.510869565217392

ALSO, BECAUSE HE'S SUCH AN ACTION FIGURE AND THINK MAYBE SOMETIMES HIS ACTING ABILITY IS OVERLOOKED.  HIS AC ACTING IS DEFINITELKY NOT BAD EITHER.  I LOVED THE SCORE SANG BY ADELE.  I'VE WATCHED THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER.  IT'S ALWAYS JUST AS EXCITING AS WHEN I WATCHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.  YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT TOO MANY MOVIES.

I was not impressed with the price for HD on this, $5.99 or a dollar less for the standard definition version.  But I went ahead with paying more for HD for the quality.  I could have saved my dollar.  After about 15 minutes of HD or near HD quality (not as good as Bluray) - the system stalled, then kicked into standard definition.  My Internet typically comes in around 27mbit, so even on a bad day, it should be able to handle streaming video.  I restarted the video, hoping to get a better Amazon connection.  After five minutes, it happened again.  I was using an Xbox for playback.  I usually don't have any issues on the Xbox, unlike my Blu-ray player where Amazon stalls frequently.  I am also a Netflix customer and have little or no issues with HD video streaming there on these devices.  Amazon needs to work harder to keep up with video demand.  To pay extra for HD video streaming and only get SD quality because the lines are busy is very disappointing.  The movie itself was quite good, but next time I'll get a Redbox Blu-ray disc - cheaper and better.

He is hit with a depleted uranium round and has fragments just under the skin that he removes months later on a whim. The bad guy has the info and only releases 5 names at a time and everyone assumes that he has not trafficked the names secretly to anyone else.  The bad guy's years in the planning scheme involves rigging the underground with explosives that he detonates just as Bond has him cornered and just as a train is right above him, hacking MI6, and culminates in him trying to bring down M and the government by bursting into a meeting armed with a hand gun.

5033570,5,B006X040NY,"In Casino Royale, Bond is new to spycraft and is expertly played by Vesper Lynd. Having set up Bond as a maladjusted youth and coldblooded adult the inference is that for him this is a rare connection in his life. Having been betrayed on multiple levels, Quantum of Solace is a twisted film wherein the organization that dominated Vesper into her actions is taken down piece by piece: you're never quite sure how much is revenge for her or against her. In the opening minutes Bond frankly states that he has no friends.

In this film Bond has apparently continued to be a tactical asset as his purpose in life. When a risky action is sanctioned to take out an enemy of the state Bond is sent into the depths to heal and take a look at his life. Upon his return we see the beginning of the distance the character is famous for: the quick wit and black humor comes from a sense of worthlessness and betrayal by everyone around him. Unable to drop his guard and isolated, we see a man who does attempt to connect with others on the only level he believes he has. His existence outside the system in his professional life transgresses into the personal.

By the end of the film Bond has survived most everyone he entered into the life with: and like the postmodern world he represents continues on a journey with no apparent destination.",1371600000,,1333,4.481481481481482

5033574,1,B006X040NY,"This film was a disappointment and it really shows as a product of its time. The problem for Cdr Bond and his colleagues is that there is no natural enemy, the Soviet Union is long gone. The film opens in Turkey with a rather inexplicable series of action scenes after someone dies in a flat. There is no obvious reason to put so many innocent bystanders at risk, and the film makes it hard to sympathise with Bond and his fellow bureaucrats, who seem to regard themselves as above the law, as you might if Bond were real.

The rather mysterious villain turns out to be a psycho-babbling Spanish-accented villain with a Portuguese name with a childish grudge. He has no clear means of support, and operates remarkably freely given his past, but his actions seem pitiful rather than threatening. The film also has a bizarre theme of MI6 struggling to argue for its budget with daft scenes involving a committee of politicians. Bond's main task seems to be to protect his employer's budget from 'cuts', which is a rather precious approach, even if it might be true to life.

The film has Bond retreating to his ancestral home in Scotland, not to find a lost Scottish accent. Bizarrely, he has virtually no back-up to help him, and his ancestral home has, for unexplained reasons, a Priest Hole, which is a purely English phenomenon, not a Scottish one.

There is a nod in the film to the unsavoury people trading in Macau, but at one point you might wonder if the femme fatale is going to turn out to be a Ladyboy.

Overall, the plot is weak, the action scenes formulaic, the whole film feels as if it was written by a committee appointed by the BBC.",1371513600,7,1648,4.538720538720539

Moneypenny accidently shoots Bond in the upper chest with a high powered rifle , he falls a hundred feet into an ice cold river, is last seen descending 15 feet below the surface, unconscious with nobody any where near him. Bond inexplicably survives and to be politically correct, sharpshooter Moneypenny is promoted so they can track down Javier Bardem`s over the top effeminate villan. Lucky for Bond, who looks and acts washed up, he doesn`t have to face Bardem`s far more menacing character Anton, from No Country for Old Men.

To be honest, the locations are a little spurious in this film - Istanbul, Shanghai, Macau; the Istanbul scenes, in particular, seem orientalist in conception (after two decades of living in the Republic of Turkey), I've yet to find scenes of daily life with the continual strains of the muezzin in the background accompanied by arabesk music).  However the film is redeemed by a close focus on characterization: we learn a lot about Bond's relationship to M (Judi Dench), and how the bad guy (Javier Bardem) finds that he has no choice other than to kill her.  There's also some interesting material on the nature of family: M is considered a 'mother-figure' within the British Secret Service, suggesting that work and leisure are inextricable.  Daniel Craig is a rugged Bond, making no secret of his advancing years: the film has an interesting side-line, as it speculates on whether spying these days is a young person's game.

5033612,4,B006X040NY,"""Skyfall"" was one of the rare times that I went to see a Bond movie in a theater, last autumn. I loved it for several reasons. As always, Bond movies provide exceptional escapism. But I also enjoyed watching Daniel Craig really warm to the role. (There was absolutely nothing wrong with his previous performances but in ""Skyfall"" he really was Bond.) Javier Bardem was marvelously creepy and Judy Densch, proficient and dependable as ever. The special effects worked well and the action was blistering.

In the theater, however, the sound quality was muddied, and there were snippets of dialogue that I plain missed. The DVD cleaned up a lot of this muddiness. And in the theater I never appreciated Thomas Newman's edgy and sometimes, haunting, soundtrack. Just beautiful!

I still have one minor complaint about the film: there were some missed opportunities with the cast. When I see the names of Albert Finney or Ralph Fiennes appear in a movie's cast, my expectation antennae go berserk. Unfortunately, they are given such little screen time that I felt just a little cheated. Anybody could have played those roles. I can't really assign fault to anyone, and it didn't affect my overall rating of the film. It's just me.

One question: What was with the ""Transporter""-ish poster and cover designs? Couldn't they come up with something original for Bond's 50th birthday?",1370908800,,1374,4.991266375545852

And the villain this time (an excellent performance by Javier Bardem) is genuinely scary, and less unbelievably ambitious than most Bond villains: rather than wanting to take over the world, he has the more modest goal of merely destroying the British intelligence service. Sex and violence are of course part of the mix, but here they aren't gratuitous or graphic enough to put many people off. The characters of Bond and M are given more depth than usual by having to face the consequences of their own aging and the unresolved complexities of their relationship. The supporting performances are good-to-excellent, with Brnice Marlohe particularly memorable as a Bond girl who can actually act, giving a compelling performance as a dazzlingly beautiful woman barely suppressing her near-hysterical terror under a mask of sophisticated seductiveness. Many fans will also find it interesting that, though there is a new, genius-level Q, there is less emphasis on razzle-dazzle technical spy gear than usual. Indeed, one motif of the film is Bond's reverting to old fashioned kit like a pocket radio transmitter and a plain old automatic pistol. Technically, the film is of high excellence, and the DVD transfer (I'm speaking of the standard DVD by MGM, I haven't seen the Blu-Ray) awesomely vivid. All in all, I'd say five stars if you're a real Bond fan, three if you aren't, and four for the rest of us.",1370822400,,1676,5.054151624548736
5033616,5,B006X040NY,"Considering that the James Bond character has had so many movies (23 to be exactly said), once again Daniel Craig did a great job, compared to my all time favorite Sean Connery. Although  (for the 007-fans) you get a strong feeling that this is the end of the long living James Bond episodes. I miss them all.",1370822400,,309,4.421052631578948

5033620,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig makes for probably the most likable Bond ever, even more than his progenitor Sean Connery.  It's a bit long-in-the-tooth for the storyline and it lacks some of the sexy punch of previous Bond's (the leading sex-tress has a strange look, I think. Not exactly the usual drop-dead-gorgeous Bond-Girl type.)

After watching this you just can't help but ask the question:  How will the Bond series evolve from this?  I can't wait to find out.",1370736000,,450,4.881578947368421
5033621,5,B006X040NY,"The Bond films really jumped in quality with the reboot with Daniel Craig as Bond, and each one has gotten better.

Javier Bardem is one of the most sinister villains ever.",1370736000,,292,4.528301886792453
5033622,2,B006X040NY,"I'll keep it short because it'll get buried beneath all the other reviews, but here goes - Skyfall isn't a bad movie, persay. But like the world it portrays - one where the terrorist genre is changing, lurking in the ""shadows"" - Skyfall doesn't do anything interesting in its act of revisiting a classic genre. The fighting scenes are sparse and uninteresting, the romance quick and bland (without spoiling it, it jumps in to the film as suddenly as it exists), and the ""bad guy,"" as it was, could not have been any more useless.

Its cardinal sin is that it tells, not shows - it tells you the villain is scary, that Bond is amazing, that the world is changing. But the villain does all of his activities either before the film starts or off-screen, Bond's personality is a hundred times more muted than his Casino Royale self, and the world is just gunshots and accidental victories. If it could prove to us that its core premise was worth believing, this movie would get more than two stars. As it stands, I'm not entirely sure I'm not being generous.",1370736000,,1054,4.5473684210526315

5033628,5,B006X040NY,"I was disappointed that I didn't get to see this one in theaters. However, watching it on my laptop brought the same intensity that I was hoping for. This movie was a true thriller. Many of the fight/chase scenes lasted for ten fifteen minutes and truly evoked that 'on-edge' feeling that you get when you almost feel that you are in the movie yourself. When Bond gets hit, you grimace; When he goes for some ridiculous stunt, you clench your fists and scoot to the edge of your seat; and when the scene finally comes to an end, you let out a sigh and feel your heartbeat slowly return to normal.
I would definitely recommend this one to other Bond fans. If you're like me and you're always up for a good action thriller, this one is sure to please.",1370736000,,749,4.357142857142857

5033635,4,B006X040NY,A fantastic film that is packed with action.  007 is faced with a few new circumstances we have rarely seen him in and we are reintroduced to the series as new actors take on the characters we have come to know and love.  A great film.,1370649600,,235,4.086956521739131
5033636,1,B006X040NY,"This film was bad.  Who are these people giving this movie 5 stars?  They certainly aren't Bond aficionados.  Bond films have a familiar and much-loved pattern that gives them their cult following.  We know we will see a handsome, debonair James Bond along with clever gadgets, clever dialogue, fast cars and fast-paced plots set to the great original music accompanied by beautiful Bond girls. This film had none of these.

I have loved all the Bond actors...however,not so much the Roger Moore films because they made him foolish.  I even liked Daniel Craig at first, but his last two films were sadly lacking.  Who writes these movies?  A bunch of 7th Graders?  Why wreck the wonderful character of James Bond?  Invent a new character and make him say and do stupid things.

Hollywood isn't very good at coming up with anything original...everything is a re-make.  Take someone else's good idea and ruin it with poor writing, casting and directing so you can say you made a movie.
I keep hoping that the next installment will bring us back to the authentic James Bond...but I'm beginning to worry...I think it might be too late.",1370563200,9,1131,4.803108808290156

I was a Pierce Brosnan fan who found Daniel a bit too tough in the role (maybe more realistic as an agent, but I really liked Pierce's suave charm).  This is certainly the best of Daniel's movies as James Bond, and perhaps one of the best James Bond movies ever.  Perhaps the ""psychological"" component to Javier Bardem's villain was appealing to me.

5033646,5,B006X040NY,"James Bond, for many of us, has been an amazing run that began with fifteen novels by Ian Fleming and today represents a fifty-year old film series with twenty-three official films.

History tells us fans that the beginning of each adventure will set the stage and mood of the tale.  Skyfall continues this tradition in a grand scale when 007 has a mission go wrong in Istanbul.  The carnage to elements of transportation and people prior to the opening credits is amazing.

Skyfall has been long awaited  being held hostage by MGM's financial problems.  The wait was worth it as Daniel Craig (007), Judi Dench (M), and Javier Bardem (the bad guy) deliver a believable threat to the MI-6 of the twenty-first century.

Internationally set, this cast and crew racked up quite a few air miles with filming in Turkey, China, Japan, London, and Scotland.  Even though it is the second longest Bond film (143 minutes running time), Skyfall never bogged down and rarely allowed us to catch our breath.  It feels like it belongs with the great and classic Bond flicks:  exciting, personal, intense, and beautifully made.  It had everything I needed to satisfy my appetite for more 007.",1370476800,,1177,4.835

However, COME THE HECK ON!  Just because some Bond films in the past took some creative license with reason doesn't mean that every new Bond film has a blank check to go throw common sense to the wind.

That being said, here we go:

1.  When Bond smashes the back end of the train with the back hoe, why doesn't the train stop?  If the back of a passenger car gets torn off, wouldn't the conductor stop the train?

2.  Bond gets shot off the top of the train and plummets hundreds of feet into a river.  He goes over a waterfall and appears dead.  Well, the next thing we know he is hanging out in a beach hut with a woman, obviously healed from his injuries.  Ahhh.... Ok... how did he get there?  How did he heal?  How long was he there?  What the heck happened?

3.  The bad guy is trying to kill M, right?  So when he blows up part of the MI6 building, why doesn't he do it when she is there?  Why doesn't he wait until she is in the office?  What possible reason does he have to blow up her office while she isn't there?

4. In Shanghai, Bond tracks down the sniper guy, gets in a struggle, and the sniper guy falls from the open window to his death.  Bond then looks at the sniper's equipment and finds a casino token inside the window cutting kit.  Uhhhh...ok... why was the token in the window cutting kit?  It wasn't just in there either... it looked like there was a special round spot for it.  How many window cutting kits do you know of that include special spots for casino tokens?  Also, is that where you would leave your assassination payment casino token?  How about back in a safe somewhere?  How about in your pocket?  Why would you have a special spot in your window cutting kit for it?

5.  The dumbest thing about this movie in the entire plot surrounding how the bad guy plans to kill M.  Apparently, the whole scheme is that he allows himself to get captured... so he can escape... so he can track her down in London and kill her.  Yeah - except it makes zero sense.

First of all, as mentioned above, the guy could have just killed her by blowing her office up.  Done.

Well that didn't happen, so he gets captured and put into a holding cell that looks like a prison for Magneto out of the X-Men.  However, unbeknownst to MI6, bad guy has some sort of intrusive virus on his computer that will infect the network once they try to analyze his computer.  What does this nefarious virus do?  It opens doors (ie, so he can escape).  Ok... so this is stupid on so many levels it is hard to summarize.  Just a few thoughts:  If the bad guy was so smart, why didn't he put a bigger, badder virus on the computer?  Why just something to open doors?  And how did he know how MI6 would hold him?  What if they had used an old fashioned metal bars cell?  After all, they are going old school and hiding in an underground bunker, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to put him in an old-style cell too?  And are we supposed to believe that the bad guy's entire plan revolved around getting out of his cage after the computer virus infected the network given the fact that he had no way of knowing where he would be kept and how he would be kept?  Also, did he know that there would be a convenient escape hole located in the floor right next to his cell?

You see, the whole idea that he planned this in advance is ludicrous.

Then we get in the underground where Bond shoots at bad guy while he is climbing a ladder.  Lucky for bad guy he planted explosives in the ceiling... right under the tube so a subway train comes crashing through the roof.  Huh?  Did bad guy know in advance that this is the escape path he would take?  Did he know Bond would catch him at just this spot?  Did he have a train schedule so he knew just the right time to blow the whole so a train would crash through?  Again - completely stupid.

Bad guy also has operatives helping him.  A couple guys give him some sort of police outfit to wear that looks just like other police guys in the subway station.  Yeah - because this was all figured out in advance because bad guy knew exactly where he would be held, the type of cell, the fact that it would be next to an escape whole in the floor, and that he would have to go through a tube station on the way out.  Right.

Want to get even dumber?  Here it goes.  This whole scheme depends on him knowing exactly where M is, right?  The escape route, the pick-up cars, the uniforms, everything.  It is all set up to get him to where she was testifying.  Ok, so let's skip back.  Bad guy wanted to be captured in order to execute this plot.  Therefore, this was thought out well in advance.  Did M have this appointment on her calendar while this was being planned?

You see... the entire scheme is senseless.  Since bad guy couldn't predict where and how he would be held, and where M was (or would be), there is no way he could have planned the escape route and coordinated the package exchange with the uniform and the pick-up car.  No way.

6.  Well, it gets worse.  What is Bond's big plan to protect M?  Take her up to his family home (Skyfall) in Scotland.  Who does he take with him for additional protection?  No one.  The only other person they have to help is some old groundkeeper who apparently lives up there and takes care of the place... but Bond wasn't expecting him to be there.  So Bond's whole plan is to drive up there with her and fight it out by himself.  That's it.  No extra guards even though this is MI6.  No extra weapons.  No extra help of any kind... not even a sneaky attack helicopter hiding over a hill.  Nothing.  This is the plan.  Brilliant.

So the bad guys come and get killed by a bunch of traps and some trickery.  Ok fine.  But then why does Bond fire at the helicopter when it shows up with more bad guys?  Huh?  Why would the crew of the chopper assume that the first wave had lost?  Wouldn't they just land and back-up the first team?  By firing on the chopper, Bond just lets them know that the first team failed and that they are still alive.  Again, completely stupid.

And how does the groundskeeper turn into such a moron after the escape through the tunnel.  They are smart enough to trap the house, but then they escape and the first thing he does is start waving a flashlight all over the place?  Are you kidding me?  Then, of course, bad guy see the flashlight and is like, ""Ah ha"" there they are... and off he goes a  chasing them.

I could write a lot more and get into a heck of a lot more detail, but I have to draw the line on the main points.  I've said it before and I'm saying it again... doesn't anyone in these production meetings step up and say, ""uuuhhh... that doesn't make any sense...""  At the most basic level with this film... if someone destroys half a passenger car on a train, that train is going to stop.  Period. What, no one could figure out that the train lost several cars and the back end of a passenger car was ripped open?  And on a more detailed level, no one asked about bad guys plot to get captured and mentioned that the entire string of events was ridiculous?",1369785600,39,7469,4.211048158640226

5033692,2,B006X040NY,"This movie is sad. The first 10 minutes of action clip felt like an afterthought, and it does not change the overall pace of the movie, it's slow, boring, and just plain dull. This is another movie you want to walk away after the first 10 minutes, not really a James Bond movie one expects. It's over hyped.

He reminds me of an ex-bantam weight boxer, with very little (if any) of the panache and style displayed by Sean Connery and Roger Moore in their renditions of 007. The movie itself left quite a bit to be desired as well. I'm guessing the masses would probably be satisfied though.

'hard to put my finger on it..but ""Bonds"" used to be more fun than serious. A little preposterous is good (but not insanely so like the dreadful Pierce Brosnan episodes.) Perhaps too the first Daniel Craig Bond movie set the action/adventure bar just too high.

I think Daniel Craig is incredible as Bond.  More true to Bond of the novel and Shaun Connery.  I can only hope we see many more Craig/Bond movies.

And I felt like the action scenes were placed there to call the movie an action movie, but it did not really show relevance.
To be direct, this movie is like listening to a grand orchestra play without its conductor.
The theme song, on the other hand, is one of the best ever. And Daniel Craig is a good actor, too. He deserves more than this poorly conceptualized project.",1369699200,2,543,4.333333333333333

Sean is now my second favorite after Skyfall convinced me daniel craig now has taken the James Bond legacy to a new level.  Gritty, physical, and fast paced it is a true 007 flick.  While it has a couple of gadgets one of the points of the movie is to point out not to rely too much on technology and the new Q points out that a trigger has to be pulled every now and then.  While Craig is no spring chicken he keeps himself in amazing shape and I understand he may be booked as Bond for the next 10 years.  Nice work if you can get it.",1369699200,,597,3.941666666666667

If one is pretty much on the edge of the seat most of the time and marveling at the imagination of the chase scenes, then the movie is pretty much a success and thus I think Skyfall is one.  I think I will enjoy watching this movie a number of times.

Why just 4 stars?  Because an action movie, in my view, will never deserve 5 stars because a 5-star movie is one that tells us something important about ourselves and that is not a Bond movie priority.  I would give 5 stars to a movie like To Kill a Mockingbird.",1369612800,,669,4.076335877862595

5033731,5,B006X040NY,"To begin, I will say that this is alike no other Bond film yet. It starts off with a well played action scene, and holds this action and excitement for the better part of the movie.
The director saw fit to add in some different film styles throughout, including silhouette fights atop towers and vast character portrayals in archirval types. The villain in this movie is truly an archetype, being evil, intelligent, and foreplanning for any possible move. Javier was an excellent choice to play the villain, due to his ability to undertake extremely dark and varying roles.
Daniel Craig does a great job playing Bond in this film and even stretches the role a bit in parts past what any other Bond has done yet. Skyfall takes the Bond role to a different part, moving from secret missions and intelligence gatherings to a barricade in James' old house growing up and exotic islands.
Do I recommend this film? Absolutely. Skyfall has something for just about everyone. Bond has truly met a worthy adversary in this film, thanks to great writing.
The only downfall to this was the somewhat anti-climactic ending. I felt the (spoiler!) bad guy died much too quickly, excluding some type of struggle or fight to the death, characteristic of almost every Bond film in history.

5033737,5,B006X040NY,"We have here, at last, a Bond film that dares to be more. In 50 years, we've learned next to nothing about James Bond's history, not much about his relationship with M, or, for that matter, that much about her. But this film really delivers.

The story centers around a washed-up Bond, who, after a spectacular opening sequence, is missing, believed killed. But once a cyberattack strikes at the heart of the Secret Service, Bond returns from the shadows, and M, despite her better judgment, sends Bond back into the field. Along the way, we encounter a villain who is the man M made him, a ghost from her past, and the unexpected consequence of making the hard decisions.

Sam Mendes, who introduced Daniel Craig to American audiences in ""Road to Perdition,"" moves the story along at breakneck speed, but he's smart enough to know when to slow it down so we can catch a breath. Roger Deakins' cinematography is top notch, and should have won the Oscar. Thomas Newman's score is a marvel, showing an understanding of the Bond films' history, appropriate nods to John Barry, and a Newman Hollywood pedigree is used to the full.

Both Daniel Craig and Judi Dench bring all their powers to their respective roles. Craig has given us the character Fleming created at the opening of his novel ""Thunderball,"" in which Bond has become a borderline alcoholic who just doesn't care anymore. In Craig, we have a Bond who looks like he's lived the Bond lifestyle. Dench is a marvel, a lioness fighting for her career and the lives of the agents under her care. If anyone would ever have won an acting award for a James Bond film, it would have been Dench.

Watching this movie melted 40 years away and I was 15 again, thrilling to every frame, feeling every bit of the roller coaster ride that the best Bond films are. This ranks with ""From Russia, With Love."" Don't miss it.

its more like the writer's jumped a loooong time into the future (from quantum of solace) and bond is kind of an old dude now.

which is weird cause even with the scruff he sports for most of this movie, daniel craig just doesn't look that old.

Even though Daniel Craig is in awesome physical condition, the human body cannot take such punishment and still perform at such high levels.  I also thought that the spy trade-craft was often unrealistic.

The British sense of humor, thrill action sequence, and beautiful women. James Bond's is a well known character. His mission is to save the world and this film has brought entertainment to audience at all age level before Daniel Craig's time. When producer Albert Broccoli, Harry Salizman, and director Terence Young created James Bond's character (based on Ian Flemings's novel) back to the early 60's, they specifically designed Bond as a world hero and lady's man then the world has already embraced it. Now 50 years later, some lousy director and producer bought this franchise and ripped off the good image from what we had for James Bond. They made him a cold blood killer with very bad temper. Due to the reputation of all past James Bond films, people will take a risk to see this movie because they love the James Bond's character and hopefully his legacy will last forever...... Unfortunately this franchise is moving to the wrong direction and Daniel Craig should learn from his predecessors and apologize to loyal Bond's fans for what he has destroyed Bond's image and misinterpreted 007's immortal role in the heart of us who really follow / enjoy James Bond's films since Dr. No!!!",1368921600,7,1314,4.767543859649122

First lets talk about what i didn't care for with this movie, Some spoilers (((ALERT))) AGE: Daniel Craig still feels new to me as a Bond, and in this movie there are multiple references to him getting older and ""loosing a step"" I didn't care for this at all as i feel like we as the viewers are still getting to know Craig as Bond. #2 Gadgets: As a little boy (im 37 now) i remember watching Bond movies with my dad and the super cool gadgets are half of what made the movies, this movie he gets a pistol and a radio that frankly looked like it was out of a 70's bond movie.. & The Bond girl felt forced, like there was a requirement to have a bond girl so they made a spot for her and she lasted all of 5 minutes in the movie.. And the Villion.. a X double 00 agent, I wish we had more information on him and his back story as well, its hardly mentioned.  I feel like Casino was a great start, quantum tied up the loose ends of Cassino and we were seeing the new James Bond come into his own as a newly promoted 00 agent, then in Skyfall he's portrayed as the aging, not truly up to the task anymore agent.. I feel like a movie or 3 were skipped.

The Good: I loved that they threw the old Aston Marton in this movie, I truly like that this movie had some Humor to it and it wasn't so dark like Quantum, I also truly loved the old train station becoming the new MI6. Our meeting Money Penny and getting her ""field"" back story was very ,very cool.  After watching this movie 5-6 times now i understand what the writer/director was doing and i respect it.. I like the movie, i just think they could have done it a little better in the mentioned area's.",1368748800,,1885,4.021333333333334

In my mind, that is just wrong. IMHO, this forum is for reviews of the de facto film, video quality, cinematography, acting....

So, on to the film. My favorite ""Bond"" of all time has been Connery. I loved his portrayal of Bond, just seemed perfect for the part. However, Craig is challenging that. He plays such a damn good Bond it is really hard for me to not acknowledge that he may the best 007 to date. (Of course he benefits from more modern production, effects, financing, and other factors.) Craig play a superb Bond in ""Skyfall"", a Bond movie that I rate at the very top tier of all Bond movies. For me, the overall movie maintains the character of the Bond franchise while injecting some new elements. Listen - the plot is pretty standard Bond stuff; Bond and / or Bond's colleagues are victims of some fiend, capture / revenge of said fiend is sought, evil and somewhat crazy antagonist enters the scene and nearly destroys either Mi6, the world, or the moon, but in the end - Bond triumphs over aforementioned fiend. What I thought made this movie carry the standard plot through very well were -

- Daniel Craig's character
- Judy Dench's character
- Decent action without going over the top
- Great scenery, (landscapes and females)
- Ralph Fiennes entrance as Ems replacement
- Whoever the dude was that played ""Q"" was pretty decent for the character
- Javier Bardem always plays a great creep - (No Country For Old Men - wow!)
- Naomi Harris
- That girl. You know which one I'm talking about, in the casino and later with the Whiskey glass on her head. Yeah - that one...
- The movie has an ""Atmosphere"" to it. (For an atmospheric movie, check out Heat -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat/dp/B002AH3WSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat</a>)

So, I am a fan of the current Bond franchise and will follow the future closely. (I was not so crazy about the last movie. That, my friends, is another story...)

For all of the above reason, I recommend this movie. The quick review - THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE AND YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE IT.

Now - the crap. I was forced to sit through many (seemed like about 20) promotions and previews before the movie. The problem is that these anal orifices (is that right for plural or is it orifi?) at MGM have decided that we cannot just buy a movie for 20 beans. We get the added bonus of watching promotions for other MGM stuff we do not necessarily want! Shame on you MGM! I will hesitate to purchase future MGM releases.",1368662400,,2669,4.634249471458774

Daniel Craig is finally back in the expensive suits for his third run as the iconic James Bond. The stakes are high and the super spys very existence is examined in this worthy entry to the franchise on its 50th anniversary.

Director Sam Mendes wastes no time jumping straight into the action as Bond and Eve (Naomie Harris), another field agent, are tracking down a missing hard drive. M (Judi Dench) is forced to make one of the toughest calls of her career leaving Bond incapacitated. The script drops the ball on Bonds return to the world of the living and the details are merely glossed over, but non-existent. When MI6 is directly threatened through terrorist acts, Bond brings himself back to active duty. In trying to discover who is committing the terrorist acts against his agency Bond has the pleasure of running into Severine (Berenice Marlohe). Severine is Bonds link to Silva but the character doesnt have much purpose beyond being a bridge and is incredibly underdeveloped. Silva (Javier Bardem) is the greatest Bond villain in recent memory. He is smart, powerful, and funny while simultaneously being creepy, threatening and emotionally disturbed. Silva has a personal grudge against MI6 and using his vast well of internal knowledge tests Bonds dedication to M.

A big part of Skyfall is the question of someone like James Bond still being relevant in a digital world. This is an especially interesting question to ask on Bonds 50th anniversary as well as Daniel Craigs return to the character after a lackluster second film and an extended break due to MGMs financial woes. Q (Ben Whishaw) summarizes these exact thoughts to Bond in a very well written scene that speaks directly to the audience without being blatant exposition. Unfortunately the question of Bonds irrelevance and his triumph in proving otherwise isn't fully explored and the notion is essentially ignored by everyone involved except newcomer Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). Mallory is the British Governments answer to M after the aging director failed in recovering the crucial hard drive Bond was hunting when he was injured.

The script for Skyfall pursues many interesting angles for an action franchise. Unfortunately Mendes leaves a lot of threads hanging on some of these subplots. Skyfall does something that the Bond series has needed for a while, it begins to explore who James Bond actually is as a man. Since he is not someone whose origin story needs to be shrouded it is surprising that this character could have such an impact on pop culture without his past being well known cannon. Exploring Bond as a man is great for breathing new life into the franchise and would have been absolutely perfect in 2006s Casino Royale. The concepts are not wasted on Skyfall but the subplot is not fleshed out fully. The question of old fashioned ways in comparison to the amazing technology that world governments now posses is another brilliant concept in the script. However when it comes down to the finished film Mendes again fails to fully deliver to the audience. There is never a moment of doubt in Bonds capabilities or a major triumph moment for the character where technology is proven to not be able to do everything a thinking man in the field can do. The subplot merely tells the audience that times have changed in the 50 years since Bond began entertaining us and that goes without say.

Craig embodies the character he re-created in Casino Royale and this version of Bond lands somewhere between his Royale and Solace roles. In Royale Bond was as charming as he could ever be and the most physically impressive Bond ever. Solace was a much darker story where Bond was only motivated by hatred and revenge. Skyfall strikes a nice balance where the spy can turn on his charm when needed, even directing it towards a man at one point, and despite some bodily harm is still fit and up to the physical tasks that Silva throws at him. M plays the same role she has with little variation. Dench is not a physically dominating woman but when she is playing M it is clear that she is a character you don't want to cross. Mallory and Eve are both newcomers to the Daniel Craig Bond franchise but both characters are played so magnificently its a shame they couldn't get more screen time. Mallory seems almost villainous since he is introduced as damage control to a botched operation but he is likable and a man just doing his job in the most sensible and real way possible. He proves his worth in a few pivotal moments and definitely wins over the audience with ease. More of Eve and Bond working in the field would have been nice to see. The script doesnt short the audience on the interactions between the two characters but they play off each other so smoothly that an entire movie could be built around their working relationship. The true stand out performance of the Bond film is in the villain. Villains are often allowed to be larger than life while the heroes have to remain relate-able to the audience and Silva is no exception. A strange look to a strange man Silva seems very happy and confident in his work. At the flip of a switch he can change the mood of the entire scene and really make the audience feel for him. A sympathetic villain that can remain terrifying is not an easy feat but Bardem nails it.

Despite some minor pacing issues and a couple sub-plots that needed a bit of grooming Skyfall is a great action movie with a lot to offer fans of James Bond and action movies alike. To answer the main questioned poised by the movie, Skyfall tells us that James Bond is up to the challenge and here to stay.",1368489600,,5638,4.7187817258883245

I was sad to see Judi Dench leave, but Ralph Fiennes as ""M"" going forward will also keep the Bond brand fresh along with Naomie Harris as the new ""Moneypenny"".

5033812,5,B006X040NY,"James Bond is misogynist and heteronormative.
Layered with racial and class stereotypes.
Skyfall is neither cleverer nor more sophisticated than its predecessors.

And so on and so forth!

Q: Age is no guarantee of efficiency.
Bond: And youth is no guarantee of innovation.
Q: Well, I'll hazard, I can do more damage on my laptop sitting in my pajamas before my first cup of Earl Grey than you can do in a year in the field.
Bond: Oh, so why do you need me?
Q: Every now and then a trigger has to be pulled.
Bond: Or not pulled. It's hard to know which in your pajamas.

I can recommend Roger Ebert's review  ... I don't know what I expected in Bond No. 23, but certainly not an experience this invigorating...

Exactly.

Skyfall is an exhilarating combination of new and old which remakes the franchise while somehow coming full circle and putting Bond back where he began proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks.

I thoroughly enjoyed the way Bond and M had to battle suggestions of both people and institutions being ""too old"" and ""outdated."" M's speech quoting Tennyson is nothing short of genius and it captures exactly the uncertainties of our age.

Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

The movie is unashamedly positive about the necessity of defending and loving Britain. This is a Bond movie you should see if you have the slightest interest in the franchise. And if you do not, perhaps you will enjoy the soundtrack.",1368316800,,1672,4.509933774834437

The action is well done and even the scenes that don't have are beautiful to look at. I loved how he used blue, gray and other somber colors in certain scenes.

A solid script really builds a good foundation for film and Skyfall had one. It was more personal when it came to Bond and M. Their storyline and Silva's had me fully engaged. There some bits of humor that I liked. I also enjoyed them reintroducing characters that we hadn't seen in Craig's Bond yet.

The cast really brought their A game and Craig really showed different sides to Bond that didn't I expect. Judi Dench was a gem. Bardem was a truly sick and kind of sad SOB. There should have been more Naomie Harris and Q. Although there wasn't much to Berenice Marlohe's character, she still did fine with it.

5033846,5,B006X040NY,"As a Bond fan, this has been the best Bond movie yet.  Sure Connery did a great job given the technology, script writing and so forth back then.  But Daniel Craig is today's Bond and Skyfall brings the edginess that movie-goers want (I was not a fan of Roger Moore's campy portrayal of the character).  Ticket sales for this movie proves the point.  What I like about Craig's portrayal is while in real life James Bond would never be accepted by such an agency (they don't much go for the 'lone wolf' types), Craig makes the character more believable mostly because he's rather plain looking and not as strikingly handsome as Ian Fleming depicted.  And in the Intelligence community, ""plain"" is good.  Moreover, what I enjoy most about Craig's work is that he conveys a world of emotions with his facial expressions and gestures - watch Casino Royale again after the fight scene when he's in the restroom trying to stop the bleeding.  Craig's facial twitches and gestures makes one feel the pain he is suffering.  But I digress...

What I like about this set aside from the behind the scene extras is the digital copy that I can play on my computer.

You keep watching this movie hoping that it will be great and it isnt.

The first couple of hours:) of the movie have some interesting and riveting special effects moments.....There is also a nice vintage feel to the movie that harkens back to the best of the Connery ""Bond"", and the choice for the evil foe was inspired.. The other nice touches would be the time spent creating genuine heat and chemistry between Bond and his pretty ""ladies""....Much attention was given to this, and it worked, and also adding Ben Whisaw as ""Q"" is a spectacular choice.
Ben Whisaw is one of the best actors around and he elevates any role he is given, including ""Q"".
If you've not seen him in ""Bright Star"" then you are missing something wonderful.
It was also nice to see Albert Finney once again all dressed up and grinning like some Charles Dicken's character.
The biggest downside of the movie was the fire-worked and cliched ending, which included finding myself yawning during the last 20 mins.
Im not big on huge and endless fires in movies as a way to burn up 25 mins of nothing in the script.,and a whole lot of burning up goes on in this Bond the last 30 mins.
The continual Achilles heel regarding this movie was a bit of focus lack in the script and the fact that the ending was extremely anti-climatic.
The ending is frankly not well written.
Yes, overall its slightly better then the last Bond movie, but as compared to Casino Royale, it just does not have any big money to place on the table.
The Daniel Craig ""Bond"" series made a huge mistake when they killed Eva Green in Casino Royale as she really made that movie click.....They should have let her live and brought her back at some point, and now that they have also killed off the superb Judi Dench ""M"" character, the last of the special magic that was left of Daniel Craig Bond series has forever vanished.",1367798400,,2008,4.471389645776567
5033869,5,B006X040NY,Daniel Craig did a great job as 007 as an older spy.  I liked the story line but was sad at the end. I'll let you see and decide if you agree.,1367798400,,142,3.4375

5033876,4,B006X040NY,"Of all the movie Bonds, Daniel Craig's version is most like the character Ian Fleming created for his books - very capable, very grim,  humorless, and extremely dangerous.  Craig's movies are very good, but Sean Connery is still the favorite.",1367712000,,242,5.025

5033879,4,B006X040NY,"After 50 years of James Bond could there be any new surprises?  Skyfall provides a few.

In many ways Skyfall is about heritage.  James Bond comes full circle as glimpses of his childhood are revealed.

His relationship with M is explored aptly.  The connection between them is delicately demonstrated.

Of course you have the super intelligent baddie, Raoul Silva. This time he has a personal grudge to settle with M.

MI6, the British fortress of invincibility, suffers under his skillful hand.  Using Winston Churchill's WWII bunker as the new headquarters was a nice touch.

Of course you have exotic locales, beautiful women and music to set the tone of Skyfall.  All of these elements are part of the film series.

To many adding Q, the Quartermaster, as a young techie, was a delight.  Of course Moneypenny finally shows up in the Daniel Craig's James Bond's world.

The ending is emotional gripping.  James Bond and M face the ultimate challenge with tragic results. Skyfall is the childhood home of Bond where the ultimate, final battle takes place between the present and the past.

The old chapel on the estate is a fitting memorial as M comes face to face with her past and ""sins"", and Bond finally leaves his past, Skyfall, in ruins.  He closes the chapter on his childhood and the tragic loss of his parents and now M, who was like a mother.

This film, in many ways, reverberates back to the original concepts of the James Bond series.  The fate of M portrayed brilliantly by Judi Dench (1995-2012) is the saddest moment in this fine presentation, but all good things must come to an end.

The world today is much different from 1962 when Dr. No. first appeared on movie screens.  Commenting on the world today in Skyfall, M said,

""I'm frightened because our enemies are no longer known to us. They do not exist on a map. They're not nations, they're individuals. And look around you. Who do you fear? Can you see a face, a uniform, a flag? No! Our world is not more transparent now, it's more opaque! It's in the shadows. That's where we must do battle.""

Recent events testify that in the shadows individuals wait to bring fear and harm to the innocents.  Her words may be fictional, but they aptly describe our reality in 2013.",1367712000,,2246,4.659033078880407
5033880,4,B006X040NY,I really this yhis 007...Daniel Craig really seems to embody the Bond I first met in the Ian Fleming books so long ago. Not sure about Moneypenny. I guess we'll see.,1367712000,,165,4.354838709677419

I've seen it three times in total and this speaks volumes for the quality of the movie. The acting is superb, the plot excellent and the script amusing. This is a benchmark for movies of a similar genre and sets a very high standard. It benefits from being viewed on the big screen but a good home cinema set up will not leave the viewer wanting.

Many of the scenes were set pieces like the fight on top of a moving train which opens the film.  Can't these guys think of something original?  The women are gorgeous as usual, the music is pretty good, the plot forgettable as usual.  I guess this Bond is supposed to appeal to us old guys, since he is supposed to be losing his touch.

This is understandable, in view of this fifty year old film franchise recognizing the aging demographics of its audience.  It is a nice variation from the usual Bond motif, and unfortunately, one that likely strikes home for most of the audience.  The manic irrational antagonist with his single minded obsession oft reminds me of certain seller ratings obsessed vendors.  Nuff said.",1367539200,,478,4.9375

I saw what they did there, what they're setting the stage for going forward, but that doesn't excuse a humorless Bond movie where the legendary 007 is only a passenger in a car chase and the closest he gets to a woman is silhouetted in a shower. Tasteful? Of course, but not Bond. This re-branding is so serious and drastic that it doesn't fit well in the franchise and the consequences to key characters feels undeserved.

The movie itself is gorgeous, the sets & cinematography are top-notch, and Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are definitely at their best. It would have definitely earned a full four-stars if it was branded as a spy drama instead of the keynote of a 50-year legacy.",1367280000,,829,4.490066225165563

5033929,2,B006X040NY,"I've always been a fan of Bond films, although I've never found the more recent actors to live up to Sean Connery or Roger Moore as the character. Skyfall, like several of the other more recent Bond movies has become more of a bland action film than a classic Bond movie. I will admit that I enjoyed Casino Royale, but that was an exception. Skyfall begins with a rather formulaic car chase scene (yawn) and then transitions to an ultra-cheesy computer hacking plot (has anyone in Hollywood ever touched a real computer?) complete with absurd dialog made up of a random jumble of technical buzzwords. All of this wraps around a ridiculous plot twist and some rather bland drama and finishes up with a bunch of explosions. There was a distinct lack of cool spy gadgets, always a Bond staple, the sole exception being a silly smart-gun that Bond ends up throwing to a baddy instead of ever actually firing it. If you love a mindless action flick, you could certainly do worse, but this is definitely not in my list of favorite Bond films.",1367193600,,1036,4.605405405405405

5033940,5,B006X040NY,"I'll admit, I was as skeptical as the rest when Daniel Craig was announced as the next James Bond. He proved himself in Casino Royale, while the writing of Quantum of Solace let Bond fans down all over the world. With 2012 being the 50th anniversary of the James Bond movie franchise, Skyfall had to be big... and it was!

In Skyfall, the story ties together everything since the series reboot in Casino Royale and could easily be followed by Dr. No. Skyfall puts everything into place to set up for the Bond we all know and love, while making many witty references to Bond movies of old that a true fan will appreciate. References to the ejector seat from Goldfinger, exploding pens from Goldeneye, and who can forget the return of the DB5?

The movie was good enough to see twice on opening night, and was more than good enough to preorder on the Blu-Ray/DVD + Digital Copy. The Digital Copy allowed me to download through iTunes, and because of this the movie is a staple on my iPad Mini, so I can watch the movie any time I want on a flight across the country. The DVD/Blu-Ray live next to the DVD player in my living room for those nights a guy just needs to watch a good espionage movie.

This movie is a must-own in my book and I would rate higher if I could.",1367107200,,1266,4.310924369747899

5033947,4,B006X040NY,"Who'd have thought a new James Bond film could be good,hit all the buttons in term of story,villain,M, topicality,setting,even be able to look down on the Bourne franchise as a young pretender,that's lost its hero. Directed superbly by Sam Mendes,set chiefly in England( in the year of the Olympics and Daniel Craig's Bond dropping in to Buckingham Palace to pick up the Queen and parachute her in to stadium).In place of the Queen we have Judy Dench's M,treating her agents mean,keeping them keen,Bond's adoptive mother. Javier Bardem plays Raul Silva,the best Bond villain in ages,with the camp of a Hannibal Lecter crossed with Julian Assange,the blonde hair flopping,an agent turned rogue,involved in cyber-terrorism. Bond is shot by fellow agent Moneypenny(Harris),while trying to retrieve a stolen hard-drive containing the identities of Nato agents.

He returns from the dead ruggedly shaken(he fails the physical) to guard the woman who caused him to be shot. M herself is under scrutiny under pressure to resign from Mallory(Fiennes)after MI6 is bombed. M's antagonist Silva acts on matricidal emotions that Bond himself represses. This realism grounds the film,often mired in absurdity and fantasy, and the intelligence is upgraded. M quotes Tennyson's Ulysses. Bond meets geeky Q(Wishaw) in the National Gallery in front of Turner's The Fighting Temeraire,to draw a parallel between the scrapyard-bound warship and Bond's obsolescence. Casino Royale set the template of the new Craig Bond and would be hard to better,based as it was on the best Fleming novel. This is a great follow up on Bond's 50th anniversary.

There is an homoerotic scene between Bond and Silva which is highly comic. The Oedipal relationship with M is a new twist. M has an emotional power over her 00-agents,which accounts for the potency of the villain. Both have an emotional backstory with M.Is Dench the best Bond girl ever?The pre-credit sequence is a spectacular chase scene in Istanbul. Roger Deakins' cinematography has improved since the choppy Quantum of Solace with great action set pieces. The last part of the story is set in the Scottish Highlands and produces that brilliant character actor Albert Finney as Kincade,Bond's old gamekeeper. Bond takes M to his childhood home,booby-traps the house and takes on Silva's men when they arrive. There is a hint of sentimentality but charged with atmosphere and energy. One of the best Bonds with spectacular direction by Mendes.",1367107200,,2472,5.287531806615776

Otherwise a piece of junk, embarrassing on so many levels--the new Q character appeals to the 6 year olds in the audience, Javier Bardem appeals to no one but Javier Bardem, and perhaps his mother, and the nostalgic crutch of the Goldfinger car is just so so so sad.

Javier Bardem's acting skills could have made him one of the top Bond badies but plot holes and mediocre writing causes villain to never really come together. Judi Dench still cracks it as the best M ever, but she too gets burnt by the movie's general failing. Toward the end, I kept expecting one of these very talented actors to look at the camera and apologize. Worth watching but they really need to rethink Bond movie direction.",1367020800,,611,4.464285714285714

But Daniel Craig and the entire cast make this mournful, dark, and even humanized version of James Bond the best ever. Not only is there no silly and campy parts to this third Craig installment, it actually makes you FEEL like this Bond Movie deserved a Best Picture and Actor and Best Supporting Actress/Actor nod. It is right up there with LOTR, Return of the King. Oscar worthy, but it did not get the praise it deserved. This Bond will reboot the next generation of Bond lovers to go back to theaters, unless they have no pulse of course. Great movie and in Blu Ray it is stunning!",1366848000,,698,4.376923076923077

Daniel Craig does an excellent job of making Bond more human, more rough around the edges and the relationship between Bond and M is priceless. Finally, seeing the empty shell from which the young Bond emerged into the current 007 agent was so carefully constructed by the filmmakers and the scenery is incredible. You get a true sense of where Bond's loyalty to M has come from. Although the picture is rather dark, it is also beautiful in so many ways.",1366848000,,537,4.434343434343434

A compelling villain, albeit another agent gone bad (a la Goldeneye), but with a more personal agenda.  Some of the old fun of Bond is starting to creep back in at last, rather than just relying on fighting and chasing.  There's plenty of that but Mendes was able to provide visually compelling scenes.  I was surprised to find that the movie became part 3 of what has turned out to be a trilogy of rebooting the Bond franchise.  Casino Royale showed us Bond at the beginning of his career, just promoted to 00 status.  Quantum of Solace concluded that story.  I thought we'd be moving along.  Turns out, we were in for one more to re-establish the Bond universe.  Within the context of the story, it was done well.  I'm glad it wasn't the main theme.  I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, because it feels like Silva won and the entire point of the movie and protagonists was defeated.

Without giving it all away, there are some real changes here and some scenes that clearly lift or at least take their inspiration from other franchises (Bourne, Dark Knight). Kudos to the producers for not standing still. Some of the storyline defies common sense but that's never been a real problem for thrillers (does North by Northwest make any sense?) and for a franchise that once featured a Lotus Esprit submarine, this is as real as it gets. This picks up on the grittier tone of Casino Royale and all to the good. Ralph Fiennes is a fine addition and Javier Bardem seems to be having a great time. More to the point, there are real people whom we care about at risk here and that makes for a fine story, well played.",1366761600,,757,4.492753623188406

In the past we would go to see a Bond movie to watch a debonair, good looking guy get the girls with a flick of his finger, we would see him battle 500 of Spector's men and not mess up his hair. We couldn't wait for Q's new gadgets, everything was over the top, that was the essence of Bond.

We knew the man wasn't real, we knew the story was unbelievable, and we loved to see gadgets being used.  The women, the settings of the story and the fact that James Bond was invincible, these were the reasons we went to see a Bond movie.

SKYFALL is a good movie exciting and action packed but the fun is gone, it's as if Sid, James's brother leaves his job in the coal mines and pretends to be James while James is away on some island with a beautiful woman hiding for a few months from M.

5034058,2,B006X040NY,"This is the third of the new Bond movies, and my least favorite by far.  It lacks the usual warmth, humor and sex appeal of the Bond franchise.  It also lacks the star power of a criminal mastermind. There are no outstanding, memorable characters in this film at all.
The trend of making the Bond franchise completely sexless has continued.  The director made one half-hearted attempt at a sexy scene in a shower, but it was completely sanitized for your protection and over quicker than a Saturday night at the preacher's house.  It wouldn't even make a Quaker blush.  I guess it's ok to show a human body torn into pieces by bullets, but God forbid we should see a naked breast.
Also continued is the casting of no-names as supporting actors.  The only bright point in the movie is newcomer Naomie Harris as Moneypenny.  Unfortunately, the new Q is a pathetic and entirely forgettable little twerp, twice as arrogant but half as clever as he thinks he is.  He has all the appeal of wet cardboard and gets completely played by the villain.  Sadly, he survives.
The biggest villain in this movie is definitely the script.  The story started out strong but completely fell apart.  There were huge missed opportunities and holes in the plot.  For example, the villain went through years of planning just to show up at a conference with two buddies and a handgun?  That's the big climax?  No holding the world hostage, no WMDs?  Pretty pathetic.  When he escapes through the subway, the chase scene is a complete snore until Bond catches up.  But it would have been 1,000 times more impressive if the director had done the scene the same way they did the opening escape sequence of Indiana Jones running from the falling rock in the tomb in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It would have made a much bigger impact to see Bond running from a runaway train like that, instead of just a simple crash.  A wasted chance, if you ask me.
But the ultimate kiss of death for Skyfall was that there were far too many contrived scenes.  By the end it was obvious that everyone from the director to the screenwriter and even the actors were all just mailing it in.  In one example, the head of MI6 is under threat of terrorist attack, but they only assign one agent and one fat guy for her protection.  Then later, when the villain shows up for the final confrontation, he isn't eager to get in the house and kill... giving M enough time to escape and Bond enough time to plan a nasty surprise. I found myself wishing that they would just kill M already- the witch truly deserved it for betraying one of her agents, after all. But it got worse.  Take the scene when the villain caught Bond while running across a frozen pond covered with thin ice... What were the options?  One, you could just gun him down. Two, you could shoot the ice and send him into the frozen water to drown. So of course it's option three- one of the henchmen walks out onto the ice, close enough for Bond to grab his machine gun and shoot a hole in the ice and escape.  Everyone knows the best way to cover someone with an automatic weapon is from only inches away, after walking out onto thin ice.  That was just stupid.  Finally, Bond shows up to kill the villain by throwing a giant knife into his back, one that appeared mysteriously out of nowhere.  Perhaps the Lady in the Lake gave it to him when she rescued him from drowning, which is the only way anyone could have escaped death after falling into that frozen pond, BTW. I won't even mention the underwater struggle in which Bond choked his victim to death with his knee and still had breath enough to swim 25 feet up to the surface in sodden winter clothing...What is this, Harry Potter?
I certainly didn't find myself wishing I were in Bond's place after this movie, as I have done in the past.  There was no awe, no hero worship. But without the charm and the reckless savoir-faire made famous by the previous Bonds, you don't have a hero anymore.  All you have left is an annoying little prick-ly toad. That is my impression of Daniel Craig as Bond after this movie.  I won't be falling for anymore hype from this group.",1366416000,13,4137,4.468708388814913

On her Majesties Secret Service Bond who's name escapes me was awesome as well.  This new guy Daniel Craig is more like a Jason Borne character, but now that he's aging, he makes one fantastic Bond.  I loved this movie.  The next Bond should be the English accented guy currently playing opposite of Emily in the TV Series Revenge.  He will make a great Bond.

Adding to this is the satisfying introduction of some new and interesting imperfect-genius types who further the grounding of the story in something more human than the Bond films I remember from the past.  If there's anything to forgive, I'll say it's the whiff of melodrama that floats again in the air, this time around The Bad Guy.

I'm not going to spoil anything but there are more than a few surprises and endings for some people we've gotten to know in the other two films.  It is not as action packed as the previous two films, but this is still a 5 star film and I do encourage Daniel Craig Bond fans to get it.

This film just didn't have that many memorable action scenes, and now, nearly 2 weeks after watching, I just can't seem to remember any; however, I still easily recall action scenes from both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.  Skyfall is not a bad film, just not a great one.  I think it was worth adding it to my collection, if only to maintain the series' integrity.",1366243200,,586,4.5

5034095,2,B006X040NY,"If Bond isn't dead, maybe he should be which is how this installment starts out.  I swore I'd never watch another of the new generation Bond films after the bleak ""Quantum of Solace"".  However, I was lured back by the promise of a return to the ""old"" Bond style with ""Skyfall"" and when they rolled out the iconic Aston Martin DB5 from ""Goldfinger"" they had me.

The franchise is still broken, though this 007 adventure is the best of the three Daniel Craig films.  The new Bond still lacks the wit and humor of old, not a double entendre to be seen within miles of this script.  Not much of a story, the villain not too scary, virtually gadget-less (a PPK with palm print recognition and a not-so-small radio transmitter), and then there's the car.  The current franchise clearly hates the 007 cars; they were quickly destroyed in the beginning of the previous 2 stories.  This time when Bond rolls the DB5 out from a storage unit and you hear the Bond theme you're thinking good things are coming...then again, maybe not.  Other than joking with M and fiddling with the ejection seat switch and later deploying the bumper mounted machine guns against the bad guys (with the car parked) he merely takes M for a leisurely drive through the Scottish countryside.  Supposedly they're hiding from villain who's out to kill M but once the get to Bond's remote boyhood home they make no effort to conceal or camouflage the car and just leave it parked out front.  All manner of elaborate booby traps are made but they don't do anything with the car, I thought spies were all about deception?

Even my wife, who dislikes most of the Bond movies, loved SKYFALL.",1366243200,,312,4.396551724137931
5034104,5,B006X040NY,"After the lukewarm reception that Quantum of Solace received in 2008, where the James Bond films would go next was uncertain. That uncertainty was worsened when MGM found itself going into bankruptcy, delaying another film by years. The series though would rebound and a new Bond film was to be out in time for the series' fiftieth anniversary. Would this anniversary film, and twenty-third entry, be able to bring the series back on track?

The Craig era of Bond has been about developing Bond as a character and this film goes far in that direction. Taking cues from latter Ian Fleming Bond novels, Skyfall does exactly that. Craig's Bond in particular seems well suited to this as we see a Bond who, after being left for dead after a mission, eventually finds that he must return to MI6 and rediscover who he is again. The film also sees some humor come into the character as well and Craig for the most part handles it well. If Casino Royale was Craig's debut as Bond, then this is the film where he slides into the role of experienced agent.

The film's two female leads are quite interesting. Naomie Harris as Eve is an interesting, if flawed character though the character due to her lack of chemistry with Craig and being perhaps just a bit old for the whole ""junior agent"" idea to be believable. The other is B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe as S&eacute;v&eacute;rine who fits much more into the traditional role of the Bond female lead yet is also given some interesting space to develop as well. While neither is perfect, both are memorable and serve the film well.

Last but not least is Javier Bardem as the villainous Raoul Silva. From the moment the character is introduced in what seems to be a long single take, it's clear this is a villain quite different from what we've encountered before in Bond. While he does arguably have echoes of a couple of previous Bond villains as well as the Joker from The Dark Knight, Silva is more than just another madman. He's a compelling figure and a villain that, for the first time in a while, rightfully fights with Bond for your attention whenever he's on screen. There's also a feeling of discomfort that exudes from the character as well, especially in his first and last scenes. The result is perhaps the most compelling Bond villain in some time.

The film also features a strong supporting cast. Returning yet again is Judi Dench as M, getting her largest time in the role here. The film makes good use of her talents and takes the character away from being a stuck behind the desk bureaucrat and makes her a vital part of the film. There are also fine performances from Ralph Fiennes as Mallory, Ben Whishaw's excellent debut as Q, Rory Kinnear as Tanner and an excellent appearance by Albert Finney as Kincade. The result is one of the strongest casts yet put together for a Bond film.

The film also heralds some impressive action sequences. From the opening sequence in Istanbul, the film takes its viewers on a journey around the world from fights in Shanghai to a chase below and on the London streets to a final climatic battle that seems reminiscent of the finales of the classic Bond films of the 1960s yet also incredibly different from them at the same time. The sequences are all well done and are perhaps the most impressive yet seen in the Craig era.

For all of its impressive action sequences, Skyfall feels like that it is as much a drama as it is an action film. Skyfall explores questions of age and legacy, perhaps appropriately for a film series celebrating its fiftieth birthday. These range from questions about Bond's fitness to be a double-o to M's own suitability as head of MI6 to the secrets of both of their pasts which come into play as the film goes on. While the middle part of the film in London echoes The Dark Knight quite heavily (and indeed uses the nearly identical ""he wanted us to catch him"" line as well), the film works well at bringing together both the action scenes and the dramatic scenes to create a coherent story (and a great improvement over its immediate predecessor). Add on some nice references to the series' own legacy (including the much welcomed return of a character missing from the Craig era as well as icon of the series dating back to almost its beginning) and the result is fantastic all around.

So how does Skyfall stand up as both the fiftieth birthday film and as a Bond film in general? It celebrates the legacy of the series by using the plot to ask its relevance in the modern world and ultimately saying that Bond (and the series by default) does indeed. As a Bond film it pushes the boundaries of mixing action with the dramatic in a way not really seen in the series before now. On both counts then, Skyfall succeeds and does so fantastically.",1366243200,,4777,4.6129411764705885

After years of the Bond franchise looking for it's footing in the 21st century. Ms Broccoli has struck gold with Daniel Craig as James Bond. At last, a Bond that has flaws and issues!! And the character still has a lot of the baggage from the previous efforts, but Craig's take on Bond brings a whole new ""Edginess"". Sadly, we loose one of Bonds closest at the end of the film; but it is a re-launch of the institution - isn't it??
We have a brand new Q (Quartermaster). The character is now fully fleshed out and no longer the long suffering foil to James Bond. Along with this is a fresh take on the Moneypenny character; no longer just a pretty face behind a desk.

This is Daniel Craig's best 007 movie.  I never liked Daniel Craig as James bond in the first two movies (Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale) because Daniel Craig is no classic James Bond with the charisma and charm to a woman's heart.  In the first two movies (Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale), Daniel Craig was just a ruthless violent character who beat up others.

In contrast, Skyfall showed that there was more heart to James Bond which made Daniel Craig more like the classic James Bond.

Also, the opening artistic intro in the movie and the soundtrack are awesome.  It was great that the movie didn't just plop in a pop song like other movies.

Original stunts and surprises in the movie...definitely a must see.

5034200,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is a different kind of Bond, and I think he was getting some mixed reviews because viewers were comparing him to other Bonds rather than this film.

This film is continuing the origins of Bond, why he thinks the way he does - he's a tougher, more somber Bond who at the beginning of the film with an exciting chase scene through Istanbul, gets shot off a train - and survives!  (Hey, it's Hollywood, that's fine.)

I liked this film.  The action was fun but not over the top.  The scenery was very nice - the Shanghai boat scene was lavish. The moody shadow & light show as an assassin gets his rifle loaded up and takes aim.  (But why did Bond let the guy take a shot and kill his target?  That's never explained).

The Bond girls were tragic, intensely interesting and Bond's empathy for them was palpable.

Enjoyed the back & forth with Moneypenny, as she shaves him closely.  Later they discuss how it's easier to get dressed with an ""extra pair of hands.""  Cute.

Yay, we get a ""shaken not stirred"" scene at a Shanghai bar, as Bond is watched closely by a gang of toughs about to kill him.  We get a view of the Connery sports car, the Ashton Martin.

Bottom Line:

The film made fun of itself at several points, but true Bond fans would get the Easter eggs, and new viewers would be fascinated with the ""origin story"" of our favorite MI6 spy, out in the Scottish Highlands (""Skyfall"").  ""M"" is basically our co-star.  Bond is serious, has a lot of depth, and Daniel Craig plays him well.  Good film.

For the most part, I've enjoyed the over-the-top, almost cartoonish style of espionage that the series is known for, although the Daniel Craig movies seem to take a more serious stab at it. I, like many people, enjoyed the franchise reboot with Casino Royale, but was disappointed with the non-stop car chase that was Quantum of Solace. I had heard good things about Skyfall and went into this Blu-ray with high hopes.

First, the good: The Blu-ray transfer is astounding. The clarity of every shot, every scene is phenomenal. Nearly every scene is framed beautifully, and the sets are gorgeous. There are sweeping shots of cities and mountain vistas that are breathtaking, and the hyper-clarity of 1080p is truly the definition of perfect. Now, I'm not some casual movie watcher; when I watch Blu-ray, I scrutinize every detail with an eagle eye. So when I say this movie is sharp, those aren't empty words.
Another positive for Skyfall is the story. I had some issues with the moment to moment details, but there aren't any glaring plot-holes, and the story is easy to understand.
The acting is also solid, although I don't care much for Javier Bardem. There's something about the way he plays ""evil"" that I don't like. Everyone else, from 007, to M, to Q, to Moneypenny, all do a fine job. Maybe not Oscar-worthy, but good.
In the sound department, this movie also excels. It was nominated for best sound editing and sound mixing (I don't remember if it won), and with good reason. When you watch an explosive action movie like Bond, you have certain expectations. It has to sound larger-than-life while also retaining a believable, ""realistic"" feel. This, I imagine, must be a delicate balancing act, and one that is pulled off exceptionally well. The HD audio of Blu-ray does a great job of preserving the fidelity of the movie's audio.

Now, the not so good: *MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW* Bond has always been a cartoon character of sorts. His aim is perfect. He has access to gadgets that would only come in handy in very specific situations, and magically he falls into that specific situation. He always gets the girl, no matter how ridiculous. He knows how to operate any vehicle, be it helicopter, jet, hovercraft, ATV, or backhoe, and do it with finesse. This new movie (and to a lesser extent Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace) tries to bring Bond down to earth, make him more believable, more human. Unfortunately, this new Bond feels neutered. When the old Bond would have received imaginative gadgets, this new Bond is told that gadgets are old-hat. He's then given a simple Walther PPK (coded to his hand print) and radio transmitter as his only ""gadgets"", then proceeds to lose his PPK 10 minutes later without ever firing it once. Throughout the film, Bond and M are referred to as ""relics"", performing a job that was outdated decades ago, and they themselves are viewed as too old to continue doing their jobs. Frequently the movie reminds us of what Bond used to be by being self-referential, but then lets us down by reminding us that this Bond is too serious for the fun antics of old Bond. Bond is injured and his performance suffers considerably as a result, making him feel weak, but only when it's convenient to the plot. Before the credits sequence, Bond is seemingly killed, but after the credits Bond is alive and ready for duty, without any explanation as to how he came back from the dead. The main villain (who doesn't show up until halfway through the film) is captured, but then escapes minutes later off camera using a computer virus. The computer virus explains how he got out of his cell, but not how he managed to kill two armed guards with his bare hands (which is never shown or explained). The villain himself is just not that interesting, and his motivation is rather weak. And often characters make blatantly bad decisions, like when M tells Moneypenny to take the shot when Moneypenny says she doesn't have a clear shot, or when Bond lets an assassin kill his target even though he could have easily stopped him, or when Bond warns that M is in danger, but no one bothers to take her to a safe house. Some stuff just defies logic, like when Bond falls under a frozen lake in street clothes for a significant amount of time, only to pop up minutes later perfectly healthy instead of suffering from hypothermia. There is literally a scene where Bond can't fire a gun straight due to a shoulder injury, then a moment later he disarms and shoots 4 henchmen dead in as many seconds. While the overall story makes sense, the moment to moment details just baffle.

Unfortunately I did not enjoy this gadgetless, neutered Bond. The plot wasn't very strong, the villain was not very threatening, and the movie seemed to relish reminding us that old Bond movies are silly, and this one is not. I did not find the movie very engaging, and found it hard to care about any of the characters or their motivations. While some moments are a visual feast, good visuals do not a good movie make.

On a side note, I've seen some people question why the ""stolen MI6 list"" is forgotten halfway through the movie, citing this as a plot hole. My understanding is that Silva (the villain) possess the list, so when MI6 apprehends Silva, it's logical to assume they've also retrieved the list.",1365552000,3,5487,4.6887966804979255

5034260,2,B006X040NY,"""Skyfall"" is the 23rd film in Eon Production's James Bond franchise and the first action film directed by Sam Mendes, whose superb talent for drama is unable to find any foothold in this daft script. The film opens in Instanbul, Turkey, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) has been dispatched to retrieve an errant harddrive containing the identities of all undercover NATO agents embedded in terrorist cells. He fails to do so after a lengthy action sequence in which he pursues a mercenary by the name of Patrice (Ola Rapace). Bond is forced to retire from the Service by a near death experience at the hands of a novice field agent (Naomi Harris) and takes to drinking and popping pills in exotic locales...until the villain behind the harddrive theft blows up MI6's London headquarters and gets free reign of its computer system. A broken Bond springs back into action.

Where did this harddrive with the identities of undercover agents come from? Why would such a thing be circulating? And how could anyone decrypt it? Who knows? M (Judi Dench), head of the British Secret Service, is asked to resign over this blunder, but she refuses to leave. And she refuses to recall the agents who have been compromised. Now, at this point, one would expect her to be removed from MI6 at gunpoint and perhaps escorted to the nearest lockup. But M must remain, regardless of gross incompetence and questionable mental health, because the villain, a former MI6 agent calling himself Silva (Javier Bardem), was driven mad by torture and plans to carry out a personal vendetta against M, whom he holds responsible for his own twisted fate. He will do this by hacking MI6's secure computer system, which is apparently not a mainframe.

At this point, in walks James Bond, an old, alcoholic, drug-addled, and very neurotic misanthrope in a state of perpetual misery. But Bond has a sentimental attachment to M, who sends him into the field, even though he is mentally unstable, failed every physical and psychiatric test that MI6 could devise, and appears to be suffering from the DTs. ""Skyfall""'s writers seem to have taken a page from ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Our superhero is all of a sudden a mental and physical basketcase, but he will inexplicably regain his prowess -and his cartilage- when the time comes to fight the bad guy. Silva looks like Julian Assange doing The Joker, so that wasn't the only Batman movie the writers saw. He's a silver-haired computer hacker and insane agent of chaos who wreaks havoc by posting sensitive information on YouTube. This is supposed to embody contemporary fears?

The plot is so ridiculous that it's unwatchable. Explaining how bad it is won't spoil anything. There's nothing to spoil. The conclusions are forgone. The audience will only be surprised at how clumsily the plot points are resolved, when they are resolved at all. It's as if the writers went out of their way to make every scene unbelievable. ""Skyfall""'s themes are even less coherent. There is a confused message about transparency. MI6 fears Silva's forced transparency, but there is a lot of rhetoric about whether the agency can or cannot continue to work ""in the shadows."" MI6 needs transparency, or it doesn't. M fears that the new enemies of the civilized world cannot be identified, but she knew Silva well. He's not mysterious. He's a loon with an axe to grind. It's not clear what the enemy is here, speaking figuratively. Is the enemy transparency, chaos, or the mentally ill?

Nostalgia is another major theme, though it's similarly unclear what is being said about it. There is nostalgia for Bond's childhood, for his old Astin Martin, for homemade explosives, for antique shotguns, for gamekeepers, for straight razors, for loyalty, for clarity, for ""the old ways."" M is accused of nostalgia for the Cold War. But MI6 concedes that it cannot fight Silva, who is just one mischievous hacker, on his own ground. The old spy agency can't compete in the high-tech world. It must lure Silva -by means of the most sophisticated technology- into tangibly primitive territory -Scotland- in order to conquer him. Are they kidding? Silva is a joke. No one would be afraid of his antics. But I do get the impression that the writers and producers of ""Skyfall"" fear modern technology. They clearly don't understand a thing about it. They want you to think it's spooky.

""Skyfall"" did make me nostalgic...for James Bond. What can be said for an action film that has an unappealing protagonist, no sympathetic or compelling characters, lasts 2 hours and 20 minutes, and whose action sequences are so dull that I didn't notice that they were action sequences after the first one? Where is the entertainment value in this film? James Bond was an iconic action hero, because men all wanted to be him and women all wanted to sleep with him. He was a brash, principled, bon vivant. He enjoyed life. And he wanted to accomplish something. Daniel Craig's Bond hates everyone and everything. He vacillates between being sociopathic and cloyingly sentimental. He promises a woman protection, then waits until she is dead to do something about it. He's driven primarily by self-loathing. Why would I want to watch this?",1365292800,30,5204,4.909090909090909
5034261,2,B006X040NY,"Slow, predictable and uninteresting storyline.  Opening sequence is fast paced with jaw dropping action (as expected) then the dullness takes it from there (not expected).

5034285,1,B006X040NY,"This review is not specifically for the DVD, but for the movie itself.

As with all of the Bond films, I find the lead character interesting. Not likeable, but interesting. This show, as with the others, was interesting and engaging. It seemed quite a lot more creepy than the last one, though, and I did not like it as much. I would give it three stars for entertainment quality.

The reason I am writing this review, however, and the reason I am giving the entire movie just one star, is that I have one TREMENDOUS issue with something not just amoral but actually a horrible human rights atrocity which is portrayed in the middle of the film.

Bond is typically a womanizer; no news there. But typically it seems that his sexual encounters are with women who also choose the encounter.

Not so in one (of the three) such encounters in this film.

While trying to track down the bad guy of this particular film, Bond meets a woman (Severine) who he senses is gripped by great fear. He catches her wrist, notes that she is marked as a prostitution slave, and declares that he can help her, that he will track down the bad guy of the film and set her free. I should note that it is not absolutely clear whether the man (the bad guy of whom she is in mortal fear) is still using her for sex after removing her from outright forced prostitution, but it certainly seems that way. Severine gives Bond the information regarding where he can find her (if he succeeds in knocking off a few guys first, which of course he does) so that he can go with her to the lair of the bad guy.

There is no indication in this scene that Bond and the woman are romantically interested in one another.

The next scene in which they meet again shows the woman taking a shower on her boat, unaware that Bond has made it to the boat as well. He slips in naked to the shower behind her, and of course the scene closes soon afterward with the assumption that things progress sexually between them from there.

I am phenomenally disturbed by this incredible perversion of justice! This woman was a SLAVE. Literally held captive and used for sex. Bond tells her that he can rescue her. And then what does he do? He uses her for sex.

Let me say it again. This woman was held captive as a sex slave. Against her will. And what does James Bond do? He uses her for sex. This is not even a voluntary one-night-stand kind of situation, as detestable and sad as such a situation might be. This is Bond assuming that he can have sex with a woman who is at that very time being held hostage (presumably still as a sex slave) against her will. As such, she has no way to escape from Bond. How despicable and ghastly would it be for a man to treat a woman as inhumanely as is here shown?

I am deeply disturbed by this atrocious, horrendous, despicable scene.

There are literally millions of women across the globe who are currently held captive against their will for such evil purposes as these. It is absolutely heartbreaking. To see this perverse evil endorsed in such a way by the lead character of such a popular movie is beyond disgusting. It is heinous.",1365206400,3,3124,4.3782383419689115

Javier Bardem really brings a certain creepiness and ruthless personality to the Bond Villain as Silva. Silva is different from Le Chiffre (Casino Royale) and Greene (Quantum of Solace). He's much more intelligent, more ruthless, and he is actually a great threat to Bond and MI6.

When it was explained what Skyfall was I was stunned.  I really hated to see what happened to his boss.  My husband and daughter agreed with him that it would have been neat to have her be James's long lost Grandmother or something like that.  But it didn't happen that way and she wasn't.

Gone entirely is the sophistication and humor that added to the enjoyable aura of pre-Craig Bond pictures.  That said, this should effectively revise the franchise, which with (especially) Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan had grown a little too jokey and science-fiction-oriented for my taste.  On the other hand, the cynical, amoral spy who has seen too much has become a very familiar figure.  Curiously we are introduced to Moneypenny at the very end of the film as Bond meets the new M--Ralph Fiennes, of all people.  The one thing that irritates me about this genre, as with almost all action movies, are the ways in which, with minimum or no damage, the hero survives falls, fights and bullet wounds that in the real world would be either fatal or totally debilitatiing.

Doesn't come across as much of a Bond flick, but a good (if unbelievable) spy thriller.

I go to Bond for the gadgets, for the car, for the women (yes, I am that shallow)

Gadgets in this flick is a gun that is provided without even an extra clip of ammunition.

Q, boring, hackerish activities on computers.... Uh yeah, now let's assume that the villain is really trying to draw Bond in, so yeah, maybe he planted a readable string into an encrypted text.

M, well, Dame Dench, never a big fan of her, or the portrayal they have of her in the movies.  I'm sure she's a nice woman in real life, but when Bond is pushed to shove, even he defines her as a ""B****"".

Just not a lot of likability on the part of the characters.

Still I managed to put on ""Bond Blinders"" treat it as a spy flick and from that perspective though the actions of the characters at major plot points were questionable it was entertaining.

There's also a special guest star towards the end of the movie, they gave it quite the nice send off.

However, when I was streaming this video from Amazon, randomly I would lose connection to there server. The connection would drop and resolution would drop as well.  Personal I understand that the internet has many crazy reason for failing.  So, the reason I'm telling you all this is because a day later I received an Email from Amazon apologizing for the bad connection.  They then refunded my Credit Card for the 4.99 I spent on renting this movie.  For this, I will Shop at Amazon and Rent movies from them.  They care that you have a great experience with online streaming.

the beginning of this movie presents you with symbols of  mythology of "" Once and Future King"" The poem by Tennyson is powerful. As the symbols of old bond such as the car Bond pulls out of storage which made me smile........very much.
Clearly Bond has to carry the day, not new fangled technology....as shown how he gets the bad guy in the end.

The struggles Craig goes through as Bond really speak to who he is as a character but it is not for those not intimately acquainted with the bond universe.

I think daniel Craig could be a great Bond, if given the opportunity. Like Casino Royale, but here, There's the leaked agent list angle that gets forgotten halfway through the movie, to the villian who quite frankly isn't that scary. I don't care how brilliant you are, you can't concieve of every contengent of a plan. Why get caught when you can kill M in the courtroom, What makes  A Bond villian scary is they're not out to get M or Bond or MI6. They're out to take over the world, or a portion of it. And last but not least is Bond himself, it appears that Bond can lose his swagger just by being shot off a train. Bond has always been compared to the stranger, you don't want to know what his past his. He comes into to town, takes care of business, and leaves. Women want to be with him, men want to be him. Because doesn't lose his swagger, always in control. No one wants to know who he was before he joined MI6, that's the legend of James Bond. Sadly he is dead, and has been replaced by a mere shell of himself. We need the other James Bond back, also. The gunbarrel always, always opens to the movie, not end it.

Have you ever (during a really intense scene) said to yourself, I wish it would slow down just a bit? Well, I thing this 007 movie does just that, slow down just a bit. But as every Bond movie has done before this one, been better than the one preceding, this 007 is no different. They keep getting better and better.

If it were James Burns instead of James Bond, I might have appreciated it more, but as far as Bond goes, this one certainly went--astray. From my conversations with people who loved it, many had never seen the earliest films, and none had read any of the books. Seeing this flick, you would think that the writers had never read one either, as they were too busy leafing through Marvel comics.

5034369,5,B006X040NY,"Skyfall came without much fanfare but has become essential viewing for  many Bond film lovers. We have the familiarity of a Bond film but Sam Mendes infuses it with enough fun to make it a stand alone thriller.

We have Bond in a rut struggling with middle age and substance abuse. However he is rejuvenated through the film and luckily for us he rises up to the challenge.

Then we have the mandatory  villain and this it is Silva ( Javier Bardem) who does not make an appearance until halfway through the film. In Skyfall it is Silva, a cyber terrorist who has stolen a list of undercover agents and is planning on blowing their cover. To retrieve this chip we have Bond enduring a brilliantly shot chase scene on the streets of Istanbul.

A Bond film would be no fun without the exotic locations and this one does not disappoint, I thought this was one of the most visually rich of any Bond film in recent times, from the gambling den in Macau, to the glass tower with its floating Jelly fish, the island in South China to the countryside in Scotland, this is a beautiful film to look at.

Javier Bardem as Silva is amazing and another reason to watch the film. He appears very late in the film but once he appears it is difficult to keep your eyes off him even in the presence of beautiful Bond girls such as Svrine (Brnice Marlohe) and Miss MoneyPenny ( Naomie Harris). However in Skyfall, Bond does not have much time for women except M who is played by Judi Dench. Together Bond and Miss M have a lot of issues to resolve ......with her cold looks she tells Bond that "" Orphans make the best agents""
This is a good film and a great Bond film in a long time,to paraphrase Adele, ""Hold your breath and count to ten, this is not the end"". .........five stars. 3/23/13",1364774400,,1771,4.367781155015198

5034377,3,B006X040NY,"Some thoughts on the new James bond movie, the third Daniel Craig installment, SKYFALL.
The first  Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale, was a complete success. Bond looked gritty and sexy, damaged and moody.  The villain, LeShiffe, was a modern take on the iconic Sean Connery-era Bond villain; the story line was believable, ( the villain, LeShiffe, needing money, arranging a high stakes card game in Monaco, Bond infiltrating with a beautiful assistant who of course he falls in love with blah blah blah )  all of the elements were there to make a fantastic moving exciting world class travelogue movie. The director and writer took chances with Bond falling in love and his woman dying and got the audience's full participation and involvement.
The second Daniel Craig movie QUANTUM OF SOLACE was not as good but because it started where the first movie ended it already had a narrative flow; basically of revenge against the man behind the death of the woman Bond had loved. The villain was not as interesting and was kind of slimy and the locale although world class was not as rich as the first movie and the finale of the second movie Quantum of Solace was not nearly as satisfying and was basically a big shoot 'em up explosive ending. A SouthAmerican dictator and his thugs against Bond and the girl who was not an agent. Quantum Of Solace did have some fabulous supporting locales and characters which made it almost as good as the first movie. Besides the beautiful girl agent who is killed ""a la Goldfinger "" only this time coated with oil the beginning of the movie has some very disconcerting plot lines like M's personal bodyguard had been a double agent for years and no one knew it so you get the impression that MI 6 is not impenetrable but is vulnerable this adds to the general feeling of bond as a free agent able to work outside the system blah blah blah
The third Daniel Craig installment SKYFALL upset and surprised me.
The title SKYFALL made me think it was going to be about some sort of  "" Terminator3-type "" thing that combined North Korea era nuclear missiles with China/ some kind of interplanetary  world class Sean Connery era bond plot . But the exact opposite is true. The movie begins well enough with an incredible chase scene which feels a little bit manipulative but satisfying because that's what we've come to expect.
We meet a beautiful agent assisting 007. She accidentally kills him, being ordered by M to take a shot at Bond fighting another man atop a moving train. The next part of the movie is a bit confusing, the title credits involve Bond seemingly dying and are fabulous but after that we are given the impression that he has officially died or been retired because he's a little older and scruffy unshaven and grey and damaged. The next part of the movie is not quite up to par there is someone who has hacked into MI 6 and killed 1/2 dozen people in the main office but while M was not there so we get the impression that someone trying to personally torment her for something she did in the past. Bond follows an unlikely lead to a strange casino somewhere to make a connection with a beautiful woman who is somehow damaged raised as a sex slave owned by someone and in complete terror for her life. Up to this point the movie feels really gritty and interesting. Bond is obviously older damaged bothered by the bullet wound in the shoulder he has a friendly flirting relationship with the beautiful agent who shot him meets the second beautiful woman in the movie who is very damaged. Bond probably has sex with her and then ends up on this island owned by the villain who we finally meet. The villain introduces himself in what is obviously a well thought out provocatively staged entrance where he walks slowly across the room telling a story which we realize we have to listen to because it's the focal point of the movie it explains who he is why he's damaged why he wants to kill M and get revenge on her and kind of explains the relation between him and M. him and Bond and Bond and M and him and M and Bond and if you don't catch all this while he's walking across the room towards Bond you're sort of lost . The next part is very disconcerting and not satisfying and started to turn me off to the flow of the movie . The villain executes that second beautiful woman and that's the only two beautiful women in the movie which I think is the major flaw.  The beautiful agent who accidentally shoots Bond and and then appears time and again throughout the film, and the second beautiful woman that he had sex with once and who is then killed in front of Bond by the villain. So we are left with only one beautiful woman in the movie who is not having sex with Bond and not really interacting with him just friendly flirtation and Bond is completely on his own older grittier damaged moody and we feel somewhat the same way. We feel older grittier damaged and moody while watching the film; at least I did.
So we move on to some good parts which are; the oddly simplistic capture of the villain by the MI 6 people with helicopters. He is put in a ""Hannibal-Lector-type"" cell where he doesn't seem worried he explains that  he wants revenge on M for M's betrayal of him and trading him for some other agents years ago when he had overextended itself , so he basically admits that he was bad that he was punished by M and that's why he doesn't like her and wants revenge on her. The second part of his wanting revenge has to do with him trying to commit suicide by breaking the cyanide capsule in his tooth as agents are instructed to do and instead of the cyanide capsule his tooth contained another drug which damages the inside of his head or throat or sinus, causing him to have an implant kind of like a artificial bridge top part of his jaw which he pulls out and shows us how physically damaged he is and this is supposed to make us horrified and feel really sorry for him but of course you can't fool sorry for him because he's an unrepentant vicious villain anyway.
The next part of the movie goes into the realm of Mission Impossible because when the young Q hacks into the computer of the villain we are shown some kind of ingenius living algorithm. While the youthful Q is trying to break the code , Bond of course spots something on the screen and helps to break the code which then allows the villain's computer again to hack into the MI 6 computer before Q can stop it and opens all of the some kind of subterranean doorways to underground London.  Bond of course realizes that this is how the villain was planning to escape and he rushes to the cell our villain was in and then follows our villain on a chase on and off packed subway cars through the underground until the villain (  when Bond has a chance to actually stop him decides to wait for a few seconds while the villain )  activates a bomb which blows open the roof of the subterranean passage allowing the subway train to fly in and a fabulous violent scene allowing the villain to escape. All of this money and all of this planning was spent just so he could walk in and shoot M in front of a prime minister and a bunch of investigators in a closed session. Of course Bond and the girl agent and Ralph Feinnes as the assistant PM have a big shootout in the room and stop them which is rather anticlimactic. The villain escapes again and Bond decides to do something really off the wall and kidnaps M leaving a trail for the villain to find her so the villain can finally kill M.
At this point in the film they decided to commemorate 50 years of James bond by Daniel Craig bringing M to a lockup which is what the British call parking garages or car garages he brings M to a lock up where the original James bond Aston Martin is kept in pristine condition and he drives away ,  instructing Q to leave a trail so that the villain can find them.
At his point in the film I turned to my wife and said , ""So when and where is the title name SKYFALL going to enter the movie and as I said the words Bond drives to a remote area of Scotland with M , turns into a driveway were an Irish deer sculpture is on the pedestal at the entrance to the driveway which has a sign on it saying SKYFALL. We then realize that Bond has brought M to his childhood home we find out the names of his parents when he left that he was an orphan we meet the crotchety old Scottish caretaker who just happens to be hanging around with a shotgun and we are entertained to the anti climactic ending of an older Bond and older M and an older caretaker setting booby traps and preparing to be invaded by this villain whose only intention is to kill M. After a rather boring and uninteresting shootout chase across and moors the action ends with M's death in the chapel. The movie ends with the beautiful assistant agent giving bond his inheritance from M's will, which is an ugly British bulldog statue she used to keep on her desk that he always hated . Then, we are once again reminded of the 50th anniversary because we find out that the beautiful agent assistant who's been assigned desk duty her last name is Moneypenny , her office looks like the original Sean Connery James bond reception office where he comes in ( and if you remember throws his hat on the hat rack )  so Daniel Craig walks in meets Moneypenny, then enters the assistant prime minister's office and receives his next assignment.
The movie needed a better finale. Perhaps a better reason for the villain to want to kill M or a better way of killing her or getting his revenge on her.
The movie needed at least one or two less damaged beautiful females.
What would have saved the movie is if Bond had somehow repaired himself a little bit more physically so that he looked a little better and was more fit because he decided he needed to be a little more fit to deal with this if they had introduced another female who was not damaged but perhaps was as interesting as Bond almost like a partner and then if they had set the finale in something or someplace a little more exciting flashy or interesting and not done a shoot-em-up with explosions but instead have done some more intellectual intriguing type of competition or contest this movie would be as good as Casino Royale as it is it's not as good as Quantum of Solace so they started out with a perfect movie the second one was less perfect and the third one is even less interesting.

To this Bond fan who was reading the books before the first Broccolization of 007,  the Daniel Craig pics are far truer to my personal idea of James Bond than any of their semi-comic predecessors.  My one bit of evidence of more serious intent was the appearance of the china bulldog on M's desk-- I had just seen it on Control's desk in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  Both  John le Carr  and  Ian Fleming are said to have had some real-life experience with MI6, and in terms of ""truthiness"" I'd rank them Carr  Fleming, and  the movies.  Sure there's a nod to the goofiness of the quartermaster and the some of the traditional Bond shtick, but overall I found the characters to be much more believable.

Hence, this is a putdown of Her Majesty's precious Secret Service! Maybe the climb up Brokeback got the movie crew off track?

On the plus side: Marvelous Adele! Perfect song! Best James Bond singer ever!

And, nifty action sections, with just a few surprises. My favorite Miss Moneypenny of all times and the new Q was a brilliant step up.

While I actually enjoyed QOS despite the horrid opinions of some, I found myself watching the wall half way through this bore fest. I actually managed to slog through the entire film, but much like the worst Bond films, there is very little substance to this film. But unlike the other ""worst"" films, there is no flash to at least sit back and enjoy the nonsense... there is only pretentious bull to bore you to sleep and make you wonder if the next two Bond films will even be worth the price of entry. The villain fell flat on every level... the story was absolute rubbish after about 30 minutes, and Bond became an unlikable ""hero"" at about the same pace. At least with previous Craig films, and Dalton portrayals, there was a humanisation of Bond that drew you towards the character. In this film.. that is destroyed with his absolute machine like thinking during so much of the film... the other half is of course the required ""boo hoo I""m scarred"" pretentious crap that is infecting so much of entertainment right now that this Bond and this film just fails on so many levels.

I enjoy grittier tales... I enjoyed ""scarred"" heroes... but unlike Dalton and his two films, Skyfall just utterly fails on that front and, in the end, fails to deliver a good Bond movie period. How this movie has such overwhelming good reviews beyond me... it is a testament to ""gritty, dark, edgy"" absolutely drowning franchise and making it not only insufferable, but frustratingly boring. I recognise I am probably the minority here... but avoid this film if you are a true Bond fan.

I didn't really know what to expect, but I was not disappointed this time.  The story was phenomenal.  The acting brought you into the story and never let go.  The filming locations from running and racing through the streets and roof tops of Istanbul, Turkey to the final battle in the Scottish Highlands where spectacularly shot and played well with the story itself.
Daniel Craig once again played Bond outstandingly well.  The Dame Judi Dench as M was, as always,  classy, refined and beautiful. Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Gareth Mallory, the uptight bureaucrat, until you put his back up against a wall and he turns into a real badass.  And lastly what can I say about Javier Bardem's performance as the captured, forgotten, broken and turned evil Silva. He was unforgettable and will go down in infamy with the great Bond villains.

And that is it, really. No disrespect to my father's James Bond played by Sean Connery - who WAS my favorite Bond before _Skyfall_ - but Craig just FEELS like the killer that one needs to be in the role of 00 agent on Her Majesty's Secret Service. Craig is just incredibly believable in this role.

I'm not going to describe a plot you can devour in ten thousand other places. The wonder of this movie is that it is a transitional film bringing in new players for old roles and modernizing Bond for today's world. Despite that, it has action sequences that stand shoulder to shoulder with the best the fifty year old franchise has to offer.

The strength of this movie is Dame Judith Dench in the role of 'M'. There has never been a M/007 relationship in the history of the BOND franchise even close to being as intriguing as this one and Craig and Dench drain that relationship for every last drop of charisma in this film. There are a lot of good Bond movies out there. I consider this a great Bond _FILM_.",1364428800,,1321,4.254980079681275

5034470,5,B006X040NY,"The Daniel Craig movies have really injected new life into the James Bond franchise, but ""Skyfall"" is possibly one of the best Bond movies EVER.

This movie is not just a brilliant Bond movie, or a brilliant spy thriller, but a brilliant movie in general -- beautifully filmed, combining the old-school James Bond formula with a very 21st-century brand of terrorism. But what truly elevates this beautiful movie is Sam Mendes' focus on both Bond and M, and the terrible costs of living their lives.

A hard drive containing information on double agents is stolen in Istanbul, and Bond (Daniel Craig) nearly manages to get it back. But he's accidentally shot by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. He's not dead, obviously -- but he uses this as a chance to retire to a tropical island.

But then MI6 is hacked by a cyberterrorist, and their headquarters is blown up. Bond reappears in London to offer his services to his country again, but he's obviously not fit for duty -- physically or psychologically. Despite this, M (Judi Dench) sends him back out to find the cyberterrorists before more agents are killed.

The trail leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent who specializes in cyberterrorism. He blames M for his torture and mutilation, and is determined to destroy her career before killing her. Even capturing Silva isn't enough to stop him, and soon Bond must flee London with M to make a final stand against Silva.

If there is a underlying question to ""Skyfall,"" it is this: Does an old-fashioned agent like James Bond belong in a world of cyberterrorism and individual extremism? Well, yes. The nature of conflict, evil and cruelty will never change, only the media through which they are spread. It's expressed in a lovely speech by M, which seems to say, ""So what if it's the age of Bourne and Fast & Furious? Bond is timeless.""

But Sam Mendes does sow some seeds of doubt about the ""old guard"" -- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.

Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.

The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.

Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.

But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.

""Skyfall"" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character. The next Bond movie will have a tough act to follow.",1364342400,,3671,4.765354330708662

Being one of the few persons who does not miss the goofy antics that had been put into some of the previous films, I was very delighted when Craige made his character a mans-man. (yes I know that the screen writer and directors, etc. have alot in the character development.)

All the new characters introduced during 23, as well as all the old favorites, created a dynamic cast who lived up to the Bond reputation.

And while I am not a crier, I balled my eyeballs out like a baby during this movie.  The love and devotion that is created thru and during Craig's three films made for a breath taking ride that makes my heart stop every time I watch them.

5034475,4,B006X040NY,"Confession: I have only seen the Daniel Craig James Bond movies.  I like them, and I keep intending to watch the other Bonds, I just never have.  I feel guilty for missing out on the history when I watch them.

Skyfall definitely has old-fashioned pacing.  After the dynamic train sequence at the beginning of the film, it's a slow burn to the explosive finale.  Oh, there are some little action sequences here and there, but director Sam Mendes keeps it simple until its time to break lose and let Bond, Silva (Javier Bardem), and M (Judi Dench) have it out.

I am enamored of the lighting and color in Skyfall.  There are several terrific uses of silhouette, but none better than when Bond grapples with a hitman in a skyscraper with an open window.  It's blue and beautiful and has lingered in my mind.  So many action films are utterly forgettable and interchangeable, so I'd love Skyfall for that sequence alone.

But Skyfall isn't overly arty.  It delivers everything a Bond film promises, what everyone expects whether they've seen a Bond movie before or not.  Chases, a cool car, beautiful women, inventive attempts at murder.  It's frequently funny, even the ruthless M providing plenty of humor.  There is some musing over whether the ends justify the means, but the heroes of the movie are still unquestionably the heroes.

Some elements of the story are weak.  One part of Silva's plan relies on Q, the genius of M1-6, to do something rather dumb.  Of course he does it.  But the characters aren't repeatedly stupid, so I can forgive a few missteps made for the sake of pushing the plot forward.

I really should watch the other Bond films, given how much I've enjoyed Craig's outings as the famous spy.  And I'll definitely keep watching his tenure, and probably that of his successor.",1364256000,,1798,4.720257234726688

From the origins of 007 in Casino Royale to the amazing ending of Skyfall which brilliantly tied the new to the old stories, James Bond is back and Daniel Craig is the best of the bunch. My immediate reaction after seeing Skyfall was that now the stage is set for the remake of all of the original stories, with updated technology, and of course, Bond will need a new Aston Martin now.",1364256000,,691,4.448818897637795

5034483,3,B006X040NY,"Just when I'm finally getting used to Daniel Craig in the role of James Bond - and Skyfall is indeed his best performance in the role - the Bond franchise owners seem to be building a case that he is getting for the role.  But in Skyfall they are simultaneously building two other age-related discrimination cases:  the case that secret agent 007 James Bond himself may be too old to do his job effectively; and the case that the Bond franchise itself is a dated relic of the Cold War past.  There certainly is a case to be made in each of these areas, but the question is why would the Bond filmmakers make it and thereby undermine their own money-printing machine?  By doing so they deserve kudos for facing up to reality (and they avoid mockery), but one wonders where the Bond franchise will go after Skyfall, even though it doesn't appear to be the end of the road for James Bond.

The primary reason I don't rank Skyfall among the all-time best Bond films is that it falls short in the formulaic aspects.  Bond films always contain death defying action sequences with multi-vehicle chases, a demented evil villain, beautiful women (the Bond girls), and gizmos.  All these are present in Skyfall, but none of them is quite as memorable as the best of Bond from the past.  Several times, as when Bond resurrects one of his blasts from the past, it seems that director Sam Mendes is gratuitously following the formula with a wink and a nod to the audience.  The action sequence finale of Skyfall also does not measure up to the best of Bond purely due to the plot, which left James Bond defending himself and a couple of very old folks from the onslaught of a madman's private army.  Bond comports himself admirably, of course, but the old folks can't and don't add much to the action at the end.  The net effect is that, at the end of the film, the Bond formula appears old and tired, and this viewer was left wondering how it is going to be revitalized in the future.  Is it time already to retire Daniel Craig, magically rewind the clock on the age of James Bond, and start anew?

Even if that is the plan, the Bond franchise faces challenges, the chief one being creating villains that worldwide audiences root against.  Skyfall makes the argument that the villains of the future are not countries but individuals, which may indeed be true, but Skyfall also plays it safe by not having its evil villain come from an ""Axis of Evil"" region of the world.  This might work for one movie, but where will the next Bond villain come from?  Another challenge is the waning influence of the British empire and hence its secret service, which is even directly addressed in Skyfall.  The world, and the U.K.'s position in it, look a lot different now than at the end of World War II.  Where will this lead the Bond franchise in the future?  It may be worth watching the next Bond film just to find out, but it certainly appears that they heyday of James Bond is past.",1364256000,,2963,4.484171322160149

5034500,1,B006X040NY,"Probably the worst James Bond movie I ever seen, one hour too long too many scenes should have been cut. M and James makes so many mistakes, the enemy is just stupid but bold and does not kill James Bond when he can so many times just kill him. The plot is very poorly made, movie too long, boring at times action scenes are the only part that is good about the movie but it is very weak.

This movie is not James Bond nothing about it makes a James Bond movie. It lacks girls, fast fancy cars (got some old fancy cars but bond always rides the best cars) no fancy weapons it just goes wrong in so many places the plot does not feel like James Bond movie. Oh and the bad guys is just a poor agent that is getting back against M and you know what it feel like she deserves it the way she treats the agents you might even feel Bond dislikes it as well.

In fact (spoiler do not read UNTIL you watch movie) But I think he wanted M to die as well he seems not to care about her that much pretends to protect her. You protect the head of M16 by taking her out to nowhere and defending against an army of bad guys!!! Also we never found out who shoot Bond in the start we think its the Girl he work with but the bullets do not match. Oh and after M dies no funeral for her and Bond still gets to keep his job after he kidnapped his boss to so called protect her.

Do not rent or pay for this movie if you can watch it for free on Netflix then do it otherwise do not support lame movies like this, hopefully more people will post one star reviews on this movie and they will never again create something like this and next Bond will be a real Bond movie. Please edit a movie and test it out before sending out a movie that is way longer then it should, cut the extra scenes no one cares about them and lastly we need some real bad guys to match Bond against. If anything the film makers need to watch ALL the old Bond movies before creating junk like this. If this was not called James Bond it actually would not be recognized as a James Bond movie this movie is just this bad.",1364169600,8,2070,3.9711538461538463

5034503,2,B006X040NY,"Certainly not the worst Bond movie ever, but certainly not the best. After teasing us by building an intense chase scene followed by one of the best Bond songs in a very long time, the movie descends into averageness with its garden variety revenge plot. As an action movie, Skyfall fails; after the first action sequence, action scenes are few and far in between, not to mention short and unimaginative. For example, the fact that Bond's gun is palm-print activated barely comes into play. Even the climactic battle is snoozer; what, Bond is going to make a Jason Bourne-like final stand in the castle he grew up in? We're not even given enough time to process this information for it to carry the necessary emotional impact. So, I really don't know who is writing the reviews that say this movie is action packed. But Skyfall also fails as a Bond movie. We have to face the fact that the gadgets are never coming back for this Bond, that this Bond's sexual prowess will henceforth be visually neutered for the sake of a PG-13 rating, and that Craig is starting to look too old for this assignment. On a positive note or two, Javier Bardem did a decent job being a just-under an over-the-top villain (sadly, he doesn't show up until half-way through the movie). The new Q is promising as well. Other than that, I cannot recommend this movie. You're better off spying something else, which would be more spying than takes place in this flick.",1364169600,3,1442,4.63671875

5034514,5,B006X040NY,"'Skyfall' is being heralded in some quarters as the best 007 film ever.

Pretty bold talk, and not altogether false. It's going to be hard for any new effort in the series to capture the essence of James Bond after such iconic examples as 'Goldfinger' (1964) or 'Thunderball' (1965).  Even Roger Moore's brilliant re-imagining of the character in 'Live and Let Die' stands alone. That said, the 23rd film in the most esteemed series in film history (7 out of 10 people in THE WORLD have seen a Bond film) by director Sam Mendes and starring Daniel Craig is superlative example.

The plot- Bond is thought killed in action and a rogue agent declares war on MI-6 and particularly on it's boss 'M' (Dame Judi Dench) is brought down to it's core emotional levels of honor, revenge, courage and perserverance. It connects on ALL of those levels. Director Mendes ('American Beauty') and a stellar cast including Javier Badim as a notable, nuanced bad guy
offer a film that is exciting and thoughtful throughout, and Director of Photography Roger Deakins ('Fargo', and other Coen bros. films) shot the living bejeebus out of it and garnered his TENTH Oscar nomination. At 2 hours and 20 minutes or so there isn't an ouce of flab anywhere to be seen.

Thomas Newman wrote an Oscar nominated score for it and Adele won a much deserved Academy Award for the title song.

The film gets better on repeated viewings. Not always the case with recent Bond outings. But it is SO rich that you will continuously find something cool you missed. Has the best ending of any film since the good old days; establishing Ralph Fiennes as the new- oops plot giveaway- not going to go there.

Great stuff. Hope the next outing is as good as this was...",1364169600,,1726,4.661184210526316

5034518,3,B006X040NY,It didn't live up to the hype. Daniel Craig makes a good Bond though. Average Bond film-not as good as Casino Royale-with Craig. Connery and Moore are dated so their efforts are relegated to dustbin of history. Make an R-rated film for once-you know like Arnold or Stallone. Brits are too tame for U.S. audience. My advice to  Brits is to stay with Dr. Who or some other babbling-that's their specialty.,1364169600,,403,4.676056338028169

Unfortunately... as a huge Bond fan I ran into that feeling at least a couple of times.

What was wrong?  You will see... two moments when Bond proves to be not that clever after all... and leaves you wondering why someone in MI6 would ever not take advantage of an easy target.  It almost reminded me of that movie Gold Member when the Dr Evils son is telling his dad, ""why not just let me shoot him..."" and ""Dr Evil"" then goes into a diatribe on why he can't (secret agent movie protocols).

As for Javier Bardem's performance seemed to me to not fit in the movie, as his concept of a Bond bad guy was too well acted, too sincere. Of course, Javier is not capable of doing less. The movie made a billion dollars. Great. I love to see a movie succeed. We need to move onto to another incarnation of Bond. Daniel Craig is also a fine actor and needs to move onto other things.
I am not being a sour apple here for the sake of being a sour apple. I didn't like the movie, starting with that awful, in my opinion, opening song Skyfall. Talk about insipid lyrics. Where is Shirley Bassey and Goldfinger. Now that was a song sung by a great singer.
The only reason I give 3 stars is that there have been worse Bond movies.

I've studied the films, the literature and the history.  I believe I know this genre as few do.  I never thought that Sean Connery could be displaced as the definitive James Bond but Daniel Craig is the best Bond yet. Not only is his characterization masterful, his portrayal is enhanced by the technical skill employed in the Bond movies he's made.  Skyfall is the best yet.  There are several reasons why.  From a technical viewpoint the film is a masterpiece (with the slight imperfection of the wound in his shoulder mysteriously moving from one side to the other during the film), the supporting cast has evolved into significant characters in their own right (which serves to enhance Craig's characterization), and the depth of plot and personification moves the film to a higher level than any previously achieved.  For the first time, you begin to feel for James Bond as a person, as a real man who is both flawed and touchingly human.  I highly recommend this film for those who appreciate work of this type.",1364083200,,1160,4.8232323232323235

5034577,3,B006X040NY,"I think that the movie was a bit long and this may be because there are scenes that I have seen before in other 'chase ' movies.
Eg The rooftop chase very much as in Batman and I wonder how tiles can support a moving vehicle.
The chase in the cars through city streets and stalls, smashing through stock barrows has been filmed many times.
Bond gets shot twice yet when we see him again there are very mild bullet entry wounds on his body.
That's not realistic.
Shooting the woman with the whisky cup on her head was just unnecessary senseless killing for shock value and was violence for violence sake.
A cheap shot..!!
The photographic imagery in Shanghai might have been clever but I found it confusing.with all the coloured neons.
The biggest hole in the picture was in the final chapter where Q sets up a trail for the bad guys
to trace Bond and M.
Surely he had the brains to send the cavalry at the same time but no, Bond had to handle the mess himself with the help of an old gamekeeper.
Most persons I heard from liked the movie so maybe I was expecting more and more of a return to believability but no, I think it is returning to the old style of guns , girls and gadgets.
Give me back the two previous Bond movies thanks.
They were more realistic.

5034582,5,B006X040NY,"A true thrill ride from beginning to end. This one is perhaps the best Bond of the last half century of Bond films. Daniel Craig portrays James Bond as he lives through the demise of MI6 to become the last surviving double-O. He brings down a loose cannon agent who turned against his country (recycled plot from GoldenEye) and sought revenge against ""M"" and the entire MI6 agency.

Dame Judy Dentch makes her last appearance as Bond's boss, and like Pierce Brosnan did in ""The World Is Not Enough"", Bond has to risk his life to save ""M"", only to lose her near the end to her combat wounds. It's funny how Bond can get shot by Money Penny and survive, but ""M"" dies from a little flesh wound in the side. I also thought MI6 could have sent in some Royal reinforements to fend off two waves of commando's that came against Bond, ""M"", and the caretaker of the Skyfall estate.  But then it might not have been as dramatic.

Adele's Academy award-winning theme song adds to my growing collection of Bond movie music.  It is good to have the Bond series return to the style of music of the earlier films. The theme song selections for Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were not so good.",1363996800,,1182,4.408256880733945

5034586,5,B006X040NY,"The Daniel Craig movies have really injected new life into the James Bond franchise, but ""Skyfall"" is possibly one of the best Bond movies EVER.

This movie is not just a brilliant Bond movie, or a brilliant spy thriller, but a brilliant movie in general -- beautifully filmed, combining the old-school James Bond formula with a very 21st-century brand of terrorism. But what truly elevates this beautiful movie is Sam Mendes' focus on both Bond and M, and the terrible costs of living their lives.

A hard drive containing information on double agents is stolen in Istanbul, and Bond (Daniel Craig) nearly manages to get it back. But he's accidentally shot by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. He's not dead, obviously -- but he uses this as a chance to retire to a tropical island.

But then MI6 is hacked by a cyberterrorist, and their headquarters is blown up. Bond reappears in London to offer his services to his country again, but he's obviously not fit for duty -- physically or psychologically. Despite this, M (Judi Dench) sends him back out to find the cyberterrorists before more agents are killed.

The trail leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent who specializes in cyberterrorism. He blames M for his torture and mutilation, and is determined to destroy her career before killing her. Even capturing Silva isn't enough to stop him, and soon Bond must flee London with M to make a final stand against Silva.

If there is a underlying question to ""Skyfall,"" it is this: Does an old-fashioned agent like James Bond belong in a world of cyberterrorism and individual extremism? Well, yes. The nature of conflict, evil and cruelty will never change, only the media through which they are spread. It's expressed in a lovely speech by M, which seems to say, ""So what if it's the age of Bourne and Fast & Furious? Bond is timeless.""

But Sam Mendes does sow some seeds of doubt about the ""old guard"" -- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.

Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.

The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.

Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.

But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.

""Skyfall"" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character. The next Bond movie will have a tough act to follow.",1363996800,,3671,4.765354330708662

Lots of action, some sly in-jokes and homages to quiet those who thought the series had been stripped of all humor, and the reintroduction of a few classic elements to remind everyone this is still James Bond, not Jason Bourne.  Craig really sells the ""aging but still tough"" aspect.

GoldenEye coyly ASKED whether Bond still mattered in the modern age but then swept the question under the rug.  Skyfall has the moxy to SHOW Bond aging, off his game and out of his element.  It's actually willing to EXPLORE the question of his relevance.  To paraphrase M, the spy isn't less relevant in today's world... in fact, spies are more relevant than ever.

Had a few predictable moments and a few twists and not as much humor as I would have liked. Slow at times and fast paced the remainder, it will keep you engaged for the most part.

5034642,5,B006X040NY,"The Daniel Craig movies have really injected new life into the James Bond franchise, but ""Skyfall"" is possibly one of the best Bond movies EVER.

This movie is not just a brilliant Bond movie, or a brilliant spy thriller, but a brilliant movie in general -- beautifully filmed, combining the old-school James Bond formula with a very 21st-century brand of terrorism. But what truly elevates this beautiful movie is Sam Mendes' focus on both Bond and M, and the terrible costs of living their lives.

A hard drive containing information on double agents is stolen in Istanbul, and Bond (Daniel Craig) nearly manages to get it back. But he's accidentally shot by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. He's not dead, obviously -- but he uses this as a chance to retire to a tropical island.

But then MI6 is hacked by a cyberterrorist, and their headquarters is blown up. Bond reappears in London to offer his services to his country again, but he's obviously not fit for duty -- physically or psychologically. Despite this, M (Judi Dench) sends him back out to find the cyberterrorists before more agents are killed.

The trail leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent who specializes in cyberterrorism.  He blames M for his torture and mutilation, and is determined to destroy her career before killing her. Even capturing Silva isn't enough to stop him, and soon Bond must flee London with M to make a final stand against Silva.

If there is a underlying question to ""Skyfall,"" it is this: Does an old-fashioned agent like James Bond belong in a world of cyberterrorism and individual extremism? Well, yes. The nature of conflict, evil and cruelty will never change, only the media through which they are spread. It's expressed in a lovely speech by M, which seems to say, ""So what if it's the age of Bourne and Fast & Furious? Bond is timeless.""

But Sam Mendes does sow some seeds of doubt about the ""old guard"" -- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.

Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.

The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.

Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.

But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.

""Skyfall"" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character. The next Bond movie will have a tough act to follow.",1363737600,2,3672,4.765354330708662

5034653,3,B006X040NY,"Skyfall was only an ok movie in my view because all the major scenes make those at MI6 into amateurs instead of a top-shelf professional organization. It would be similar to a basketball game, you start out playing really hard, then you see your teammates are goofing off, then the coach tells you to pass the ball and that player shoots from half court at the wrong basket, so you go into the locker room by yourself and shake your head and have a martini. That's how I felt after watching Skyfall. Not as much Bond (until his decision to go to Skyfall that makes them sitting ducks), but more with the other agents (not finishing off the thief in the very beginning, being infiltrated, not watching the prisoner, etc), and in every scene I kept wondering how they could all be such an amateur organization. I actually like Daniel Craig as James Bond and I think he did fine acting this limiting script in Skyfall. I thought Quantum was alright, and I thought Casino Royale was pretty good (and the ending of CR was amateurish as well but at least CR had some action scenes, but every scene in Skyfall was like they were a bunch of amateur agents. The plot and ending of Skyfall was for a changing of the M guard for yet another future Bond movie. On a side note, I sent a box of dvds in for the Trade-In program, and it appears the Skyfall dvd was lost at the merchant's facility, fortunately Amazon was nice to understand and credit me the amount so thanks Amazon for the kind customer service, so I was going to do the Trade-In more often, but after the stress from the merchant's mistake from now on I will never Trade-In again. Eventhough it did not match the hype, Skyfall is still just an ok movie that a Bond fan will find it worth watching on tv or renting or buying cheaper, if only to prepare for the next Bond movie.",1363737600,,1829,4.366568914956011

After Bond does everything short of walking on water, he still fails in protecting ""M"".  Moneypenny was a pleasant surprise. It was refreshing to see Bond as a human being, not just a cartoon character.

It was nice to see Bond with a minimal of gadgets, however, the special effects people were too over the top.  The pyrotechnics were overdone and the ease with which the bad guys simply walk up and gun down security at Parliament, walk into a hearing and blow away the good guys was too much!

5034685,4,B006X040NY,"As an aficianado of the James Bond film series, one of the ongoing problems has been the absence of high quality directors and scriptwriters to create more compelling films and to re-invent the characters. At the inception of the series, Terence Young created a template for the Bond character, adding dimensions that were not found in the Ian Fleming books. Young, with the active participation of Sean Connery, decided how Bond would look, the style and manner of his clothing, they injected the elements of tongue in cheek humor the came to define the series, and Young , with production designer Ken Adam, created the distinctive look of the films, with sleek sets and special effects. When the producers, Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson decided to re-boot the series in 2006, by casting Daniel Craig as a more rough hewn, realistic Bond, they also made a conscious effort to bring the films back to their roots. After the success of Casino Royale, expectations for the series were raised, however, after the disappointment of Quantum Of Solace, a somber, poorly directed film, there was cause for concern regarding the future of the Bond series. The producers uncharacteristically, decided to hire an Oscar winning director, Sam Mendes [American Beauty, Road To Perdition], and a highly regarded screenwriiter, John Logan, to helm the new Bond film, Skyfall. The results are spectacular. The new film is beautifully shot; the cinematography by Roger Deakins was nominated for an Oscar, the script is excellent, the direction and pacing is brisk and Mendes clearly has a genuine affinity for the Bond character and a desire to make a high quality film. The casting of Javier Bardem as Silva, a rogue agent who has a vendetta against Judi Dench's M is inspired; the expansion of Dench's character gives Dench an opportunity to fully display her considerable talents and the addition of a new ""Q"", who is a computer expert and a new Moneypenny, Naomie Harris, who is well cast, gives the film a boost. The supporting roles are beautifully executed, with kudos to Ralph Fiennes, and Albert Finney, who is almost unrecognizable as the caretaker of the Scottish estate where Bond was raised and where the climax of the film takes place. [Wouldn't it have been a treat to have had Connery himself portray the role] There are nostalgic touches, such as the introduction of the original Aston Martin DB5 that was driven by Bond in Goldfinger and Thunderball, with the same license plates and the presentation of a new Walther PPK to Craig's Bond, which responds only to his grip. There is a conscious effort by Mendes and Logan to highlight the backstory of Bond's childhood and parents, and to develop the personal relationship between Bond and M. As everyone now is aware, the film was a critical and a commercial success, earning in excess of a billion dollars between domestic and international receipts. While it is frustrating that Mendes was unable to commit to direct the next Bond film, hopefully, the producers will bring in a comparable director for the next project and endeavor to maintain the same high level of excellence for the Bond series.",1363737600,,3157,4.958490566037736

5034692,4,B006X040NY,"The opening credits were beautiful and true to the Bond tradition.  I love Adele, and her haunting Skyfall song just fit perfectly.  Daniel Craig was great again as Bond, although we got a little tired of them beating the ""old dogs"" theme.  Yes, he's older.  Can he still perform?  That seemed to be the central taunt of the movie, and it did get a bit tiresome.  Also (spoiler), I expected more of a story with the love interest; as her life ended abruptly, there was no more story.  That was disappointing.  Overall, I would recommend this to a friend.  A very enjoyable date movie.",1363737600,,584,4.538461538461538

5034696,4,B006X040NY,Daniel Craig has done an excellent job portraying Ian Flemming's spy / assain James Bond.  All three of the Daniel Craig Bond films are excellent.  Although no one can beat Sean Connery; Daniel Craig comes in at a VERY close second.,1363737600,,232,4.634146341463414

5034704,3,B006X040NY,"After all the hype--and even by Hollywood standards of hype, this was HYPED, I expected more . . . but really, how much further can the franchise push the car-chase, babe-a-thon, six-pack-abs and simpering ever-so-slightly-swishy bad guy thing?

Dull.  Predictable. Even boring at times. Daniel Craig, the hardest working man in showbiz (and in fantasy-MI6 hardest working man in espionage), falls flat in this one, though his character (presumably James Bond) DOES get one wondering:  what's wrong with this man?

The one ray of light:  Thiennes as the future M.

The movie stopped and started constantly and about every 20 minutes or so would stop all together. We switched over to another service and watched a movie there.  We didn't have the same problem with other service, so it was definitely on Amazons' end. Not very impressed.",1363737600,,420,4.441558441558442

5034714,5,B006X040NY,Absolutely adore this film. The bluray is top-notch. The part that most impressed me though is that those stupid ads that always play on many of my Blurays and DVDs only play on the first run for this one (especially good because they have two Taken 2 trailers on the same damn disk.

5034715,1,B006X040NY,"Wow, I enjoyed every other Bond film ever made.  I read most of the novels.  This is the worst cinematic expression of these characters.  I was waiting for the scene where Bond and ""M"" might watch some Jeopardy together (action sequence).  Was there a point to shooting Bond off the train ?  I think it was to fool the stunt team.  This should be edited down to 15 minutes and then film the rest of the missing story. When I see the dvd price, I'm thinkin, You're gonna have to pay me a bunch more to watch this again.",1363737600,5,518,4.181818181818182

5034717,3,B006X040NY,"I love Daniel Craig in most of his acting roles, but for me something was missing in this movie.  The role he played in this movie was much more serious and I believe his character seemed depressed which is something new for the 007 character.  I still love the old 007's that always have a smile on their face and take everything, including torture, in stride.  They tried to sell us on the fact that 007 was old and washed up in this movie, but with Daniel Craig's perfectly sculpted, fit body it was a very hard sell.  I don't like to think of 007 as old and washed up so to me it didn't seem to fit with a 007 movie at all.  There should have been more sexy places, more beautiful people and more rolling around in the bed scenes because that's what I expect to see in a 007 movie.  Otherwise, it's just not the same.  I enjoyed the movie, but wasn't thrilled.",1363651200,2,864,4.168674698795181
5034718,1,B006X040NY,"What is going on , I have no idea , 007 was about something different than old people that need to retire , don't they have new actors anymore to bring some energy , watching this was like spaghetti in oil , the second part was little better than the beginning but still it was not the usual James B anymore and forgotten 10 min after , I had a sense of everyone being tired acting lol

I've seen bad movies, I've laughed about plot holes, funny acting, absurd actions, but this one made me speechless. This movie is in so many ways against simple human logic so I was left wondering ""Enh?"".",1363651200,3,376,4.309859154929577

Too bad, as I waited with bated breath for the studio to pull its head out of yon dark hole and release skyfall. Not going to help their cause if they keep releasing bond movies like this. When the bad guy wants to see the world burn for his/her personal gain, I'll come back to the party.

Javier Bardem is a great match for 007, and the introduction of some new characters joins the old and the new very neatly. I'm looking forward eagerly to the next Bond.

Skyfall is a return to the Bond movies we know and love and consider it to be much better than the previous two.  Three and a half stars.

Spoiler alert.

Despite the unrealistic conclusion to the the opening sequence (where the agent only shoots Bond but doesn't take another shot at the evildoer) and the overly long climax (is there an editor in the house?), this Bond movie was very enjoyable.  The opening credit sequence was extraordinary, well orchestrated with the song by Adele.  I'm glad they continue that tradition.

But it does not rise to the same bar as Casino Royale.  Don't get me wrong; it has all the Bond film attributes: action followed by action, great villain (Javier Bardem gives a classic creepy performance), sex interests, interesting cinematography of landscape and tubescape, and macho cool. I am not sure what separates the two films for me.  Perhaps, it is the novelty of Casino Royale's portrayal of Bond learning that having attachments in his occupation comes with the risks of being hurt.  Skyfall track more closely with the 50-year tradition of Bond films--the Bond who is emotionally cool in all situations, even when close to an emotional freefall as in Skyfall.",1363564800,,837,4.705479452054795

Even after 50 years the action is great and the story is entertaining from beginning to end. Adele's opening song ""Skyfall"" really sets the tone for the entire movie. Her voice is perfect for the elegance and sophistication shown throughout the movie.

The movie starts out with a mission and James Bond is shot. Afterwards, he disappears untraceable until the agency is under attack. Not sure who their enemies are, they cannot trust anyone until they find who is responsible for killing the other agents. Bond does what he does best and tracks down the man responsible for tearing down the agency. Bond ends up having to save the very person who may have been responsible for his misfortunes.

5034818,5,B006X040NY,"The long running James Bond series (50 years and counting) has faced a lot of challenges over the years including having to change cast and dealing with studio bankruptcy. But probably the single biggest challenge it has faced is the end of the cold war. For years it struggled to find a direction that made sense in the modern world, with varying levels of success.

When the franchise rebooted with _Casino Royale_ they stripped things down to the bare bones with a more brutal Bond. While not universally popular the move was met with considerable acclaim. They also started to introduce a new organisation as an opponent for Bond. But with the critical failure of _Quantum of Solace_ that has fallen by the wayside.

Instead what we get is perhaps the most personal Bond movie to date and quite probably the most personal we will ever have. Because there's material here you really can't call on a second time.

The amazing Judi Dench as *M* gets a lot of attention this time round and deservedly so. Everything is personal in this movie. The relationship between M and Bond which has been central to the reboot is explored at length with Bond, perhaps feeling betrayed for the first time and realizing that he is just a piece on the board. We find out just a little bit about Bond's background too. About his parents and where he grew up. And even the villain is personal, at least for M.

Of course since it is a Bond movie we also have some epic action set pieces. From the opening chase (which leads into a great Bond style credit sequence) to the explosion at Skyfall house there's no shortage of action.

And there are new characters too with the introduction of Q, and Moneypenny. Both have been reinvented and modernized but at the same time they are at their core the characters they always were. Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory is worth watching throughout the movie to see how our understanding of the character changes, even though the character doesn't really change at all.

And, perhaps playing into the fact it was the 50th anniversary there are a lot of very Bond moments going on throughout. We have a casino, we have a dead lover, a familiar car shows up. I didn't find any of these disrtacting though and perhaps most impressive at no point in the 2 hour and 30 minute running time was I bored.

Easily one of the best Bond movies and I really wonder where they will go next with the franchise.",1363478400,,2418,4.5704387990762125

5034831,3,B006X040NY,"No spoilers... nobody's going to read this review anyway because it's all been said before.

So, this is the 50th Anniversary of the Bond franchise, and it has been a very enjoyable one overall!  I didn't dislike ""Skyfall"", but thought it was so cluttered with ""Bond clichs"" that the whole story began to collapse under the weight of them. To say that the movie was ""predictable"" is the greatest understatement of all.

Certainly, in my opinion, Daniel Craig is the most engaging, compelling, and credible Bond of them all, so no criticism is directed at him, but again and again throughout the movie I kept thinking that Craig was wasted in this thing!  The first two Bond movies starring Craig were, again in my opinion, far, FAR more enjoyable and entertaining.

Looking forward, it is obvious that there are going to be some personnel changes in the roles surrounding Bond, and I'm not particularly enthused by what I see in that area, either.  Perhaps the best days of this franchise are over... there's only so many boring sequences and other defects in a movie that any actor, even one as good as Daniel Craig, can compensate for.",1363478400,,1137,4.746192893401015

The Bond folks took their time on this one, because if they blew this like they did on Quantum of Solace, the Bond franchise would be over.  I ordered it a day or so after it came out and got it in just a few days.  Amazon is the best.",1363478400,,366,3.776315789473684

5034839,5,B006X040NY,"I loved this film, however, the ending left me a wee bit sad.  Plenty of good action, bits of humor and a bit more info on Bond as well as M.  As with most Bond films, the action moves so quickly, that the film never bogs down.  Daniel Craig is excellent in his third outing as Bond and Judi Dench is ALWAYS excellent in her role as M.  I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this to any Bond fan and even newbies to the series should find this quite enjoyable.",1363478400,,458,4.112359550561798

Action driven from the opening scene to the very end there is never a dull moment.  Daniel Craig may be best Bond in a long line of Bonds (with respects to Sean Connery).  Definitely a ""must add"" to any Bond collectionl.",1363478400,,326,4.4

5034845,5,B006X040NY,"One of the best bond movies ever, this bond has taken MI 5 into the 21at century. It also obviously shows that our OO7 spies never last for ever. Overall I give this movie 5 stars",1363478400,,179,4.0
5034846,5,B006X040NY,"For the first time in 22 movies, Bond breaks with the tradition of being mentally invulnerable. Being shot and seriously injured, his recovery takes its toll from his spirit and far from the prying eyes of MI6 he succumbs to booze and self pity. It is not fully clear whether his unsteady hand is due to the alcohol or that it is a consequence of his injury, but fact is that it strongly influences his reflexes and therefore the essence of the Bond character. Even so, Bond averts the threats of exposing all Secret Service agents worldwide. The villain in Skyfall is a product of an Agent gone wrong, presumably on account of misjudgments by M (Judi Dench).
M. plays an exceptionally large part in this movie, which is to be her last Bond performance.
The ending is less victorious and pompous than usual but certainly more credible.
A movie worth watching and definitely a very good Bond at that.",1363478400,,899,4.625
5034847,5,B006X040NY,"Love Daniel Craig as James Bond.  Hope to see more of him.  Like the way this one should more of his beginnings and people from his past.
If you truly love the Ian Fleming 007 stories this is definitely worth watching at least once.
I wish Ian Fleming was able to see how modern technology was able to push his stories into new dimensions!
I bet he would have like Craig's character.

As a fan of the entire Bond catalog, yes even Never Say Never Again, this movie not only fits right in with it's cohorts but actually floats to the top of the pile.  It has all the action, espionage, seduction, gadgets, and beautiful locales you would expect.

5034878,5,B006X040NY,"Just a brief review of the movie, and then a brief review of the blu ray.

First, I'm a huge Bond fan, but that doesn't mean I'm going to like it so much instantly.

Is this a ""tight plot / perfect story"" movie? No.
 Are there more than a few plot holes and questions that go strangely unanswered? Yeaop!
 Is this ""the best Bond movie ever""? Hmmm... not as much ....

But... are you going to have a great time watching it? OH YEAH!
 Are you in for a treat? yeaop!
 Are you going to escape to exotic locations for a while and relax?!?  Yes!!
 Are you going to loose yourself in the beautiful women and landscapes? Indeed!
 Is there a devious dark baddy bad guy that you want to love to hate!?!? 100% yes!

It has many of the ""trappings"" of a great movie, it's a bit short on the ""Bond toys"", but there is a small explanation provided, for now at least, and lets hope they change that as they make more movies.

It's got M, and Q and Bond, and that's nearly all you need for a solid Bond movie, and a good time.

As long as you're not expecting something else, you're not going to be disappointed with this purchase!

The blu ray portion,
It plays nicely with a good sound system, and the bigger the screen you can get to watch it, the better you're going to love it!

Not very many extras, but i didn't find myself wandering over too much looking for them for some reason...

The vocals are super crisp and I didn't need to adjust the volume or anything like that hardly ever.

The images are very nicely presented, and the hard work that everyone put in really paid off.

This blu -ray / movie will age well I imagine. In 5, 10 or 20 years, this will still be enjoyable and easy to watch.

if you are unsure to get this or not, just know that if you like / love Bond, you won't be disappointed.

If you don't know Bond well, or at least a fan of Daniel Craig, then this may not be the movie for you, and you'll feel sort of empty for most of the movie.

 But other than that... get the butter, pop corn, soda, and the best seat in the house, cuz it's just this is just about the most fun you are going to have this side of the blu ray player!",1363305600,,2142,4.062052505966587
5034879,5,B006X040NY,"Don't want to bore anybody with repetition of what others have said. Best movie of 2012: Skyfall. Best actor: Daniel Craig. Best actress: Naomie Harris, shared with Judi Dench, of course. Best supporting actor: Javier Bardem. Best Director: Sam Mendes. And Albert Finney, in a class of his own. Well, you get the picture... no pun intended, oh well, take the pun. Seen it four times so far and I intend to purchase the DVD to see it a few times more. Casino Royale was certainly the best Bond movie up to that point. This is even better. Enough said. Back to watching it!",1363305600,,571,4.5

The guy has stones, he has style and he can say a ton without really saying much of anything.  And then theres this film overall.  Just brilliant.  The entire reboot of the 007 franchise had me worried, but its been pulled off with aplomb.  And this is the best of them yet.  Yes, it deserves a place among the 5 best Bond films of all time.

It is incredibly quick-paced and each scene folds into the next seamlessly. Daniel Craig is top notch as Bond, in my opinion the best ever; and Judy Dench is a superb ""M.""  Javier Bardeem breaks the mold a bit by adding a touch of pathos to the perquisite sinister bad guy.

5034899,5,B006X040NY,"I have to say that I used to love Bond movies, but then it seemed that they consisted of some kind of explosion or crash in one scene and then the bedroom scene repeat ad nauseum.  He morphed into some kind of sex manic super hero - rarely scratched or hurt for long, and nothing that some time in bed with obligatory handy female couldn't fix, no character development of any kind.

Because of that, my husband had to convince me to watch the two previous movies in which Daniel Craig starred as Bond before I would commit to a date night to view Skyfall.  When I finally watched them, I was totally hooked. Daniel Craig, in my opinion, is one of the best actors to play the role.  He's intense, he's real, he gets hurt and it's obvious; there are plenty of action scenes, explosions, and lovely leading ladies, but he comes across as much more believable and yet still totally Bond.

We went to the theatre to watch this the first time and it was amazing!  I bought this for my dh for a gift for, of all things, Valentine's Day, because we both enjoy this movie and this actor so very much.  It's got the action for those who MUST see something blown up; the bad guy who has a veneer of normalcy but is chillingly scary because of it - he's over-the-top bad but in a subtle way, if that makes sense; a Bond who plays the part well and is a real, developed main character with emotions; and breath taking scenery that is raw and achingly beautiful.  Ms. Moneypenny is a bit of a surprise, but not necessarily in a bad way, and M is also a true, developed character with emotions as well.

Highly recommended.",1363305600,,1609,4.318936877076412

It carries the same ""punch"" and dynamic cinematography I experienced in the theater just on a smaller scale. I was concerned about the scale but as I stated before I was more than surprised by the results -- in this case I guess size doesn't matter. It can take a while to download if you opt for the highest quality. I went with the lowest and can't imagine it getting any better.

I loved the throwback to using your wits and mind rather than gadgets to outwit your adversary. Bond's vulnerability, M's showing her age and his undying loyalty to her, brings us back to an age of chivalry that we all long for in movies. Javier as the villain is priceless, as a victim of M's win at all cost mentality, where even those you care about are just pieces in a chess game.

5034947,4,B006X040NY,"I've been a life long Bond film and when I first saw Skyfall in the theater I have to admit I was at a loss. I came away really not having enjoyed the film and was curious why I seemed unable to see in it what everyone else was seeming to find in it. Well I bought the film and watched it a second and a third time and I can now say that my initial reaction to the film was completely wrong.

Skyfall is an incredible film. The pace and story are perfect for a Bond venture and the action is engrossing and compelling. Craig delvers yet again. What I thought was perhaps the worst Bond film now has become one of my all time favorites, I can't say enough about BERENICE MARLOHE. She is in my opinion perhaps the best actress to ever grace a Bond film. Even during my initial viewing of the film, her performance stood out. She is as masterful as she is beautiful.

The only down side to the film that I have is the fact that Bond slept with the new Moneypenny. The sexual tension and playful seduction that has always existed between the two characters is destroyed by having them realize it's intentions. The magic that has always been a staple of that unresolved relationship was, I feel, unfortunately destroyed in this film. This is the same type of thing that destroyed the magic in MOONLIGHTING when Willis' character and Shepard's character finally hooked up. After that, nobody cared.",1363219200,,1392,4.412451361867705

5034950,4,B006X040NY,This movie was full of action and the story line was interesting.  It would appeal to both men and women.,1363219200,,105,4.25
5034951,1,B006X040NY,"I suppose they spent a lot of money on this turkey but it doesn't show. I saw it in Blu Ray in my home theater and I found the picture and sound to be very ho-hum. I won't even mention the embarrassing ""acting."" The ""plot"" was positively insulting--and so boring I could easily have turned the damned thing off during The Big Shoot Out (stolen--everything was stolen--from ""Straw Dogs"") at the end. My favorite scene was the hilarious look on ""Bond's"" face when the Evil Villain blows up his Aston Martin (the Goldfinger car they lugged in to please their geriatric fan base and pad this mediocre insult to the comparatively brilliant era of Sean Connery). I can't believe I even rented this thing (action movies are definitely not for me) but I read some glowing review on a Blu Ray site--particularly effusive about picture and sound quality-- and thought what the hey, I'll give it a shot. Of course I knew this was going to be a James Bond movie (check your brain at the door) but this was just awful film making.

This franchise has been worked completely to death...but then, looking at the one thousand four-to-five star reviews, maybe not. I'm reminded of a cartoon of two oldsters coming out of a movie theater, the marquee reads ""Rocky XXII,"" and the old man is saying ""I still like Rocky I the best.""

And a billion dollar box office and 92% positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes? Good God.

Personally I feel slightly tainted...like I've seen a snuff film. No more ""blockbusters"" for me.",1363219200,14,1497,4.6415094339622645

5034962,2,B006X040NY,"The latest entry to the James Bond collection is worthy of one viewing but probably not more.  It starts out with a great chase scene betwen Daniel Craig and a baddy and is followed by a very good theme song but that is where this movie loses its way.  It becomes disjointed and wanders until we get to meet the real villain , none other than Javier Bandem, Mr. Macho himself.  Remember ""No Country for Old Men"" where Javier's performance turned your spine to ice?  Well this isn't a repeat performance.  He is badly miscast as a gay baddy, who despite his best efforts never pulls it off.  Too bad, the way this movie was hyped you would have thought it was another ""Casino Royale"".  So much for hype. Oh, and I still havn't figured out how our hero,(with a high calibre rifle bullet in him) can fall 10 stories from a moving train into a river (head first) then go over a sizeable water fall and still be up and walking around in a short time???",1363132800,,947,4.31638418079096

I did find it refreshing that with the exception of a few loyal gimmicks that they went back to traditional vehicle chases and recognizable hand weapons.

No intention of giving the plot away but it seems that someone has pilfered the list of agents and is intending to dispatch them in a frugal manner.  It is probably M's fault as she is getting old and still insists that there are bad guys lurking around the corner. She is just the type of person to get Bond shot.

For example M's order to have her agent shoot at Bond and the enemy espionage agent makes no sense since if she has been successful in killing the enemy agent, they would have gotten no info about the looted hard drive and it risked killing her best agent (Bond)---which it supposedly did, only to have him some back from the depths of being shot in the chest AND drowning.",1363046400,,474,4.448275862068965

In his three movies, Daniel Craig's Bond has grown from a new 00 agent to one who is older, possibly past his prime.  Bond is more human in this movie, and yet still manages to come out on top.  There are some cool surprises and some sad ones, but nothing matches the interaction between Bond (Daniel Craig) and Silva (Javier Bardem), with the emotional content all tied to M (Judi Dench).",1363046400,,478,4.471264367816092

5034998,5,B006X040NY,This is far and away the best Bond in a long time.  It is head and shoulders above any of the spy thrillers of late.  I thought that  Craig and Dench were absolutely awesome in this film.  In my opinion  there was not a thing to dislike about this film.  Craig was as good as Connery as he brought back the grit and determination as well as finesse that Connery injected into Bond.  This film is so worth the money and I am thrilled to add it to my Bond collection.  I make no recommendations for other people to watch as what I like they would think it stinks. This was so worth the money that I would pay again to see it in a theater and then buy the DVD again.,1363046400,,663,3.9696969696969697

I enjoyed the intellectual suspense, eye candy and drama, while my husband enjoyed those AND the high action scenes.  It was very tense: was 007 going to die this time?  I did not have the suspense figured out, so I enjoyed the whole aspect of the film.  Photography was breathtaking!",1363046400,,394,4.430555555555555

He plays the character almost exactly as Ian Flemming originally wrote the character, not how he was modeled for the movies.

This movie combines classic elements with new flair and sets up the story for more great adventures.  No spoilers here but if you are a longtime Bond fan, the last scene can best be described as Classic!  It made me want to watch the next installment right away!!

5035004,5,B006X040NY,"In Skyfall, Sam Mendes does for James Bond what Christopher Nolan did for The Dark Knight Trilogy... where Sam uses Batman Begins to set up the wonderfully successful Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises sequels.

In so many ways Skyfall is the BEST BOND MOVIE EVER. I enjoyed the action over the last 50 years but Bond has the potential for very deep background and character development. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with many of the bang bang, explosive bonds of past glory. But this is a thinking man's Bond, mirroring a considerably more sophisticated world, and more effort went into plot development than on any previous movie in the series.

Haven't you ever wondered where Bond came from, how he was orphaned, why he is who he is? And M's character is so much more approachable now. In a world where stateless terrorism has taken the place of the old world order, it takes a very special person to be able to run Mi6.

Don't you like how they merged the old with the new. That Aston Martin DB5 was beautiful and I love the connection of how it was saved all these years to ultimately become Bond's savior in Skyfall. With all of its gizmos, it was the Aston's armored steel and machine guns that contrasted with modern cloak and dagger. They don't make spy cars like that anymore. I also loved Skyfall's plot, cinematography, their alternate use of color and night to set the moods.

Unlike ARGO, the suspense in Skyfall was amazing. You never could have guessed that Skyfall would end with a NEW beginning.",1363046400,,1530,4.613970588235294
5035005,4,B006X040NY,"The title of this post sums it up - finally saw it on dvd 2 days ago.  A good Bond movie - I enjoyed it - but I was a little disappointed.  I think part of it is how much it has been talked up, people even saying it should have been nominated for best pic.  Well, it isn't THAT good.  Here's the whole thing - the opening 15 minutes were great.  Then a lull, then kind of slow, then when Bardem shows up, the movie gets really really good.

So the thing is...you have the opening, then kind of slow and boring until Bardem shows up, and then the last hour is really good - Judie Dench is great in this.  This movie could have been shorter.  I have seen it one time, maybe I will feel differently after another view.  But besides the opening, the movie is kind of boring until Bardem shows up.

Confusing too - I don't think the storytelling is good at all in the first hour and 20 minutes - could have been a clearer story - I still don't know what Bond was doing when he jumped on the elevator and went up there and he let that guy shoot the other guy.  Didn't understand that.  I mean I think that was the guy on the train at the beginning, but how did Bond find him and I don't have a clue who he shot.  That part of the movie, besides just that scene, was muddled and unclear.  Didn't like that.  But I didn't like the confusing first hour and a half.

Daniel Craig was good, and as you can tell, I really liked Bardem in it.  Unique Bond villain, yet classic.  I liked this movie, but I think the hype hurt it in my eyes because I expected more.

To help you and know where I am coming from in case you are a Bond fan and you want to know my tastes - I have 4 fave Bond movies - For Your Eyes Only is my favorite, followed closely by Spy Who Loved Me and Goldfinger, and then Die Another Day.  If I had to pick a 5th fave - it would be a tie between Dr No (for Ursula alone) and From Russia With Love.........old man :)  .  Those are my favorite.

4/5 for Skyfall though.",1363046400,,1976,3.9343434343434343

The scene where Roger Moors bond kicks the mercedes over the cliff was priceless .The ski chase,and mountain climbing scenes were great also. A close second is Golden  Eye ,but only because of the femm fatale played by Famke Janson. When she has an orgasm while killing inocent soviet scientists with an AK47 was fantastic. The look she gets from her superior officer is priceless. Then there is SKYFALL. and I have to say that it is by far the best Bond movie of all time. I have to say that Danial Craig is The James Bond.  I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. What I saw was unbelievably brilliant. The character development of Bond was very well done. There is one sad scene, but I'm not going to say anymore than that. All I have to say is do not just watch this movie. Buy it. It is that good. You will not regret it.

Daniel Craig is a good Bond but in this film, they played him off like the old man who can barely hold it together or who can't measure up.

5035050,3,B006X040NY,"Right at the outset let me get this out of the way immediately -- I LOVE Daniel Craig as Bond.  He is the quintessential Bond (and the only other Bond portrayer I like is Mr Sean Connery).

This 3 star rating is not due to Daniel Craig whatsoever; i give him 5 stars.  The 3 stars are due to the script itself.
Now then to the movie.

There were several points throughout this thing that made me sit in disbelief that Mr Bond, the trained and super efficient killing machine hesitated to finish off Silva.  Yes, hesitated.  For that matter, why was there ever a reason to bring him face to face with M?  Is there any Bond movie that justified having to bring the baddie face to face with the good guys?  And at the opening scenes on the train top in Turkey another agent hesitated.  What the heck?  Arent these agents in the field trained to dispatch efficiently, relentlessly, and without pause until the deed is done, regardless of other agents being down?  And to do so without question and without thinking twice?  Especially if the villain(s) is right there in your sights already or freaking even closer??

Next, as another reviewer already mentioned, why is this list out in the open and in need of being physically chased down?  In the older espionage genre I can accept the possibility that information is placed onto a disc, or tape, or heck microfilm and it had to be handed off.  But for that to be plausible in this technologically advanced era, exposition at the beginning would be crucial to show *why* this list is in need of being chased down and recovered.  Such as why is this laptop with such information in Turkey to begin with?  Because the first thing that came to my mind is, why couldn't said list have been sent electronically via an encrypted code to pretty much anywhere in the world?  The type of complex code that Q has to unlock at some point anyway?  And hey everyone has camera phones these days  so they couldn't take a photo of the list onscreen with a camera phone and just email it?  Or text it?  Seriously.  Show me why and how this plot came to be so that I can then accept it and suspend my disbelief for the movies duration.

Q provides you a spiffy pistol.  Why did you not retrieve it when the dragons ran the other way?  Nonsense.

And so you have Silva in custody.  We are just to accept that he was able to escape his holding cell at a super top security holding facility?  I didn't see any cameras to monitor him so it is a big stretch to accept that he just waltzed out.  If insiders let him out, why not show it?

And now off to Scotland for the standoff.  Why go it alone?  When Mallory okays it he pretty much says do what you need to do, but on the sly.  This translates to the ability to use some secret and highly trained Special Forces and weapons at the minimum to take with you.  Or send along after you.  Covertly.  This is M for chrissake!!  I don't get it.

So a 3 star is what this Bond installment earns, in my book.  I did like a few things.
1) Daniel Craig
2) Though the plot was weak, the acting as good
3) That Land Rover Defender in the opening chase is pretty awesome.  And there is that gorgeous Aston Martin.  ;o)",1362960000,,3183,4.298482293423271

I know Bond fans winced heavily at ""Quantum of Solace"", but ""Skyfall"" really has Craig and the rest of the cast finally gelling into a tight ensemble. Fantastic direction and some unbeatable cinematography combine to keep the audience riveted all the way through, and if the movie is not without its share of genuine heartbreak, it is an homage of love to a 50 year tradition that both sends off some of that history in grand style while simultaneously reinventing itself with an unimaginably slick and timely ""old like new"" re-envisioning of itself.

One can see Daniel Craig is finally confortable in the role as James Bond. One can see the confidence, the stride and all the swagger that the producers wanted this character to have.
Of course with all James Bond films there is always the finding out who the ""villian"" is, why he is out to inflict pain on Bond  or the world and how to stop him.
But in this film there is an interesting subplot. Bond as well as ""M"" faced the dilemma of convincing their colleagues that they as well as their methods are not only still useful but necessary to thwart evil in today's techological world. You can't sit behind a computer and fight evil.
This is an action pack film that will have one riveting in their seat anticipating the next move and surprise when it is displayed on the screen. The special effects were fantastic, the colors vibrant and the sounds explosive.

Daniel Craig however has finally convinced me that it is possible.  He is by far, the best choice to replace Mr. Connery.

It's very hard to lose Judi Dench after being raised adoring her unmatched portrayal as ""M"" - but now days it seems a light thing to kill off major cast members, similarly to the way they also seemingly wrote off the old Aston Martin DB5.

A younger geek replacement for ""Q"" is also a minor twist in the road, but overall Daniel Craig does an excellent job of guaranteeing that Bond fans have much to look forward to without worry. This one had its moments - I don't mean to suggest it was a ""loser"" - or anything like it. But it wasn't as good as the former Bond installments for me -  and so I look forward to the next one.",1362787200,,859,4.131736526946108
5035109,5,B006X040NY,"First let me start by saying that I never really got into any previous Bond movies except for the ones with Daniel Craig....I have seen a bunch of them, they were just not my thing; perhaps its a generation thing.  That does not mean you should dismiss this review as being nonsense or the idea that I do not know what I am talking about.  So let me just say that this movie itself is one of the best movies of 2012.  Most fans would be drawn to the action style of the film, the Bond girls or perhaps even the filming locations.  I was drawn more to the story and mind set of Daniel Craig's character.  It brings home a harsh reality that even the best secret agent cant always be on top of his game.

Even the casual fan like myself will catch some of the references to older Bond films that are sprinkled into the film.  It was quite the treat and often brought a smile.

One of the true treats of the film is the acting performance of Javier Bardem.  Hands down one of the best villans I have ever seen in any movie.  Given the already fragile mindset of Bond in this film if anyone else besides Javier had played the villain it would have made the movie dramatically different.  I am sure there are many other people who will agree with me on that.

I purchased the Blu-ray edition of the film and in typical Blu-ray style the quality is simply amazing. It would have been nice to have the film come in a 7.1 surround sound, but oh well you cant always get what you want.  That fact alone does not effect this review.
Its an easy choice folks, go buy this film.",1362787200,,1566,4.18

5035112,3,B006X040NY,"Considering all the hype, I expected this film to blow me away. I so wanted it to, but it didn't. It seemed to lack that playful/devilish Bond style. It was very serious and a bit on the grim side. Daniel Craig as Bond seemed kind of robotic most of the time.

Other than that, the villain had good motivation. I thought it interesting how it was all about killing M. The action was fun. The opening had a surprise. There were plenty of action/fight scenes. I'd say this was one of the most sophisticated Bonds as far using technology in the plot.

The plot was weak at times. For example, I can't imagine anyone with M's experience making the mistake of using a flashlight in the dark just so the bad guy could find her.",1362787200,,721,4.333333333333333
5035113,4,B006X040NY,"TV and reporters all acted like this is the BEST Bond film of ALL TIME!!!!!
It was good but not the best. The movie starts out great with that train scene but then slows down and gets kind of dull at one point. Many Bond films were just as good as this one if not better, Casino Royale,  The Spy who loved me, Moonraker, Die another day, ect.",1362787200,,342,4.029411764705882
5035114,5,B006X040NY,"I saw this in theaters and loved it.  I don't consider myself a Bond expert, due to the fact that I haven't seen all of the previous Bond films.
I have seen bits and pieces of Connery's Bonds and in my opinion think he was ""The"" Bond during those years.  But alas it's the 21st century.
I've only seen a couple bits and pieces of Moore's Bond due to the fact that I found them to be more comedy than action.  I don't recall any Dalton or Lazenby's Bonds.  Pierce Brosnan's ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was the first Bond that I saw in theaters.

But as I've said... This is now the 21st century.  And this movie in my opinion shows how Bond may be old, but he is still a reliable and highly needed MI6 agent.  Daniel Craig does a good job portraying the ""New"" James Bond.  I've seen and own Casino Royale. And I own Quantum of Solace.

The CR and QofS are both offered as two disk dvds. Skyfall, much to my dismay, is only offered here on Amazon as one disk.  It does have some good ""special features"" it looks like, with one in particular.  Brother-in-law is currently borrowing this.

5035125,5,B006X040NY,"Truly dives deep into what makes Bond tick, with yet another great cast. Of course, Bond has the most screen time, followed only by Judi Dench's M. But other than that, the rest of the cast at first seems like they don't get enough screen time. However, this is not the case - their roles may be smaller, but just as significant. The action scenes are really not the highlight. What makes this particular entry standout is the wry humor, gut-wrenching suspense (shrouded in enough mystery to last you for a lifetime), and the clever homages to the older films. The best Bond film of the Craig era, no contest whatsoever. I've never seen any of the others, so I can't compare it to those, but I have no doubt this one could hold its own against whatever the earlier films (before Craig) could bring to the table.

This Bond seems to put thing of Bond's past to and end, especially his personal possesions.

I love ""Casino Royale"" as well as ""Quantum of Solace"" and am solid in my opinion that Daniel Craig has created the single best version of James Bond in the entire Bond world, and that consistency continues in ""Skyfall"", even with the the movie having such a different look and feel.

5035154,4,B006X040NY,"Don't get me wrong, this movie was highly entertaining. I certainly recommend it. And the actors were lovely. Sam Mendes did a nice job with this twenty-third (or is it more?) Bond film. The only thing about it that nags at me a bit is that there is so much in the plot that doesn't make an awful lot of sense.

The good things first, and there are plenty of them. As we would expect with a Bond movie, the exotic locales and cinematography are stunning, the chase and fight scenes cleverly shot, and the women are beautiful. (Although the ladies, frankly, don't have much to do; this is definitely a guy's world.)  Best of all are the actors (which is nice, since many of us don't bracket ""Bond films"" and ""acting"" in the same thought). Daniel Craig is quite an effective James Bond. He may be a bit stone-faced, but who wouldn't be, after years in the Secret Service as a Double O agent? He has charisma and presence, and his dry delivery works for the role. I particularly liked his interactions with the truly fun-to-watch M-obsessed villain, Raoul Silva, played to the gleeful hilt by the masterful, versatile Javier Bardem. As M, the MI6 boss with an iron will, and ethics I consider a bit shaky, Judi Dench is also a pleasure to watch. Ralph Fiennes, another renowned thespian, does a turn as Mallory, a government official, in charge of national security, who is both angered by and protective of the indomitable M. Two old-new characters are reborn, so to speak, as young MI6 operatives: Naomie Harris as a pretty field agent--oops, can't give too much away--called Eve, and Ben Whishaw as Q, the Head of Q Branch and purveyor of weapons and tech gadgetry. Mr Whishaw, a stage and screen actor of impressive range and chameleon-like ability, gives Q's youthful arrogance an appealing edge. With a cardigan, rather than a lab coat, draped over his delicate frame, and a flutelike voice that contrasts with Bond's harsher tones, he represents the future of the Secret Service--cyber espionage as opposed to the old-school, hands-on, shoot 'em or shag 'em variety of spying we associate with Bond. As a result, Q and Bond's snarky exchanges have a touch of humor that is both charming and ironic. Rory Kinnear, another acclaimed stage actor, is fine as Tanner, M's stoic right-hand man.

As for the holes in the plot, now that I come to think of it, they really aren't much more than a casual annoyance. What's with the stolen Modigliani? Oh well, I suppose it was just another of Silva's sideline jobs. Why leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, when you aren't going to provide Bond with some kind of backup, any kind of backup? Why didn't Bond himself call for backup when he found that his arsenal had been sold, and all that was left to him was a rather old rifle? Why lead the villains to a remote Scottish manor, where there was no likelihood of support from The Good Guys? Why did the old gamekeeper Kincaid--played by Albert Finney--use a very visible flashlight on the moors, for pity's sake?

Since this is a Bond movie, I guess those things don't matter. Common sense doesn't really matter in the world of MI6 espionage. We're all just in it for the fun.",1362700800,,3180,4.632978723404255

The biggest bummer for me was that they took what could have been an excellent story line, and very decent screenplay, and with the addition of few over-the-top Hollywood inclusions the movie went from excellent to average. Instead of continuing with the fundamentally flawed but genuine Bond from Casino Royale, that Daniel Craig portrayed so diliegently, the producers decided to revert to the less-than-believeable and egotistical Bond from the Roger Moore days. You think they would have learnt their lessons.

5035173,5,B006X040NY,Very exciting.  I do not like this format and will not participate next time.  I can't change the movie even if I didn't like it.,1362614400,,129,4.12
5035174,5,B006X040NY,"It's hard to believe it's been 50 years since James Bond first hit the big screen and yet this past year had celebrations galore about that fact. First was the release of the blu-ray box set containing all Bond films with extras excluding SKYFALL. Numerous shows were done about the fact. Finally a tribute was paid to Bond this past Oscar night. But the big news concerning Bond this year was a new film, SKYFALL that has just hit DVD shelves.

After the first two outings with Daniel Craig as the titular character, Bond is back and in action like never before. The film opens with the usual chase sequence filled with more action than a half dozen films crammed into about 10 minutes. When it finishes Bond is shot by one of his own team on orders from M (Dame Judi Dench) and falls from a moving train over a high bridge into a roaring river. Cue music and opening credits.

Of course Bond didn't die. If he did then this would have been the shortest Bond film ever made. When the credits finish we find M fighting for the continued role of MI-6 and the need for the spy network set up all these years. It turns out that what Bond was attempting to retrieve (and failed to do) was a hard drive that contained the location and names of all of the undercover spies around the globe. Not only does M suffer that indignation but someone explodes a bomb in her office as well.

Recuperating on some desert island, Bond hears the news and returns to the fold, confronting M in her home. A few details filled in, a new weapon courtesy of a new Q and Bond is off and running. His first lead is the man he was battling on top of the train at the start of the film that results in an extremely well choreographed and filmed fight to the death. The clues lead Bond from Shanghai to Macau and eventually to a meeting with the man behind it all.

Silva (Javier Bardem) has a past with M. He too was one of the high members of MI-6 and a favorite of M. But things went bad (the details of which we learn later) and it appears he has manipulated Bond to this meeting. Bond escapes and captures Silva, taking him back to England. While most of the film up to this point has been setting the stage from here on out it's non-stop action and double crosses resulting in one of the most explosive finales ever captured in a Bond film and one that is more touching than any other.

Visually SKYFALL is an amazing film to watch. The colors of the neon in Shanghai pop off the screen and the action scenes feel as if you are there with Bond in each and every move. Director Sam Mendes isn't known as an action director but he brings a fresh look to the entire film as well as a depth of character to Bond that's rarely if ever been seen.

I saw this film when it was first out and loved it. For Bond geeks there are all sorts of special surprises from locations to items to lines in the film that will make them giddy with glee. Honestly there was at least one moment when I nearly screamed out ""YES!"" that involves a car. 'Nuff said. For those more recently drafted into the Bond films you'll get all the action you need and a story line that has more depths than most.

Of the three Craig Bond films I'm undecided which I like best but I know it's between this one and CASINO ROYALE. One thing is certain. All are movies that should not just be rented but added to your collection. Bond films are movies that can be enjoyed any time and will be for years to come.",1362614400,,3446,4.227963525835866
5035175,5,B006X040NY,"This movie makes up for the lack-luster second movie, Quantum of Solace, in more ways than just it being a Bond movie.

5035178,5,B006X040NY,"I was really critical of my initial viewing of Skyfall. Every Bond movie falls into a pattern, each scene an ingredient polarizing into a fast, fun film. We always have huge charismatic villains, beautiful femme fatales, wonderful toys, and exotic locations.

And the cars.

But Skyfall didn't fit most of the pattern. Sure, they bring back the original Bond Car. But there was no femme fatal. We didn't even get any gadgets. But we got a really creepy and powerful villain. So, I stepped back and watched it for a second time. And that's when it hit me. Skyfall is meant to be a look inside who Craig's Bond really was. And that difference between other Bond movies thrusts Skyfall into one of the best Bond stories, if not the best Bond film. No spoilers -  just give it a go. I can compare Skyfall to Jim Butcher's novel Changes - everything is shaken to the core to get a peek at real motivations and the human fighting spirit conquering all.

Special Features are some of the best I've seen on a BD release since 2011. Tons of behind the scenes, comparisons to previous Bond films, as well as very enjoyable commentary tracks.

Of course, Bond will return. I just hope he can match this new benchmark of the series.",1362614400,,1220,4.527272727272727
5035179,1,B006X040NY,"I talk to my friends.  I talk to the people on the street.  Everyone loves this movie.  And so, if you consider yourself a typical movie-goer, you will apparently love this movie too, so go ahead and buy it!

My review however is for more of the Bond aficionados, and those who look at movies as art, not just mass produced entertainment.

First things first!  These big movies are made by huge publically traded corporations, whose motive is profit.  Period.  Therefore it is financially beneficial to appeal to the masses of humanity, instead of creating a high art value movie that may or may not sell well.

In short..  It really felt like a Dark Knight knockoff in many ways.  And I heard the director admitted to being heavily influenced by Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"".  I could actually feel the contrived plot.  I don't want to enter spoiler territory, but much of the villain plan/plot was ridiculous.

The best part was the beautiful French actress.  She doesn't stay around for long unfortunately.

And why do we need another ""reboot"", after the hugely successful Casino Royale which was only 2 movies ago?  I know ""Quantum of Solace"" was garbage.

The final showdown was beyond ludicrous.

It didn't feel like Bond, and unlike any other Bond movie.. I truly hated it.  Just a feeling.",1362614400,,1302,4.7792792792792795
5035180,4,B006X040NY,They took their time and found a script for their film and fit for a capable cast. They found a capable director who made use of his resources. The 007 series suffered from a lack of patience on the part of producers. I don't blame Sean Connery for looking elsewhere for work. These films were becoming cash cows for the studios. How can you cast The Saint as 007? Roger Moore's films as 007 were plain bad. So I was surprised with Casino Royale and impressed by the consistency from the next two. Not just with Craig but the entire effort. If they take their time and put together a good film I won't hesitate to hold the opinion that these are the best 007 films to date.,1362614400,,673,4.265625

I'm not like some of the people who rate blu-rays. I'm not technically savvy, but I am an artist by trade so I lean towards appreciation of certain aspects of film so I'll comment on those. The crisp details are amazing. The colors are rich and absolutely stunning on a good TV. The sound balance seemed better than some blu-rays I've had where the dialog is drowned out by the music. I know you can (and I often have to) adjust the settings on my TV to compensate for that by adjusting the music-to-voice balance, but I appreciate when I can pop the disc in and it just works.

In fact, Sam Mendes gives ""Skyfall"" a directorial style not seen since Peter Hunt's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" The result is a smashing (if slightly overlong) entertainment. Daniel Craig adds some much-needed humor to a no-nonsense 007 while Javier Bardem's stylish villainy transcends his underwritten role. ""Skyfall"" also provides a grand farewell for Judi Dench's M, who has considerably more screen time than previous installments. A notch below ""Casino Royale"" (2006), but still damn good Bond.",1362614400,,616,5.634408602150538
5035205,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig's Bond was perfect. He looks more mature yet very fit in this role. The premise of the film was that time were changing and that it was no longer obvious enemies in the open but shadowy figures which could lurking within the ranks of the secret service or allies. This also alluded to Bond's personal demons. Judy Dench takes a bow. After an opening sequence where Bond is shot by a new operative, MI6 is forced to concede that their top agent has met his demise. M is somewhat disgraced by mounting losses and is forced with the reappearance of Bond to stem the tide of defeat from a worthy foe. The usual staple of all these films: tobacco, alcohol, call girls, and gambling are present here as the trail of deception and cover-blowing are traced back to a previous operative. At the end Bond must resolve his sense of loss of his parents (and kill the bad guys) at his childhood home in Scotland, aptly named Skyfall.

Goldfinger was the, dare I say, gold standard of Bond films.  Sean Connery WAS James Bond for many of us.  I thought Daniel Craig did an outstanding job in Casino Royal.

Here, he surpasses that movie.  I do believe that Goldfinger and Sean Connery have been replaced as the gold standard.  Javier Bardem is a totally creepy villain - maybe not as creepy as in No Country for old Men, but darn close.  Has he found a new calling for playing bad guys?

I really like that they cut down on the gimmicks and actually had a good story.

Daniel Craig has definitely taken up the mantle and taken this role over the top. His 007 is exactly what I would expect of a British secret agent: impeccably dressed, rugged yet good looking, perpetually stony-faced, but with perfect wit and dry humor.

M (Dame Judy Densch) is fabulous, holding her head up in spite of all the crap falling around her, and the suggestions of early retirement. Her relationship with Bond is so painfully evident in this movie, the sweet ending scene...sorry, all I can say without spoilers.

Skyfall begins as most every Bond film does: the impossible car chase from which all but the good guys are dispatched. But it continues with more depth and a better, simpler story than previous movies. For me it had more overall feeling, revealing a bit more depth to the elusive Mr Bond. The beautiful girls are present and accounted for, as is the almost appealing villain, played creepily well by Javier Bardem. You can actually see his point, however skewed it may be, and almost empathize with him; how he might be right, how MI6 could be seen as immoral.

Yes I enjoyed it, and I will see it again. Yes, there will be folks who will absolutely hate it, for reasons which could include the deviation from Bonds of old. But aren't movies just for fun anyway? If nothing else, you can look at attractive people, places you'll likely never visit, and some gorgeous cars :)",1362528000,,1521,4.7320754716981135

The 3rd installment in the new Bond saga have been as good as any made since Connery took his martini shaken not stirred. The action is spectacular and emotionally it is super charged with James being taken back to his home where his parents met their demise. The villain is played superbly by Javier Bardem and just thinking of his cold eyes gives me chills even now.
If you are a die hard fan then the choice is obvious. Buy this movie and enjoy the new Mr Bond and remember some of the old times as well. You won't be disappointed.

MI6's response not believable, it would be akin to a rogue ex-police officer, insane and annoyed by treatment from a previous supervisor, deciding to attack that police department, and under attack, the police department having only a few old six shooters to aid in its defense.  Most audiences would not believe it.  Instead, the fictitious MI6 would have many, many more resources than those presented in the film should a rogue ex-agent attack them, and the head of their agency holed up in an isolated house under the protection of a single agent and his gamekeeper is unconvincing.  With the layers of security most modern states are likely to have since 9/11, not believable that M and 007 would be the only ones deciding how to defend the head of MI6.  After all, the rogue ex-agent basically declared war on the state, and though he was presented as brilliant (I saw no brilliance, only insanity), the state would also have brilliant employees, and many more of them. No matter the rogue's resources, the state's would exceed them.  So I didn't believe act 2 or 3; also as M was so willing to allow her agents to die, I wondered how the fictitious MI6 in this story could possibly attract or keep employees who would know that the state didn't have their back.  Bond's return was explained by saying he was extremely patriotic, but even he was miffed into taking an unapproved leave upon discovering that M would sacrifice his life for the greater good.  I know nothing about espionage, but just common sense, why would a person sacrifice their life for a state which would not have their back, or at least, have it to a greater extent than that portrayed in this film.  I mean these agents risk their lives, of which they have only one.  The willingness to discard agents was necessary in this story, to show that M operated this way with agents, so it was understood why she would allow the villain to be sacrificed, but then the audience just asks, how is she able to keep agents? Who would work for her?  In 007 films, field agents frequently are in gun battles, it is extremely high risk.  A state would get a reputation for putting it's agents in high risk situations, and not having their back when the **** hit the fan.  It would be very hard to recruit top people.  So basically the story not presented in a believable manner.  If the filmmakers were determined to have the scenario of 007, M, and the gamekeeper isolated and fending off the madman and his goons on their own, then they needed, in the story, to better explain how their isolation came about.  Just having M and 007 deciding, on their own, that that was how the situation would play out was insufficient.  The story itself needed to prove how M and 007 could have such authority, and how the other high security agencies in England were obliged to accept their decision.  The head of MI6 is shown to have power in this story, but in this story, the entire state was under attack, not just M, and it is unbelievable that only M and a trusted agent would have final say in this fictitious situation.  Say, for example, the prime minister was under attack, would he be able decide, by himself, with one of his aids, to fight off the attacker, even if a sole agent went with him.  No, especially if the attacker had killed other citizens as well.  No single person has that much authority; I believe state security to be a multi-agency responsibility, especially under terrorist threat, which this villain was.  Strengths of the movie - actors, pacing, action.  I found a subplot believable, the lover shared by Bond and the villain (forget her name); she was sold into sex slavery as a child, bought by a sadist and then murdered by him.  She bet on Bond, hoping he could help her, even trying to get him to avoid the villain.  Under orders he could not do so, but the violence suffered by this woman character, her fear, so convincingly portrayed by the talented actress, was very believable.  In a world where many women daily are murdered by the men in their lives, I yearn to see better options for women in film and in reality.",1362441600,,4340,4.579560155239327

5035263,4,B006X040NY,"These last Bond films starring Craig are the most psychologically screwed up. That makes them awfully interesting.

M is played as a woman who has learned to let nothing, not even the lives of her agents stand in the way of her missions. Bond, oddly (or perhaps not) has formed an attachment to her that transcends the norm. She too, seems to have an alarming tie to him, yet has no hesitation sacrificing him. A decision I found immediately questionable. Her best bet was not to disable or kill her senior agent who actually had his hands on the target.

We learn more about Bonds' childhood, though only a few details, and more innuendo than clear detail. A damaged child, childhood trauma, ripe for the picking as it were when M came dangling the carrot.

Mentioned more than a few times as if he is worth remembering (?) if not worth saving...Ronson, who is in the first office scene dying. I can't help but wonder who is he? Have I forgotten him? There is the requisite high number of persons killed along the way who aren't mentioned at all.

I suppose that Q is sort of quirky and cute-ish in a Dr Spencer Reid sort of way, and Ralph Fiennes is always good to watch.

The shaving scene was not sexy. Big fail there. No chemistry. Obligatory flirting, except for the one anemic try at her bra, more like a man and woman discovering they don't like each other sexually much at all, no matter how hard they tried.

The beautiful Miss Moneypenny should have had the balls to make her own decision about the shot where she hit Bond. As the agent in place she new her chances and the situation better than M. That is one of the things that makes Bond such a good field agent, he thinks on his feet, and he has the nerve to do as he thinks necessary instead of just doing as he's told.

Loved the dramatic explosions, and the insane Silva (Javier Bardem), I found myself curious why he was chosen besides his beautiful voice and captivating acting. His asymmetric features and the horrible prosthesis I suppose made him an ideal, nauseating bad guy. A psychopath nurtured in M's breast and not a little bit by her own hand.

The much touted Silva/Bond chest stroking scene was understated, Bond entirely unfazed, barely surprised, and certainly not panicked. Pretty clear it wasn't going to make him freak out. Not as courageously horrifying as the Casino Royale naked scene, Bond tied to a fenestrated chair with the knot swinging bad guy.

Is it only on the AIV that the sex scenes are only hinted at and cut rather harshly after a few vague seconds? Why include those disconnected bits at all?

So. I did enjoy the viewing. Still think Casino Royale is the best Craig-as-Bond offering. Was sorry to see Judi Dench leave. But nice to meet the new Q. I half expected Q to reach over and give Bond the thigh squeeze rather than Silva later on. (I could see Benedict Cumberbatch in the role).

Fewer fantabulous gadgets than earlier Bond films. And the repeated emphasis on being too old got to me. Annoying. Experience has to count for something. Well, part of that equation was put to bed by the demise of M. Yet there looms the question, how much longer will Bond be able to cut it as a double O?

But...go for it, it is worth a viewing or two. Especially if you hold a marathon of all the Craig Bond movies.

This is beyond question in the top three of all Bond movies, the only others being (insert YOURS here) for me being Goldfinger and Casino Royale (the original). It's determimative of the future of the Bond legend; the previously impervious MI6 and Great Britain are shown to be very human and therefore vulnerable to the monomaniacally perfect personification of evil, Javier Barden, who does not, evidently, have the ability to make a bad film. This is the most human of all the Bond movies; the Bond women in the film are three dimensional, which is as we all know,  is quite an achievement in itself. From a video quality perspective, the BluRay transfer is just perfect. The 5.1 HD mix is excitingly perfect.

I like too that the action becomes between Bond and the bad guy (forget his name, but he is type cast in the bad guy role, but he does play a despicable guy), and that the Good/Evil relationship is played out mano a mano, vs, one guy against the world-destroying-evil guy.

*******************************************************************************

Warning - stop now if you have not seen the film.  Spoilers are coming

*******************************************************************************

I didn't like how the white slave girl was killed during the target pistol challenge to Bond.  Bond makes his move to fight right after she's shot instead of before in order to save her.  It should have been written differently. He had more or less given her hope he would save her on the boat.  The Bonds of the past films would have done more for her.  This Bond hardly seemed fazed by her impending death.

The villain was played very well.  You could even understand his hatred for M.  Problem is that his escape from the cell and the way he played Bond's agency made them all look like total knuckleheads.  Would it have hurt to put a good padlock on his cell in addition to electronic doors?  They knew their systems had already been compromised once.

I thought the way it ended with Judi Dench's M dying was a mistake too.  I know they were going for the emotional impact.  Maybe it was how she paid for the lives of the agents she'd sacrificed.  She was even willing to write off Bond if it meant saving more agents. Now it was her turn. The problem for me was Bond had spent the last part of the film doing everything in his power to save her life.  He even totally destroyed his ancestral home. And worst of all the classic Aston Martin from Goldfinger.  It was so nice to see the car back, then they totally destroy it.  It was so silly that M escaped onto the moors through a hidden passage only to then start walking with a bright flashlight.  In the dark that flashlight showed exactly where she was to her pursuers. She might as well have sent up a flare !  Then she hides in the only other building left standing.  If they had simply hidden on the moors in the dark with the flashlight out they never would have been found.  Also, there should have been an army there to help protect her after the attack.  Instead she has only Bond.  If they were using this as a way to show that Bond still had what it takes to be the best, they should not have made all his efforts to save her be in vain.  The ending I would have preferred was her retiring.  Maybe even hinting that she was going to have some sort of relationship with that grounds keeper and retire to a simple life for her final years.",1362355200,2,2893,4.514450867052023

The majority of the film took place in dark caverns, underground, train sub stations or in the dark.  It was difficult to follow the action and the story.

This film seems a bit campy and formulaic with Bond chasing after some crazed villain who has every detail planned out and everything he does goes according to plan. Maybe that is how the Bond books are but as a movie it felt rote and I just wasn't entertained. I never felt worried or anxious I just felt like I was watching the formula of a cat and mouse game.
I also couldn't stop drawing parallels to Batman and Joker. Orphaned Bond hid under the family home for two days after his parents died and then rose up a man. Silva is running around with an unnamed crew wreaking havoc with impunity.
The first two Craig films seemed more realistic with Bond making mistakes and learning as he goes. This film seems like a step back where Bond, and especially Silva, are larger than life.

5035345,4,B006X040NY,"The fact is, in the truly big scheme of things, I greatly prefer the original James Bond, by which I mean the character realized in the writings of Ian Fleming. The cinematic Bond has pretty much always been a different kettle of fish and chips -- not necessarily better or worse but just different -- and a kettle I've warmed to or not depending on the actor portraying him and the story line he finds himself in. Though not Bond as Fleming envisioned him exactly, Daniel Craig is the actor Bond I have found most satisfying overall, and he doesn't disappoint in his third outing as the British spy with a license to kill. Gritty and rough-edged, he can glide through an elegant party, fitting the occasion to a tee though his eyes tell you he'd rather be elsewhere. So chalk up a positive point for this film. Of number two importance, even in the books, is the Bond villain. Here I think the film doesn't quite satisfy. Oh, Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva apparently gathered much praise from critics for his performance, and I suppose on further reflection I'd have to agree with him -- his performance is excellent. However, I found the Silva character as drawn by the screenplay to be actually rather ordinary and at times even a bit sloppy and inefficient. So, for me, villainy in this Bond film actually turns out to be somewhat run-of-the-mill, despite the lethal blows that Silva manages to strike against British Intelligence.  Next up are the supporting characters, and here Skyfall provides a wealth of engaging new blood for the franchise. Naomie Harris is excellent in a role that turns out to be more than it seems. Ben Whishaw is a marvel as the new, more youthful Q. And the venerable Ralph Fiennes is just right as Gareth Mallory, whose name holds a clue concerning that character's future role in the series. So now the score is 2-1. On to the stunts and the gadgets and other miscellaneous fireworks. They're adequate, though no great shakes, in my opinion. The opening struggle on top of a speeding train is spectacular if, in its manner, a bit cliched. There's a fair amount of destruction but, again, nothing all that novel; let's call it all a draw to make it 2-1-1. As for the Bond girl, well, there's one in Severine as played by Berenice Marlohe, though her performance is limited in more ways than one. Another draw for me, and we're at 2-1-2. That leaves the general contribution of this film to Bond mythology, and here I give the film a firm win: We get a meaningful and illuminating glimpse of Bond's childhood past, and we see him cry over a deep personal loss. And there we have it: A final tabulation of 3-1-2. In less analytical terms, Skyfall does most things a Bond film should either adequately or in stellar fashion, except provide a truly memorable villain. So it's not perfect, but I still find it much better than okay.",1362268800,,2860,4.618860510805501

5035349,2,B006X040NY,"I just finished watching the on-demand video last night and  was disappointed.  The movie started out typical James Bond - action action action - with James chasing the bad guy to retrieve a hard drive.  Car chase (natch!), motorcycle chase (natch!) and then atop the train James and the bad guy fist fight.  The hard drive is around his neck and James is trying to grab it.  Overhead on a hill Ms. Moneypenny (odd name), the sharpshooter, is getting orders from M to take a shot, even if it means hitting James, which she does.  And down James goes, falling into the waterfall.  There's no other movie hero that has action openings like James Bond.

Of course, our hero is alive, even though he's been shot by the bad guy and by Moneypenny.  How does that happen?  Suspend disbelief.  There is a lot of suspend disbelief throughout this movie and plot holes and it becomes a bit annoying.  there is a lot of conversation in this movie, especially from M (Judi Dench) and that becomes annoying after a while.  The main bad guy, Silva (Barden), and his motive for wanting to kill M, makes no sense.  The Silva character is not menacing, scary or threatening.  He's more MAD than anything else.  Nothing about this movie made sense and it was quite boring at 2-1/2 hours long.

The movie is also repetitive with James landing in water at least three times during the movie.  I've seen that underwater scene too many times in Bond movies.  The cinematography was blinding.

Among the James Bond movies, this one was a dud.  Casino Royale is still the best Daniel Craig/James Bond movie IMO.",1362268800,2,1587,4.616487455197133

The plot was pretty much entirely ripped off of Mission Impossible, which is only one single major example of this exact story being told on the big screen. Seriously what was up with the beginning? It looked like someone took Pink Floyd album artwork and made a 5 minute movie intro out of it... Needless to say there was no lack of bad guys with machine guns that couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. No lack of unnecessarily exposed women. No lack of action scenes. Certainly no lack of James Bond doing what he does which is mostly females (usually!?!?!) and scotch. The movie was ""meh"" at best for me. I watched it because I had to.

5035353,4,B006X040NY,"There was something lacking in the James Bond reincarnation starring Daniel Craig before. It started in Casino Royale when Bond orders his drink. ""Shaken or stirred?"" asked the bartender, and Craig looked at him with stern eyes and replied, ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" While Casino Royale was a great action film and put Craig on the map in a huge way, as a Bond film it didn't measure up.

Fast forward past Quantum of Solace, a disappointment all around involving Bond skirting the border between agent and rogue to fulfill a personal mission with a weak payoff, and we find ourselves at Skyfall, the Bond film that almost wasn't, this is easily the best of Craig's Bond films to date, and the peices fall into place to form a more traditional James Bond moving forward.

After being presumed dead, James Bond returns to MI6 rusty and injured after M (played by the ever-capable Judi Dench) receives a cyber threat and witnesses the MI6 buidling explode. With assistance from Q (finally making his debut in the Craig films, played by Ben Whishaw) and Eve (the lovely Naomie Harris), Bond must track down and apprehend a psychopath with a missing upper jaw who has sworn revenge against M.

At the end of the film, I was clamoring for more. As long as they can stop making terrible video games, I see no end to the Bond franchise, and Mr. Craig has a long future ahead of him if he can keep improving on his performance as Bond.",1362182400,,1433,4.525096525096525

5035383,2,B006X040NY,"To everyone who states this Bond movie, ""Skyfall"", is the best Bond film ever, I ask this question: What are you smoking? Except for the opening scene, everything is wrong with this pathetic movie. Why? Here's why:

1. Do we ever find out what ""Skyfall"" is referring to? I don't think so. Perhaps a metaphor pertaining to the agents dying one-by-one? Unclear.
2. Is there action in this movie? Yes. However, it's so stupid and obviously rehearsed that its not credible (e.g. the scene with Bond attacking the Asian ""gangsters"" with his briefcase then falling into the pit with Komodo dragons/Gila monsters that were obviously computer-generated. Pathetic.
3. This stupid Bond movie seems to have different movies blended into it in a hopeless effort to win and attract audiences (e.g. ""The Dark Knight"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Goldeneye"", etc.), instead of focusing on true film story development (ask any intelligent college/university professor if ""Skyfall"" had a story worth watching and they'll tell you, ""No"").
4. The scene towards the end of this laughable movie involving Bond's orphan house is so lame, there are no words to describe it's stupidity.
5. Unfortunately, ""M"" dies in this movie and so does this Bond movie.

The only worthwhile elements of this movie were:
1. A young version of ""Q"".
2. A different version of ""Moneypenny"".

If you are a true Bond fan, you will agree that ""Skyfall"" is one of the worst, if not THE WORST, Bond movie ever made so far.

Instead of just a fast action pedal to the metal spy flick this one includes more drama and details into the origins of James Bond and the issues within the British Secret Service.  I will not go into the plot and put spoilers into this review.  I will only say that it does include a lot of chase scenes, action, beautiful women and of course the always cool James Bond.

The thing that makes this Bond film different is the in-depth insight into the stress, both physical and mental, that agents like James Bond endure while doing their jobs.  This made the film a great 007 movie along with being a good drama with suspense. I thought this film featured great acting and special effects but I also enjoyed the emotional and personal side of the story.

This film seemed to be the first step of kick starting the 007 movies into a new type of film for the next 50 years.  I started reading Ian Fleming's 007 books 50 years ago and I loved every one of them.  This new transition made by this film will make the series of new films even more interesting and enjoyable.  This was an attempt to refresh the characters and breathe new life into the James Bond saga.  I liked it a lot!",1362096000,,1256,4.306382978723405
5035395,5,B006X040NY,"I have enjoyed the Bond series ever since the first movie came out 50 years ago.
Along the way there have been a few bumps in the road (Moonraker, Quantum of Solace etc.) but all in all many more high notes than lows.
Following Quantum I had been concerned that Daniel Craig may have been a mistake ala Roger Moore, however with Skyfall I find that I am once again eargerly awaiting the next installment in 2 years. To paraphrase Shakespeare I believe the fault with Quantum lied not in its' Star but in itself.
Skyfall has everything that makes and has made Bond great so often for so long.
The story line and plot are top notch, among the best in the series. The underlying motive of revenge proving to be among the strongest and most viable of all. Javiar Bardam as Silva is a great villan.
Only one of the moments in the film didn't quite ring true for me. The London Underground scene with the falling train is a bit of a reach - the perfect timing of the train and it's fall in order to allow Bardams' escape. What if it had been 15 later or Bond had been 15 seconds earlier in the chase? In any event, a minor nit pick.
Also I wasn't a big fan of the casting of the new Q Ben Whishaw. Or perhaps more accurately with the writting of the character. Just a bit too smarmy for my taste. I suppose I am more old school here and lean to Desmond Llewelyn. Again, a minor annoyance and nit picking on my part.
The film is strong, Craig was solid and it was great to get away from the extreme close ups and rapid fire jump cuts that plagued the previous Criag outting. Direction of this film was far superior.
As an owner of all 24 Bond films (Yes, I include Never Say Never Again), I would put Skyfall in my top 7 and expect to watch it several more times in the years to come. Well done Bond.",1362096000,,1793,4.155172413793103

5035408,5,B006X040NY,"In my opinion, James Bond has been missing-in-action since the Pierce Brosnan days. Daniel Craig's James Bond in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was not James Bond. He was a gritty, masculine action hero who shouldered his way through every obstacle, regardless of the fact that he was wearing a $2000 suit. He was a great action hero, one that I enjoyed watching, but he was not James Bond and the the movies in which he starred were not true James Bond films. They were too serious and were missing all the little things that identified a classic Bond film like Goldeneye or Dr. No.

Skyfall is very much a continuation of these films. It is dark and dead-serious and Bond gets shot, beat, and wrecked throughout the movie. But as I watched it, I could not help but feeling that the real James Bond had finally returned. Maybe it was the return of regular Bond charaters Q and Miss Moneypenny who have been absent for the past two films. Maybe it was the overwhelming presence of Javier Bardem's character Silva, a character that will go down as one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. I still can't quite put my finger on the reason why it feels more Bondish. But whatever it is, I am hoping that director Sam Mendes can do it again.

The story is bold and intense, a welcome departure from the relatively weak Quantum of Solace. In tone and style, it is similar to The Dark Knight, and Bardem, who was largly ignored during awards season, is just as interesting and evil as Heath Ledger's Joker. The cinematography also deserves a nod; the film is beautiful to watch. While not my favorite Bond film, Skyfall is a very well-made movie that sends the James Bond franchise back to the forefront of the action scene.",1362009600,,1732,4.565916398713826

5035422,5,B006X040NY,"Bond appears a bit more vulnerable than in previous Daniel Craig versions. Fortunately, the skills he's acquired over the many years of training (and experience) display an image similar to a Navy Seal. While he does survive a rifle shot to the chest, causing him to plunge off a bridge a couple hundred feet into a river below, his new and numerous previous wounds show a battered body with many battle scars. His age and damaged physical condition display a vulnerable side. Though ultimately, this image is reflected only in those around him. The remaining half of this 2.5hr movie, Bond displays his somewhat diminished  athletic skills and even more tenacity to quiet any doubters.
Craig overcomes his wounds in typical James Bond fashion, employing an old-school flare. With few (if any) futuristic secret weapon toys from ""Q"", Bond shows age and battle scars haven't slowed him down. Craig acts out a classic version of James Bond by overcoming over-whelming odds while beating the crap out of the bad guys, yet again.

Daniel Craig is a fine actor but that doesn't make him a good Bond. He lacks the essential duality of character that all of the great Bonds have had, most notably Connery and Brosnan. The computer motif seems like a throw in to keep up with the times. If Putin continues to bring the old KGB vibe back to Russia, maybe we can return to the good old (bad) days of the Cold War and the Evil Empire. The supposed treachery which created the villain rings more than a bit hollow. Take a look at the classic Sandbaggers series to see how ruthless MI-6 directors really are. Finally, we lost Judi Dench as M for this? What a waste. Maybe she wanted out, like Maggie Smith does for Downton Abbey, but if that was the case, at least give her a script worthy of her demise.

5035467,3,B006X040NY,"IN THIS BOND MOVIE, YOU GET WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO LEARN TO EXPECT FROM A BOND MOVIE:A LOT OF ACTION- THAT EDGE OF YOUR SEAT ADRENALINE RUSH. HOWEVER, WITH THE PROMISED THRILLS OF BREAKNECK ACTION, YOU ALSO GET  A PRETTY SIMPLISTIC PLOT AND NO NEED TO REALLY USE YOUR BRAIN WHILE VIEWING.

IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF SOME GREAT ESCAPISM FROM REALITY- THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.

I have seen varied Bond movies with varied men playing Bond over the years.

I do like Craig as Bond even if he is a more rough around the edges, type of Bond. (

Craig does a decent job with the material he is given.  But in truth, like most Bond movies, this is about action.

 Craig just has to show up.

In fact, it often bears out that the movie is only about action, with a flimsy plot surrounding it, just to give the action a basis to happen.

You  simply don't watch a Bond movie if you want something cerebral.

With the progression of Bond movies over the years, it seems there is nothing super sophisticated about spy equipment anymore- it is getting harder to find more interesting or scary bad guys that want to accomplish some evil mission we haven't heard of already-  even the required Bond Girl seemed to be a FAIL in this movie.

 Actually, I can't really say we have a true Bond girl for Skyfall.

Watch it, to see what I mean.

 It seems that 50 yrs of the same Agent doing much of the same things, is starting to show wear.

It is not surprising that even the biggest Bond fans have become kind of unimpressed with any spy gadgetry as opposed to 50 yrs ago where viewers were really *wowed* by such.

Villains used to be freaky, scary, insane, etc and their desire to accomplish something sinister was once chilling, where now, it has kind of left us numb to it all.

Our own world's reality of bad guys across the globe, often ruling nations, tends to make any Bond villain these days seem quite lackluster.

The changing times are definitely reflected in this film not just by what isn't impressive any more, but also by our major use and reliance of the internet.

The villain and the Secret Service are fighting via computers.

The theme of how just about anything can be accomplished by computers is made clear in this movie.

(Watch what damage can be done with just keying in a computer command.)

Some things in the movie proved interesting, while seeming just as unbelievable at the same time.

 But that is the nature of a Bond movie- you suspend all reason and logic the minute the story starts because we all know Bond should have never made it out of the first movie, 50 yrs ago.

To his credit, Bardem takes a different kind of quirky, bad guy and manages to both repulse and intrigue us at the same time.

The  drab, blonde hair he sports, allows Bardem to morph deeper into his very emotionally deranged character.

 Judith Dench. Her main point in this film, is to cover the theme of *loyalty*.

SKYFALL and what it all means, will become clearer as the movie moves into the last 3rd.

We get an important, revelatory glimpse into Bond's personal life of long ago, but I don't want to offer any spoilers so that is all I will say.

Because it is an action packed movie- the storyline goes at a rapid pace.

 In the end, however, I felt a sense of, "" That's it?""

  Yes, that was it and there was a feeling of hoping for something more from this movie that just wasn't there or just never happened.

Can any future Bond movies be kept fresh?  Seeing Skyfall made me question that.",1361923200,,3489,4.360808709175739

5035494,3,B006X040NY,"The story line and pacing of ""Skyfall"" left me uninspired. ""Quantum of Solace"" was better and even that was far below most Bond adventures. The producers have in Craig a fine actor capable of expressing a more believable better rounded hero. Gone are the flippant arrogant lines that were supposed to be comedic and the gadget laden agent. This Bond has to rely on guts and and his own resourcefulness most of the time.

Spoiler Alert: An ex-MI6 agent gets his revenge. While cyber criminals are contemporary, on the whole I kept looking at my watch. The Craig era Bond films  reflect today's world as they should. This project was in trouble from the start since it was due out at least a year earlier. The script was poorly written and the editing of it and the raw film could have saved the film, but it didn't.

If you are a Daniel Craig fan, as I am; you have to watch it whether it measures up or not. One highlight was the re-introduction of Q. This kid seems to fit the Bond of today while respecting the integrity of that character. The action sequences were nearly up to par as well.

Craig's Bond established in ""Casino Royale"" was refreshing and more compelling, resulting in one of the best Bond films to date.
It reminded me in part of ""Licence to Kill"" with Dalten, who unfortunately still had to say those pesky low comedy one-liners left over from the Moore interpretation. Craig's  portrayal brought new life into the character that was sorely needed by the franchise. Vulnerable but incredibly tough plays believably as the familiar character must use all of his energy to save the day. Hopefully the next one will be more on par with ""Casino Royale"".",1361923200,2,1670,4.609427609427609

To the point if it came on TV I wouldn't even bother watching it again. Seemed lacking in plot. They tried to make it deep with the concept of Bond aging and the relationship between him and M, yet with the tackiness of the bad guy, and the bad guy's bad dye job....his hair oh my goodness! Why dye a guys hair that blonde when you can see his facial hair is practically black?? Looked horrific. And then the hilariousness of when Bond gets shot on the train in the beginning, like anyone's upper torso wouldn't be blown to bits with a bullet from that range, or at least have a good chunk missing....and they never did explain how he didn't bleed out or have a major artery or blood vessel severed. You'd have to have someone pull you out of the water immediately, and try to stop the bleeding then medevac them to a hospital by helicopter.....then the holes with the IT technology side of it. Like Q wouldn't know by hooking up the bad guys computer to their network they wouldn't expose themselves to a virus when they are dealing with a guy who hacked their network earlier?? Seriously? Please what is this kindergarten? A far better more realistic movie Id watch over and over again is the new Bourne movie. The Bourne Legacy.",1361923200,2,1390,4.4980237154150196
5035497,5,B006X040NY,"This is one of my favorite Bond movies because it pays homage to its history, incorporates current film trends and style, further develops the character of Bond and has a solid story as its shell.  Yes, there are changes to some familiar characters that add support to the portrayal of Bond by Craig.  The new cast is being set in place for the films to follow.  Javier Bardem is stellar as the crazed and maniacal enemy out for revenge against MI6, specifically Judi Dench.  One cannot go back in time to the older Bonds but one cannot forget what made Bond great.  This film finally does what the previous two Bond films failed to do.

the ""NEW"" Bond, is portrayed in this film as old. I didn't care too much about seeing the original Bond Mobile totally wiped out. OUCH! Let's all hope that Bond will live on. I'm sure he will.

Daniel Craig has all the right stuff to be Bond, and this movie is visually stunning.

If you want to really enjoy this movie, upgrade your sound system. The best picture that doesn't draw you into the action is a loss. There are too many pure action/fantasy movies that lack what skyfall has, class and straightforward entertainment. I recommend it as a high point to the Bond Dynasty.

5035614,3,B006X040NY,"The action scenes were spectacular, as they have been in all the Daniel Craig 007s.  Craig is clearly a Bond for the current times.  He is as good in his way as Sean Connery was in his, and that is saying a lot.

The move to reset key characters was largely a success, with a return to the original concept of M and Miss Moneypenny being better than the trendy, nerdy Q change, on which I reserve judgement.

The retro aspects, reminding us that Bond is about heart, determination, loyalty and duty worked pretty well. Re-introducing the old Aston-Martin and then destroying it was a bit over the top, but OK.  The idea that Bond had an ancestral home and some dark secrets in his youth seems a bit unnecessary.  Bond is not about psychological dilemmas and will lose his charisma if that aspect of modern movie-making is introduced into Craig's physical, willful, ruthless Bond.

The big weaknesses in this movie are the villain and the Bond girl.  These two traditional elements were not handled as well as in past Bond movies.  Javier Bardem is capable of creating a 1st class villain, as the Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men clearly showed.  Here, we must simply accept his prowess.  He does very difficult things off camera, but nothing on camera to make us believe he is Bond's equal.  The Bond girl is too complex, too vulnerable, too multi-cultural and too briefly sketched to care about.  Not even Bond cares about her.

While this movie is all about justifying the end of the old M and seducing us into a reset of the main characters without jarring our feelings about the overall series, it needed a better plot.  Much of what happened in this movie is too unbelievable.  The Bourne series got the feel of the ""evil but necessary"" spy agency right.  As a result, we believe the unbelievable things both the CIA and Bourne do.  Here, MI6 is simply a caricature.  That weakens the believability of the plot and motivates us to think about why characters behave as they do.

All in all, a satisfying segue, but more a prelude than a stand-alone symphony.  The next 007 will need to be very good if momentum is not to be lost.",1361836800,2,2138,4.559055118110236

Actually, Im surprised they decided to use actors at all. I suspect they thought If we just blowup and destroy enough stuff; won't that be good enough?.

Speaking of actors; they wasted some really fine acting talent on this flick.
The ending was a perfect exit from the Bond 007 franchise. This shot to hell used-up old man decides hes going to continue to be an active agent in the field. PEE U!

5035652,3,B006X040NY,"I look at all the four- and five-star reviews for Skyfall and ask myself, 'was I missing something when I went to the bathroom at the movies?' Cause I just didn't see this as a spectacular movie.  This was the first Bond film since ""A View to a Kill"" where I actually found my interest waning.  Now, before you start thinking I'm a Daniel Craig hater, know this...Casino Royale ranks among my favorite Bonds...this movie is no Casino Royale.

First off, the art-house director, Sam Mendez...Eon Studios has been trying to use art-house directors to make a memorable art-house Bond film for years.  There was Michael Apted who directed the memorable though melodramatic 'The World is not Enough'.  And of course Mark Forster's lamentable ""Quantum of Solace"" (which, by the way, I find slightly superior to Skyfall).  Neither measured up to art-house quality.  Enter Sam Mendez...his doesn't look so much like a fish out of water like Forster's QoS, but it doesn't rise above the middle of the Bond pack.  The funny thing is the closest thing to an art-house Bond film was made by someone who is known as a master of the thriller genre, Martin Campbell, with Casino Royale.  This review will harken back to that high-water mark for the series frequently, moving forward.

So where does Skyfall fall down?  Lets start with the second unit (action sequences).  Sure, the opening teaser sequence is thrilling.  The car-chase-foot-race-bike-chase-train-fight-crane-on-a-train-fight was frenetic and breath-taking.  Wonderfully filmed, too.  But it doesn't measure up to the parkour chase in Casino Royale's opener.  Jumping from crane to crane had me on the seat of my pants...much better than jumping from crane to train.  So, ok, great opener.  Then??? The second unit goes to sleep.  There are really no other set pieces worth commenting about, till the end.

Oh, and about that ending...critics have been swooning over it since the film's debut.  I just don't get it.  The bad guy walks around the castle tossing grenades in the windows to smoke Bond out...hohum. Compare that to the epic third reel of Casino Royale...Bond shoots the balloons to make the Venitian villa sink AND shoots all the bad guys AND the turncoat Vesper gets trapped in an elevator under water AND Bond tries but fails to rescue her...this was exquisitely filmed by the second unit and seamlessly constructed by Campbell who basically wrote a new chapter on how to tell a story in an action adventure film with that segment. I strongly recommend viewing the outstanding documentary on how this sequence was filmed.  The most that can be said about the third reel of Sam Mendez's outing was that Javier Bardem's face gets a maniacal glow in the flames of a burning Skyfall castle.  Big deal.

But my biggest criticsm is reserved for the plot, which makes hollowed-out volcanos seem downright plausible.  <<SPOILER ALERT>>  Let me make sure I get this straight...the villain bombs MI6 headquarters to make them relocate to their old digs so that when the villain manufactures his own capture they can bring him to a cell that will just happen to be located next to a subway system that can be highjacked to create a tunnel from which the villain can escape (dressed as a bobbie with a pre-positioned uniform) so he can assassinate M while she's testifying before a subcommittee of Parliament.  Did I get that right? And we paid to see this AND said its the best Bond plot, ever?  I don't think so.

Any other issues? Hmm, lets see...how 'bout the women.  Naomi Harris will make a wonderful Girl-Friday, I hope we see more of her in the future.  But we didn't see much of her in this film, which is a shame.  Berinese Marlowe...sultry looks, shallow part.  So under-utilized.  Before I knew it...she got what one of the good guys always gets about mid way through a Bond film.  I was disappointed in the brevity of the relationship (though the circumstances of her plight are riveting).

Much was made about the return of humor to the Bond franchise in Skyfall.  Really?  I was expecting some serious chuckles but I didn't experience them. ""Its the latest thing from Q branch; its called a radio""? Really? THAT'S the big return to humor? I return again to Casino Royale for comparison, which was a highpoint for humor in the franchise.  Example 1:  Bond, without skipping a beat, pretends to be a valet and parks an obnoxious tourist's Range Rover, smashing into the guard rail setting off all the car alarms while Bond chuckles and tosses the keys over his shoulder. He then uses the frenzy around his actions as a diversion so he can do some serious investigation...humor AND irony!  Loved it.  Example 2: the torture sequence in Casino Royale which had all of us guys squirming in our seats, then cracking up when Bond shouts, ""NO! to the right...to the right!""  THAT was funny.  Skyfall was almost as unfunny as Quantum of Solace...almost.

OK, so I ripped the film.  But it DOES have its merits, the aforementioned teaser sequence being one of them.  Which, of course, seques into Adele's wonderful theme...worthy of the Oscar she just got.  The completion of Dame Judy Dench's story arc for ""M"" is exquisite.  Her reparte with Bond in the DB5 is priceless (OK there was SOME well-timed humor in the film). Its always a good thing to see the DB5, even though I cringed at what became of it.  And I think the film sets up the series' next installment very well.  So all is not lost.  And while I complained mightily throughout this review, the fact remains it is far superior to most action adventure drek out there.  So I would say it is definately worthy of a view...I've already purchased the blue ray.  So EON has gotten to me, nonetheless.",1361750400,,5717,4.79038854805726

Gone was the outrageous stories, unlikely characters and unbelievable weapons and went back to its roots. I can not recommend this movie enough.

I am pleased with the Blu-ray release.

5035698,3,B006X040NY,"Let me start by saying I am a 50 year old guy who has been a Bond fan since I was 8 years old.
My first exposure with Bond was going to see YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE in the theater with my dad in the late 60s
(back then in small towns, they would often play replay movies 2-3 years after original release)

Later in my teens and college years, I collected and read all the original Ian Fleming novels.

Even today, if I have to take a long road trip, I will listen to an audiobook of James Bond read by Simon Vance.

I prefer the more serious Bonds of the early Connery years over the Roger Moore films of the 70s
It is not Roger Moore's fault ...... the 70s was simply a time period in America where post-Vietnam, Hollywood made many movies ""campy"" to try and lift the nation's spirits.

I think George Lazenby did a good job in OHMSS and I like the serious tone they brought back to the series with Timothy Dalton.

I think CASINO ROYALE is possibly the best movie in the series.
Despite physically looking nothing like Ian Fleming's Bond, Daniel Craig is a great actor who portrays a serious gritty Bond very well.

I think it is no coincidence that CASINO ROYALE follows the Ian Fleming novel closer than any other film in the franchise and also happens to be one of the best (or the best) movies in the series.

Quantum of Solace was pretty flat and not inspired.

That brings us to SKYFALL .......

(warning - there might be some minor spoilers below) ...........

I think the success of SKYFALL is largely due to a massive marketing effort timed to coordinate with Bond's 50 years in cinema.

On it's own .... I don't feel it lives up to the excitement and high praise.
It is nowhere close to being as good as CASINO ROYALE.

Point by point ------------

1) You must totally suspend logic with this story.
We have a villain bent on revenge who claims he was ""planning this for years"".
So we must believe that he was able to plan down to the exact second when he would be captured, when they would try to crack his computer code, when he would break free, who would be assigned to chase him, where trains and cars would be at precise times and even where people would be standing months in advance for all his elaborate plans to work as they did on the screen.
B.S.
So it makes him seem omnipotent, but actually it it TOTALLY unrealistic and silly.

2) They made a big deal out of this Bond villain being the most menacing of them all.
No way ........... this main bad guy was a goofy comical character.
Imagine Batman's Joker if he was a total over the top ""flamer"" from a Key West Gay Pride Parade.
This is no Le'Chiffre or Goldfinger
This is a wimpy, weak and totally boring Bond bad guy.
No menace at all.

3) Time Continuity means nothing in this ""parallel universe' of Bond.
This bothered many people I spoke with.
In Casino Royale, they essntially re-booted the series with a young Bond only recently getting his
""OO"" license.
Vesper helped him mold his trademark image of dress and drink and class.

Now only 2 movies later, he is burned out, tired and worn out after ""too many"" years on the job.
He has a crew cut and looks to be 51-53 years old.
However they use this film to introduce ""new"" characters that are part of Bond's full career.
HUH ??
It makes me wonder where they will go with the next film -- or is time totally irrelevant in this new Bond universe.
He is young and new to the job in CASINO ROYALE -------- he is old and almost ready to retire in SKYFALL
I guess we must take each movie to be a stand lone time irrelevant story from now on.

4) Many of the individual scenes are well done and powerful -------- but as a whole, the film has the feeling of 3-4 disjointed scripts forced to work together.
I always say a really good movie makes you forget for a few seconds that it is make believe -- you almost forget you are watching a movie.
But SKYFALL just looks and feels like a cast of actors on site filming a movie and doing their job.
Whatever that ""magic"" ingredient that makes a movie seem like it is real is missing here.

5) BLU-RAY does nothing for this movie.
The DVD and BLU-RAY look virtually identical.
This is probably because 80% of the movie is either shot in...
  a) cloudy rain
  b) dark night time
  c) with heavy blue filters

As techs may know, digital film and photo has a hard time dealing with black balance.
That is why dark movies on DVD and Blu-Ray are often ""grainy""

In order to take advantage of true 1080p HD video quality, you need good lighting

That is why sports events and nature shows in HD are usually used to demonstrate HD TV in stores.
The brightly lit, vivid colors with high saturation really benefit from HD or Blu-Ray quality.

But dimly lit, grey, dark blue or black video will look almost the same in Blu-Ray or DVD since it is too dark to take advantage of the enhanced video resolution.

SUMMARY -

Skyfall is ""OK"".
It was entertaining to sit thru, but it is not a Bond movie I see myself watching very often.
I feel it sold so well due more to mega-marketing and the ""50 Years of Bond"" nostalgia, than it being a super masterpiece.

I feel SKYALL is much better than QUANTUM OF SOLACE -------------- but, I feel it is far weaker than the excellent CASINO ROYALE.",1361664000,2,5239,4.3044806517311605

The film starts with the ""death"" of Bond following a fight with his arch enemy and a fall down a waterfall (sounds familiar?). Once he comes back to life all thoughts of having a storyline are quickly forgotten as the film replays a series of set action sequences which are basically copied from the Die Hard films. Bond is fairly useless in these sequences, so it is just as well that he faces a equally useless opponent. Thousands of bullets fly but magically miss the villain of the film, despite him being targeted at point blank range. The last half hour provides some light relief as it is based on Home Alone, just not as well done. The villain is finally slain due to him somehow forgetting to wear a bullet proof vest, a serious omission if you are going to a shoot out party. How could anyone could think that this is a quality film?

5035730,5,B006X040NY,"Having been an avid cinema buff for 50 years and having seen most of the James Bond movies (excluding most the dreadful Roger Moore era), it's easy to be jaded.  But Skyfall may be not only the best James Bond movie to date (we've all said that before), but one of the best movies of 2012. For those of us who were around when Sean Connery set the standard for the role, we never thought he could be  supplanted.  And for decades, that has been true.  His successors (Lazenby--pilloried at the time but gaining respect for his one outing); to Roger Moore (very disappointing considering how charismatic he was as the Saint); to Timothy Dalton (unappreciated and ahead of his time); to Pierce Brosnan (who was also considered maybe the best Bond to date--but then his movies lapsed into some of the gadgetry silliness and he became stale in the role.

The critics prematurely and unfairly scalded the producers for selecting Daniel Craig--but he has set through his three Bond movies (or re-set) James Bond as a hard edged, imperfect man---probably closer to Ian Fleming's original characterization.

But to the movie itself--technically, the blu ray is perfect.........as to the movie-considering it's length (in excess of two hours), it moves at a breath taking and exciting, no nonsense pace.  Craig is dynamic and hard edged in his role.  And it is interesting how the reboot---which started with Casino Royale---now comes full circle....starting with the reintroduction of ""Q"".  And by the end of the film (the last 10 minutes are riveting) we now see certain other characters reintroduced.  And we see the transition of the role of ""M"".  The blend of today and the ""60's style""---even down to Craig's very British, narrow lapeled, slim suits--is both mind bending and fascinating.

By the fourth Brosnan film, I had dispaired that either these films were just too formulaic to survive (or I was getting too old and jaded). But Daniel Craig has breathed new life into the role.

Here's hoping he will be filming addition James Bond films.  It's difficult to see who could top him.",1361664000,,2084,4.8835227272727275

5035737,3,B006X040NY,"Better than the previous Craig ""Bond"" movies, it had it's moments and it had potential, but it was hurt by some ludicrous plot elements and sequences.

Like all the new Hollywood blockbusters, it was ""action hero"" from top to bottom, and as expected it was entertaining at times and absurd at times. Intelligent suspense and drama has been replaced with said ""action heroes"" and visual shock and awe. Obviously Im in the minority, but I prefer the Patriot Games or ""Ronin"" approach....i.e. very plausible and still gripping.

This being a Bond movie, plausibility is not a consideration, nevertheless, this got farcical on occasion, even for Bond standards.
Skyfall is no smarter than its many Hollywood action movie cousins, but it is visually stronger, so much stronger in fact that it makes the movie seem better than it actually is.

Bond movies are known for their evil and flamboyant villains, and this one applies the same formula, but without success. Nothwithstanding Bardem's fine performance, his character is rather stale. It resembles the villain weve seen in a thousand other movies, Bond or otherwise, and his main action sequences are eye-rolling.

Nonetheless, the ""visuals"" are the strengths of this movie:  1. the introductory sequence (you know, the video collage where Bond walks across the screen and turns suddenly to shoot, and then the images, mostly of women, float up and down the screen while the evocative music plays and the credits run) is enthralling ..... better than the movie.

I Enjoyed the actors as well. Seeing the old Maserati gave me a brief spine tingle. But, honestly, it was the thinness of the story itself and the framing of the Bond character that weakened the overall experience. Nothing ground breaking here, and seeing Bond as a nearly washed up flunky absolutely doesn't cut it for me. Athletes on steriods, Batman drawn down, and now, our hero less world is presented with a defective James Bond(Have you happened to notice how movies these days don't have uplifting or positive themes, but are so often grim and dark instead?). It's sad to have to write a negative review of a 007 movie when I think about the wonderful historical legacy of these movies, but what can I do? Gotta be truthful about what I saw. I won't go on belaboring what may have already said here with regard to Skyfall. I just really hope that whoever is at the controls in movie land does a better job next time whenever that time comes.

Skyfall is so boring and dull, it makes A View to a Kill seem quite lively, the latter being my only other disappointment in the franchise.  Q's gadgets, a radio and a gun that only shoots for Bond.  Give me a break, if Bond lets his weapon get taken from him, he deserves to be shot.  Although the argument could be made that the gun is actually useless for Bond anyway, the former expert marksman now can't hit anything, he'd do better to throw the gun.  The Bond franchise isn't meant to be about a policeman that plods around solving crimes and chasing bad guys.  It's about a superman like being with powerful gadgets at his disposal, pretty girls all around, and shaken not stirred.  It looks like Craig is slated already for the next Bond movie, i suppose the only thing to do now is to boycott the studio, this guy is incredibly awful as Bond.  I do realize the purpose of these movies are to make money, but still, do they need to be so greedy about their profits that they can't put some amount of craft into their production?",1361577600,8,1245,4.331896551724138

5035750,5,B006X040NY,"***Spoiler Warning***

Extremely enjoyable. Hardened, in more ways than one, comes Daniel Craig. A true advancement, using 'Quantum' and 'Casino' as stepping blocks for this 007 of the twenty-first century.

Broccoli's EON again finding the right blend of old school and new school - producing a sharper, tougher, and in an unexpected twist, a more human James Bond. Arguably the deepest and most complex film of the entire franchise; exposing the raw pain that became the soil which bred Britain's greatest field agent.

Absolutely love that the writers continued the concept of orphans making the best operators. For some reason I've always found that idea completely reasonable, despite evidence to the contrary.

Opens as Bond chases down an elite enemy agent - one virtually his equal in every respect. This operative must be stopped at all costs because he's ferrying a stolen NOC List - every covert operative in the world, their alias legends, and true identities. If it reaches the open market, the data will devastate British intelligence and cripple the west's ability to function on the world stage.

As the adrenaline pounding chase explodes out of Istanbul, M orders Bond's second to take a dynamic sniper shot while 007 and the opposition operator battle atop a racing train. It is SIS' last chance at recovering the list. The back-up hesitates, the shot unclear. The chief demands it be taken. Missing the target, Bond is hit instead; his body disappears falling into a massive gorge.

James Bond, Agent 007 is dead.

A posthumous star is carved into the wall of anonymous heroes. Life and the world moves on.

Six months pass.

Despite being one of the most secure buildings on the planet, a massive explosion is set off within the heart of British Intelligence. MI6's Vauxhall headquarters is destroyed, killing many of the senior staff. Whoever this person is or whomever they represent - they know every code, every process, and every access. This isn't a stranger.

Cut to Bond. He's alive and has unofficially retired from - everything. The shot that should have killed him has instead left him breathing, but deeply bitter and scarred. Knowing who gave the shoot order, betrayal isn't something that sits well with our man. Still,  deep within his core, beats the heart of a patriot. After learning of the assault to the service, he chooses a return to the fold. As it becomes clear the attack was against M herself, he realizes that she already has the answer to the identity of their unseen assailant, but rebuffs all attempts at exposing their tormentor. M refuses to believe that, evidence to the contrary in the form of a risen 007, the dead can indeed return.

Marking her final time as Chief of British SIS, the sublime Dame Judi Dench. She'll be missed. Her departure an understandable move by the producers. I get it, they're refreshing the brand. But in my opinion she was the best 'M' of the entire franchise and won't be easily replaced. Even though I think Ralph Fiennes is a superb choice, it will be a difficult transition from this cinephile's perspective.

And speaking of co-stars, thought it was hilarious how the creative team got the sexual tension between the new Moneypenny and JB out of the way. To quote Simon Pegg in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spaced/dp/B0019MFY3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spaced</a>, ""It had to be done."" And I adored Naomi Harris' spunky kickass self. No longer a tame unrequited paper-pusher, Moneypenny is nearly equal to Bond himself - fantastic. And kudos for EON selecting a truly beautiful female. There are too many Thandie Newtons and Salma Hayaks - propped-up outliers and stretched has-beens whose sexuality is based on superficial shock and populist momentum rather than true sensuality. Nice!

As Bond and M confront a specter from the past, no pun intended, sins and unforgiven transgressions are revealed. A twisted cauldron of anger, love, resentment and passion is brewed - spilling its terrible contents onto the Scottish lowlands.

We also own Never Say Never again which is NOT part of the Bond movies, but still a great movie.

We want more! Bring on the next 007 movie! Our whole family can watch this movie and we don't have to worry about viewing things that should not be on T.V. period!

This movie starts off with action! This movie is one of the best movies out right now. There is a good reason the Bond movies have been around for 50 years. Quality, action, pure clean fun and much more! Bond movies always have class!

We love Daniel Craig! Our children are even bond fans and love Daniel Craig! We also have a couple of the sound tracks for some of the Bond movies and yes they are awesome as well! The soundtrack to this movie will be great as well! I even have Bond as my ring tone and alarm!

You will love the beautiful views, action, technology, actors, plot, etc. And some may not like what happens to Bond in this movie, however I think it makes the movie more real and sets it apart.

This Bond shows us what is going on in today's times and what can happen with technology in the wrong hands. This movie is by all means going down in history as one of the best Bonds's ever!

This world is becoming more and more dependent on technology and many reside in a bubble meaning many think they are safe, this movie proves this point to the fullest!

This movie has many twists and turns! This movie has a lot to offer!  With the perfect Villain! The way he eludes Bond is common with today's Villain's.

Skyfall is a blast! This movies transitions the Bond franchise into this modern world. This Bond will have new Bond fans wanting to view the past Bonds.

The whole cast is great and will entertain all who view this awesome movie!

Well time for a fish fry and Bond marathon! Bond always delivers! Keeping movies as they should be! Skyfall is pure class! Thanks for keeping Bond clean, entertaining and fun! We can pass this type of entertainment on to our children.

Ready for Bond 24! Field work at it's best! And no matter how far back in Bond movies you call, they all have class and beautiful decoration, gowns, technology etc.

Flight and many other movies can take lessons from Bond! Good clean movies will last and have a fan base for generations! Thanks Bond! James! James Bond!",1361577600,,2484,4.362255965292841

Losing Q was shocking and sad,but not entirely surprising,since it was time she retired to other projects ( movies) in the future. I was pleased with the pace the movie maintained throughout,since it was a bit longer than the previous Bond movies. The villain was both comical and horrifying and pathetic, yet brilliant and twisted at the same time. Clearly he had a mommy fixation on Q and it was especially evident at the end. They made a refreshing change and did not rely on equipment gimmicks this time and kept it simple and basic for  Bond. I would have done the scene over where Bonds current love interest was killed and had Bond rescue her,instead of letting the Villain kill her and then suddenly Bond springs into action. He could have just as easily have done it then and saved her life! It was interesting getting a hint of what Bonds life was like in childhood. Albert Finney made an excellent caretaker and friend of Bonds.

5035778,1,B006X040NY,"When I was a kid our family went to a wonderful restaurant for Thanksgiving.  They had great food and wonderful service despite the crowded dining room.  We came to expect that.  Then one year, after the restaurant was sold, we discovered to our dismay, that the new owner fired the experienced help replacing them with untrained kids whom he didn't have to pay as much and he went cheap on the quality of food and serving size also.  Needless to say, we never went back.

The movie, Skyfall, reminded me of that experience.  You come to expect a specific genre of movie associated with a franchise as long-lived as this.  I expected gorgeous cinematography in colorful places, characters, both good and evil, that you remember years after the movie premier, each with a unique 'schtick' whether it's Oddjob's hat or Jaws' dental hardware.  Of course you've got to have beautiful women and enough innuendo to know the hero beds them all before moving on to the next one.  The hero exudes suave manliness without expending a lot of effort, not stiff like Mr. Craig.

At least Skyfall got the action scenes down pretty well, the few that merited mention although some, like the fist fight atop the train, seemed to go on and on forever.  But what really disappointed me was the major transformation from the old Bond movies to the latest  ones.  The brooding Daniel Craig, with that childish pout makes you want to slap him upside the head and tell him to be a man.  He isn't helped by his supporting cast, many of whom looked like they did nothing more than punch the time clock and read the lines in the script.  Too many scenes were filmed in the dark which saves money on set costs I suppose.  How I miss the naturally lit Carribbean movie sets of yore.  The scene shot in the gloomy moors of Scotland sums this point up quite well I think.  Even the trademark opening credits were one of the worst efforts I can remember.

However, if I were to point to one single thing above all else that distances Skyfall from the other Bond movies; it is the sound track.  Instead of the trademark crisp, snappy theme music we have come to expect, we are instead subjected to morose, forgettable background sounds...or no music at all; just silence.  I found myself working on a crossword puzzle during such long, drawn out scenes.

If the producer and directors' idea was to remake the James Bond image with more mediocre dialogue sprinkled with a few brief bouts of fast action (to get the younger audience to stop texting), they should change the name of the movie to something more appropriate; like, 'Melvin Pervis: 008"".  To be politically correct, give him an even more effeminant character...""I'll have a fruity frappuchino, my good man, shaken not stirred.""

In summary, I feel this movie is a great disappointment that would not belong in their ""50-years of Bond"" collection.  If they keep it up, the second ""50-years"" collection will only have one or two movies in it.  Like the restaurant owner I mentioned earlier, in the process of trying to expand their audience with fewer bells and whistles and a less manly fare, the current producers are finding that, at least this Bond movie fan, has exited the building. It's not just me, my wife was disappointed also.  Goodbye Bond, hello Pervis...that's Melvin Pervis.",1361577600,9,3317,4.703639514731369

Although I enjoyed the previous two installations in the series, this one has a much better story that kept me riveted to my seat the entire movie.  It does feel a little slow during the first half, but once we meet the villain (played by Javier Bardem) it is a nonstop adventure.  I also love that there isn't a focus on Bond sleeping with women.  I know that is a staple of the films, but it never adds anything to the story or character development.  We see Bond hookup with a woman, but it is quick and we don't see any intimacy.  Also, the new actors introduced help keep the movie feeling fresh and I look forward to seeing them return in the next film.  I was surprised with the loss of a major character, but that is what helped keep the film interesting up to the end.

5035797,2,B006X040NY,"I almost mistaken Craig for a cyborg running around like a video game. Dialog is dry, predictable and looks like no more than going through the motion. There is no suspense, imagination or anything that resembles the Bond of old.",1361491200,,229,4.75
5035798,3,B006X040NY,"The first thing I noticed with this third entry of Daniel Craig into 007's role is that they all have rough, wild, and long chase scenes as their staple, and that while the other Bonds seldom so much as got their clothes dirty, Craig takes a physical beating that no previous Bond has ever endured. And these are getting old rather quickly.

The next thing I noticed is that the new Bond films are extremely light on dialogue in the sense that Craig's Bond character has almost nothing to say, which is probably just as well, because he's hard to understand, as is the heavily British mumbling throughout. But, then, mumbling is not just the problem with these Bond films. Clear, understandable movie dialogue seems to be a thing of the past. Mumbling in English is hard enough to follow. Mumbling in British, is damned near impossible. And trying to watch while reading subtitles drastically takes away from seeing the film.

As for Skyfall, in particular, there really is no plot development; action has taken over. But then Ian Fleming is no longer writing the stories but they appear to be pieced together by hacks.

Despite all this, I gave Skyfall a middling three stars just because it is a Bond movie.",1361491200,,1209,4.693396226415095

5035800,2,B006X040NY,"I went into this hoping for a fresh Bond film.  I got a rehashed and oh not so good version of the Dark Knight.  Hero disappears for 7 years, returns to find all his goodies sold at auction but must still do good.  He has to go after a cyberterrorist and stop him from destroying the internation cyber grid.

When I was but knee high to a grasshopper, James Bond rarely got hurt, he walked out of destructions in an unrumpled tux or suit, to ask for a martini and finds the woman the rest of us women envy.  In this he is (SPOLIER) shot in the first sequence, and disappears into a third world country where he gets hooked on pain killers.  This in not the James bond I know.

I would watch Judi Dench do a round up of Southpark's worst moments.  She (spoiler) was the best M we have ever had until they decide to kill her in the fight with the big bad.  The big bad?  Does he want world domination?  Domination of the media?  All the gold in the world?  Something huge andscary?  Uh, no. (SPOILER)  He wants revenge on M, kinda.

Appararently I am so no a film know it all because I still don't see why everyone squaks that Daniel Craig is the best Bond.  Frankly he lacks the humor and the joy of living that Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan had.  And Roger Moore had more sex appeal.

(SPOILER)  I don't understand why you blow up the entire staff of MI-6 including John Cleese unless you want a complete reboot to fit your strange new interpretation.  I don't get that the only gadgets we see are a (Spoiler) gun that reads Bond's palm print before it can fire and a itty bitty radio, oh and the 60's Astin Martin (spoiler) which they shoot up.  Insert extreme sorrow.  That car was the best thing next to Albert Finney's wonderful performance as the Scottish groundskeeper.

The film also feels like they took a bunch of other films, Dark Knight, Source Code, War Games and put the in a blender to get the plot.

I am as disappointed in this film, almost as much as I was the first time I saw Timothy Dalton as Bond, and we all know how that turned out.  The writers, the directors, the producers and Goddess help us Daniel Craig has to find senses of humor, of lightness and of joy.

Frankly, I am leaving James Bond for the far sexier Jason Bourne and Aaron Cross.  They have picked up the cinematic spy reigns and are runnin wild with them",1361491200,,2346,4.258503401360544

The movie is great. I first saw it in IMAX and now watching the Blu-ray is just as stunning at home. I will not give to much away because a lot of people have not seen this, but the ending was very bittersweet for me, but I guess I could see this coming sooner or later.

5035806,5,B006X040NY,"I was one of many that questioned Craig as the choice for the new James Bond. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every movie I had seen the man in and a few BBC television productions I had seen the man in. He is one of those rare actors that seems to have an innate ability to choose scripts well and a ""loser"" I have never seen the man in.
Well, the first Bond film came out with Craig as 007 and I was blown away. I immediately put Sean Connery into second place as my favorite Agent 007 actor replacing him with Daniel Craig. Besides Craig and Connery, the others were in my opinion dismal failures. What I really liked about Craigs Bond was the steely cruel edge he brought to the role. He also seemed to rid the character of his ""effete"" nature. Craig may still like his Martini shaken not stirred but one has the feeling that he wouldn't be hard pressed to take his Vodka not only neat but directly from the bottle.
The second Bond film was a bit of a let down and way too short. A definite step down from the initial Craig outing and I was worried that perhaps something was up behind the sceens that spelled an end to Daniel Craigs career playing agent 007. I was thrilled when the third installment featuring Craig came out and if any single scene sums up why I enjoy Daniel Craig as James Bond it was toward the beginning of the film, after Bond finally managed to make it inside the train car. Swinging down into the car and in one seamless motion, Craig ""shot his cuffs"" and continued his pursuit of his target.
Yes, this movie does end the great Mrs Dench playing the role of M but all doubts concerning Bond ""losing a step"" were completely laid to rest. He might have been slowed but the cause was injury related and one left the film feeling that no matter what age the secret agent attains, he will maintain his dominant edge by sure force of will if nothing else.
If there was any weakness in the movie it was in the failure to fully flesh out the villian played admirably by Javier Bardiem. I don't know if there was a great deal of his character left on the editors floor or what but a lot more could have been done with the character, especially when the talents of Mr. Bardiem were available.
Nothing about this film made it anything but a rousing success in my opinion. We will always have James Bond and I only hope that we continue to have him played by Mr. Craig for quite some time!",1361491200,,2404,4.251091703056769

Could be the weak plot (the initial scene seemed pretty weak, for example), absence of a ""Bond girl"", very weak Bardem's character. movie is worth watching only for die hard Bond fans. The previous one, even though criticized heavily, was much better, but the best of the Craig's Bond movies is undeniably ""Casino Royale"".",1361491200,,446,4.881578947368421
5035809,3,B006X040NY,"Cinematically Skyfall is one of the better Bond movies.  The action is exciting, Daniel Craig is superb as Bond again, the music is done very well and fits with the scenes perfectly.

The plot though is completely unbelievable.  I realize you have to take some liberties with reality when watching a Bond movie, but this one is way too far out there.  I won't spoil anything, but somehow the villain has everything so perfectly planned out years in advance that he knows exactly when Bond will identify him, where he will be held, what computer system is going to be used to analyze the data, and that M will be in a meeting with the British Parliament on that very day.  Setting up this whole sequence of events leading to Silva's confrontation with M takes the first 2/3 of the movie and ultimately leaves you with a sense of disappointment when you finally realize that every move Bond, M, Silva, Svrine, and Patrice ever made was predestined to happen months or even years in advance.  You just have to shake your head in disbelief.

The last 1/3 of the movie is better and fills in some of the history on the character of James Bond.  The end of the movie itself is quite satisfying.  Fans of old Bond films will immediately recognize the final scene as being very similar to Sean Connery and Bernard Lee's interactions in the first Bond films.  It provides a fulfilling transition from the Casino Royale - Quantum of Solace - Skyfall prequel trilogy to where Bond first was introduced to the world as the dapper British spy 50 years ago.

Overall it was an enjoyable movie even though it won't be worth watching again.  This is not going to be a classic Bond movie, but it does fit in pretty good with the series as a whole.  The 50th year of Bond deserved much better.",1361491200,4,1775,4.509375

Well, neither have I until I saw this 007 Skyfall movie.

 I even hate to use the good name of 007 together with this terrible, terribly directed movie named Skyfall in the same sentence.

 The opening action sequence looked like it was directed by an amateur, including the terrible handling of firearms.

 This movie was so boring that it took the entire movie for them to kill the old, wise coyote.

 Sadly, the axiom of Hear no evil, See no evil, and Say no evil does not apply for this 007 movie. Why?  Because this terrible movie tortured all 3 of those senses and--following the theme of a good 007 movie, which Skyfall is not--it's pay back time!",1361491200,5,706,4.403100775193798

5035849,2,B006X040NY,"The Craig movies have always been their own animal but this most recent film completely demolishes what a Bond movie is. I know, I've seen all of them (even that unofficial Never Say Never Again!!). But that's not to say I'm a crazy, die hard fan. I think the Bond series has always been so-so with a few diamonds in the rough.

There is, however, a basic formula: cool gadgets, cool cars, insane villains, bond girls. This movie ignores this formula, removing the fun parts.

The pacing is slow and the plot is more convoluted than ever, but what really kills me is the lack of gadgets, cars and girls. There's still a crazy villain, and that's the one saving grace.

Skyfall is under the impression that telling a good Bond story involves using gritty realism, which means no silly gadets, but Skyfall ironically ends up being one of the more unbelievable of the Bond films. In lieu of gadgets, the new ""gritty"" Bond opts for makeshift homemade devices in the vein of Home Alone paint cans and buckets of goop.

The audience can suspend their disbelief that a pen could also be a bomb, a car could have oil slick hidden in the trunk, and a modern symbol of virility could still drink martinis in the year 2013.  James Bond is a character that has earned our suspension of disbelief, and it's frustrating to see the latest iteration take the magic away.",1361404800,2,1354,4.555555555555555

I would rank it up there with Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Spy Who Loved Me, Living Daylights, and Casino Royale. That is high praise for a series that is now 50 years old. Craig plays an aging Bond perfectly. Javier Bardem plays a very memorable Bond villain with a real ax to grind against M. We get a glimpse into Bond's past which might be the first time we've seen this in 23 movies. My one concern is that Craig is starting to look a little haggard from age (though no fault of his own) so I really wonder how many more movies he's going to be in. Also I hope that then next Bond film is more traditional in the sense that he gets an assignment and does it as opposed to going rogue or seeing big personal revelations- you can only do that once in a while. Definitely pick up Casino Royale and Skyfall.",1361404800,,903,4.286549707602339

5035854,5,B006X040NY,"After reinvigorating the James Bond franchise for a fifth time with Casino Royale and then inexplicably fouling itself with Quantum Of Solace (including what I think is the first bad theme song for a James Bond movie), the series is back on solid ground with the latest installment. Not only is there an excellent script in place, but also very good actors, well-choreographed action sequences, strong character development and a theme song reminiscent of The Spy Who Loved Me & Licence To Kill (the latter being my personal favourite James Bond film).

Biblically speaking, the action sequences are considerably amped up from the level of all the previous James Bond films (excluding the last two), but the violence isn't graphic. Language is minimal in this installment (it's usually never been that much of a concern with this series), and sensuality is limited to two brief scenes. However, there may be another scene that qualifies as almost erotic, and which I will discuss in my next sentence. The main reason I didn't see this film in theaters is because there's a scene where the villain caresses Bond's chest & legs (and possibly his groin off-screen, where the camera focuses on Bond's face); that may be interpreted as a homoerotic overtone, but I personally thought of it as a form of psychological torture ala The Joker in The Dark Knight. Look at that scene any way you want.

There are some very nice surprises in store for fans of the franchise...

With that in mind it's only fitting that as the silver screen revs up to celebrate 50 years of James Bond and 007 flicks, that MI6 undergo transformation.  It's time for the post-WWII children and the Baby Boomers to grab their hats and coats, put in for their pensions and whatever is left of their 401Ks, and turn the Bond Agency over to the next generation.  Spoiler:  How do scriptwriters force old-timers, who simply don't know when it's time to leave, to depart gracefully?  Along with ""cleaning"" the writers became witty enough to begin preparing Bond fans for what will inevitably be the departure of the current Bond (played by Daniel Craig -- the best 007 since Connery).  Sadly to say viewers are forced to accept the reality that Bond and 007 are not the man, but the office he holds and the duties he is assigned.  With all this in mind, viewers must now start doing some intense soul-searching and ask themselves if the next Bond/007 can be a woman or a man of color.

5035864,5,B006X040NY,"After all the hype about Skyfall I was disappointed in the movie. It is an average James Bond movie, with all the constituent pieces, chase scene(s), women, at least one archaic gadget (in Skyfall's case), and of course a super villain. But Skyfall was sorely lacking - I have seen better everything, over the years from this franchise, starting with my visit to the local movie theatre in 1965, at the ripe age of 15 to watch Goldfinger. I have long been a fan of the series and have no serious argument with the Bonds' chosen over the years. Some, I thought more suitable than others, but all around, they all worked just fine.

The problem with Skyfall is that the promotion of the movie worked out better than the movie itself, including dollars moving from my coffers to theirs. The promoters (critical and actual) get a 5 and the movie gets a 3. The downside is that many critics, who are supposed to be fair (as they are not the real promotors) stated in various tongue, that this is  t h e  must see James Bond. These nere-do-watch critics have forever lost credibility in my eyes.

Roger Ebert who I generally include among the several movie critics I read before making an investment, probably because he's been around as long as I have, and, has been correct more than once, until now, gave SkyFall a 4 out of 4 - on a 2.5, absolute tops, movie! Possibly the medication.

I liked they diversity of the people used in this movie. The theme song is really good. I like that they are actually aging James Bond and not unrealistically keeping him young.

What we're going back to is closer, much closer, to Ian Fleming's original version of Bond - an only child, orphaned, misogynistic, hemmed in psychopath.

5035922,2,B006X040NY,"I don't even know where to begin...this from someone who really enjoyed the first two Craig James Bond films...but this one is a complete farce.

First of all the antagonist (played somewhat admirably by Bardem, despite a TERRIBLE, CLICHE script) is a direct rip-off of both the Dark Knight's Joker and part Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal)...yet his character is introduced so far into the film, for the first time, that his back story is a quick, sweeping narrative about him being some disenchanted former agent, who now spends his entire life trying to ritualistically and publicly kill ""Mom"" or ""M,"" because he felt she left him hang out to dry in the past.

Why does he do this? Apparently because, well, his cyanide capsule didn't work and just left the inner part of his face melted-off, or something like that, so he has to wear some sort of piece to hold-up his cheekbones/jaw and teeth.  He is also apparently gay, and decides not to kill Bond while he can, instead feeling him up a bit, then showing him his (unimpressive) lair, and of course giving Bond the opportunity to escape  (which somehow turns into a long-winded plan to lead him to M, that is so unrealistic and lacking in continuity I can't even get into it here).

Any ways, he has apparently set-up camp on this remote, deserted island town where he can access just about anything imaginable - from Satellites to top secret military codes/radar equipment.  How he does all this? Who knows, he's apparently some sort of hacker too, beyond his agent skills, and seeing that his pals are literally a bunch of slobs with pee shooters, and are disposed of so easily and quickly, it escapes me completely as to how this guy managed to become such a threat, or why he would be so feared by M16 or any other group.

So he attempts to stage these ""Joker-like"" plans to murder ""M"" (the woman behind giving Bond and all the agents their orders) in the most ridiculous, non-sensical, unbelieveable fashion imaginable, I can't even explain how he comes up with this plan that actually, somehow works, despite a million different things that could easily go wrong, only to end-up with him talking too much while holding the gun pointed at her in a no-miss situation, or Bond's, before he's foiled.  It's so cliche it's ridiculous.

When Bond has the chance to kill him? Bond hesitates and gives him plenty of time to...set-off a bomb with his cellphone (that he points out to Bond what it is before doing so at gunpoint) and it happens to explode right above where Bond is standing somewhere in a subway tunnel of some sort in the middle of the city - amazing!

Actually, I can't even go into how bad this film is start to finish, there is no romantic connection in this one, at least there doesn't appear to be, nor nearly enough back story on the antagonist, the stunts are completely ridiculous - as they almost choose to fight on the top of a moving train and duck for tunnels, which again is so insanely cliche and unrealistic, I found myself laughing at how stupid the whole thing was.  Almost everything about it was predictable the entire way through, despite the writers best attempts to not be predictable.  I keep waiting for it to just end...but it dragged on and on.

And oh yeah, Bond DIES in the beginning of the film, but is somehow rescued at the bottom of a HUGE, deep river after the train fight in the middle of nowhere as if it was all planned - really???? They never explain how exactly this happened (a brief scene during the intro song of a woman grabbing him down below in the water as he sank - was she a mermaid?), and he just comes back to life months later. And oh yeah, he was shot twice, fell hundreds of feet from a train bridge, and it was all, well maybe, planned...or not.  Who knows, it was ridiculous.

This movie is for the mindless, a bunch of cliche action scenes and plot lines, directly ripped-off from other films I mentioned, has no consistency or continuity, is not even realistic or believeable, even by Bond movie standards, and is easily the worst of the bunch IMO.

I don't know what everyone is smoking or thinking when it comes to this film, I really don't.  It's awful in every sense of the word, start to finish.  Good cinematography aside, I just don't understand why so many people actually like it!! Why!!??  All of the 4 and 5 star reviews here are simply one-liners (""Best Bond ever!"" ""Great movie!"")

It's a huge black eye on the Bond series, and even some of the poorer ones of the past surpass this hunk of Hollywood action, violence-obsessed garbage.",1361318400,,4572,4.56601466992665

5035926,5,B006X040NY,"50 years. That's half of a century of womanizing, spying, blowing up cars, using the latest gadgets technology can provide, and spouting one-liners. Or, in James Bond's' case, just another day at work. Indeed, 007 turns fifty this year, and what better way to celebrate an incoming mid-life crisis than to deliver unto us the best Bond film in decades? Actually, how about being one of the best films altogether in a long time? I think that is a more appropriate tagline. That, and it has a nicer ring to it. This wasn't the case with Bond's last film, unfortunately. It has been nearly four years since Quantum of Solace, and it left us with the feeling of empty satisfaction and expectations drastically unfulfilled; a vicious bark with no bite, if you will. But where there was a drought that Solace had left behind, Skyfall brings in a tsunami to raise the mark once again. This time, Skyfall is the espionage film we've all wanted to see long after Jason Bourne left the stage...well, the good Jason Bourne, anyway.

The first thing that immediately comes across after a few minutes into the film is that this isn't your dad's Bond. The elements are there; the suit and tie, beautiful women, (mostly) memorable villains; the ingredients remain intact. It's the recipe, the overall theme, that bears a stark contrast to the lightheartedness(?) of the previous films. It is a dark, gritty, grim foreshadowing of Bond's weaknesses, fears, and the series of catastrophic events and decisions woven into a paradigm that spells out one simple, devastating question: Does an evil exist that can dismantle MI6 and eliminate Bond permanently, from the inside? Well, it wouldn't be a film, much less a Bond film, worth watching if there wasn't, especially when it clocks in at 2 hours and 30 minutes.

What is so rare about a film like Skyfall is that it puts so much effort into all the basic aspects of creating an engaging and enjoyable movie, and yet it doesn't give any indication that it's trying to impress its audience; it just does it naturally. Hardly anything feels forced, ham-fisted, or too self-referential, nor does it try to reinvent anything in the filmmaking arena. It simply does what Bond does best: entertain and impress.

In an age where technology is advancing at a blistering pace and trends are constantly shifting, Skyfall manages to keep up with the times while also managing to stay close to what made it unique when Bond first emerged on the scene in 1962. I guess the only thing Bond has to worry about at age 50 is someone poisoning his Metamucil.",1361318400,,2573,4.777528089887641

5035933,4,B006X040NY,"After the abortion that was Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is the only Bond to retain the same actor after a four year long gap, and is the representation of the 50th anniversary of MGM's flagship franchise. Does Skyfall deliver, or does Adele let it crumble? It has a LOT (and I mean a helluva lot) to make up for, and I feel that critics fawned over it a bit too much, probably just ecstatic that it wasn't Quantum of Soulless. I enjoyed some of Skyfall, but overall I felt deflated and occasionally a bit bored. There's more subtext here than usual, but the plot is full of holes and it weighs down the action too much.

After a list of undercover agents is stolen (it is never explained how as the movie jumps in after the story has already started) Bond goes off in pursuit of the culprit and is accidentally gunned down by his colleague during a scrap aboard a train moving over a massive viaduct. M believes him dead and is due to be hauled over the coals for analogue incompetence in a digital age. But Bond knows he lives twice and guesses he'll die another day. He's broken and beaten-down, though he insists he's good enough for another shot at catching the baddie.

And so enters Javier Bardem as Silva, a charismatic ex-agent (it's never made clear if he was a double-oh) who lives for revenge. He IS a great villain and is wonderful to watch, bringing an unusual amount of sadness and empathy to the role. He wants to get back at M for selling him out some years previous, and as Bond does everything in his power to protect her they come across as siblings fighting for mother's attention and approval. It gives the film an emotional heart that Bond doesn't usually have.

I feel that this is undone by such ludicrous development and bad scripting as Silva goes about executing a years-in-development plan that relies on way too much contrivance. Where on Earth does Silva get his endless supply of goons? Does he put an ad in the paper? Wanted: Henchman for revenge plot. Must be willing to dress the part (no uniform provided) and die for me. Meets national minimum wage. You can have a gun if you want.

And, for that matter, where does he get his supplies, equipment, helicopters? For a man living as a ghost he sure is connected. Yes, I know I am pedantically picking apart an action movie plot, but Skyfall promotes itself as more serious and a return to form. The aforementioned complaints feel like leftover elements from the Bronson era, and I do feel like it is high time to fire Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. With this fresh start they should have brought in stronger writers, or perhaps just employ a single writer for consistency.

Brnice Marlohe and Naomi Harris pop in as the Bond girls but neither are really given anything to do, the former having about 10 lines of dialogue. And with the franchise adapting to modern sensibilities it feels a bit corny having Bond jump into bed (or in this case shower) with a girl he met five minutes earlier. He's a bit too detached from them for their presence to have any impact on the plot.

There are many attempts to give this entry a better continuity with previous movies, and while I really like this, it feels a little (just a little) fanboy-ish. Am I the only one who thinks that the Aston Martin (in all of it's lovely gray-ishness) is an ugly-as-sin automobile? Or that the Walther PPK is a wimpy-as-hell gun? I've seen potato guns that look more intimidating. Also, the film explores Bond's roots and history more so then ever before, but the big revelation about M's past that has been teased in the pre-release hype is thoroughly non-existent. Judi Dench does get a lot more to do this time around and really does become the emotional core of the Oedipal fracas between Bond and Silva.

Roger Deakin shoots the entire film in Redcode RAW and it looks L-O-V-E-L-Y. Every scene has its own unique aesthetic and atmospheric production design. Really, really good work there. All done digitally, obviously, and while it's gorgeous for this 50th anniversary adventure, I hope it doesn't become standard practice. 35mm may be the past, but I hope it sticks around for the future.

David Arnold is gone. In his place is Thomas Newman, who unfortunately scores the film with no decent melodies and rarely even uses the Bond theme or even the melody from the title song. How I miss John Barry. There is a fare amount of globe-trotting, including Turkey, China, Macau, and the Scottish highlands. However, too much of this cuts back to mundane London. Stuart Baird (having seemingly abandoned his career as a director) cuts it altogether expertly, but he can't add excitement to scenes that have been written so flatly.

I've always felt that Bond movies are defined by the second unit and stunt co-ordination. With the action reserved for short bursts in Skyfall it allows Sam Mendes a chance to put his own stamp on the film. This is both good and bad. Turning a Bond in a character study is a bold chance to take, but they should have turned up the action more. I like gritty, realistic stunts and choreography, but Bond isn't really the franchise for it. There is a sweet spot in-between invisible cars and fist-fighting and I am not sure that Skyfall has found it.

It's not the darkest or angriest Bond adventure (that honor goes to Licence to Kill), but it sure is most atmospheric and downbeat. Let's hope that next time around they deliver more spectacle and excitement.

When I first saw SKYFALL in a theater a couple of months ago, I wasn't as crazy about it as the critics and all my friends were. But then an interesting thing happened: I got the DVD (to add to my collection of all the Bond films), and watching it a second time was a different experience. Maybe it was the noisy, crowded theater that kept me from really enjoying it, but in the privacy of my home I now see an entirely different film. This is actually one of the better Bonds, maybe the best (so far) from Daniel Craig. And the DVD is gorgeous, with a terrific commentary track from the director, Sam Mendes. If you saw it in a theater and thought you didn't like it, try it again on DVD or Blu-ray. You might change your mind about it. I know I did. Highly recommended.",1361232000,,885,4.062857142857143

So why four instead of five stars......two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a movie I don't care how good it is.

of the Bond Franchise. The new bond seems to be an aging washed up version of James Bond. The Bond women do not hold a candle to those cast in the past. I have seen better ""love"" scenes in soap operas. This Bond, for lack of a better a word, is a sissy.  Gone are the cool gadgets, cars, etc.  Is the next Bond going to be a woman? This looks like where the franchise is going. By the way, I am a woman and this fell flat for me. Sean Connery must be laughing somewhere at this farce. In addition, is Justin Bieber going to be the next Q?

But also:  weak title song, weak opening sequence, way too much Judi Dench (AGAIN), we're taken inside a casino but NO GAMBLING SEQUENCE (I want to see Bond beat the crap out of a bad guy at Chemin de Fer or Poker)...  Back to the Bad Guy:

Javier Bardem was riveting in No Country for Old Men, but he is embarrassingly blah in this effort.

He's been what? waiting for 24 years to get back at M?  Why is this ""list"" compiled in the first place?  Awfully convenient for Silva to come along and scoop up.

WORST VILLAIN'S LAIR EVER!  This ""lair"" could just as well been the blighted landscape of the 1970's South Bronx.  Why did he particularly have to go this this excuse for a lair?  It's just some abandoned buildings and a few laptops.  WORST LAIR EVER!

Bond said Silva's escape must have been years in the planning, but MI-6 just moved to that building a week before.

5035954,3,B006X040NY,"What can one say?  In Bond films, a fist fight will never do if heavy machinery, fast moving vehicles and high powered weapons are available.  Nothing is ever knocked over, it's blown up.  ""Skyfall"" is a bit excessive even by that standard.  Adele sings one of her worst songs at the opening of the main part of the film, and I believe the title is ""The End"", which it is, as it turns out.  But not for Bond---who seems to die a Sherlock Holmes death at the opening fight sequence.  They're not going to kill off the lead character in one of Hollywood's most successful franchises ever.  No, they're cleaning house.  Dame Judy Dench has come to the end of her run, to be replaced by a younger, sexier, darker skinned version.  A new ""Q"" is introduced, a very young, and very geeky version who works quite nicely.  The old Bond car----the Aston---is reintroduced, and then blown to bits.

And, in the steady parade of exotic places where Bond goes to fight people, kill them, and blow things up, they end up in Scotland (not my idea of exotic, but then again, I imagine Shanghai isn't exotic to those who live there) where we find Bond's childhood manor house, where his parents are buried, and they blow that up.  The whole house.  Apparently, there's room for only one Downton Abbey, and not in a Bond film.

Fly off, fight, blow things up, fly off, fight, blow things up.  Ho hum.  Daniel Craig's Putin-esque Bond is aging fast, but he still has a chest made to titillate the women and gay guys, and you see more of him than the women, which can't be good for the franchise.  Still, we live in odd times;  After fighting the nazis for five years, and the communists for thirty---without building a wall along the border, now we're fighting a handful of Arabs that have us so scared we're building that wall, and the Liberal president is proposing using drones to kill American citizens in America....so Daniel Craig's  Bond is the Bond for a world so screwed up we no longer remember what we're fighting for, or who, or why, or what's even going on.  I'm not really comfortable with this dour, rather savage Bond.

Thank heavens for affordable large flat screen tvs, because nowadays we don't have to pay to see this junk in the theater!

Of course the acting is mediocre, but you don't watch Bond for the acting.  The special effects and stunts are wonderful, as always, but can't make up for the lack of imagination in the plot and screenwriting.

In the three Bond movies he's been in, Daniel Craig has been an enjoyable new type of Bond, a good, earthier counterweight to my favorite, Sean Connery, but he needs some help that he's simply not getting.  I've enjoyed the Bond movies since ""Dr. No,"" but unless the current torpor and lack of imagination in the productions are overcome, Bond has truly jumped the shark.",1361232000,3,710,4.656

And then there's...Javier Bardem...what. a. good. villian!  The pairing of Daniel Craig and Javier is perfect.

5035963,3,B006X040NY,"This is a very classy, well done Bond film... a worthy follow-up to Casino Royale. But I think they can make the story (stick with Bond) and action scenes more compelling.

The opening sequence... good but make the action more intense by really keeping us with Bond and make the fight on the train a great fist fight (that happens to be on a moving train). Laziness in action creeps in when they let the set pieces carry the action. Make the motorcycles do more on the Istanbul rooftops, in progressive suspenseful steps, not just race a top them, unless you make the speeds increase so intensely you're waiting for them to fly off, etc.

Adele's song... is just ok, though I like the fact a Bond song is now on the radio. But it comes off amateurish or mediocre when she hits the down notes of ""we will stand ta'ulllllllll..."" Plus I prefer the exhilarating title sequence and song for Casino Royale that sends you off into the movie excitedly.

M... great plot line, but at the end of the day, you really want to see Bond's relationship with women his age, that's more compelling. But I guess we won't have to worry about that fact anymore.

Pacing... there's a long slow stretch in Shanghai and Macau. It's teetering on boring. When Bond is creeping towards the assassin in the Shanghai building, edit. Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, but we can still see it when the sequence is trimmed down. The shaving scene with Moneypenny is really the moment to speed up the pace. I know it's suppose to be seductive, but it's another slow scene after a whole slow paced sequence. Then comes more of the same (but better) in the casino with the conversation with Severine. Their dialogue relies on some overused Bondian dialogue too, but it's so well executed it glazes over that fact.

Villain... Need more with a villain crossing paths and interacting with Bond, learning things about each other and the villain's plan until they collide in the end. When Bardem escapes, his whole plan was to execute M at a government hearing in public display... good, but that could've been bigger and put London in peril somehow with Bond needing to do something more to save everyone.

Skyfall... entering Scotland is a tonal shift and I do get less interested when this part of the film is reached. The climax of never-ending explosions and the destroying of the car were pretty yawn inducing. Again, you need suspenseful progression, directly to Bond doing something, not just wiring a (bomb) and things blowing up. Maybe more on the frozen moors or Bond in the house with Bardem in it, scary or intense... something.

Mendes is a director of plays and he tends to set up his 'big moments' for actor's soliloquies instead compelling sequences that need tofocus on Bond being awesome and taking down scum bags in entertaining ways.

But I cannot, and will not, consider this as an authentic Bond movie!

Why?
- No cool gadgets
- No hot chicks (spoiler alert- okay there was one, but she got killed just a few minutes after a half baked steamy scene.)
- lame storyline - this is quite subjective, but I was expecting a more complex storyline than the straightforward story of an ex-agent obsessed about killing M. (You know, something with more 'meat' on the plot, like Casino Royale. Something I would think about days after watching the movie.)

The Craig Bond films have modernized the storytelling and pacing to fit today's movie audience and the change should broaden the fan base for future films.

It starts out with the usual excitement - this time in the markets and on the rooftops of Instanbul.  Some villain has stolen the names of all MI-6 agents and will soon start slowly revealing their identities which means they will get killed.

I enjoy Craig as James Bond.  He is smart, loyal and has character.  And he comes across as less sexist than Connery. Although loved Connery, too. In this film Bond travels from Instanbul to a remote island, to London to his boyhood home in Scotland which suffers some damage.  The cinematography is inspired in this film with original camera shots and atmospheric lighting.  Javier Bardem plays a convincing villain.  And Bond's new supervisor Q brings the movie up to date as he's a young computer whiz.

I liked the special effects although my son said how could you improve on an ice castle which was in an earlier Bond film.

Daniel Craig delivers his best performance to date as Bond; as does Dame Judi Dench, as M. And this iteration of the James Bond story features the quintessential antagonist (my opinion) of all the Bond films, Raoul Silva, played with superb villainy by Javier Bardem, One of the mainstays of the films, the Bond women also play into the story, beginning with Judi Dench as M, who has a much more prominent role in this film. In addition to Dench, look for Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, the only Bond girl, who has a significant role. On the MI6 lineup, look for Ralph Fiennes as Mallory; Ben Whishaw as Q; and Albert Finney as the grizzled gamekeeper of Bond's ancestral Skyfall Estate in Scotland.

 Director Sam Mendes gets a lot credit here. First of all, the cast is perhaps the best ever in a Bond film. Some of the films have been hurt by poor performances by models who couldn't act, such as Denise Richards. None of that nonsense here, great casting. Javier Bardem was particularly good as the villain. This film doesn't have action every second, which is another plus because it makes it feel real instead of cartoon-ish. If you like the tongue-in-cheek things from the older films you may be disappointed, but all of the Daniel Craig versions have been more realistic. The photography in this film is magnificent, just a brilliant production with beautifully shot scenes. Anyone who appreciates cinematography will love watching this. Cinematographer Roger Deakins is one of the greats. Definitely one of the best Bond films ever and I'm sure many will say the best ever, a remarkable achievement considering how long this film franchise has been around.

Got it on the release date (I cant say enough how much I love amazons shipping) tried to play it in my theatre room - IT DOESNT WORK!!!!!!! Totally disappointed at this point I called amazon and they sent me a replacement immediately (again I cant praise Amazons customer service enough). Received the new copy today and this blue ray doesn't work either!!!!

After the second one I am certain this is not an amazon problem. What's the deal?????? Who is to blame for me having to watch ""Dvd quality"" instead of blue ray. If I find out who is to blame I will never be buying any product from them again and make sure anybody I know doesn't either.

What's the deal? There has to be other people out there that this has happened to. I would like to hear from anybody that has got shafted like I did. There has to be something that can be done! Is this going to happen on other blue ray titles?",1361145600,,1024,4.246153846153846

Personally, I think Daniel Craig is a great Bond and this edition captures the usual action along with just enough tongue in cheek humor to keep the violence and intrigue from overwhelming a sense of fun that Bond films should have.

My wife, not a devoted fan by any stretch of the imagination, enjoyed it enough to want to see it for a second time.  Having seen it for the first time myself, I'm certain I'll watch again.",1361145600,,532,4.520833333333333
5035991,3,B006X040NY,"That's what this outing reminds me of--those brutal Vin Diesel flicks from a decade ago. Or maybe the Rambo franchise of the '80s. A lot of KERBLAM and KABOOM and over-wrought plot. The contrast between hushed dialog and seismic gunfire and explosions that have you using your remote more than Bond uses his trusty PPK, for fear of your neighbor beating on the wall if your TV doesn't have ""smart sound"" automatic level control. My old Magnavox 27"" set that croaked two years ago had it--my new Toshiba 46"" LED flatscreen doesn't. Which has me micromanaging my audio and running down the batteries in my remote on flicks like this. And here I thought technology made ADVANCES.

The teaser scene before the opening titles was so lengthy (almost 15 minutes) that it had me wondering if there was was an error in my copy that dropped me into the secene AFTER the opening titles. Somebody here mentioned Christopher Walken--this film's villain Silva is up his alley. Rather than world-historical power issues like Hugo Drax or Goldfinger, Silva is an ex-agent who has a grudge against M for her leaving him dangling in the breeze on his previous mission. Never mind that expendability is the name of the game in his job--a reality that Bond has always faced in the same profession, over 22 earlier movies. Silva comes across as more of a poor-me whack job than the megalomaniac that Bond villains have usually been. I say ""usually"" because we've seen this before in the ""contemporary"" Bond era, as witness the fellow agent turned villain Alec Trevelyan in ""Goldeneye"", who blamed Bond for letting him be shot and captured by SPECTRE. There is a certain aw-come-on factor in the way this film's ""alternative Monneypenny"" starts out as a field agent who botches a mission and ends up M's receptionist a la her traditional counterpart as we've seen since ""Doctor No"". And unfortunately that's not the only aw-come-on in this film, or even the biggest--anti-spoiler constraints forbid me from telling you any more than that.

As we've seen in earlier Bond films, there's a graphic leading into the closing credits saying Bond will be back, but I'm hoping that the next one will be done with a bit less ""that was then, this is now"" and a bit more ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". Progress that isn't really progress, well...",1361145600,,2317,4.79

5035994,3,B006X040NY,Way too 21st century.  The movie took itself way too seriously.  Those of 50 years ago were always a lot of tongue in cheek.,1361145600,,124,4.125
5035995,2,B006X040NY,"I'm going on a rant with spoilers included!  Yes I'm a James Bond fan from the Sean Connery get-go, who for me will always be the quintessential James Bond; suave, debonair, funny  and yes someone who can roll with the punches. My two favorites being Goldfinger and From Russia With Love. That being said there was once a franchise called James Bond that you could go to and have a pretty good time. Sure it could get campy, but you could always count on the trade mark qualities of - Exotic Locations - Exotic Women - Cool Gadgetry - Funny quips and a Kick Ass Opening.

Fast forward to today's Daniel Craig James Bond recreation. The words that come to mind are drab, brutal and depressing. It's as if the original heart and soul that made this franchise a blast has been ripped out and replaced by a mind numbed killing zombie who's hell bent on bringing us diehard James Bond fans into a fold that is real, depressing and P.C. correct. Hey if that is the case why pay high movie entree fees when you can simply turn on the news and get all that for free. It's as if the producers in league with the writes are striving to destroy what has made the franchise a success over the past fifty years and for what?  To make it real?  Sure you can update it for the times, but don't piss on the spirit that has made the experience worth looking forward too.

Spoiler Alert*** If you plan to see this flick you may not want to know about the plot holes that are holding Skyfall together. Let's start with the beginning when Bond is accidentally shot by his female partner and falls from a train trussle tumbling 100 feet or so to a lake below.  He's assumed dead, but of course shows up months later with no real recollection of what happened or plan of action to deal with what's happening with MI6.  He's out of shape, too old for the job and being considered for replacement.  Watching Craig drag through this movie you'd think he's already dead, replaced by a robot bit actor.

The bad guy belongs more in The Silence Of The Lambs; a freak show with a denture issues whose world quest problem is not with taking over the world, but in taking out M.  The fem fatale could of been a contender, but instead was blown away by a bullet.  She could of been a. A love interest - B. A double agent - C. Someone who we could of cared about if given the chance.  And then there's the prepubescent Q who is  introduced into this series for the first time.  Now you think this kid would be hip, cool and most importantly imaginative.  Yup, and what does he give Bond for his first cool gadget... His PPK coded to Bond's print.  In essence a safety lock that is oh so P.C. correct and oh so boring.  What about a encoded PPK that shots backwards or even explodes. Imagination what a concept.

For those who loved Bond's original Aston Martin DB5 you'll be happy to know its been utterly destroyed, blown up to pieces. Bond gets a little use out of it, but for this classic symbol of the Bond franchise it should of went out in style; not in a whimper, but in a fantastic scene that would of given this fantastic car its due homage. What do they say - Out with the old and in with the... I'll guess we'll just have to wait until Q comes up with something.

Speaking of homage and then there was M.  Yeah okay I can understand updating characters. Whether it's Dame Judi Dench's decision not to carry on or the producers to take her out and replace her with Ralph Fiennes' the point is the scene where she is dispatched does not give credit and homage to a fine actress whose refined and dignified character merits
more than just being wounded and dying in Bond's arms with negligible dialogue and interaction in the final moments with Daniel Craig.  There should of been a kick ass scene with the two of them; fighting the villains that would of highlighted her send off and made it one to remember.

Woulda - Coulda - Shoulda.  I gave this review 2 stars because of the potential of what this could of been and with a glint of hope of what it might be. By the way does anybody miss the electrifying James Bond guitar riff that was once a dominant factor in the early movies?  When you heard that theme you knew you were in the right place.  XXX - The Bourne Idenity and even Stallone's Expendables have brandable qualities that keep bringing the audiences back. Why because they keep the faith with their audience whose expectations are met again and again.  You'd think with 50 years behind them that the 007 franchise would get it right.  If the forces that be don't adhere to the qualities that distinguished this franchise from the very beginning they will find that their 50 Golden Anniversary will be a celebration of its heyday, not its future. Remember what happened to Coke when they messed with the formula. For me there will always be one original. Bond... James Bond.",1361145600,2,4865,4.387527839643653

It's closer in spirit to an Ian Fleming novel. Daniel Craig returns as James Bond. Cyberterrorists are hunting down MI6 agents. 007 has to prevent Silva(Javier Bardem) from assassinating M(Judi Dench). Q and Miss Moneypenny return to the series. The Skyfall theme song sung by Adele is very good. There's a fair amount of fan service. Bond drives his Aston Martin DB5 in the last hour of the film with the Monty Norman/John Barry James Bond theme music on the soundtrack. The music score composed by Thomas Newman is quite good.

5036006,4,B006X040NY,"I loved the movie but this is not about the movie this is about what you get on your blu-ray. First tons of commercials that at least you can skip by hitting next chapter. The ""Comming attractions"" play every time you load this up. They will probably release a special edition that will not have the commercials. I can still look past this. Here is the real problem. Its only 5.1 DTS Master Audio. This sounds excellent but this is blu-ray and I have a 7.1 system. So my side channels are just idle when blu-ray was made for 7.1. This glaring error is the real reason its 4/5 and not 5/5. Now for the special features. This is the best part. There is one labeled ""sneak peak"" so I played it. OH ITS THE COMMERCIALS. Trailers for the new die hard, a commercial telling me what blu-ray is and how great it looks. This is probably the reason people pirate movies. The other extra features were commentary and the trailer. Just basic stuff. I paid $20 for this and as much rage as I have because of all the dumb commercials. I am still happy I bought this Blu-ray and I am so lucky to stare at the 20th Centuray Fox logo for 30 seconds every time I pop this in. I hate them but I still love bond.

5036010,4,B006X040NY,"I loved Casino Royale and thought Daniel Craig was perfect as a very physical James Bond/007, resurrecting new life into the Bond series. I've seen CR many times. I bought Quantum of Solace on Amazon and liked that, but not as well as Casino Royale. I just saw Skyfall this wknd; watched the entire thing riveted of course (good action sequences), but I wouldn't care if I ever saw it again. Normally, if a movie is truly GREAT and timeless, I watch it over and over (examples: Lord of the Rings, Star Trek with Chris Pine, Harry Potter series, Batman Begins/Dark Knight Rises, etc.). Skyfall was interesting, but very personal as 007 is protecting M more than saving the world. The villain reminded me of the Joker from Batman. Daniel Craig looked old, tired and washed up. Not the super sexy, unstoppable super agent that makes Bond movies so addictive. I get that he was supposed to look old and we were supposed to doubt if he was field-ready, but...I didn't really like that. And didn't like Eve either; she wasn't a compelling female sidekick that runs with Bond throughout the film. The good thing is I didn't know who the bad guy was until halfway-through, so liked the twists & turns & misdirection. I do miss the tech gadgets and hope in the next 007 that Bond is back to being ultimately physically fit, rough & tumble awesome, not an alcoholic, pill-popper with blood shot eyes who can't hit a target.

It is a complete FARCE & in no way REPRESENTS the TRUE & REAL ""M"", ""Money Penny"" and most importantly the TRUE James Bond characters.

I'd be pretty pissed had I paid $30 for movie tickets and been presented with this uninspiring, I don't know, saga, which drives no other point than insisting on the penchant for doing things the old way. A thoroughly failed attempt at presenting substance in a franchise that is mostly about shallow, pretty things. Speaking of which; there are no notable special effects, no gorgeous girls, no gadgets - basically none of the things that would generally help my mind ignore egregious plot holes. There's a whole lot of M though.

As a sidenote, Mr Mendes, if you're going to hang a shotgun on a wall, please don't do so three minutes before the shotgun fires. Some of us in the audience do keep track.

The picture quality of this film is wonderful, crisp, and colorful, while the audio is sharp with no apparent issues.

And I must say, so does every other actor.  I DO resent Moneypenny being a black person.  She has always been white.  Just like Agent Felix Lighter was first played by David Hedison, THEN a black man, and finally another black man in Casino Royale.  I believe they should STAY the race they are first introduced.  White stays white, black stays black, Chinese stays Chinese, Russian stays Russian, etc., etc.  It is too confusing the other way.  And STUPID.  Warps the integrity of the movie.  Also, I do NOT appreciate recording artists placing 4 or 5 Previews on a NEW DISC.  I WANT ONLY THE MOVIE.  Not the Advertising.  If I want a movie, I'll buy it.  I resent this crap being placed on new OR old  movies.  It is bad enough with costs as they are.  Recorders and re-recorders should wake up.  The public does NOT appreciate this!  But this IS a true 007 movie with a Twist at the end that was SO COMPLETELY SURPRISING.  I don't know whether to be devastated or await the future.  Guess I will see what is next.

After rebooting my computer to close all connections, I am then told that the updated Flash for Firefox still will not work... so I boot up Win Xp in virtual box only to have the '1 stream at a time' message again...  After one more reboot and loading Vbox, I got it to stream and then almost wished that I hadn't.

This is a damaged, unshaven Bond who is struggling to keep up his indestructible and arrogant image. It's suggested to Bond, ""Why not stay dead?""

5036081,5,B006X040NY,"Spoiler Alert:  You may wish to  postpone reading this review until after you have seen this movie!

This is a defining moment for Bond and the crucible of all 007 films. At one level, while strictly speaking, not a meta film, it clearly questions the effectiveness of 007 against today's sophisticated computer hackers and terrorists . At another level, it asks its viewers, in a not-so subtle way, if the 007 franchise still has a future.

This movie redefines Bond and MI6, and in the process, it presents a Bond who is tired, unshaven,  who drinks by himself, who runs out of bullets and who fails to get the bad guy. It also presents a Bond who throws away his PPK when we runs out of bullets ( this cliche is usually reserved for the bad guys in the bad movies).  Bond has hit rock bottom and fails the MI6's physical and psychological tests before he can be reassigned to the field (M assigned him anyway).

Bond's metamorphosis started with a bang in Casino Royale and a thud was heard in Quantum of Solace.  The suave, debonair, charming and ultimate womanizer is put on hold. In addition, the gadgets, humor and dream cars are, at least temporarily, a thing of the past.

In the opening scene the mission to retrieve a ""list"" with information compromising British agents is botched. M orders agent Eve to take a shot at the bad guy. She misses and hits Bond.  Bonds disappears to an island where he heals his wound, sleeps with a girl, does not shave, drinks heavily, sometimes with a scorpion on his hand. This scene, does not advance the story, but it sets the mood, and  therefore is necessary. This is rock bottom. Bond, M and MI6 have failed.

This time Bond's arch enemy is Raoul Silva, ne Tiago Rodriguez ( Javier Bardem).  Silva is an ex-MI6 agent who was betrayed by M in exchange for English prisoners(?) held by the Chinese. Mr. Silva wants revenge by blowing up MI6 and  killing M. That translates as going to war with Bond.  Silva's character is brilliantly portrayed, and so far, unique. He works alone--although he seems to have some sort of network-- and has the knowledge and the resources (after all, he used to be one of them) to hack into MI6's computers and eventually blows up MI6 headquarters with apparent ease.  Mr. Silva is out for revenge and everyone is vulnerable.

Gone are the considerable wealth, private armies, missiles, underwater cities, private islands and limitless technological resources of Bond's former arch enemies. Silva is ugly inside and out. When is captured briefly by MI6, he removes his dentures: his face was deformed by hydrogen cyanide when he tried to commit suicide..  Silva is a very effective villain and presents a really challenge, even to Bond's male role.  In a scene while Bond is immobilized, Mr. Silva explores and caresses B's chest. The ultimate heterosexual man is the victim in a gay scene. And to add insult to injury,  Silva's seduction of Bond is topped of with an offer to come to the dark side!

The incomparable M (Judi Dench) is on her way out--she has messed up several times.  Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) suggests she retires with dignity and he is to replace her, but not before Bond and M regroup for the last time to eliminate the demented Silva. The scene when they decide to go after Silva takes us to memory lane with Bond driving M in his Austen Martin. It was fun to see M, under attack by Silva AND Parliament to bring the much needed comic relief.  M dares Bond to eject her from the AM's passenger's seat.

In a key scene, we see Clair Dower, MP (Helen McRoy) grilling M about the effectiveness of MI6. And just when M starts making a strong case for the agency's reason for being( without the MP's anger, but with great dignity), Mr. Silva crashes the hearing and makes an attempt on her life. Yes, this film is driven by a personal grudge, but it is clear that MI6 is still needed to protect the citizens of a free society.

In another key scene, reminiscent of the older 007 films, Bond visits an upscale casino in Macao. There he meets the beautiful & mysterious Severine ( Berenice Malohe). We find out that she was part of the sex trade, Bond, who is about to be killed by her(?) bodyguards gets into a fight and ends in a komodo dragon pit. Again, he is working with another field agent. Eve (Naomi Harris) who saves his life. In older Bond films, Severine would have been at least one of the Bond girls.  Yes, he spends the night with her and soon Silva will kill her.

Bond fans will be disappointed in Ben Wishaw's second outing as Q (Quartermaster). In past films.  Q's straight face( and envy?) was the perfect foil for Bond's jeu d'esprit. Here Q comes across as nothing more than a boring computer nerd with unruly hair. Gone is the dynamic banter we came to expect over the years between these two. But in this new spy business, it is after all, according to Bond, ""a young man's game"".

In the final battle with Silva, Bond and M under siege. They are sitting ducks outgunned, and outnumbered.  In the process, Bond's ancestral home in Scotland ( Skyfall) and his Aston Martin are destroyed.  M dies as the result of her wound, and Bond kills Mr. Silva, unceremoniously, in the estate's chapel.

 In conclusion, This film is back to the quality of Casino Royale, Daniel Graig's, first outing as Bond and it is highly recommended. The one between these two, Quantum of Solace, was a waste of time. In this film we find that Bond is from Scotland, that he was an orphan and that his mother was French(?). Bond is portrayed more human, some one who makes mistakes and who drinks heavily.

Out of the ashes a new Bond and new MI6 begin to take shape, his resurrection.  In the last scene, we are properly introduced to the Eve, who turns out to be the new Moneypenny: not everyone is made for field work and she is reassigned to office work.

What's not cool: Broccoli & friends' comments do not add anything revealing or entertaining to the film. (optional).  What is: Bond is the last of the two rats standing.  Bond will be back.",1361059200,,6045,4.5424354243542435

Bond disappears after he's shot and only God knows where he went or why. He's a frikkin British secret agent for crying out loud!! He's not gonna lay around in a shack with a ho for months while his last big job was shot all too hell!

There were these really 'handy' tracks bolted to the loader's arm so he could just walk right across to the train. He throws his gun away after running out of ammo!

He can't hit the broad side of a barn from 20 paces (even before he was shot) and come on, Q was a total pile of nerd crap! The computer use was something straight outta a hokey War Games clone!

In his characters obsession with wanting to kill ""M"" (Judi Dench) he simply goes to ridiculous lengths - with pre-arranged elaborate escape routes for any impossible contingency .  Surely there must be more interesting ways to introduce Ralph Fiennes into the franchise.

5036088,1,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig portrays Bond as a depressed loser. Bond is now Batman and Silva was the Joker. This movie was full of plot holes - Bond gets shot, falls hundreds of feet off the top of a moving boxcar  into a raging river, gets swept hundreds of feet down a waterfall, and is shown sinking, unconscious, 50 ft.below the surface...and we next see him in bed with a Turkish woman, sipping a Heineken....That's enough for me...",1361059200,12,422,4.552631578947368
5036089,5,B006X040NY,"It is ""considered the greatest internal security breach in modern British history,"" and it happened on M's watch. Three months ago MI6 had a secret computer drive stolen, data that lists the identity of almost all of NATO's operatives embedded in terrorist groups across the globe. Today, as undercover MI6 agents persist in turning up dead, it may be that M dedicates some moments to mourning the passing of one particular agent, 007. Except it's hard to think of her indulging in useless sentimentality. In any case, her plate is full as she copes with the fallout of the missing hard drive. The Home Office is strongly suggesting that she retire.

But all that is later on. SKYFALL opens with a thunderous extended action sequence set in Istanbul, as 007 and a fellow agent (Naomie Harris as ""Eve"") strive mightily to recover that same computer drive. The assumption is that this is yet another of the franchise's trademark breakneck opening sequences, complete with bells and whistles. But, in a shocking turn, 007 fails a mission and plunges to his death. Since this happens 15 or 20 minutes into the film, no one in the theater buys it. And so, on MI6's darkest hour, as a hidden adversary attacks the very heart of the British Secret Service, Commander Bond at last reports for duty. M's acerbic response: ""Where the hell have you been?""

I don't know that SKYFALL is the best Bond movie ever. I do know that it's really, really, really good. Coinciding with the film franchise's fiftieth anniversary, this movie is full-blooded escapism. It is invigorating and surprisingly sentimental. Daniel Craig continues his fantastic stripped-down interpretation, playing Bond as an intense, laconic man of action. This Bond very much recalls the toughness of Connery. Except Craig allows us to see the internal demons that have always plagued 007.

In this back to basics James Bond era - for example, Q arms 007 only with a tiny tracking device and a Walther PPK equipped with a palm-print reader - the villains and the sexy women must not have gotten the memo. Javier Bardem plays the bizarre and theatrical cyberterrorist, ""Raoul Silva,"" whose off-kilter mannerisms mask a damaged pscyhe. French actress Brnice Marlohe is the film's token femme fatale. I don't know that Naomie Harris draws more screen time than Marlohe. Probably I was struck with her character's potential. I'm pretty sure this isn't the last we'd seen of the intrepid Eve.

There's fantastic depth to SKYFALL. It lends itself to an intensely personal tone. It opens up a smidge of 007's backstory. Did you know that the film title refers to the name of Bond's family home? But more than anything, the heart of the film is the relationship between M and Bond. Their many-layered interplay, composed of polite spy talk and suppressed emotions, achieves a dramatic weight and an emotional complexity. ""We can't keep working in the shadows. There are no more shadows,"" Ralph Fiennes's vaguely smarmy official informs M, but that bit of reproach may as well apply to Bond. M and Bond are both regarded as dinosaurs, obsolete and irrelevant in today's cutting edge world of cyber espionage. One of the most absorbing elements in the film is that Bond is presented as antiquated, as past his prime and behind the times. Three months back from the dead, he's still recovering from his injuries. His right arm occasionally fails him. To me, this makes for an even more exciting Bond. SKYFALL demonstrates a respect for the Bond legacy but doesn't hesitate to reinvent itself. Throw in a surprise or two, a dusting off of several franchise staples, the exotic locales, the vigorous action sequences, and a terrific theme song by Adele, and maybe, just maybe, SKYFALL is the best James Bond film after all. At least, it's in the conversation. Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are so wicked good.

5036106,4,B006X040NY,"Sometimes newer is not better. Sometimes 'growning & evolving' is nothing but mutating for mutation sake.  Remember when the Superbowl was only about FOOTBALL? Now its about the Superbowl commercials with Football as the 'hook' to keep you watching. Its the same with 'BOND GIRLS'. Once upon a time, 'BOND GIRLS' were only eye candy to the plot (on a par with Q's MI4's 'gagets').  With the last Pierce Brosnan outting, the Bond girl was the movie!!! Quick, name the Bond Movie which almost sank the series? EASY!!! That was the DUO (NO LIE!!!) of James Bond (MI6) and CIA agent (yeah, right) Halle Berry!!! Halle Berry was so wrong for the movie and they made it worse by giving her HALF the screen time!!! Worse, was the most miserable dreck of a Bond score ever to be featured in a BOND MOVIE---Madonna's Trip-Hop jungle beat.  It was the most wretched Bond film I have ever seen and I was around when Dr. No was released in 1962!!!

Everything worked in this film. The soundtrack with Adel was straight Neo-Shirly Bassie---all retro silky jazz!!!  Second, the pacing was good and the story absorbing. Third, the selected Bond Girl was a long legged Eurasian villianess---the scenes she were posed in were absolutely ravenous. WIthout giving away the plot (I hate people doing it), pay special attention to the final three minutes of the film.  No, its not a plot twist or anything special---but it is significant...it was like this film itself, a deliberate attempt to return to the intent of the old James Bond---the old Scene Connery of the 60s.

Why do people adore/identify with JAMES BOND (of the 60s). First, he's good at what he does (completing missions). Second, he is cold and detached and 100% focused. When you are in a crisis situation, you got to remind COOL, CALM & Collected. Remember that family whose accellorator stuck and the car was going 130mph around curves. Everyone was Screaming for Jesus to help them when all they had to do was T-U-R-N off the ignition!!! They all died because they paniced). Third, he's a killing machine---he's strangle you and then go out for ice cream, no big (License to Kill like Seal Team 06 had with Osama Bin Laden). Fourth, he's an adrenelan junky---he gets off being in the middle of things (DeathWish thing). Fifth, he is totally expendable. Yes, he drives F40 Ferraris and gambles $1 million at Baccrat but he has no friends, no family and no possessions---he's like a ninja. You know he won't be fishing in retirement.  Two days after he's walked out, he'll go home to his apartment & shoot himself.  We LIVE through James Bond. We envy his toys, his women playmates, his coolness and his professionalism. He's Macho in a world where the concept of honour, duty country and things male are simply viewed as 'an inside joke'.  Dr. No, To Russia w/ Love, Goldfinger, You only live Twice, Diamonds are forever, The Pierce Brosnan one where the women are smashing Lenin statutes in a grave yard and this one are the only Bond Keepers (Rodger Moore films were too campy to watch).  My only complaint is that they RECYCLED THE ENTIRE PLOT (remember the Pierse Brosnan one with the Chetchen Agent---that one!!!).  I don't care, I liked 'the remake' a lot!!! I know I'm buying my Blu Ray copy!!!  I'm just saying, you needed to see this at the IMAX with a fine Bourbon or Scotch in your hand prior to the curtin going up.

5036110,3,B006X040NY,"Spoilers ahead

If you shut off your brain (including your memory of previous Bond movies) for 2hrs 23min, you'll enjoy this.  Otherwise, this is what will bother you:

1) Unexplained, unfinished plot points:
  a) During the first twenty minutes or so of the movie, Bond is shot and falls way down into a body of water. He is unconscious. We never see him saved, but somehow, after the song and credits, he's on a beach with a woman.  How did he survive? We never find out.

  b) He comes back to England because someone has stolen a computerized list of undercover agents and plans to reveal five names each week, thereby putting the nation's security at risk (not to mention those agents).  About halfway through the movie, though, the main conflict involves M and her life being in danger from a madman. What happened to plotline about the list? That is never brought up again or explained.  I guess we're to assume that the death of the bad guy did away with all that, but that's a pretty big assumption.

2) A Bond girl who dies within a few minutes of her initial appearance in the movie. What's the point?

3) A less debonair, less suave Bond---Craig plays the character as too flawed. I know that the script writers are only going with the times (where we seem to relish flawed heroes), but one of the best things about the Bond character is the larger-than-life persona.  He is capable, above all. Craig's Bond is losing his ability to shoot, doesn't pass the ""spy"" test, and M gets killed on his watch.

4)Overly sentimental -- Can we please get back to a basic spy story (i.e., Bond gets a mission from M, goes on said mission, encounters eccentric villain & gorgeous women, saves England/the world from the bad guys)?  Why must Craig's Bond movies always delve into his past?  How typical of this ""it's-all-about-me"" generation.  Stop the navel-gazing already!

5) Timeline is off --I appreciate the nod to past Bond movies with the Aston Martin, but how can that be regarded in the movie as a relic from the past when, according to the movie, Moneypenny has just become the new M's assistant?

6) I'm still scratching my head over the scene in which Bond meets the villain. What was the purpose of the villain trying to come onto Bond? Was it to make Bond nervous? And why would Bond reply as he does? That was just stupid.",1360972800,3,2336,4.556354916067146
5036111,4,B006X040NY,"For a film that happens to be the 23rd installment in a movie franchise, the latest James Bond thriller, Skyfall, is surprisingly original. Though it marks the series' 50th anniversary by paying homage to many of the previous movies, Daniel Craig's third outing as 007 is unlike any Bond movie we've seen before.

The surprises start early. At the end of an opening action sequence that may be the most elaborate ever (it's actually three or four action sequences rolled into one), we are hit with an unexpected twist that puts Her Majesty's top secret agent out of action. While he's sidelined, a terrorist begins targeting MI6 and its covert agents. Bond must struggle to get back in the game so he can set out to uncover who's behind the plot.

What follows is a movie that turns the Bond formula inside-out. While there is an element of globetrotting, and exotic locales are definitely featured, much of the movie actually takes place in the U.K. That's just one of the ways this Bond movie zigs where most others have zagged. And, without giving too much away, the movie's finale is set-up as an almost mirror image of all those we've seen before.

This is also a film that takes place in the real world. Buildings still blow up (it is a Bond movie after all). But when they do, we quickly see Wolf Blitzer reporting the explosion on CNN as breaking news. In this version of the Bond Universe, when things go wrong, M is called to testify before a committee hearing.

The more plausible setting fits with Craig's take on the classic character. In his first two Bond films, he presented the secret agent as a real flesh and blood human being. You can believe this guy really exists. This time out, he takes that characterization even further. Not only do we get to see him made weakened and addled by the physical rigors of his job, but we also dig deeper into his back-story than ever before. If Casino Royale began a reboot of the series, then Skyfall completes the Bond ""origin story"". In this movie, we learn more about who Bond is and how he came to be the man he is today, than we did in all the previous 50 years of 007 flicks.

Of course, most Bond movies are only as good as their villain, and Javier Bardem's Silva may not be simply the best Bond villain ever, he may rank pretty high on the all-time movie bad guy list, too. Bardem simply outdoes himself as an evil mastermind bent not on world domination, but rather, revenge. With Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes as a guide, the scenes between Craig and Bardem are engrossing to watch. It gives us something else we haven't really seen before in a Bond movie: two great actors going head-to-head.

There are also Bond girls, naturally. Naomi Harris livens things up as a spunky field agent. And the gorgeous Berenice Marlohe plays the obligatory woman-with-a-tragic-past. But the real female lead this time is Judi Dench's M. She is in many ways front and center in a story that deals with loyalty, principles and the moral ambiguities of national defense in the terrorist age. In a non-romantic way, she is also Bond's true love interest this time around.

Skyfall looks back on the first 50 years of Bond, then shows him to us again in a new light and sets him up nicely for his next 50 years. As they always say in the closing credits, ""James Bond Will Return"".",1360972800,,3341,4.558333333333334

I have been disappointed in David Craig and the tact the Bond movies have taken since the producer Broccoli died. I figured the only thing left for them to do to completely ruin the Bond saga was to have him walk off into the sunset with some guy.

Well that didn't happen. Although the plot may have been more at home in a Batman movie it was nevertheless; entertaining and when they trotted out the Aston Martin DB5 and cranked up the old theme song, if I had been in a theater, I would have stood up and cheered.

Ok, it's not the 50s anymore. Too bad. All you kids missed a cool decade. I guess I'm going to have to have more than one Bond.

5036126,1,B006X040NY,"Spoiler alert!  I will be alluding to plot points in the film, not directly but in a general way.

I thought Quantum of Solace was a dreadful, cheap-looking snoozefest and had fully intended to skip this latest effort, but changed my mind because of the wonderful opening credit soundtrack by Adele, which evoked fond nostalgia for the 50 years of Bond cinematic tradition, and because the trailers gave me hope that the franchise was returning to the old-fashioned Bond movie formula of the suave secret agent with the beautiful women and the interesting gadgets (provided by the long-absent Q).  Alas, the trailers lied, teasing us with the appearance of Q only to have the actual Q scene in the film be maybe 2 minutes, tops, and blatantly rub it in the audience's face that there would be no gadgets to come.  The women also did not appeal to me in the least.  This film turned out to be another run-of-the-mill scruffy brute-force Bond film in which, for those of you who didn't realize it, Bond had 2 missions during the course of the film and completely failed at both.  We see him struggle mightily for 2 hours to accomplish something that, in the end, he utterly fails to achieve, rendering the previous 2 hours of viewing utterly pointless.  Honestly, I don't understand what the positive reviewers see in this film; this is not a Bond film, it is a sham that is trading on the Bond reputation while having none of the trademark Bond qualities that I so enjoyed in the historical Bond films.  The qualities that made Bond, Bond.  Maybe the Bond in this movie is closer the Bond in Ian Fleming's books, I don't know, but this is not the Bond that I spend my $12 to see.  I also can't imagine what they spent their budget on, because I don't see much expense on screen.  For me, this will be the last time I will be suckered into watching another Daniel Craig ""Bond"" film.  Sadly, as far as I am concerned, the Bond franchise died with ""Die Another Day"".  It's time to accept that and move on.  I just wish I could unsee that entire Daniel Craig series of Bond films.  Eight hours of my life I wish I could get back.

The opening credits were good, though.",1360972800,17,2164,4.4961636828644505

5036128,5,B006X040NY,"'Skyfall' beside the luscious music was one of my favorite Bond films. Daniel Craig has had to prove himself Bond worthy, and, now there is no reason not to hand him the mantle.

The film opens with Bond engaged in one dangerous locale after another. This is the start of something big right away. And,almost 20 mins in we are supposed to believe that Bond is taken out, no I don't think so. The decision to shoot Bond was made by M, played by the brillant Dame Judi Dench. She had no real choice, Bond was being used as a human shield, a split decision made by M. She was called on the carpet by Mallory,  played by Ralph Fiennes, her new boss in MI6. She was writing Bond's obituary as she was herself was learning hers. Though M is not ready to retire, and,this film is hers as much as it is Bond's. M is a figure to revere and to love.

Javier Bardem, plays Silva, a bleached blonde computer wizard, and as he put Bond through his paces, I was reminded of the early days of 007, and how much he has become a part of our culture. Not just the Bond women, but the old timers like Judi Dench and those who have come and gone. We end up in Kincade's Scottish mansion. Albert Finney another oldie but goodie has things to say and places to go. And, the beautiful Aston Martin makes a reappearance.  Not ready to say goid-bye, not at all.

5036133,3,B006X040NY,"The Bond franchise is still alive and kicking, every bit as intriguing today as it was when I was 4 years old. 50 years and a lot of remakes later, the Daniel Craig 007 is far better, far more credible than any, except for Sean Connery. This motion picture was well-planned to evoke sentiments from those who have followed the franchise, indeed, grown up with the franchise, over all these many years. Oddly, I have never been a fan of the franchise. I have been aware of its existence. I have seen its ebbs and its flows. Like many, I lost any interest I might have had when Connery left the franchise. Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton  and Pierce Brosnan were as about as nancy as they come, in my view. These Bonds were totally unrealistic and stood as forewarning to the coming metrosexualization of modern man. In a word, they were all too prissy.

The franchise has remained fairly true to itself: a one man army defeats the bad guys single-handedly, But SKYFALL is an enigma. How is it that he reaches BACK into the past to produce the Aston-Martin, yet is just now meeting Moneypenny? I imagine that, like Brosnan and Moore, we are to overlook these quirks.

I watched it more for the nostalgia and lure of neatly edited trailers that properly concealed the somewhat lackluster storyline, acting and action.  It took two days to watch. I just had better things to do. That it has survived 50 years is worth noting. I dare say that unless they let go of the bubble in which this franchise has managed to cling to life, they will not see another 50.

People WANT to like this movie based on it being a bond movie, this being a 50th anniversary and a few other nostalgic moments
(related to M, Bond's childhood past etc).  After the Dark knight dark movies are the new rave as well but once you see through all that you will then notice one of the most horribly written scripts in recent times.

Its not even a question of taste its simple about ordinary passable IQ common sense and whats worse the story is about ""intelligence"" operatives.  Consider just a few of the incredible moronic moments of this film -

SOME SPOILERS AHEAD

When a certain villian escapes it is known where he is going.  The people at the location the villian is heading to are informed before he boards a train to get there. high ranking government officials are present so security should be in great supply. The villian takes quite awhile getting there too.  Yet inexplicably they are all surprised by his coming a good many minutes later and he walks right though the front doors with little to no resistance.  Apparently in Bond's World local police are never informed by radio or cannot stop a few armed guys in direct view.

want more?

A woman sets up a romantic meeting on a boat for a time that SHE KNOWS the boat  will cast off into open waters with the next stop being the one man who will obviously not be amused by her affair and has killed people for less. Worse His henchman run the boat and Theres not the slightest attempt at hiding the romantic meeting either. Suicide by open affair was her wish?

one more for the road?

A couple escapes to a building from killers  who would now think they are dead but instead of laying low in the dark for protection they light candles in building which is on an open field and in clear sight of where the killers are  and worse one of them is a senior ""intelligence"" officer not some idiot amateur. Of course the killers see the light.

I could go on for at least three or four more perfectly stupid things that either make no sense in the real world or make no sense for the character (one moment the villian wants to kill everyone at a distance with machine gun fire and the next has to do things up close even at great risk to himself -and within minutes of each other).

Bond always has had suspension of belief in action, romance and slick gadgets but this goes way beyond that for no reason of entertainment (the premise is that the villian and Bond are the top two spies going head to head but  you don't get the sense the villian can even fight and they have no fight scene to speak of).  Its all just stupid writing. When you then couple this with the whole movie being driven by basically ""My adopted Mommy done me wrong"" character it was probably the worse Bond movie ever made.

To all the rave reviewers on amazon and elsewhere.  BE HONEST.  Take away the Bond characters and place this story in another action/suspense film and it would not muster a 3 star rating by most.  Shucks without the Bond name this movie would have lost money at the box office.  Its the power of the whole James Bond franchise that creates these over the top good reviews nothing in the story itself.",1360886400,5,3339,4.355411954765751

Adeles flats and majors and minors she cant seem to continually sing on key. She gets lucky and then the luck dies. This is the first time ever I fast forward through the opening credits. First of all the stunts were not all that great. even the bad guy wasn't that hard to kill or catch. No cool gadgets, or abundant hot women, or even a good plot. Havier Bardem seriously???? Bond is suppose to be the most interesting man in the world. He is suppose to go into a nuclear explosion and emerge only to dust off his tux and the hot girl on his arm or she is the bad guy and he kills her. His gadgets a palm print walther and a transmitter the size of a lighter. Thats it and the bads guys weapon his big bad death weapon a laptop. He is a super hacker. Thats it. The story line is basically Batman Begins right down to the destruction of the family manor. The bad guys in these movies are suppose to be horrifying. They want world order, they want to control the media, they want a new world, or they just want the human race to start over. They are terrifying and can get to anyone who stands in their way. the stunts are suppose to make your jaw drop. There are better stunts in the Bourne films. the women not bad but nothing memorable say for instance Halle Berry emerging from the waters in Cuba in that amazing swimsuit. Or Famke in blue leather and jodphurs and boots in Golden Eye. there wasn't even a cool car or cool cars show cased. Seriously the 1960's Aston Martin??? which they destroyed. There was not a cool Q some young kid no John Cleese, no smoldering hot tenson between bond and Money Penny. No they decided to kill them all off and M dies.. Seriously Judy Dench doesnt get to retire as an M? wow... Oh and the bit part Albert Finney did. He needed to be in the movie alot more. He was the most interesting man in the world.
This seems to be the new bond pattern. Casino Royale was the only really good Daniel Craig bond film. The best well lets just hire Jason Bourne.

SPOILERS:

After being shot by his partner on an assignment, Bond (Daniel Craig)plumnets from a speeding train into a river. Believed to be dead, MI6 finds their last, best hope to prevent information exposing agents embedded in terrorist organizations worldwide almost as dead in the water as Bond.

Bond stays out of the public eye enjoying ""death"" but returns to offer his services to a very surprised M (Judi Dench)when MI6 is blown apart by Silva (Javier Bardem)a terrorist determined to take revenge against M and the agency at all costs.

Bond unexpectantly finds that he has far more in common with Silva than he ever thought.

END OF SPOILERS:

When it was announced that dramatic director Sam Mendes was going to tackle the latest Bond film, there was a mixture of surprise and trepidation as he had never tackled an action film before. Mendes' experience as a director of stage and screen came in handy allowing him to develop a Bond film with more dramatic depth and heft than might have occurred otherwise.

Many Bond films rise or fall (Skyfall)based on the set pieces in the film i.e., the action sequences embelished with plenty of stunts. ""Skyfall"" opens with an exceptionally good one that measures up to the stunning opening for ""Casino Royale"". Bond films also rise and fall based on how complex and interesting the villian is in the piece. Bardem does a good job creating a fascinating bad guy whose grip on his sanity is slippery at best. Bardem makes Silva much more interesting than your standard Bond villian and, perhaps, almost as colorful as Goldfinger or Blofeld. Now that EON productions and United Artists/MGM/Sony own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Say-Never-Again-Blu-ray-Version/dp/B00APD6O16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Say Never Again (Blu-ray Version)</a>&nbsp;and the rights to Blofeld, maybe we'll see that character reintroduced in the next installment.

The script by Joshua Logan with Neal Puris & Robert Wade effortlessly incorporates elements of older Bond films (in a nice tip of the hat in one scene to<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goldfinger-50th-Anniversary-Repackage-Blu-ray/dp/B008YKV1T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goldfinger (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray</a>]), as well as, introducing new variations on old characters.

Featuring (for the first time) some of the best known actors of British stage and screen, ""Skyfall"" sets a new standard for Bond films measuring up to the best reboot to feature Craig&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-Blu-ray-DVD/dp/B009A87ZQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale (Blu-ray + DVD)</a>&nbsp;and expanding to incorporate popular touches from previous films.

The Blu-ray looks terrific with a strong, detailed presentation. The audio is equally impressive with an immersive mix.

The special features are another thing entirely. While the commentary track by director Mendes is terrific (noting tributes to other films and directors) and the one featuring producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli provides nice detail as well, the featurettes (which can be viewed as a single documentary if you choose)are a bit on the superifical side particularly when compared to the terrific ones for the classic Bond films. Still, they aren't bad--they do cover interesting material just not in depth by comparison to what we've seen in the past.

We also get a standard DVD included with the Blu-ray as well as the option to watch the film via Ultra Violet.

Bond's latest adventure returns luster to the series as the so-so reception for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace-Blu-ray/dp/B001PPLIFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray</a>].

5036145,5,B006X040NY,"I would not really call myself a Bond aficionado.  I have seen all three of the movies Daniel Craig has starred in, and a few of the others.  Like any Bond movie this one has a lot of action.  Of the three recent movies, I think this one has the best opening sequence.  Javier Bardem as Siva was definitely the best villain in the recent films.  He plays cunning, creepy and sadistic all at the same time.  Like all Bond movies you pretty much have to suspend your disbelief and accept that he is going to be indestructible.  I won't spoil the opening for those who have not seen the movie, but the chances of anyone surviving what Bond does, and as well as he does is slim to none.

Overall I think the movie has a great blend of action, suspense and even comedic moments.  If you are a fan of the Bond franchise, or just like action movies, this is definitely entertaining.  It is a little long (checking in at just under 2.5 hrs), but I did not ever have a point when I was wondering when it was going to end.

5036147,5,B006X040NY,"Is this the best Bond ever, as some in the media have proclaimed? IMO, no. Is it even in top 5? Close. I'd put Casino Royale (the Daniel Craig version), Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, and From Russia With Love ahead of it. It's debatable whether Skyfall, Live & Let Die, For Your Eyes Only, Dr. No or Goldeneye should be next. Yup, for me it's that hard to decide. Each of those movies are terrific Bond movies, for different reasons. Regardless, Skyfall is one of the better Bond movies.

Reading through the reviews, a lot of the 1-star and 2-star reviews seem to be focused on the lack of gadgets. Its rare to see someone argue that they think a Bond movie needs more gadgets! If you need gadgets, you should be happy with nearly all of the Brosnan Bond movies (esp Die Another Day) or Moonraker. If you note on my top Bond list only one of the movies I listed would qualify as having lots of ""gadgets"". I prefer my Bond to be more of a MacGyver, someone who uses the tools at hand rather than a deus ex machina solely geared toward helping him out of whatever trap he's in. In fact, several Bond movies (For Your Eyes Only, Goldeneye, Casino Royale) were purposely made in a way to get away from the gadgets that can otherwise dominate the show. I also prefer (generally) the Bond movies that are a little more 'down to earth' and don't have crazed megalomaniacs out to destroy the world (The Spy Who Loved Me being the lone exception). And while other low-starred reviewers decry the lack of action I prefer a breather every once in a while, not to mention a little plot development. If I wanted non-stop action I'd recommend sticking with Michael Bay films. No thanks!

Instead, what do we have here? A Bond who has to make choices with consequences. He can't always save both England and the girl. As M and others have noted, Bond's women don't have a particularly good survival rate (5 out of 8 have died in the last 3 movies, by my count). And Bond isn't a superhero; he gets beat up & shot. Sure he wins the day but his body has taken some punishment. A villain who's not a maniac out to destroy the world or make a fortune but who has a very personal vendetta against MI6 and especially M with a well conceived plan to carry it out. Javier Bardem's a weird fellow, no doubt, but he does a good job as the villain. Some information on Bond's origins, which have always been a bit nebulous. I thoroughly enjoyed it and happily give it 5 stars.",1360886400,,2455,4.34640522875817
5036148,5,B006X040NY,"After the last movie, 'Quantam of Solace,' the Bond movies needed to rebound.  Thankfully, 'Skyfall' lives up to the James Bond name and reputation.

The action pieces are great.  The opening sequence sets the stage for a really fast paced movie.  Unlike a lot of the other Bond movies, this movie develops the character a bit more, showing Bond when he is down, injured, and vulnerable.  'Skyfall' also shows how deeply the relationship between M and Bond is and the links that both of them will go to protect and defend each other.

As with all great Bond movies, the villain is super important.  Javier Bardem has developed quite a niche as the creepy villain in 'Skyfall' and 'No Country For Old Men.'  I don't know what goes on in that guy's head, but he is a fantastic villain.

Not to give away any spoilers, but this Bond is a bit more emotional than some of the earlier movies.  In my mind, this is a fitting sequel to the first Daniel Craig Bond movie and one that really holds up to the expectation of what a James Bond movie should be.",1360886400,,1047,4.43455497382199

5036151,4,B006X040NY,"I have always been a fan of the James Bond franchise.  To me, the movies represent a celebration of the very best in Western classical culture.  In other words, Bond is the antidote to Hip-Hop.  Bond speaks the language properly and dresses impeccably.  You can count on a Bond movie to take you to exotic places around the globe.  Ofcourse, James always travels in style.  Preferably in an Aston-Martin.  And his drink of choice is a true classic.  He wears his hair short.  He speaks English like he came from an upper-class, private boarding school.  And you will definitely not see this guy wearing an earring.  And so, in this latest installment, Bond stays true to the same formula.

The plot of this one strays slightly from the typical Bond story.  Instead of trying to save the world from some genius madman, this time, James is attempting to protect M.  During her many years as the head of MI6, M undoubtedly has stepped on many toes, hurt a lot of people, and sacrificed the lives of many agents to get the job done.  As a matter of fact, the movie opens up with her deciding to sacrifice the life of two of her subordinates.  Including Bond's.  A former agent whom she had exchanged to the enemy, in return for a peaceful transition of the colonies to China has come back to kill M.

To make matters worse, this former agent has stolen a list of secret operatives' names stationed in dangerous areas around the planet and blew their covers.  Agents and operatives start dying one by one.  The Prime Minister thinks it may be time to dissolve M's department, as an obsolete relic that is no longer needed.  As befits her high position, M is given the option to retire and a promise of recognition for her years of service to the government.  Bond returns to service, out-of-shape and slightly rusty.  His mission is to recover the list, and find the person responsible.

This is the most character-driven story out of all of the Bond films.  Typically, Bond movies have been plot-driven.  Here, Bond and M reveal more about their pasts than in any previous installment in the series.  Daniel Craig probably gave his best performance to date.  And this time, Judi Dench was given the chance to really show her acting skills.  Unlike the few scenes and even fewer minutes that M normally gets, her character got a lot of screen time here.  Javier Bardem is perhaps just as good a villain as Le Chiffre.  He played the part of a slightly-insane, revenge-driven former agent to perfection.  Albert Finney, Naomie Harris, and Ralph Fiennes round out the cast.",1360886400,,2566,4.645879732739421

I figured for the same price, I'd buy the Blu-Ray (which is High Definition) since they now include a 'Digital Copy', which essentially is the movie for your iTunes library.
So if I'm paying for the high definition movie, why would they give me a standard definition iTunes copy? I would have been better off spending $4 LESS and buying it directly in iTunes, where the quality would have been true 1080p HD. This digital copy is hardly 720p (closer to 480p).

Skyfall is everything I love and expect in a Bond film: great action sequences, witty dialogue, exotic locations, and an engrossing story for a template. This continues the tradition of grittier films set in motion by Casino Royale and once again Daniel Craig doesn't disappoint, giving a great performance, as does everyone else. There were a few twists and surprises that I didn't see coming and the ending was very satisfying, especially as a lifelong 007 fan.

I am leaving this feedback mainly to help others who want to know about the digital format. I contacted Amazon before ordering the disc and was told that I should contact MGM Studios. Really? Contact MGM studios, what kind of answer is that? But I'm ranting now, back on topic, I have purchased a couple Blu-rays and DVDs from Amazon and have been disappointed a few times when the ""Digital Copy"" turned out to be a UltraViolet (UV) format instead of an iTunes version. I know I can access the UV format from the cloud and watch on multiple devices but it has always been significantly more cumbersome. The format for this film is an additional disc that you insert (with iTunes already open) and then enter a code and download. It also comes with instructions on how to download the UV version if that is your preference.

 I found Amazon's customer support to be poor this time around, and will probably look elsewhere for my digital media if they continue to be so secretive in regards to the format of the digital copy. The digital copy was actually supported by Fox Media production, not MGM!",1360800000,2,1322,4.5

It's a perfect callback to previous Bond films through nostalgic canon references, but also stabilizing and establishing the future of the franchise through brilliant storytelling.

The cinematography is absolutely stunning and it's a beautiful film. Hopefully Roger Deakins finally wins his long deserved Oscar for this great movie.

This has some retarded Ultraviolet digital copy redemption which requires the creation of 3 different accounts to redeem your code. Then, you have to pick a streaming video service that nobody uses in order to watch your movie, and then it is available to stream only. You can forget about being able to download a copy to load on your iPad, so you can watch it on a plane or what have you. I recommend this product to those who want to watch a well made, highly entertaining movie on either Blu-ray or DVD. The digital copy is so useless, they shouldn't even be allowed to advertise it on the box.

5036173,5,B006X040NY,"The Blu-ray of 'Skyfall' has about one-hour of special feature short-documentaries that you can choose to watch individually or together. It also has two commentaries: one by Director Sam Mendes, the other by Producers Michael G Wilson & Barbara Broccoli (along with the production designer). The documentaries are interesting, but its clear they've held back on what could have been included as special features to make part of a future release of a ""Deluxe Double-O"" Special Edition.

The DVD has no special features, and is just the movie with an iTunes (off the disc) and Ultraviolet digial copy (off the internet).

As a movie, it is amazing, and certainly the best Bond movie in over a decade. Daniel is not my favorite actor to play Bond, and in his first two movies his performance was not ""Bondian"" enough (but neither were the movies, as a whole). Even Daniel recognized this, as he's acknolwedged in interviews for Skyfall, that he wanted to incorporate more humor and recognizable elements of the formula back into the franchise. In his previous films, just wearing a tux and saying ""Bond, James Bond"" were insufficient in convincing me the action movie i was watching was truly a Bond action movie. Daniel spent his first two outings looking miserable and pissed at everyone; now he is actually enjoying the part, even smiling. I don't think it was so-much that it's taken him three movies to become comfortable in the role, as instead the first two movies were written this way, making the character perpetually angry.

The smartest decision Skyfall made was in being proud that James Bond is ""old fashioned"". There is not only a place for him in present day, but a need. The film has scene-after-scene where Bond's relevence in today's world is questioned. The argument made by the film, especially in it's final 90 minutes, is 'just because something is old, doesn't mean its outlived its usefulness.'",1360800000,2,1917,4.928792569659443

You will get action galore.  You will get amusing character interactions.  The new Q is wonderful, arrogant, and very useful.  You can sense that this guy is going to take the Bond films into some more modern approaches and create realistically useful gadgetry.  M is harsh yet bursting with hidden emotion as always.  You will get a series of death-defying scenarios that leave you wondering how Bond will get out of them.  Interestingly, you also get to see a side of Bond you never have before: the aging operative pushed by higher-ups to doubt himself and pushed by circumstances to worry that his injuries and age may get him killed.

5036179,5,B006X040NY,". . . now should contain Skyfall. This is the best Bond film in years (it may be THE best Bond film, I'd have to think on that a while). Some of the longer reviews here will give you some reasons why you should at least give this one a try or a buy. Typically, Bond films are chock full of gizmos and other deus ex machina do-dads that they seem almost cartoonish.

Not so this Bond -- Q (a new Q, BTW) offers Bond nothing more than a pistol and the spy-equivalent of On*Star to be used if he gets into distress. The rest of the film, although full of action, seems to actually have more than superficial depth, exploring somewhat the issues that come with age -- although Bond does get off a good line when he says something to the effect: ""Youth does not gaurantee innovation!""

If you loved many of the previous Bond's with their many impossible toys, you may not care for this one since it goes light on made-up technology to bail Bond out.  Further, more time is spent in conveying meaning rather than simply displaying how far special effects have progressed (but there are special effects that should satisfy most.)

5036195,5,B006X040NY,"I usually don't review products I have not bought. My wife bought the DVD 007 Bond movie Skyfall. We just got done viewing it.

The color and sound on the DVD was great, no problems there. I won't ruin the movie for you, just give little tidbits of interest.

The rugged, more thuggish, more ruthless, less games playing, older looking and not as pumped up Daniel Craig (my second best favorite Bond,after the original S.C.) acts great in this movie. However the one who INMO did an even better acting job was ""M"" (Judy Dench). She did a shady bad deal to another agent years ago and that comes back to haunt her big time. Silva (Javier Bardem ) plays a good waco villain/ex agent) in this movie. INMO, this was the best role of ""M"" in any of the Bond 007 movies.

Typical lots of action. Daniel Craig gets severely injured and is written off as dead, accidently killed by field agent Eve (Naomie Harris). He comes back to help after MI6 is attacked, members killed and ""M""s life is threatened by a madman ex ""betrayed"" agent.

Scenery was great and we see some of Bond's ancestry and former home in Scotland....Skyfall. Also brought back was the old machine guns, ejector seat Astro Martin. Shades of Goldfinger. Great!

I was impressed that there was very little weirdo improbable futuristic devices. Even the new, nerdy young  ""Q"" doesn't pull out too many weird inventions for Bond. There was Bond's gun electronically imprinted so only he can fire it. Cool. This INMO was a more believable Bond movie. Less clowning around and more of the darker side of ""M"" and the love/hate relationship Bond has with his boss.

A very good, enjoyable 007 movie with ""M"" Judy Dench playing a great role. A great ending I won't ruin. INMO probably around 6 or 7 out of 23 as the best Bond 007 movie.  4 3/4 stars.

Again this movie was more about ""M"" and her past and her shady deal she did to an ex agent. Both ""M"" Judi Dench and Bond 007 Daniel Craig meshed well in this movie and their characters drew strength from each other. Not the typical Bond/M interaction.",1360713600,2,2055,4.502688172043011

5036197,2,B006X040NY,"The three best things: 1) outstanding photography and graphics 2) excellent music and use thereof 3) lots of the previous two. After that, it goes downhill fast.

Is there an insanely brilliant archvillain hatching an ingenious complex plot, like Auric Goldfinger noodling out how to control the world's wealth without moving a bar of gold or sinister madman Hugo Drax who strategized how to take purification of the entire race to the ultimate level? Not even close. Instead, you have a Richard Simmons type who's still petulant about an old performance review.

And what about the trademark Bond girl? Do we have a clever and powerful Octopussy to challenge the man in Turnbull & Asser threads? Or a lethal Fiona who was equally adept with a pocket automatic or a rocket launched from her motorcycle? No such luck. The selection here is the villain's docile hand puppet and the Bond colleague who resembles a counter girl at Starbucks.

Surely, in this day and age they're leaps and bounds beyond the jets concealed in horse trailers, sports cars that convert into submersibles and other machinery that make for innovative chase scenes. Be prepared to fight back the yawn reflex.  There's a motorcycle chase through crowded streets. Have we seen this six or seven or maybe a hundred times? I do give points for the part that careens over rooftops. Then, there's the fight on the train that inevitably leads them to the roof and, brace yourself, having to flatten out when they approach tunnels. What is this, ""Roy Rogers?""

I half expected redemption on this at the showdown. Bond decides to lure his nemesis to his remote and deserted childhood home. He stops along the way to pick up his creaky old Aston Martin to fend off the private army of a guy who employs state-of-the-art weaponry, but doesn't even pick up so much as a rifle. And that makes sense to everyone, right?

The villain shows up with his troops, an array of automatic weapons and ordnance and an attack helicopter. The door is wide open to bring in the new technogeek Q. Take the eggbeater down with drones piloted by your Xbox. But no, that would make sense.

Instead, Bond affixes and lights a fuse to a couple household propane tanks, with the ensuing explosion not only reaching high into the sky and smiting the copter but wiping out the entire estate. You don't have to watch ""Mythbusters"" to understand that's about as likely as taking out an Abrams tank with a pack of Mentos and jug of Diet Coke.

If you relish over two hours of scintillating eye candy and sound, go for it. But, if your expectations run to innovation, intricate plots, intelligent dialogue and other stimulants to your grey matter, keep moving.",1360713600,6,2694,4.766094420600858

5036204,5,B006X040NY,"I'm sure you've heard the old chestnut about cockroaches and Cher surviving the Apocalypse? As the James Bond movie franchise celebrates its 50th year with the release of ""Skyfall"", you might as well add ""007"" to that short list of indestructible life forms. It might surprise you to learn that not only is the franchise still very much alive and well, but that I would rank ""Skyfall"" amongst the very best in the series. Helmed with great intelligence and verve by American Beauty director Sam Mendes, this tough, spare and relatively gadget-free Bond caper harkens back to the gritty, straightforward approach of ""From Russia with Love"" (the best of the early films). Interestingly, the film's narrative owes more to Howard Hawks than it does to Ian Fleming; I gleaned a healthy infusion of ""Rio Bravo"" in Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan's screenplay.

In this outing, Bond (Daniel Craig) has gone into self-imposed exile and crawled inside of a bottle (not unlike Dean Martin's drunken and dispirited lawman in Hawks' film) after uncharacteristically blowing a mission and suffering a near-death experience. However, when a diabolical cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem) with a very personal grudge against M (Dame Judi Dench) begins wreaking havoc directly on the MI6 HQ, the presumed-dead and barely fit for duty 007 reluctantly comes out of hiding to offer his help. Still, M doesn't exactly greet the prodigal son with open arms; he must first prove that he can get his mojo back (the subtext of rebirth serves as a device for rebooting the mythology of a couple significant franchise characters, including a passing of the torch).

Craig has finally settled comfortably into the character; his Bond feels a little more ""lived in"" than in the previous two installments, where I felt he was a little stiff and unsure about where he should be at times. Most notably, I was glad to see one element return to 007's personality: a mordant sense of humor. Bardem is a great Bond villain; his characterization mixes the cool intelligence and creepy charm of Hannibal Lecter with the nihilism and disconcerting cruelty of The Joker (topped off with a blonde fright wig). Ralph Fiennes is in fine form as a government overseer, and it's always a treat to have the great Albert Finney on board. Naiome Harris is excellent as a fellow MI6 agent. This is one of the most beautifully photographed Bond films in recent memory, thanks to DP Roger Deakins (one particularly memorable fight scene, staged in a darkened high rise suite and silhouetted against the backdrop of Shanghai's neon nightscape, approaches high art). I think the Bond geeks will be pleased; and anyone up for pure popcorn escapism will not be disappointed. Any way you look at it, this is a terrific entertainment.",1360713600,2,2782,4.980645161290322

5036206,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is a great Bond.  In Skyfall he looks worn out and tired.  He is wounded, out of shape, and living in a lush paradise somewhere, drunk and pretending to be dead.  He looks used up and he is.  But one morning, while at the bar, he sees something on the news that catches his attention.  He gets up and goes home.  Because he was ""dead"" he is forced to go through a series of physical and mental tests, to prove his readiness to take on the bad guys.  And the movie takes off from there.  He failed all of the tests, of course, but he doesn't know that until much later.  There are some great action scenes and the relationship between 007 and M has never been better.  There are a couple of slow parts, now and then, but the villain is wonderful and Bond's sidekick, in the opening scenes, turns out to be someone we know and love. The new Q looks like a 12 year-old geek and is very likable.  There is a surprise ending, which means there will be some changes in the next film.  Craig brings a complex heart and soul to the Bond character.  He is interesting to watch.  He's tough, guarded, does what has to be done, regardless of the cost, and yet he seems lost and conflicted.  M tells him that ""orphans"" make the best agents...and maybe she's right.  Craig is far less superficial than the other Bonds (although I love Sean). The villain garners our sympathy on some level.  He has been severely damaged and abused by the Agency.  The torture and abuse made him what he is.  All in all it's a great film and Daniel Craig is an exceptional Bond.",1360713600,,1560,4.280821917808219
5036207,5,B006X040NY,"Before continuing, I will warn you that this review contains some small spoilers.  I tried to minimize giving away plot points, but people complain when I write reviews without giving a plot summary, so. . .

Bond Tradition?
If you are a long-time fan of the Bond movies, and you're looking for more of the same, you may be a bit disappointed.  Skyfall is not like the Sean Connery or Roger Moore films.  I would say that Skyfall is more comparable to The Bourne Supremacy than any of the other bond movies.  I think you'll discover, as you read this, that I'm a Bond geek, but I thought it was a great movie, even though a lot of traditions were broken.  I saw it twice within a week.  On the other hand, I didn't much like Quantum of Solace, and the last few movies I saw in a theater were pretty crap, so perhaps Skyfall benefited from low-expectations.

The Adele theme-song, I would say, is pretty traditional.  The lyrics are minimal though, and it's not going to be one of my favorites.  The Walkways rock cover is, at least, more interesting (it's on Youtube.  Dig the kickin' mullet!)

Characters
As far as Daniel Craig's performance goes. . . eh.  Physically, he did a fine job, but as far as acting goes, Craig is outdone by his female co-stars and the villain, I think.  Not a great Bond performance, in my opinion.  The Bond character in the this film is kind of tired and bitter.  Mostly lacking the class and charm of the Bond of old.  One notable exception is when 007 hops off the bucket of the excavator into the train car and straightens his cuffs, while everyone stares at this guy in the suit standing at the edge of the now ruined car.  (Hey, wouldn't someone have STOPPED the train, as all this mayhem was going on, and why hadn't that chain fallen off the top of that train car)

And, then, of course, there is Judy Dench, once again playing ""M.""  I think she outclassed Bond in Skyfall. How great was that speech she gave in the courtroom? Great movie, terrific performance by Dame Judy Dench!

""M"" and ""Q"" take much more active roles in Skyfall than in previous films.  Moneypenny reappears, which I think is pretty awesome, but you may be a little surprised to find out who it is.

Field agent Eve, is played by Naomi Harris, who you may remember as Tia Dalma (Calypso), the black-toothed pirate wench from the latter two Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  She looks pretty amazing in that Gold dress.  I thought that Ms. Harris also upstaged Craig, giving several small but very impactful moments.

Raoul Silva, played by Javier Bardem, is the villian.  You may remember Mr. Bardem as the assassin in No Country For Old Men.  Formerly an MI6 agent who worked for M, Silva was taken captive, and tortured.  Politically unable to help him, M had no choice but to leave him be, and he was left phyically and mentally scarred, and blames it all on M, and makes it his mission to get to her and kill her.  It would seem that Silva is homosexual, and there are several creepy moments between James Bond and Silva.  Silva's first real appearance in the film is a rather melodramatic monologue for Bond, about a barrel full of rats.  At one point, Silva tells his goons not to harm M; that they were to leave M intact, for him to deal with personally.  A little cliche, idn't it?

Watching the movie, I'm sitting there thinking that ""Mallory"" is being played by real British tough guy Ranulph Fiennes, but no, it's just plain old actor Ralph Fiennes.  Regardless, Ralph does a great job of it.  When you see the movie, watch him stand up out of the cheap office chair, and stick out his chest, as he addresses Bond. I thought that was perfect.

The baddie goons look like stereotypical baddie goons.  MI6 extras are average clean-cut types.

At the Bond family home (more on that later) we meet Kincade, the gamekeeper.  He has a fairly small part, but he gets in a good number of the jokes.  An older man, I kind of wonder if Kincade sort of has a thing for M, or should I say Emma?

Photography and Sets
Bond gets some more time in the tropics in Skyfall.  At the end of the opening scene, Eve takes a shot at Partrice, even though she can't get a clear shot, but she's ordered to shoot by M, and hits Bond.  Bond falls from the train, which is going over a bridge, and falls, unconscious into the river below.  After the theme song sequence, we find Bond in an island setting.  As he's sitting at a beach-side bar, Bond hears of the attack on MI6 headquarters building.  It's at this point that 007 decides to come out of retirement.

Bond makes his reappearance in England at M's flat, where he waits in the dark, with a bottle of her scotch.  In this scene, in M's flat, it looks like the camera was shaking.  I'm not sure if that was actually on the film, or if the theater was having ""technical difficulties,"" with the projector.

There's a scene at the beginning of the movie, in M's office, where we are introduced to Mallory.  There are several, large, British electrical outlets visible in the office.  They stick out like sore thumbs.  I would have either hidden them behind furniture or had them removed entirely.

The new MI6 headquarters may not be as cool as the field office in The Man With The Golden Gun, but I though it was pretty impressive.  If you remember the shooting range scene in Die Another Day, it's more of that kind of thing.

I thought all the blue lighting in Shanghai really popped off the screen.  Not entirely sure what the roof-top pool scene was supposed to accomplish though, and shouldn't the letters of the electronic billboard have been reversed, as seen from the inside of the building?

The Macao casino reminds me of Epcot center.  Over-the-top Asian style, with giant illuminated dragons and fireworks and the whole deal.  A bit tacky for a Bond movie, perhaps, but I think it looks good up on the screen.  The Komodo dragon pit is reminiscent of the shark tanks and pools of piranha in multiple 007 movies (You Only Live Twice, Thunderball, License to Kill).  I suppose you could also compare it to the lion scene in Diamonds Are Forever also.

The abandoned chemical plant town was pretty great.  The toppled statue may remind some of you of Goldeneye, either the video game or the movie.  Add in the music from the Victrola though, and it reminds me of the moments before the battle of Ramelle in Saving Private Ryan.

Toward the end of the movie, M and 007 retreat to the Bond family home. . . in Scotland.  They stop for a moment, shrouded in fog, to look over the mountains, and presumably for 007 to reflect on his childhood.  Perhaps this helps explain the accent of Sean Connery's Bond, but not Daniel Craig's. . . but I digress.  The Bond family home is an old stone mansion, that appears to have been mothballed for decades, presumably since James was a teen, at least.

Silva makes another rather dramatic entrance, flying to the Bond home in a helicopter with music playing through a large loudspeaker, a bit like that scene from Apocalypse Now.  Nobody surfs.

I was a bit disappointed that the flags weren't set to half-staff in the closing scene on the London roof-top.  Show a little respect, eh?

Gadgets
MI6 has another new quartermaster.  The new guy is a hacker, naturally, and commands all the computer gadgets.  All Bond get is a Walther PPK/S pistol (yup, that's what ""Q"" said) with a palm reader, and a tiny radio.  Q quips that MI6 doesn't go in for exploding ball-point pens anymore (another Goldeneye reference).

The assassin, Patrice, probably gets the coolest gadgets in the film.

If you've been paying attention, you've probably heard that the Aston Martin from Goldfinger makes a reappearance.  Real Bond geeks will get a laugh out of the scene where ""M"" is complaining about the car.

Product Placement
When Bond gets into the excavator, and starts to operate it, the camera holds for a little too long on his left wrist, giving you a good look at his watch.  Later in the tube station 007 walks past a couple big wristwatch ads.

Overall
This Bond geek is very happy with Skyfall.",1360713600,,8082,4.512749827705031
5036208,3,B006X040NY,"Just to give a different perspective from all the 5 star rave reviews...there are a lot of good things about this movie (the cinematography is stunning, especially the scenes in Shanghai), but a lot of big disappointments. Frankly the worst thing is the overhyped performance by Javier Bardem as the villain, dull and boring!!! From the moment he appears onscreen, the movie drags to a long, drawn out conclusion. A movie worth seeing? Sure. The best Bond ever? Not even close!!! We missed all the clever high tech gadgets very much.

The locations shots are beautiful. The night scene in shanghai was gorgeous.

5036214,5,B006X040NY,"The musical score for Skyfall is a masterpiece. Although I love Adelle's contribution, I am in awe over Thomas Newman's score. It is always a challenge for Bond films to do three things well: 1. Satisfy the Bond fanatics (count me in)  2. Make the current film's music unique- a work unto itself  3. Make the current film great.
  The orchestral score is totally recognizable as being Bond. Compare this to the last Bond movie- what a disaster! Alas, there is no solace to be found. I paid to see a Bond movie- and I want Bond music. Yes- this is my immature tantrum, but there is no need to cry now. I thought I died and went to heaven when the garage door went up an the Aston Martin DB5. Thank you Mr. Newman for that delight- it wouldn't have been the same without the classic Bond theme music! Chill bumps!
  Secondly, the music is so good- such a fine work unto itself that I am purchasing the score. Listen to it on your way to work or on your ipod while exercising. WOW. once again- kudos to Mr. Newman!
  Finally- never underestimate the importance of a movie's music. George Lucas had it right when he said it is ""half of the movie"". Star Wars is a great movie- but would have only been ""good"" if not for John Williams. Instead of cheesy synthesizer music, the full orchestral score makes it timeless. The Skyfall score is a huge reason for its success. One brilliant scene- listen to the driving percussion that electrifies Bond's fight with the assassin. It's an instant classic!
  Thomas Newman pulled it off- on all three accounts! Here's to hoping he does the next one!",1360713600,,1584,4.449826989619377
5036215,5,B006X040NY,"A debate rages within my household. Is Daniel Craig the best Bond ever?

As a traditionalist I had argued that Sean Connery has no peer among the half dozen or so actors who have played 007 on the big screen. Skyfall has undercut my argument. Daniel Craig has emerged as a worthy pretender to the crown. Not only that Skyfall itself just may be the best movie in the franchise surpassing even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goldfinger-50th-Anniversary-Repackage-Blu-ray/dp/B008YKV1T2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goldfinger (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray</a>].

Skyfall opens with a chase through the streets and environs of Istanbul, first seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Russia-with-Love-50th-Anniversary-Repackage-Blu-ray/dp/B008YKV1YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Russia with Love (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray</a>]. In a thrilling chase across the top of a moving train, Bond is the victim of friendly fire and plunges headfirst off a railroad bridge into a raging river where his body is swept over a waterfall. Bond is dead. Of course not. Bond is simply enjoying being dead until the London headquarters of MI-6 explode right in front of M's eyes. Bond returns from the dead and after taking a return to duty fitness exam (which he obviously flunks) is sent back into the field and equipped with a new gun and a radio by the new Q, a computer nerd.

What follows is vintage Bond. M and Bond chase the mastermind of the London bombing, a former MI6 agent Raoul Silva, fiendishly portrayed by Javier Bardem. Silva has acquired a list of undercover NATO agents around the world and those agents are being eliminated one by one.

Ultimately the hunt leads back to London and then to Scotland for the final confrontation. In the Bond world, when its man against machine, the machines do a lot of damage but ultimately lose. Fortunately for Bond, he has a few machine's of his own including his classic ejector seat equipped Aston Martin DB5.

Is Skyfall as good as Goldfinger? The production values are much higher, but then again it has been almost 50 years since Auric Goldfinger planned to nuke Fort Knox. The plots have as many holes and improbabilities as ever. But that what makes Bond movies so fun.

So in an effort to bring peace to my household, I will say that Skyfall is the best Bond movie ever, but the mighty Scot Sean Connery is still, barely, the greatest Bond.",1360713600,2,2497,5.439276485788113

This was delivered as advertised and when promised. Amazon did a great job with this!

As for the movie, it is not Connery. But it isn't meant to be. And it isn't a re imagining of the Bond character which so many of the films (and later books) are.  we have noticed that except for QoS, the producers have been trying quite successfully in melding the bonds of before with this latest outing. We now know how bond became 007, how he became who he is.  And now we are seeing how the sets of the Bond films can get rolled back to the classic versions. Witness the last scene.

And we see how the we can return from Buffoon Bond (Moore) through Dapper Boy Bond (Brosnan) and become Believable Bond (Craig). Unlike all the others, Craig plays the character straight.

Sean Connery was the perfect Movie Bond.  His toughness, and his sense of humor (totally missing from any of Fleming s books) and gadgets (done to an embarrassment by the Moore Bond) were staples of the early years.  But none were a part of Fleming's creation.

If Connery is the Cinematic Bond, Craig is the Literary Bond. Craig , especially in this outing, plays a human Bond. He bleeds, gets hurt, gets angry, throw a tantrum, and nearly weeps (shades of Vesper!)

The charge has been made that the plot was a rip-off of many others - even Mission Impossible.  I concede to that, but the Bond, laddies, the Bond!  This movies wan;t meant to be the stand alone comfortable fare we are used to seeing. It has a depth which takes bond from being a 2 dimensional cut out character, to a 3 dimensional human being. patriot and all. Included we see his attachment to M, the new Miss Moneypenny and how she got to where she is, how Britain finally rids itself of that target on Vauxhall and so on and so on.

If you want or expect the usual 007 Kiss Kiss Bang Bang this is not it. But if you want to look deeper into the character and see Bond as FLEMING - not Broccoli - saw him, then you won't be disappointed.",1360627200,,2042,4.31413612565445

Many of you know that if you bought either of the 1st two Daniel Craig Bond movies on their 1st release, then you got burned for not waiting for the much better and far more content-filled releases of each of those movies were released several months after of each of their initial releases.

Special Features: ""None""? Not according to blu-ray.com!, February 9, 2013
By J. Rosenberg ""pop culturalist""
This review is from: Skyfall (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy) (Blu-ray)
The excellent blu-ray.com lists a wealth of special features on the Skyfall blu-ray, as follows:

""Commentary with Director Sam Mendes: Mendes provides a true ""scene-specific"" commentary, and it's obvious he's still very close to the process of making the film, as he recalls details of revising the script, shooting individual scenes (and revising key moments to incorporate suggestions from actors, especially Bardem), working with editor Stuart Baird and the contributions of various effects houses and other departments. Along the way, he provides valuable insights into his directing strategies, particularly in staging difficult moments like the film's emotional climax.

Commentary with Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner: This is something of a mix of the old and new guard, as Gassner only joined the franchise with Quantum of Solace, whereas Broccoli and Wilson are the second-generation keepers of the tradition. Gassner is by far the most voluble of the participants, but overall this is a more relaxed and less dense commentary track, with brief but frequent pauses. Much of the running time is spent simply admiring what's on screen, although the participants do slip in some interesting stories along the way.

Shooting Bond (1080p; 1.78:1; 59:24): Whether viewed as a single documentary or as individual featurettes, this comprehensive overview of the production of Skyfall demonstrates what can be accomplished when a documentary crew follows a production from the beginning and then edits together the best material. Here you'll find input from most of the major department heads (with the notable absence of editor Stuart Baird), as well as the principal cast, the writers, the producers and director Mendes. For those who don't have the patience for commentaries, this is the place to learn how Skyfall was made. (Caution, however; the documentary assumes you've seen the film.)

I actually liked the deeper psychic interest in the man... he became more than a cartoon character... but... .

There is a silly Joy in the Character... an irreverent humor in the face death... and a sexy something... that was not often there in this film... so much personal history submerged every other aspect of a Bond film that is light hearted, sexy and other worldly cool.

That said I would not drop the depth of character but rather bring back some of the gadgets... cleaver one liners, babes and romance and happy confidence... .

The first movie with this Bond with the repartee between Bond and what became his love interest on the train was extremely well written and that kind of new Bond I approve of.

It is hard to write a Bond film since 911/7/7 because of their core lie that many in the audience are aware of that makes all political pretenses of glory and patriotism sour.

I would love to see another Goldfinger remake. Gold is now such an important controversy in the face of abject theft in all markets and the currency wars... that it is a natural theme.",1360627200,,1262,4.422413793103448
5036222,5,B006X040NY,"I am a HUGE Bond fan. I bought the entire set on DVD a few years back, and I bought the Blu-ray set a few months ago. Bond really defined my childhood. The Bond of my childhood was Pierce Brosnan, and I really loved Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies. The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day are really lackluster. I have seen every single Bond movie. Some I have seen several times, but others I have only seen once. Sean Connery is my absolute favorite Bond of all time, followed by Daniel Craig. Lazenby comes 3rd, Dalton and Brosnan are tied for 4th, and Moore comes dead last.

When I saw Casino Royale back in '06 all my doubts and fears about the character suffering a slow, bloated, and ridiculous death were assuaged. Daniel Craig revived Bond's deadly edge. He gave the character a sense of urgency that had not been present since Goldeneye. Casino Royale, as it were, breathed new life into Bond. Of course, I was really disappointed with Quantum of Solace. Quantum of Solace was bound to be a bit of a let down because it was following such a masterful reboot. But, I did not expect it to suck quite so much. It was disjointed and ridiculous at times. But, I still managed to enjoy it. It was a Bond movie treading new ground. Immediately picking up where the previous one left off. QoS had some flashes of brilliance hiding in the wreckage, but it was ultimately unsatisfying.

Skyfall was really a make or break movie for Bond. I theorized that another bad movie would have sent Daniel Craig packing, and the entire series put on the drawing board again. It simply could not afford another misstep. Luckily, Skyfall knew EXACTLY which buttons to push. In essence, I believe that Skyfall managed to give Bond back some of his panache. Craigs' Bond had been pretty dry up until this point. Now he's in his final form. The entire movie is really about James Bond becoming the 007 we know and love. The final scene of the movie is absolutely invigorating. More than Casino Royale, that one scene gives Bond his deadly confidence back. I honestly cannot wait until the next one comes out.

I only hope that this level of sophistication can be replicated for the next movie.

Oh, and for owners of the Blu-Ray set. Remember that extra slot that was reserved for Skyfall? I feared that the Skyfall blu-ray would stick out like a sore thumb. I honestly thought that the blu-ray would have a different design than the rest. Luckily, it does not. It fits right it. The only thing is that they made the disc cover white instead of black, but it fits right in. I love it when they do fans a service like that.",1360627200,,2614,4.485294117647059

Apparently the producers were too busy counting their 1 billion dollar box office receipts to give extras to the DVD and Blueray consumer. You will however get 4 or 5 comercials at the beginning of the DVD you paid for that cannot be skipped with the disc menu or scene skip button. They needed to pepper you with commercials whether you wanted to see them or not.

Repeated references to age of many characters segued into actor changes; but was a little heavy handed.  The finish of the movie was coontrived.

When the villain is done chit-chatting the henchman now has his gun pressed against Bond, so now Bond can disarm him and get away! This is not a one time ordeal, it happens at least three times in Skyfall.

The plot isn't even that great. It's a chase movie, basically, with the villain being a computer hacker. Yawn! The movie is acted well by all the cast members which is why ratings are higher than they should be, but it's just not that exciting. The opening gets you all pumped up, and the rest of the movie lets you down. And seriously, the Home Alone ending?

Daniel Craig was very good in the role of James Bond, but he fell through the cracks of a weak/predictable script that lowered the effectiveness of the other characters and the movie itself. While the action and cinematography were very good, it didn't make up for the fact that you can watch movies with similar scenarios that have a much lower budget and lower expectations. My attention wasn't held enough to think of this than more than an average action movie. Casino Royal had a great script, characters, and was a great Bond movie.

5036248,4,B006X040NY,"(This review talks about details of the film in broad strokes, but if you want a zero-spoiler viewing experience, stop reading Amazon and watch the movie!  You'll like it.)

Despite what critics always had to say, I never minded the ""Bond Formula:"" cool stunts, rich locations, fancy cars and unobtainable women, all carried off by an unflappable alcoholic who's better than everyone at everything.  It worked well enough so far, and I never needed it to change.  When 2006's Casino Royale came out, I found that I enjoyed the change-up, but I also left the movie glad that the stage was set for more ""formula"" outings.

Unfortunately, someone thought one emotional detour wasn't enough.  And so they made Quantum of Solace, seemingly believing that they could make a never-ending series about a moody sad-sack.

Well, with ""Skyfall,"" it looks like producer Barbara Broccoli may have finally found a way to move forward.

Yes, the film feels like another reboot, and yes, Bond girls are again pushed to the corners, but by the end of this film we have classic characters back where we need them, psychological conflicts purged, and a mature Bond who's ready to pursue the bad guy with the casual detachment he's been missing for the last three films.

Skyfall itself is imperfect but usually entertaining.  For starters, Bond is past pining over dead girls, and he has the humanity the character used to have in the Connery days.  So he can stop and help someone who's hurt while not sobbing over it.  The lack of ""emo"" also makes room for lots of clever, witty dialogue between the talented cast of actors.

The action is pretty good but Casino Royale's was better.  Visually, however, this film is peerless.  The ""travelogue"" aspects of Bond films stopped working for audiences long ago, but this film brings them back and they feel like a revelation.  Every location gets to show off at its most stunning and exotic.  I wish I'd seen this in IMAX.  The film also tries a few new steps regarding sexuality (you'll know the scene when you see it), and while the angle is a new one, it really harkens back to the early Connery days, when the Bond films were actually considered sexually progressive.

Everyone's talking about the villain, and he is in fact pretty memorable.  The writers definitely watched The Dark Knight's Joker a few times, but if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best!  He's another crazy person with an improbably precise plan that seems to anticipate every move the good guys make.

I said the movie is imperfect.  Its implausibility hurts it a bit, especially at the climax.  Logic just goes away, and that's difficult to forgive considering the stakes.  Also, there's a character toward the end that was clearly written for one very particular actor, for the series' 50th anniversary.  And when That One Actor does not appear, you're left with the equivalent of a drunken stand-in.  The part just doesn't make sense without That One Actor, and they should have cut the role when he refused it.

Despite its flaws and dramatic themes, ""Skyfall"" finds its way back to the ""fun"" Bond formula of years past.  Here's a medium-dry hoping there's more fun to be had in the future.",1360540800,,3205,4.797445255474453

However, Javier Bardem played probably the best/creepiest Bond villain in years.

This movie is insulting to the Bond legacy and it's shameful that this is what they put out as the 50th anniversary chapter.  ""Magic"" guns, ridiculous plot holes and a PC gay villain was too much.  With the Roger Moore/70s days, completely ridiculous  action and plot holes were part of the gag.  These modern Bond movies have generally been well-made and technically correct other than the made up gadgets.  This one attempts to be serious yet asks us to believe complete stupidity from ""trained agents"", magical computer hacking and firearms with seemingly unlimited clips.  Trashing the DB (kept in a side street garage but still found clean and restored) wasn't just a cheesy nod but also disrespectful to fans.  I guess they are trying to say that they are leaving the ""old Bond"" behind for the next half century but that is the Bond that most fans want.  The ""dramatic"" death scene of M who manages to hike across a big field and deal with the villain while hardly showing any discomfort after being shot but dies in Bond's arms after their necessary good-bye dialogue made me laugh.

5036255,5,B006X040NY,"Let's face it: after QUANTUM OF SOLACE, we were all kind of hesitant about what kind of film BOND 23 would be.  Even when Sam Mendes, director of the classic AMERICAN BEAUTY, signed on, we were still skeptical.  We all know Daniel Craig brings a certain screen presence to the role; he may not be Sean Connery, but then, Connery's Bond wouldn't necessarily work nowadays.  (Don't get me wrong: love the classic Bond.  Hell, I'm even a Roger Moore fan, don't hold that against me.)  Craig's Bond is a morally flawed creation, a character with a dark heart who (usually) does the right thing for (sometimes) the right reasons.

Here's the trick about SKYFALL, what makes this film work so well: it isn't even about Bond.  The film centers around M (Judi Dench), and her dangerous past, which is personified in the rise of a new villain: Silva.  He's a cyberterrorist who could bring about the collapse of civilized society with the push of a button...but instead, he's using his power to bring M to her knees.  Bond is merely a pawn in his scheme: two rats fighting for survival.  Which animal will triumph, and which will be torn to shreds?

SKYFALL is a brilliant film.  Plain and simple.  It has its flaws, as do all Bond films (even a Moore film wouldn't have stooped to the level of CGI Komodo dragons...well, maybe).  But its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.  Director Mendes has flat-out stated that, without the success of THE DARK KNIGHT, SKYFALL would not have been possible; this is evident, for what KNIGHT did for superhero films, SKYFALL does for the Bond franchise.  (Purists beware: this is a Bond who wears his heart on his sleeve, and you may not like what you see.)  The script is intelligent; that's a rarity for an action film.  The directing is solid.  The scope is broad: shifting Bond into a new era, while at the same time cementing his legacy.  (Fanboys will get a few delights.)

But what this film really comes down to is the caliber of acting.  Craig gives his best Bond to date, but even he's out-shined by the supporting cast.  In her expanded role, Dench is a marvel.  It's been refreshing to see her interacting with Craig; here, their chemistry truly comes alive, as two brilliant actors get to take their roles to new levels.  Ralph Fiennes, as a bureaucrat who sees the 00 program as antiquated, is subtle; his performance slowly builds on itself, as his best usually do.  Ben Whishaw and Albert Finney breathe some fresh blood into things; as far as ""Bond girls,"" we have Naomie Harris, whose character is perhaps the least fleshed-out, and an especially good Berenice Marlohe.  But as we all know, a great Bond film is nothing without a great villain, and Javier Bardem gives us one of the best (in my mind, THE best) the franchise has to offer.  Silva is a menace; he's maniacal and unpredictable, a sociopath bent on a vicious, kamikaze vendetta.  He's truly unhinged, and for good reason; as crazy and manipulative as he gets (his opening scene is a brilliant choreography of psychological manipulation; some viewers have gotten a little antsy, but pay attention and you'll understand), you can't help but sympathize with him.  And that is the core brilliance of SKYFALL: it's an intensely personal film, so much so that viewers get sucked into the story despite the typical Bond locales and damseles in distress.  SKYFALL is a great Bond movie; some have said it's the greatest, but that's really a matter of taste.  What's hard to deny is that, no matter where it ranks in the Bond cannon, SKYFALL is simply a great movie.  Period.",1360540800,39,3578,4.691813804173354
5036256,5,B006X040NY,"There's not much to say about this film that hasn't been said.  The movie is fantastic.  Casino Royale is just a notch higher, but this one is right with it.  This is what they should have done after CR, not QoS.  Anyway, don't take my word for it, this is a AAA title, with all the goodness that a major movie studio puts behind a release like this.  Looks great, sounds great, movie is great.

I mainly wanted to write about the digital copy situation.  There is a single code inside here that can be redeemed for multiple digital copies.

iTunes: The code will let you redeem for an SD version from the iTunes store.  It requires you to put in the DVD disc from the package, but once that's done copying, go to your iTunes library and delete it (but don't delete from iCloud - this assumes you are using iTunes in the Cloud, if you are not, you can skip all this).  Once you've finished doing that, go to the iTunes store, select movies, and then purchased.  In there, you'll find Skyfall with a cloud download icon (assuming you deleted it from before).  Download it again.  It will also download the iTunes extras with the movie.  That's one of the nice features of iTunes in the Cloud with movies.  It's still SD, but at least we're getting an iTunes digital copy from a studio that probably doesn't want to give you one in the first place.

Ultaviolet: While I'm not a fan of UV, I recognize it has some weight behind it studio wise.  The same code will work here, and there's plenty of places you can redeem a UV code.  The card gives you a URL to go to - I suggest ignoring that, and going through the vudu site, as when I redeemed my code there, they gave me an HDX version of the movie, which is their ""ultra High def"" version - a higher bitrate than regular HD.  So that's a bonus.

But I can't recommend this movie highly enough, no matter what the digital copy situation is.  There was some confusion about digital copies pre-release, and now that it's actually out (got mine a day early from USPS), I wanted to post something about really is going on with the digital copies.

UPDATE: Forgot to mention that the card inside the box says the digital copy redemption code expires on Feb 12, 2015.

UPDATE 2: You can redeem the one code inside the box for BOTH an iTunes copy *AND* a UV Digital Copy.  You don't have to pick one or the other.",1360540800,26,2354,4.309794988610478

5036258,2,B006X040NY,"I'll preface my review that spoilers are not entirely intentional, but may occur. Read on with that in mind.

This movie received a fair amount of critical praise. It's no surprise with critical darling Sam Mendes at the helm. Mendes immediately dives into the theme of the cost of ""the game"", and his approach is reasonably characteristic of the superficially insincere cynicism coloring the fading western world. Bond is contemptuously pasted into the movie as an aging, wooden relic reluctantly prodded back into action by an equally aging director mired in self-doubt. Though the opening of the movie hints at a possible struggle within Bond toward his profession, this is never really explored in him to any significant degree. Bond is almost an afterthought. When he finally comes face to face with his shadowy antagonist, Bond's complete lack of emotional depth and humor greatly lessens the impact of an excellent performance by Javier Bardem; perhaps the high point of the movie. Where Bond is wooden, Bardem is vital. The questions Bond never asks come through with humor, passion and rage in Bardem. Bardem's goal, however, is never defined enough to justify the performance. The movie is poorly written and the theme fizzles and dies.

It's apparent the modern critical film body despises the Bond idea. It was created in a dark and unsure time, and represented an attitude willing to approach it all with a laugh and a wink. Our modern culture takes itself far too seriously to appreciate that sort of attitude, and this Bond reflects it well. What's left is an empty shell surrounded by mockery...scolding us for appreciating the levity the Bond figure once represented. The Bond name still makes a lot of money, so they keep rolling it out. I have to believe toward the start of the film, when Bond's death is limply suggested if we weren't seeing the true thrust of 'Skyfall'. The movie has nice production and some legitimately solid performances, however as a lifelong Bond fan, I can't recommend it at all. If the modern world wishes Bond dead, let him die. Make new heroes. You might discover why the old names continue to make so much money.",1360540800,3,2162,4.904371584699454

5036261,1,B006X040NY,"Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig seem to be watching too much Harry Potter. First of all the initial action sequence is ridiculous. James Bond runs out of ammo and gets in the driver seat of a backhoe with no cover, real smart right, shooting fish in barrel doesn't even cut it. Hes gotten into several types of construction equipment with some sort of cover, but a backhoe, with a tiny bucket REALLY?. Maybe he wanted to dig a hole while on a moving train so they could burry him after his incompetent partner(Naomie Harris is Moneypenny, Really?) which he's not supposed to have in the first place shoots him. Then there's the scene where bond sneaks up on Patrice while sniping to just watch him kill a random guy who Bond gives no importance to, he then manages to get into a fistfight with Patrice who he had the upper hand on in the most foolish of ways. Now we add Javier Bardem to the mix. The villain who just wanted to grab Bonds Sack. Oh, I forgot to mention that Bond gets to visit his Hogwarts lookalike mansion with his Hagrid lookalike housekeeper, who does no housekeeping at all. Remind me why was he hanging around the place again? Oh, it doesn't make any sense either. I forgot to mention that Bond went Mcguyver on us setting shotgun shells under the floorboards.

I'm just really disappointed in this film. It's clear that the goal was to revitalize the series by adding elements that would attract the crowds that don't normally support a bond film. Hence all the hype that was built up before release. Well congratulations Mendes, you accomplished your goal and you pissed off the majority of the loyal fans of the series, throw some ""Twilight"" into the next one and I'll stop watching Bond until they drop you!

While I welcomed with open arms the unpolished Bond in casino Royale, much needed after 20 films, and I enjoyed Quantum of Solace, this film just insulted every ounce of James Bond fan in me. I almost walked out of the theater. Now I can never have a Complete James Bond Set because this atrocity will never get near my shelf.",1360540800,13,2057,4.526881720430108
5036262,5,B006X040NY,"In this reviewer's not so humble opinion, a movie marketing campaign finally delivered as advertised! THIS IS THE BEST BOND MOVIE EVER!!! Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed Sean Connery, the original Bond, in all of his Bond glory, and recurring resurrections of the 007 character, but I always had a problem with the way the previous Bonds had no problem or reflection in killing people, no remorse, they could plug a bad guy one minute and then crack a joke the very next scene. If James Bond existed, he'd be haunted by the lives he's taken. He'd struggle everyday with the lawful transgressions he committed in the name of country; unable to completely come too terms with what he's done, but always understanding that it was for the greater good, civic virtue if you will. Daniel Craig embodies that type of ""realistic"" Bond. Haunted by his actions facing the consequences of his decisions wether he was justified or not.

Director Sam Mendes has done a fantastic job with the imagery captured in the film. The cinematography is top notch, breathtaking in some instances, i.e. the Shanghai sequences. When you really get down to what makes a great film, it's the resonant images that linger with you and ultimately comprise your memories of the film. Skyfall gives you some very creative and striking memories to say the least! Mendes also does a great job with the pacing of the film scene by scene. In previous Bond entries I believe directors were easily swept away by the action mechanisms that are inherent in films like this, and get carried away with the speed of the content, force feeding the audience a traditional ho-hum action movie as oppose to taking their time and letting the story devlop into something special via witty dialogue and atmospheric scenery mixed in with technically sound action sequences. Mendes weaves all aspects together seamlessly, creating the most memorably Bond experience I've ever had. A beautiful Bond Quilt if you will.

Performance wise, Daniel Craig continues his top notch acting as a darker version of Bond; facial expressions that relay emotions that words would never communicate on camera are scattered throughout the film along with his distinctively, dry charm. Ultmately, Javier Bardem steals the show though. A villain you fear, at the same time find humorous, all the while rooting against him eventhough you understand where he's coming from. I have no other words to describe Bardem's performance except ""RIVETING"". Tell me that I'm wrong on this and I""ll call ya a liar! Behind your back of course, never to your face.

All in all, the most outstanding Bond ever made, and a film that should've absolutly been nominated for Best Picture! We agree on that Roger Moore!",1360540800,25,2736,4.93058568329718
5036263,3,B006X040NY,"WARNING: Spoilers within. Do not continue to read this review if you don't want the film spoiled.

While I had high hopes that Skyfall could redeem the Bond series in a post cold-war era world, truth be told this is one of the weakest Bond films I've seen.  I'd compare this to near Living Daylights and Octopussy in story quality. In actuality, Living Daylights and Octopussy were both a bit more entertaining than this film. I don't envy the writers, though. It's going to be difficult to write engaging stories when the there's not really a single world power that is a threat. Although, the writers should bring back SPECTRE.  At least that would give Bond a worthy nemesis instead of some rogue ex-agent.

Story

The story is all wrong for a Bond film and very linear. Bond is never about keeping M safe (or any other operative).  In keeping with what Fleming designed for this character, it's about retrieving whatever data is necessary to keep the world (or at least Britain) safe.  If the best that the writers could come up with for a complete story is threatening and then the death of M (Judi Dench's character), I'd have preferred it to be as a sideline story, not as the main story. Meaning, the whole M story should have been a side story in among the main narrative. Yes, she was in danger, but it's more important to keep Britain safe than her.  That's what the agents signed up to do. It would have been a whole lot more relevant if Bond had had to make a choice between M's life or keeping his country safe.  That's the kind of story that makes sitting through a Bond film worthwhile.

This is, by no means, anywhere close to what Ian Fleming would have ever written for Bond. Skyfall begs the question, is it time for the Bond film series to end?  If the best the writers can create is an entire story about M's death stretched out to 2h 23m, then there's really no hope for this series. This film's plot completely underscores the lack of story inventiveness in today's storytellers and screen writers.

On top of this, Bond should always be portrayed as suave, debonair, dashing, sophisticated, humorous and deadly. He should never be portrayed as an aging, has-been agent who's nearly washed up and can barely fire a gun.  Again, an extremely poor story choice unless they're planning on firing Daniel Craig after this film.  Seriously, 3 films and you're gonna fire Mr. Craig?  Worse, how do you even explain off this has-been storyline now? They've definitely written Bond into a bind.

Actors and casting

The main villain choice in this role is a gay ex-MI6 operative named Silva (Javier Bardem) who's bent on revenge because he damaged himself by breaking open his cyanide tooth?  And, he's going to blame this on M?  These agents know what they're getting into. Worse, we're supposed to believe that MI6 is really stupid enough to not be able to locate a missing agent, track down his remains or know whether or not he's alive? Again, more deranged story choices. I digress. The actor chosen for this role is very miscast. He's no where near villainous enough, especially with that silly and awful wig. Specifically, I could barely even deal with his out of place smirks and mannerisms. It makes him silly rather than ominous. I'd have preferred to see Tim Curry in this role if I wanted to see that.

In fact, the replacement M actor, Ralph Fiennes, would have made a fantastic villain. Unfortunately, he's also miscast and an extremely poor choice as a replacement M.  Q is way too young and doesn't fit the part. About the only actress who works in Skyfall is Ms. Moneypenny (Naomie Harris).  Even though, most scenes between Moneypenny and Bond were just awkward enough to not really work.

What worked?

Not a whole heck of a lot.  The gadgets were sparse, the guns were sparse, the plot devices were thin and Bond's choices in dealing with Silva were completely questionable. The best parts of this film were the scenery, the cinematography, the soundtrack and the car chases. At least the chases were engaging, if not for the silly story reasons they were involved in them.

Stars

At best, I'm giving this 3 stars.  It really deserves about 2.5 stars, but I can't give that on Amazon. The only reason I'm giving Skyfall 3 stars is because Daniel Craig did his level best to make the story work, even as poorly written as it is. I'd also give it 3 stars because for what story is there, it does work on a very simplistic single-story-arc level. Other than the main story, there's not a whole heck of a lot else going on.  There are no substories, no innuendos, no famous bond humor. Just a lot of one-tracked chasing, running and dying all to a very simple end premise. Sad that Bond has come down to this.

The three top films of 2012 were the Avengers, Skyfall and The Dark Knight Rises. All three were written and directed by men born post-baby boom, so called Generation X. Existential angst and uncertainty are central to the main characters and in many ways the generational experience. As much fun as Roger Moore's Bond was, a fifty year old man lusting after 20 year old women and winking at the camera wouldn't fly today. Likewise the narcissism and preening of baby boomer Pierce Brosnan (who I also liked).

5036273,5,B006X040NY,"I don't know why other people seem to despise this film, but for myself I found it quite disturbing. After getting shot off the train Bond seems changed, drinking Rolling Rock beer, my favorite as well, living I guess in some Island or Tropical location that is off the map as though he has lost his nerve. M is under the gun to explain the latest disaster to befall the MI-6, actually a  plot against M herself. For a while you don't know if Bond, grizzled and looking like something the cat has brought in, is OK upstairs. He looks old and tired and you get the feeling that the person looking to destroy M, may well succeed and Bond while not playing dead, is out of touch and lets people think that if they wish., the last words from M he knew was for a stationary agent to take a shot and take out the traitor that Bond is fighting with one a fast moving trains roof attempting to retrieve what amounts to is a complete list of agency's spies and it seems to be connected to some decision M made in the past as cryptic messages tell her to confess her sins.  But it is Bond who is hit, feeling betrayed by someone who he thought had his back and had faith in him, that he wasn't trusted to finish his assignment and that M*s course of action could have been a fatal one, Bond is shaky upon his return, unable to shoot straight or make it thru a series of tests to see if he is stil lup to snuff and we don't know if he has something in mind for M himself in way of payback. The movie is not typical Bond, its more about the character of the people who work for the M-16 and whether under M they are fighting today's spy wars with yesterdays tactics.

  There are tense moments all along yet the action scenes are tepid, I will grant the less then thrilled folks that, but its not the action that this movie is about. Its about the old world and the new world of counterintelligence and the irony of M being in the same position as Bond. Of being shot down to avoid any more catastrophes for which she takes full responsibility and intends to correct before her forced retirement. Like Bond she too feels that she has not been given the fair chance to fix this dire threat.

  All in all it was an interesting psychological piece on Bond and M, and what happens when they are questioned by their employers for whom they have worked hard and never let down. Till the finale epilogue I was certain that this was where Bond having had enough was going to retire. Im going to miss Judi Dentch as M. I don't know what I think of the new Q, who seemed quite green and wet behind the ears.
  So yes between the shootings and chases I did find a very disturbing mental profile that one can extract as one sees it, about Bond and M that make the movie a must see.",1360454400,2,2758,4.1770244821092275

Plot holes so thin a train could drive through it; a character so tortured that it's unbearable to watch; and a ""have to get to it ending"" so contrived that it musses up pacing.

The entire story revolves around/requires James Bond to act counter to every incarnation of James Bond so as to make this movie, in my opinion, the worst of the lot.  He has a licesene to kill...not a license to talk - and for a reason.  The Bond from Casino Royale was awesome...much better than this ""Home Alone"" Bond who doesn't shoot a bad guy on a ladder when he has the perfect shot and, instead, waits for a train to barrow through.

Their gimmick is to call any action movie ""Bond."" That way they're sure to get audiences in droves simply by virtue of that name. Well, these are no longer Bond movies, and it's fraudulent on the part of the filmmakers to call them Bond movies. I'm not saying I want to go back to campy bond, I'm saying that the franchise should be put to rest. It engendered some great movies and anyone that wants to see Bond can watch them.

Back to Skyfall. When they went to Bond's childhood orphanage to wait for the so-called killers, that did it for me. I couldn't go on. It occurred to me just how terrible this movie was.

5036281,4,B006X040NY,"The excellent blu-ray.com lists a wealth of special features on the Skyfall blu-ray, as follows:

""Commentary with Director Sam Mendes: Mendes provides a true ""scene-specific"" commentary, and it's obvious he's still very close to the process of making the film, as he recalls details of revising the script, shooting individual scenes (and revising key moments to incorporate suggestions from actors, especially Bardem), working with editor Stuart Baird and the contributions of various effects houses and other departments. Along the way, he provides valuable insights into his directing strategies, particularly in staging difficult moments like the film's emotional climax.

Commentary with Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and Production Designer Dennis Gassner: This is something of a mix of the old and new guard, as Gassner only joined the franchise with Quantum of Solace, whereas Broccoli and Wilson are the second-generation keepers of the tradition. Gassner is by far the most voluble of the participants, but overall this is a more relaxed and less dense commentary track, with brief but frequent pauses. Much of the running time is spent simply admiring what's on screen, although the participants do slip in some interesting stories along the way.

Shooting Bond (1080p; 1.78:1; 59:24): Whether viewed as a single documentary or as individual featurettes, this comprehensive overview of the production of Skyfall demonstrates what can be accomplished when a documentary crew follows a production from the beginning and then edits together the best material.

Bond has been many things over the years, but he's never been depicted as incompetent before.  Think about it - a spy with serious mommy issues kidnaps his boss, the head of the secret service, and gets her killed.  In what universe would this spy be able to continue on at his job instead of spending the rest of his life in some secret blacksite being water-boarded?

5036301,3,B006X040NY,"With the movie's title Skyfall, one might anticipate grand action and events that matter on a global scale. The movie makers instead have decided to go for a more ""personal"" touch for the events.

Without any spoilers, that is not bad at all, I'm just missing the link to the figure Daniel Craig played in the movies before, where he used to be a tough guy who hardly showed any emotion. And I'm missing the reinvention of the ""atomic bomb"" or ""laser"" of previous Bond movies which added meaning on a global scale.

Apart from that, this is a entertaining movie with some bright moments, especially during the intro and the long, interesting and impressive ending. Between that, we meet some surprising characters and follow standard action, nothing more. Therefore, for me, it probably surpasses ""Quantum of Solace"" in quality, but certainly not ""Casino Royale"".",1360195200,,863,4.944827586206896
5036302,2,B006X040NY,"I really wanted to like this film - I heard it was a return to Craig's Casino Royale performance and with the addition of Sam Mendes directing, what can go wrong? Unfortunately, this is one of the least original Bond scripts ever written, fully of faulty logic and plot contrivances.

It starts off with Bond trying to recover a database of spies' real identities (Mission Impossible), gets into a rooftop motorcycle chase (Tomorrow Never Dies), then gets into a fight on a train rooftop (Octopussy) where he gets shot and plummets into the water (The Bourne Identity). MI6 is blown up (The World is Not Enough), their agents are being killed globally (Live and Let Die) and Bond is presumed dead (You Only Live Twice). Bond reverse-engineers a finger print from the bullet (The Dark Knight), is given a custom gun by Q (License To Kill) and flies to Shanghai to recreate the elevator sequence from Diamonds Are Forever. All this chaos is computer controlled, just as in Eagle Eye.

Regardless of all the copied action set pieces, the bad guy's master plan makes no sense at all. It starts out as a Wikileaks-style plot to reveal the identities of all MI6 secret agents and this story is completely forgotten about 45 minutes in. Then it turns into a revenge flick against M where essentially the world's great cyber-terrorist uses near telepathic precision to... get back at his boss. It then goes into Dark Knight territory in an attempt to show Bardem as a fiendish mastermind who uses his capture only to get closer to his end target - but Bardem is no Heath Ledger.

SPOILERS:
The final action piece is really flat for a Bond film, especially one as long as this one. Bond decides to take M to a remote house with no firearms or law enforcement while Bardem's machine-gun-wielding army descends upon them. Two old people and an aging Bond armed with nothing but a rifle and a stiff British upper lip then somehow manage to kill the bad guys in a cringe-worthy sequence where Home Alone meets MacGyver. In the multiple times that Bardem can kill M, he simply doesn't for no reason whatsoever.
END SPOILERS

The dialog throughout the film is atrocious, especially between Bond and Eve, with their witty banter misfiring horribly. There's a really awkward sex scene moment, where Bond establishes that the villain's girl was rescued from the Macau sex trade and in practically the next scene he shows up naked while she's showering. Take away the license to kill and add Bond to the sex offenders registry.

While I can see what the writers were trying to do to update Bond, the endless conversations about new technology and young kids versus the old school wears a little thin. Changing his character from suave, intelligent, incorruptible and indestructible to a broken, aging, shot-up alcoholic isn't good for the franchise either. And where are the gadgets, the girls, and the glamour? It's all a mishmash of every other action film out there minus the things we all like about James Bond.

Overall, it's a very weak script lacking any originality. While it might be a good popcorn flick if you just want to waste a few hours, there are plenty of other better Bond films.

5036308,3,B006X040NY,"I have been continually amazed by how much others seem to love SKYFALL. No doubt, it was very well marketed. I will concede that it is an exciting, entertaining action film with some incredible visuals and action sequences, but I do not think that it is really a very good film, and certainly not among the best Bond films that I have seen. To be fair, this is hardly the only 2012 film that struck me as a case of eye-candy coming at the expense of a well-written story and screenplay. From my perspective, anyway, there is just not much of a coherent story going on here. It aims to get deep into the character of Bond and then end on an intensely personal, epic high note, but without a truly substantive, logical foundation to work off of, the whole thing comes across as a bit forced and contrived, however it may captivate the senses.

The cinematography is great, and I love the Adele theme song. I like Daniel Craig as Bond, and for the most part the rest of the cast as well. (Although the female lead, whatever her name is (not M, not Eve), is pretty disposable.) There are several good conceptual ideas in the mix, but the execution of said ideas does not really come together effectively for me. It feels like a bunch of incredible set pieces that were decided, with the connective tissue linking them only bothered with as an afterthought.

I was tremendously impressed with CASINO ROYALE. QUANTUM OF SOLACE felt more like an average, unpretentious action film; nothing all that great, but fine for entertainment. SKYFALL also strikes me as a decent action film, but a very pretentious one that does not live up to its own hype. Hence, I did not like it as much as QUANTUM, and will probably continue to shudder every time someone tells me how much the loved it. But such is life.",1360195200,3,1793,4.513846153846154

5036313,5,B006X040NY,"It will no doubt reveal my age when I state that I read Ian Fleming before any movie was ever made. I have enjoyed every film, the good and the bad and have always been fascinated how the Bond films reflect changes in both film making and popular culture.  Sometimes, though rarely, The James Bond of film was close to the image that Ian Fleming had in mind when he wrote the original books back in the 1950's and 1960's based on his own experiences during the Second World War and his own personal demons. Sean Connery's early portrayal and the 2 films starring Timothy Dalton came closest to the original character of our violent and troubled super spy and assassin. The world was apparently not ready for the grim reality of  the literary James Bond and preferred the light hearted spy fantasies of the films with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.  Then came Daniel Craig and the conscious decision by the producers to bring back the James Bond of Ian Fleming's novels. 'Casino Royale' and it's extension 'Quantum of Solace' began the transition successfully. Now we finally have the third film with Daniel Craig and the transition is complete.

'Skyfall' is the first James Bond film that can stand on its own independently of the rest of the series. It is a true thriller in the British tradition of  espionage thrillers that go back over 100 years in English thriller novels.  It is no doubt the best film made yet to capture the essence of Ian Fleming's original intent. It will disappoint some who wanted more action, more sexual double entendres, and more humor, but it will please many who have longed for a film that captures the original character and the narrative flow of many of Ian Fleming's novels. Fleming's intent was to recreate the British espionage thriller. 'Skyfall' fulfills that promise in film.

Buyers should be aware that this first release of 'Skyfall' is a bare-bones disk and it will be awhile before we get the followup 2 or 3 disc release with all the commentary and bonus features. Personally I am not falling for the studio's get-rich-quick DVD release and will wait for the complete release which I understand will be released in the UK the same day that this abbreviated release set is planned for the USA.

UPDATE: Amazon had it wrong in its description of the Blu-Ray. The 2-disc Blu-ray does indeed include commentary and a few extras. The second disc contains digital copies of the film. Unfortunately, the extras are not complete and another release is probably in the future. I hope that it will include the new 1 1/2 hour documentary 'Everything or Nothing'",1360108800,6,2600,4.736725663716814

It's got all of the same Bond action, excitement, espionage, romance, and surprises that you'd expect from any Bond film.  There's even a few clever nods to previous Bond films, which are not hard to miss.  I could go into more detail, but why spoil this splendid movie for you?  Five stars!

I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan.

5036329,4,B006X040NY,"On the surface, Skyfall is a really excellent movie. That's because it's a really excellent movie. If you take it as an individual movie and forget that James Bond already exists. That includes forgetting the previous two Daniel Craig Bond films. As an individual movie, it really only has one flaw: its title. The title is a lie and has nothing to do with the movie at all.

Yeah, yeah, I hear those of you out there that have already seen it saying, ""But..."" (and I'm not finishing that sentence, because I'm avoiding the spoiler). It seems pretty obvious to me that the title was arrived at completely separately from the movie. Something like:
""Wouldn't Skyfall be a cool title?""
""Sure, but it has nothing to do with the movie.""
""Well, can't we work it in somehow?""
So, yeah, the ""word"" was just thrown into the movie so that it could be used as a title and has absolutely no meaning whatsoever. I felt a little bit cheated by that. But not really enough for it to take away from the movie experience overall. It's sort of like the pricker you get in your finger while picking blackberries; it's annoying, but it's not gonna keep you from enjoying the cobbler.

So for the movie itself:
The action was great. There was only one bit that I thought really strained plausibility (it had to do with a subway train), so that was pretty good. But, then, these new Bond films have been better at ""keeping it real"" than some of the older ones.

The acting was great. Daniel Craig is a great Bond, and, of course, Judi Dench is just great. Ralph Fiennes is also in this one, and he was surprisingly good. I say ""surprisingly"" because, while he can be great, he is not always great, and this seemed like the kind of role where he was more expected to look good rather than be good, but he was quite good, and I'm glad that his character is one that will (should) be returning.

The tech... well... there's a lot of computer stuff in this, hacking and all sorts of things like that, and, mostly, that was okay, but...
So I was there with my IT/techie friend, and there's this scene where Q is explaining some computer something-or-other with a lot of technobabble, and my friend just starts laughing. Not LOLing or anything, just a sustained chuckle. So I know whatever he was going on about was gibberish, because my friend does the whole computer thing. I'm fairly technologically challenged (just ask my wife), so I probably wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been laughing; I mean, I don't know what they're going on about either way. Well, except for the part where I just sort of assume that it's all meaningless technobabble anyway.

However, as much as I enjoyed it as an individual movie, I was more than a little let down with the movie in terms of its relationship to the other Bond films. There are two main reasons for this:

1. With Casino Royale and the re-boot of the Bond franchise, they created an ongoing story line. Quantum of Solace, while not the greatest Bond film as an individual movie, was an excellent continuation of that story. It felt like they were putting things in place for something really cool, and I was intrigued by where they were going. With Skyfall, though, they just drop that whole story line and, at the moment, have no plans to go back to it. This is incredibly disappointing, and, for that reason, despite how good Skyfall is on its own, it is, itself, also disappointing.

2. Skyfall feels like even more of a re-boot than Casino. There is a grasp in this one to make this Bond the definitive Bond. The Bond. An attempt to sweep away all earlier versions, while still giving a nod to them, and actually make this 007 James Bond. I can't be more explicit than that without giving spoilers, but I just want to say that I wasn't entirely happy with this aspect of the movie in relation to the other Bond movies. Casino did a fine job of updating the franchise and setting up a new sequence of movies. There was no need to go even further back and attempt to shove all the other movies aside.

5036336,4,B006X040NY,"A solid return to form for the Bond franchise after a bit of instability in Quantum of Solace. Daniel Craig is still growing into the leading role, but he's begun to mix in little quirks and kinks to his performance that, taken together, make a big difference. The action sets, also, seem to be past their growing pains and strike a nice balance between the stark, modern realism of the two preceding pictures and the characteristic over-the-top absurdity of past chapters. Like its predecessors Skyfall struggles with pacing issues, dilly-dallying for most of the first act, but once Javier Bardem finally surfaces around the sixty-minute mark it gets to the point and presses pedal to metal the rest of the way. It's interesting that, while in previous films the villains have been momentary flashes of color meant to shine a brighter light on the hero, Bardem's role in Skyfall often actually eclipses that of Bond himself. He's a brilliant, charismatic, damaged bit of anarchy that's reminiscent of, if not quite as eccentric as, Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker, and Bardem is magnificently unnerving in the role. With the spirited new foil, the return of a few familiar monikers to the series and a dramatic, meaningful finale that's sure to reverberate through subsequent installments, I think it's safe to say James Bond is finally, firmly back in the saddle.",1359331200,,1367,4.973799126637554
5036337,5,B006X040NY,"I am among those who have seen all the Bond movies.  I am old enough to have seen Goldfinger in a first run theater, an experience I will never forget.  For the longest time, I thought Goldfinger was the best Bond movie.  The Aston Martin, Jill Masterson (the golden girl), Oddjob, Pussy Galore, and one of the best movie theme songs of all time--lightning captured in a bottle.  For those of you too young to appreciate it, there were two actors working in the 60s who defined ""cool"", and Sean Connery as James Bond was one of them.
Now, there is Skyfall, which I believe is the best of the Daniel Craig as Bond movies.  Great song (will Adele ever make a mistake?), tight script, thoughtful direction, and they brought the Aston Martin back.  Others have said it better than I, but this is a good movie, not just a good Bond movie.  That said, if you watched Goldfinger and Skyfall back to back, you would see that Goldfinger and Oddjob are comic book villains, and you would know, just as I knew when I first saw it, that Bond would figure out how to stop the atom bomb from going off.  No real villains, and no real suspense.  Is it still fun to watch?  You betcha.  Every time.  It's that combination of things that simply work without wearing out.
Is Skyfall better?  Well, it's different in tone, much more sophisticated in style, and vastly superior in the technical sense.  I'm giving it 5 stars because ""I loved it.""  But when I watched the two of them, I came away thinking how it's harder to be original, it's harder to be cool, and it's harder to capture lighting nowadays.

  James Bond (played by Daniel Craig for the third time) and fellow MI6 agent Eve (played by Naomie Harris) have tracked a thief carrying a stolen hard drive with confidential information to a train. After an exhausting chase and an epic amount of destruction, Bond and the thief are locked in a physical struggle. With the thief in her sights, Eve (Harris), on orders from M (played by Judi Dench for the seventh time) takes the shot, misses, and sends 007 plummeting to the water below while the hard drive and the thief are lost. M (Dench) is summoned before a government committee where one member, Gareth Mallory (played by Ralph Fiennes), encourages her to retire. While en route to MI6 headquarters, their servers are breached and, while M watches helplessly in traffic, their offices are destroyed killing several agents. Bond, having taken his fall from the tracks as an opportunity to retire, learns of the attack while watching television in a bar. His return to government service is typically atypical. He breaks into M's home, reports for duty, and asks how he can be of service. Before returning to duty, Bond must submit to both a physical and a psychological exam. Despite failing both, a desperate M puts Bond back in the field, for lack of a better idea.

  This being a Bond movie, there is, of course, a great deal more to the story. The moment we are introduced to the true villain, Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem) marks the Bond series' return to cinematic greatness. Bardem is truly terrifying and every time you think you've figured out his master plan, he shocks you. The introduction of Ben Whishaw as 007's liaison to Q branch breathes new life into an element of the franchise that I assumed had simply been abandoned with the departure of Pierce Brosnan and the death of the much-beloved Desmond Llewelyn.

5036344,4,B006X040NY,"Skyfall marks the Bond franchise's 50th year and 23rd film in that time. For those familiar with the franchise, it is not rare to see the world of Bond tweaked, updated, modernized, and ""freshened up."" Skyfall is a very different Bond film, in that regard. It seems director, Sam Mendes goes out of his way to saturate his film with thematic trappings that chastise the egoism of youth and praise the wisdom of age. This is an intriguing direction to take, but it does slightly miss the mark.

In Skyfall, Daniel Craig reprises the legendary role for his third time. After a tragic mishap in Turkey, Bond finds himself off the grid and at a crossroads. A surprise attack on MI 6 forces his hand to once again enter the fray of espionage where he is met with doubt and reservation both by M (Judi Dench) and newly appointed Chairman of Intelligence, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). It seems the world of espionage has become a digital one and the artistry of the field operative is becoming superfluous. Nonetheless, Bond is reassigned to active duty to track down an ex-operative and cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem), fueled by revenge against those in the British government whom he believes betrayed him.

The Bond films that rest on a revenge storyline are historically some of the weakest entries in the history of Bond, and this one fits nicely in that group as perhaps the best of the weak. The action starts strong in classic Bond style, as 007 chases down a terrorist with a hard drive that contains all of the identities of undercover agents throughout the world. Bond and M's relationship is explored in Skyfall in much more depth than ever before, and this film does advance the mythology of Bond a bit more than some other previous entries. However, the film does hit a snag as Bond goes through the motions of tracking down leads throughout China. It is in China where Bond delivers his line, ""Bond, James Bond,"" and it is also where he drinks a Heineken (Heineken reportedly paid $45 million dollars to have Bond sip their brew in Skyfall). Furthermore, the climax, which does reveal the film's namesake, also feels a bit clunky and hokey. While Bardem's villain, Silva does provide some memorable scenes, he is simply a melodramatic excuse to allow Bond to remind us not to underestimate the power of some spit and elbow grease. Silva is, instead, a missed opportunity to chew the scenery along side some of the best Bond villains.

Skyfall is not a bad Bond movie, and it is certainly not a bad movie. Sam Mendes accomplishes his goal of creating a heavy-handed thematically driven exploration of Bond's inner workings. This is by no means a bad idea. However, this deviation from expectations is not executed with precision and allows the film to flounder in parts. There are some sequences that are absolutely heart pounding and the film leaves us eager to see what's next; just don't expect to see your Heineken investment pay off just yet. B-

the acting is superb! that is true!
but the story is but many mallion miles way too far off the real source it comes from! when in the world did james bond need any help from an old couple, or when did bond needed to booby trap a house to stop the bad guys being helped by two persons?
that is absurd!

and the lack of gadgets is truly dissapointing! this film has been praised by everyone out there, but have they not seen the classic bond films. one of themany aspects i love from the bond franchise is the absolutely impossible things bond performs with his gadgets. thats part of the bond joy when u go to the cinema and uknow what u will be getting!

but skyfall lacks of gadgets and of those remarkable impossible stunts we all miss!

it it boring too much talking, way too little action.
people who look at this new take on the bond films should stop copying the bourne franchise tone, and attach to the old formula bond that made the bond franchise rose in time. they should even take alook at mission impossible, it hasnot lose its essence. u know what u will get when u go to a mission impossible movie, and they still deliver.
but bond anniversary is like a continuation of quamtum of solace dissapointment, only with the exception that the story is in relatively terms good and great on the acting side.
but we the viewers and fans, we need to get back the old bond,the old joy, the old gadgets, the old stunts.

5036352,3,B006X040NY,"""Skyfall"" is a good movie with Daniel Craig doing another convincing rendition of the superspy for the 21st century. But it is overrated. It is a film enthralling to follow precisely and only because of its technical brilliance, the sheer speed with which the episodes move in this film to its climax. Bond's ""fall"" from the train,  in that wonderful preview shown all over the world, is an example of how brilliantly conceived some of the marketing campaigns in movies have become, and how one impressive stunt can cast a ""halo"" on the perception of the rest of the film. There are more action stunts like this dispersed through the film from Bond's exploits high atop state of the art skyscrapers in China to great action sequences staged on the streets of London and the great mystical landscapes of Scotland, that rival the special effects and stunts of great action film franchises from The Jason Bourne series to the Mission Impossible films.

Daniel Craig has brought to James Bond the kinetic efficiency of the 21st century action hero. His movements have the snap and stiffness that fits well with the new cinematic aesthetic of the digital age. Craig has created a slimmer, more agile spy, efficient in the conduct of his business but deficient in the charm and allure that made Bond the Brand that made the movie franchise. The steely gaze of Daniel Craig, his quick lithe movements, gives his Bond an economy of expression and austere efficiency in the tradition of Eastwood's Dirty Harry and Schwarzenegger's Terminator though it strips off the soul of the classic charm that Sean Connery brought into this franchise in the early 1960s.

The Bond brand continues to be re-defined in ""Skyfall"". From a purely economic point-of-view this re-branded Bond may last another fifty years. But as surely as the newly branded Bond has been fitted for the times it is certain that the allure of James Bond that fed the franchise for the first forty years has suffered a premature decline at 50.

The James Bond that Sean Connery created for screen had a playful toughness taking complete delight in the seductive style, charm, and elegance of 007's exotic dream like existence. This philosophy of style is of course a product of the age of the cold war years but it also has a universal charm to it that ought to be used and adapted to our very different age in the new century. Mr Craig's predecessor, Pierce Brosnan creatively adapted Connery's toughness, the Scot's inimitable charm, and the ""lighter"" more self-deprecating style of Sir Roger Moore to bring his own distinctive brand of charm to the franchise.

The charm and mystery of Bond ought to remain untouched because therein lies the source of its cultural staying power. We all know about the great tribute to Bond movies that the Austin Powers comedy franchise is. Its distinctive contribution is its slapstick comedy, its hilarious satire of the unique world of Bond. The deeper distinction of this form of satire is the underlying discerning commentary on Bond's charm - the fact of the character's mystery. Satire is often disguised admiration and Austin Powers is effective because it is born of this admiration of the central fact of the Bond universe - its invincible charm.

Daniel Craig's interpretation of Bond jettisons charm and tradition.  Bond has become a shell of a man, set out to do his job as an automaton. Admirers of Craig, from Sir Sean to Sir Roger, see this new beginning as a virtue. But a new Bond for the new century appears innovative and even possible only as an idea. A ""new Bond"" is an oxymoron since it just does not work on screen. At least this viewer continues to look back to Connery's Bond with nostalgia.

I like Daniel Craig in the Bond movies not because he is Bond, but because he is Daniel Craig. Craig is consistently compelling on the screen. He brings a raw energy and believability to his roles. But Bond is a mythic figure that does not mix well with the Craig persona. Unless of course Bond is adapted to fit the Craig persona. Real innovation in re-interpreting Bond could not begin with a clean break from the past. That sort of innovation is a destructive rather than a creative act. Reinterpreting an iconic figure like Bond requires a careful continuation of tradition, especially when so much good has come out of that tradition.

It is an interesting irony to me to see how Daniel Craig's philosophy of style is more easily traced back to one of the great nemeses of Bond films, the great Robert Shaw character, Red Grant, in From Russia with Love. It as if Red Grant's intense robotic screen presence and style triumphed metaphorically over Bond's fluid style. That fantastic fight scene in the train when he is on the brink of pounding Bond to bits ultimately ends with Grant pushed overboard. But he seems to have got the better of our hero in the long run by re-surfacing a half a century later to take over the Bond franchise in Casino Royale, Quantam of Solace, and Skyfall.

While this bit may be a bit overstated here the point of this illustration is that there is a certain coldness to Mr. Craig as Bond that reminds me of the more expressionless character of Grant's type in that early film. It is this emotional vacuousness of Craig as Bond that seems to me the tragedy of the new Bond for the new century. After every Bond movie, featuring Craig, I feel that we have lost that cultural institution for good, its allure, the special mood, of the traditional Bond film. Even the wonderful pounding John Barry Bond score has been modified or diluted to an unrecognizable form and left behind along with the great elegance of the previous Bond in the dust of the last century. This British Terminator as the new stand-in for Bond seems terribly inadequate.

Aspects of ""Skyfall"" that hold up beautifully to the tradition of Bond films is Adele's song ""Skyfall"" and Ralph Fiennes's superb turn as Gareth Mallory, a key aide to ""M"". The song is intoxicating and will almost certainly be the high point of the ""style"" of the film and will continue to be the ""selling point"" for the film in the long run. The eccentric bad guy, Silva,  played by another competent actor Javier Bardem, makes for a story that is not as enthralling as it has been made out to be. Dame Judy Dench has hardly performed badly in front of a camera or on stage. As ""M"" she continues to be interesting as ever. But the human dimension that Mr. Mendes, the director, attempts to inject into the script, by making ""M"" the target of Silva's wrath, only succeeds in deflating the mystery of ""M"".

Not all the action in the world can prop up a Bond film without a Bond who exudes the magic of the character conceived by Ian Fleming. One usually got that style in a couple of gestures from Sir Sean at his prime, in a few minutes of light-hearted wisecracks and banter in the inimitable elegance of Sir Roger, and in the dramatic intensity and laid back ease of Dalton and Brosnan. But in three films with Daniel Craig we see the new action star of the 21st century in place of the mythic character. Craig is an eminently watchable actor, a superlative action star, but his style is not in keeping with the spirit of this great mythic character. This franchise is alive and well; its financial success, supreme as it is, is no sign however that the Bond we know and admire is alive and well.",1358812800,25,7386,4.6679477325134515
5036353,4,B006X040NY,"James Bond devotees will get their fix in this excitingly sculpted story that takes 007 to a new level. Following the shenanigans of James Bond movies has as part of its reward the opportunity to see some of Britain's finest actors with a smattering of other countries polished veterans as well. The usual Bond formula - absurdly impossible chases and fights, scenic splendor form around the globe, beautiful women in daring roles, and the blur between justice and revenge  - are all present.

When James Bond (Daniel Craig, buff and strong as usual) mismanages his latest assignment in Turkey etc - the unsuccessful chase of Patrice (Ola Rapace) despite the very fine support of agent Eve (Naomie Harris) and the sidetrack of Svrine (Brnice Marlohe), Britain's agents around the world are exposed and MI6 is attacked forcing M (Judi Dench) to relocate the agency. These events cause her authority and position to be challenged by Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), the new Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee. With MI6 now compromised from both inside and out, M is left with one ally she can trust: Bond. With the aid of MI6 computer geek Q (Ben Wishaw) 007 takes to the shadows aided only by Eve and follows a bizarre set of clues to the secret island where the slimy Silva (a blond wigged Javier Bardem) is plotting his lethal and hidden motives that have yet to reveal themselves in the very place where Bond began - Skyfall, his Scottish home still managed by his old friend Kincade (Albert Finney). In perhaps the most spectacular (and loud) pyrotechnical exhibition of the Bond 23 films to date (more to come, we discover), the film simmers to an end.

Sam Mendes directs this very long but tensely exciting global travelogue of violence and Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan pepper the script with enough humor and clever lines to keep the audience entertained on a more cerebral level. The cast is uniform strong, with Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, and Judi Dench in full control of their lead responsibilities and supported by the fine acting of Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Wishaw in the smaller roles.  If you love James Bond You'll love this. Most critics are saying it is the finest of the Bond series...so where does it go from here? Grady Harp, January 13",1358812800,2,2314,4.821158690176323
5036354,5,B006X040NY,"Oh, how James Bond has changed over the years from the suave and debonair Sean Connery to the unflappability of Roger Moore to the poignant subtlety of Pierce Brosnan to the quantum of solace exhibited by my very favorite of the Bond actors--Daniel Craig. His Bond is absolutely fearless--and we find out why in ""Skyfall,"" the latest in the wildly successful Bond series of hit movies!

Skyfall--such an intriguing title, but what does it mean? Little Chicken shrieking about a falling sky but done metaphorically, of course? That's a good assumption, but not it. When the word, Skyfall, does appear on screen, it comes as a revelation. Skyfall, I actually said aloud. Skyfall. Of course.

But I get ahead of myself. The opening scene defies the meaning of the word danger in movie history. How is it possible for two men to fight and jump and fall in such a location as the rooftops of the cars in a speeding train? But they do, only to see Bond fall into the opening movie credits and what I consider the best of the Bond title songs, which is co-created and sung by Adelle.

The villain this time is Javier Bardem, an actor so talented that he can equally be convincing as horrific villains and an impossibly romantic lead (""Pray, Eat, Love""). He's a British agent, too, or was until the huge charge of power becomes a siren he cannot resist. More potent than power is vengeance and rightly so, in this case. He becomes corrupt and powerful and very destructive and vengeful, one of the most ominously dangerous of England's enemies in the Bond series.

The show-down between Bond and Bardem has many flaws, but that's OK, it's a movie and those flaws can be ignored and forgiven. However, the big news is that three new actors are introduced into the story line, each taking the place of important character fixtures. The viewer will say, Oh my, with each new revelation and yet be pleased at how each is introduced. Yeah, I'm being vague--don't want to give any spoilers.

So, that's my review. I'm skipping plot details because others before me beautifully presented those. My point is to highlight the changes and emphasize Daniel Craig as THE new Bond (yes, this is his third film as Bond, but this film establishes Craig as enduring and absolute).",1358812800,2,2256,4.70126582278481
5036355,2,B006X040NY,"""Skyfall,"" the latest entry of the 007 franchise, takes itself so seriously, trying to give some depth to the James Bond character. This time Daniel Craig's MI6 agent, who looks (intentionally) much older than before, is allowed to go back to his roots. Obviously this is a 007 movie envisioned by Sam Mendes, director of ""Road to Perdition"" (where Daniel Craig was seen). Perhaps Mendes, Craig and producer Barbara Broccoli thought it would be a nice idea for the long-running series to feature Bond (and ""M"" for that matter) with a past.

Nice, had they given us a range of gadgets, a so-called Bond girl and a good (and often outrageous) story only a Bond movie can tell. What you get instead is a technically superb but ultimately dull action movie cobbled together from set-pieces of other better action flicks. Even the much praised opening 15 minutes, the best part of the movie set in Istanbul, makes us feel ""I have seen this before.""

Probably you did. Plus, the screenplay has so many lapses of logic that, when Javier Bardem's character ""Silva"" finally reveals the true motive for what he has been doing, I thought it was a bad joke. I didn't find his half-comical mannerism and aging make-up impressive, but what is really disappointing is his dead seriousness that is totally out of place in this franchise, making Gert Frobe's villain ""Goldfinger"" look more convincing.

After all, much anticipated installment ""Skyfall"" suffers from its approach to the subject matter. A James Bond movie should be fun, something directors like Martin Campbell know much better.",1358726400,2,1577,4.943396226415095

She had him shot (accidentally) then when she discovers he's alive, then she acts like she could care less and says ""By the way, we had your apartment and belongs sold"" nonchalantly . What? Come on, please act a little bit surprised when someone you thought dead was actually alive, and Oh, by your hand non-the-less. This has nothing to do acting, Judi Dench did what she could with what she was given, the plot is gaping in this film, its not very good. Think about it, James Bond is a harden veteran spy who killed many people in her Majesty's secret service, why would he feel empathy for this person? M has done nothing really favorable, all she done is be a s***ty boss. Certainly he has killed for less than what M has done, I'm not saying that Daniel Craig's character should have killed M, but why would his eyes swell up and feel grief when she dies? In Casino Royale or maybe it was Quantum of Solace, he takes a friend after he gets killed and throws his corpse into garbage container because he needs to buy time in escaping (a friend that Bond has known for years) there is a reason why he does this, he needs time to escape his pursuers. In Skyfall there shouldn't be a reason for Bond to feel anything for M, its out of character, Bond is a cold and calculating person, James Bond is person who thinks fast on his feet, of high intellect. In Casino Royale, one could understand the grief he had for Vesper and what lead to the reasons to what he did in Quantum of Solace, There should be no emotion felt for M, why would he, she's not a likable person, I don't like her, fans don't like her, why would Bond? I would have thrown that worthless gift she gave him in the trash at the end of the movie. Skyfall is a hit and miss, in a believable world of James Bond he would care nothing for Judi Dench's character in Skyfall, in Casino and Quantum I thought she was just OK, nothing special and I loved these two movies. This movie's not a complete bomb, it's just merely OK. In my opinion I think Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever. Casino was a complicate film that worked, Skyfall is a overly done film that doesn't work, even Javier Bardem character Silva, to me, is forgettable, he's got the intellect to take an island city, why is it so complicated for this villain to find out where M lives and simple pay her a visit? Why rush into a Congressional Hearing an try to assassinate her in front of God and Country? Parliament (or what ever this building is) is heavy protected I would think. Nobody would be that stupid, chances of being caught are high, and what flunky would follow him, not professional ex military, idiots, yes, but a villain like Silva is not going to surround himself with dummies. I'm just saying a lot of this movie doesn't make since to me. One more thing, this movie could have used more semi nudity from the female actors (not Dench) and less semi nudity from Craig. Pierce Brosnan should have stared in this movie.",1358294400,3,2996,4.342245989304812

5036366,3,B006X040NY,"I have to agree with the comment that Dalton may have been the most underrated Bond ever. Much darker and closer to Flemming's agent. Casino Royale was interesting and Craig was brilliant but the two obvious flaws, (The steering wheel on the wrong side of the car and that Bond played Baccarat, not poker) were obvious and laughable. When comparing Craig, Connery, Lazenby and Dalton, it's hard to pick the best. (Moore and Brosnon were just silly). Craig, Dalton and Connery are obviously the best actors of the bunch but in Skyfall, Craig does his best with an incredibly hard to believe script. I especially am sorry they had to kill off Judi Dench. She brought a whole new flavor to the series.

Despite the incredible poor reviews of ""Quantum of Solace"" I have to say it holds up to multiple viewings better than Skyfall.

5036367,2,B006X040NY,"The James Bond franchise has once again proved itself to be a tired and cliched one. This edition proves it in spades. One of the few things that has been interesting in James bond flicks, action-wise, are the lengthy opening sequences. With ""You Only Live twice"" (1967) we had the astronaut-space-walk scene. With ""Moonraker"" (1979) we had the freefall-from-small-plane sequence. With ""Golden Eye"" (1995) we had the bungee-jump-off-damn sequence. With ""Skyfall"" (2012) we have the suited-man-on-motorcycle-on-rooftop sequence. And  Etc etc. And that's the best part, visually. Not bad but still Yawn.

Incidentally, RoverGuy Ben and Jason Scott Whetzel gave reviews (one star) that say a lot here...

As for story, this edition doesn't really have one to be worthy of an adventure. Pissed-off Javier Bardem wants to off M (a pale and boring Judi Dench) while a nostalgic Daniel Craig wants to save her ass. It doesn't work. This 'resurrection' of Bond never will. All of the characters look like death warmed over. Performances are wooden and repetitious. Add to this the other constant grating fact of so many James Bond films: bad sound editing. Is it only me or is it just inept soundtracks: Bond films are great on dramatic musical affects but horrendously bad on dialogue presentation. I strain to hear the over-done Brit accents which are strangely whispered or mumbled to the enormous chagrin of our ears, only to be bombarded with loud bursts of action-sound bites. Is it too much to ask that producers of these flicks might pay attention to character conversations and actually let us hear what is being said? Do we need our eardrums inflamed by highly overdone soundtracks in those action sequences? But I suppose it doesn't matter. James bond the character is as shallow as they come these days.

5036368,5,B006X040NY,"SkyFall - What makes Bond tick? Some call this the best Bond of all time. Is he just the mindless tool of the British goverment killing mad men who want to take over the world or does he have thoughts and feelings? During the last and most forgettable James Bond movie of the 20+ series, Quantum of Solace, some four years ago, there was a writers strike. The movie was half in production. So rather than stop the movie, non-union non-guild writers finished the plot about hoarding water and it was awful. The producers and people behind the series wanted to do a much better job this time they made a real plot with real character development. Imagine, instead of the usual two dimensional good guys and bad guys, James Bond as a real complex person with realistic motivation. and Judy Dench as ""M"" well motivated also. Will she sacrifice an MI-6 agent to stop a killer? Daniel Craig as Bond might make viewers forget Sean Connery.

Androgenous bad guy Javier Bardem has a grudge and blows up MI-6 main building in London! ( Her Majesties Secret Service - the English equivalent of the CIA). The Bond series has always been shot in exotic locations. This was shot in China and Turkey but it also has for the first time London and the bleak austere moody Scottish Highlands, which for some odd reason were never in James Bond movies before! There is also a great scene of Bond jumping into the non-destroyed portion of a moving train!

 Geniunely funny in places, even pokes fun at other James Bond movies. There is a new ""Q"" section with a new, very young Q who eschews most gadgets!

 the best Bond of all time? That honor might go to ""Goldfinger"" or ""From Russia with Love"", but this is certainly the most detailed and complex of the series and one of the best and should not be missed. If you think the Bond series is mindless action movies you are in for a pleasant surprise.

Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond so far, even if I did think Quantum of Solace was terrible.  Casino Royale and now Skyfall will surely cement him as one of the best Bonds.
What I like about Daniel Craig is that he, or maybe the Director, isn't afraid to show Bond's human side.  His weaknesses and flaws.  James Bond is a highly trained and very talented operative, but he has a disdain for authority and comes from a troubled past.
Javier Bardem plays my favorite villain in all of the James Bond movies.  most Bond villains are cheesy, but Bardems villain is actually scary.
Ralph Fiennes character is a bit of a surprise(in the direction his character takes through the movie), but surprising in a good way.
All in all, I would highly recommend this movie not only to James Bond fans, but to anyone who enjoys a good movie.

5036375,3,B006X040NY,"2012 was really quite a thrilling year for moviegoers, one of the most interesting in a long time. The Hobbit, Amazing Spider-Man, Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, and ... Skyfall, marking the 50th anniversary of James Bond, a historic marking in film history.
Despite being that old, the character never lost any of its appeal - remarkable when you consider that the series was in production almost continuously for five decades. Many tried to explain the magic of 007, but in the end, my point of view is this: movie magic is like love. If you can explain love, it's not love.

Skyfall, like the two previous Craig outings, firmly positions Bond in the year 2012. But this time, it harkens back to his past, his childhood. So, while the plot itself doesn't use prominent source material, the film extensively explores the character's past as written by Ian Fleming.
You could rightfully say that the plot plays almost second fiddle to Bond's personal characterisation, the confrontation with his age and his relationship to M. This gives Daniel Craig a vast playing field to portray James Bond like he never was before, a fully fledged dramatic character. Indeed, what you will most likely take with you from this film is the acting and character scenes by Craig, Dench, Bardem and Fiennes.
However, this is where the good news probably end.

With all the hype, and reviews calling this the best Bond film since Goldfinger, I rarely left a theater so dissapointed.
You know, ever since Casino Royale, and even in the Brosnan era, we were confronted with always the same tagline: Break out from the formula!

With every new Bond movie, it appears like the producers say there will be something special. However, if you announce something special 10 times in a row, it's not that special anymore. And that is a trap the guardians of the Bond heritage should not fall into: replacing one formula with another.
When was the last time James Bond was sent on a regular, straightforward mission until the end? Well? That was precisely 17 years ago: GoldenEye.
That was the only movie that did not feature ""specialties"" such as ""Stockholm Syndrome"", Bond ""going rogue"" or Bond falling in love ""for real"" or Bond being constantly at odds with M.
The quintessential mistake the Bond producers made (and make) is their thinking that the formula didn't work anymore because of the lukewarm reception of the later Brosnans. It wasn't the formula that was wrong with these films - they were just averagely produced action films with average scripts.

That mistake was mended when Craig took over, and still they feel like they can't just send Bond on a regular mission without detours or psychological WMD.
The motto of these films may be ""away from the formula"" and ""more realistic"", and still there is that nagging feeling deep inside that says been there, done that. When Bond feels betrayed by M, when the villain hints at being Bond's darker side ...

But fine, these are deeper flaws, let's assume it's a given, and you are not bothered by it. Then Skyfall still has many flaws.
First and foremost, the plot. It was almost a miracle that the same guys who ""wrote"" Die Another Day also contributed to the Craig scripts. This time, however, Purvis and Wade let their Die Another Day mindset shine through.
Skyfall focuses on Bond being too old and failing his test, even though Quantum of Solace showed a Bond who just received his 00-status. Makes no sense. Even less sense makes the fact that even though focusing on a list of all undercover agents worldwide for more than an hour, leading even to M's retirement, it disappears in a magic cloud of smoke, never to be mentioned again.
Silva's scheme to kill M relies on so many coincidences that it even insults the term ""deus ex machina"".

He gets captured. Deliberately. Then he escapes, also planned (let's forget for a minute that his escape seems to rely on the assumption that MI6 would hire exactly the guy who invented Silva's choice software for encryption), and I ask myself why he wants to get captured in the first place; apparently, to see M. But since he seems to know out of nowhere where and when she will have a semi-public hearing (that coincidentally happens when he gets captured), why would he bother?
Indeed, I have come to accept many impossibilities in Bond movies - they simply belong in there.

But: we see Bond being shot twice, once hitting organs (as hinted at later), falling 500 meters to his demise, drowning on top of that. 10 minutes later, we see him banging a woman on some beach, conveniently focusing on the wound at his shoulder and forgetting the one that seems to have punctured his liver, and back in action. Gloss over much?
I have an easier time believing Jaws could have actually survived the freefall in Moonraker.
Then Berenice Marlohe's character. She's introduced in utterly brilliant scenes in Macau and Shanghai, making you believe she could be the best Bond girl since Natalya in GoldenEye. And then? Killed in the very next scene. What an awful waste.
Being a film music fan, Thomas Newman's score remains dull and generic, without the faintest memorable thematic wisper or hint at Bondian romanticism, strings chopping away every 30 seconds in an attempt (!) to generate thrill - the most forgettable Bond score since the original Dr. No score by Monty Norman.

Other things dragging the film down: an opening titles montage that feels like you are being sucked into an animated Tim Burton film, a finale on a graveyard that feels like a Tim Burton set, unintentional comedy when Bond plays ""Bond Home Alone"" at his family lodge, complete with exploding floorboards. And a dangerous reminder of better days when Bond drives M to safety in the old Aston Martin DB5, seemingly parked randomly in the city because we don't have enough hommages to freaking Goldfinger piled up, the last significant one was only in the very last movie!
Speaking of continuity, at the finale, a weeping Bond holds M in his arms and kisses her forehead. Really. An emotional Bond is one thing, a wimp another. This isn't the same man who threw Mathis' body into a garbage can in Quantum.
At some point I was praying that Bond's housekeeper wouldn't lead M to Bond's room and show baby pictures or a photo of his parents dancing in falling leaves.

Skyfall is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it surely isn't the revelation people are making it out to be.
We have now spent *three* entire movies to set up James Bond as we know him! For Christ's sake, enough with the Stockholm syndromes, the psychoanalysis of Bond's mind, the mother complexes and the broken hearts! After 10 years of this stuff, one is longing for a bloody Roger Moore escapist adventure.
It's time Bond walks right into the office to learn his mission again. That doesn't mean the movies can't be down to earth as they are now, and Bond sticking to Fleming's characterisation, but Bond being personally involved in everything for 15 years now is tiring beyond belief. Connery's films never needed that heavy stuff despite not resorting to pure comedy.
Despite contrary statements, the feel of the Connery films was never reproduced. Don't be fooled into believing it isn't possible.

Perhaps the Broccolis should actually watch Goldfinger to search for something else than the possibility to pay hommage to it.",1357430400,9,7374,4.790094339622642

5036379,5,B006X040NY,"My dad and I are action, espionage, and sci-fi fans...as far as action & espionage is concerned, it has been a long standing tradition of ours to go and check out each new Bond movie when they come out, a tradition that has been in effect since the time I was a kid, back when Roger Moore was still doing Bond movies and Timothy Dalton soon took over on a couple of films.  Since that time, we have only ever missed a couple of Bond movies in the theater.

We had gotten to see Casino Royale in the theater, which we both had agreed was pretty good...and we liked Daniel Craig as the new Bond.  We missed Quantum of Solace in the theater however, and while we both agreed that it was good, we didn't like it as well as Casino Royale, and definitely not as well as past Bond movies before it.  Upon seeing Skyfall however, both our faiths were renewed in Bond anew, and in Skyfall we both felt Daniel Craig put forth his best performance as Bond, even more so than Casino Royale we felt, which was pretty dang good itself.

Not only were the performances by Daniel Craig, Judy Dench, and the rest of the cast stirring and enjoyable to watch, but the action in this film also shined it's best out of all 3 of the new Bond films.  On top of that, it was good to see Bond's humor and his filanderings with women return...what would Bond be without those things?  Understandably, Casino Royale was the start of a whole new franchise of Bond films, and in his beginning these kinds of appetites did not quite exist...Casino Royale was more serious, as well it should have been, and Daniel Craig shined there, and now once the Bond most know and love has returned in Skyfall, Daniel Craig is no less brilliant.

This Bond film apparently is the highest grossing Bond film of all time according to an article I have read, and it doesn't surprise me because it is fantastic!  It is my favorite Bond film since Goldeneye...I felt that was Brosnan's best Bond film, and I really enjoyed the agent pitted against agent concept in that one, which is also probably a little bit of why I liked Skyfall too because in fact Bond is pitted against a rogue agent in this as well...who also, as it were, is completely insane...Javier Bardem plays this maddened rogue agent brilliantly too!

If you're a Bond fan or any kind of action/espionage fan at all...you NEED to watch this Bond movie!  It is simply awesome and quite enjoyable from start to finish...it's engaging enough that it won't even seem like the 143 minute length of the movie.

Taking this more character driven route could have been a terrible mistake, but they pull it off nicely and take care not to stint on the action.  The climactic showdown, however, doesn't completely work.  It is satisfying emotionally but is anticlimactic coming on the heels of much more spectacular action set pieces from earlier in the film.  I never did quite understand how Bond managed to survive the opening sequence.

I'm looking forward to the next one.  The final scenes of the film seems to be nudging the franchise back toward the Connery-era Bond.",1356998400,7,1207,4.677725118483412
5036384,4,B006X040NY,"Honestly, I went in expecting a slow, boring film. My co-workers USUALLY don't steer me wrong. I should have listened to their advice before going into the train wreck that is The Bourne Legacy. I was pleasantly surprised. While there wasn't quite as much action as I had anticipated, the film made up for it with witty and comic dialogue. There were several instances where the audience would burst into laughter and chuckle. The writers clearly put a lot of thought into appealing to non-Bond fans, which made this a somewhat easy watch. The cinematography in this film is phenomenal. Editing was pretty good, too. I loved the fight scene on the rooftop, where the fight is shot in just one angle, which is rare to find in modern action scenes.

There were a few things I didn't like about film. I wish we could've seen more of Javier Bardem's character. His character wasn't very fleshed out, either. Additionally, the final action sequence was a little disappointing. There were a lot of setups for this scene, and the payoffs happened so fast, it seemed silly with how much time was spent on them. Finally, the soundtrack was nothing to write home about, especially the title song.

In conclusion, I must say this is one of the better Bond films I've seen. This one really made me like Daniel Craig as James Bond, which is something I never thought I would say. Skyfall is a solid Bond film that fans and non-fans can appreciate and enjoy.",1356912000,,1444,4.658823529411765

5036387,1,B006X040NY,"My observations/opinions:
(Contains spoilers)

- The pre title sequence was the best part of the movie.
- The opening credits were overly dark, complete with grave stones and skulls. Say what? Please bring back the nude silhouettes, minus this new nonsense.
- Adele's theme song is decent, but not overly memorable.
- ""Q"" is now a nerd that looks about 15 years old.
- Bond's trademark charm seems to be completely absent these days.
- Miss Moneypenny is now a full blown field operative prior to taking to her desk, which seems a bit wacky. She was one of the better characters in the film though.
- So Bond gets a Walther PPK with a signature grip so only he can fire it. This was a cool concept... Back in 1989's License to Kill, where Bond had a custom rifle with a signature grip.
- The villain, portrayed by Javier Bardem (with bleached blonde hair) is just down right creepy and disturbing, and not in a ""good villain"" sort of way.
- The plot: A disgruntled former agent that feels betrayed and wants to expose undercover agents while exacting his revenge on ""M"". Not impressed.
- Ralph Fiennes fits in quite well, but I kept thinking ""how did the English Patient get in here?!""
- Reintroducing the Aston Martin DB5. Cool from a nostalgic POV, but makes no sense whatsoever, being that the whole franchise has supposedly been rebooted. Then why would he have the exact same car (complete with ejector seat and twin machine guns) from Goldfinger, circa 1964? For reference, Daniel Craig was 4 at the time. Then to make it even worse, let's destroy the car just because we can!
- For about 1/3 of the movie, Bond needs a shave and sports graying stubble. This succeeds in making him look considerably older than he should. More so when he's sharing the screen with the teenage Quartermaster, aka ""Q"".
- Bond's short crew-cut dissolves even more of his Bond look, and makes Daniel Craig's elf ears overly prominent.
- We get to visit Bond's childhood home! A dark and dreary estate on a moor in Scotland. The brilliant plan is to lead the bad guy(s) there for a climactic shootout, while enlisting the help of the gamekeeper. Always a great way to revisit the old homestead!
- The title Skyfall simply refers to the name of the aforementioned estate. And here I initially thought it might refer to some intriguing plot. Silly me!
- Bond's timing is completely off, which leads to the untimely death of a Bond Girl. Note to Bond: You're supposed to make your move before the girl dies, not directly after! And of course, this doesn't even slightly concern our robotic Bond.
- Poor ""M"". What a lousy thing to do to Judi Dench's character.
- Skyfail

In summary, I miss the Bond's of the past. I think this movie probably appeals more to viewers in their early 20's that haven't seen the majority of the previous films.

The franchise took a massive nose dive with Die Another Day (even Pierce Brosnan laughs about the absurdity of the movie). Things briefly recovered with Casino Royale, then the descent resumed with Quantum of Solace, and now Skyfall. In my opinion, they have made a mess with their reboot attempts. They seem to be trying too hard while making strange decisions in the process.

The movies are also coming across as exceedingly dark and Bond has very little charm these days. Having read most of the books, I think Timothy Dalton came closest to Ian Fleming's vision of James Bond.

If they are so determined to wipe the slate clean and start things from the beginning, then we need a younger Bond. They are replacing everyone else with younger actors, so pretty soon Bond will be the oldest member of MI6, and that is bound to be a bit awkward.

I won't hold my breath for the next installment. I may have to wait for the reboot of the franchise reboot, if that eventually happens. In the meantime, I'll pop in a DVD and enjoy one of my favorites, including For Your Eyes Only, The Living Daylights, Dr No, etc.",1356825600,40,3934,4.573049645390071
5036388,5,B006X040NY,"I am a die hard Sean-Connery-as-James-Bond fan. I like most of Roger's and a couple of Pierce's. I was not happy when I first learned of Daniel Craig as the new Bond. Daniel who? Was my first reaction. Not another Lazenby, I thought...
I like Casino Royale, but it took me a couple of watches on DVD for it to grow on me. I didn't hate Quantum of Solace as much as others seem to, but then I saw Skyfall..... I love this movie so much that not one day has gone by when I haven't thought of it at least once. I saw it twice in one week, and I never do that when movies are in theaters. The writers of this film must be brought back for the next one, yes it has some minor similarities to The Dark Knight movies, but so what.  I can not wait for the Blu Ray release. I hate to admit it, but this may just be my new favorite Bond movie. The only thing that would make it perfect for me would be if Connery were still young enough to play Bond. The opening sequence, the action, Javier as the creepy villain, the surprises in the end.. It's almost perfect. Bravo Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson.  Now do it again for Bond 24....

Oh...and did I mention the awesome theme song by Adele?? How perfect for the 50th year! Slightly reminiscent of Goldfinger theme, the Monty Norman 007 theme, very well done. Nobody does it better these days. Pun intended....",1356652800,271,1354,4.22007722007722
5036389,5,B006X040NY,"For those who did not know that the Daniel Craig James Bond films have been prequels to the Bond movies we all know and love, this movie will definitely prove that point! Of course, it stands that the entire trilogy (of the new installments) has been a reboot, but by the end of this film, we're placed in the spot that all of us Bond fans know of our favorite spy. I was worried about director Sam Mendes directing this film as he hasn't done any serious action-packed films. Fortunately, my fears were put to rest. This film has got all the action, a wonderful Bond song (provided by Adele), and a really good story that introduces the important Bond characters of the mythology. However, there is one small caveat here. Sometimes it is not good to be a cinephile and someone who's seen a s***load of movies. Because then, you can't help but notice storylines that get recycled. Case in point: this film. Don't get me wrong, the story is good, the dialogue great, the acting superb. BUT ... the overall plot is something we've seen before in the James Bond saga. Anyone recall&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GoldenEye/dp/B000M53GM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GoldenEye</a>, which starred Pierce Brosnan as Bond? Remember the villain Alec Trevelyan (played by a pre-""Lord of the Rings"" Sean Bean)? Well, Trevelyan is a fellow 00 agent who fakes his death and spends the film exacting revenge on MI6 for their involvement in his parents' death. Sounds vaguely familiar with this film's antagonist Raoul Silva (a.k.a. Tiago Rodriguez) (Javier Bardem), who exacts revenge on MI6 for ""betraying"" him. I had the same slight problem with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prometheus/dp/B005LAIHXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prometheus</a>; a great film but the story is the same overall story structure as the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-The-Director-s-Cut/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien (The Director's Cut)</a>.

On a different note, it's interesting that this film is a prequel and yet, it features Judi Dench as M, which carries over from ""GoldenEye"" (the film she was first inducted in to play M). It's like it went full-circle. So is this a prequel or just a continuation of the saga? Either way, it's an excellent story. Standouts in the film were Ben Whishaw as Q (YES!!!!) and Naomie Harris as Eve (who holds her own with Bond -- wink, wink). Overall, ""Skyfall"" is enjoyable, action-packed, Javier Bardem plays a great villain, and Craig's vulnerability was needed and well done. This is a definite must-see and one of the best Bond films ever!",1356652800,8,2711,5.59610705596107
5036390,5,B006X040NY,I saw this movie at the theater. It was the best bond movie I have seen. A lot of action. I wanted a copy of my own so I pre-order a Blu-Ray) disk  from amazon.com,1356566400,3,163,3.657142857142857
5036391,5,B006X040NY,"Having seen Skyfall more than once, I can say that it does get better with increased viewings.  Is it the greatest James Bond film of all time?  No.  Is it one of the better films in the series?  Yes.  Being more innovative and consistent in its vision, Casino Royale still inches out Skyfall as Daniel Craig's superior 007 outing, but the latest Bond effort certainly manages to breathe new life into a series that for years was just going through the motions.

Skyfall's greatest strength is the quality of its acting.  The cast is simply impeccable, and kudos must be given to Craig, who while giving his best in playing a burnt-out James Bond with a too-severe crewcut nonetheless is gracious enough to share the limelight with his co-stars.  Judi Dench is wonderfully irascible and vulnerable as M -- you'll feel the ground of her career shifting beneath her feet just as she does.  Special attention must be given to Berenice Lim Marlohe, who has much too little screen time as the very Fleming-esque Severine, Ben Whishaw, who could easily have come across as yet another smarmy jackass Hipster, and Ralph Fiennes, who once was rumored to be considered for the Bond role but is wonderfully stalwart and studious here as Mallory.  Naomie Harris is sexy yet sweet as Eve (you'll find out why), leaving only Javier Bardem's Raoul Silva as the weakest link -- hardly his fault because the part is underwritten.

In fact, the biggest problem with Skyfall revolves around how much you'll say ""I've seen this before.""  And I'm not just talking about following the Bond formula.  Skyfall seems to have taken most of its sensibility from The Dark Knight, to the point that too many elements are begged, borrowed, and stolen.  The most obvious is Silva himself, who is basically a redux of Heath Ledger's Joker, though not quite as magnetic.  Despite all the hype, he's no Goldfinger or Dr. No.  Luckily, an actor of Bardem's caliber finds a way to make him more interesting than he is written.  But it doesn't stop there.  A motorcycle chase through a Turkish bazaar will remind you of the mall scene from the other movie, and there are more than a few music cues from Thomas Newman's score (not counting Adele's predictably moody ballad) that will make you think Batman instead of James Bond.  Some moments, such as a jail sequence, will in addition evoke Silence of the Lambs, and the climax, essentially lifted from Straw Dogs, also finds a way to crib the second Star Trek movie, right down to camera shots.  Shoehorning in an older, world-weary Bond to service the plot also seems a bit too early for a series that only six years ago introduced us to the youthful precursor to the 007 we know.

What makes Skyfall work best, though, is that director Sam Mendes is as interested in the performances as he is in the formula.  In fact, the emotional fireworks are much more interesting than the action sequences, which seem surprisingly flat by comparison.  I've read that the original version of the film was much longer and am hoping that the deleted sequences will be returned in a director's cut, as I get the impression that additional character moments were sacrificed in favor of the set pieces.  That might explain why the only line Craig delivers poorly -- a bit about Scotch -- seems misplaced given the build up the rest of the movie provided and why the re-appearance of the Aston Martin DB5 seems inconsistent with Casino Royale.  There are also shots in the trailers for Skyfall that are obviously not in the film.  For casual fans of Bond, the character's complex family history might also be confusing.  The script as we have it does minimal effort to fill in the details and makes me wonder what else was sacrificed.  (Of course, a solution might have been to have Daniel Kleinman's so-so opening credits sequence focus less on forecasting what we'll see in the movie and more on Bond's personal history.)  My impression is that these missteps are less the result of intention on the part of the filmmakers and more the result of having to pare down a film to something more manageable for theaters.  While it can save a disastrous director's cut, editing can also often leave a fragmented artistic vision.

Ultimately, Skyfall brings us back to where it all started.  Given that the previous two films seem to have done the same thing, it is all getting a little tedious, but nonetheless Skyfall, for its limitations, is great entertainment and certainly the most visually stylish Bond we've seen in a long time.  The great Roger Deakins' cinematography is as usual beautiful and he has adjusted to digital cameras with panache.  I hope when I go to Shanghai in a few months it's as stunning as it appears in this film.  The same goes for the suits and costumes, and I'm glad to see that the fitted suit has finally returned with grandeur.  The Bond series is now firmly poised to legitimately pursue fitting into the sensibilities of the previous films of the series, and so long as the studios don't sit around with their thumbs up their posteriors for another four years, should portend an even better 007 film to come.  Skyfall returns Bond to the role of knight errant as opposed to angsty rebel but without losing the manly confidence that Craig brings to the role -- it's good to have you back, Mr. Bond.",1356566400,10,5329,4.7098166127292345

I like that",1356480000,2,312,4.491228070175438
5036393,3,B006X040NY,"Let me start off by saying: Skyfall is a good movie. However, it isn't the best Bond film of all time, and it isn't the pinnacle of action artistry that other sources are claiming. It's still worth a watch, even if I am being harsh here. It's just that Skyfall doesn't live up to its hype, even if it's good. Unfortunately, I can't do half-stars here, otherwise I'd give it 3.5/5.

The film starts off on a fantastic note with an eventful multi-tiered chase through Istanbul, including motorcycles on the rooftops and a true-to-Bond thriller format - and it barely even uses CGI as per director Sam Mendes's behest, which was one of his many great decisions. This proves to be by far the best sequence in the film, as its riveting presentation engrosses the viewer. The first issue, however, props up at this sequence's conclusion: A completely unnecessary suspense of belief that completely defies all logic and is never explained in the slightest capacity. When I see a movie, I at least expect the latter.

This is not a one-time issue at all. In fact, the recurring nature of these either unexplained or underwhelming facets is at fault of one thing: A poor script. Skyfall is, in essence, a fantastically produced film adapted from a lackluster script. That's a pretty large problem. You would think that Neal Purvis and Robert Wade would know what they're doing, since this is their fifth endeavor into the James Bond universe, but they clearly don't.

The first major issue with the script is the complete lack of character development where it is necessary. Raoul Silva, the main antagonist, is given a haphazardly-assembled plotline that is almost nonsensical; however, Javier Bardem's brilliance with what he is given makes Silva a standout in the series - at least superficially. His motive and actions are there, but are never fully explored. The script makes him a bitter psychopath and very little more - Bardem takes this and makes it into something else. There is also Eve (Naomie Harris), a field agent whose camaraderie with Bond is colorless and backstory is virtually nonexistent. Another example is the film's only Bond girl, Svrine (played by Brnice Lin Marlohe), who is brilliantly acted by taking inspiration from GoldenEye's Famke Janssen, but her development is never explored. Also, given that Svrine is the ONLY Bond girl, the script doesn't give something important that the Connery and Moore Bonds had: Charm. Daniel Craig is brilliant in the role of Bond, but he's not given the suaveness and seduction that the fans expect from Bond. He's given everything else he needs here, which is a plus, but it's his own execution that proves it. It's the writers that aren't keeping with the formula.

Another issue with the script is the uncreative action sequences that follow the initial Istanbul chase. The film's first act consists of a series of hand-to-hand brawls that get repetitive and predictable. The film's second act has a long footchase that only wishes it lived up to the greatness produced in the opening of 2006's Casino Royale. The film's climax is also drawn-out and straightforward, and halfway through the sequence, you ask yourself if the movie is going to end any time soon. This may be due to fatigue induced from the excessively long footchase paired with the continuing endlessness of a rather boring climax.

Yet another thing to note is the near nonexistence of the dry wit that helped make the Bond films of the past even more fun. There are very few laughs and there are very few double entendres. Thankfully, ""Bond. James Bond."" makes a reappearance after its unforgivable exclusion from 2008's Quantum of Solace. The script is an improvement from that disaster in every facet, which means it's a start at the very least.

To reiterate: Skyfall is a good movie. It's a fantastically-executed adaptation of a weak script. The acting, directing, and production all go above and beyond the norm, but the mediocre writing makes Skyfall devoid of some elements that made the 007 franchise a success in the first place. It's a huge step forward from the abysmal Quantum, but it isn't to the level of Casino Royale, which had everything Skyfall does PLUS memorable action sequences and the charming suaveness with the ladies that this entry lacks. It is those two missing elements that strip the soul from this Bond. This seems more Mission Impossible than Bond, and when you can't take a fifty-year-old franchise and keep its unique identity, then something more needs to be done. I know nothing can be perfect, and Skyfall isn't. It's just that with all the hype, I was expecting something more. However, I would recommend it to Bond fans, action film aficionados, and those looking for something new to explore. It's a good movie, but it comes nowhere near to beating Casino Royale or GoldenEye for the best post-Cold War Bond.",1356480000,14,4877,4.898305084745763

5036398,5,B006X040NY,"James Bond is sure getting up there in age. He's 59 years old since his birth in Ian Fleming's novel Casino Royal along with 50 years since his first film appearance in Dr. No, and his 21 other Bond films have taken a toll on the franchise and character with its ups and down. It might be time for Bond to retire and get his AARP card. I started watching Bond back in 1990 or 1991. I was just 11 or 12 years old when I caught a marathon of Bond films on what I remember being TBS and the first Bond film I saw was Goldfinger. I didn't understand all the sexual references or the adult humor at the time, but I loved the films and character, and they were really entertaining. My favorite Bond is Sean Connery. His first four film go at the character with Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball were just great. That's not to say he was perfect especially with his second and third go at the character. I think George Lazenby is looked over or unappreciated as James Bond. Roger Moore in the beginning did a really good job as James Bond, but quickly started showing his age after the disaster of a Bond film in Moonraker. Moore was followed by Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and now Daniel Craig as James Bond which comes back to the age thing. Through the years with different actors and different tone or takes on the character James Bond has gotten old. Some would say why continue the series the character is outdated with it being a different type of world and films like the Bourne series, Mission Impossible and others maybe it is time to retire the character and series. The funny thing is Skyfall addresses these issues and masterfully does it with poignant and humorous moments that address these issues.

I think I'll try and avoid plot details and instead talk about some of the themes of the film like for example intelligence agencies in the modern world. With countries not being a huge direct threat to nation security of nations with most being criminal organizations, militant groups or terrorist organizations intelligence agencies have to adapt and is an issue in this film dealing with MI6. Of course getting old and being in this line of work is another theme. What is a person like Bond going to do if he retires? I mean really is he just going to sit around somewhere leading a boring life. The man has lived an exciting with women, danger and adventure, but not without being majorly scarred from torture, injuries and losing friends and loved ones. M (Judi Dench) also has to face these realities as does the bad guy Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). The last issue is the abandonment and mommy issue which two of the main characters have. It doesn't sound like a Bond film does it? I'm sure some would say it goes against the Bond reality, but face it time, age and the sins we commit in life eventually catch up to us and it works in Skyfall making it one of the best Bond films. There are a few flaws in the film mainly I think to do with editing for time. I think Sam Mendes and the editors edited out a few things to save on time. I think you'll notice them like when Bond is relaxing on a beach somewhere. I won't give anything away except it's kind of really short and seems to have been edited. Also there's character Svrine (Brnice Lim Marlohe). The stunningly beautiful character/actress is underused and I think some of her scenes were edited out or shortened. These are just small flaws that I noticed, but nothing that would hurt the film for me or anyone else.

All right let me be honest what makes this film go are two actors and one actress in Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench, and really the film is about them. Daniel Craig with his performance as James Bond has become my second favorite Bond behind Sean Connery. I know people will point to Quantum of Solace saying how disappointing a film it was, but it wasn't. Was it perfect of course not, but it is not even close to being the worst Bond film. If you want those all you have to do is watch Moonraker, Never Say Never Again, Die Another Day and The World Is Not Enough. Quantum was middle of the pack Bond film and Daniel Craig did a great job. Judi Dench as M in GoldenEye from just being Bond's boss into a real character with obvious flaws and scars and true affection and respect for James and she truly shows it here in Skyfall. Then there is Javier Bardem who truly steals the film as the bad guy. I think this may be the most original villain in the Bond franchise though some might find some parallels with another Bond villain, but I won't tell you since that might give something away. Even with that said Javier does the far better job. He's been betrayed, abandoned, tortured and has been psychologically scarred. He isn't after world domination or something ridiculous like that he's after something more tangible. I might have to watch the Bond films again, but in my opinion Raoul Silva might be the best single Bond villain ever. Ralph Fiennes does a really good job in his role as Gareth Mallory, and I loved Ben Whishaw as the new Q. I look forward to seeing the character in future films. I've already talked about Brnice Lim Marlohe, so instead I'll talk briefly about Naomie Harris (Eve). She's not horrible nor is she greatly memorable. I ended up with a sort of indifference toward her and her character.

The more realistic action they've been putting in Bond films since Daniel Craig began as James Bond again really works. The opening sequence is really good and there's a short sequence at night in a skyscraper in Shanghai that is truly beautifully done. The cinematography was beautiful especially the scenes in Scotland. In the brief scenes they did an astounding job showing off the beauty of the country. Sam Mendes is a masterful job directing Skyfall and beginning together the story and actors almost perfectly. Now to be honest up until about nine months to a year ago I had never heard of Adele, and nor was I a big fan when I heard her music. That being said she did a really good job with the Bond theme song. It is kind of funny and interesting that Bond is the only franchise that does something like this and generally it works. The problem I had with Skyfall's one isn't the song it's the video that went with it. The video just wasn't very good at least to me. Outside of the Adele and the Bond theme the music was well done and worked for the film.

Is James Bond getting old or irrelevant? Yes maybe the Ian Fleming character he created in his novels, but not the James Bond you saw in Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. No James Bond has found a way to adapt and cope with the times yet still keep many of the qualities and beliefs that have made him a great character and in doing so he has for now become ageless. Skyfall is one of Bond's best films with a great story, great acting (especially by the three main characters), really good directing and cinematography. I highly recommend this film for Bond fans and action fans in general. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1356307200,10,7061,4.458623356535189
5036399,5,B006X040NY,"4.5 stars.  Making the 23rd James Bond movie is no enviable task.  Make it in the traditional way and it looks like retread and parody, like Brosnan's last two.  Depart from the traditional and it's not really a James Bond movie, like Quantum of Solace.  This is a series that has had to be remade several times to fit in with the era and to make Bond's exploits interesting.  Skyfall isn't so much a remake as it a back to basics.  Much of it has an old-school feel to it.  Q & Moneypenny are reintroduced and a new M is introduced.  The Bond villain isn't part of some absurd global criminal organization.  He's just a cackling madman From the Connery/Moore days played perfectly by Javier Bardem.  Bardem is the best Bond villain since Sean Bean in Goldeneye.  Craig's Bond isn't some tortured antihero.  He's a professional killer w a smart mouth.  The beauty of James Bond movies used to be how they were pure escapism.  Bond's psychology wasn't explored, much less considered.  He was more of a cypher through which the viewer could live his or her fantasies of jet-setting and saving the world.  The eternal sunshine of 007's spotless mind.  Skyfall edges closer to that.  We get some personal stuff but not nearly the tortured angst of the last two entries.  Skyfall runs well over two hours but doesn't feel too long like most movies do these days.  There's no Bond girl this time around and that is disappointing.  Bond movies tend to work best when there's an element of sexiness to them.  Some of the plot and action sequences are obviously borrowed from other movies like Batman and Die Hard.  Bond works best when he's setting the pace and not keeping up.  Other franchises should imitating Bond.  Judi Dench was always pressing for more screentime and here she gets to be the focus of the entire movie.  Fortunately, she is an excellent actress, so I didn't mind too much.  I like Craig as Bond.  He's a talented actor, so that gives the brain trust a flexibility most of his predecessors didn't.  I'm heartened by the changes they made.  Exactly the kick in the pants this often moribund franchise needed.  I'm looking forward to Bond 24.",1356307200,9,2154,4.63395225464191
5036400,5,B006X040NY,"All the accusations of the Bond franchise ripping off the Jason Bourne series are overblown.  If anything, this latest installment in Bond's new evolution takes the high art of murder to a beautiful new level.  The theme throughout is light and shadow, and the director makes excellent use of both to illustrate how death isn't dealt only in the shadows.

The other theme is old dogs in a world full of Internet-savvy young pups.  Whether it's M (Judi Dench) or Bond (Daniel Craig) himself, they recognize themselves as relics of a bygone era in which satellites and video cameras do most of the spy work for them.  And yet that's what makes Bond so important in this modern age -- he goes ""off the grid,"" where the real terror lurks.

Javier Bardem plays an embodiment of that terror, Raoul Silva, a brutally warped villain who has an understandable (if unreasonable) motive to kill M. Just as Bond has an unspoken duty to Queen and Country, the new world tests that loyalty by robbing first Bond -- then M, then the entire organization -- of its identity.  When politicians drag their doings into the light of day, the franchise feels invigorated because it's finally facing up to the ludicrous issues of the past.  Bond can no longer casually sip a martini without being reminded that he's drinking taxpayer's money.

And that's a good thing.  ""Skyfall"" works so well because it's not just another installment in the franchise, it's a milestone.  Things are changing for Bond, in a good way, and it gives me hope that we can expect more out of this old dog in a new world.",1356307200,52,1575,4.649819494584838
5036401,5,B006X040NY,"I've been very disappointed with the previous two ""007"" movies because of the lack of traditional humor and specific things that went into all of the previous 007 movies. (I've seen all of the ""007"" movies when they came out starting with Dr. No., and I have all of the DVD's, which replaced the VHS versions that I had as they became available.) I took my six-year old daughter to see the double billing of ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Dr. No."" She is now a grandmother of four.

Now the producers have seen fit to bring back the action theme music during 007's chases that I've heard for years, and I was unhappy that it was eliminated from the two previous Daniel Craig movies. (Spoiler) Additionally they brought ""Q"" back, with his magic tools and Miss Moneypenny. Hooray! Best of all, Adele sang a theme song filled with the sounds and emotions of the traditional Bond movies. It's more than likely to get an Oscar nod, as many of the previous opening them songs did.

The live action stunts that Bond movies are known for, were excellent, including an excellent plot and fine editing, which kept me on the edge of my seat. I was pleased that Bond still likes his drink ""shaken,"" even though it was eluded to very subtly and previously put down in ""Casino Royale.""

The only questions reamaining now that I'm satisfied with Craig, is are we getting another new ""Bond"" for the next movie, and will the theme music and classic ""007"" approach to the movies be used appropriately from now on?",1356220800,8,1493,4.563432835820896

5036405,4,B006X040NY,"Let's get one thing out of the way. ""Skyfall"" isn't the best Bond film ever.

I find people have a fondness in their heart for the James Bond they grew up with. If your immediate response to the question ""Who was the best Bond ever?"" isn't Sean Connery, it is most likely the actor who played the secret agent when you were growing up. I have a fondness for Roger Moore because he was the first actor I watched playing Bond long before video and downloading made all of the films available at the touch of a button. It wasn't until I was a little older and could catch them at a Repertory Movie Theater, the kind that showed a different double-bill every night - do they even still exist? - that I was able to see Connery in action. Connery is the penultimate, but Moore is my Bond. And all of this history affects how you view every film in the series.

For years, the producers and studio(s), have been claiming this Bond or that Bond would be a grittier, harder edged secret agent. Connery set the tone and made the role suave, debonair and a lady's man. But as time went on, the edge wore away until it was almost non-existent. The arc of Moore's films seems to have done the reverse. They started off tongue-in-cheek, become a little grittier and then crash-land back in Parody-ville with the unforgivable ""A View To A Kill"". Timothy Dalton was supposed to be the answer, but his two films are considered among the worst in the series. They are grittier, but they are also devoid of charm and fun. Pierce Brosnan was a welcome breath of fresh air and ""Goldeneye"" delivered on some of the promises of an evolution. But his films are pretty uneven (Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist?). So the promises of Daniel Craig's new grittier, harsher Bond were met with skepticism by many.

I'm sure someone, somewhere thinks Timothy Dalton is great. I have yet to find them, but that person must be out there somewhere.

That said, ""Skyfall"" is the best Bond film in a long, long time.

It seems like each actor takes one or two films to get their feet wet, to get accustomed to the character, to become comfortable enough to inhabit the role. Craig started the process with ""Casino Royale"", his first outing, which was very good, faltered a bit with ""Quantum of Solace"" and now returns. Three films in, Daniel Craig seems comfortable enough to both have fun and take a good hard look at his role and how he will define Bond. ""Skyfall"" stands head and shoulders above most because Craig explores some dark places, giving his portrayal a gravitas we haven't always seen. But he is also comfortable enough to give a wink - wink, nudge - nudge to the actors who have come before him. It is a little thrilling to watch an actor fully invested in his character, making it his own, giving depth and meaning to the role.

""Skyfall"" works so well in equal parts due to Craig, the film's director, Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"", ""The Road to Perdition"") and the writers, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (""Quantum of Siolace"", ""Casino Royale"", ""The World Is Not Enough"" and the upcoming big screen adaptation of ""Kojak"" starring Vin Diesel), all smart enough to embrace the new direction Bond is headed in, while also acknowledging the past.

""Skyfall"" goes back to Bond's origins in more ways than one. Silva (Javier Bardem), one of M's (Judi Dench) former agents is back and looking for revenge. He was once M's favorite and feels that she abandoned him during a difficult mission. He returns to steal a computer file containing the true identities of secret agents who are undercover. When he gets it, he threatens to release a certain number of names on a timed basis, threatening their lives and the missions. M wants the list back and sends Bond after it. But Silva is too good and is always one step ahead, manipulating everyone into doing exactly what he wants. Finally, Bond takes M to his childhood home, Skyfall, the Bond family estate in rural Scotland. Silva wants M and Bond knows that she will prove too powerful a lure to resist, drawing the villain to a more level battlefield.

Throughout, Bond wrestles with his own issues with M. Early on, she makes a controversial call and this leads the secret agent to question his loyalty to his boss. Then, when Silva enters the picture, Bond recognizes that he and the blond uber-villain are actually a lot closer than he may have anticipated. Silva knows this and uses this knowledge to push 007's buttons repeatedly.

Along the way, Bond meets a new Q (played by Ben Whishaw, ""Cloud Atlas"", BBC's ""The Hour"") who brings a new, nerdy sort of computer geek-ese to the role. Ralph Finnes plays Gareth Mallory, a government minister who is keeping a very watchful eye on M and her department. And Albert Finney plays Kincade, the groundskeeper at Skyfall. All of these actors are welcome additions and add a lot of interest and considerable acting skill to the film.

I think Bardem's performance is slightly overhyped. It is a good performance, but very similar to Anton Chiguhr in ""No Country For Old Men"". Both performances are very good, and fit with the respective films - Silva is more lighthearted and playful - but both men have the same intensity, drive and uncompromising attitude towards violence and mayhem. Bardem is a welcome addition to the Bond universe, but his role has a `been there, done that' feel to it.

No Bond film would be complete without beautiful women. Naomie Harris plays Eve, Bond's partner in the mission they are engaged in during the opening of the film. She is a new kind of Bond girl; displaying considerable skill and intelligence, she could be 007's equal. Berenice Marlohe, a French actress, plays Severin, a complicated, slightly enigmatic woman who seems to be Silva's henchwoman. She spends some time with Bond and begins to have conflicting feelings.

From the opening moments, ""Skyfall"" contains some terrific action. Unlike in some of the previous films, all of the action has at least a foothold in reality and all of it is linked to the story. In some Bond films, 007 seems to wander into action scenes devised to show off some new outlandish type of action or new device, narrative be damned. The gravity machine sequence in ""Moonraker"" is a good example of this. In ""Skyfall"", everything is connected to the MacGuffin, the computer list containing the identities of all of the secret agents working undercover. The film opens with Bond and Eve chasing a man through Istanbul, ending up on top of a train. When the list gets out of their hands, they soon learn Silva is behind the theft and will be publishing the identities. When Silva enters the picture, his plans seem to expand and encompass so much more, but they still start with the list.

Throughout the film, there are winks back to the early days of Bond. At one point, the action centers on a deserted island Silva now uses as his headquarters. The island is pretty interesting and the back-story is that Silva created a `scare' clearing off all of the inhabitants, leaving behind scary Soviet-era looking apartment buildings and huge statues of former leaders. This is a nice little nod back to the overly elaborate lairs of past Bond villains like Blofeld and Stromberg. Late in the film, Bond and M rush to a secret garage and uncover Bond's Aston Martin, complete with the ejector seat. There are more references, which are worked into the plot in a satisfying way, allowing old-time Bond fans to enjoy the moments while bringing the story arc closer to the early films.

When Craig was first announced as the new Bond, a lot of the publicity concentrated on his age. He was much younger than most of the actors who have played Bond, which led to the decision to `reboot' the series. But in ""Skyfall"", there is a lot of talk about how old Bond is, and jokes about how he should be retiring. It seems odd and out of place and even a little off-putting to be joking about his age when this very aspect was so highly touted as a positive just two short films ago. I really don't believe they are using this as the framework to introduce a new actor; Craig just signed a contract for two or three more films as 007 and ""Skyfall"" has now broken all box office records.

My few quibbles aside, ""Skyfall"" is not just a terrific Bond film, but it is a great action film and will no doubt be considered one of the best of Craig's forays as 007.",1355961600,,8398,4.619302949061662
5036406,4,B006X040NY,"Bond (played by Daniel Craig) is back in the third installment of the refresh to this franchise with a focus on his age as a ""00"" and recovering from an almost lethal gunshot to the chest. There's a lot of focus as well on Bond's relationship with his surrogate mother, ""M"" (played by Judi Dench), as well as the most detailed Bond movie about our tarnished hero's background (though the novels did speak in depth of his past).

In this tale the higher ups are thinking about shelving ""M"" and they're wondering if the ""00"" agents are even necessary in the high tech age. One particular high up is Gareth Mallory, played by Ralph Fiennes, who suggests to Bond this is a job for younger men. Something he doesn't want to hear and surely not the audience which makes Mallory a jerk for a good part of the story. But then an old contact to ""M"" shows up and he's a cyberterrorist coming after MI6 and ""M"" especially. Played by Javier Bardem who I thought did a fine job with the insanity acting. Notice how the cinematography and sound introduced him in his first scene.

The tale had some lulls in the plotting and arguably some minor plotholes.

Also starring Albert Finney and Naomie Harris.

Old School Bond fans will dislike that there are a lack of awesome gadgets and that Bond isn't ""getting it on"" with several hot women but then the latter has been prevalent in the franchise refresh at the beginning so I'm not sure why the complaints are coming out now in mass. That said, this particular movie humanizes Bond the most and may break the fantasy image.

This is the 50th anniversary of James Bond, by the way. Look for the nod to the Aston Martin of ""Goldfinger"". The Golden Globes have nominated this picture for it's ""Best Original Song"".

The budget for this picture was roughly $150-200M and so far it has made over $951M at the Box Office. Wowza.

In 50 years of Bond movies, Skyfall is only the second film in which James Bond suffers a gunshot wound. (He is also shot in Thunderball during the junkanoo chase.)

This movie is not direct story continuation of the previous two films the way Quantum of Solace followed Casino Royale. Producer Barbara Broccoli said that the series ""will go on to other different stories from now on."" However, the reappearance of the QUANTUM organization in later films is still a possibility. Broccoli has said: ""I think in some way, he will go after the [Quantum] organization. So in that sense, it may become a trilogy, but we haven't really structured it that way.""",1355875200,2,2746,4.654958677685951
5036407,4,B006X040NY,"The latest of the Bond movies delivers action and adventure just as we've been prepped to expect since the 1960s when Ian Flemings' books first hit the silver scene. The difference between the traditional Bond films and this one is that Bond is shown as a somewhat aging agent who many wish to retire, particularly after he is shot in the opening scene. M has another idea and approves his return to active duty. What I really enjoyed about this film is its introspective aspect. We see Bond returning to the home he grew up in and where his parents lost their lives. When the house blows up, his response is, ""I never liked that house anyway."" But, we meet the house's caretaker who knew Bond as a youngster and hear him talk about worthy of her talents. Daniel Craig's performance is spell-binding. Javier Bardem plays an artful smart and cunning villain. And, Bond's Aston Martin DB5 makes a brief reappearance.  This film is filled with action starting with the opening scene and continuing throughout. It's thoroughly appealing for an adult audience and for teens as well.

Here's what our kids have to say: I recently watch the new James Bond movie and it was amazing. I have seen every James Bond movie and this one is by far the best and everyone I have asked agrees. I love the antagonist in the movie and as weird as it sounds I thought that he was pretty crazy but in an acceptable way. The villain's name is Silva and Javier Bardem deserves an Oscar for the great job that he does portraying Silva. While I watched the movie, I was constantly wishing and imagining that I was a British secret agent. This movie follows James Bond (Daniel Craig) who is shot on a mission and ever since his wounding, people are saying the he is too old to still be doing dangerous field missions.  Bond refuses to hang his hat just yet and returns to MI6 when he finds out that M (Judi Dench) is being threatened.  An ex- agent of MI6 seeks revenge on M for reasons only known by them. His name is Silva and he is a psychopath. We find out that M has allowed something to turn him this way later in the movie.  Everything that Silva does or allows to happen is a part of a plan because he is just that much of a genius, but James Bond is determined to best him.  Bond has to go through everything to get to Silva and save M and, as usual, there is a new love interest named Eve (Naomie Harris) who helps him. In order to save M, Bond has to come to terms with his childhood because his parents were killed; and in the final face off Bond leads him to the one place that no one would think - Skyfall, his childhood home.

This movie deserves all of the stars in the sky, but since the highest is five; then I give this movie five out of five stars.  I love how all of the James Bond movies have the same concept so that there are no shake ups, and the writers give just enough prediction, but not too much to make the movie predictable. Some of the scenes in this movie have sexual connotations and are violent, so this movie is not appropriate for small children. I recommend this movie for ages thirteen and up because of the mature content.  Victoria B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

5036410,5,B006X040NY,"I am a huge Bond fan, though I don't go in for movie-related books so much as the films themselves. I consider Daniel Craig to be the best of the Bonds, simply because he embodies the physicality of the role in a way that none of the others could match. Suave means nothing if you have to have a fight with the mark you're following, and Craig can do both. I felt that this film was perfectly paced, and the details from past movies not so much an homage to the past as a nod to it while establishing definitively that this franchise is going in a new direction, the past and the future equally recognized. I think this is the best subtlety in the movie, and for all his personal failings Sam Mendes was a fantastic choice for director. I've seen it twice in theater and will probably go to see it at least once more. Watching this film was like drinking a fine wine. The visuals were breathtaking and the plot tightly wound, although Berenice was walking around the premiers like the cat that got the cream when her role really wasn't big enough to justify her strutting. This is a film where the Bond girls, though needed for the plot (esp. Naomi Harris), weren't as much a part of the action as we've seen in the past (i.e. the train wreck of Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough). The weaknesses of these girls were recognized in the film and each girl's role played to the strengths of the characters, if that makes sense. But at the end of the day, the center of this film was James Bond, and Daniel owns every scene he's in. Even Javier Bardem, quite possibly the creepiest villian of them all, can equal but not outmatch Mr. Craig.

This movie is worth every single penny, several times over. I have never been so entertained by a Bond film.",1355529600,4,1755,4.350609756097561
5036411,5,B006X040NY,"Casino Royale is one of my favorite movies, and certainly at the very top for action movies.  So it was with much sadness that I saw Quantum of Solace.  Few things can make me cry, but that movie was an abomination that essentially led me to tears.  So it was with some apprehension that I looked forward to Skyfall.  Knowing both ends of the spectrum, I didn't know if Skyfall would be more like Casino Royale or Quantum.  Luckily, it is right on par with CR and good enough that we can forget Quantum and act like Skyfall is the second movie in the Daniel Craig series.  This bond pays homage to old bond films and also leads us into a future bond era.  Not many franchises can leave you this excited 50 years after it began, but 007 is just as relevant today as it was back in the day.  It really is such a tight rope for films such as this, and it succeeds as very few franchises have been able to do (Star Trek).  Javier Bardem is amazing as Silva and has shown that few can play the psychotic villain as well as him.  The influence by The Dark Knight (my favorite movie) is apparent and Sam Mendes deserves a lot of credit for his ability to bring Bond into a darker era.  The cinematography is amazing and the action scenes are just as exciting as CR.  The opening scene rivals the opening scene to CR.  Instead of the romantic plot in CR, Skyfall focuses on Bond as a character and does a great job with his character.
  Skyfall is one of the best movies of 2012 and while I entered with reluctance, I left just as satisfied as I was when I saw Casino Royale 6 years ago.  The break in films was needed and they came back fresher than ever.  Special props to Daniel Craig as well, for continuing to give amazing performances for a timeless character.  Quantum of what?

5036414,2,B006X040NY,"To launch a new James Bond film comes with enormous pressure and responsibilities.  Expectations remain high for each new instalment, especially at its 50th anniversary.  Unfortunately, the end result is terribly disappointing film with a weak, disjointed and poorly written storyline, disregarding the rave reviews and sky hype.
Supposedly this is a retro-Bond, to hark back to the original Bonds by Sean Connery.  The film makers seek out the Oscar winning director Sam Mendes to helm the film based on the script by 3 credited writers.  The end result showed the multi-hands.
The title sequence remains good.
The first set piece which lasted over 10 mins was exciting and well-executed but recalled sequences from the Bourne series.
The next sequence was the assassination at night time in Shanghai that dazzled but resembled Mission Impossible series.
Then came the sequence on the Macau Dragon Boat Casino with lanterns, Komoto dragons, cardboard oriental henchmen/villains and oriental-looking women in heavy makeup where Bond met his first Bond girl who died shortly afterwards.
This sequence recalls the old Hollywood musical ""The Flower Drum Song"" which this time around looked tiring and politically incorrect.
Next came the introduction of the chief villain played by Javier Bardem who tried to inject some blood into his role but was disabled by the writers and director who modeled him from Hannibal Lector.
The highly anticipated finale was a huge letdown:  Bond and M escaped(Bond escapes?) to his birth estate in the Scottish highland and got hunt down by the chief villain and his mates.  This overlong set piece of the siege of the lone estate is so old that's needless to mention.
As for the Bond girls, there're only 2!  One became the new Money Penny who's supposed to be a sharp shooter but hardly looked believable.  The other was the short-lived Dragon Boat girl.  Sorry guys!
Instead, too much time was spent on Judi Dench who played M while Daniel Craig looked worn out and tired.

Casino Royale was phenomenal, but Quantum of Solace felt very slow in my opinion, so what would that make this one? I quickly found that this is a new classic. Craig's Bond is both brutal and believable which is what I think Fleming had in mind when he created the character.

I did not really enjoy quantum of solace but rather enjoyed casino royale. So I went into this not really knowing what to expect. I must say I was rather impressed and entertained.

The story starts out with an intense chase scene that grabs your attention right away. It may have been over the top a bit but still it was awesome. Through the chase and a risky shot, Bond is left for dead. Of course he survives but remains ""dead"" to the world until he sees on the news that MI6 has been attacked.  It seems that the terrorist behind the attack is always one step ahead. This film deals with Bond trying to prove to M and himself he still is the agent he always has been. MI6 is coming under heavy scrutiny for losing classified information all while ""M"" and Bond's relationship is stressed throughout the film.

Bond finally tracks down the terrorist behind the MI6 attacks to find that it is a former agent assumed dead.  This agent is a cyber terrorist who has immense power and a vendetta against ""M"". He tries to recruit Bond but fails as Bond brings him in only to discover this was his plan all along. The films follows Bond, ""M"", and the terrorist Silva to a gripping and entertaining end.

The soundtrack is amazing. I literally can't get enough of Adelle and the Skyfall song. Action is great...maybe a little less action than some of the other Bond's but nonetheless great. The story is very very personal. Which I actually liked. I must say that this is a great film that every action fan and bond fan must see.",1355184000,12,1629,4.380794701986755
5036417,2,B006X040NY,"Slow, humorless, boring, derivative, and joyless...

SPOILERS!

Let's set aside the fact that Skyfall didn't make the least amount of sense.  Sure, if Javier Bardem wanted to assassinate M, he didn't need a private island, a massive army of evil henchmen, and the hacking powers of God almighty.  He could have happily shanked her on the sidewalk somewhere, no fuss, no muss.  I wouldn't have cared if they hadn't taken away everything which made Bond cool.

It's a problem that he's a blonde thug, but it's even worse that he's gone from a suave, unflappable wisecracker to an emo moper.  Now, there are no chicks in bikinis, no corny puns, no cool gadgets, no insane action set-pieces and no fun.  Part of what made Pierce Brosnan the best Bond ever was that every cocksure second he was on screen he looked like he was having the best time of his life.  Yeah, Craig's Bond drives cool cars... but he doesn't savor it.  He's a sad sack who doesn't get an iota of enjoyment out of being an international superspy.

Probably because he sucks at it.  The plot is a list of him failing at things:

In the opener, he fails his mission (getting shot by both enemy and friendly fire), hides and drinks with frat boys.  Then he fails all his Mi6 evaluations, but M puts him back into service anyway. He tracks down a sniper, doesn't stop the assassination, and accidentally kills the sniper before getting any information out of him. When the girl's life is in danger, he can't save her because he's nervous and can't shoot very well.  He fails to stop Bardem from escaping MI6.  He lacks the credibility to convince anyone that Bardem is walking into the Ministry with a murdering rampage in mind.  Craig shows up late to the Ministry. Bardem has already killed a few people.  M only survives because two different guys throw themselves in front of bullets for her.  Craig walks in and, in a rare display of confidence, winks to a wounded man and shoots a couple fire extinguishers (yay Bond!).  This time, as Bardem escapes, Craig doesn't even try to follow him.  Instead, in a bold stroke of WTF,  Craig decides it's time to take M to his dead parents' decrepit mansion in the Scottish highlands, populated by a guy who's not Sean Connery.  Not because it's a secure location, but because Craig wants to blow it up, because he's so emo about it.  He fails to outmaneuver Bardem, so he tricks him into thinking he's dead by dropping into a frozen pond while Bardem watches (which totally works).  Finally, in the lamest ending in Bond history, Craig kills Javier Bardem by sneaking up and, without warning, throwing a knife into his back-- and M dies anyway.

This new Bond was supposed to be fresh and visceral, but instead they're re-hashing the exact same, ""Bond is a relic of a bygone era"" business that they were doing with Pierce Brosnan, but without Bond standing up for himself and pushing back.  He's witless, he can't spy for crap and he can't shoot straight.  And now Miss Moneypenny is a confident black feminist.

In Skyfall, Bond is England's whipping boy, and he takes it.

P.S.  There are no poker chips worth $4 million Euros each.",1355097600,8,3144,4.620938628158845
5036418,1,B006X040NY,"Okay, before I begin with my scathing review, this movie wasn't bad from an entertainment perspective.  I liked it.  I had fun and if there is any challenge to watching it, it was to turn off my brain long enough to enjoy the sheer fun of it.  A cerebral exercise, this movie is not.  Clich&eacute; villain, impossible plots without reason and big explosions is more this movie's forte.

This movie follows three evolutions.  Improbable, Stupid, and Impossible.

Improbable
1.  The opening sequence was great.  Still a little unbelievable to survive that immense fall.  It should have shattered every bone in his body on impact.
2. Bond left the shards in his body, which was causing immense discomfort for months.  Even the doctors at MI6 didn't think to remove them.
3.  The shards from his shoulder easily matched up to the henchman they had no details on, but was still able to track based on the fact he is only  1of 3 people that use the weapon.
4.  Bond lets the henchman assassinate a random dude when it was clearly in his ability to stop him.
5.  Bond dumps his only communication to his partner/slash backup in a martini drink prior to talking to the informant.  This seems like a very bad idea for a superspy.  Consider if Bond needs help, or he is killed and the backup needs to deliver the information.  By disposing the mic, his partner is left clueless.
6.  Bond sleeps with a prostitute.  Apparently STDs are a weapon of choice for 007.
7.  The villain is somehow able to infiltrate MI6 Headquarters, hack into the director's computer, and plant a bomb without anyone knowing.  How this is done is never explained.
9.  Bond lets the prostitute get killed.  Two minutes after she is murdered, it becomes abundantly clear Bond could have made his move before her death.  Considering Bond's reaction to a fellow agent he was ordered to let die earlier in the movie, you'd think Bond would be a little more sympathetic to saving her.
10.  Bond has a secret warehouse with a supped up super car complete with machine gun jublies, but no weapons stash.

Stupid
1.  The villains plot is to embarrass MI6, then kill M in some elaborate plot involving getting captured, escaping, M being questioned at the ministry for a previous failure to stop the villian, making his way to the ministry without out being caught or shot by security, and assassinating M.  At the beginning of the movie Bond was easily able to sneak into M's apartment flat and take her by surprise.  Villains are stupid.
2.  The villain's hideout is an abandoned city/island the villain had faked a biological disaster at.  You'd think the government would have sent in a HAZMAT team to investigate the incident, but apparently not.
3.  It only took two days to decrypt the secret file.  Using any modern encryption, even with the world's largest super computer, which the villain did not have, would have taken decades, if not centuries to accomplish.  The villain had nothing more than a room full of server racks with lots of wires hanging out from what I am pretty sure was nothing but rows of switches.  He needed a room full of Cray super computers, and I doubt that would have been successful, least not in 2 days.  BTW, what kind of bandwidth was he getting on that island and why wasn't service cut off when the island was abandoned?
4.  The MI6 super hacker can access anything he wants with a standalone desktop computer, which he was able to plug a thumb drive into with no concern for security on the entire network.  Not to mention Bond broke the encryption by randomly connecting plain text that was visible in the encryption (No modern encryption displays any type of plain text in the code).  Not to mention how impossibly well funded MI6 seemed to be.  I work for the government and I can't even get toner for the printer.
5.  I am fairly certain arsenic doesn't dissolve the bones (or muscles) in your skull.
6.  When MI6 moved to its underground layer, the villain somehow knew the complete layout, and exactly what room he would be held captive in, the security he'd be in, the sewer exit in the room, and the direction through the sewers to get to the ministry and where he needed to plant the subway bomb to sabotage Bond who would be arriving at the exact time a subway train was traveling over him.  He did this without so much as a watch.
7.  The villain was kept in a see through Plexiglas cage, bounded, with no bathroom while armed guards watched him.  Despite the unlikely prison quarters, somehow the villain escapes and kills the guards.  It is not shown how this is accomplished.
8.  The villain stands in the middle of an open room shooting people in a building filled with armed security and no one shoots him.
9.  Bond goes into hiding with M, leaving a trail for the villain to find him.  Bond doesn't think to put M someplace safe.
10.  MI6 doesn't send any sort of back-up to Bond's hideout to fight off the terrorist attack.
11.  The villain has a limitless supply of loyal henchmen who are killed off in droves and still relentlessly pursue Bond with no cover or backup.
12.  The villain shows up in a military grade helicopter.  Now, he had to fly from Britain to Scotland in this.  Does Great Britain have no Air Force or flight control?  Where do you get an attack helicopter to begin with?  Where was the villain keeping this stashed the whole time?  This is a country where you can't even own a 9mm.

Impossible.
1.  The two-way radio in Bond's ear work's perfectly, despite being miles underground, and separated by tons of rock and concrete.
2.  The whole house explodes, even the parts that weren't struck by the helicopter.  Not sure why, but it does.  I can only assume Mr. Bond left the pilot light off by accident.  Come to think of it, the carriage of the helicopter exploded too for some odd reason.  And why would an attack helicopter even explode at all?  For a machine designed to fly low into heavily armed enemy territory, it is awfully prone to spontaneous explosion when shot, killing all on board.
3.  While escaping down a tunnel, Bond dodges a fireball, consuming hundreds of feet of oxygen per second. (This is why I hated Independence day)
4.  Speaking of fire balls, Bond doesn't suffocate when the fire ball consumes all the oxygen in the tunnel.  Maybe the fireball forgot to do this.
5.  Bond doesn't suffer from any of the effects of hyperthermia when drowned in the ice pool.  He also doesn't think to pick up the bad guys weapon, (despite doing so repeatedly in the house) but this would have killed the clich&eacute;d foreshadowing from earlier when Bond was asked what good a knife will be.

Okay, I am done, and don't care to write more and I am sure everyone is tired of reading. The writing in this movie is horrible and filled with holes, but the action sequences are superb, and makes for an immensely entertaining movie if you don't think too much about it.  So lay back, shut off your brain and enjoy.  Not recommended to watch with yappy wives and over opinionated best friends like myself.",1355097600,53,7051,4.586869495596477

5036422,5,B006X040NY,"I've seen this film twice already and plan to see it one more time on an IMAX screen. I always like to see the Bonds several times in the movies before I decide where it stands among my other favorite Bonds.  I enjoyed it much more the second time.  I thought I would comment on it when it arrived on blu-ray, but since so many have commented already I thought I might as well add my two cents in.  Skyfall is a very good Bond film.  Is it one of my ten favorites? No.  Some of the reviewers seem to have gone over the top on this film. One declared it the best Bond film since Goldfinger.  Not quite.  (It reminds me of one movie critic in New York who in a moment of pure insanity in her review of Never Say Never Again declared it to be the best Bond since From Russia With Love.  It has since been re-evaluated and we can now see now what a total mediocrity it was.  But I digress.)
Based on most of the critics, one would think that Daniel Craig is the best Bond of all time.  Yet I met several people after seeing Skyfall (including my wife) who don't like him at all.  Look everyone has their favorite Bond.  As one who saw Dr. No in the movies, with my father, at age 13, I still think Connery is the best.  But I could make a case that there really hasn't been a bad James Bond.  Four out of the first 5 Connery Bonds are in my top 10 (YOLT, FRWL, Thunderball and Goldfinger.)  Yet Connery made the very average Diamonds are Forever, a huge disappointment after OHMSS.  He also made the totally unnecessary mess, Never Say Never Again.  Bond number 2, George Lazenby gets a bad rap for his acting.  Yet he starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a fantastic film and one of my top 5.  Roger Moore starred in two great Bonds: The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy and 3 very enjoyable and entertaining Bonds: For Your Eyes Only, Moonraker and Live and Let Die.  Moore also starred in the mediocre A View to a Kill and the terrible Man With the Golden Gun.  Timothy Dalton, who also takes a bad rap, starred in two excellent Bonds: the solid The Living Daylights and the underrated License to Kill, another of my top ten. (Dalton gets condemned for playing Bond the exact same way that Craig receives raves for.) Pierce Brosnan started at the top with the excellent Goldeneye and worked his way down to the silly and disappointing Die Another Day.  Which brings us to Daniel Craig.  Casino Royale was a tremendous film with 2 unbelievable action scenes in the first hour that virtually had very little to do with the actual plot.  It was beautifully directed by Martin Campbell who also gave us Brosnan's successful debut Goldeneye.  Craig then starred in Quantum of Solace, a rushed and massively boring Bond with action scenes that almost put me to sleep.  Skyfall is far better than Quantum (one of my least favorite Bonds) and not as good as Casino Royale, another of my top 10.
The film opens with a long pre-credit sequence that one critic labeled the best ever.  I don't think so.  I much preferred the openings of The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker and Goldeneye, among others.  Without giving too much away to those who haven't seen it: the film gives us much more about James Bond's childhood and background than we have ever seen.  Unlike most of the other Bonds, most of the action takes place in Great Britain, including a terrific chase seen in the London Underground (thats the Subways to a New Yorker like myself.)  The film also features one of the best casts of any Bond with Javier Bardem, (a great villain,) Ralph Fiennes and Albert Finney.  Also without giving too much away, the conclusion of the film is basically the beginning of the Bond films to come: no more deep thoughts and revenge plots, just good Bond action.  In an interview I read, Craig says that he would like to do a large scale action-packed Bond along the lines of the old Bonds, say You Only Live Twice or The Spy Who Loved Me.
In conclusion, as one who has seen each Bond film more times than I can possibly remember, Skyfall is solid entertainment.  As stated, it is not my my top ten, but probably in the top 15.  I am surprised at some of the negative reviews I've read here.  But don't worry, it just became the highest grossing British film of all time.  So two years from now, we can be assured that James Bond will be back.",1354752000,5,4327,4.350374064837905

5036425,4,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig made an impressive debut as Ian Fleming's super spy James Bond in Casino Royale, but its followup, Quantum of Solace, was a marked drop off which threatened to derail the franchise.  Enter director Sam Mendes (American Beauty), a well honed script (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan), and a dream cast.  The result is a well acted, emotionally compelling adventure thriller that takes the formula and rips it open to expose Agent 007 as we've never seen before.  It is also one of the best films of the year and certainly one of the very best Bond films.

British secret service agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) and fellow operative Eve (Naomie Harris) are in pursuit of a killer who has stolen a hard drive containing the names of all NATO agents imbedded in terrorist groups.  A fateful decision by MI6 boss M (Judi Dench) leads to Bond being put out of commission.  While M is being leveraged into retirement by her supervisor (Ralph Feinnes) and Bond has lost his edge, a mysterious figure (Javier Bardem) from M's past begins a reign of cyber terror and revenge.  As agent 007 struggles with his future and his loyalties to M, he must look to his past to reconcile his biggest challenge.

There are obvious comparisons to The Dark Knight Rises with a fallen hero searching for his `mojo'.  Most Bond films operated superficially and featured unusual characters, and with rare exceptions (On Her Majesty's Secret Service and of course the more recent Casino Royale) did we delve into the personal side.  While early incarnations of the super agent showed him nearly invincible, this Bond is a more humanized reinvention without emasculating its hero.  For the first time, Craig's Bond has a sense of humor with puns and quips (a staple of the earlier films).  In fact, much of the dialogue is sharp.

By delving into the core relationships, the filmmakers have added layers and twists to a conventional formula.  The main themes center on loyalty, sins of the past, and tradition clashing with the new order.  There are parallels between Bond and M as relics of an age gone by and between Bond and his doppelganger as direct opposites.

This is Dench's showcase as M.  Although her allegiance to Bond was a recurring theme in the previous two films with Craig, never before has her character been shown in such depth.  After seven Bond films, her M has gone from background to foreground as a primary plot point, and she does not disappoint.

There is a nice buildup to Bardem's entrance whose psychological motives are questionable including his sexuality.  This is not your father's Bond villain.  As Silva, a man with a dark past whose methods are bold and brazen, Bardem instills a decided creepiness and cunning that is refreshing. Think of Bardem's character as the black sheep of a dysfunctional family with M in the maternal role.

A strong supporting cast includes Ben Whishaw as the new quartermaster Q, a young computer whiz who represents the new breed of spy, Brnice Marlohe as a stunning beauty who holds the key to her dangerous employer, and Harris in a pivotal role.

With splendid global locations (Istanbal, Shanghai, and Scotland), this may be the most beautifully shot Bond film (Roger Deakins) since You Only Live Twice.  Some scenes are visual standouts like a sultry shower rendezvous and a moment of hand-to-hand combat all done in shadows and silhouette.

In this age of 24, Jason Bourne, and Homeland, the stakes are much higher in depicting realistic action and techie scenes, and Skyfall holds its own with solid set pieces including a subway bombing and a tense climax with echoes of Straw Dogs.  There are specific references to the Bond canon including the reappearance of a certain iconic car.

It is remarkable how current, top directors have been directly influenced or inspired by these movies.  Steven Spielberg did the Indiana Jones movies as homage to Bond films and even cast former Bond, Sean Connery, as Indy's dad!  James Cameron did his take on a super spy with True Lies.  Christopher Nolan filmed an entire sequence in Inception as tribute to Bond.  David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has Bond style, opening credits; (Skyfall has terrific credits and a sultry, throwback theme song by Adele).  Even Quentin Tarantino suggested several years ago that the Bond films needed to get gritty and basic; think the filmmakers took notice?

As J.J. Abrams' Star Trek and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins showed, a classic franchise can be reinvented or updated while reaping enormous dividends.  With the most touching finale to a Bond film, there are big surprises and a distinct familiarity by film's end that sets the series for a grand run.  For Bond purists, this is uncharted territory, but by `shaking' up the mythology, Bond's story has become `stirring'.",1354665600,19,4838,4.894478527607362

Casino Royale was a great way to reboot the franchise. Quantum Of Solace was ""fine"". It wasn't a bad film...but it lacked the Bond derring do we all know and love. Skyfall brings the last 50 years of Eon films full circle in a very heartfelt manner. It's touching at times, but not overwrought with pathos. The opening titles are my favorite in the entire series (although the award for best Bond theme still goes to Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger). Sam Mendes has shot a visually stunning film (probably the most artistically stunning of the entire series in terms of cinematography). Javier Bardem gives us a villian that could easily take his place among the most disturbing villains in cinematic history including the likes of Heath Ledger's Joker and Ted Levine's brilliant Buffalo Bill/Jame Gumb from Silence Of The Lambs. It was as if Bardem was actually channeling the two to create Silva and he owns every single scene that he inhabits throughout the film.

Daniel Craig is a great Bond and I look forward to future adventures now that we have the back story in place. Bring on the ""kiss kiss, bang bang""!!!!!",1354579200,12,1263,4.710407239819005
5036431,5,B006X040NY,"I absolutely hate when people make comments for media products when the product probably hasn't even gone to be produced yet.  If you want to comment on the film, Amazon has this great little site called the Internet Movie Database (IMDB for short.)  There you can comment to your heart's content.  However since some of you have decided to bash the film here, let's breakdown some of the complaints.

The biggest one is that it wasn't as good as the first two Craig Bonds or Pierce Brosnan movies.  I'll let you in on a little secret...neither of those films were true to the character/franchise.  The girst two Craig Bonds did what hadn't done before, it created a story arc over two films in the franchise.  Bond fans know that the one way to make James Bourne's QOS watchable is to watch it immediately after watching Casino Royale.  As for Brosnan era movies, Goldeneye was a good not great Bond movie and every movie afterwards was worse than the one before.  It got to the point that the series had ""jumped the shark"" by the time they got to Die Another Day with Halle Berry trying to impersonate Ursula Andress and the storyline/stunts went from somewhat believable to ridiculous.  A reboot was needed.

With that as the background for my review of the movie, according to many Bond experts and reviewers, only two men have had the look and played the part of Bond as Ian Fleming intended.  One was Dalton...an actor who was strongly considered to take over the role directly from Connery but was deemed too young at the time.  The other is Craig.  The funny thing about Craig is that after watching him as Bond, you can't help but to view him as Bond in his other movies whether it be Layer Cake or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  That is the sign of a great Bond actor.

To fully appreciate this movie you have to watch or have a general high level knowledge of all older Bond movies.  The biggest reference was to the Goldfinger Aston Martin which any real fan of the franchise could tell you of that particular car's importance to the series.  (My jaw almost hit the floor when they opened the storage bin and I immediately knew what it was.)  There were all kinds of other references that a Post-Moore Bond fan wouldn't understand.  Little things like the original Bond Theme or very short snippets of music from past films (way too many to list.)  Even Q branch is back to the early Bond films with one ""gadget"" where the technology is actually already there for it to be feasible in the real world.  Personally I loved how they reintroduced Eve (Moneypenny with a built-in background), Q [branch] with a technogeek vibe, and perfectly handled the M handover.

In short, everyone is entitled to their opinions but in the case of Skyfall many of the opinions that have been posted are based in ignorance of past Bonds or the fact that James Bond is not, will not, and should not ever be in the same style of movie as the Bourne Series. QOS which is like I said at the beginning is a terrible standalone movie in the series since it's essentially James Bond in a Jason Bourne style of movie due to horrendous decisions which started with the producers' pick of directors.  In Skyfall they (or if you believe the drunken Craig offering the directing job to Mendes story) made the perfect selection for a director and made sure to include references to most of the past films.  Fitting for the franchise's 50th anniversary.",1354579200,4,3435,4.564437194127243
5036432,5,B006X040NY,"Although I remain a loyal fan to the Bond of my youth (Roger Moore), Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, one of the very best of the rest. In Skyfall he demonstrated how he has matured into the character - and the writing and execution of virtually every other aspect of this film are superior to his first two outings. Some viewers are finding this Bond outing a bit slow moving. I didn't, although it is admittedly more restrained than many other films from the series. Nevertheless, I found it engaging from beginning to end. I thought certain parts of the film packed an emotional punch seldom felt in other Bond films.

It is interesting how the public's expectations for Bond have changed. When View to A Kill premiered critics blasted the level of violence and even Roger Moore said he thought at least one scene in that movie went too far. The current take on Bond is far more violent and the bad guys are often presented in a much darker light than the villains of old - even if ultimately their dastardly deeds end up having similar effects. I'm looking forward to what comes next in this long running series and highly recommend this entry.",1354492800,203,1147,4.541062801932367
5036433,3,B006X040NY,"The reviews flowed in. Best reviewed Bond movie ever. Biggest overseas opening ever for a Bond movie. That just proves a good point: consensus doesn't prove anything.

I was the kid who stayed glued to the TV on all the old TBS Bond movie marathons during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I've read a good deal of the source material books from Ian Flemming. But I have no fanatical attachment to either. On the contrary, I just happen to enjoy the simple escapist window Bond opens to an audience.

Daniel Craig isn't a bad Bond at all and he's definitely a product of the ""Jason Bourne"" generation of action movies of stoic heroes where the Brosnan productions often veered into the Roger Moore fantasy camp - which I actually didn't mind. So the cold and stale touch of Skyfall actually compliments his character, but it can't save the movie from the doldrums it ""falls"" into from time to time. Javier Bardem was good, but I think Moriarity in BBCs Sherlock was more of a threat to London than this guy.

Plain and simple, Skyfall was expertly constructed, but pretty dry and the narrative was a jumbled mess of pacing. There were undoubtedly great ideas, but none of them were well capitalized on. The pieces never really fit together. It's as if the three writers agreed the movie would star Daniel Craig, then went their separate ways and wrote three different movies then tied them together with string before filming. Even Hollywood fix master editor Stuart Baird didn't tighten this one up very well. There was a lot of shifting in seats and not a laugh to be heard in the theater I sat in.

Money Penny, M, Q and the Aston are here to signify that Jason Bourne is finally dead and Bond we all remember has returned. Maybe, but this coming from a book worm with a long attention span: this Bond was boring.",1354492800,9,1810,4.594427244582043
5036434,2,B006X040NY,"I'm generally a bond fan and I really like this new bond.  He's smart.  He's sexy.  But we went to see this new movie and, when it was finished, we all just looked at one another and shrugged.  None of us liked it.  Boom - boom - bang - bang - boom - boom - hey, you're getting old - boom - boom.  That's about the plot and the dialog.  Seems that a lot of people liked it.  Shrug.  Maybe they are programmed by the telly to want to watch violence in movies.  I guess it helps them to be complacent when they see innocent people in other countries being murdered so we can steal their oil.  Like I say, I really like bond movies, but I cannot recommend this one.",1354492800,7,662,3.9770992366412212
5036435,5,B006X040NY,"Sean Connery defined the original Bond: as much playboy as civil servant, and always quick with a quip. Half a hundred years later, Daniel Craig redefines the character - grittier, darker, and a lot tougher. This new entry in the Bond canon develops that character further, digging deeper into his past and into the political realities squirming behind any government agency.

Dame Dench does an outstanding job, again, as M. Chase scenes work well, but don't have the central place they've had in other Bond flicks. The exploding-everything ending is as good as any, though, and comes across with a more personal feel than any other to date. And Naomie Harris keeps the Bond Girl tradition alive, strong, and looking very good.

Now well past the twentieth movie in the franchise, you might expect some serious sequel slump. It's not happening, though. Craig's Bond has rebooted the series, and it's up and running better than ever.

5036436,1,B006X040NY,"Until Skyfall, Daniel Craig, as James Bond, was an inspired characterization. In the earlier two Craig/Bond movies we had a glimpse of the inner Bond, along with a manly grittiness which lent a degree of realism to the character.

In Skyfall, Bond is barely recognizable as our hero. Indeed, his appearance is that of an aged alcoholic. He reeks of weakness and his incompetence is manifest. He undergoes testing to confirm his mastery of the tools of his trade--and fails utterly. He cannot even hit a man-size target with a handgun at 20-30 feet.

The best that can be said of Skyfall is that the first half of the movie was reasonably interesting. The remainder was boring and unforgivably predictable.

My girlfriend observed that it was as if the director loathed the James Bond character. Consistently, Craig/Bond was shown in the worst possible light: His clothes were ill-fitting and from a bygone age; he was weepy, unsure of himself, and a physical wreck. His visage was of one who had recently spent long masturbatory hours at a peep show.

Finally, even in a Bond movie, it is an unacceptable assault on our credulity for our hero to be wounded by one round to the shoulder, another round to the body from a high velocity rifle, take an uncontrolled fall for a couple of hundred meters into water--and survive.",1354320000,31,1322,4.785087719298246

When I begin to doze off I wonder what I spent my ten bucks on. Skyfall is on its way to making a billion dollars, and I am happy for the franchise, but I hope we're not going to see more like it. People talk about how its more into characterization, but I really don't feel I know Bond any better after the movie than before it. We've got a completely pointless Bond Girl (pity her at future publicity gatherings-plenty O'Toole was 100 times more memorable with 1/10th the screentime). Then there's Alfred at Bond Manor, the Fleming touch of the Komodo dragons in a scene absolutely devoid of the Fleming style, and finally just a complete lack of INTRIGUE: a clever plotline and a good dose of suspense. And I never liked Judi Densch as M. From Golden Eye to Skyfall all she did was complain, criticize, and dis anything classic Bond. She even has to complain about the DB5 when Bond is protecting her (masochist that he is) in Skyfall. He really should have shot her through the roof; I would have given that a standing ovation! Instead, we must endure over two hours of waiting for her to die off. When Ralph Fiennes takes over the title and Bond walks into his office, I'm like, ""Yes, finally a 007 movie is starting!!!"" But then its over and the credits roll.",1354320000,4,1424,4.3977272727272725

In short this flick is mainstream movie appropriate for 1950th not 2012.",1354233600,10,353,4.80327868852459
5036440,2,B006X040NY,"First, let me say that I've been a fan of James Bond films since the Roger Moore era.  Those films were chalk full of wit and charm, complete with spectacular stuntwork.  Who can forget Roger Moore skiing off a cliff prior to one of the opening montages?  I also enjoyed Timothy Dalton as 007, Pierce Brosnan who probably comes in third place and Sean Connery for nostalgia, in last.  Films aside, for who embodied Bond the most, I'd probably say Timothy Dalton or Sean Connery had the whole package.  Brosnan was a little too pretty and Moore a little too unbelievable/goofy.

Daniel Craig's portrayal of the debonair super spy has physicality but zero flair.  Craig has no wit and moreso than this, is not that attractive to look at.  Because he looks like a rogue, they have to dress him in very modern Tom Ford suits vs. the tailor-made classic Brioni that Brosnan wore.  This is a let down to the series.  He also sports a black cord to his ear like a soldier on a Black-Ops training mission.  Bond is supposed to fight to the beat his own drum, not take orders from superiors through an earpiece!  What has happened to the franchise?

This film had zero spectacular stunts, zero gadgets and Bond girls with little to no screentime.  Everything that you'd expect from a Bond film was totally missing.  There has to be a happy medium from the overtly CGI-laden Die Another Day with it's cheap gimmicks like the ""invisible"" Aston Martin to this film.  I understand that the producers want a more realistic and perhaps grittier film but in all honesty, this film loses the fun factor.  It has been said that this film had 500 shots that were CGI based which places it second behind Die Another Day.

It also should be noted that the director, Sam Mendes, took inspiration from the Dark Knight trilogy with this film.  The similarities are astounding and furthermore reinforce that this movie is garbage.  The title itself isn't even from an Ian Fleming novel which is surprising to say the least.  Daniel Craig has said that he wants out of making Bond movies and this sentiment translates on screen.  Berenice Marloh (Severine) even said Craig wouldn't even take off his underpants for the shower scene.  Is he gay?

It seems as though the producers of the film invested their money in the cinematography versus stuntmen and elaborate action setpieces.  The ending at Bond's lodge, SkyFall felt like it was out of a Van Damne movie complete with floorboards booby-trapped with shotgun shells.  What happened to Bond infiltrating the villain's lair?  There were even corny references to past Bond films with the reintroduction of the DB5 from the Sean Connery days.

I can't say how I wish I waited until this movie came out on Blu-Ray.  I saw it for $20 in IMAX on a BAD blind date and I wish I had saved my money.  I think with the 50th Anniversary, this film is a ""reboot"" of sorts.  Let's hope that what we've come to expect from a James Bond film gets reinstalled for the next outing set for release in a couple more years.  Unfortunately, Craig will still be at the helm!",1354233600,3,3079,4.613259668508287
5036441,5,B006X040NY,"In general Bond movies tend to be action fun, some are campy and cheesy, some are more straight action. Bond is always suave, and the women always attractive. Those elements are still there, we have the action, a bit of camp (the Aston Martin has a glorious homage to campy days) and we have a surprisingly well crafted movie.

Themes and motifs appear through out the movie and are called back to multiple times. Nothing is wasted, if you see something in the first half, it'll have relevance in the second half. The theme and motif of mirrors plays an important role with multiple illusions and distractions caused by reflections, and the fact that Mr Silver is himself a dark reflection of where Bond is and what he's going through.

Old vs New and Human vs Technology permeate the movie as we see a film that joyously stands up for the old fashioned spy movies and spy work. One of the questions that's explicitly brought up is do we need human intelligence assets in a world where we can gain so much through technology? The movie, as one should expect, points out the value of having human operatives.

Enjoy the movie, pay attention, and be surprised by a shockingly deep Bond flick.",1354233600,10,1190,4.60377358490566
5036442,1,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond, the thing is the the storyline of this film is ridiculous. Seriously flawed storyline. Just to explain how plain stupid this film is I will simply describe the part that upset me the most. So after Bond comes back to MI6 he has to take tests to show that he is fit for field work. On the target test he fails the test badly, he rushes to the washroom and with a sharp item jabs his wound to find several metallic objects that he submits for tracking/testing. Keeping in mind that bond was gone for months to come back alive, we are expected to believe that these metal fragments were in his body the whole time. It gets more ridiculous from there because the fragments are tracked to only 3 people in the entire planet that use a special metal for custom made bullets. Three pictures pop up and Bond identifies the person they are after, the person is quickly identified as a ""GHOST"" someone they have absolutely no info on, but apparently they know the bullets he uses and have a great close up picture of him. So what do they do? They call in a favor from the CIA and that all it took to find where and when this guy will show up to get his next target and thats where the movie jumps to as bond finds his target. I wanted to walk out right there! Later in the film We discover SKYFALL is the mansion/area where bond is from and we find out about bonds past that quickly turns into BATMAN. Rich background, parents died when he was young, as an orphan M picked him for MI6, caretaker/butler was watching over the estate, tombstones with bonds' parents etc. He purposely leaves a method to be tracked down that only the villein can track down who is after M. So bond has a day or two to prepare and he sets traps and rigs the place up for the incoming battle. BUT! he keeps M (Old woman) with him and not transfer her to a secure location away from the danger! I don't know what else to say, just bad writing, and completely disappointing. At least the 70's we expected the story to be over the top and outrageous, this was just stupid.",1354233600,31,2071,4.272264631043257
5036443,5,B006X040NY,"Until Daniel Craig took over the role with ""Casino Royale,"" I was never a big James Bond fan. I enjoyed some of the films, but I never found him to be a very compelling hero. At times, he even seemed like a parody of male fantasy - an infallible, oversexed, entitled alpha male. Craig brought new life into the character, making him a scrappy, visceral hero, and with his piercing gaze revealed a depth to the character I had never seen before.

Whether it's a response to the tough times we've living in, or strictly a matter of creative direction, James Bond 2012 is no longer living a male fantasy. Sure, he still has the ability to seduce and bed beautiful women, but aside from that, things have gotten tough. In the beginning of ""Skyfall"", Bond is accidently shot by his own team while on top of a moving train, where he falls hundreds of feet into a body of water. Thought dead, he takes the opportunity to disappear for a while and enjoy the anonymous life. It's only when MI6 is attacked on their own turf and the results are so overwhelming that it makes the international news that Bond decides to reemerge.

Upon his return, Bond is no longer in top form. Craig is far from the oldest actor to play the character, but his superiors and co-workers seem to think he's too old to be continuing as a field agent. His injuries have left him with an unsteady trigger finger, and his heavy drinking and pain medication have made him a liability. M (Judi Dench) only clears him to return to action out of a mix of desperation and loyalty. 2012's James Bond is no longer a superhero. He's tough, stoic, and brave, but he's no longer the alpha male - he's the underdog.

Bond goes about tracking down the man who both blew up MI6's headquarters and is now revealing the identities of covert field agents (guaranteeing their deaths.) When he does come across Silva (Javier Bardem), that's when things get really interesting. In the case of ""Skyfall"", not only is the hero a much more interesting character, but the villain is fascinating. A disgraced and destroyed former MI6 agent himself, the character seems to want nothing more than to destroy his former boss M by first destroying everything that means anything to her - her reputation, her co-workers, and her country.

In the film's final act, Bond takes M to ""Skyfall,"" the Scottish estate where he was born and raised. The most logistically safe place to do final battle with Silva is also Bond's most emotionally dangerous territory - the place where he lost his parents as a boy. It's here that the three damaged, strong central characters - Bond, M, and Silva - have to face themselves and each other.

""Skyfall"" is an example of an elevated action film. When I grew up in the 80's, action films were mostly populated by hack actors, with weak storylines and mediocre directing. Skyfall utilizes a talented filmmaker (Sam Mendes, the man behind ""American Beauty""), powerhouse actors (Craig, Bardem, and Judi Dench are all wonderful) a strong script and lush cinematography to prove, once again, that any genre of film can be elevated when the people behind it have the talent and skill required.",1354233600,15,3158,4.662477558348295
5036444,5,B006X040NY,"To start off, I need to say to all the jokers that say this is a bad movie... I wish you would fall 300 feet from a bridge into water like Bond did at the beginning of the film.

This is a top 5 bond film (behind Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, Casino Royale, and Goldeneye).

We finally get a glimpse into Bond's past, see some things we've never seen before, and get completely shocked by others.

Daniel Craig is an amazing Bond, in the mold of what Fleming originally created.  Behind Connery, Craig is #2.

I took my girlfriend to see this movie, who has only seen Casino Royale as her other Bond film, and she LOVED it.  Not only does this film give you action and an adventure, but shows the depth of Bond (and Craig) as a human being.

This is a MUST WATCH, MUST OWN.",1354147200,8,778,4.181208053691275
5036445,2,B006X040NY,"Like most James Bond fans, I was pretty taken with Casino Royale. Here was at last the plausible Bond film the studios had so often promised then failed to deliver- James Bond with a minimum of cute gadgets and a maximum of bombastic mayhem. So what if a third of the film was a poker game, and that game was so confusingly shot that you could barely tell who was winning and how? Here was a return to the roots of Bond. It felt like From Russia With Love all over again.

Fast foreword to Quantum of Solace, and everything went down the tubes. Back was the over-serious silliness of the Brosnan years (the villain lives in an exploding hotel and steals rivers Carmen Sandiego style) and a major character (the sexy but physically and emotionally scarred South American secret agent hunting a renegade general) was shamelessly lifted from License to Kill, which most Bond fans will tell you is one of the three or four WORST Bond movies. That the whole package was only a little more than an hour long was a tender mercy.

With Skyfall, early reviews were quite promising. No more silliness, the word was. Back to the grit! Sadly, this is absolutely not the case.

The film's start lets you know what's in store. After an admittedly exciting chase (which can be read as a huge slap in the face to female drivers pretty easily) we get an introduction with smoky soul music and dancing naked lady silhouettes- we might as well be in an early Moore film at this point (not that I have anything AGAINST Adelle's excellent opening track). This sets the tone for a sloppy return to 60s goofiness. Does the villain have a private island? Does a henchman get killed in a pit of exotic creatures? Does Bond sleep with a high-class hooker who is then murdered in some ridiculous way? The answer to all of these questions is yes. Bond even trots out Connery's gadget-laden DB5, which begs the question of whether the events of the classic Bond films were meant to have happened in this continuity somehow.

The few bits of the movie that are not grifted from the Bonds of the '60s-'80s are just confusing. Why does the villain need to be arrested and taken to MI6 headquarters so he can escape into the London underground, a location with literally hundreds of public entrances? Why does a master hacker live in a hugely obvious location where he is the only inhabitant? Why is a big deal made of Bond's tiny radio when he had one injected into his arm in Casino? The whole movie is full of holes you can drive a truck through. Worse, an overplay on Bond's orphan-dom, complete with a brooding ancestral mansion and crusty old manservant (who was obviously meant to be Sean Connery until casting actually happened) all suggest that the filmmakers sort of want us to think of James Bond as an English Batman.

There are gleams of light here and there- Daniel Craig still has some of the best screen presence and swagger of any Bond, and Dench's M is outstanding, but they aren't enough. By the film's end, when Bond has failed to achieve anything and walks right into M's classic office from the 60s (padded door and all) the movie's descent into confused irrelevance is complete.

At least we have Casino Royale, I guess.

PROS:
-Solid performances from the principals
-Beautifully shot (but there are really no ugly Bond movies)
-Not boring
-Has an Aston Martin in it
-Good soundtrack, especially compared to Quantum

CONS:
-Confused screenplay equates surprise to quality and fails to deliver either
-Plot holes that Timothy Dalton could 5-wheel a semi full of cocaine through
-Needless nostalgia tripping that just makes everything feel silly and contrived
-Skyfall is a big scary house with a grouchy Scotsman living in it. This makes it officially the lamest eponymous story element in any James Bond film.
-Aston Martin is blown up instead of driven to Monaco as it should be",1354147200,21,3870,4.664222873900293

I'm a long time Bond fan, and have stuck with them through thick and thin (Die another Day was quite thin).  I don't want to give plot lines away, but this movie pulls everything together that ever was, is and will be James Bond.  The start sequence is classic Bond filled with exhilarating fight, car chase and gun fire scenes.  Adele's musical intro is a true return to the Big Band music I grew up with, and the visual sequence that goes with it is stunning.  As you watch the movie you get to see where each of the parts from Adele's intro come together.  The plot is marvelous, with delightful `nods' to James Bonds of the past, that can only leave you with a knowing smile.  None of the punch-lines are excessively corny, simply leaving you snickering.  The grand finale is beautifully elegant, tying loose ends together with subtle details that please the heart.  Yes, I'm a Bond fan.  I know there have been some pretty stupid Bond movies in the past.

5036448,5,B006X040NY,"Is it possible to like a movie so much that suddenly all the previous movies in the franchise have become better in your eyes?  I would have thought such a thing impossible, until I saw Skyfall.  Up until having watched this film (which I went to see on a theater on a whim), I had neither love nor disdain for Bond films.  They were fine for me, but they were nothing special, I watched them on TV if they were shown, but I didn't rent them, much less buy them.  Yet I did know enough about the character and the mythology to understand some key elements that would have great importance in this last film.

To put it simply, I loved this movie.  Every single part of it was great.  Even with my amateur knowledge of the franchise, I was able to understand every (or at least most) in-joke or reference to previous films, since, of course, the story, the villain and the rest of the characters are fantastically written and played.  The most important part, though, is that this movie made me realize how much I liked Bond films.  I suddenly saw the previous movies in the franchise in a new light.

Since I loved J.J. Abrams' film I purchased the first season of the original TV series and it was a little hard to get into.  But to my delight, having received the set and promptly watched a couple of the movies, I found that I really liked them.  I'm looking forward to the release of this film on Blu Ray and I will be updating my review when I receive it.",1354060800,5,1918,4.82262996941896
5036449,5,B006X040NY,"Note: I will update this when I get the actual Blu-ray.

Before I get to this most recent rendition of Ian Fleming's renowned franchise, let me start by talking about its influence. It's been 50 years since the character has been around in movie form with a total of 9 actor portrayals. Sean Connery WAS my favorite, with Pierce Brosnan at 2nd, and I guess Roger Moore at 3rd. Historically-speaking, I grew up watching a lot of the films on TV during TBS's Bond marathons. I loved the escapist reality, the sort of spy-fantasy nature, and the coolness of all the sleuthing, gadgetry, exoticism, and grandeur that became a staple of Bond since the '60s. But like all things, there comes a time when adaptation becomes necessary for survival. In relation to Bond, I was kinda' getting tired of the flashiness, that at some point in Brosnan's later run, started to become a bit stagnant. Then along came the Bourne movies, which for all intents and purposes re-defined the spy-thriller genre with a fresher, grittier depiction that relied less on flash (at least from the perspective of gadgetry) and more on actual character development.

When Daniel Craig was cast as the newest 007 the influence of Bourne was very apparent in 2006's Casino Royale. It embodied everything Bond fans have come to love: the exotic locales, the stylish wardrobe, the beautiful girl (Eva Green was quite stunning), and of course, great action. But what's this? Not only was it everything we've come to expect out of Bond, but it even tried building his character. Long story short: Casino Royale is the beginnings of Bond. It portrays him as brash, wild, hard-headed, yet mentally tough. After falling in love with Vesper Lynd, his ""armor"" is broken and we see that he does, indeed, have a softer side and that he's still a salvageable human being. When he loses her, he goes on an angry revenge streak in Quantum of Solace, only to realize the emptiness that vengeance would bring him as well as all the collateral pain and destruction he caused in its wake. Instead, he comes to peace by forgiving himself and those involved making for what was, in my opinion, a masterful story arc that definitely re-vitalized my interest in the franchise.

And then came a Bond hiatus thanks to MGM being stuck on the verge of bankruptcy. It took 3 years, but the new one is finally here; Skyfall. I've heard a few people complain about the first 2 Craig movies saying they were too much of a ""Bourne ripoff."" I disagree with that notion because Bourne is awesome, so combining cool with awesome was okay for me, and I think the majority agrees. That being said, here's take three for Craig, this time under the helm of Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes. Now I've yet to see his claim to glory in American Beauty, but I have seen Road to Perdition, which I highly regard as a masterpiece in its own right for its dark, gritty, and bittersweet story of violence, redemption, and the touching bonds across multiple generations of fathers and sons. Craig worked with Mendes in Road to Perdition, and although Craig's role in the film was relatively low-key, I have to say I was really excited at the prospect when the news of his hiring was announced, as if the first 2 Craig movies weren't enough of a character study already.

So how did the pairing work? (*clears throat*) Ahem.. brilliantly! There are so many things that work for this film from the plot, directing, overall presentation, and certainly, the very character-building elements that made the first two movies so engrossing. To me, Skyfall first and foremost comes off as a point of transition in Craig's career as 007. In fact, I'd even say it's a kind of ""midlife crisis"" for the character of Bond. Sounds weird, right? But hear me out. In the first, I dunno, 20 minutes of the movie we see Bond on mission in Istanbul, Turkey. He gets wounded and fakes his death for a little bit to get away from MI6 and the stress and pressure of being a double O agent. But when MI6 is exposed to, basically, the entire world, Bond comes out of ""temporary retirement"" to do what he does best: find the bad guys and kill 'em. However, he comes back in not-so-great condition. He's out of shape, can't shoot straight, has some lingering psychological issues with his past, but M still believes in him even amidst an investigation of her efficiency as their leader by the bureaucrats in Parliament.

To summarize Craig's performance without spoiling much else, it comes down to the way he plays the whole ordeal out. Frankly, he (the character) looked like crap when he came back. I mean, physically and mentally: he had a scruffy looking beard growing, he wasn't as witty or verbally sharp as he had been in the first two movies, and it took him a while to get his stride back. But when he does, it's pretty bad-ass. The real joy in it, though, is seeing him fall into such ineptitude and rising back to prominence. Meanwhile, to fill the gap in-between this resurgence is the amazing job by Javier Bardem as the villain. If you haven't seen No Country For Old Men yet, then you haven't seen what Oscar-worthy performances are made of. He was scary and menacing in No Country. But here, he's scary, crazy, and plain-out creepy. I love the fact that Bond actually has a formidable villain to battle this time around as opposed to just ""sneaky, under-handed thinkers with bad intentions."" Bardem's character provides such a striking contrast in character and has so much screen presence, that I really can't think of how any of the next movies will top this.

And then to compliment all that kick-assery character dynamic is the presentation. Bourne and Bond lovers, rejoice. Skyfall is the perfect balance of the old school and new school. The film is as freshly-analytical as Bourne, but with just the right amount of vintage Bond elements to create this wonderful infusion of new and old. It's gritty, cerebral, and dark, yet flashy enough, very stylish in certain parts (love that night fight in the Shanghai building!), and contemporary in respect to the old Bond movies. Yes, Ms. Moneypenny and Q are re-introduced. But the beauty is that it's very subtle and underplayed, almost like a quirk more so than an homage. No, there aren't a whole bunch of gadgets, and we'll see what the future holds if Craig can churn out another 2 or 3 movies. But yeah, like I mentioned about Mendes' Road to Perdition being a movie about generations, his talent in handling such material really shows through Skyfall. If you've yet to see Perdition, then do so. It will help the themes and undertones of Skyfall seem a little more apparent.

In terms of the technical aspects. I really enjoyed.. well, everything. The cinematography by Roger Deakins (who should've won an Oscar by now, dammit) is stellar. Action scenes have a wider lens to them, even more so than Casino Royale, and a lot more than Quantum of Solace. Gone are the Bourne-like fast-cutting edits of Quantum. Things are a little more static, with minimum zooming to give the scope of the film that big, grand Bond effect fans have been clamoring for. The film was shot digitally with mostly Arri cameras and even the Red Epic on some of the action scenes. The opening sequence and song by Adele are spectacular, and the score by Thomas Newman has a great mix of electronic and orchestral pieces (again with the theme of new and old school fusion). Actually, listening to the score while typing this, I hear a lot of influences: lots of Bond theme, a little bit of Bourne-type percussion, a little Dark Knight brass dynamics, and some occasional string and piano for the build-up/calmer moments.

All in all, I didn't think Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace could be topped (by the way, I consider those as one big movie, not a sequel to another). In fact, after what both of those movies did, I didn't think old-school Bond would be as appealing to me thereafter. I was wrong. Skyfall goes above and beyond by not only elevating the character of James Bond, but also bringing back what made the franchise popular in the first place. Craig has been and still is my favorite Bond, and Bardem is easily my favorite villain. I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about all the stuff I mentioned and how I can't say more about it because 1) it'd be way too long, and 2) spoilers are bad. If you're reading this and take my words to be enticing enough, I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did. And yes, I believe Craig can make at lest 2 more movies, maybe even 3 if he stays in shape and they don't make the sequels any more physically demanding. Thanks for reading, and don't forget to watch this in a good theater. The one I went to (AMC Stonebriar) used a Sony 4K projector, but had an absolutely terrible scratch on the screen that's quite noticeable.

Skyfall is so badly written it hurts. the screenplay is dumb and unacceptable). why the hype pushed this film so much and why it get so much positive reviews ? nobody knows. but the film is bad.  and nothing more.,1353801600,13,308,4.6

The movie starts off fairly well but by the middle is completely lost and the ending is a joke.  Gimme a time machine please because I want James Bond back--",1353715200,29,247,4.23404255319149
5036452,4,B006X040NY,"As noted above, this is a terrific movie with many topics for discussion.  That's not something one can say about many Bond movies but issues of authority, the difficulties of being a spy, modern technology's limits, et al  certainly provide additional depth.  It's probably just as well not to think too hard about the plot, however, as there are some points you could drive a truck through....and that is done pretty often.  The athleticism of the stunts was incredible and the chase scenes remarkably destructive and just plain remarkable.  This is a return to the first Bond with Craig (after the disappointment of QUANTUM OF SOLACE) but with more issues and less sex.

Here is a warning.  I saw it in IMAX and the sound was so loud that it was painful and unbearable.  Fortunately, I had ear plugs with me, which made it tolerable.  These plugs - from the drug store - remove the very loudest sounds,  leaving the music and the spoken words perfectly audible.  While the special effects are very special indeed and super-dramatic, I would have walked out because of the sound if I didn't have the plugs.

Highly recommended.",1353715200,4,1129,4.762886597938144
5036453,4,B006X040NY,"The now half-century-old James Bond franchise is still the epitome of spy-versus-spy action cool having survived the Cold War all the way through the new millennium, and Daniel Craig continues to carry the mythic mantle with steely resolve in his third entry in the series. Directed by top-level filmmaker Sam Mendes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty/dp/B003VJTGLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty</a>), this 2012 movie manages to be both a cheeky throwback to the character's legacy and a state-of-the-art Bourne-inspired terrorist thriller. It opens in classic style with a breathless chase through the streets of Istanbul and literally on the rooftops of the old city's Grand Bazaar with Bond and MI6 operative Eve hot on the trail of a target carrying a hard drive containing the identities of every British Secret Service agent. A shot is fired, mandated by M back in MI6's London headquarters, and knocks Bond into a river. This leads beautifully to the macabre Saul Bass-inspired title sequence underscored by Adele's sonorous vocals.

Meanwhile, MI6 is under siege and goes underground when Bond finally resurfaces rattled by his near-death experience. Given a Walther PPK and tracking device by a new post-adolescent Q, Bond travels to Shanghai to confront the elusive target again in an exciting mano-a-mano fight. He is led by a sexy enigmatic woman named Severine to Silva, an ex-MI6 agent-turned-cyber-terrorist hell bent on revenge against M for sacrificing him on an espionage mission during the Hong Kong hand-off. As Silva starts killing off the agents identified on the disc, he arrives in London with the intent of publicly executing M, so Bond escapes with her to his childhood manor in the Scottish Highlands which gives the film its name. The story up to this point is genuinely thrilling, but by the time we get to the climax at Skyfall, the movie loses steam and most essentially, creative invention. It becomes an over-the-top conflagration in more ways than one leading to an inevitably fatalistic encounter in a chapel.

What also struck me about this movie was the scarcity of Bond girls - only two, neither of whom figures in the climax - but then it dawned on me that Mendes and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan have really set up M as the ultimate Bond girl. Judi Dench has far more screen time in this film than in her other appearances, and she allows us a glimpse behind the starchy Machiavellian mother figure she has played so adroitly. As Silva, Javier Bardem sports another bad haircut (and a dye job this time) to play a Bond villain that balances precariously between menacing and campy. His fey manner and come-on scene with Bond are amusing enough, but the disjointed nature of his role comes from the fact that his vengeance is directed far more at M, not Bond. Eurasian French actress Brnice Marlowe is stunning as Severine but only has one critical scene that allows her to show any dimension, while Naomie Harris (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B000VDDWEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>) lends comely grit to Eve even if mainly on the sidelines.

In an extended cameo that seems to beg for the return of Sean Connery (who would have been too distracting had he been cast), an almost unrecognizable Albert Finney plays Kincade, the resourceful gameskeeper of the Skyfall estate, in avuncular fashion. Ralph Fiennes shows up as an intelligence officer with the authority to determine the future of MI6, but it's clear his character is being set up for the next entry in the series. Joining Connery on the pantheon of 007s, Craig is really making his interpretation of Bond uniquely his own as the super-agent goes through what amounts to a mid-life crisis. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has provided expert lens work to previous Mendes projects like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B002DJROQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>, captures the richness of the exotic locales - Shanghai, Macao, Istanbul, a deserted island in ruins, and even the Scottish highlands - with fluid dexterity. The film runs long at 143 minutes, especially since the last half-hour does not keep up the momentum built up to that point. The more important takeaway, however, is that the film is successful in whetting one's appetite for the 24th installment in the series.",1353715200,7,4529,5.457917261055635

5036455,2,B006X040NY,"I've seen all the Bond movies (except for the spoof ""Casino Royale""), and I've read all the Fleming-authored Bond books.  And I have to say that ""Skyfall"" was a profoundly disappointing entry in the Bond canon.  Maybe that's because it's nothing like any of the other Bond movies:

-""Skyfall"" drags at times, greatly to the detriment of the story...classic Bond movies never have this problem.

-""Skyfall"" features far too much of Judith Dench...I know that the plot centered around sins from her past but that's what's wrong with it.  This is supposed to be a James Bond movie, not an ""M"" movie.

-""Skyfall"" is unpleasantly grim (like its immediate predecessor ""Quantum of Solace"" which was also dreadful).  The few fleeting attempts at humor are so isolated, they fall flat.

-""Skyfall"" also suffers from what Roger Ebert calls ""the idiot plot"" problem (i.e. the plot only makes sense if the people in the story are all idiots)

<spoilers>

What do I mean by that?  Well, if the head of the British Secret Service is being stalked by someone, taking her to a remote estate in Scotland where there is only Bond to protect her (along with a cliched servant character) is the worst thing possible to do.

""Skyfall"" is also arguably the first Bond movie where the villain triumphs.  He wanted to kill ""M.""  Bond kills him before he can blow M and his own brains out.  M then succumbs to the wounds she suffered earlier in the story.  So evil did triumph in the end.

<end spoilers>

I don't want to be totally negative here.  Daniel Craig does a good Bond (I really liked his debut in ""Casino Royale"" (the non-spoof version)).  The movie has some spectacular scenery...especially the Macau casino Bond visits.  But that's about it",1353715200,28,1728,4.750841750841751

5036457,5,B006X040NY,"Recently watched movie review:
*Skyfall (2012)- 5/5

Skyfall is the 23rd spy film in the James Bond Series and also celebrates its 50th year as a series. It stars 'Daniel Craig' for the 3rd time as James Bond, also known as 007, and 'Javier Bardem' as Raoul Silva, as the new villain for the series. The film was directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, John Logan, and Robert Wade.

An unknown terrorist blows up MI6 headquarters and is revealing the names of undercover operatives. James Bond must track down and destroy the threat, while 'M' (Judi Dench), who's' the Head of Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), comes under political pressure to retire. Skyfall is the 3rd movie I've seen in the series along with one that stared 'Pierce Brosnan' as James Bond and Casino Royale that also starred 'Daniel Craig.'

Since I've only seen 3 bond movies (2 with the same actor), I can't compare who's the better bond, and since I haven't read the books, I don't even know what to expect from 'Bond.' I mentioned that I saw a James Bond movie that starred 'Pierce Brosnan', but I don't remember that movie at all. I reviewed Skyfall by comparing it to Casino Royale as well as its own film.

From the very beginning I feared that my same complaint with Casino Royale would happen again in Skyfall; a 15-20 minute chase without anything really being explained, but alas, more explaining was done in Skyfall thus making this 15-20 minute chase actually enjoyable. After the chase, the opening credits roll with 'Adele' singing her new hit 'Skyfall,' and while the credits were rolling, I knew that this movie was going to have some tremendous value.

Skyfall is visually stunning from the landmarks to the special effects. The movie is filled with talent, and 'Javier Bardem' does an awesome job as the sadistic lunatic. The action sequences are expertly done and the closing scene is close to being perfect if the series were to end today. The fight scenes are easy to follow and the cinematography is outstanding. Compared to Casino Royale, Skyfall seemed to have less action and more narrative, which I found satisfying. I wasn't pumped to go see Skyfall as I'm clearly not a James Bond fanboy, but after seeing it once, I'm pumped to see it again. Skyfall gets a highly recommended 'rent.'",1353628800,7,2296,4.7443609022556394
5036458,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig has created a classic Bond that is perfect for our times.  A wonderful actor who can do more with his eyes and reactions than most actors can do with a page of dialogue.  He has a complete understanding of the Bond character and what makes him an essential hero. Skyfall works on every level, action, dramatic tension, depth of character, great actors, beautifully shot and directed.  If you prefer invisible cars, CGI, smug acting and grade-school level quips, you might not get it.

This time round, there's not a single woman that would make Bond the envy of any man!  What a total letdown!  A very disappointing anniversary affair.

5036461,5,B006X040NY,"After the Quantum of Solace mess, James Bond scores with Skyfall.  Here's why:

2. The locales were stunning.  Brilliantly filmed.

3. Great action sequences.

4. Different type of Bond film.  Very unique style.  Does not rely heavily on gadgets.

I got hooked on the Bond films back in the early 1980's.  Home Box Office (HBO) would air a Bond film once a month.  This was before For Your Eyes Only came out.

Connery was definitely the best, but Craig comes in a close second.

Skyfall definitely ranks as one of the top 10 Bond films.",1353369600,5,726,4.5271317829457365
5036462,5,B006X040NY,"I grew up with Sean Connery as ""Bond...James Bond..."" and he will always be Bond to me more than any other actor.  However, Daniel Craig is rapidly growing on me as my second favorite Bond of all time.  I enjoyed the first two Craig movies, but this one was brilliant!  It went deeper into the character than in a long time, and revealed bits of his past that were not only believable, but shed light on many aspects of his internal character.

The opening action scene speeds by and is rough and tumble fighting and chasing as good as any previously done.  But it ends with Bond DEAD (or so everyone thinks) and MI6 under an all too personal attack.  Bond returns from his ""vacation"" of drinking and womanizing (as if he would be up to anything else!) out of shape, shaken, not too sure of himself, and tying to hide the fact that he is definitely not ready to go back to duty.  From that point...what we see is an exercise in trust and loyalty as we can't help but compare Bond with the bad guy rogue agent.  What makes one man break and one man continue on against all odds?  What makes one man strong and another man go mad?  Silva and Bond are two sides of the same coin--smart, savvy, killers who ended up on very different paths.

What really makes Bond tick deep down inside?  Where does his deep sense of loyalty of country and love-hate relationship with M come from?  It will all become clear by the ruthless and heart-wrenching final battle of the movie.

I can't wait to see where they take this Bond next...Skyfall has deepened my love and affection for James Bond like no movie in a long time.  Best of all, what they have added to the character rings utterly true.  It's like stumbling across a gem that you never noticed before, like re-discovering what you felt when you first read one of Ian Fleming's books.

5036464,5,B006X040NY,"5 Stars = Masterpiece

As I was born in 1960, & my father was a huge fan of James Bond, both the books & films. James Bond is amongst my earliest memories of movies. I grew up loving & idolizing 007. As a young boy, who would not want to be the man to win all the battles & save the world? As a teenager, who would not want to be the man who got all the girls? Yes, James Bond was the man, no doubt about it. Sean Connery's (the best Bond) smooth & suave demeanor, was the definition of virility & sophistication that just about every man wished he could be. George Lazenby's physical approach to Bond, & apt portrayal was promissing, but faced the insurmountable task in following Connery. He was given maybe the best Bond film ever made (certainly if Connery was Bond), but was highly maligned. One has to wonder how he would of molded the role had he choose to play Bond more than once? Roger Moore's tongue in cheek portrayal of Bond, which later turned more into him sticking his tongue out at the audience, while he blatantly winked away. Timothy Dalton's quietly sincere interpretation of 007, which I thought was a very good Bond, but maybe to sincere after Moore's bastardization of his later Bond films. Pierce Bronson, the man who I felt never quite fit in the role, then given later films that would further 007's downhill surmise.

Then there is Danial Craig! Not since Sean Connery has there been a Bond so all commanding of his screen presence, & hence, the silver screen it's self. Craig, who looked at first glance to be an unlikely & unwise choice for Bond, after the succession of pretty boys with their pretty gadgets, as the superspy. Danial Craig who made Bond believable again, through pure physical charisma & an acting ability far above any other Bond since Connery, in fact, he rivals Connery in many ways. Craig whose tough as steel persona & physique, yet a vulnerability underlying his commanding presence. A Bond driven by past torments, who only lets you see glimpses of his core nature. The coldest killing machine of a Bond that ever was, but yet a warmth inhabits his performance.

If there was a doubt that anything I just wrote about Daniel Craig is true, it surely has been put to rest & cemented by his latest film ""Skyfall."" The most intimately personal look at James Bond ever given a houseful of Bond lovers at the theater, with possibly the exception of the last 10 minutes of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Here Bond is stripped naked of all his armor, to show us a man who has been tormented all his life in one form or another. Here is Bond, a man unsure of himself, looking for resurrection & redemption, & here he finds it all in one film, ""Skyfall.""

""Skyfall"" is certainly one of the greatest Bond films ever, it has all the action & intrigue of the best Bond. Yet, one can not compare it to other great Bond films such as ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Goldfinger,"" ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" & Craig's own superb, ""Casino Royal."" For it is a different breed of Bond, letting us inside his secretive world. Even it's villain ""Silva,"" Javier Bardem's (""No Country for Old Men"") tremendously maniacal performance as a man driven by psychotic revenge, is another door unlocked to the secret world of the 00's. His villain certainly is the most complex of any Bond film. His acting unquestionably the greatest of anyone to play a Bond villain. Even Telly Savalas as ""Blofeld, & Gret Frobe as ""Goldfinger,"" fall to Javier's, ""Silva."" Finally, Judi Dench's ""M,"" is the third door that opens in this most revealing of all Bond films. Her tough as nails persona gets deconstructed brick by brick, board by board. She mirrors the self crisis that Bond is experiencing, am I all that I was, or seem to be? Can I overcome all that I fear?

So here it is, a film like no other Bond film ever made. A film of self doubt. A film of self reliance. A film of determination to overcome any obstacle in one's way. At once an intimate film, but that is huge in it's execution, drive, suspense, & thrills. A film with a few surprises not mentioned here, & lastly, a film that will secure Daniel Craig's place as a great Bond, & the making of more Bond films in the foreseeable future!",1353283200,4,4221,4.505221932114883
5036465,3,B006X040NY,"In this latest and most slapdash chapter in the re-envisioned James Bond saga, a hackneyed revenge plot is given such thin treatment that one wonders why it was approved for production.  Any film featuring Daniel Craig, especially as James Bond, will always be watchable to some degree, of course.  This movie, sadly, simply doesn't do the same justice to Craig/Bond (or even exist in the same universe, really) as the two which went before.  There isn't enough genuine Bond-movie material here to fill an after-school special.  (I will omit a full description of even the basics of the plot, to avoid spoiling it for readers who have not seen the movie, and will only discuss certain bits below.)

Raoul Silva, though as well-played by Javier Bardem as possible, is in the end as thinly imagined and incredible as the rest of the story (Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre-- now, there was a villain!).  Sure, he's got a beef with M and her utilitarian ways.  Past that, he's completely cartoonish and unrealistic: one of the world's top six cryptanalysts who nevertheless has a taste for wet work?  Really?  Nor are his exploits in the least believable.  Purely fantastic computer shenanigans are juxtaposed with sheer logistical impossibilities.  For example-- even if one could get past all the misunderstandings of computer science that lead up to Silva's escape from his MI6 underground incarceration-- for Silva to have prepared an explosive charge in the subway tunnels just to send a train hurtling at Bond, enabling Silva to skedaddle up a ladder to safety, is sheer silliness.  Even if genius-badass Silva has memorized the London tram schedule and is up on all the latest delays, the timing required means that no proper genius-badass would rely on this as a defense mechanism.  Silva might as well have asked Bond to move two feet to the right to stand on a black painted X.

Instead of showing understated cool as in the last two movies, the writers' and director's attempts to use technology to spice things up in ""Skyfall"" result in frequent, unmitigated hogwash.  Movies such as ""Iron Man"" have apparently strengthened the holographic-computer-interface trope to such a degree that no hack screenwriter would be caught dead using a character to control a computer by any other means.  Not only must the computer be controlled in this way under the new regime, but it must be obvious to the viewer that a lot more is being accomplished this way than it would be with a traditional keyboard and mouse.  This gives rise in ""Skyfall"" to the rare treat of an alleged mathematician actually wrestling with a recalcitrant bit of encrypted data which actively resists him-- as if he could be inputting enough data in this way to actually decrypt anything, instead of using massively more powerful computer programs to do the necessary analysis and crunching-- and in the end the genius-encoded data is unraveled by Bond's noticing a plain-text word floating about in the data.  In other words, Silva's world-class encryption scheme is roughly as secure as cryptographic methods literally available in the time of Julius Caesar.  Any attempts to explain this away as an intentional trap of Silva's would be just as stupid, since someone of Q's alleged caliber would be expected to be skeptical of such an easy entry.

There are so many problems with this scenario and other computer-related ones in the movie that simply remembering them gives rise to a migraine.  Now-humdrum asymmetric encryption techniques used  in every modern e-commerce shopping cart are worlds more secure than genius Silva's scheme.  Nor is it credible that Silva's gambit to hack MI6's ENTIRE NETWORK (without any built-in internal safeguards, apparently) by use of his own laptop being decrypted on-network by the hapless Q, would need to be triggered by someone recognizing an open-text phrase and triggering his malware.  MI6, in this bravely imagined new Bond cyberverse, ought to at least invest in a modern antivirus program, and maybe even invest in some sort of safe room where a COMPUTER OWNED BY THE WORLD'S FOREMOST CYBERTERRORIST COULD BE EXAMINED WITHOUT GIVING IT ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE NETWORK.  Nor is it possible for static data to actively resist attempts to decrypt it.  In any event, modern data forensics examinations begin by saving an image of the data to be examined, just in case something goes awry and the data is corrupted or deleted.

Unfortunately, the extraordinary clunkiness of ""Skyfall"" doesn't end with this techy garbage; there are many other instances of clumsy plotting throughout the movie.  For example, in the big battle scene at Skyfall manor, when the gamekeeper attempts to hurry M to safety, Raoul Silva reacquires the pair because of the FLASHLIGHT BEAM BOBBING ACROSS THE MOORS-- despite the glare from the exploding and burning manor house which well illuminates the entire surrounding landscape.  How idiotic would one have to be to give away one's location in such circumstances?  And wouldn't Bond have been better off taking at least a few other agents with him to his retreat in the first place-- I mean, especially since he was trying to leave an obvious trail for Silva to follow?  Even as a man's man-- who believes in doing things himself, with an especial yen for diving without backup behind the wheel of old movie-prop cars to spray a few bullets, [ without any credible way of getting out of there afterwards-- did he really have to rely on a hunting rifle and a couple of moldy sticks of dynamite, when he could have had the pick of MI6's entire arsenal on his way out to the old homestead?

My seven year old child employs better strategic thinking than this.  This sort of special ""Skyfall"" stupidity is not explainable by Bond's tendency to go full-tilt into a situation, counting on his wits and the element of surprise to help things come out right.  No, this was carefully considered stupidity based on Bond's years of experience in top-flight agentry.  In reality, of course, what happened was this: the screenwriter imagined a final confrontation involving just Bond, M, and Silva, and a big cast of characters and a bunch of believable weaponry and agent-fu would just have gotten in the way.  The screenwriter must have written that whole last booby-trap battle fresh off of a drunken marathon watching of the entire ""Home Alone"" franchise (including the straight-to-videos), and took the most straightforward route towards getting Bond and M out in the country with few resources: simply driving them straight there without any attempt at real explanation.

There are also deplorably hokey in-jokes scattered throughout the movie.  For instance, the Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger, cheesy machine guns and all, is used as an actual important element in the defense of Skyfall manor.  This is a far cry from the few references in Casino Royale (e.g. ""Do I look like I give a damn?"") that strongly signaled that this new Bond was not the smarmy cocktail-party jokester of old, but an entirely new creature.  The old Aston Martin and other gadgets, as well as some other touches, instead herald somewhat of a return to the Bond of old.  If so, legions of fans of the new, gritty Daniel Craig version stand to be sorely disappointed.

Here's hoping that future installments in the franchise show the same attention to freshness, artistry and detail that distinguished both ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace"".  As it is, for ""Skyfall"" to be mentioned in the same breath as the ""Casino Royale"" remake is a travesty of good taste.  ""Skyfall"" is most certainly not the best movie in the franchise, although from the frequency of that assertion, one wonders what particular brand of crack is making the rounds of Hollywood's critical circles these days.  My advice: if you haven't seen this movie, rent it at the Redbox (on DVD, to save a few pennies) to satisfy your curiosity, and have done with it.",1353196800,6,7946,4.9547852298417485
5036466,5,B006X040NY,"When MGM/UA/Columbia made the decision to reboot one of their most important but faltering franchises with 2006's CASINO ROYALE, James Bond had become vital again. A decidedly more modern storytelling approach to the character with a whole new and edgier Bond (Daniel Craig) in the mix helped to create possibly the best Bond film of all time. It set a new standard that future Bond films would have to live up to. Gone were the super-duper futuristic gadgetry and groan-inducing double entendres and one-liners. Bond was finally ready to exit the realm of self-parody that the series had embraced readily since the Roger Moore days and even more firmly with the last few Pierce Brosnan films, and present us with a much grittier and deadlier, but alternately more human Bond; a Bond more comfortable with the assassin aspects of having a Double-O rating, but carrying with him something deeper behind those icy blue eyes. The series seemed to become more of a character study rather than the usual cavalcade of Bond Girls, cars that turn into submarines, boom boxes that became rocket launchers and massive underground volcano bases. This was now a Bond for the 21st Century. Sadly, the potential for this new direction felt somewhat squandered when it came to Craig's second Bond film QUANTUM OF SOLACE, which had the dubious honor of being the only Bond film that was a direct sequel to the previous film. Suddenly, the fact that it was a Bond film felt incidental and it just didn't work. Then the powers that be behind the franchise decided, much to their great benefit, that getting an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, Sam Mendes, to helm their next adventure was a good idea, and this gave us, on the 50th anniversary of Bond's cinematic career, SKYFALL, which is pretty much the quintessential Bond film that blends the new sensibilities of the character and storytelling combined with a great affection for many of the things that make Bond... James Bond the icon he is.

The film opens with a pre-credits sequence that is heart-pounding and heart-stopping as Bond, along with fellow MI-6 agent Eve (Naomie Harris), pursue a man with a stolen computer hard drive, the contents of which are unknown to us at this time. The pursuit goes from car chase to rooftop motorcycle chase to on top of a moving train where a judgment call by M (Judi Dench, reprising her role for the seventh time) gets Bond shot, plummetting to his presumed death, and allows the bad guy to get away. Back at MI-6, M gets caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare as Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), a seeming stuffed shirt for The Ministry of Defence steps in to announce that the drive that was stolen not only contained the list of every NATO deep cover agent in the world, but that the contents of that drive could be released and that this will all fall on M's head. In another part of the world, Bond is still alive, spending his time ""enjoying death"" as he beds women, engages in dangerous behavior, but he seems amused really by none of it. Soon, an explosion rocks MI-6 headquarters, resulting in the deaths of several agents and Bond decides that it's time to return home. After a series of rigorous physical and psychological tests seem to show that perhaps Bond is no longer fit for duty, M announces that he's clear and assigns him to find whoever's responsible for this attack, but one more thing is needed to complete the package: Bond needs to meet the new Quartermaster (or just ""Q"", if you prefer), a maybe-too-young moppy-haired computer genius (Ben Whishaw). The trail leads him to a number of exotic locales, a few battles, and then finally into the clutches of Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent and expert hacker with a VERY serious grudge against M. The tensions mount as Bond desperately fights the machinations of Silva and races to save and protect M, which then leads to a final showdown at a mysterious but very important place called Skyfall.

The most unusual thing about this film is that, while watching it, I felt there were moments that dragged a bit at the beginning of the second act, but when revisiting it in my mind, I realized that these were moments we normally don't get in Bond films; moments of character development. The arc that Bond is given here is something that shows part of who he really is, partly in his lack of purpose during periods of inaction, his fear of losing his identity as a Double-O, and particularly in his relationship to M. To that end, Craig gives possibly his best performance to date, and firmly owns the character of James Bond. Dench again brings wit, humanity and gravitas to M, and also gives her best outing in this series. Fiennes sadly doesn't have a great deal to do, but when he does, he gives Mallory a refined pragmatic exterior but still a dangerous edge and is a welcome addition to the franchise. Whishaw is not quite the meta geek that one might expect in the post-modern self-referential age we live in, but in the scenes he has, he plays them with enthusiasm, some playfulness, but a surprising seriousness for someone of his age, demonstrating that he is definitely not too young to be Q. Harris as Eve and Berenice Lim Marlohe as Severine are the beautiful Bond Girls this time around, and they both put in considerable work despite the somewhat limited screentime they may have. The great Albert Finney comes in kind of late to the proceedings, but is great fun to watch.

The absolute star (from an acting standpoint, anyway) of the film though is Bardem, a famously chameleonic actor, and he slips into the somewhat tragic evil of Silva with the ease of a master actor deeply at home. His introduction is something of legend and is unlike that of any Bond villain I could recall. With his dyed blonde hair and eyebrows and his effeminate affectations and demonically playful humor, Bardem makes another case for being one of the best actors working today. The best comparison that I can make to his performance and the character is that of Heath Ledger's Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT. His plan is so many steps ahead of everyone else, but everything he does, no matter how destructive, has this hint of sick humor and glee to it. Silva is less of a villain as he is an agent of fate.

But it could be argued that the most important ingredient of this brilliant mix is Sam Mendes. From doing more ""high-brow"" films such as AMERICAN BEAUTY to ROAD TO PERDITION (ironically, Daniel Craig's first American film) to REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, he seemed like a very unlikely choice to helm a major franchise action/adventure film, but as it turns out, like Brad Bird on the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise, J.J. Abrams on STAR TREK and Christopher Nolan on the BATMAN films, Mendes could not have been more right to make this film. Taking the script by mainstays Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who have been working on the series together since THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH), but bringing in new blood in writer John Logan (GLADIATOR, THE LAST SAMURAI, as well as Fiennes' directorial debut COROLANIUS), they bring an old-school feel with simple things like giving Bond back his Walther PPK (with the new twist of being coded to Bond's palmprint so that only he can fire it) to a reveal of an absolute classic Bond car. But perhaps the most important thing that Mendes brings is the sensibilty of being an actor's director. He understands that in order to make a great film, you have to have great characters, and here, he gets to play with many of the most iconic characters of the Bond mythology, and is able to make all of them seem fully fleshed out. With a key assist from cinematographer Roger Deakins, this team created what will more than likely come to be viewed as the archetype for what a great Bond film should be: High-flying, globe-trotting adventure with luscious landscapes and some extraordinary set pieces, but keeping the characters grounded in real human motivations that allow the audience to truly relate to their heroes (as well as the villains, in this film's case).

SKYFALL has entered into the arena of the greatest of the Bond films by being very smart, extraordinarily well-made, extremely well-acted, but packed with enough of the charm and joy and excitement that only James Bond can bring.

I also kinda liked the Adele song, too. That's saying a lot.",1353196800,11,8336,4.72971114167813
5036467,2,B006X040NY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  This is Daniel Craig's third performance as James Bond--why can't it be his last? Craig is a decent actor who should never have been cast as James Bond in the first place. He's certainly excellent when it comes to the physical requirements of the job as it appears he doesn't shy away from giving it his all in the action scenes. But he exudes little wit which is a key component of this iconic role. This is borne out by Craig's reported professed desire to have his contract bought out since he's been quoted as saying that he finds acting as James Bond to be ""boring"".

  For a James Bond film to be successful, it needs the three g's (Good girls, gadgets and a Goldfinger). Skyfall pretty much fails in all three departments. Take the 'girls' for instance. Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny is quite pleasant to look at but is given little to do here as agent in the field turned secretary. Initially, we're led to believe that she'll be an integral part of the plot, Bond's 'point man' in the exciting chase scene where he battles mercenary/assassin Patrice on top of a speeding train. After botching the shot that takes out Bond instead of Patrice (how Bond survives the shot and subsequent fall off a bridge is never really explained), Eve is relegated to office work and has little more direct interaction with Bond for the rest of the film.

  Then there's B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Lim Marlohe as S&eacute;v&eacute;rine, a concubine of sorts of the Skyfall villain, Raoul Silva. Unfortunately Marlohe does not get the opportunity to show her stuff as an independent 'Bond woman' as she is petrified of Silva and hints that she will soon meet her own demise. There is a perfunctory shower scene with Bond on her yacht which is mercifully short. The end comes rather quickly when Silva dispatches S&eacute;v&eacute;rine on the island with a bullet to the head. It would have been much more tasteful if Director Sam Mendes had chosen to depict the killing off screen but when has Sam Mendes ever been known for being tasteful?

  As far as gadgets, 'Skyfall' is even more disappointing in that department. The young and geeky Ben Wishaw, has now taken up the mantle of a modern day 'Q', the quartermaster of the MI6 spy service. He even spells it out quite succinctly when he tells Bond there are no fancy gadgets this time around. Instead, we're left with a miniature radio tracking device and a gun that will not fire unless it recognizes Bond's palm print. Q of course is a computer expert and he stands around trying to hack into bad guy's computer or prevent being hacked himself. The yawn factor is in full force as we've been privy to all this computer mumbo-jumbo, oh so many times before!

  Finally there's a 'Goldfinger': If the Bond antagonist is not larger than life, with the much needed ubiquitous charm, it's hardly likely that a Bond film can be truly successful. Unfortunately, Javier Bardem as the aforementioned Silva, hardly inspires confidence as a truly endearing Bond villain. Silva is merely a former MI6 agent who improbably was given up by M (Judi Dench) to the Chinese in exchange for a coterie of MI6 double agents. His goal is to take revenge on M as he blames her for his subsequent imprisonment and torture at the hands of MI6 opponents.

  For some reason, Silva acquires super powers of sorts after being released by the Chinese and now has the ability to hack into any computer, resulting first in the ridiculous theft of a list of all undercover NATO agents in terrorist organizations and subsequent bombing of MI6 headquarters itself. If that isn't absurd enough, computer genius Silva escapes from MI6 custody and then attacks politicians where M is giving testimony at a public inquiry.

  'Skyfall' of course does not refer to jumping out of a plane but rather, Bond's family estate where he grew up as a child. After Silva's failed try at assassinating M at the public inquiry, she decides the only way to capture the former agent is leave an electronic trail (facilitated by Q) where Silva can find her. Holed up at Skyfall is Bond, M and Kincade, the gamekeeper at the estate. Silva attacks in two waves: the first is a group of his henchmen, all wiped out by Bond and company, utilizing primitive weapons found inside the Bond mansion (how crazy Silva manages to get all his confederates to follow him, is a mystery to me). Silva then makes his grand appearance via a helicopter, which of course is shot down after Bond detonates a couple of gas canisters. Later, Bond falls through the ice and engages in a death struggle with Silva's last henchman. Like the earlier scene where he survives Eve's errant shot, it's unclear how Bond manages to extricate himself from the icy pond, after being submerged in icy water for so long.

  I suppose it is appropriate that Silva should meet his end not as a result of a technological advantage but simply due to the flick of an old-fashioned knife into the back. There are other satisfying moments in 'Skyfall' including some dazzling opening credits, a sultry opening number sung by Adele, the aforementioned Bond/Patrice fight on top of the speeding train, lovely panoramas shot in Istanbul and Shanghai, another unlikely but exciting train crash in the London Underground and the big fight to the death action scenes on the Skyfall estate.

  I have no idea whether Judi Dench also wanted out of her contract and it was her suggestion to finish off 'M' with her playing the role. Let's hope that Mr. Craig follows suit and the producers then conscript new writers and a director. With a new team, the next 'Bond' can be much better than this current hokey effort.",1353110400,11,5698,4.717741935483871
5036468,5,B006X040NY,"You are going to travel. London, Istanbul, Shanghai, Macao, and Scotland of course, the castle of Skyfall. And hurry up about it because Skyfall will be completely destroyed in the operation.

You have the stunts, the car hunts, the chases, and all the physical elements necessary in that film. Istanbul is one city splashed with this mission and that's the second time in three months, after Taken 2. But it is hardly really said. You recognize Turkey if you know it.  Shanghai is more in the tradition of Bourne and his films. But no Eastern Europeans, not even Moscow nor Berlin. That is rather clean after all. The main damage is in London and Scotland. They even cut the Eiffel Tower out, but not Big Ben.

The British respect their borders and like their country. We are speaking of the MI6 of course but there is a big leak in the system and that leak does not come from outside but from inside, in fact from an agent who was one of the best, if not the best in his 1980-90 time, but he got caught and in the MI6, the famous M, the lady boss of the service, decided to trade him. When someone very faithful survives such a treacherous decision, you can expect difficulties.

And difficulties they got. But the main difficulty came from the government and Parliament who started criticizing the work of the service and the security of the country in the name of modern technology that should be used instead of secret agents and shadowy maneuvers. And no one has the courage to bring to light the simple facts. Yet this simple situation of a treacherous agent within the system is the main idea in this film: danger is not from outside but from inside and the solution can only come from inside too.

That's why this film is better than most other films in that field. It is not targeting foreign enemies but a national agent that turned bitter, sour, rotten, self-motivated by vengeance.

The point is not even to know whether he is going to get his vengeance or not, but how it is going to happen. And that you will have to look for it in the film. I hope you enjoy the marvellous Scottish castle that is destroyed like a house of cards built by kids.

5036469,5,B006X040NY,"Okay, so the title to my review is expected and stale, but that certainly doesn't describe the 23rd installment in the James Bond series. 50 years on, our secret service spy has never been more thrilling and interesting. It's the perfect film for such a monumental anniversary.

Without getting too spoilery, ""Skyfall"" has Bond resurrecting himself after a slam bang pre-credits sequence that finds 007's life up in the air. He reports back to duty when someone has attacked MI6. It seems someone has a top secret list that exposes the identities of agents out in the field, and it's someone who hits close to home with M (the amazing Dame Judi Dench).

Like many people my age, my introduction to Bond was Roger Moore. That's who I grew up with at first, but got to see Connery on TV and video. Connery was the best (and I have a soft spot for Pierce Brosnan as well), but it took me a while to warm up to Daniel Craig. 'Casino Royale' was a fine film and 'Quantum Of Solace' was a disaster. 'Skyfall' is Craig's third Bond film, but it's the first where it feels like he is finally a Bond that I can warm up to and put him right alongside the others. It's a movie that breaks the mold with 007, but also retains the classic elements of the franchise. It's also those classic moments that had the audience I saw with applauding the most. One only has to watch M's scene defending herself before the Prime Minister and her department to understand why we still need Bond and his services. The classics never go out of style.

I cannot stress enough how amazing the movie looks. Cinematograpger Roger Deakins has created the best looking Bond I have ever seen. If an Oscar isn't coming his way for this, then something is very wrong. In fact, the movie is Oscar-worthy in other areas. The music by Thomas Newman is phenomenal. The original stuff fits right in with the series while giving hints of the classic 007 theme here and there before really blaring it in a classic scene. Adele's theme song is one of the best ever. It's a ready made classic and Shirley Bassey-sounding that plays out over one of the best and more impressive opening credits ever. You also have a stellar cast. Javier Bardem as Silva is one of the most memorable villains in a Bond film in decades, possibly ever. He is unsettling. He goes from humorous to downright creepy in a blink of the eye. Truly a memorable presence. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Albert Finney are also new to the game. We finally get a new Q as well, in the guide of a young computer geek played by Ben Wishaw. However, this is Judi Dench's turn as THE Bond girl of the film. She has more of a part than ever before and she owns this film. It makes one wish they had used her more in her other 6 007 films. And Daniel Craig. He is finally James Bond in this one. Definitely his best. He makes Bond human and vulnerable like never before.

""Skyfall"" explores more about Bond's past than we have ever seen in a 007 movie. It does a good job of new revelations in a new age, but also keeps those classic hallmarks that we have all come to know and love in the series. You can't have Bond without them. ""Skyfall"" is exceptionally directed by Sam Mednes, who delivers not only one of the best Bond films, but one of the best action films I have seen in years. The stunts are magnificent, the action is breathtaking, the cinematography is beautiful, the music is amazing. ""Skyfall"" is Bond at his best.",1353024000,9,3449,4.418238993710692
5036470,5,B006X040NY,"After the disappointing Quantum of Solace and reading in 2008 that the new Bond project was placed on the shelves due to the global credit crisis, I honestly thought that we would be seeing the end of James Bond.  When I first heard about Skyfall, I figured that the movie would be a half hearted attempt to recapture Bond's glory days but I am very happy to say that I was completely wrong.  This was one of the best movies in Bond history.

Skyfall was much longer than other previous Bond films, however, the time flew by.  After the movie was finished, the audience actually stood up and gave the movie a standing ovation.  It is well worth the money to buy some tickets to watch this film!!",1352937600,12,695,4.3984375
5036471,5,B006X040NY,"""Skyfall"" is the latest James Bond movie, marking 50 years of the 007 franchise, which shows no signs of running out of gas.  The movie manages to be something different while still honoring the traditions of the series.  It has a plot with substance, built around a plausible and deadly threat to MI6, that plays out in an entirely serious manner, with the self-referential jokes kept to a minimum.  One leading character has to earn a way in; another is on the way out.

The movie offers themes of resurrection and renewal.  Bond goes missing in action after an assignment in Turkey goes badly, only to resurface when MI6 comes under attack.  ""M"" will be under immense pressure to resign after a major security compromise; she elects to stick it out to the bitter end.  An old enemy of the service turns out to have a complicated and conflicted backstory, and a very modern weapon.  Old-school violence turns out to be the solution to a 21st century problem...

Daniel Craig is on his third and best outing as Bond.  Judi Dench returns as ""M"".  Javier Bardem is a very talented actor, but his villain is rather overplayed.  Natalie Harris is Bond's partner in the field, a role with conflicted loyalties.  Ralph Fiennes is Gareth Mallory, the stuffy liaison to Parliament, with some surprises up his sleeve.  The movie digs deep into Bond's past for its final dramatic setting in Scotland.  The action sequences are on a more human scale, and more believable and frightening for it.  Highly recommended.",1352851200,,1505,4.775193798449612

If you saw the first James Bond movie, ""Dr. No."" in a movie theater when it first came out....it was fifty years ago!

I just saw Skyfall...and I did not think it was one of the best.

Why? It was somewhat disjointed...there were many stretches where not much was going on...and the plot didn't make all that much sense in the long run. That being said, Daniel Craig is still one of the best Bonds (I think Connery was the best)..the familiar music is great...and it's still all in good fun. I don't regret seeing it.

I'd say the weakness in this film was in the writing and editing.

So should you see this movie? Sure. Go ahead. Like all the Bond movies there is great scenery, the acting is just fine, and everything is larger than life. There are lots of fights, there is lots of gun fire, there are lots of explosions, and there is a great chase scene.

But if you are looking for a terrific story line, with lots of twists and turns, and where everything makes a lot of sense look elsewhere.",1352851200,6,1027,4.322916666666667
5036473,3,B006X040NY,"I rated this movie three stars mostly for the action scenes which there aren't enough of, otherwise I would have rated it two stars.  The usual big, unique, opening scene in the Bond movies doesn't materialize, we get an old hat car chase instead.  I don't know if the Broccoli's are getting ready to dump Daniel Craig as Bond, but several comments are made by his superiors regarding his aging and his retirement as a field agent which puts a damper on this film from the start. There are too many boring scenes where no action takes place and nothing interesting is happening. I'm not a Daniel Craig as Bond fan, he cannot carry off the debonaire, sophisticated Bond with the ladies, and he mumbles with a low voice, making it difficult to hear what he is saying at times. The witty quips Bond usually makes to the ladies are absent, adding boredom to the film. The villain looks like a big, buffoon, cartoon character who didn't fit the part. The screenwriting isn't very good, the dialogue sounded juvenile at times. The ending scene at Skyfall is ridiculous and so far fetched that it is laughable. The last criticism I have is for the theme song ""Skyfall, sung by Adele, it is worse than terrible. I have some advice for the Broccoli's, Daniel Craig is not working as Bond, this film did not work, go back to the drawing board and retire Daniel Craig, get a hot looking, youthful actor (such as a David Beckham look-alike)who will appeal to both young and older viewers, surround him with new technology/stunts/current music, get better screenwriting, and you might get a great film.",1352851200,7,1589,4.671428571428572
5036474,3,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig's haggard, wrinkled, dropping face says much about ""Skyfall"" and the James Bond persona.  After fifty years, James Bond has become a very old and tired cliche, a character borne of the racist British imperial patriarchy that still lives and breathes well in Mayfair, London and Victoria Peak, Hong Kong, but has thankfully passed away in the rest of the modern world.  In today's world, it's hard to justify why James Bond fights, and nearly impossible to create a compelling conflict that captures our imagination.  If John Le Carre couldn't find a cause worth fighting for after the Cold War, then neither could James Bond.

But, alas, the show must continue.  In today's spy movies, thanks to the Bourne movies, exotic locales, parkour, motorcycle chases on rooftops, train collisions are de rigueur, and we get all that in the first ten minutes.  So for the next unbearably long two hours we'll left to deal with the existentialist angst of James Bond and M16, as they force to justify and explain their existence in an increasingly skeptical world.  Needless to say, James Bond does not and cannot do so, and so instead just goes drinking, gambling, whoring, and killing -- and when all the gratuitous violence is all done he and M16 are newly resurrected, and all the inquiry and skepticism have all gone away.

""Skyfall"" is an incredibly stupid movie, but somehow in its ponderousness and pretentiousness it seems to have hit its mark.",1352764800,,1455,4.910204081632653

I don't want to give away any of the plot, so just take my word and go see this in the theatre...you will not be disappointed. The effects and fight sequences are amazing. The film also shows us another new side of Bond and dips into his past a bit, which is fascinating. I was not thrilled about the casting of Naomie Harris as one of the Bond girls, but thankfully she isn't nearly as annoying as she is in the ""Pirates"" movie franchise, and I love the revelation about her character at the end of the film...didn't see that coming! Javier Bardem has made a name for himself as one of the best Bond villains of all time. His character is a throwback to the evil Bond antagonists of yore, which was just so fun to watch unfold on screen. The one thing that may disappoint viewers is that, of all the Bond films I can remember, I think James has the least amount of sex in this one, but that's because the main Bond girl in this film is M.

5036476,5,B006X040NY,"Skyfall is in some ways the logical culmination of the Bond reboot with Daniel Craig. It focuses much more on plot and character than almost any other Bond film I can recall. There's much to love about the film. However, ultimately Skyfall is hampered by its inability to completely break with the past. Here are some thoughts:

THE GOOD

Brilliant directing. There are some scenes, such as the Shanghai skyscraper, that make excellent use of lighting and locale. Great camera angles, such as the shots of Bond going through the tests. The film is generally well paced and never too predictable.

The acting is superb for a Bond movie. Daniel Craig's Bond really comes across as a three-dimensional character. He's a very real person facing very real emotional struggles. We learn a bit about Bond's history and where he grew up. Moreover, Judi Dench as M finally becomes a character, not just a face behind a desk. The movie takes both characters and elaborates upon the themes of aging gracefully. It generally works well

Again, Skyfall is a Bond film, not an Indie movie. However, at times it seems to be reaching for something greater than simply yet another Bond film.

THE BAD

Skyfall reaches so high and generally succeeds. But in a few areas it struggles to reconcile its status as a Bond film with the director's obviously grander vision. This is particularly true in how it handles the villain and the women.

*** SPOILER ALERT ***

The Villain, played by Javier Bardem, is an ex-MI6 agent who has become disillusioned with the secret service and furious at M for handing him over to the Chinese. The motivation seems a bit silly and overworn (basically like Trevelyn in Goldeneye). Unfortunately, Bardem's Villain comes across as too flamboyant and omnipotent for an otherwise serious film. Like the worst of Bond villains, he's omnipotent and omniscient. He has a hacking program that gives him access to any computer in the world. He seems able to plan everything and anything in advance and apparently has infiltrated the London police at the highest levels. How he does this of course is unknown. It comes across as lazy scriptwriting (note to future scriptwriters: the super-duper hacker program is not interesting or threatening, it's boring and over-used). Bardem's character never plunges to the ridiculous depths of Moonraker's tycoon, but nor does he stand out as particularly interesting.

A bigger problem with the movie is the female roles - aside from M. There are two potential Bond girls. We get a new actress for Moneypenny who starts off as a field agent and then switches to a desk job. The character has potential in the beginning, but then there's an awkward scene when she starts flirting with Bond, with cringe-inducing lines like ""sometimes the old ways are the best."" She drops out of the film about halfway through. Second, Bardem's mistress has a brief conversation with Bond. Next thing you know, he sneaks into the shower with her. Talk about quick!

For both Bond girls the females never came across as strong or interesting characters. When the Bond films focused on guns, girls, and gadgets, the ease with which women fell to Bond's charms was funny. It fit with the spirit of the film. Bond films were part of the joke. However, in Skyfall, they seem out of place. Neither female seems equal to Craig's Bond. Fortunately, M as the motherly figure makes up for the glaring lack of a strong female, but I hope the next film finds a strong female character.

CONCLUSION

Overall 4.5 stars. Skyfall is definitely worth seeing for Bond fans and will appeal to most fans of action films. It's possibly the best Bond film ever and I'm encouraged by the direction of the franchise. Not perfect, but very good.",1352764800,4,3747,4.846635367762128
5036477,5,B006X040NY,"It was rumored over the last two years that the Bond series was in trouble and after 22 films and nearly five decades, the end of Bond would have been heartbreaking. Daniel Craig's bond was a different cut from Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. He was meaner and less capable of making fun of himself. The Bond series has always adapted with the culture and the current situation of the world, but the current world wasn't ready to make light of terrorism.

 Bond always was more than gadgets and action. He seemed to do his job with a smile and cockiness that somebody who knew they were gonna win would wear. Well, thank goodness that the 23rd film of the series was made and this year, 2012, is the 50th anniversary of the longest running and most successful film franchise. ""Skyfall"" proves that it is much deserved.

 The moment that the movie begins, you hear that hint of the familiar Bond theme song and the most ejects you into a breathtaking, intense and amazingly filmed chase scene. Nothing needs to be explained. With the words of M (Judi Dench), nestled away at England's Mi6, you understand the importance of the target. It was an early sign that the screenplay was going to be spectacular. As good as the opening sequence is, it is a shadow of what the movie holds for its viewers.

 One of the most amazing things about ""Skyfall"" is how quality of an action movie it is. The Director, Sam Mendes, had done smaller movies like ""American Beauty"", ""Road to Perdition"", ""Revolutionary Road"" and ""Away We Go"", but ""Skyfall"" is a whole other entity. Possibly the use of Mendes was a highly successful attempt to not only get a beautifully filmed movie and a quality one, but also a Bond grounded in reality. Never once did the movie exceed that realm of possibility. Bond doesn't leap off of a cliff and jump into a plummeting helicopter, or slide on a motorcycle under a helicopter blade chopping into the ground or do anything superhuman. He's a man and the first thing that ruins a good action movie is an audience member who roles their eyes.

 The effects are real. The stunt work is top notch. Daniel Craig, in fact, did a lot of his own stunts, adding to the films realism. The screenplay is fantastic and rich like a Bond movie should be. The Director, Mendes, may have not done much action in his career, but I have a feeling he may have just added a new wrinkle to his resume.

 Easily, ""Skyfall"" is the best movie that Daniel Craig has been in and if you forget about the fact that 1962's ""Dr. No"", 1964's ""Goldfinger"" or Roger Moore's best ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", had less technology to work with and still made great films, ""Skyfall"" is the best of the entire series. Then to take it a bit further, it may be the best action movie since ""Die Hard"", ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Lethal Weapon"". Like those films, ""Skyfall"" proves that keeping action movies grounded in reality and letting the audience know the man behind it, with all his flaws and quirks is a winning combination. Don't miss it.",1352764800,7,3022,4.538602941176471
5036478,5,B006X040NY,"Everything I heard about this film made me think I would hate it. I don't like Judy Dench in James Bond films. I don't like films about cyber-terrorism. I don't like films that dwell on the personal lives of James Bond and M. I went it with complete doubt and the film won me over. Everything I expected to be bad was done exceptionally well. They avoided every film cliche and kept things true to the character of Bond.

Daniel Craig continues to have an incredible presence on screen as Bond. He reinvented the character as a legtimate tough guy and he has a presence of actual menace that no previous actor had. That is not to say he is ""best"" or better than others who have played the part, but he has found an original way to play the part true to the character which is unique.

The plot and the villian were well thought out. They used the idea of cyber-terrorism, but didn't overly dwell on it to the exclusion of other things. They used the idea to kick off in a whole other direction. The villian had compelling and understandable motivations. He had a plan that was (mostly) well thought out. The plan *built* progressively to a pay-off that was more than worth it.

The contrasts between hi-tech and low-tech running through the film are part of what makes the cyber-terrorism thing work so well.

The various exotic backdrops were original and interesting. Shanghai in particular. It was contemporary (rather than a standard Bond location) and visually very well done. London was put to good use as well.

Judy Dench did fine work. Her best work in a bond film by far. It was written and acted pitch-perfect. There were so many ways it could have gone wrong. It could have drown in sentementality or been untrue to the characters. But they got everything exactly right. Giving Bond backstory is always incredibly dangerous but they did it the right way. The fault of many films is that backstory becomes a leaping off point into psychological analysis or looking for behavioral causes. They did none of that. They also managed several nostalgia moments that were just long enough to be good.

Ralph Fiennes is introduced as what seems like a useless predictable character familiar from so many films. But he does the near impossible these days in that grows the character into something else through the course of the film and does it with brilliant, short bits of acting. He does very simple things exceptionally well.

Quantum of Solace (the previous film) was an average disappointment as a film. But Skyfall is one of the very best bond films. It was nothing I expected it to be and thats a very good thing.",1352764800,7,2624,4.63010752688172
5036479,4,B006X040NY,"""Skyfall"" isn't a perfect movie, but it is extremely enjoyable on many levels, even for someone who's not a great fan of the James Bond series overall, like me.

Some men who've played Bond relied too heavily on looks and charm, creating a jokily amusing but shallow character. There's nothing shallow about Daniel Craig, a gifted actor whose charm lurks below his rough surface, whose humor is drier than Death Valley in mid-summer, and who gives Bond complexity and substance that's been lacking in the franchise since the Sean Connery days. His affectionate sparring with the equally talented Judi Dench as M, Bond's boss at the British spy agency MI-6, and the decision to reveal something of Bond's early life, provide an emotional center that enables the viewer to feel invested in the characters rather than merely watching them romp through one improbable action set piece after another.

The plot revolves around the theft from MI-6 of a computerized list of the identities of every NATO agent embedded in a terrorist group. M wants Bond to recover the list before the embedded agents' true identities are revealed and they are all killed. The theft of the list becomes publicly known, leading to a painful parliamentary investigation with M in the dock before a grandstanding MP, trying to justify her leadership at MI-6 and the British taxpayers' continued funding of an ""old-fashioned"" intelligence agency like MI-6 in an age of cyber-terrorism.

I enjoyed seeing staged action sequences that did not look computer generated or as though they'd been filmed in front of a green screen. I was pleased to see such an escapist franchise address questions of failure, legacy, aging, abandonment, and our desire that we and the institutions to which we have devoted our lives remain relevant . . . and include an fairly long quote from a Tennyson poem. This Bond has a past, a present and a future.

I don't want to give the impression that the movie is less fun than it is. The action sequences, travelogue photography (Turkey, Shanghai, Macau and Scotland) and  Bond beauties are entirely up to scratch. Javier Bardem is juicily malicious as the villain. Cinematographer Roger Deakins, perhaps best known for his work with Joel and Ethan Coen, captures exquisite images, visual textures and moods as usual--the man is years overdue for an Academy Award. I liked everything about the ending.

There were parts of the movie I thought could have moved a little faster, the genius psychotic cyber-villain seems a bit tired as a plot device, and the shifts from introspection to escapism were sometimes a bit jarring; hence four stars instead of five. But overall a very enjoyable outing. This probably won't be a favorite of people who like their Bond all-escapist, but for people who prefer a bit of thought and emotional engagement mixed in with their spectacle, definitely worth the price of a ticket.",1352678400,6,2908,4.973251028806584
5036480,5,B006X040NY,"This was a movie for adults and a return to the character of James Bond that was missing in that awful sequel to ""Casino Royale"" (""Quantum of Solace""). In ""Skyfall"" James is scarred (physically and emotionally) and more mature, though a bit world weary, but still able to hold his own in a knock-down, drag-out fight and in the boudoir. Unfortunately, for James and us, the ""Bond Girls"" in this movie don't play any major roles and seem, to me, to be on the fringe of things. You don't get to know them as fully as you did the beautiful, intelligent, and sexy Vesper Lynd from ""Casino Royale"", and really don't care much about them. I didn't.

Anyway, Daniel Craig's Bond is older but still has rugged goodlooks, boyish charm, and a muscular physique...unlike the previous prettyboys and fops who played JB after Sean Connery left. He fits the picture one has of Bond, even though Craig isn't the way Ian Fleming described JB in his novels. But, hey, neither did the un-manly Roger Moore and look how many ridiculous Bond movies he starred in.

I will say that the psychopathic bad guy, Raoul Silva, was quite JB's match in this one. He is, perhaps, the most cunning and evil of all the loonies James has ever faced.

There was more humor in this movie than in the others, I think, and those who have seen many of the previous Bond flicks will enjoy the references to little things remembered from the other movies.

I thoroughly enjoyed ""Skyfall"" and give it 4 and 1/2 stars.",1352678400,8,1476,4.558490566037736
5036481,5,B006X040NY,"The year 2012 marks the 50th Anniversary of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-No/dp/B0020PW1V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. No</a>, the movie that kicked off the James Bond film franchise. It was a relatively low-key spy thriller compared to what was to come. Since then, the series has had its ups and downs, but most fans would agree, by the time the 40th Anniversary rolled around with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Another-Day/dp/B0020Q099Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Another Day</a>, the gadgets, stunts, special effects, and even plots had become too over the top for their own good.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B0020M99LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>&nbsp;ditched the clichs and started from scratch, introducing Daniel Craig as a young James Bond just licensed to kill. The movie took a fresh, character-based approach to the series. This approach was continued in the (in my opinion) underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-Of-Solace/dp/B001VIMCW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum Of Solace</a>, which saw Bond developing more class and becoming less emotionally attached to his work. ""Skyfall"" is the best of Daniel Craig's Bond movies so far. Just like Sean Connery and Roger Moore (arguably) hit their strides with their third Bond movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goldfinger/dp/B0020MDEHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goldfinger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spy-Who-Loved-Me/dp/B009G85ALG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spy Who Loved Me</a>, respectively), Daniel Craig has now made it past the two-movie learning curve and really settled into the role.

While six years ago Daniel Craig was playing a young and brash 007, in ""Skyfall"", those around Bond are starting to suggest it may be time to retire. While the mature Bond still has the rough-around-the-edges qualities that distinguish Craig's take on the role, and while he's still able to show angst in the movie's dramatic moments, he also has that wry half-smile while taking out enemies, that satisfied smirk while seducing beautiful women, and he's finally comfortable enough to toss out a few one-liners. Though his delivery is so wonderfully dry that you almost don't realize they're puns.

The movie starts with one of the best opening sequences in decades, an action-packed chase scene involving guns, Range Rovers, motorcycles, and speeding trains through Turkey. This climaxes in Bond's supposed death when his backup sniper accidentally hits him, knocking him off the tracks into the water. After the main titles (one of the most bizarre credit sequences in Bond history, but also, with the help of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skyfall/dp/B009Q6ADG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skyfall</a>, one of the moodiest and most effective) it turns out Bond is taking advantage of being presumed dead to try and get out of the spy game. Until he learns someone is targeting the organization he worked for.

Javier Bardem's villain, a flamboyant bleach blonde, is probably the most memorable since the classic days of Auric Goldfinger and the man with his golden gun. He's introduced with one of the best evil monologues ever, and every scene he's in after that is totally chilling. Berenice Lem Marlohe and Naomie Harris are this movie's Bond girls, and while Marlohe's Severine is one of the most stunning Bond girls in ages and Harris' Eve is one of Bond's savviest sidekicks, their roles are both inconsequential compared to the true female lead. That would be Judi Dench as M. While the relationship between Bond and his superior has been explored more in Daniel Craig's Bond movies than ever before, here it's pushed front and center, forming the movie's emotional core, driving most of the plot, and making M a major player rather than just a character to provide exposition, showcasing Dench's talents as an actress.

Sam Mendes manages to keep a personal, dramatic atmosphere through the entire movie, but still work in jaw-dropping action sequences. Unlike ""Quantum of Solace"", they're thankfully filmed in a steadier, more traditional manner. The movie's also very well paced: this is one of the longest movies in the series, but it feels like one of the shortest. And Mendes and the rest of the ""Skyfall"" crew manage to avoid the clichs while still including Bond's trademarks. There's a new Q, in the form of the young Ben Whishaw. In a fresh new take on the character, when Bond seems disappointed by how practical the gadgets are, the young tech whiz responds, ""Expecting exploding pens? We don't really go in for that sort of thing anymore."" The gadgets bring to mind the earliest Bond movies, where it came as a surprise when Bond was able to use his equipment, unlike later movies, in which the situations that called for the gadgets were so specific you could make a checklist of them in Q's scene and then check them off as Bond used them. There are one or two other familiar characters that pop up as well, in ways that manage to feel both classic and fresh. And Ralph Fiennes brings charisma and gravitas to his role as M's new handler.

This is definitely a Bond movie for modern times.  It's the first time a character (Judi Dench's M) drops the ""F-bomb"" and the first time the bad guy actually makes a pass at 007.

Like the 40th Anniversary, ""Skyfall"" is filled with references to what's come before. Unlike ""Die Another Day"", where the plot line seemed like a flimsy excuse to hang inside jokes on, in ""Skyfall"" the references are much more sly and subtle, and the story's actually sharp enough to support them, so long-time fans can smile while there's still plenty for newcomers to enjoy, even as the throwbacks go over their heads.

There are a few missteps. After all, what Bond movie's been perfect since the Connery days? After some awesome action scenes, the climax seems to be taking a page from a totally different play book, and some of the characters' motivations and actions don't hold up to scrutiny. But overall, the mix of drama, action, and humor make ""Skyfall"" one of the best Bond movies out of the 23. It skillfully ushers in what's sure to be another new beginning for the series, and, back in fine form, I'm excited that ""James Bond will return.""",1352592000,5,6547,5.672448979591837
5036482,3,B006X040NY,"SKYFALL is too many movies to ever succeed in being one great movie - or one very good movie.  The opening chase that never ends is just a tiresome echo of the opening chase in CASINO ROYALE that introduced us to the new Bond.  It worked then, but is ridiculous now.  Bond should burn the tux and jump into a superhero costume with 007 emblazoned across his chest if the films continue to escalate into such absurdly insane realms.  A Road Runner cartoon is more realistic than the first ten or maybe fifteen minutes of this film - and all this before the credits roll on a way too overwhelming title sequence backed by a completely lacklustre title song.

Why do I say the movie is too many movies rolled into one?  Because it definitely feels that way!  Until Javier Bardem makes his grand entrance as a mad mix of the Joker, Hannibal Lecter and Julian Assange, the movie is rather good.  Watching Bond trying to regain the mantle of 007 makes for some rather enthralling viewing. The dissolute Bond playing a danger game with a drink and a scorpion says much without literally saying anything about the need for fulfillment of a danger man's deepest desires even in the face of career degradation.  The photography in these early scenes of Shanghai and Macau by night are breathtaking - as is the photography throughout the entire movie.  However, once the villain comes onto the scene, he marginalizes Bond!  Daniel Craig's Bond seems to shrink in scope and spirit next to Javier Bardem's existential, tortured, scene-stealing bad-ass.  And with this left-hook to the territory come the echoes of too many other films to make SKYFALL make it as one exemplary example in the fifty year Bondian canon.  The last never-ending segments in the Scottish wilderness caused me to have a filmic flashback to STRAW DOGS.  And seeing the great Albert Finney come literally out-of-the-woodwork, I thought I was seeing the ghost of Sebastian Cabot from FAMILY AFFAIR - and deep into the climax of a Bond movie, one shouldn't be thinking of a TV sitcom from ages ago - and yet I was.  I was all over the place because the movie was all over the place.  Some of this ending material even looked like it came out of the Hammer House of Horror.  I half expected Christopher Lee to pop up from the moors and take a bow.

I truly liked Daniel Craig in the first of his Bond films.  The second film was witless - so I was hoping for a strong rebound in SKYFALL.  Apart from the plot, Craig's Bond in this film is completely dour and sour. He never smiles or quips - as did the pitch perfect Sean Connery of the seminal films.  Judi Dench is likewise one-note throughout.  There is much more of interest to be found in Javier Bardem's villain.  Once he appears, the film hardly seemed like a James Bond movie anymore. It seems more like a dozen other films - but not truly like a Bond one.  And the CGI lizards belonged on Skull Island!

Best scene: the silhouetted battle in a skyscraper twixt Bond and an assassin.  Image and music merged perfectly in this too-short sequence. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't quite up to snuff.",1352592000,16,3117,4.551166965888689

This feature has the standard Bond lines, killer title track, sensual scenes, over the top chase action, as well as a return to Bond's roots.

Judi Dench as ""M"" was superb. Adele singing the title track, who else? The Bond series has kept up with the times as expected and leaves sequel possibilities open. Good action flick, although I do not consider this to be the best Bond film ever or even close. It lacked the fun gag names that makes for great spoofs, but did use Silva, the name of our bad guy from the urban dictionary: Silvas are typically the most handsome men one will ever come across in person. A silva is a strong, sexy, and successful individual that doesn't need anyone but himself. Worth a peek on the big screen.

In fact, this may very well be the best James Bond movie to date. In Skyfall we finally get a glimple into 007's background which makes the character even more intriguing. Daniel Craig is awesome as James Bond. He brings a sense of humor to the Bond character that makes this action packed movie very entertaining on all levels. Not to be a spoiler, but there is a part in the movie in which Bond must undergo numerous tests to prove that he is fit for duty. The ""psych evaluation"" scene has got to be one of the funniest that I have seen on film. As always, Judy Dench was great as M and the head of MI6, but Ralph Fiennes (Mallory), Ben Whishaw(Q), and Naomie Harris (Moneypenny) are great additions to the James Bond franchise.

5036485,1,B006X040NY,"Even though never did I warm up to the choice of Daniel Graig as the next Bond (I still think Clive Owen would had been a better fit), I had to admit that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B000FIGHNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>&nbsp;was an excellent Bond film. With all the explosive and seductive sequences and all its gadgets (and product placement) one would expect. It was great, solid entertainment.

Then came&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quantum-of-Solace/dp/B001QE1BDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quantum of Solace</a>&nbsp;and it turned out to be little more than a patchwork of all the leftovers from Casino. As a coda, it had its uses. As a new film, it would not be missed. Little did I know how the future held an even greater disappointment.

I was truly hyped to watch SKYFALL. All the critics praised it and all the buzz was how Mendes managed to revive and, at the same time, humanize Bond. He did not. He did not even try.

The film suffers from a number of shortcomings. The script is weaker than milk and water trying to pass as English tea. Javier does a decent job portraying an albino(?) villain, if not a bit caricaturish. It is the script that make him look incompetent though.
Would you hire a world renown surgeon to clip your nails? How about a champion fisherman to catch fish you already have in a barrel? Well, this supervillain hires a top assassin to snipe at a man who is already surrounded by his men.
If in the post 9/11 world, you somehow managed to get your hands on a military helicopter, would you not remember to equip it with a couple of rockets not to have to rely on its puny machine gun?
And would you endanger your freedom and even your survival in order to kill the person you hate - if you could kill them (and watch them suffer) half a world away by pressing a button? Well, he does exactly that. More than once.

Even then, MI6 is portrayed as even more incompetent. For such a rabid foe was amassing fortune, recruiting henchmen and organizing for years - without MI6 ever wising up to him. And would you ditch your company car because ""they are all bugged"" - only to try to get away undetected with yet another fully equipped ...company car?

Nevertheless, these are not why the latest Bond film fails. Even if realism was the direction recently taken, when was any Bond film able to hold up to such scrutiny? No, the film fails because it is not fun to watch. Most of the action in the film takes place before the opening credits. After that, it is all looks and silences and word association. And, contrary to other Bond films, I could not care less about anything going on on the screen.

This semblance of a story unfolds in a staccato sequence of locations, each resembling an episode shot at a different set. There is neither continuity nor coherence. At the beginning, someone steals an MI6 NOC list in Turkey (I will not even ask what was such a list doing outside the vault and into the field!) and halfway through the movie everyone forgets about it(!) Who cares about all these deep agents, lets save the snotty aristocrat, right? Sadly, if you have seen the trailer, you have seen all there is to see of this film.

I am afraid they destroyed more than the classic DB5 with this one.",1352592000,,3367,4.855400696864112
5036486,5,B006X040NY,"Someone has broken into the most secret files of MI6 and stolen a very important list which, if released, would compromise a great many agents--a list of agents who have infiltrated and are spying on certain terrorist groups around the world. Bond must get that list, or else. But when he finds himself grappling with the thief on top of a train that is about to enter a tunnel, an order from M to a field agent on the ground below sends Bond plummeting to what appears to be certain death in the waters below.

Assuming Bond is dead, M has problems of her own, starting with new boss Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who gives her two months to tie things up and take her well-deserved retirement. Out with the old, in with the new. And the fact that someone has hacked into her private files is most disturbing, someone who keeps asking if she's ready to atone for her sins. Perhaps someone from her past?

Bond returns (of course he's not dead, what kind of Bond film would that be?) after learning of a terrorist assault on MI6. One that was not calculated to kill M, but to be a message to her. Their relationship is rocky--he can't forget the sound of her voice saying, ""Take the shot."" Although he does find it in his heart to forgive the lovely agent who made the shot. James' physical condition is of concern as well, as he learns when he is forced to re-test in order to be let back out into the field, and his shooting skills suck, and his stamina isn't what it used to be.

When M releases Bond for duty, he is sent to Shanghai, after the man who stole the list. His pursuit leads him to a casino in Macau, and a frightened woman who wants the mastermind of the plot to die--if James can survive to do it. They both end up as hostages of Silva (a blond Javier Bardem), a former agent from M's days in Hong Kong.

And then, of course, the plot thickens.

I loved every minute of this film. I didn't even realize it was almost 2  hours long until after I left the theater, riveted on the screen and unmindful of the passage of time. There is no doubt in my mind (if there ever was any, which I don't think there was) that Daniel Craig is the best Bond and this is the best Bond film ever.

One of the things that makes Craig the best is his performance. He makes James real, not just another pretty face (although he is that too). He gives him depth and fleshes him out in a way that no one else ever has (sorry, Sean Connery, you're my second favorite Bond, though).

In Skyfall, we're dealing with issues and themes that are never really touched on in the other films, such as the fact that James is getting older (as is, of course, M). In the other films, it's like they want to pretend that he's ageless, when we know better, so it's refreshing to see it mentioned, and see that James is not invincible--he's just damn good at what he does. The inevitable changing of the guard comes into play too, which is what generally happens when new management comes in, and even M is not immune to being taken out of the picture.

The new Q is young and computer savvy, and he's also afraid of flying, a great foil against the older, more mature Bond, who looks at him at their first meeting like, are you kidding me? I hope to see more of this Q in future, and I suspect we will. It was also great to see Albert Finney, as an old acquaintance of Bond's.

What can I say about Javier Bardem? Most awesome, sexiest villain ever. And for those of you enjoy such things (for example me) there is a scene with the most deliciously homo-erotic content between Silva and Bond. And some of the best lines.

Bond to Silva after an exchange filled with innuendo and double entendres: ""What makes you think it's my first time?""

Priceless, I tell you, priceless!

Plenty of action, hot men, beautiful women, intrigue... you name it, Skyfall's got it. Including a glimpse into Mr. Bond's mysterious past, and questions that are answered. The movie starts with the obligatory chase scene that is a hallmark of the series. Twists and turns you won't see coming, and things I won't give away.

I loved every minute of this film, and can't wait to see it again! Daniel Craig is James Bond. I can't wait for the next installment, and it can't come too soon for me!",1352592000,5,4252,4.332075471698113

Craig has the rough and tough body needed for Bond, a sense of decency about him, and he cleans up nice.  Judy Dench is spectacular and plays a major role this time.  Javier Bardem creates a totally different villain that is a perfect foil for Bond.  Albert Finney is his usual great in a small but significant role.  Kudos for the script and directing.

5036488,4,B006X040NY,"What ""SkyFall"" offers to its audience is Bond, James Bond, as an espionage agent...not as a cardboard character or a flawlessly dressed superhero. Back in the 1950's and 1960's, that's how Bond was imagined by his creator.  Go back to the books - start with Casino Royale or From Russia with Love - and you will see that Bond is a tough, loyal, hard-edged spy.  Daniel Craig brings this kind of Bond back.  Sean Connery was glamorous, Roger Moore was silly, but Daniel Craig acts, moves, and thinks like a spy.

And the villain in ""SkyFall"" was once an important asset of MI6...perhaps a friend of Bond once.  He is the enemy today because he wants revenge. Why? He was cruelly betrayed by Britain and M when it was expedient for him to get captured and tortured.  He was traded for 6 other British agents. See the film ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" to get an idea how governments will and do make these choices at the personal sacrifice of their agents.  When my father was a spy against the Nazis for the French this was a real fear when he operated in enemy territory. Can you really trust your own side, when you live in the shadows?  And so Raoul Silva (Javier Barden) - the new enemy of MI6 - was born by surviving his betrayal. Governments do create their own Frankensteins.

Both the flawed psychological, hurt natures of Bond and Silva are explored in this brilliant thriller. As Judi Dench (as M) puts it, orphans make the best spies.

Although there are some extraordinary stunts in the film, gone are most of the spy gadgets that helped Bond get out of trouble.  He has to use his brains, not only his courage, to win this showdown.  I love the part when he goes back into time, and drives his ""Goldfinger"" vehicle again.  The gadget that villian Raoul Silva uses, is one we live with everyday - the computer.  For he is an expert in cybercrime.

Now we have reached Bond at 50 - Daniel Craig nails it. Although I must confess that this Bond is someone who doesn't smile or enjoy luxury wines - something I miss from the Sean Connery days.",1352592000,4,2057,4.4190981432360745
5036489,5,B006X040NY,"One of the great signature stamps of movies over the last 50 years has been the opening sequences of the James Bond films.  This newest version is no exception and certainly must rank as one of the best.

Bond (Daniel Craig) is on the trail of a mysterious evil-doer who has managed to obtain a computer drive that contains the names of deep cover agents who have infiltrated various terrorist organizations.  Bond is shot by mistake by Eve (Naomie Harris), an agent working with him and is believed to have been killed falling into a fast moving river.

Now certainly at the 20 minute mark we know Bond isn't actually dead.  After a few months of pounding down booze on some unknown island he learns that his boss ""M"" (Judi Dench) is under scrutiny for losing the agent names.  Bond resurfaces and manages to track down the culprit in southern China.

Bond films have another common component throughout the years.  The villain.  They are always rich.  They are always powerful.  And they always want more.  As one of the best bad guys in memory, Oscar winner Javier Bardem plays Silva, a one-time MI6 agent and computer genius.  He doesn't necessarily want more money and power, he wants revenge.  He's after ""M"" who he feels betrayed him years earlier.

Directed by another Oscar winner, Sam Mendes, ""Skyfall"" focuses on the actors.  Terrific performances are coaxed out of Craig, Bardem and especially Dench, another Oscar winner.  Mendes also manages to blend in many older Bond staples, not the least of which is 007's pristine Aston Martin DB:5, with some new; including updated versions of old characters (Q and Ms. Moneypenny) along with another surprise.

While the heart of this film is in the story and the emotion rarely seen in the franchise, ""Skyfall"" is not short on what makes it Bond.  There are glorious visuals, especially in Shanghai, a cool gadget or two (but no exploding pen), hot girls and a memorable final act.  While I have a fondness for all the Bond films and all the actors who played 007, this one may be at the top of the heap.

BLU RAY UPDATE (3-17-13):  This was my favorite movie of 2012, so watching it again on Blu ray was high on my list of things to do.  If anything, I'm more impressed.  Not having to worry about plot details, I was able to focus on the production values, soundtrack, editing and yes the quality of the transfer.  All of which equal my appreciation for the film.

Here, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed to have been killed, but resurfaces when he sees his boss ""M"" (Judi Dench) under political pressure for allowing a list of embedded NATO agents to be acquired by the bad guys.  Both Bond and ""M"" are tired and seem unlikely to continue.  But they do.  Director Sam Mendes (who also contributes one of the 2 commentary tracks) masterfully integrates a change for future Bond films including new characters who blend in nicely with the past.

One of the things I noticed is the great photography in this film which sparkles in this 1080p transfer.  The colors are off the chart.  The blacks are black.  Check out the gorgeous shot of Shanghai at night, dense with colorful lighting against the black sky.  When the story moves to Scotland, the palette changes to greens, blues and browns as the topography changes.  From what I can tell, this transfer does not include any IMAX images shown in some theaters.

Like the video, the audio track is exemplary.  Using the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, a properly set up room bristles with activity including a marvelous opening sequence.  As opposed to every other Bond film, the conclusion of the scene results in Bond and MI6's failure to get the bad guy(s).  As the Oscar winning song by Adele plays over the credits, we yearn for the next event.  The surrounds are active with waterfalls, crashing glass, helicopters, gunfire and explosions throughout the film.  The dialog is always crystal clear throughout.

Extras include a second commentary track by the current generation of Broccoli producers and production designer Dennis Gassner, a 59 minute ""Shooting Bond"" documentary, a short set of ""Skyfall"" premier interviews, a trailer, a soundtrack promo and a slew of other film trailers.",1352592000,4,4204,4.765927977839335
5036490,1,B006X040NY,"I love Daniel Craig and James Bond. My favorite James Bond movie is Tomorrow Never Dies. But I hate movies like Skyfall where the villain is just out to get the good guys for a past grievance. It is just like all those Batman, Spiderman, and Superman movies where the bad guy is just out to get the superhero. So in a way the superhero is the one who brings the trouble.",1352505600,18,370,4.152777777777778
5036491,5,B006X040NY,"Being the year of the 50th anniversary of the beloved super spy, the 23rd Bond installment had a lot to live up to. While Casino Royale was a worthy and thrilling reboot to the franchise, Quantum of Solace fell flat with critics and fans. To make matters more interesting, MGM has had financial woes over the last number of years and needed a hit to reinvigorate the studio. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Skyfall.

Not only does the movie qualify as one of the most action-packed and entertaining movies of the year, it ranks on my list as one of the best Bond flicks to date. As has come to be expected, Craig is terrific as the British spy, portraying the character with charm and intensity. The action is top notch and the story is superbly written. Among my favorite moments were the blistering opening sequences, the introduction of the film's villain, and the intense final act, which finds Bond cornered yet unafraid. The real treat, however, is Bardem's role as the sinister Silva. Rivaling any villain in recent memory, save Heath Ledger's Joker, Bardem is intimidating, powerful, and irresistible to watch. You'll find yourself glued to the screen whenever he appears, and hoping he'll show up again soon when he's gone.

Another huge nod has to go to Mendes, whose vision of Bond is spectacular. The movie is tightly scripted and the director does a very fine job of bringing out great performances from his cast. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a film for a long time; the production crew did a remarkable job utilizing light, colors, and atmosphere to really draw the audience in. Another treat is the glimpse the audiences gets into Bond's past, which plays a crucial role in the film.

The transfer to Blu-ray is beautiful; the colors are pin-sharp and the picture is clear, crisp, and detailed. In a film that contains such vibrant colors and contrasts, this was immensely important for home release. All of the great cinematographic moments you saw in the theater look just as great here. The audio is equally perfect. The disc's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track contain all the intensity and clarity contained in the theatrical release so you can enjoy the crashes, explosions, gun shots, and dialogue in high definition.

By way of special features, there's just under an hour of behind-the-scenes featurettes that are an interesting watch, as well as the original action-heavy trailer for the movie, ""Skyfall Premiere"" feature, and two different audio commentaries; a detailed and information-rich feature from Mendes and a not-so-interesting one from producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and production designer Dennis Gassner. The insight from Mendes is fascinating and any fan of the film will be sure to enjoy it. The commentary from the producers felt more like a promotion of the film and could have been left off the disc in my opinion.

Whether your a die-hard Bond fan or a casual observer, Skyfall has something for everyone. There are multiple references to past Bond adventures, yet enough new and innovative ideas to please newcomers to the franchise. I highly recommend this film. This BD set doesn't boast hours and hours of extra footage but it has enough to please fans that are curious about the making of the film. Overall a terrific movie, beautiful disc transfer, and engaging Blu-ray set.",1352505600,650,3352,4.894366197183099
5036492,5,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig knocked this out of the park. Unbelievable. This is definitely a must-see film.

5036493,5,B006X040NY,"Is Skyfall better than Casino Royale? Too close to call, but after the below average Quantum of Solace, I can say that Bond is back in top form. Great action (best opening sequence ever...you know the one involving the train bit shown in all the trailers), story and acting. Daniel Craig turns in his best performance yet and truly has become a first rate James Bond. Javier Bardem plays a very weird and creepy villain here. Almost polar opposite in style (other than the bad hair) of his turn in No Country for Old Men. Judi Dench plays M brilliantly for the seventh time and gets more screen time in Skyfall than all the others combined. The two Bond girls are good. One plays a major role as Bond's ""partner"" and has a famous last name revealed at the end. The other is pure eye candy. 007 fans are sure to appreciate all the little gags from previous films in the series. We even get a young Q.

So any flaws? It's maybe a little too long with some slow moving segments, but overall I loved almost every second.

5036494,5,B006X040NY,"Javier Bardin's villain is the most memorable villain to hit a Bond film since Ernst Stavro Blofield was last seen in ""Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and I don't count Jaws as a villain (cartoon characters really aren't scary).  This Bond film has an edge, and real violence and nastiness that other Bond films sometimes lack.  The personal beef the villain has with our main characters is the driving force of this movie, and Bardin brings a performance home that if it weren't in a Bond film could be Oscar-worthy.

Craig is excellent, and the supporting cast is boosted by Ralph Fienes, and other newcomers who will populate future Bond films.  Read summaries in other reviews if you must, but from the retro-theme song by Adele down to the ending with Miss Moneypenny, this film has got the good stuff.",1352505600,4,806,4.776978417266187
5036495,5,B006X040NY,"Rating:
After I was put to sleep by the last Bond film, I was not up for another. But with all the big critical reviews, I thought i would give this one a shot. I am glad I did. This one grabbed me from the opening sequence with Bond on a high speed chase on motorcyles, that included going across the roofs of buildings and culminating in his apparent death.

As the film progresses, someone has cracked Interpol's computers and gotten a list of every agent working undercover throughout the world. The perpetrator starts posting the list on the Internet putting the agents at risk. He also seems to have it in for M. Meanwhile, M is told to take an involuntary retirement for the mess that has been created.

Bond is then resurrected (never explained exactly how) and it is up to him to help M find who has done the evil deeds. The evildoer this time is played by Javier Bardeem who is one of the most psycho villiains to be seen in a Bond flick. Bardeem is a former agent who was once sold out by M (note: at the beginning of the film Bond is also sold out by her but he holds no grudge). He will always be one step ahead of the good guys. Bond is going through a crisis himself as he is no longer a youngster and many of his skills are not as sharp as they once were.

In this film we will learn a little about Bond's childhood and what had made him such a good agent. This movie is a standalone good film that anyone can enjoy without having seen the two prior Craig installments.",1352505600,7,1485,4.185314685314685
5036496,5,B006X040NY,"""Skyfall"" is a great action film that has the James Bond character coming back to help save Great Britain's M16 agency.  Other key players play a strong role in the outcome of Bond's mission with performances by Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Judi Dench, Ben Wishaw, and Rory Kinnear.  Javier Bardem plays a key part in shaping Bond's character growth.  Then you have the Bond character skillfully expressing the romantic charmer archetype with Eve Moneypenny (played by Naomie Harris) and Severine (played by Berenice Marlohe).  There were other actors  (too numerous to mention) that also played an important part in the professional objectives to Bond's character.  ""Skyfall"" is great if you like any of the James Bond films or any other action films.",1352505600,7,753,5.131147540983607
5036497,5,B006X040NY,"The first thing I noticed about Skyfall was the vast amount of talent involved. With apologies to Sean Connery, Daniel Craig gives the best acting performances of any Bond. It's not that he's a better actor than Connery, but he's asked to play the role with a lot more realism, and that works well for me.

Other actors of note are even better than Craig: Judi Dench is wonderful as M, Javier Bardem is over the top and hilarious as Silva, and Ralph Fiennes appears as Gareth Mallory. It's rare that Oscar winners and nominees have so many key roles in an action movie.

In addition to the acting talent, Sam Mendes (American Beauty) directs, Thomas Newman (10 Oscar nominations) is responsible for the score, and Roger Deakins (9 Oscar nominations) does his usual excellent job with the cinematography.

While I enjoyed Quantum of Solace, it was definitely flawed. It was too short, so everything felt rushed. It was also rather unbalanced, with five major chase scenes in the first 30 minutes, and an abundance of quick cuts and shaky-cam. Skyfall has a couple of major chase scenes, but the action never eclipses the overall story.

The plot is pretty simple. A computer hard drive has been stolen, and it contains the identities and missions of MI6 agents. M's computer is hacked and she is informed that the identities of five agents will be released each week. It becomes clear that the knowledge originated from MI6, or from someone with intimate knowledge of the organization.

Bond is injured and believed to be dead after an accident early in the movie, but he turns up alive when he feels that his services are needed. However, he's clearly not completely healthy. Is he fit for duty? Is age catching up with him? Would it be dangerous to allow him to resume duty while he is recovering? I like that Bond is portrayed as vulnerable. He can be hurt, and he can make mistakes.

Craig's Bond is a different beast from any that have come before. He's colder and tougher, and the campy humor is gone. That's not to say that the humor is completely absent, it's just smarter and funnier. Many of the best lines are possible because of the relationship between Bond and M. Check out the word association scene for an example.

Most of the expected elements are present. The movie visits China, Turkey, England and Scotland. There's obviously a new Bond girl, but she's in fewer scenes than you might expect. The music, action sequences and humor all add to the familiar feel. There's even a few references to previous Bond movies, and fans will love the inspired inclusion of an old piece of machinery.

The movie also continues to establish characters that we have come to know and love from previous entries in the franchise, but I'll let you make those discoveries for yourself.

After 23 movies and 50 years, the Bond franchise is alive and well. Many critics are suggesting that Skyfall is the best Bond movie to date. They may be right, but I can't decide between Skyfall and Casino Royale. Skyfall wouldn't work as well without the relationships and story arc established in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The three Craig movies don't quite have the depth of the Bourne movies, but the gap is miniscule.

Skyfall will appeal to fans of Bond, spy movies, and action movies. I only hope that Craig's next two appearances as Bond are up to this standard.

Overall score 4.5/5",1352505600,8,3389,4.70777027027027
5036498,5,B006X040NY,"M made a decision in the past that hurt someone? Yes, and that tough call complicates matters for MI6; even James Bond's loyalty is put to the test. However, with world class villains (and his own death) to contend with, there isn't a moment to reflect on her misdeeds.

Director Sam Mendes (""Revolutionary Road"") is working for the first time with the Broccoli family, who has owned this Bond franchise for 50 years. There is no doubt Mendes knows exactly what the fans expect, he delivers non-stop action, wonderful reminders of past Bond films, lots of gunfire and fisticuffs, plus oodles of blowie uppie stuff!

We recognize the regulars, but watch for some new ones, too:
  * Daniel Craig (""Defiance"") is back as Bond, resurrected from the dead and furious that M gave the order to shoot him (he was wearing an ear bud). Now he must cope with a damaged body that doesn't do quite what he wants.
  * Judi Dench (""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") is still M, beleaguered, bedeviled and besieged. Of course, her quips are almost as funny as Bond's.
  * Ben Whishaw (""Cloud Atlas"") is the callow youth who personifies this generation of technophiles. Yup, to Bond's dismay, this mop-headed geek is our new Q and we love him from the get-go!
  * Naomie Harris (""Mandala, Long Walk to Freedom"") is Bond's sidekick in the opening scenes in Istanbul. Wait until you hear her last name!
  * Javier Barden (""Biutiful"") seems to have SUCH fun playing villains; this flaxen-haired bad guy is almost as persistent as our hero; he just doesn't know when to quit! Revenge is a powerful motivator.

This popular franchise illustrates what we mean when we say ""sensory overload."" It isn't necessary to suspend disbelief in these things because we know as we walk in the door that we will be bombarded with PG-13 cartoony violence, hair's-breath escapes and quippy dialogue. It's what we want, it's what we pay for and it's what we get!

With this one, even though it satisfies the target audience, I must admit that I was shaken, not stirred.

When I get the DVD from Amazon, the closed captions will make up for the missing dialog, then I can love it like the rest of the audience!",1352505600,7,2170,4.673684210526316
5036499,5,B006X040NY,"I've read more than few reviews declaring Skyfall the best Bond film of all time. So is it? It's probably the most well crafted Bond film just slightly ahead of Casino Royale. The film is much better than Quantum of Solace but is it better than a film like Goldfinger? Skyfall and Goldfinger are so dramatically different that it's like asking if Saving Private Ryan is better than Tropic Thunder. Skyfall has a very methodical pacing clocking it at 143 minutes (actually a minute shorter than Casino Royale) and the film might have benefited from a touch of pruning. Personally I preferred Casino Royale but Skyfall is an amazing film with perhaps the best casting of any in the series. This is the most serious Bond film among the 23 and Javier Bardem will undoubtedly go down as one of if not the best Bond villain ever. Every scene with Bardem is magic but you have to be patient because Bardem doesn't make an appearance until well into the film.

As strange is it may sound Skyfall is more of a continuation of the Pierce Brosnan films than the two Daniel Craig movies. The World is Not Enough explored the idea of M putting the mission objective ahead of people and reaping the results. In Die Another Day after being released from 14 months of torture in North Korea Bond is treated in an absurdly callous manner by M. Given the fact that he had previously saved London from a disastrous EMP burst, prevented a nuclear explosion and stopped World War III she might want to cut him some slack. Skyfall's main plot is pretty much the same as the subplot of The World is Not Enough in that M's disregard of another's life comes back to haunt her. In some ways Bardem's Silva is almost a surrogate for Brosnan's Bond seeking revenge for the torture. The difference between Skyfall and the aforementioned films is that Skyfall is done a thousand times better.

To my great delight Skyfall stops the horrible rapid cut action scenes of Quantum of Solace that hurt the film so badly. The action here is light years better. The plot on the other hand is best enjoyed if you don't consider it too deeply. I refer to the film plot but it could also apply to the villains plot. Bardem's goal of revenge is rather modest. In fact it's probably something achievable by just about anyone with a small amount of motivation. The only way it could be made into a film is because Bardem tries to achieve his goal in the most audaciously complicated way possible. It would be like trying to cross the road by spending years investing millions in research on a jet pack rather than just crossing when the light changes. Still, if you just accept things for what they are it's a heckuva thrill ride.

I was so happy when Casino Royale came out proving that the Bond producers still had what it takes to stay relevant and produce a slam dunk but after Quantum of Solace I was concerned that Casino Royale might be to Daniel Craig what Goldeneye was to Pierce Brosnan, the only really good film of his tenure. Skyfall has shown that Casino Royale was no fluke. For the first time in 50 years Bond has gone beyond popcorn entertainment and entered the realm of great films and given the fact that the producers have plans to come out with a new movie every two years Bond fans may be in store for some tremendous excitement.",1352505600,6,3308,4.519198664440735
5036500,4,B006X040NY,"Skyfall is the 23rd film in the series which also marks the 50th anniversary of the longest running franchise in cinematic history.  Starring Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Albert Finney, this one brings us full circle on the spy we know so much yet so little about.

On the trail of a stolen hard drive containing the rosters of every known undercover and covert NATO operative embedded around the world, Bond and a new agent- Eve- pursue the thief.  In the process Bond is wounded and presumed dead.  Taking advantage of the opportunity, Bond quietly disappears (and they never explain how he survived, btw), only to return when learning of a terrorist attack on MI6 headquarters.  Like any good spy, M is haunted by her past; someone who both knows her secrets and how MI6 operates is determined to make her pay for her sins.  But after so much wear and tear- physically and emotionally- is our man still up to the job?

The backdrop to all this poses questions about the viability and consequences of lone agents operating in the field in today's political climate- the very environment which gives rise to both the villain's and Bond's own story arcs.  These two share a bond only someone in their position can ever understand.  It's good to see the angst from the books making its way into the movies.

Many previously unexplored elements of the Bond universe are touched upon here; best of all is a revealing glimpse into his past- which is where the film gets its name from.  The word association scene from the teaser is a good piece of storytelling via foreshadowing, its meaning becoming clear in the movie's final act.

At over two hours long it definitely could've used some trimming, but hey- it's Bond.  Skyfall's script is clever, its dialogue witty, its scenery elegant, its action brutal and its angst relevant to the characters and these modern times.  And there are several nods to the past that'll definitely make you smile: can you say Ejector Seat?  I knew that you could.

Without giving it all away, this is the film that officially and completely reboots the franchise.  If you're one of those who thought certain elements were missing from the first two Daniel Craig films, your faith will be restored with this one.  Even the opening sequence is a gorgeous return to form, definitely invoking the classic styles of the late Maurice Binder.

As a lifelong James Bond fan, Skyfall makes a welcome addition to the franchise.  Old friends, new faces, different challenges, same old James.  Who can ask for more?",1352505600,12,2578,4.787330316742081
5036501,5,B006X040NY,"Although ""Casino Royale"" was a very good Bond movie, this one is better. The first 2 Daniel Craig Bond films placed him in unfamiliar settings with unfamiliar characters updating him to the 21st century and a lot of high tech heroics. On many levels, Bond goes back in time here.
There are several spoilers and I won't reveal any of them here as they should be enjoyed as they happen. The movie starts out as a successor to the first 2 Daniel Craig Bonds but as the plot progresses, the series reaches back and finds it origins.
Veteran fans of the series will love it as will those familiar with the Sean Connery Bond films. This is the 50th anniversary Bond movie and they succeed in establsihing that this is now the charcter played by Sean Connery working for the same organization. Very well done.",1352505600,5,802,4.537931034482758
5036502,3,B006X040NY,"I suppose this is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? That remains to be seen. With time, I see that this really is not a good Bond film. Time has a way of putting  things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. In retrospect, I didn't. Reflect on it I suppose.

On another note, I saw this film in both the standard theatrical release and the IMAX version as well. The aspect ratios are definitely different. The IMAX aspect ration was closer to a standard 4 x 3 instead of the usual widescreen. I found the IMAX version somewhat enjoyable and contemplative for some reason. And, and I cannot believe I am saying this, put the gun barrel back at the beginning of the film. It really would have made a difference on this film.",1352505600,6,1574,4.332203389830508
5036503,4,B006X040NY,"As someone who grew up with the James Bond movies, from Sean Connery up, I love them all.  This one is no exception, but I can also tell you it did not have the same OOMPH as the prior Bond flicks.  It was not Daniel Craig.  I love him as Bond.  It was the actual story line--great but not excellent. The stunts seemed noticeably less than normal, as well as the romance.  Judy Dent returns as ""M"".  Her wonderful dry British humor seems to enhance her personality for playing the dry, tough, unemotional head of Intelligence.  (We know the emotions are all there, but well-masked.)

The flick begins with an opening chase on motorcycles, across rooftops in Istanbul.  From rooftops, we jump to a racing train.  From a distance another agent watches, as ""M"" in London directs her to ""Take the Shot"".  The bad guy is carrying a data pack with all the agents' names and pictures, so the steaks are pretty darned high.  As things begin to escalate, there appears to be an attack on the British Secret Service.  We travel to Macau, and later to Scotland in our movie seats.

Great film, great actors, including Ralph Fiennes at MI6 Intelligence and veteran great Albert Finney (who does not seem to be mentioned anywhere in the writeups) as the tough old caretaker of Bond's Skyfall estate in Scotland.",1352505600,3,1298,4.611353711790393
5036504,2,B006X040NY,"Daniel Craig is a marvelous actor. He just shouldn't be playing Bond, who was dark, sophisticated, and all that sort. Craig looks like an East End working class drunkard, no matter how much one might cover him in Tom Ford. In Skyfall, the new ""tradition"" of completely impossible to survive cartoon violence continues, which should delight that part of the audience still in need of acne treatments. The villain is more interesting than Bond, but is a little too cutesy for the appropriate level of menace. Hopkins pulled it off as Lecter, our man Javier, who himself mastered the art of menace in No Country for Old Men, comes up rather short here. Spoiler here: The one bright spot of the film is when M is finally knocked off. Dame Dench was more appropriate as M's mother, than M. Hopefully they won't bring her back to life. The original flavor of Bond is dead with the Craig franchise.  The original flavor of the Fleming Novels doesn't even get a chance to breathe. Also, two hours and twenty three minutes of chase, bang, chase, morose reflection, mate, chase, bang, etc.? Oh for the days of Peter Hunt on the cutting room floor. There are some great individual scenes in this movie. All it needs is a more sophisticated plot, more interesting women (as were found in Casino Royale), and some realistic violence. However see it, because we are told in the credits James Bond Will Return anyway, and this fifty year old franchise deserves some respect, even if it is turning into a Tom and Jerry cartoon with chicks and three dimensional pyrotechnics.",1352505600,13,1558,4.727941176470588
5036505,4,B006X040NY,"The creators of the latest or modern Bond movies want to explore or expose a different side to James Bond's personality. That is what Skyfall is in part about.

But I have a challenge for them: create a Bond girl and put her into the movie from the very first minute and keep her character alive to the very last minute. In my view, the Bond girls enter the movies too quickly or die too quickly and Bond has it easy. I would love to see Bond struggle to keep a Bond girl alive or to save or to interact with one for the duration of an entire full movie.",1352505600,4,554,4.036363636363636
5036506,4,B006X040NY,"First, this will not contain spoilers.

I decided to go into Skyfall with very little information about the film.  I read very little and stayed away from any sneak peeks unlike the last two films in which I had advanced knowledge of the plot and certain elements.  This way I was able to get a feel of the film on it's own merits as I experienced it vs reconciling it against any preconceived notions.

For those who want a short review I found Skyfall to be a good film.  It blends traditional elements with a non-traditional flow.  It's really unlike the majority of the formulaic Bonds and will stand out in the franchise.  The film it shares the most similarities, in my opinion, is Dr. No.  A fitting resemblance considering the 50th Anniversary of that very film.

The overall feel of Skyfall is far more modern but matches the pacing and formula of Dr. No.  No always stands out against the franchise as one of the more different films obviously because it was the first and the producers had not found their stride.  Skyfall fits into that mold, bucking the previous trends in the series.  Yes it has it's traditional moments, and I suspect that many fans will be happy that their demands for certain elements previously omitted from Casino and Quantum have been reinserted to the reboot.  These elements will help fans re-introduce themselves to the Bond of old but the very non-traditional pacing of the film will most likely generate a divided response from fans.  I fully expect this film to be received well critically but many traditional fans will dislike it perhaps even more than Quantum of Solace.  I won't hail Skyfall as the best Bond film but it certainly will fit well in the collection and I will be glad to snap up the DVD when it releases later next year.

Skyfall is yet another addition to the reboot of Bond and many will find it breaks with some convention.  Unlike Quantum it does not really continue any specific storyline.  Instead it harkens back to the older Bonds where the new villains were stand alone characters but you could certain infer that they were a member of SPECTER or in this case Quantum.  Like Mr. White and Mr. Green in the previous two films, Skyfall features yet another color, Mr. Silver.  Quantum is never named in Skyfall but it is very easy to infer that it's there.  Javier Bardem is perhaps the jewel of this film.  His performance is amazing and his scenes are easily the best in the movie.  His appearance is clearly drawn from Christopher Walken's Max Zorin with the mental derangement really ramped up.  I thoroughly enjoyed Bardem and think he is one of the better villians created in Bond Universe and it's a crime that he ended up with so little screen time.  Much like Dr. No, Silver is largely an offscreen character.  Regardless the film still rewards you as it carries on.

The action scenes were well shot and there is some very impressive stunt work at play here.  I was pleased for the most part with the physical stunt work.  There was still elements of CGI but not as heavy as some of the earlier films.  The pacing was a bit different than previous Bonds and it worked for me.  I liked the change ups Mendes threw this time.  The climactic 30 minutes is really unlike any Bond movie ever made before and ironically has more in common with an episode of the A-Team or a certain McCauley Culkin series but in the end it's entertaining.

My biggest gripes really fall to the story and plot.  There are really two stories going on in the film.  The primary plot line is a confusing affair.  For much of the film you, as is Bond, are pretty much in the dark about what is going on and then abruptly the plot motivation is crammed down your throat with virtually no follow up.  A lot of viewers in the theater around me were very confused about what was really going on and it was clear Mendes was really leaving a lot up to the audience to piece together or just flat out infer/make up in their own minds.  The second storyline is a substory revolving around Bond/M and his past yet again.  Much like the previous Craig Bond's a lot of little hints are made and it's clear something was going on but they never actually come out with any explanations.  The final act of the film is likewise very ambiguous in this area for reasons I won't get into.  Basically the substory really never gets resolved in any satisfying way and it feels as though Mendes wanted to tease you but leave it up to you to fill the story out yourself.  Not sure how I truly feel about that approach.  The main storyline ends up being a little thin and as such it's clear that the films merits lay in the journey here and not the actual substance.  Again this reminds me of Dr. No in that the journey was more rewarding than the actual story.

In the end Skyfall is a successful modern action film on it's own and a worthy addition to the Bond franchise.  It caps off the ambitious Bond reboot trilogy and it closes out an era well.  It will be long debated where Skyfall falls into the series relevance and I am sure it will not be fancied by many but if you are a Bond fan it will entertain you and it will most likely end up in your film collection.",1352419200,8,5198,4.446088794926005
5036507,4,B006X040NY,"Some beautiful photography, good performances, and real stunts help to make this newest Bond film worth watching.  But it's not quite up to the top Bond entries because of stale and overused plot contrivances in which the otherwise interesting villian uses computers and hacking as his weapons of choice.  The best Bonds set standards rather than follows them and frankly computer hacking is lazy scriptwriting.  Still, kudos must be given to the sheer flair in which many of the sequences are delivered, particularly the scenes in Shanghai and Scotland.  There are also a number of homages to other Bond films that are fun to spot.

5036509,4,B006X040NY,"Skyfall is a very interesting and entertaining entry in this 50 year old series in that it gives us all the classic elements that we've come to expect from a Bond film and yet, takes it into new and unexpected territory. Not everyone is going to like where it goes but, I certainly did. The story is actually quite simple. After a mission goes awry, 007 (Daniel Craig) is thought dead but, is actually living in secret, drowning the negative effects of his job with sex and booze. But, when a mysterious and sinister individual targets MI6 and M (Dame Judi Dench) in particular, Bond returns to action despite doubts from some of his superiors that he still can handle the job. Writers Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and John Logan craft a story that is part spy thriller and part Silence Of The Lambs as Bond faces not a villainous organization or government but, one very dangerous and psychotic ex-MI6 agent known as Silva (Javier Bardem) who is bent on avenging what he feels is a betrayal by his former boss, M. It's a daring direction to give this Bond film a more personal focus despite it's scope and having Bond defending, not Queen and Country but, the one person he can even remotely consider family, M, from a man whose motives for revenge are equally personal. And director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road To Perdition) is more then up to the task. Mendes gives the film the epic scope we've come to expect from these moves as the film travels from Turkey to Shanghai and from Macau to London and Scotland but, never looses focus on the characters or story. He directs the action in a refreshingly old fashion manner, no more evident then in the thrilling train set pre-credit sequence. No quick cuts or shaky-cam, just good intense action. The action is what's exciting, not the  camera or editing tricks used to make it exciting. He gets great performances out of his cast. Craig is sensational as a Bond who is a bit burnt-out and bitter yet, is driven by duty and loyalty to return to a life he has a chance to escape... a life that maybe is right for him after all. Bardem is simply brilliant as the demented and dangerous yet, disturbingly flamboyant, Silva. A man who is Bond's equal in many way's but, is demented by his inner pain and thirst for revenge. Dame Judi Dench is great in an expanded role for M. She and Craig are magic together and it's great to see them share so many scenes after Quantum Of Solace kept them apart for almost that entire film. The supporting cast including Naomie Harris (Eve). Ralph Fiennes (Mallory) and Ben Whishaw (a young, computer geek-ish Q) are all excellent and provide great support for the principles. Mendes makes this flick look great with some stunning camera work such as the Blade Runner-esque Shanghai and the moody moors of Scotland. The film is deliberately paced but, it is more thriller then action flick although, there is plenty of the latter. Round that out with a very Bond score by Thomas Newman, a classic Bond theme by Adele and one of the best opening credits sequences in some time and you have a solid James Bond flick that is both charmingly familiar and yet boldly treads new ground.

5036510,1,B006X040NY,"Never been much of a Bond fan, but Daniel Craig has completely ruined the franchise. He's a terrible actor, and making the series into a bourne rip-off has made me completely hate the franchise. Skyfall is not worth watching. Trust me when I tell you this!",1352419200,16,256,4.586956521739131
5036511,4,B006X040NY,"Note: I will not say much about the plot here. If you really want to know, it's easy to find out. But I believe you will enjoy the movie more without knowing what will happen, especially what happens leading up to the showdown at Skyfall - you do NOT even want to know in advance WHO IS THERE at Skyfall, trust me, or you will miss some of the emotional punch. So here goes ...

My first impression, right after the movie: not enough spectacle.

The opening chase was pretty good, but otherwise there's not much in the way of thrills in the middle apart from a couple of brief scuffles (and a poorly-chosen mode of vertical travel). The action is not that interesting, but thankfully it is not shot in the idiotically shaky ""Bourne-camera"" mode. And there is a ridiculous thing involving a, uh, diverted train, which doesn't really add much. The finale is a mixed bag - more complexity would have been nice, but it's interesting because Bond is preposterously outgunned.

But a little later it sinks in: this is not the heart of the movie. Yes, surprisingly, it's about heart.

This movie is about depth, in more ways than one. It is about creating and experiencing a deeper, emotional connection with the characters, especially Bond. And in this it truly succeeds. You feel for the poor guy, from his opening plunge, through his feelings of betrayal and duty, and to the deep, terrible loss that is embodied in one of the movie's most important characters, Skyfall Lodge - Bond's childhood home. It is a genuinely moving, touching, darker and deeper Bond. When I watch it again, it will be for those moments.

Everyone is top-notch - Bond, M, the new Q, and of course Silva, played by Javier Bardem as a strangely sympathetic monster you can't stop watching. His meetings with Bond seem anticlimactic, and their final face-off not too satisfying, but his connection to M is well-played, disturbing and affecting.

M has a greater role here, explored in more depth - the hard calls she has to make, her connection (such as it is) with her agents, and her dedication. Her hard-nosedness and her professional and physical vulnerability are nicely juxtaposed. One of the most moving moments is her quoting Tennyson -

Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

- while we see Bond, a broken and betrayed Bond, a seemingly outdated relic, rushing to save her. It is quite a powerful moment, one that you will want to see again.

At the end, the movie takes an unexpected turn which ties it into the whole Bond mythology. Although tinged with sadness, fans will rejoice.

The title song, which seemed weak and forgettable on first listen (before seeing the movie), turns out to suit the movie quite well along with the brooding visuals of the opening credits. Both take on more meaning and emotional wallop after having viewed the movie, and I find I could watch them again and again:

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

That last line really hits home, in the context of the finale.

So - I wish there were more spectacular action. The middle drags a bit. But it is compelling and engaging on an emotional level, giving us a Bond we can feel for and even cheer on.",1352419200,11,3431,4.568403908794788
5036512,4,B006X040NY,"It may be hard to believe, but James Bond was a complete stranger to this household until the week ""Skyfall"" was released. Squeezing viewings of ""Casino Royale,"" ""Quantum of Solace,"" and ""Skyfall"" into one day probably isn't such a bad idea, but it was a pretty interesting experience for someone who was unfamiliar with James Bond films and who had no expectations whatsoever. ""Casino Royale"" is really well-rounded as it provides thrilling action sequences and a superb story that keeps you engrossed while making you feel like you know Daniel Craig's version of James Bond by the time it's over. It was so disappointing ""Quantum of Solace"" wasn't anywhere near the film ""Casino Royale"" was. ""Skyfall"" just really needed to tap into that same sense of greatness ""Casino Royale"" had to keep this franchise as good as its numbers. Judging by its overseas numbers alone (""Skyfall"" made over $321 million before it was even released in the states), it's safe to say ""Skyfall"" more than delivers.

One of the keys to a great James Bond film is a memorable villain. That's one of the reasons ""Quantum of Solace"" was so disappointing; you went from Mads Mikkelsen who cried blood and tortured a nude James Bond with a rope in a chair to Mathieu Amalric who had no charisma and just kind of whined about everything. ""Skyfall"" introduces Javier Bardem as Silva, a former agent who worked for M (Judi Dench). Out of the three Daniel Craig Bond films, Javier Bardem is the best and most mesmerizing villain. Silva is like a more flamboyant Hannibal Lecter who always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else. His speech about getting rid of rats on an island and his mannerisms just sells the character so well. ""Mommy was very bad. Hm?""

""Skyfall"" explores James Bond getting older and whether he's still fit to be an agent after getting injured on the job. To make matters worse is that M has been forced into retirement and only has a few months left until that goes into effect. MI6 comes under attack while a leak is revealing the names of MI6 agents to the world, which has Bond go after Raoul Silva who has a past with M and has every intention of killing her.

By now you've probably already seen it pointed out, but it's really difficult to look past how many similarities ""Skyfall"" has with ""The Dark Knight."" Bardem's performance has more than a few ounces of Heath Ledger's Joker injected into it, Silva plans on being captured and brought into custody, there's a memorable interrogation sequence, Silva disguises himself as a cop, there's a scene that mirrors the ""Nothing in his pockets but knives and lent"" scene in ""The Dark Knight,"" and Bond is an orphan as we see the grave with both parents on it much like Bruce Wayne. Sam Mendes has gone on record as saying ""Skyfall"" was directly influenced by the 2008 film directed by Christopher Nolan, so the homage and similar formula certainly doesn't come out of nowhere.

The opening you've come to expect from these films is delayed as we see Bond on a mission with Eve (Naomie Harris) and events unfolding in a way they didn't plan on. However, the film doesn't break the tradition of a high fueled action sequence opening the film as dirt bikes fly into the camera and the entire train sequence is just extraordinary. The opening credits sequence proves to be just as stylish as ever as we see Bond drowning in what seems like himself and shooting his shadow as we drift along the ocean floor. The film is a visual treat, as well. Everything in Shanghai leaps off the screen thanks solely to the setting and the extreme use of multicolored fluorescent lighting. There's the fight in the skyscraper and the boat ride to the casino. The brilliant cinematography is just as thrilling as the seat-clenching action and incredibly captivating story.

""Skyfall"" puts things back on track after the many shortcomings ""Quantum of Solace"" left us with. Javier Bardem's exceptional performance and his demanding screen presence more than makes up for the follow-up to ""Casino Royale."" ""Skyfall"" is visually impressive from beginning to end, offers what feels like the closing of one exciting Bond chapter and the opening of another, and features some of the most blood pumping action sequences of the Daniel Craig James Bond films. But as excellent as ""Skyfall"" is it still doesn't surpass ""Casino Royale."" The Sam Mendes directed Bond film will have to settle for a well-earned second place trophy.",1352419200,2,4448,4.786458333333333
5036513,4,B006X040NY,"The 50-year old James Bond franchise has come of age. Whilst retaining superbly realized edge-of-the-seat action sequences, `Skyfall' is a pacey and character-driven film with strong script and fine editing; a deeper, darker, more grown-up thriller for a mature audience. It's by far the best of the three Daniel Craig reboots, and a strong contender for the best Bond film to date.

In addition to a complex and absorbing plot full of unexpected twists, both 007 and M are revealed as three-dimensional characters with their own intertwined back-stories, their complex psychological motivations driving essential elements of the narrative. Director Sam Mendes summarized his version of Bond in `Skyfall' as ""a combination of lassitude, boredom, depression and difficulty with what he's chosen to do for a living"".

Although 007 is the hero of the piece he's far removed from any of his predecessors. Here Bond is part-product of a tragic childhood; ruthless, damaged, flawed, unfashionably devoted to country (pay attention to Bond's word-association test at MI6 when he's being assessed for fitness to return to active duty to gain real psychological insight into the character). When recalled to duty he's old, tired, has gotten out of condition and can't shoot straight. The significance of the film's title is revealed only in the epic denouement, which takes us into young James Bond's childhood past and - with the spectacular destruction of the iconic 1960s Aston Martin from the early Connery films - symbolically turns a page in the history and re-defines the franchise for a new generation.

The film might have been less of a success without Javier Barden, who plays the villain of the piece to perfection: genius cyber-terrorist Raoul Silva, a study in complex psychosis from M's murky past. Barden brings genuine creepiness to the role. Sporting dyed blond hair he reprises in part his screen-stealing performance in the Coens' `No Country for Old Men' combined with the more theatrical elements of Batman's Joker. The intelligent and sometimes witty recurrent dialog between Silva and Bond throughout the film is screenwriting excellence.

There are no mediocre performances here. Naomie Harris is perfect as the unambiguously devoted young field agent assisting Bond throughout the action. Just the right amount of sexual frissant between Harris and Craig ensures the triumph of an unexpected but satisfying twist in the final reel, when her real name is revealed (you may know already but if not, this review ain't gonna spoil it for you). Young Ben Wishaw takes Q into new territory with a fine performance as a brilliant but personable cyber-geek whose razor-sharp intelligence and cool-head-in-a-crisis wins Bond's genuine respect. Ralph Fiennes is excellent, emerging as something other than what he initially seems to be, and Judi Dench as vital co-leading character bows out of the series in style with a powerful career-defining performance.

Overall `Skyfall' delivers an absorbing viewing experience on many levels. There's much to savor here: strong, almost novelistic storyline; first-rate performances; fine script; action, mood-perfect soundtrack and - rare in a Bond film - some genuine emotional involvement with the characters who, for once, we start to care about.

Now, Bond 24 is something to look forward to.",1352332800,,3345,5.337760910815939
5036514,4,B006X040NY,"Skyfall in IMAX was a blast. You should all know, however, that this movie was not originally shot with IMAX cameras, it was converted after the fact. The result was still amazing though. While not as crystal clear as movies actually shot on IMAX, we still get to see 26% more of the original captured footage. The IMAX experience of Skyfall was definitely worth it, with the huge picture and extremely loud and immersive surround sound.
From all the reviews out there already, I was expecting this Bond to go a little deeper emotionally, psychologically, and historically into Bond and M's back-stories. You do get a little new material as far as the characters are concerned though. Instead, we get a really good action movie. I appreciated that Skyfall had a slower, more in-control pace unlike Quantum of Solace which, while enjoyable, was just action scene after action scene. The action in Skyfall ranges from fast and chaotic to slow and jazzy like an old school spy movie. I did notice that there was a serious lack of shakey camera movement. For several of the fights you can actually tell who is hitting who and what kind of moves they are doing. It was refreshing.
The cinematography was beautiful and took advantage of all the filming locations. The surround sound was exciting. And the music had its own touch while throwing in deliciously generous bouts of the original Bond music. There are several nods to older Bond movies that were fun to discover and at the same time the movie fits in perfect with Craig's other two outings as 007 with his same character continuing to grow and learn.
The main bad guy wasn't too scary in my opinion. His quirks almost make you like him. He is definitely evil, but I was never really afraid of him. He did an amazing job and was a different take, so that was nice.
Last but not least, how is this movie content/parental concern-wise? It deserved the PG-13 rating it received. Going into Skyfall I was a bit nervous about all the sex scenes and opening music sequence that Bond movies always have. The sex scenes were basically what you see in the trailers with just a few more seconds of footage. The opening musical credit sequence also was not that bad, you definitely don't see as much as in other Bond movies. There were a few outlines of obviously naked women, but they were brief and not that detailed.
As Far as violence is concerned, it was PG-13 spy violence with lots of gunshots and punching and explosions etc. Nothing too graphic here. (No naked torture scenes like in Casino Royale).
And there was one ""F-word"" which was actually not that clearly uttered. Other than that, the rest of the swearing was far below normal PG-13 par.
Thanks for reading, now go enjoy another awesome Bond movie!",1352332800,3,2757,4.674897119341564
5036515,5,B006X040NY,"THIS is the Bond movie I've been waiting for from Daniel Craig.  While I've enjoyed the others, they were a bit heavy, without the light touches that made Bond such a great character for me.  Now, in his third outing in the role, Craig manages to be light and charming in addition to tough as nails.

Skyfall has all the elements of a great James Bond movie.... exotic locales and chases, action, a dash of romance, and a truly memorable villain.  Javier Bardem is charming and menacing, and creates a standout bad guy, the best in several movies, at least.  The supporting cast is top-notch.

More than anything, this story looks at the place of the intelligence operative in modern times, when enemies are not necessarily easy to identify, and when politicians question the continued viability of an aging model of covert operations.  Not only do we get to see Bond and M as age effects them (somewhat) but we are introduced to some of the next generation, who are promising in their own right.

There are laughs, gasps, surprises and nostalgia.....
