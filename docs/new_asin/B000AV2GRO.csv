Yet somehow the digital sequencing and soundtrack are jittery, making it unwatchable and the dialog (no subtitles) incomprehensible. I saw enough to satisfy my curiosity. Velez is sadly miscast as a teenager with grotesque makeup to cover her aging (30 year old!) features. I was hoping she would be given more room to act and sing in a Mexican production contemporary with the Mexican Spitfire series. No such luck.",1367452800,2,563,4.755102040816326
8079936,5,B000AV2GRO,"This movie is very important for many reasons. It is the first Lupe Vlez movie in Mxico after a very long career in the United States, it is the debut as an extra of Mr. Ernesto Alonso, who would later become a very important person in the telenovela world in Mxico's television, and uncredited, Lucha Mara Bautista (Chucho el roto, Corazn bandolero, Los desheredados, Novillero), whose career was cut short after her marriage to one of the performers of the Tro Martnez-Gil...
The cast is superb, the story is good and the costumes are fantastic! The tehuana dresses and marriage tradition are portrayed here with life-like realism. Mara Luisa Zea (showing a little skin before censorship kicked in in the late 40s), Joaqun Pardav, Arturo de Crdova, Conchita Gentil Arcos, are just a few among the excellent performers in this movie! Highly dramatic, Vlez adds a light and funny touch that just enhances the whole experience of watching this movie... Unmissable!",1273449600,7,963,4.987577639751553
