8393841,5,B003BNZILO,"I'm here from ben stiller's spot on the comedy bang bang podcast. it was a good idea, it was necessarily hit and miss - but tightly paced. it was three dollars, but seeing as the proceeds went to a good cause, I didn't hesitate to buy this - even though i'm 26 and perma-broke.  I view this as the cookie you get after donating blood, so I don't really understand the sniveling ingrates giving this one star and wishing to refund their 3 dollars.",1444089600,,446,4.309523809523809

8393843,5,B003BNZILO,"I bought this because my son, Alex Blagg, is one of the tweeters. He's smart, handsome, talented and funny...and as mentiond, is also my son, so I'm a bit biased :)  In addition, the proceeds are for a good cause - Haiti relief - so you get a few laughs while helping.",1357344000,,268,4.153846153846154
8393844,4,B003BNZILO,"There were a few duds in this, not going to lie. But the fast paced momentum makes it very easy to forget the jokes you winced at, and laugh at the ones you do. The celebs walk on stage, say one line, and walk off. Very quick, and considering the length of the video, totally worth the money. You see a lot of faces. The jokes range from completely innocent (retweeting something someone's 60 year old aunt has said) to incredibly, incredibly vulgar (pubic hair was mentioned more than once), but it wasn't anything that made me uncomfortable, at least. It's a video that was fun to watch with friends!",1285891200,,602,4.4818181818181815
8393845,5,B003BNZILO,"I thought this video was hilarious. If you like the cast (an awesome cast, at that), then you'll enjoy watching this whether you're a twitter fan or not. Besides, it's only 3 bucks and the cause is good. Totally worth it in my book.

It's got Aziz Ansari and Ben Stiller in it. Need I say more?",1282608000,2,294,4.157894736842105
8393846,5,B003BNZILO,"A whole bunch of comedians packed into 30 mins, what more could you want?!
I put this in last week when I had a group of friends over, it's short, simple and absolutely hilarious. Twitter is great and all, but it's way better when you can actually hear it from the comedians themselves - or actually see it (nude comedians are always entertaining)",1282521600,,347,4.523809523809524
8393847,1,B003BNZILO,"I've heard a lot about this, and I wanted to see it, but very few of the tweets actually made me laugh. Also, most of the jokes were just gross : / But hey, everyone laughs at different things, you might enjoy it. I'm just saying I wish I hadn't payed, cause it was a waste of money. :( It's for a good cause, though.",1274572800,,317,3.8923076923076922
8393848,1,B003BNZILO,"Rob Huebel is my Hero. I love everything that man has ever done. When i saw he was MCing and promoting this video i had to get it. Unfortunately, along with Paul Sheer, Rob only had one joke at the beginning of the show. It went downhill from there. Its just a bunch of celebrities saying their favorite tweet and leaving. Unfortunately none of the tweets are funny.

I'm glad my man rob is getting bigger, but what a lame, lame, lame, lame, lame video.

At least it was only 3 bucks.

You're welcome Haiti.",1271808000,2,507,4.315789473684211
8393849,4,B003BNZILO,"The idea sounds neat, hearing the best tweets from a great group of people.  It was fun to see such an unusual collection of celebrities: Al Yankovic, Sasha Grey, Ben Stiller, Ed Helms, Martin Starr, and on and on.  I'm sure the tweets look great in print...they just weren't as funny live.  It's worth the 30-minute watch to see the people, and your money goes to a good cause...just don't expect the laughs that you would get from these people in a more traditional comedy show.",1269734400,3,480,4.558139534883721
