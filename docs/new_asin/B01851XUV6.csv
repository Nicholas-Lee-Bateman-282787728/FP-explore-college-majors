7539382,4,B01851XUV6,"For most of ICE SCULPTURE CHRISTMAS, Rachel Boston is so relentlessly chirpy I kept expecting her to speak with this giddy helium voice. But never mind. I dig that she's so positive. It's all the more effective for contrast's sake when, later on in the story, things sour for her character and Rachel Boston has to muster on these devastated faces. So much for raindrops on roses, whiskers on kittens...

For those in need of tips on ice sculpting, this movie is your huckleberry. Boston plays the ever upbeat Callie Shaw who underwent three years of culinary school yet doesn't mind starting from the bottom rung as a dishwasher. It's because she has this opportunity to learn from the gifted head chef Gloria (Brenda Strong). First day at work and Callie is bent on not making waves, on just fitting in. But there's word out that Callie has experience at ice sculpting, and, look, Chef Gloria requires someone to conduct an ice sculpting demonstration for the public. Callie obliges, and then an old childhood friend (sort of) thinks he's doing Callie a favor by signing her up for the 25th Anniversary Ice Sculpture Contest. But it's a contest that Chef Gloria regularly competes in. A mortified Callie tries to back out, except we wouldn't have a movie if she were allowed to back out. Plus, that first prize of $10,000 would pay off almost all of her student loans. My point being, Callie, throughout the movie, goes pretty in-depth in the craft of ice carving.

That well-meaning annoyance who signed up Callie to the contest? That's David Manning (David Alpay), whom she met once when they were kids. David's dad is the king of Wall Street and David, lugging around a business degree from Princeton, aims to follow in his footsteps. He's one of those enthusiastic, exasperating blokes who takes the bull by the horns. And woe is Callie once David makes it his mission to be her one-man support group. Somehow, he ends up as Callie's novice partner in that contest and a willing ear for her patient tutorial on how to find artistry in a block of ice.

There are whiffs of CINDERELLA and SABRINA FAIR. Accordingly, class lines are blurred and crossed over. There's that usual sense of warmth and familiarity that comes hand in glove with a Hallmark product. What stands out to me isn't the boy/girl romance - because ain't nothing new from that front - but, rather, the sweet relationship between Callie and her hard-working, uncomplaining dad (Paul McGillion) who toils for David's domineering father. It's so nice that even though Callie's mom died when Callie was fifteen, she's still such a strong presence in their lives. In fact, one of her mom's unrealized dreams becomes a relevant subplot in the story and becomes key in resolving a thorny conflict that manifests in the third act. Speaking of conflicts, it nags at me when a person happens to peek in at the exact wrong moment to arrive at the most messed-up impression that leads to the big misunderstanding. If only they'd looked in a few seconds before or after, you and I wouldn't have been exposed to such clichd kerfuffle. I know barriers have to be erected before the happy ending, but the Hallmark brain trust sometimes treats displays of originality and creativity like the cooties.

Ah, but dichotomy time. Never mind that tired bit of misunderstanding. And never mind the cartoony villain in the guise of Callie's rival understudy (Leanne Lapp). Rachel Boston is charming and adorable and I love how her face is so expressive. Ultimately, what sticks out the most is that ICE SCULPTURE CHRISTMAS is feel-great entertainment that, like Callie's sumptuous cooking, is easily digestible. Hallmark's holiday movie factory has become a tradition in my household. And, in a roomful of young ones and old ones, the cozy and familiar stuff is to be preferred - unless they lead to stupid misunderstandings. (Wow, I can't let it go.)

But I liked how the contest winner wasn't announced. By that stage, Callie Shaw had already won in life.",1449360000,8,4006,4.82532751091703
7539383,4,B01851XUV6,"During our Holiday season this year this new movie was greatly appreciated by me and so many others which is the first Countdown to Christmas film by Hallmark that I did view. Along with setting the bar a little bit higher for me, I was entertained with the different and even more whimsical feel running throughout it. As I got even cozier with this brand new movie which I was watching, it became more imaginative than some others with a storyline showing that in the long-run, some interesting and original artistry accompanied creative competition would be interwoven into an interestingly different visual experience; something very pleasing to view and warmly received by viewers just like me... And hopefully, you too!

A young woman, Callie Shaw (Rachel Boston), with an unwavering dream since she was just a child is to be an accomplished chef someday. She is now pursuing more menial kitchen tasks such as washing dishes while pushing to get her foot planted in the door of the country club to work her way up the ladder. She had a well-to-do childhood friend, David Manning (David Alpay) while as a youngster has led a life in his fathers shoes who she has met up with now again as an adult. While their younger friendship was shown the film concentrates on their adult lives now, it was an intriguing start to this and not as predictable of a view. The two had been friends while they were young, but now they are adults meeting up again.

I very much enjoyed the differences in this movie while adding their childhood friendship as it then occupied into their adult lives. And director David Mackay broadens out their story a bit more so with an interesting cast. The world that David lives in is much different as far as money and success although he never neglects his feelings for a now struggling Callie. He actually enters her into a team along with him in an ice sculpting contest without her permission knowing that she is fully able to do this wonderfully. This will bolster her self-esteem, but on this occasion her friend David isn't that much help with sculpting. Can these two learn different things from each other? Or could there be a problem when Callie realizes who her direct competition just happens to be while sculpting? Does this interesting cast of characters offer anything different to their new and budding romance? Take a few minutes to learn a little something interesting for yourself Oh, and Happy Holidays to You!",1449100800,4,2456,4.762910798122066
7539384,5,B01851XUV6,"Great movie! You can get it at Walmart for $9.99, and also tis the season for love too!",1448582400,3,87,3.888888888888889
7539385,5,B01851XUV6,"Ice Sculpture is about a woman named Callie Shaw (Rachel Boston) who has had the dream of being a chief ever since she was little.  As a grownup she has a job as a dishwasher at a county club kitchen.  On her first day on the job Callie meets a man named David Manning (David Alpay)  who she met in her childhood. Callie loves making Ice Sculptures. When Callie hears about the ice sculpture contest she is excited but if she enters that means she would be going against  her boss, Gloria (Brenda  Strong). Gloria has never lost the ice sculpture before.  When David enters her in the contest Callie has no choice but be in the contest. David and Callie became fast friends again like when they were kids. The two of the them decide to pair up for the contest. Watch the movie to see who wins the contest.",1448496000,,805,4.298013245033113
7539386,4,B01851XUV6,"Countdown to Christmas returns with a likable romance and reach for your dreams tale that offers all the familiar traits one comes to expect from a Hallmark movie.

Rachel Boston plays Callie an energetic and determined young chef willing to start at the bottom washing dishes in order to hopefully move up in the culinary arts, who meets up with a handsome, rich, childhood friend, David, played by Canadian actor, David Alpay.  Believing in her and her family capabilities in ice sculpting(Of all things!), he enters her, against her wishes, as a team in a sculpting contest.

Now, David doesn't know anything about ice work, but this gives the pair a chance to reconnect and perhaps discover deeper desires.  Of course we know where this is headed, but that's the fun with these Hallmark movies, and this one is well made with the romance developing gently with plenty of interaction between the leads.

There are typical subplots concerning David's relationship with his well to do father and Callie's struggle with a backstabbing colleague.  These provide mild conflict, and the other characters, like Callie's loving father(Scottish born Paul McGillian) and her tough but wise boss(Brenda Strong) and David's faithful, opposite sex friend(a dashing Allyah O'Brian) provide moral support and mild spice to the story.

You also learn some interesting basics about ice sculpting and cooking.  Directed by David Mckay with an excellent cast, the movie pulls all the right Hallmark strings- predicatable but affable with light fun,  harmless drama, and perhaps... a happy ending.

 A good start to the season, now on to the next CTC offering.  Merry Christmas, and have some jelly centered cookies!",1448323200,3,1699,5.160583941605839
7539387,5,B01851XUV6,"This was an enjoyable and interesting movie to watch. Our two main characters Callie and David meet as children but the story's content deals with their adult life and meeting once again.

David has had a life of wealth and following in his father's footsteps even though his heart was not in it. Callie wants to become a chef but the job she takes is one of a dishwasher until she proves herself to the main chef of the country club.

It is a story showing life's challenges, dreams , and believing in oneself. It shows the viewer how your dreams can come true with perseverance and faith in yourself and your abilities. The movie also shows how family love and friendship is more important than one's job.

This is a nice new holiday movie to add to your Christmas movie collection.

7539486,3,B01851XUV6,"This odd Christmas movie has a would-be chef/ice carver (Rachel Boston as Callie) trying to work her way up the ranks, starting as a dishwasher.  Shes intent on impressing another chef but makes a misstep when an old childhood chum (David Alpay as David) enters her into an ice carving competition, putting her in direct opposition to the person she was trying to impress.  Shes eternally optimistic; the rich nitwit pal is enthusiastic, what could go wrong?  A sneaky, underhanded, conniving woman who wants the same job and is willing to do anything to keep Callie from getting it.

A good, harmless (yet uninspiring) story with a bizarre ending that accomplishes nothing.  Whats the point in making a movie about a contest then refuse to announce the winner of said contest!?",1481500800,2,778,4.908396946564886

7539493,4,B01851XUV6,"Although the romantic storyline is a bit predictable, the thing that really makes this movie worth watching are the demonstrations and information about the art of carving ice sculptures. I had no idea the amount of art and science that goes into creating one. You could, of course, do a quick internet search and learn this same information, but the way it is presented as a part of the storyline makes this movie a wonderful one to share with the whole family.",1480723200,2,462,4.646341463414634

However, every once in awhile a movie comes along that strikes an emotional chord with me and that happened with this movie.  The storyline is excellent as was the acting.  It was just the perfect observation of the failures and successes of life and the effect they have on our lives.  It also reminded me of what is possible if we only work together.  I highly recommend this movie.  No weaknesses at all!",1480118400,2,494,4.373626373626373

What was a nice surprise was that this wasn't a film where the boss wasn't keeping an employee down.
