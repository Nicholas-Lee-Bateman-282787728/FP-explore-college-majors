In most cases I find their films to be whimsical, exploratory and expertly constructed, with a deeper resonance of emotion and understanding than most Hollywood attempts at the same. 'Ma Vie' however, is nothing like that past experience, and dissapoints horribly.

I am loathed to say 'art for art's sake' but in this case, I must. The Director has tried to make a film which is innocent, gentle and believing purporting to represent the concerns of adolescence. The construct is around a 16 year old boy who receives his own digital camera for his birthday, and proceeds to record every aspect of his life ad nausea. His story follows the most important people in his life as one would expect, namely his mother, his best friend, a teacher and his step-father. At the same time there is an ever present under-current of self-exploration, which is only revealed late in the film. The direction attempts to show this experience and expression as a 16 year old boy with a camera would, and descends into a shaky at times forced artistic expression. Whilst such direction is fanciful and different, it begs the question.

The cast are surprisingly good, and the young Lucas Bonnifait is a strong presence throughout the film. His step-father whilst saying little has an unnatural obsession with his step-son (ironically there is no formal marriage between him and Etienne's mother) . At moments the audience is disturbed at his actions, although to the Director's credit he does not overtly offend. Similarly, his best friend's inane vanity and lust-filled obsession with girls who he clearly does not respect, makes for an excellent moral comparison with Etienne who is ultimately seeking love and not lust. The fact, that his love is ultimately in the arms of another boy, seems almost an after thought although the audience is made aware of his confusion quite early in the film. Most audiences do not need to be spoon fed, and thankfully French cinema respects this.

Ultimately the film is far too long, and could have been shortened significantly. The constant barrage of inane recordings, make their point early on in the film, and do not need as much repeating. So a 16 year old boy will record the sublime, arbitrary reality of his life.....we get it. Shot after shot of his mother changing, smiling, smoking, walking, working, eating becomes forced and deliberate, and dare I say irritating. The last 30 minutes of the film are the most engaging, as we see Etienne finally find expression. He rages, he descends, he elevates and he finds the love he so desperately seeks, only to have the film end mid-sentence, mid-expression and mid-image. Almost as if the camera died, or the battery expired. If this was intentional, then perhaps it could have been expressed better. I for one was left slightly annoyed, and somewhat unfulfilled. 100 minutes of film, with the fast majority of imagery being repeated themes, leaves one a little dissapointed by such an abrupt end.

In short, I did not enjoy this film in totality. There were moments, albeit brief where I experienced the director's vision and participated in Etienne's life. Most of the time, I was left waiting for the end.",1277856000,,3245,4.90528233151184
