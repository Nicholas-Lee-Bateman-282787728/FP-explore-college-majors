7852089,5,6303589022,"I can not express how important the Wynton Marsalis series ""Marsalis On Music"" where ""Tackling The4 Monster, Wynton On Practicing"" is Part Four of four parts. I wish I had these tools when I was a
Trumpet student as a kid. It is inspiring and opens young musicians eyes, ears and minds to all kinds of music, every kind of music has roots well demonstrated in the ""Marsalis On Music"" series and in Part Four, ""Tackling The Monster"" zeroes in on the absolute necessity for self-disciplined
practice on your instrument whether it is Brass, Guitar, Voice, Drums, Piano or any other.",1303171200,,579,4.742574257425742
7852090,5,6303589022,"All four Marsalis on Music videos are entertaining,educational, and good enough to watch again.  My mom puts his vides on our car video system because of the beautiful music she gets to hear in the background.  My 5 year old sister and I particularly enjoyed Why Toes Tap where he explains the jazz and ragtime beats.  Marsalis relates well to kids.  I play both alto and tenor sax in my junior high school band, and would recommend Toes Tap for lunch time viewing for everyone before band practice.",1096243200,,499,4.636363636363637

It is not only worth watching once, but worth watching every few months. Watching Marsalis and Yo Yo Ma trading licks is alone worth the price!
1. Adults should watch it with their children. If you don't ""play"" you will better understand what your child is going through. That's the more-or-less expected use of the tape.
2. Adults who don't, and never have ""played"" will learn a lot about how musicians are created. You'll appreciate music and musicians all the more. (Even if you don't have a child to watch it with.)
3. Adults who dabble at playing will benefit. This tape is FULL of ""head slappers,"" those things you know, but perhaps never think about. If you are a ""comeback player"" who used to play and is starting again, this tape will remind you of the how and why of practicing. Practicing IS a monster. I hadn't played for 35 years, and have a lot of other things to do. The tape got me excited about practicing, even if I don't want to. Who does?
I STRONGLY suggest that music teachers ask their students to watch this tape with their parents, then discuss it with the family. The tape will entertain everyone, help the whole family, and probably produce a better young musician.
GRANDPARENT/UNCLES AND AUNTS - give it as a gift.",1042588800,19,1405,4.669354838709677
