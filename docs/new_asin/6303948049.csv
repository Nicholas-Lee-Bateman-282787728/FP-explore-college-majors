737577,4,6303948049,"If you like Antonio Banderas, this is a great movie for you!  He is wonderfully sexual in this movie, and the one scene that stands out is right after Rebecca returns to his apartment and slaps him....it had me so...well, lets just say it was really good!  If you can watch a movie for its entertainment value, and not pick it apart for its cinematic quality and reality quirks, then you will enjoy this movie.  It does have a plot, and a good one, and the ending is a little bit of a let down, but other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Antonio is at one of his sexiest in this movie!  He had me captivated the whole time!  Watch for that particular scene, you won't be disappointed!",1031011200,8,688,4.294573643410852
737578,5,6303948049,"I really liked the plot and directing and acting in this movie. I thought this was one of Ms. DeMornay's greatist dramatic roles I've seen her in. No corny bimbo performance here, great dramatic acting combined with good soundtrack and storyline! It has mystery,intrigue,romance, and spice! I'll even use a word I don't usually use and say the ""lovescene"" playing in the snow and flashing back and forth was the best I've ever scene in a movie! Ms. DeMornay is underrated and all the nude scenes I've seen of her are classy and in good taste, unlike other actresses! I'd prefer her to keep her clothes on myself because of all the morons out there who only get off onTV nudity because no real women wants anything to do with them! Again she's a great actress! Keep making movies Rebecca, I'll watch them even if on a viewfinder! Your the best!",1025913600,5,843,4.589403973509934
737579,5,6303948049,"Rebecca DeMornay plays a beautiful but serious(note the reading glasses) psychologist who has a mysterious background concerning the loss of her mother as a small child. Dennis Miller is the suspicious ex-boyfriend and neighbor. Antonio Banderas is the sexy guy she runs into while shopping and begins dating. Lots of disturbing things begin to happen to her and she suspscts someone is going to try to kill her. The ending was a surprise twist to me. There are some steamy scenes between her and Antonio which are worth the purchase of the DVD in my opinion. You can watch it in English, Spanish or Portuguese and it also has subtitles in Chinese, Korean and Thai. The DVD features full or widescreen format, trailers and chapter selection.",1008806400,11,741,4.888888888888889
737580,5,6303948049,"I thought it was a very good movie. To the viewers from Denver and the other place, I bet neither one of you have ever been naked with areal woman before or even know how to treat a real woman. I thougt Rebecca DeMornay was outstanding especially at the end when she relapsed back to her childhood and then came back to the present. I think Rebecca DeMornay has more guts to try different roles than any other actress in Hollywood. You have to look beyond her good looks and appreciate her range and ability. The other ""quote hot actresses"" are just damsels in distress packaged in different outfits. Rebecca's range and guts are unmatched in my opinion. I'd take Tonya over Julia Roberts any day. Rebecca's the best in my book. Jim.",983750400,8,733,4.518796992481203
737581,3,6303948049,"The opening credits list Ms. DeMornay as the producer; at this point I knew the movie wouldn't be particularly deep or heavy, and so I wasn't disappointed.
Neither Ms. DeMornay nor Mr. Banderas are known for deep or  heavy.  What I expected was light, not very complex, but entertaining and  sexy.  This movie met those expectations.  As always, Ms. DeMornay was  beautiful, sexy, and occasionally naked; this is what she's very good at.  My only criticism is that she should have gotten naked a little more often.",947548800,4,514,4.839080459770115
737582,5,6303948049,"This is one of Antonio Banderas' best movies.  He and Rebecca DeMornay have a a strong chemistry between them, and it shows.  The movie was very interesting and had a very unexpected ending!! There was a good combination  of mystery, suspense and sex.  I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a  thrill!!!",939772800,6,308,4.735849056603773

Sadly, the shot cuts off at the crazy old lady beside me and I am not in the scene.
Ah well.
Fun times, regardless.
Oh...it's an awful movie.
Don't bother unless you dig Rebecca DeMornay biting Antonio Banderas' bare ass.

737904,4,6303948049,Antonio exuded sex on this thriller. Story line a bit expected but a few twists out of the normal series of events. Worth the time to watch but won't go down in the memory bank as one to remember.,1415836800,,196,4.051282051282051
737905,1,6303948049,Transparent plot. Antonio Banderas is gorgeous but he delivers his lines like he doesn't understand them. Rebecca De Mornay is also gorgeous /she doesn't do much better.  If they weren't both so damn gorgeous I wouldn't have watched it to the end. Very much a B movie . Maybe in the 60s this slock would have been considered a startling twist....maybe not.,1404432000,,356,4.741935483870968

737989,4,6303948049,"I liked this movie, didn't like the graphic sex in it, not a movie for young viewers. On the Pro side, it is a good thriller movie and has a great ending.",1373673600,,154,3.84375
737990,5,6303948049,"I loved it, what a sizzler I'm a big fan of Antonino.anytime he is so sexy wow would love to meet him one day.",1355443200,,110,3.625
737991,3,6303948049,"This thriller is a bit rough-edged, but a lot of people like that sort of thing. Rebecca DeMornay was the at the top of her game around this time (early to mid '90s).

On the plus side, this is an interesting and involving story, especially in the second half of the film. The movie is capped by a surprise ending I defy anyone to guess correctly. There are a few steamy scenes, too.

The bad news is that there are no likable characters, too much profanity; a few minor holes in the story; and an obvious as sexist bias against men.  DeMornay's foul mouth and morals are pretty rotten for a psychologist, the character she plays. The guys, played by Dennis Miller and Antonio Bandaras, are pretty sleazy characters, too.",1238025600,2,721,4.530769230769231

737993,1,6303948049,"How can that evil blonde woman kill her own orange cat? The dead cat looked like a silly stuffed animal with ketchup on it. Terrible effects.

By the way, the blonde lady killed the kitty and she was stalking herself cuz her daddy killed her mommy when she was little.

waste of movie.",1190764800,,285,4.3584905660377355
737994,2,6303948049,"I knew going in, when I saw that DeMornay was the exec producer of this film, that this was going ot be good. Good, as in the thrill of bearing witness to a train wreck.

Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) is a controversial diagnosis. Some of the worlds top shrinks don't believe in it and neither will you after watching this film.

Watch this film only if you enjoy being a spectator at car wrecks or watching amputees jump from a burning hospital.

That millions of dollars were wasted in order to pinch this loaf off is the only believable crime you will see in this film.",1190332800,,578,4.433962264150943
737995,3,6303948049,"NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS is what is commonly referred to as an ""erotic thriller"", although it's eroticism is skimpy and the thrills don't come too often.  Rebecca DeMornay (Risky Business, Trip to Bountiful) plays a repressed psychiatrist who is evaluating alleged serial killer Harry Dean Stanton to see if he should stand trial for his accused crimes.  Stanton claims he is a multiple personality disorder victim and therefore can plead innocent due to insanity.  DeMornay has a chance encounter with sexy Antonio Banderas and starts into a relationship with him.  This alienates her best friend Dennis Miller who has been carrying a torch for DeMornay for some time.  DeMornay starts receiving strange things in her mail:  dead flowers, her dead cat, etc., etc., and soon it seems DeMornay may be the victim herself of a dangerous stalker.  Is it Banderas? Miller? or perhaps even her estranged father (Len Cariou).  Once all the secrets are peeled away, things aren't quite what they seem.  While definitely not in the league of truly suspenseful films, NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS offers a sharp performance from DeMornay and Cariou particularly, and Banderas is effectively smoldering.  Astute viewers, however, will see the end coming a mile away.",1127952000,13,1249,5.169154228855722
7856663,1,6303948049,"Very strange, raunchy movie. A lot of unnecessary raunchiness. It just boggles my mind how anyone could like this movie because the plot makes no sense and it is just all over the place.",1524096000,,186,4.5
