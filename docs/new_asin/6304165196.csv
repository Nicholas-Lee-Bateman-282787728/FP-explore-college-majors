7864260,5,6304165196,"I have watched this movie five or six times, and I love it. I made up 75 questions on it for my classes, and they loved it, too. It is so interesting. I love the way they had everything about the Arctic with the wolf and the Antarctic with the penguin. The video mentions at least four works of literature that we also studied. I really enjoyed the movie and it led me to create an entire unit. Scholastic had an Arctic unit idea that I also used, having the kids write diary entries, one of which was written in sparkly gel pen for the bulletin board. Thank you DK for another quality product.",1295654400,2,594,4.219298245614035

It shows insects up close and explains a lot of the""ickiness"" about them in a format that is interesting to children.  Our kids are less intimidated because the understand why spiders spin web.  They are fascinated by them now, instead of afraid.",1135555200,2,342,4.947368421052632
7864262,5,6304165196,"This is an excellent way to introduce the Class Insecta to-""I hate science!""-students. It grabs their attention and at the same time provides them with correct and useful information on creepy crawlers. Hint:  Eyewitness has videos on  many other animal classes:retiles-fish-birds-etc.  I have never been disappointed with the reactions of my students towards  these wonderful videos.",948153600,10,384,5.803571428571429
