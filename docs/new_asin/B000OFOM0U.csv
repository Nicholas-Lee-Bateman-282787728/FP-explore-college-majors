8184841,4,B000OFOM0U,"One look at Brain Blockers' cover art should tell you what sort of movie to expect, and it doesn't let you down.  I've never met a Zombie movie I didn't like at least a little, and Brain Blockers is no exception.  Rising star Ned Liebl stands out with a quality performance above and beyond your B-movie expectations.  It's not ""Atonement"", but you didn't expect it to be, did you?",1202428800,2,381,4.492753623188406
