8677956,5,B00NGAJEIK,Computer Science and coding is not going away any time soon.  This is a great resource into Cyber Security and what exactly you are risking when you use the world wide web.,1490227200,,172,4.375
8677957,5,B00NGAJEIK,"This is a well-produced, if a little technical, documentary on the current state of issues related to the internet and the security of one's identity on the internet. In a short span of under an hour, it covers four major issues related to security - namely, identity theft and data destruction, the super virus called Stuxnet, which set the Iranian nuclear weapons program back by destroying centrifuges, Quantum Computing and finally, Ultra Paranoid computing. The first three items are quite familiar to me, having followed the first two when they were exposed in technology magazines and the third as a point of general interest in the future of computing. But 'Ultra Paranoid Computing' was something I had not even heard of before and I found it a captivating part of the documentary. Though there is a bit of mathematics and physics thrown about in the sections on identity theft and quantum computing while explaining cryptography and how at the quantum level, a particle exists at two different locations at exactly the same instant, the documentary is understandable to the general viewer as far as the implications of its message is concerned. If at all anything, it will scare the non-technical computer user away from his keyboard!

The identity theft issue shows how the Twitter account of Mat Honan, a tech writer of 'Wired' magazine, was compromised by a bunch of teenagers who simply destroyed his digital history and posted racist tweets on his Twitter account. Honan actually had strong passwords for his accounts. But his accounts on Amazon, Apple, Google and Twitter were invaded through ordinary human failings called 'social engineering exploits'. The primary problem lay in Honan daisy-chaining all his accounts such that if one was compromised, then others could easily be as well. His Amazon and Apple accounts were compromised by the teenage hackers simply by calling up the respective help desks to do things whose implications the help desk guys didn't anticipate!

Stuxnet was a super virus, thought to be designed and deployed by the US and Israeli governments to destroy Iranian centrifuges in their Natanz nuclear facility. Even though the nuclear facility was not connected to the internet, the documentary shows how the virus was installed on its network through the simple use of an USB drive containing the virus. So, in some ways, this also was a security breach using the social engineering exploit. The section on quantum computing shows how the quantum property of being simultaneously in multiple locations is used in super-fast processing and cracking cryptographic codes, thereby invalidating many of the security measures used by banks and other websites in ensuring the validity of our transactions today.

But it was 'Ultra Paranoid computing' that I found really cool. It is an attempt to protect our online life by not trusting anyone - absolutely no one and absolutely no machine - , including ourselves! Instead of relying on encryption and the password technology, it depends on the Basal Ganglia part of our brain to identify ourselves to the computer! The basal ganglia is located in the cerebral cortex and it plays a key role in learning and formation of habits when we engage in learning to drive or swim or play tennis and so on. When we repeatedly ride a bike, for example, a long-term muscle memory is created for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed without conscious effort. This part of the brain is not accessible by our conscious self. Ultra Paranoid Computing involves not only validating a person'e identity by using this feature of the brain but also in keeping it from getting compromised because even we cannot transfer it to someone when we are conscious!

It is an enjoyable and spooky documentary for all, including the non-technical person.",1447200000,4,3827,5.06984126984127
8677958,3,B00NGAJEIK,"Some interesting material here about the world of hacking. I thought the detour into the world of quantum mechanics was also fascinating, if a tad oblique to understand sometimes. Hearing the mathematical background of prime numbers and so on and the role they play in encryption made me feel sorry for ever having used a password of ""password"" in the past",1444262400,,356,4.852459016393443

8677960,5,B00NGAJEIK,Awesome and I truly loved this product!!!,1435449600,,41,5.0
8677961,5,B00NGAJEIK,"Excellent, so interesting.  I especially loved learning about how important math and Primary Numbers are in fighting hackers.  I would recommend this to any student who doesn't understand why math is so important and even exciting.",1434931200,3,231,5.388888888888889
8677962,4,B00NGAJEIK,"Program begins with detailed and lucid coverage of the use of prime numbers for encoding data sent across the Internet. It then went on to quantum computing, paranoid cryptography and other complex methods currently being developed and on the frontiers of science. The 'bad news' is that most of the latter material was beyond my comprehension, though it least familiarized me with the terminology and general ideas.",1432339200,5,416,5.223880597014926
8677963,4,B00NGAJEIK,Good to see what actually happened,1421884800,,34,4.833333333333333
8677964,5,B00NGAJEIK,"Yes this presentation is unnerving to people trying to keep data safe. However it goes way beyond that to cyber wars and quantum computers, using Q-bits. Then goes way beyond to some exotic speculations.

It has people talking about personal experiences. We even get pretty detailed information on how to. We get clear diagrams.

This is worth the purchase as you can slow down and pick up some interesting information and have time to think about it.",1411689600,10,451,4.8441558441558445
8677965,5,B00NGAJEIK,"The first individual that you get to see in this DVD is an associate of WIRED magazine whose accounts are hacked. This individual with all Apple devices ends up losing it all from his emails, emails of people no longer alive, his daughter's pictures and everything else by few teenage hackers, all of it in just forty five minutes. One should wonder why anyone regardless of their status but especially in this case , a journalist working for WIRED magazine never attempted to back up all those data on  external  hard drive. After all he is suppose to be more informed about hacking when he is already making a living in the same industry. Apple certainly gets some free promo there although that this guy's case is more confusing than those female celebrities who didn't keep their nude photos on external hard drive either which gave them more exposure anyway.

While confused, the documentary takes you to the next guy, then the next guy and so on where the whole scenario of accessing data becomes through the conscious and subconscious mind which puts every next individual in this documentary on a plateau so different than the previous guy. In the end, it just deviates from any mind and gets down to the simple basic act of accessing data by introducing the hacker's program through an external hard drive which makes this documentary interesting to watch.",1411603200,5,1365,4.8
