7889920,5,6305454590,"These videos are the ultimate in extreme skiing.  The soundtracks are really good too.  I saw it for the first time in Big Sky, Montana on a hotel's private theater.  It was great!  This movie is a definate winner.  Warren should get a gold medal for it.  THIS IS A BUY.",945129600,5,270,4.196078431372549
7889921,5,6305454590,"Wow.
First, I've seen 50, the new Warren Miller movie for 1999-2000, and it's incredible.  His movies, like these I'm reviewing, are wonderful.  The ski industry should give him some kind of ""Snow King""  crown.
Second, on the bus from Jackson Hole, traveling to Grand Targhee,  the driver showed freeriders, then snowriders, as he drove there and back.  The whole bus was silent, oohing and awwing as scene after unimaginable  scene played before our eyes. We swayed, ducked, and screamed with the  action.  These movies are fantastic!  They are a great way to plan your  next vacation too.
Third, and last, part of the magic is Warren's  understated narrative, and his ability to turn a phrase into much more.  His team of photographers and ""slope heads"" can't be beat either.  These are snow films everyone can enjoy.",943833600,10,819,4.890510948905109
7889922,5,6305454590,"What else would you expect from the founder of extreme skiing videos other than another great ""snowriding"" experiance. Buy this set and you will not be disapointed. Go see his 99-00 feature film ""50""",943315200,9,199,4.882352941176471
7889923,5,6305454590,"As an avid skier and devoted Warren Miller fan, I loved this film! It is by far his best yet, and that says a lot for a legend with 50+ years devoted to filming this type of action. A must-see for anyone who enjoys  skiing/boarding/et al.",912988800,2,238,4.173913043478261
7889924,5,6305454590,"I finished watching this movie (the first time) at 8:30 PM and couldn't wait until the sun came up so that I could head out and carve some turns.  I was into snow sports before but after watching this I'm hooked deep.  Warren Miller combines excellent video, wonderful music and some of the  best skiing, snow boarding, and mountain biking (yes bikes, they are just  part of the unique snow rides you will see).  If your spouse is kind of  so-so about your snow affection, sit her/him down and watch this video!",912556800,2,511,4.5
