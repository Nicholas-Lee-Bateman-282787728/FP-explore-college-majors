1255951,3,B00002SSKW,"This movie has a hypnotic effect upon the viewer due largely to the subtle acting by Mark and Michael Polish who play enigmatic conjoined twins.  An equally enchanting performance is given by Michele Hicks who plays the  proverbial prostitute with the heart of gold.  The film has an intriguing  look to it that greatly adds to its effect upon the viewer.  The commentary  on the DVD offers edifying insight into how these two brothers wrote,  directed, and created the visual moods and images.  I look forward to the  next creation of the Polish brothers.",950140800,5,556,4.829787234042553
1255952,5,B00002SSKW,"""Twin Falls Idaho"" opens with a hooker, Penny, being handed a two-dollar bill from a handicapped cab driver; he has a hook in place of his hand and Penny's shallow friend, Francine, is so appalled by his abnormality that  she allows Penny to keep her change just so she doesn't have to take the  money from his clamp. Penny, on the other hand, takes the bill, studies it  for a moment in awe, then exits the cab (this foreshadows many things to  come).
She enters a hotel that, despite its look, is in some way  comforting, and is the hideaway of the Falls Brothers; Two good-looking,  often soft spoken conjoined twins, who have come to die together, so were  told later in the film. Blake is the healthy one of the two, while Francis  is ill and suffers from a weak heart.
Upon seeing Blake and Francis,  Penny is frightened and leaves. Forgetting her purse, she must come back  for it and thus starts the relationship of the three. It's a love story,  but not in the way that you'd think. It's more of a love story between the  brothers than it is between the two of them and Penny.
One thing I liked  about Penny's character is that she is a little superficial, but knows it,  which may in fact be the reason why she has a sort of fascination with the  brothers. She finds them in a coffee shop on Halloween night (the one night  they can be normal) and takes them to a party. Her friend Francine, from  earlier in the cab, thinks she's weird and has a hard time believing she's  taken a liking to Blake and Frances. Her  photographer friend, of course,  wants to take their picture for a magazine when he finds out their actual  Siamese twins.
She cares for them and tries to protect them. She is  curious about them and even calls a close doctor friend by the name of  Miles to examine them when Francis is feeling sick in the beginning of the  film. Naturally, her kindness brings into play strong feelings from both  Blake and Francis. While Francis may have been the one to call her to their  hotel room for his brother on his birthday, it is also their birthday, and  one might think he quietly hoped for her affection too.
This is the kind  of movie where your watching because your intrigued by the characters.  Namely the Brothers, who are so calm and quiet, that there presence creates  the tone of the movie, thus drawing Penny and the audience into their  story.
We imagine what it would be like to be that close with somebody,  and yet knowing their closeness is by nature and not choice, we feel their  mutual need to be near Penny, who is their by choice.
And when it is  clear that Francis may not live much longer, Penny becomes more than just a  curator; she becomes what Blake will need and has needed his whole life --  someone to fill his void; his loneliness. It is a sad story, but also  touching, and in its own way, is one of the best overlooked films over the  year.",949795200,10,2896,4.353932584269663
1255953,4,B00002SSKW,"This is the first feature from the Polish brothers, but it surely won't be their last.  It's a sombre, introspective, low-key film about conjoined twin brothers and their relationship with Penny, a small-town hooker with,  alas, the proverbial heart of gold.  In accordance with a movie convention  dating back at least to Pretty Woman, model-turned-actress Michelle Hicks  plays a prostitute who somehow barely earns enough money to rent a one-room  apartment.
The film adheres to convention in several other ways, but  succeeds nonetheless, and manages eloquently to convey universal themes  through characters born into the most unique circumstances.  The scene of  the brothers singing a duet for Penny, with cooperative guitar  accompaniment, is almost magical.",948931200,4,766,5.573913043478261

1255955,5,B00002SSKW,"Rarely has an American independent filmmaker emerged with such a spellbinding first feature. The film unfolds its fabulous tale gently allowing  the brothers separate emotional lives where nature  confused  their bodies. The film is about support rather than dependence, about  caring rather than  exploitation. Whether seen as a spiritual fairytale, a  meditation on love, or simlpy the most unusual narrative, Twin Falls Idaho  is a deeply haunting film that works its audience into believing the most  extraordinary story.",948412800,5,525,5.641025641025641
1255956,4,B00002SSKW,"In comparing ""Twin Falls Idaho"" to the other films in its very narrow genre (indie or foreign films dealing with conjoined male twins) it shines through as being far more sympathetic to its characters.  It is also  pleasing the way it glides gracefully between dark humor and drama.  Unlike  Peter Greenaway's brilliant if lurid ""A Zed and Two Naughts"" (1985), this  quiet little film is light and refreshing in places.  It explores its  characters very thoroughly, giving the audience more than just heavy-handed  symbolism to consider.  ""Twin Falls Idaho"" lacks the budget or scope of  drama that made David Cronenburg's ""Dead Ringers"" such a treat.  You must  keep in mind this is a first film for the Polish Brothers and I think it  shows great promise.  With the success of such brother filmmaking teams as  the Cohens and the Wachowskis, I think these guys have a bright future.",948240000,5,884,4.878378378378378
1255957,5,B00002SSKW,"""Twin Falls Idaho"" is a dream-haunter of a film! Lovingly and meticulously directed by Michael Polish and written with quiet brilliance by Mark Polish (with help from twin brother Michael), this gentle,  soft-spoken film is one of the three best films of 1999. The imagery in the  film is sometimes warm and dreamlike, but more often gritty and stark,  pointing out subtext to the audience without utilizing masks or shadows.  It's a wonderful story about the nature of relationships: about love and  marriage and ""divorce""; and about the lives of those unfortunates  society labels as ""different"", and the realization that they are  not so different as society may have initially supposed. The acting is  superb; the Polish brothers are completely believable as the conjoined  twins Blake and Francis Falls, performing feats like deftly buttoning up  each other's shirts or playing the guitar together (Blake strums while  Francis manages the fret for chord changes) as if they had, indeed, done it  all their lives. As the film rolled on, I found myself loving these two  guys as unique and colorful individuals, and empathizing with their unique  plight. And the often-utilized ""Hooker with a Heart"" character  Penny is given new light and life by Mark Polish's careful crafting of the  character and by Michelle Hicks edgy yet warm performance. If you're like  me, ""Twin Falls Idaho"" will leave you awake nights, thinking long  and long. I look forward to seeing what the Polish brothers will do next,  either collaboratively or on their own.",948153600,29,1546,5.087649402390438
1255958,5,B00002SSKW,"I walked into the theatre a little apprehensive, but this movie really works.  It's how perfection doesn't count from the outside when love is the purest subject from the inside.  I have never been close to relating their  hardships, but feel that humanity is quite possibly the only thing that  brings us solice in life.  These bright directors, actors, writers..you  name it, have found me calling this my top choice this year for best  indie-picture.  This year also goes to American Beauty and Being John M.  I  haven't yet seen Sleepy Hollow, but most non-Batman movies from Burton are  always quite interesting.",943747200,5,617,4.950980392156863
1255959,5,B00002SSKW,"Michael and Mark Polish play conjoined twins Blake and Francis Falls, who start this movie in a run down hotel room in a big city.  They'd come to find their mother who had offered them for adoption at birth upon learning of their deformity.

In the opening scenes, we meet Penny, a prostitute who has been called by the brothers.  This is one thing I never understood about this movie - it is rated ""R"" yet there are no sex scenes in it, however this movie isn't one for the ""PG"" crowd either because it does take maturity and understanding.

As the movie proceeds, the bonds between Penny and the brothers grow.

I can't say enough about how touching and sweet this movie is.  This is not my usual sort of interest when it comes to films but it is brilliantly executed and wonderfully acted by all involved.

If you've ever experienced not exactly fitting in, you'll like this movie.  It's one of my favorites, definitely.  If you have not seen this movie, you are really missing out on one of the finest American films.",1188518400,2,1022,4.481081081081081
1255960,5,B00002SSKW,"Twin Falls Idaho (Michael Polish, 1999)

Sometimes after I see a film, I want to run out and tell the world about how great it is. Other times, I just have to sit there, with no muscle control or brain function, and wait for the movie to sink in. As the closing scenes of Twin Falls Idaho played out before me, I sat, drooling on myself a little, and just stared.

It's that good.

Blake and Francis Falls (Michael and Mark Polish of Hellraiser: Bloodline) are siamese twins who live in a fleabag hotel. For their birthday, they call an escort service; Penny (The Sheld's Michele Hicks in her film debut) arrives. At first disturbed by their condition, she eventually comes to like them, and convinces them to venture outside their shell. The rest of the world, however, are not quite as understanding as Penny.

Mark and Michael Polish are just brilliant in their roles, and they're backed up by a stable of exceptionally talented actors (Lesley Ann Warren, William Katt, Garrett Morris, Jon Gries, and Sasha Alexander, among many others, show up in roles of varying sizes). The acting talent alone would make it work as an odd, avant-garde stage play. What makes it work as a film is Michael Polish's vision-- not only his sympathy for the subject matter, which can be taken as a given, but his way of presenting it. Polish wanders off into little symbolic, almost magic-realist scenes every once in a while to complement the subtle symbolism contained in the rest of the film, but he never overdoes it; a couple of the scenes get perilously close to cheesily sentimental, but never quite cross the line. (This, though, is the most heavily-debated opinion about the movie, specifically in relation to the bicycle scene-- if you liked that, then you're probably going to love the movie.)

At its heart, though, it's another movie about a love triangle, albeit one with an interesting and original twist, and one that's presented just shy of perfectly. A fantastic film. **** ",1166572800,5,1976,4.7631578947368425
1255961,5,B00002SSKW,"I would not exactly call myself a softy, but this movie touched just about every emotion possible.

I consider myself a typical guy, and therefore stopped while channel surfing late one night to check out 'Penny'. After a few minutes I brought on the info. on the movie and thought I would check out a little more since the description indicated that the 'hooker' was going to seduce the twins. Ok, what the hell, I'll hang around a bit just to see some skin... Penny is pretty hot.

But within ten minutes I was captured by both the performance of the characters and the writing. Absolutely not the 'run of the mill' kinda of movie. This was so much more than the 'sleaze' I was expecting. This movie is so thought provoking and emotional that I literally had tears in my eyes by the end of the movie. Boy, am I'm glad my girlfriend was not around. Then again, maybe that would have been a GOOD thing.

Anyway, after the movie ended I felt ashamed about what I was expecting, that is after I blew my nose.  This was way more of an intimate EXPERIENCE. It'll stick with you for a while.",1146009600,14,1086,4.361386138613861

1255963,5,B00002SSKW,"From the restrained colors, music, pacing, acting - every element of this movie was perfectly thought out and perfectly connected.
Including the Polish Brothers in their role as conjoined twins.  They allow a peek inside what it is like to be a twin in the first place - but taking it to the most extreme example of two twin brothers that love and hate one another.  And live with the knowlege that the weaker of the two has very little time left to live.
And they delicately touch on all the little things that two attached people face daily - from their sleeping routines, to time in the bathroom, being a spectacle in public, their tender love for one another, and the one twin falling in love.
I picked up the movie on a whim, thinking it would be comedic freakshow material.  It turned out to be so much better than my expectations.",1072137600,17,837,4.457516339869281
1255964,1,B00002SSKW,"While in some ways an interesting look at a subject that has not been explored much (at all?) in film, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.
The script, direction, acting and cinematography are self-conscious to the point of being over-the-top. There are numerous scenes where you could say ""ah I see that's supposed to symbolise THAT"" - there is nothing subtle about Twin Falls Idaho, regardless of its slow pace. Everything is delivered to us with a film-school handbook about metaphors and mood lighting.
People have compared the Polish brothers to David Lynch and other directors of his style. Unlike David Lynch's films, this one leaves NOTHING to the imagination. It just looks like it does.",1063756800,6,715,4.821138211382114

1255966,4,B00002SSKW,"Penny is a prostitute and twin brothers Blake and Francis are a couple of her tricks.  The only hitch in the connection is that the brothers are conjoined twins.  Penny is initially repelled, but then is drawn back into their world.  She plays healer and assists the brothers while one of them recovers from a heart ailment.  Slowly, but surely she falls for Blake.  She becomes their protector and their tormentor too.
Real twin brothers  - the Polish brothers - portray Blake and Francis.  The two of them wrote the script, and brother Michael directed.  This is their first film, though it will surely not be their last.  What should be a horrible mess of a production merely based on its odd, off-center subject matter, is a hypnotic view of conjoined twins.  The Polish brothers portray their roles so well, that I wanted to know how they managed to find conjoined twins so attractive and with such strong acting ability.  In other words, it is a credit to their craft that they had a sad skeptic such as myself, believing that they were really conjoined twins.
With supporting roles (or enlarged cameos) are Garrett Morris and Lesley Anne Warren.
This film is not fluff.  It takes us on a journey where we know that tragedy must come.  But as Blake says,""There are no sad endings, only endings where the storyteller stopped telling the story.""
You really shouldn't miss this one!",1058745600,6,1385,4.720833333333333
1255967,4,B00002SSKW,"This is one of those delightful little gems that you frequently find on the independant film channel and well worth owning. Real life twins playing the part of joined from birth siamese twins has a certain appeal and it is enjoyable to find a movie with a different theme. This is not your typical film.
The first issue with this film is whether the twins seem real. If you can't believe that they really are siamese twins the movie will fall flat. In this case the Polish brothers are very believeable. In fact you begin to think they are not acting. You will be captivated by these two young men. You will constantly be looking at how similar they look yet you will also notice the little differences. I think that is why the movie moves at the pace it does. You need time to just watch. See how they interact. While watching this your mind is working constantly as you imagine yourself being born that way and living that way.
The basic themes of the film are:
Freaks; the movie focuses on how people are different and the message is that all of us are different somehow therefore nobody is really a freak and the brothers are not as well. It's not what is different about the Fall brothers that matters but what is good about them. The problem with the film is that while attempting to show us their humanity the main focsu is on their uniqueness. You never stop thinking about it. It never melts away. This theme is brought out in a costume party the twins attend where everyone thinks they are just in costume posing as siamese twins. Finally you get to be like everyone else Penny says.
Another theme is the sexual energy that exists between the brothers and a hooker friend called Penny. While initially repulsed by them she eventually develops strong feelings and attraction for them. An affair takes place but it is handled so delicately that it never interferes with the flow of the film. There is nothing kinky here. No overt pornographic images. No foul language pertaining to sex. Significant considering that Penny is a hooker. Penny has grown as a person because of her relationship with the twins.
Loneliness:
Everyone in the picture is lonely. Penny is a loney, unloved street hooker. The twins are lonely despite having each other right there. The twins mother lives alone and unhappy in a strange orange apartment.
Overall a good movie and you can tell much effort was put into this by the Polish brothers. If there is anything wrong with the picture it would be that it is too depressing. The movie doesn't make you feel hopeful. One twin is finally freed from his prison by being seperated from his brother but it is only because his brother dies. Instead of an emphasis on the new found life as an individual we see the man broken and and in grief over his lost brother. Why do the brothers live in that flee bitten hotel room? Gainful employment and a productive life are not a possibility? Instead of presenting us with a story of someone who over came their difficulties all we see is the misery and depair. The message here is that life sucks rather than life can be anything you make of it.
Still a good film.

From the opening, viewers are intrigued and fascinated by this  story, beautifully directed and acted. Blake and Francis Falls are two guys  who are trying to exist. Francis wonders if Blake would be better off  without him.
A prostitute, free of the concerns most of us would have  with conformity and perception, accepts and befriends the twins, and the  story moves from there. Like many have indicated this could be the plot  line for some peep show flick. It is not.
The issues of disabilities,  insensitivity, brotherhood, individuality are dealt with here in a kind and  affectionate manner. The writing is sweet and the acting superb. Watch it  and think about it...a nice film.",968457600,2,1052,4.971264367816092
1255986,4,B00002SSKW,"`Twin Falls Idaho' proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that love stories do indeed come in every shape, size and form. This low budget, independent  film actually tells two love stories: one between two brothers conjoined  together from birth and the other between them and a golden-hearted  prostitute who befriends them.
This movie is an obvious labor of love on  the part of the filmmakers. Writer/director Michael Polish and his real  life identical twin brother, Mark, who co-wrote the screenplay, also star  as Francis and Blake Falls, a pair of Siamese twins who, on their birthday,  order up a hooker played by newcomer Michelle Hicks. Though initially  frightened away by the `freakishness' of the situation, the young lady,  Penny, finds herself growing attached to these two painfully quiet and  withdrawn young men who seem to have a strange symbiotic relationship she  is unable to comprehend but which, in some strange way, speaks to a  yearning for companionship lodged deep within her own troubled soul. The  film becomes a moving study of three social outcasts groping towards each  other for support and affirmation.
In many ways, the most striking  aspect of the film is the quiet, hushed tone it uses to unfold a drama that  could, by its very nature, easily succumb to cheap sensationalism and  exploitation. Blake and Francis, so long conditioned by a lifetime of  societal rejection to draw into themselves and stay conveniently out of  sight, have created a private universe where they barely ever speak above a  whisper. Penny, herself lost in a cold, uncaring world, seems instinctively  drawn to the innate goodness and politeness of the two men and she quickly  learns to look beyond the physical difference that has served as a barrier  between them and so many others. The film also does not go for the obvious  choices one might expect in a work about misunderstood social outcasts; it,  wisely, refrains from ladling on emotionally manipulative scenes in which  people stare rudely at the pair or in which opportunistic exploiters work  their wiles on the boys. Although the film does touch on both those issues  in a minor way, the primary focus always remains the relationship that is  developing among the three main characters. There is a haunting sequence in  which Blake, the healthier and more physically robust of the two, in a fit  of pent-up frustration, actually attempts to pull away from Francis -  emotionally if not quite physically. But Blake realizes that he and his  brother are fated to go through eternity together one way or the other and  that he really would not want it any other way. Indeed, this is as much a  love story about two brothers as it is about two men and a woman.
As the  Siamese twins, the Polish brothers achieve a remarkable triumph on the  level of sheer physicality, somehow convincing us, by their movements and  mannerisms, that they really are two people sharing the same body. More  impressively, they bring a beautifully understated pathos to their  interactions both with each other and the people with whom they come in  contact. Ditto for Michelle Hicks who effectively conveys the compassionate  understanding that brings a rare ray of light to the otherwise dark world  in which the boys live out their secret life.
One could argue that `Twin  Falls Idaho' hedges its bets by portraying a pair of Siamese twins with  which no audience would have any trouble falling in love. And, perhaps,  there is something to be said for that criticism. A more courageous film  might have shown us a slightly more combative, angered or embittered pair,  one which struck out at an unreasoningly prejudiced and cruel world in ways  that might make them less palatable to us and therefore much harder to  like. Perhaps. Yet, as the first film that I can ever remember even having  the nerve to tackle such a risky subject, `Twin Falls Idaho,' in its call  for tolerance and understanding, deserves all the kudos it has rightfully  received.",966902400,33,4009,4.914798206278027
1255987,5,B00002SSKW,"A prostitute is called to a room of a seedy residentialhotel. When she sees that the trick is plural in the form of a pair of conjoined Siamese twins she rather gracefully exists at her first opportunity. However, she comes back, she is drawn back, she has to come back. Thus the stage is set for a beautiful platonic menage-a-trois as side dish to the ongoing menage-a-deux the twins have played since before birth. One of the delights of the film is Halloween, the one day in the year when the twins can openly be comfortable with society as they ""pass"" as simply having a great costume. They go out to eat that night and encounter the prostitute quite by chance. The three go off to a Halloween party where they dance and socialize. The relationship between the three and between the twins continues to be explored. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that the premise focuses on endings and endings must be dealt with. The movie is sad but not depressing. It is uplifting even, but never tries to tap any cheap emotion that lesser movies covering the subject would.
My wife wanted to see this movie. I didn't. I was afraid of it. I shouldn't have been. It is played straight. It is played with taste. It is not visually graphic. It IS emotionally graphic, as the situations cause us to think and it connects with the inner freak in all of us. The acting is superb as are all technical aspects of the movie. If you see yourself as a student of human behavior/emotion you will have a forever blank space in your education if you fail to see this movie.",965433600,9,1563,4.430555555555555
1255988,5,B00002SSKW,"But this DVD! it's a quiet sweet slow movie. It has a huge heart. The commentary is quiet and sweet just like the movie. I watched it again and again. I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. It really hit the spot  with me. Another review gives a play by play of every scene. Cojoined  twins, one falls in love. What do they do when one of them falls in love  with someone? How do you have a relationship with a perma-third-wheel?",964224000,,433,4.2560975609756095
1255989,3,B00002SSKW,"Like another reviewer, I also chose this film off the movie rental rack because of the weird subject. Siamese twins sharing a lover? How perverse.  But the sexuality in this film is blunted to the point of being  nonexistant. The most erotic scene, if you can call it that, is when Penny  paints the toenails of a conjoined foot. The color is ""bruised.""
The Penny character is an emaciated young woman who is shocked by her  first full view of the conjoined twins, so shocked that she runs away, out  of their strange and shoddy hotel. But she returns to pick up her forgotten  bag and to  use their phone. She falls asleep waiting for a return phone  call and wakes to the sound of the twins retching in a filty bathroom. Then  she somehow  magicically  convinces a doctor to come to the hotel to check  them over, and when he leaves,  nurtures the twins with Sprite and potato  chips and prescription medicine drunk straight from the bottle.
 Her  costumes are interesting, although the best part about her skeletal body is  the fringe jiggling on her flat chest. There is a short dialogue where it  is revealed that she had a retarded child once, so that is probably why she  falls into codependence with the twins, whom she always calls, ""both  of you,"" as in ""Do both of you want something to drink""?  The twins, Blake and Francis, whisper to each other in a conspiracy of  intimacy no one before Penny has shattered.  One has a habit of resting his  head on the other's shoulder, which is touching.
This a big-city New York  type of movie, with nary a green plant or a child in sight, and the  Halloween party scene is a great example of this type of atmosphere. The  siamese twins are fragile, pale young men with crewcuts and wearing dingy  70s clothes. They are in town to find their mother, who gave them up for  adoption, and who rejects them now when they ""trick or treat"" at  her door, although she relents and does come to visit them in the  hospital.
There is a lot of talk about ""love"" and  ""loneliness"" in this movie.  The narrative progresses steadily to  an improbable hospital scene where the twins are separated, because one of  them, Francis, is dying of a weak heart. The movie ends on winter circus  grounds, where the remaining twin grieves the loss of his brother, the  implication being that Penny is now to take the place of the lost twin.
This is not an exceptional movie, but it is not bad, either. It IS  definitely haunting, although I wished the dialogue was less superficial.  The ""siamese"" makeup is fantastic and it looks incredibly like  the two young men are really joined together. I was so convinced that I  couldn't trust the final scene where the living twin hobbles about withOUT  his brother.",963792000,,2736,4.545267489711934
1255990,5,B00002SSKW,"I didn't really know what to expect of TWIN FALLS, IDAHO.  Much to my  surprise, it turned out to be a very beautiful film, about conjoined twins:  Blake and Francis.  There's something very dark and melancholic about the  film. The story is quite original, the direction was very good as well.  I  was very taken by the Polish brother's protrayl of the twins.  You can't  help be taken in by them on screen.  One often conjures up images of  siamese twins as freak show acts, but in this film it's hard not to view  them as two distinct people.  Very compelling!  I highly recommend this  film.",961804800,,595,4.481132075471698

7916179,5,B00002SSKW,"Notice the color pallete chosen by the director.  The movie transitions from cool, even cold blues in the first two acts, to pastels and earthy tones in the third.

Some stories are told to you through stictly words, words that seem insufficient at times; while ""Twin Falls Idaho"" comes to you more through emotion and mood.  Nothing is in your face.  The twins here even speak in almost inaudible tones so that you strain to hear what they say.  But you don't need to actually hear those words.  After all, you almost know what they are saying but don't want to intrude, since they are a pair whose private words are to be respected.

I screened this film many years ago, and decided to watch it again after it came available in HD widescreen.  The camera loves the female lead -- Michele Hicks -- who gives a haunting performance here.  She's a little louder than the twins, but not by much.  Every move, while probably choreographed, comes across as natural, as if she's making that move for the first time.  A terrific performance.

This film seems to be about commitment, sacrifice, and maybe even synergy:  the sum is greater than the parts.  But it's more than that perhaps, since the brothers can't imagine living without one another.  There is a dream-like sequence where they are separated, riding bikes together at first, and then separated by a great chasm at the end.  They wave at each other, smile as best as they are able, and then are separated, perhaps forever.

As with many films, the director seems to like David Lynch.  But this is perhaps a Lynchian-inspired direction with true restraint and constraint.  There is a scene between Ms. Hicks and the twins' mother that is as devastating as anything you will see in ""Schindler's List.""  And for me, this would lead to more than a big recommendation.",1359590400,,1820,4.681388012618297
7916180,4,B00002SSKW,"Twin Falls Idaho (1999)  Michael Polish, Mark Polish, Michele Hicks, Jon Gries, Patrick Bauchau

Rated R.

Fate draws together a sensitive street hooker named Penny and a pair of conjoined (Siamese)male twins, Blake and Francis, living at a fleabag hotel, one of whom is very sickly. They share their organs and so much more.
The Polish brothers are twins in real life, along with being actors and directors,  and they do a good job of actually appearing joined.
A very unusual indie, moody with a subtle and surreal melancholy.
Quite original and strangely touching.
Not much happens plot-wise in this film. It's all character driven. No beginning, middle and end in the typical sense.
Atmospheric and very sad in some ways, but therein lies its sweetness as it explores the depths of the human soul.
There is a rare beauty in pain and tragedy that few wish to know about.
There's even a touch of dark humor.
This is a movie for a quiet, rainy night when you're all alone and in the mood for something shadowy and dreamlike...and when you have tears locked inside that need to come out.
This film is gently told and quietly profound.
God bless the outcasts, they need mercy, too.",1357430400,2,1180,4.713592233009709
