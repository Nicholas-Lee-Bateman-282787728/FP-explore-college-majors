Thoroughly entertaining flick about a misfit nurse who swears revenge against a man who caused her father to commit suicide after killing her mother and brother. I found some of the suspense scenes to be rather humorous at times, and the plot holes made the movie even funnier. Good pick for fans of cheap cinema.",1080259200,7,339,4.666666666666667
7871748,3,630445886X,"Another of the producer Pierre David's classy thrillers which features Lisa Zane in a surprisingly effective and chilling role. Zane plays Laura Harriman, a nurse whose father was recently accused of embezzlement. When Laura walks in on her father committing suicide and murdering her mother and brother, she vows revenge on the man who accused her father. After Bob Martin, the man who made the accusation, has a stroke after hearing of Laura's family's tragedy, Laura decides to take on her revenge now and take a job as his live-in nurse. Now, Bob is helpless and paralyzed, at the mercy of his new caretaker: Nurse Harriman. Above-average direct-to-video thriller has some decent scares and moments of suspense, but the plot seems to go almost nowhere in some scenes. The performances are good and I found that the music suited the film beautifully adding an eerie feel to it. Unfortunately, the plot holes and the plot going nowhere lower the rating for this. **The reason why Nurse Laura Harriman decides to vow revenge is quite similar to that of Payton Flanders' reason to vow revenge in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.",1071792000,13,1127,4.9057591623036645
