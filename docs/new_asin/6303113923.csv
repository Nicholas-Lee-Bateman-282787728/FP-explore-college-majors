7840463,5,6303113923,"This Cabin Fever tape features commentary from film historian Leonard Maltin. The picture is clear and crisp thanks to the painstaking restoration of these films.

""The First Seven Years"" is an early talkie and it shows. There are often gaps with silence, but it is still enjoyable. Jackie is in love with Mary Ann, but he doesn't know how to get her. He asks Kennedy the cop who tells him to act like a caveman. This fails miserably, but Mary gives him a second chance. She challenges Jackie and another love-struck boy to a duel just like in her picture book. Terror ensues as the two boys stab everything and everyone in sight.

""Hi'-Neighbor!"" fares a bit better by modern standards. Wally is in love with Jane, but she would rather pal around with the rich kid. After all, he has a fire engine to ride around in. Wally decides the only way to win back his girl is to make his own fire engine, only his will be big enough for the whole gang! When it is completed, Wally challenged the rich kid to a race with mixed results.

""The Pinch Singer"" is a very polished film with the gang's trademark musical segements. The gang hears about a local radio contest that gives $50 for a prize. They begin auditioning members to perform and the acts vary. Buckwheat fakes an amazing whistling routine to the shock of everyone until Porky ruins it. Alfalfa croons, of course but Darla rivals him with her rendition of ""I'm In the Mood For Love."" The gang decides to send Darla on the audition, but something keeps her away and Alfalfa goes on instead. He just doesn't know when to stop!

""Rushin' Ballet"" should look familiar to anyone who saw the recent feature length remake. Butch is after Spanky and Alfalfa, and the only thing they know to escape his wrath is dress up in girls' ballet costumes. Alfalfa's big mouth gives them away, so they run onstage in a flurry of panic and manage to wreck the show. Another highly polished short, this film is delight to watch.",1208649600,,1962,4.51830985915493
