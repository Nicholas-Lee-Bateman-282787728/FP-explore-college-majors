1984273,5,B0001AP16M,"Being a Dale Earnhardt Jr fan, I had to order this on the day released.  It arrived today, and I must say, it is a great watch.  There's a lot of things shown that gets the dedicated Dale Jr. fan right into his world.  With clips of his new house, his race shop, his wins at Talladega and Phoenix, various sponsors appearances, and chilling with his buddies, you get to see just how cool of a guy Dale Jr. really is.  I reccommend this to every single Dale Jr. fan with a DVD player...and if you don't have one, go buy one so you can watch it!",1076457600,3,543,4.046728971962617
1984274,4,B0001AP16M,"This DVD is well thought out and executed. I like the style, it looks kind of low-budget, but I can't imagine it actually is. It is an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the demands on Nextel Cup's hottest young driver, from commercial shoots to shopping mall appearances in front of thousands of screaming fans, everyone wants a piece of Dale Jr. on and off the track. It is refreshing to see how 'normal' he is - he still hasn't completely unpacked into his new house, we follow him to a haircut and he gets bored at photo shoots. Here's hoping he stays grounded as his star continues to rise.",1125014400,4,598,4.546296296296297
1984275,5,B0001AP16M,"Inside, behind the scenes, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is one of the hardest working men in NASCAR today. In Any Given Day he takes you into his world... shows you what the driver of the #8 Budweiser car really does all week! Dale even takes us with him on his leisure time showing us how real and laid back he really is. From being in a photo shoot, to hunting with his friends, to racing the #8 Chevy, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is a man of great spirit, drive, and heart. Once you see this, you will never see him in the same way again, you will respect him more on and off the track as a man not following in his father's footsteps but a man who stands alone!

I applaud Dale in his bravery to do this week in and out. I also commend him on taking time to talk to as many people as he can and also to his contributions to the Make a Wish foundation.

Watch this video if you like NASCAR and DEFINATELY watch it if you love Dale Jr.! Thank you Dale for letting us into your life this way and for all you do on and off the track... but especially for on the track.

(Side note: Alabama loves you Dale. Thanks for making Talladega so Enjoyable!)",1123200000,7,1129,4.053811659192825
1984276,5,B0001AP16M,This DVD gives you an idea of what life is like off the track. I've watched a few time and still enjoy. Great for wintertime  and off weekends when you need that NASCAR fix.,1123027200,3,173,4.088235294117647
1984277,5,B0001AP16M,"After watching this DVD - I can honestly give it the ""Thumbs Up"" for the manner in which Jr. allows us into his ""NASCAR"" life.  He truly does give one a feeling for what it takes to succeed with his career choice.

The direction of this DVD, the method of filming, and Dale's candid talking to the camera let's anyone even remotely interested in stock car racing get insight into this lifestyle.  He comes across as the boy-next-door in a good way....even with all his bleeped cussing!  It's good to know that this young man still tries to maintain a ""normal"" lifestyle.

Purchase this DVD because you're interested in NASCAR. Purchase this DVD because you're a Jr. Fan.  Purchase this DVD to see how a North Carolina Native remains true to his fans and family.  Just purchase it!",1096502400,17,780,4.608695652173913
1984278,5,B0001AP16M,"I really hesitated getting this DVD, being a race fan it seems like only a few drivers are highlighted. But I am glad that I did.  Seeing so much press on Jr. I started to wonder if he was in all these ads because he is full of himself.  He is definitely not.  He has qualities in him you don't see in many ""stars""; character, heart and humility.

The DVD was well done, very real, up close and personal and extremely funny!  The selection of music/lyrics really fit the DVD.  Seeing those that surround him, helped to see how he stays grounded and real.  I was also glad that there was not a section on his past female relationships. He is a great race car driver in his time.  So many say he isn't his father, well, why should he be?  He is Dale Jr., his own man.

I do not envy his schedule and the amount of privacy that is taken away from him but I do see how all his popularity and earnings has helped so many organizations and foundations reach their goals and victories.  By lending his name to Victory Junction or Make A Wish he is able to make many things happen for some souls that definitely need there moment in the spotlight.

I recommended every race fan see his DVD, whether you are a Jr. fan or not.",1093824000,25,1216,4.171673819742489

It really gives you a perspective of what its like to be Dale Earnhardt Jr. and what his life is like in and outside the track.  I would recommend this DVD very much.

1984281,5,B0001AP16M,"I am sooo glad I bought this DVD. Watching a week in Jr's shoes really lets you see what he goes through. Nothing was left out. Any JR. fan's out there that don't have this yet, get it, it is well worth it. Next stop, Tony Stewarts ""SMOKE""",1076803200,3,239,4.0
1984282,5,B0001AP16M,"As soon as I got home I watched this. It is awesome to watch I recommend it to everyone that loves NASCAR. Dale Jr. narrates it and it feels like he is actually talking to you in person. There is extras on it and make sure you try the Dale Jr. trivia. There is some music throughout the DVD, but the only band that I liked was Static-x. But that's ok it was well worth the money. Dale Jr. is the sexiest driver :)",1076544000,3,413,3.9285714285714284
