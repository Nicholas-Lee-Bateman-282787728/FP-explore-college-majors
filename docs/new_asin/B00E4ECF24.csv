5890032,5,B00E4ECF24,This DVD is amazing! Everything you need to know to be successful with breastfeeding is on this DVD! Great for couples to watch together during pregnancy!,1375401600,7,154,4.961538461538462
5890033,5,B00E4ECF24,"This DVD is an essential guide to breastfeeding that every new and expectant couple should own - a comprehensive resource that doesn't have to be read like a book! After watching this we learned SO much in preparation for my third baby. I read handfuls of books on breastfeeding before my first two babies nursed, but this information helped us beyond the others by actually helping me avoid and overcome challenges I had previously encountered. My husband understood how to encourage and help me as well! As natural as breastfeeding is supposed to be, there can still be obstacles that keep us from truly relaxing and enjoying the breastfeeding relationship with our babies. I recommend this groundbreaking DVD to ALL newly expectant couples and clients.

5890034,5,B00E4ECF24,"This was so thorough. Breastfeeding is one of those things that one could think is as simple as just put baby to the breast and they will eat. But that is not always so. Breastfeeding is natural but knowledge is power in helping it go well. This is like a one stop shop for tons of information for making breastfeeding easier, latch info is top notch.",1374969600,8,351,4.333333333333333
5890035,5,B00E4ECF24,"Amazing and thorough information by an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant)that can save you time and money.  Easy to understand and implement the ideas and instructions.  Great for parents who really want to be successful at breastfeeding and keeping baby happy and healthy.  (And if it keeps you from buying just 2 cans of formula, it's already paid for itself!!)  Totally worth the investment and makes a great gift!",1374796800,7,441,5.257142857142857
5890036,5,B00E4ECF24,"This DVD offers extensive coverage on all topics of breastfeeding and is the ultimate resource not only for myself each time that I am going through different stages and struggles in breastfeeding, but also the absolute resource for the mothers and fathers in my childbirth education courses. As a whole it provides a great foundation for breastfeeding, and it is broken down in such a way that it is easily searchable later for breastfeeding moms to watch quick clips on topics they need information on.",1374796800,8,504,4.9411764705882355
5890037,5,B00E4ECF24,Having so much valuable information on DVD is priceless! Mom can learn all there is to know about breastfeeding curled up with a snack on the couch or in bed and can refer back to favorite parts easily with the push of a button. There are so many misconceptions about breastfeeding and I am very glad to see that there are affordable and easily attainable resources like this one to facilitate a rise in breastfeeding in our society.,1374710400,5,433,4.564102564102564
5890038,5,B00E4ECF24,"Wonderful breastfeeding video, perfect for a first time mom (or any mom who plans on breastfeeding).  I plan on giving it as a gift at baby showers!  All women deserve this invaluable information and the info from a real expert on the subject.",1374624000,3,243,4.627906976744186
8600936,2,B00E4ECF24,"Buy this if you have plenty of time and don't care if the message is on point.

Don't buy this if you don't like people rambling with many ""umms"" and pauses.... And seemingly often going down a rabbit hold on random topics before rejoining the intended message. The testimonials are unqueued and often long with no obvious purpose or relevance to the ""message"" of the designated chapter.

You're better off going to YouTube than wasting your time and money.

Could've been good if some effort was put in to properly edit.",1530748800,,521,4.7032967032967035
8600937,5,B00E4ECF24,I have purchased this DVD multiple times for expecting moms. They always love it and find it very useful.,1474329600,,105,4.578947368421052
8600938,5,B00E4ECF24,Seriously the best dvd on breastfeeding I have seen (and I've seen quite a few). This is an excellent resource for any nursing mom and the people supporting her.,1412035200,,161,4.586206896551724
8600939,5,B00E4ECF24,"This DVD is a must see for any nursing mom.  As an experienced breastfeeder I was blown away by how much I learned from this video. If you are expecting, this video will give you all the tools you need to be sucessful.",1394150400,,218,4.069767441860465
8600940,5,B00E4ECF24,Great DVD loaded with tons of info for the breastfeeding mom. I attended a live class from the lactation consultant who is in this DVD and learned so much from her. I was very excited to have her DVD to refer back to as needed. It is packed with wonderful information to help all mothers successfully breastfeed their baby and know where to go if they need help and encouragement. I love how Mellanie includes dad explaining his role and exactly how he can be involved supporting mom.,1394150400,,484,4.511363636363637
8600941,5,B00E4ECF24,"When pregnant, I read about three books on breastfeeding and thought that I was good to go. If it wasn't for the help of this fabulous IBCLC, I would have had no idea how much I still had yet to learn. It helped me feel normal the the first week is hard(tender) and that it would get easier... I was pumping okay, but her tips helped increase my output. :-) I always had questions about alcohol, and they are covered. This is a must for mommies everywhere! Someone suggested it as a baby shower gift already, and I think that is pure genius (pair it with some reusable nursing pads and some lanolin, and momma will love you for it, later of course)!",1394150400,,649,4.284552845528455
8600942,5,B00E4ECF24,"This DVD is a great resource for breastfeeding moms.  It covers everything you could ever need to know about breastfeeding in an easy to understand way.  It is great for mom to take a breastfeeding class while she's pregnant so she can ask questions and talk about any concerns she may have but it's hard to remember everything that was covered in the class.  In the thick of postpartum fog and needing to feed this tiny little person, having a reference that can just be popped into the DVD player and have answers right then is great!  There are also stories from other breastfeeding moms so you know you aren't alone in this journey that is so rewarding but can also be difficult at times.  I love this DVD!",1394064000,,710,4.4728682170542635
8600943,5,B00E4ECF24,"I  watched this after I had successfully breastfed three babies well into their 2nd year of life. I thought I had all the information there was to have after reading several popular breastfeeding books and having 5 years of personal breastfeeding experience. Boy was I wrong! I learned new information and was captivated by all the knowledge put into this DVD. If you want to breastfeed, or know someone who does, this is the best information I have found on breastfeeding to date. It is my #1 go-to baby shower gift now.",1379808000,2,521,4.663043478260869
8600944,5,B00E4ECF24,"I had already breastfed two babies and was pregnant with my third when I watched The Ultimate MRE. I had struggled with low supply, never making it more than a few months before needing to supplement. I read the popular breastfeeding books and frequented online breastfeeding forums, but nothing I tried helped. I really didn't expect to learn anything new from this DVD but I did! I also felt much better about my breastfeeding journey. My third baby is now 5 months old and he has never had a drop of formula, I am sure Mellanie's tips have helped me establish the breastfeeding relationship I struggled to achieve before.",1375488000,6,624,4.73394495412844
8600945,5,B00E4ECF24,Mellanie's knowledge is so vast. Thankful that she decided to make a DVD and share some with us! A must have for any parent who is planning to breastfeed!,1375401600,8,154,4.344827586206897
