8644993,4,B00ISDWVC6,LIKE THE GREAT DIVIDE THIS OLD MOVIE HAS A DECENT PRINT AND HAS THE BONUS OF FEATURING AN EARLY JOHNNY MAC BROWN. VERY INTERESTING FOR WESTERN MOVIE ADDICTS.,1486425600,,157,4.642857142857143
8644994,5,B00ISDWVC6,"A nice example of an early ""talkie"" picture.  I agree with other reviewers that the pacing is choppy and rushed at times. Crawford is fresh and lovely. A true Crawford fan like me will enjoy this picture. I think it's well worth the watching. It's a great picture.",1477526400,,264,4.5
8644995,5,B00ISDWVC6,"Loved this movie! Joan Crawford is young, adorable, displaying a wide range of vocal and acting skills, falling in love with Western cowboy Johnny Mack Brown, a strong man who can't be pushed around by anyone, even Crawford.  The songs are hauntingly beautiful, worth the cost of owning this film.  The dialogue fast, spunky, unexpectedly witty for ole Montana!  I think the fact this was filmed on location in summertime Montana contributes to the casts' and our enjoyment.  If you want to feel and see what people were like a century ago in America, calm your modern need for quick cut edits, and enjoy!",1472342400,2,605,4.788461538461538
8644996,5,B00ISDWVC6,Montana Moon was released in 1930. It starred Joan Crawford. She plays the ranch owners daughter who falls in love with a cowboy. Pretty good early Joan Crawford film. Shows some of what her fans grew to expect in later films. Fans of Joan Crawford will like this the most.,1468368000,,273,4.48
8644997,5,B00ISDWVC6,"A funky typical western, and an early Johnny Mack Brown and Joan Crawford movie.",1447632000,,80,4.785714285714286
8644998,3,B00ISDWVC6,"Montana Moon (1930) stars Joan Crawford, John Mack Brown, Dorothy Sebastian, Benny Rubin, and Cliff Edwards.  Basically the movie is about a New York party girl (Crawford) who is heading to Montana on a train to be with her family.  Along the way, she meets a cowboy and the two of them.........I don't want to give anything away, you'll have to watch it for yourself.  This movie is an early pre-Code talkie from early 1930.  Some of the movie was shot on location in Montana.  The acting is fair throughout.  Crawford's acting is so-so, not bad.  Her acting is WAY better in another movie that came out later that same year, Paid (1930).  Montana Moon's pacing is rather poor, but the pacing in most early talkies is poor due to the transition from silents to talkies.  Early talkies have the same pacing that silent films have.  Crawford sings in this movie and sings very well, in my opinion.  In my opinion, what brings this movie down a notch or two is the poor pacing, so-so acting, sub par script, comedy relief that falls flat, and singing cowboys.  The movie does have its moments here and there, though.  It is pretty well shot as well, though some of the editing is not so good.

Overall, this is a movie that is worth a look, but there are a lot better movies from the 1930s that Crawford starred in.",1428105600,3,1313,4.485232067510548
