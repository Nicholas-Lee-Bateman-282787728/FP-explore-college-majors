8423621,5,B004CSWW70,"The usual black and white WW11 footage is very valuable, but there is nothing like color film.  This is what the soldiers, airmen, and sailors, saw and experienced, during their wartime service.  In my view these color films are far more valuable , they depict what actually happened in its true form.  I'm not talking about just the guns firing, or the tanks and ships engaged in battle.  I'm talking about the men themselves.  The brutality and the emotional wreckage caused by war can seen on their faces.  In my opinion the death and destruction take on added meaning when seen in color.  These films should be preserved for future generations, they are a very valuable part of our history and world history.  JRV",1376956800,,717,4.725806451612903
