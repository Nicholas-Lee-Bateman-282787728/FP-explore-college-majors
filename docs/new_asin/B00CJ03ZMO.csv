8582269,4,B00CJ03ZMO,Lionsgate needs to treat its power ranger franchise better. Shout factory should of gotten the entire license. Power rangers samurai never got a blu-ray release. It was mistreated due to poor marketing decisions. That's the only reason I give it four stars. Lions gate needs to step up its game and release a proper blu-ray release with special features. Just have a look at how shout factory released the first 17 years.,1421625600,,421,4.861111111111111
