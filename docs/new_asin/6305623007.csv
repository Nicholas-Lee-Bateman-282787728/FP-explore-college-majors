7893024,5,6305623007,"In case you are wondering why I ordered this when I have the complete season on DVD, it was because I needed it so I could make a music video for the Magna Defender with the image song for his Japanese counterpart, as well one for the Lost Galaxy Rangers with the theme song for the Japanese version of the show.  All I need to say is that this is one of the most memorable arcs of the season.  It is surprisingly dark at points for something aimed at children (which I almost always encourage, as it often makes the series more memorable).  The last episode actually had me crying.  If you don't have a DVD player, this will do until you find one.",1402272000,,648,4.201612903225806
7893025,4,6305623007,Good show still even after 10 plus years and the movie showed up faster then estimated time of arrival! The show is a little cheesy but still fun!,1362528000,,146,4.25

7893027,5,6305623007,The VHS tape worked perfectly and is one my kids love. Excellent purchase!,1173571200,,74,4.769230769230769
7893028,4,6305623007,"For a show intended for kids, this was really quite good. If you can suspend your disbelief and refrain from being too critical, this tape has some really neat effects, cool acrobatic martial arts sequences, and some interesting looking characters and weapons.  You get a full 90 minutes on this tape, so depending on whether you enjoy the Power Rangers or not, that can be either good or bad.  But if you've got a kid in the family or you're just a kid at heart and into light-fare sci-fi martial arts action, this tape is a pretty great buy.",976060800,6,543,4.474747474747475
7893029,1,6305623007,"Damn it! I just came from dissing the new Lightspeed Rescue jobholders and now I have to do the same thing to THESE clowns? The Magna Defender was the  only reason to watch Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, which in my opinion was  very different from the previous follow-ups. Believe it or not, where the  first three reincarnations had teens not yet graduated from college  (remember ""Angel Grove""?), this one and the seriously  reincarnated Lightspeed Rescue puts these former superstars in a whole new  role. Here, they work for their masters, and most recently, they even have  jobs, but who cares? Can you imagine the ridiculous craze that stormed the  world years ago? Make it stop once and for all!",969235200,,699,4.815126050420168

This movie is really cool. It has cool special  effects, cool action, cool heros, and more! You should watch this power  movie, it just might take you into a lost galaxy.",950659200,,343,4.34375
