8138934,2,B000HDR88C,"I bought these DVD's to watch as I was recovering from surgery. I enjoy the Frasier shows very much. I rated this product low because these DVDs don't have an option to ""Play all episodes."" You can only play one episode, and when that episode is over, you have to hit Play again to run the next episode, and so forth. If I had known this, then I wouldn't have bought these.",1308355200,3,373,4.194444444444445
8138935,5,B000HDR88C,I loved Frasier in Cheers. An Never got to watch the Frasier episodes when they were on the air. So glad I purchased them now. Since there is really nothing on tv anyway. I just look at this over and over again. This is a classic for me.,1254528000,3,237,3.9583333333333335
8138936,5,B000HDR88C,"I love this series. Thank god Chelse Grammar got a hair cut later in the series. Frasier is the pinicle of good sitcoms. It was a pitty that all good things should come to an end. Please, never ruin this series with a 'Brady Bunch Christmas Special' type show in ten years.",1182470400,3,273,4.269230769230769
