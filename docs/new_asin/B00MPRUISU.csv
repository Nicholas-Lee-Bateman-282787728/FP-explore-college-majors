6599338,5,B00MPRUISU,"Bravo!!
A great DVD with very very high quality.
A wonderful guide for those players who want to open their ears widely. Not only to get some ideas playing chord on guitar, but approaches to understand harmony and voicing deeply.
Lage really puts his focus on creating voicing movement, and he did it. He is the best.
Thank you Lage. Thank you JazzHeaven.",1414108800,3,355,4.650793650793651
6599339,5,B00MPRUISU,"This DVD is absolutely astounding. 5 stars is not enough. The approach he takes here gives you information that you will not find anywhere else that I know of, and I have an extensive library of jazz guitar instructional materials. If you have ever listened to his music clips, I'm sure you wonder how he gets those interesting and unique voices. Well, it is NOT the old way of memorizing thousands of ""grips"" out of a chord dictionary; throw all that crap away. He takes very ordinary voicings, ones you already knows, and experiments with switching voices, i.e., the 3rd and 9th of a major 9th chord switch places, then you go through the inversions of a major 9th chord. You do the same thing with minor and dominant chords, and once you grasp the concept, you are making your own unique harmonies without worrying about traditional rules of building chords in 3rds.
Like the Hekselman video, I stopped after 47 minutes (1st TWO chapters!!!! 47 minutes!!!!!) and just let my tiny mind try of absorb this much information. I have not finished looking at the instructional part (over 2 1/2 hours long!!) because there is so much, it seemed a bit overwhelming to me. What I got from the first 2 chapters alone was worth the price of the DVD. Already, just in one 4-hour session with this DVD, I have come up with a lot of ideas that I have heard musicians like Lund play but did not understand. Before I go any further, I want to make sure I get this part at least somewhat under my fingers, so this is not yet a review of the complete DVD.
I can say, however, that the rest is most certainly a continuation of the high, high quality of the first part. The audio and video, like the Hekselman one, are tremendous. Very clear, split-screen at many points, well organized, well directed; there is even a performance between the sections by his working trio of his tunes that display the previous concept!!!! Brilliant idea. Lund is articulate, careful in his speaking (English not being his native language) but explains what he is doing very well. This is nothing like so many of the Joe Pass videos (""I don't know what that is, I just play this"") or the Pat Martino ones (""mystical theories forever!!""), though I DO love both those guys, this DVD is much, much more accessible. This is NOT for beginners or those who don't have at least a rudimentary grasp of theory, but if you do, and you like the modern, ""non-grip"" sounds of today's jazz guitar, this is a great buy in tandem with the Gilad Hekselman one.",1412899200,5,2509,4.540838852097131
6599340,5,B00MPRUISU,"Lage Lund is one of the most celebrated jazz guitarists on the New York scene today. As a side man he has played with the likes of Maria Schneider, Wynton Marsalis, Mulgrew Miller, FLY and more. And it is the function of a sideman that sets the focus of his video ""Jazz guitar chordal vocabulary"".

As the great teacher Lage Lund obviously is, he starts out the video making clear what the video will NOT cover. No quartal harmony, drop two voicings or open string voicings. The main reason for this is obvious. It has been done in videos and literature thoroughly for decades. After that, Lage reveals his plan for expanding your chordal knowledge.

So what has this video to offer?

After watching it several times it all boils down to some basic principles. One is that you should start from something familiar that you already know, and the other is making it as simple as possible. In many cases Lage starts from common chords, like C-major9, a C-minor9, or a G major triad over C. When he later shows how to modify these chords in a systematic way and applying inversions the result is fantastic.

You will be struck of how fresh and new the chords/voicings sound, yet still the sound is familiar and easy to understand from a theoretical view point. Sometimes the chords are hard to grab though if you are unfamiliar with stretches.

Lage never let the music out of sight and all examples are applied within a musical context, like II-V-I progressions or parts of standard tunes. Worlds within those musical context unfolds exponentially. He also shows all possible functions of one chord over twelve different bass notes, how to create movement and harmonic motion and open triads, etc.

The main reasons to buy this video are that you will not only learn new ways to expand your chordal vocabulary, but you will also realize the width of your own knowledge. And that is very uplifting. Because when he shows a systematic way to treat ONE chord, you obviously can apply that method to every chord you know.
You just have to work hard on it, and you will be inspired to do that, because throughout the video Lage plays his original music with a trio setting and some solo guitar playing, and his playing is a breathtaking result of his own method. This is probably the best video for guitar (in any category) I've ever watched.

The structure of the video is so well thought out and Lage sticks to the plan. I wouldn't be surprised if this video in the future will mentioned in the same breath as late Ted Greene's books and videos.

Production-wise everything looks really good and Lage's characteristic acoustic, almost snappy sound is very well captured. Perhaps the best sound I've heard with Lage.

There are a great number of videos on youtube with jazz guitar lessons (the great Dixon Nacey comes to mind) but you can't expect youtube videos to reach the high production level or knowledge found in this video, or aesthetic insights for that matter. Lage Lund is a leading voice in the jazz scene for a reason. He is the real deal. And this video definitely does him justice in terms of the overall production.

If I had the opportunity to take a lesson from Lage or have this video, I would buy this video, work with it for a couple of years, and then take a lesson. Get this video. Your brain and soul will thank you.",1411516800,11,3333,4.595959595959596
6599341,5,B00MPRUISU,"This is one of the best things I've done for my guitar playing in years.  Lage Lund is one of best of the new breed of Jazz guitarists and big fan of his albums.  This video focuses on chords ideas to expand your chord vocabulary and great lessons in how to get more out of what you already know.  There is three hours of instruction on this DVD so amazing value for all the information Lage shares.  Plus Lage has a real quirky sense of humour to add to the enjoyment.  If you into Jazz guitar and love chords like I do, you'll dig this DVD.",1411171200,8,542,4.0754716981132075
6599342,5,B00MPRUISU,"Jazz Heaven Lage Lund's dvd is amazing. I can't stop watching it and gettin' useful information from it. Lage's playing is amazing and here you can check how great it is just listening to his guitar as if you were there taking the lesson. It's communicative, clear, clever and funny and his playing is killing. Definitely the best purchase I've done in years. Five stars is not enough.",1426723200,2,385,4.676470588235294
6599343,5,B00MPRUISU,Lage covers so many amazing techniques in this video. Lots of food for thought and ideas to explore!,1425859200,,100,4.611111111111111
6599344,4,B00MPRUISU,"Lots of modern thinking here, well worth the money. One huge problem; there are errors all over the place in the booklet; even Lund, when working through All The Things You Are refers to the Bbm chord as Bm often. If you're not able to question what's going on the video, or correct the errors, the video will set you back a long way.",1424908800,,334,4.234375
6599345,5,B00MPRUISU,"If you just want to learn a couple of new chord voicing this video might NOT be for you.  But if you are a student of jazz and you feel stuck in terms of harmony and voicing - or you want to make sure you have a good direction to work toward in expanding your chordal vocabulary - this video is worth it's weight in gold.

I'm an alum of the Jazz Program at William Paterson, so I've had some really good instruction in the past...but the information and methodology here is, I think, more valuable than any other single class I can remember.  There is about year's worth of material to digest, and a lifetime's worth of material to explore and master.  I wish I had this years ago!",1423699200,6,682,4.223076923076923
6599346,5,B00MPRUISU,Its has a lot of useful information related to understanding his approach to harmony. He perceives harmony from a very organic perspective that focuses on voice leading every pitch. This Dvd is a must have for anyone looking years of material to work on to make you a better musician!,1422662400,,284,4.7
6599347,5,B00MPRUISU,Simply Great!!,1420416000,,14,6.5
6599348,5,B00MPRUISU,"Absolutley fantastic, there is months , if not years of material to work on here, I've watched it for fun, without the guitar in my hands, now have gone back, and the first chapter alone, what a lesson in changing up your chord vocal by thinking about things differently!
Lage comes across really cool, great teacher and amazing performances. Very inspiring and can't recommend this enough for any guitarist wishing to expand...",1417305600,2,428,4.958333333333333
6599349,5,B00MPRUISU,"Lage is definitely communicating in clearly thought out chapters what he's been asked in many masterclasses. the extra length of the dvd is also meaning they retrying to give the most, I really appreciate it.",1416441600,2,208,4.9714285714285715
6599350,5,B00MPRUISU,"Lage's lesson here covers how you get the best mileage out of any chord shape you now know and ways to come up with interesting inversions and new usages. It also covers the voice leading and how you get the harmonic motion in various situation. Lage only shows few examples due to the limitation of the movie duration, but knowing how you could utilize it to all the possible harmonic shapes you can think of, it's literally a life time process to absorb the potential of this DVD. The concept is really easy to comprehend, but wether or not you can use it and develop yourself would require your life long devotion. I'm getting myself busy working on it and highly recommend!",1415750400,2,677,4.557377049180328
8673848,4,B00MPRUISU,The video is worth seeing ...however my feeling are that I don't like how Lund presents the info...he seems to stammer and repeat himself a lot ...But as I said there's a lot to gain from this video.,1524614400,,199,4.2631578947368425
8673849,5,B00MPRUISU,"Great instructional with a lot to digest, very well documented too.",1467763200,,67,5.181818181818182
8673850,5,B00MPRUISU,Excellent instructional value. Any guitarist would benefit,1447459200,,58,7.428571428571429
8673851,4,B00MPRUISU,"Buckle up for a real lesson and guitar ride.  I will agree with many of the other reviews - this is a great alternative to standard grips/chords, ""typical"" sounding chords (stacked in thirds) and common sounds (diatontic, scalar approaches) that many of us get stuck in.  And the lessons are very well done and move in a logical pattern.  I will confess, after a first listen, I ""get it"" - that is, I get what he's trying to impart and it is fresh, hip and very unique sounding.  It's amazing how some simple inversions can create such great sounds.  BUT........there's a lot of work on part of the learner and the application of these ideas will likely take a good deal of time and effort to incorporate fluidly into one's playing.  I would say that that stretches to make the chords are often very difficult and the listener is encouraged to look for short cuts or alternate fingerings.  Honestly, as an intermediate level guitar player, I found some of this a bit daunting and will have to go through this DVD a few more times and work out some of the easier stuff slowly and see how to add it to my existing playing.  I'm excited by the opportunities but a bit put off by the amount of work it will likely take.",1438646400,,1215,4.417040358744394
8673852,5,B00MPRUISU,"So it was around christmas and i thought that i would take a break from the guitar and celebrate the holidays. I got this Dvd around christmas and guess what happened? I spent the whole week with this dvd. I started watching the Dvd and within 5 minutes i was hooked. I can't remember the last time i felt so inspired.

There are so many different sections on this dvd about chords and they are all equally interesting. He show and explains all of the stuff very thoroughly and systematic. It's all very easy to understand and Mr lage feels like a really good teacher. With that said though this Dvd is not for beginners. Some of the theory behind the things he talks about can probably be a bit overwhelming if you're not used to that kind of stuff, and some of the chords take a little time getting used to both in the hands and ears.

So as you may have figured there's a staggering amount of information on this dvd which also means that its VERY LONG (which is VERY GOOD). Its 3 hours and its equally interesting from beginning to end. It's impossible for me to write about all of the the things he covers in this dvd but let me just say that there's a lot of very very nice things here to work on, and each section will keep you occupied for a looong time.

This is insanely good stuff! The things Lage talks about will keep you going for YEARS. Really, really inspiring stuff! Audio/video production is perfect and the guys at jazzheaven is also really helpful and very nice.

If i could rate this dvd lesson a thousand stars i would.",1437696000,2,1541,4.321799307958478
8673853,4,B00MPRUISU,"As an avid listener of Lund's work and as a player too, I really looked forward to this DVD.  And its really good.  Without giving away too much, Lund takes a couple of very familiar voicings of very familiar chords and shows you how to make them both less familiar and more broadly applicable.  It took me weeks to get through the whole thing the first time, stopping it every few minutes to play through,etc.  Jazz Heaven has been doing some really neat DVDs lately - having someone relatively new with a fresh sound like Lage's do a DVD like this is great.

Its not for the beginner - its not finger busting but only someone who has been playing a while would see how to make it work on lots of other tunes and progressions.  No real reservations, apart from a couple of typos in the PDF.",1431302400,,791,4.3108108108108105
8673854,5,B00MPRUISU,Great stuff!,1430870400,,12,5.5
8673855,5,B00MPRUISU,"This is an excellent prodduct, much superior to anything else I've come acroos on the topic (jazz guitar chords). Lage gives a lot of info very well put out and the extras are great too (interview, gear, trio playing, pdfs mp3, etc...) Highly recommended!!",1430870400,,256,4.840909090909091
8673856,5,B00MPRUISU,"Terrific! Lage exposes his concepts in a clear and concise way, allowing the musician to use them at once in his/her own playing, though not with Lage's incredible Time and dexterity. What's really great is that he shows you how to turn some harmonic concepts into those mindblowing lines he plays. By far, the best lesson I've ever had.",1430092800,,337,4.728813559322034
8673857,5,B00MPRUISU,"A must have, but only if you know the fingerboard intervals and locations when choosing a chord in it's various positions.
Simply put, his teaching process begins on a chord with the root note (1) on the lowest string, and then from there the intervals get switched and transferred to various locations. Some great sounding results. This will be one I'll continue working with for advanced chord development. Very understandable with his slow and direct explanations and fine quality recording. A must have for sure.
With that said, a chord is an expression of the sound that you like, and can be applied however you like. It simply doesn't have to be Jazz. Go with that, and give it a try. Small price to pay for great chord discoveries on your own that you will remember because you see the interval, instead of buying a chord book with dots on a grid.",1427673600,,854,4.625
