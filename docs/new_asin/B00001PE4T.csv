Since then I have been following the principles John Basedow believes in and today I am in the best shape of my life! This is not some ""fad"" diet or a quick fix. Instead it is an easy to follow, practical approach to diet and excersise that will help you put into action a heathly lifestyle of your own. This program will definitly help you get into the best shape of your life too......and stay that way.",1041638400,2,472,4.314606741573034

1245990,5,B00001PE4T,"As a Certified Fitness Trainer, I only trust my clients with one other Fitness Authority...John Basedow.  His knowledge is an asset to the industry and his tapes are a MUST for anyone looking to improve their fitness.",1039132800,4,217,4.864864864864865
1245991,5,B00001PE4T,"Fitness Made Simple is the most effective exercise program I have found to date. John Basedow's no nonsense, no gimmick approach to finess makes it easy to get and stay in shape.",1038268800,2,178,4.59375
1245992,1,B00001PE4T,"In the advertisements this seemed like a video with a real detailed workout and nutrition plan because it claims to be for people of any fitness level, but it falls short in both areas.  The video quality is terrible, but that aside anyone with a basic knowledge of fitness will find this a complete waste of time.  Even beginners will be lost because not enough detail is included for the beginner.  Also, without a gym membership this video does not work.  All in all your money would be better spent somewhere else.",1000771200,53,518,4.5978260869565215
7914635,1,B00001PE4T,"I was checking into the availability of some used DVD's of Fitness Made Simple and was glad I read the reviews.  There seems to be no middle ground here.  I checked all the 5 star reviews as someone earlier wrote in his review and did indeed notice that this was their one and only review.  I did not see any so-so reviews - all were either gushing about the video or they were outright displeased with it.  So, thanks for saving me the money.  After reviewing all the reviews and reading between the lines, I'll pass on these videos and continue on with my gym membership.",1146096000,3,573,4.367924528301887
7914636,5,B00001PE4T,"In this video, John thoughtfully lays down the foundation for better health and fitness with exercise techniques that almost anyone can do.  Not only that, they can all be done in the comfort and privacy of one's own home with john's expertise and knowledge guiding you every step of the way!",1143244800,,292,4.7254901960784315
7914637,4,B00001PE4T,"I can't say that this video is the best ever as I have very little experience with fitness videos; however, I did find Basedow's essential techniques and the information he provides to be helpful. It should be noted that the title is misleading. The exercises themselves are simple enough, but the strategies to achieving fitness aren't.

The meal plan was an excellent example and indication of what a focused diet should look like, but his recipes weren't anyhting that I would particularly enjoy eating--BUT THE PRINCIPLES REMAIN RELEVANT! The nutrition portion is perhaps the most important aspect of the video because it provides all the information needed to make sound food choices. Furthermore, it will help you in figuring out why you haven't seen the results you may have expected.

As far as the excercises are concerned, I began to notice subtle physique changes within the first month. It's now week 7 and friends are beginning to notice. The workouts typically take about an hour and require a few weights, dumbells, a bar, and a bench with a leg extension attachment. There are some machines used on the video, but I've omitted the pec-deck exercises and do all my pull-ups on a ledge outside of my home.

It's important to realize that the exercises themselves aren't important, but the plan of assault toward getting fit is; so the video spends a lot of time on Basedow's plan and he constantly encourages you to devise your own. He also points out some basic techniques to bear in mind when you lift.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with the video and my lifestyle has changed significantly since taking its messages to heart. The production value of the video isn't appealing at all and Basedow isn't the best spokesman for anything, but the simplicity of the video keeps me from getting distracted and keeps me on task. If you do chose to purchase this video, keep in mind that it's a muscle building program. In order to see any of the muscles you've worked so hard to build, you need to supplement your weight training with cardio and a good cardio video would be useful to keep you motivated and on point. By the way, videos don't cause results, hard work does.",1121644800,4,2184,4.739473684210527
7914638,1,B00001PE4T,"i was looking into this video today...  so when i got on amazon, and read the reviews (above) i noticed that 1 was VERY POOR, and gave and explaination as to why it was poor...  all the others sounded more like a sales pitch....

So...  if you look at all the 5 star ratings...  click the ""view all my ratings"" link next to their rating...  and you will notice that all of them have ONLY COMMENTED ON THE FITNESS MADE SIMPLE VIDEOS...

This would tell you that these are fake comments,  put in by advertisers....

John speaks to you in a very personal way and explains the proper technique as you go along set by set and rep by rep.

You cannot go wrong buying this video or any video by John Basedow, I know first hand they work....!!",1110672000,,670,4.368
7914640,5,B00001PE4T,"Fitness Made Simple has it all, an outstanding exercise program that strengthens and reshapes your body, and simple, sensible nutrition advise that really works. Within 3 months after I started following this program I went from a size 10 to a size 4.  I have lost a total of 22 pounds and kept it off for a year following the advice presented by John Basedow in Fitness Made Simple.  My husband has lost 40 pounds following the Fitness Made Simple program and gone from a size 40 to a size 34. We have more energy and strength than we have had in years and are no longer embarrassed to wear our bathing suits on the beach. We are never hungry and feel great. In addition to the Fitness Made Simple Exercise and Nutrition Plan video we also have the Six Pack Abs, AM/PM Workouts, 45 Minute Fat Burning Workout, and Better Body Basics videos.  We highly recommend all of these tapes as they present additional aspects of the exercise and nutrition program.  John Basedow is an outstanding instructor and shows you how to do the exercises correctly for the maximum desired results. He has also researched nutrition and shares extremely helpful tips that helped me and my husband to lose weight and keep it off without feeling deprived or hungry.  John Basedow is a highly motivational teacher and having these tapes is like having your own personal fitness instructor in your home.  If you are serious about improving your physique and/or losing weight these tapes are a must.",1109376000,,1474,4.6937984496124034
7914641,5,B00001PE4T,"I think this is the best video on the market for anyone looking to either get started or improve their basic workout.  For me it helped me know what to do in the gym to maximize my routine, and helped me to reduce the time I was spending there doing useless exercises.  My time in the gym is less and my results are better than I had hoped for in a very short period of time.  In addition the nutrition segment is so helpful, I could not have reached my goals without putting John's nutritional advice together with the workouts.  Its so basic but put together the way it is on this video it just makes so much sense.",1107388800,,617,4.159663865546219
7914642,5,B00001PE4T,"First of all let me start by saying that people that review this tapes and say ""It falls short"" or ""anyone with a little knowledge knows that"", then why did you order it? I used to be a dedicated athlete and unfortunately had a back injury, later a surgery that prevent me from doing much exercise. after 1 year of the surgery I gained 44 Lbs. I ordered the complete set of videos and I dedicated myself to following the advice and routines. in 4 weeks I have lost 23.5 Lbs and gone from a 45"" waist to a 41.5"" waist. I guess if you sit on your couch eating potato chips with pig lard dip watching the tapes, they won't work. Awesome product, will continue for years to come.",1106438400,,675,4.2
7914643,3,B00001PE4T,"John Basedows commercials caught my attention, so I ordered the DVD 6 Pack Abs.  Unfortunately, It took three DVDs and two months to finally get a DVD that didn't skip.  Now I have the DVD that functions properly and I do think the abdominal workouts are good.  One thing about this video:  I believe the video was made in one take and there was little or no editing done.  On almost every exercise, he messes his count up by at least ten reps, and I can hear the camera men moving around in the background.  Sometimes his microphone even rubs up against his shirt and his voice is barely audible.  I believe too much attention is given to us staring at his own abs, and I find myself having to fast forward through it to save five minutes.",1057622400,22,740,4.318840579710145
