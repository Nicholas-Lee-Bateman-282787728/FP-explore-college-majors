8454250,5,B0052SO0T2,"""Red White and Zero a.k.a. The White Bus"" - MGM Limited Edition Collection DVD-R
""The White Bus"" is an engaging, and charming short film directed by Lindsay Anderson just prior to ""if...."".
The story centers around 'The Girl', played by the lovely Patricia Healey; a bored, detached London office worker. She takes a train to Manchester, then boards a white double decker bus for a day trip of the city and it's environs. She's accompanied by an eclectic assortment of passengers who tour mundane attractions, but each in a most bizarre and surreal manner. Very reminiscent of The Beatles later ""Magical Mystery Tour"" film, which share similar parallels. A minor masterpiece with subtle surprises, and holds up very well over repeated viewings.
A thoroughly enjoyable treat.",1503878400,,774,5.150793650793651
8454251,5,B0052SO0T2,"A million miles from the England of Monty Pythons Flying Circus, To The Manor Born, Fawlty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances, Downton Abbey, Doc Martin... we have a film of a totally different mood filmed at totally different locales called The White Bus.

Ive just had the considerable good fortune to see a fascinating little film called The White Bus.  When it first started I thought I was going to have to compare it to The Forbidden Zone, it was that bizarre, but then it began to make some sort of psychological sense.

The entire movie (yes you could call it a movie) is only 42 minutes long.  Thats all it needs to be, although it is so intriguing and interesting that it could have been a bit longer without overstaying its welcome.

One of the oddest ingredients in the study of a young womans mind is that every once in a while, seemingly completely at random, this monochrome (black & white) film is in full color, usually for one to five seconds.  I gave considerable thought to the seeming randomness of When this happens and finally concluded that it is in color when it Needs to be.

If you are not into art films, but like to see places in Europe (especially in the 60s) then you will very much enjoy The White Bus.  For most of it is almost literally a local government sponsored tour of the industrial and cultural centers of Manchester, England.

I say almost because it may (or may not) occur entirely in the mind of the young woman at the center of the film.  I am no expert in psychology or art films, so I will leave that interpretation to others wiser than I.

Although Im sure it was not meant to be just another uplifting film; ultimately, in following this desperately sad young woman through these fascinating places described by the most cordial tour guides you may ever find, we come out of the movie feeling very refreshed and uplifted.

This is a thoroughly one of a kind experience that I do highly recommend.",1428710400,,1941,4.514285714285714
8454252,5,B0052SO0T2,"While watching this movie on the MGM channel, it made me wonder if this is where Sir Paul McCartney of The Beatles got the idea to make the movie ""Magical Mystery Tour""",1413244800,2,168,4.28125
8454253,4,B0052SO0T2,"Interesting 47 minute short from a Shelagh Delaney short story, directed by the always interesting Lindsay Anderson.  A girl quits her dull job, and goes on a surrealistic bus tour of a dilapidated Manchester, UK. Along for the ride are a strange mix, including a lascivious vicar, lord mayor (Arthur Lowe, always great), etc.

Many of the techniques that became part of Anderson's great films If and O Lucky Man first show up here.(e.g. mixing color and B+W). It also follows O Lucky Man in being a surreal journey of a somewhat passive, young lead character traveling through a world where they have little power. Enigmatic, sure, but its interesting and entertaining in a Brechtian/Anderson sort of dark humored politically satirical way. Clearly its making fun of the pathetic nature of modern society and our desperate need to justify all the glories of progress that really sap our humanity. There are some truly terrific and haunting images.

Not up to the best of where Anderson would go as a film maker, but a must for anyone interested in his development, and certainly interesting for any fan of challenging, unusual films.

Note; a young Anthony Hopkins shows up very briefly singing German!",1344038400,2,1203,4.970149253731344
8454254,5,B0052SO0T2,"Despite being titled RED, WHITE AND ZERO, this is not that feature, but only the second segment, THE WHITE BUS, from that unhappy trilogy film.  THE WHITE BUS is by far the best of the three segments but I was disappointed at the omission of the other two.

RED, WHITE AND ZERO was the brainchild of stage producer Oscar Lewenstein who was brought to Woodfall Films by its co-owner, Tony Richardson. After helping to found the documentary film movement, Free Cinema, along with Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz, Richardson embarked on a successful directing career at the Royal Court Theatre.  It was there that he directed John Osborne's ground breaking play, LOOK BACK IN ANGER.  Richardson and Osborne brought the play to the screen and started their own production company, Woodfall Films.  Woodfall soldiered on after LOOK BACK IN ANGER with many other successful films and in 1963 managed to crack the American market with TOM JONES, establishing Richardson as, many thought, THE director of the 1960s.  Because of this, United Artists entered into a very generous deal with Woodfall providing finance and artistic freedom. This allowed Woodfall to branch out and make films such as THE KNACK and THE GIRL WITH GREEN EYES.

When Lewenstein came to Woodfall he envisioned a trilogy picture with each part directed by one of the three Free Cinema directors.  Lindsay Anderson began working with Shelagh Delaney on a script from her collection of stories called SWEETLY SINGS THE DONKEY and Karel Reisz began working with David Mercer on his play A SUITABLE CASE FOR TREATMENT. Reisz decided his film would best be a feature film and withdrew from the project.  He was replaced by Peter Brook.  It was decided that Richardson and Brook would also film Shelagh Delaney stories, giving the film a thematic cohesion.  Anderson finished his segment first and it was screened for the producer and directors.  Brook and Richardson left the screening without saying anything and later announced they were going to jettison their Delaney stories and make films that were more personal to themselves.  In the end Richardon made RED AND BLUE, a rather dull musical featuring Michael York and Vanessa Redgrave, and Peter Brook made a hopelessly unfunny ""silent"" comedy with Zero Mostel.  Lindsay Anderson suggested the title RED, WHITE AND ZERO and the film was delivered to United Artists who, quite rightly, shelved it.

Unfortunately, THE WHITE BUS is far too good to go unseen.  Attempts to screen it were made.  It played in New York with a Chezch film called DAISIES, in 1979 the University of North Texas screened it and with the print from that showing, RED, WHITE AND ZERO was screened in New York and quietly made available to the art house circuit from United Artists Classics.

The WHITE BUS was Lindsay Anderson's shift from realism (THIS SPORTING LIFE) to the poetic (IF.... and O LUCKY MAN!)  It was the first of three of his films to be photographed by Miroslav Ondricek and it was a black and white film using occasional scenes of colour which led to the monochrome scenes of IF.... which was otherwise a colour film.  Even if it weren't a beautiful film poem, THE WHITE BUS would be important if only as a chronical of the first step of a visionary film director.",1324944000,9,3273,4.884267631103074
