8028621,5,B0002KVUPW,"I'm 27 years old, most people think I'm too young to know who Roy Rogers is. But I know a good movie when I see it. The story start with Roy and The Sons of the Pioneers in New York City trying to get a record contract and they are swindled out of all their money, when they get a telegram saying that Gabby (Hazy) is dying and they need to go back to home to Oklahoma. But with no money they get a personal lone from Peggy Lane (Dale Evans), a reluctantly she gives them $300.16 to go home. There is an old feud between Grandma Lane and Gabby Whittaker. When Roy, the Pioneers and Peggy arrive in Oklahoma that's when the real fun starts.",1465084800,,639,4.079365079365079

8028626,4,B0002KVUPW,"This movie carries me back when I was a kid at the Saturday morning matinee rooting for the good guys. The Saturday morning matinee included comedies, cartoons, a weekly serial and two westerns and it only cost 10 cents. I'm 73 years young, but still a child at heart. This movie has been re-mastered and the quality of this movie is great. If you are a Roy Rogers fan, I suggest you add this to your collection. I'm glad I did.

8028628,4,B0002KVUPW,Man from Oklahoma is more a comedy than a western. But it is very elegant and entertaining though you miss hard riding and gunfire. If you love Rogers and are in family-movie mood you are in good hands. The playing in double sense between Dale Evans and George Hayes and Roy Rogers is great. The Picture is sharp and the sound likewise in top.,1367539200,,343,4.375
