8435788,5,B004M9QNQK,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.  Thanks for making this section of history available.",1398643200,,367,4.447761194029851

8435790,5,B004M9QNQK,"The History Channel did an absolute amazing job in this documentary about Andrew Jackson. It was very educational. You will learn the good & the bad of Andrew Jackson. He was a hero to the common man but a demon to Native Americans`. Learn about his early life, his military life, & ultimately his Presidency.  You will meet the love of his life & you will march with him into the battles. He outsmarted the British down in Louisiana & won all the battles. He took control of Florida & made it a state. He was Florida's first governor! He hated paper money yet he ended up on the $20.00 bill. He believed Washington was corrupt & needed change. He was the people's president & people flocked to him at the White House. He cheated death many times! He suffered the loss of his wife just before he would be sworn into the office of the presidency. This History Channel Presentation is well worth the price. You will learn so much about our 7th President Andrew Jackson!",1351468800,12,967,4.463276836158192
