7084312,5,B00VA32GHQ,It has taken CBS a long time to get this to market I've had seasons 1-3 for a long time hurray about time,1448236800,,105,3.608695652173913
7084313,5,B00VA32GHQ,Great series that should have lasted longer. Sure could use Nash Bridges today on TV.,1446681600,,85,4.733333333333333

7084321,5,B00VA32GHQ,"It's Don Johnson- in a cool car- with a funny side kick. Seriously, what's not to like? So glad the show is finally out on DVD!",1440720000,,127,3.923076923076923
7084322,5,B00VA32GHQ,"What can I say except Nash Bridges-Season 5 is just great.  Don Johnson and Cheech Marin are a great team. I have season 1, 2, 3, 4, and now
Season 5.  I have been trying to find out when Season 6 (final season) will be available to buy so I can finish my collection.  This was one of the
best shows on television.  I wish they could bring it back.  If you like great police shows, this one is it.",1440547200,,397,3.9125
7084323,5,B00VA32GHQ,As described.  On time.,1438992000,,23,4.75
7084324,5,B00VA32GHQ,I just love this series. Too bad it didn't run longer. A great buy.,1438646400,,67,3.857142857142857
7084325,5,B00VA32GHQ,"This is one of my favorite series, and though there are a few minor glitches with the DVDs, there is nothing that I can't live with.  If the set had a ""play all"" option for each disk, it would be much better, but, all in all, I am very happy with the set.",1438560000,,255,3.811320754716981
7084326,5,B00VA32GHQ,I have been looking for the last 3 seasons but they were priced out of my range--glad it's finally at a reasonable price,1438560000,,120,4.260869565217392
7084327,5,B00VA32GHQ,"I was hesitant to buy it because of some reviews I read of bad DVD's, skipping, no play, etc. I've been waiting for the full series for a long time so I finally bought it. I didn't have any problems. I watched seasons 4-6 with no issues.",1437868800,3,237,4.0638297872340425
7084328,5,B00VA32GHQ,Great tv series...Love this show.,1437264000,,33,5.8
7084329,5,B00VA32GHQ,Great casting and perfect for reminiscing.,1437091200,,42,6.166666666666667
7084330,4,B00VA32GHQ,"This copy does not work as well as the others.  Once an episode plays, it does not automatically move to the next episode, if you are not paying attention, you will push play on the same episode that had just completed.  This season is done almost as if some one taped if off the TV and tried to put it in shape.  I kept it because I had waited a long time for the Nash Bridges series.  After the first three seasons, everything stopped.  then you came out with the entire six seasons, which I wouldn't buy because I had the earlier copies.  it is as if two different companies released the first half as opposed the second half.",1436659200,,629,4.243697478991597
7084331,5,B00VA32GHQ,"Just finished watching this season of Nash, and think it might be the best one yet.  There is lots of action and humor, and of course Nash (pretty much like Don Johnson himself) is just too damn charming, you can't help but like him even though he goes from one woman to another without much of a break in between ... he clearly loves women of all ages, and they are all happy to indulge him.  Aside from all of that, there is really solid acting, a true depth to the relationships between the main characters.  I think the best acting in this season is from Jaime P. Gomez, as Evan who reaches rock bottom and climbs his way back to a meaningful life, and from Jeff Perry, as Harvey, in one of the final scenes, cleaning out Evan's desk.  There are no words, just raw emotion that left me with a lump in my throat.  Great show, wish Evan's character had not been written out, and wish there were more than one more season to look forward to.  And ... maybe I mentioned this in a previous review, but I think Nash is a pre-cursor to Gibbs of NCIS .... from the clothes, the rules, the complicated private life ....",1436140800,4,1114,4.2559241706161135

8709683,5,B00VA32GHQ,"I can't help it!  I love Nash Bridges!!  Yes, I know he's a fictional character, but oh, what a terrific fictional character he is.  I mean.. he's sexy, romantic, focused, smart, and always a gentleman.  I had to own the whole series!",1460592000,2,234,4.5
8709684,5,B00VA32GHQ,Great show,1459209600,,10,4.5
8709685,5,B00VA32GHQ,"We love the whole Nash thing, but this season is special.  The descent of Evan and the way he was able to find to return is something you don't see very often.  There was some depth to this season that made it stand out.  They way these issues were handled by the show was singular.  I don't remember any other show dealing with this theme this clearly.",1457654400,2,353,4.223880597014926
