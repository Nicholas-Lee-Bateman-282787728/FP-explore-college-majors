2862766,5,B000R9COGM,The three ladies put their plan in motion but they find that things don't go as planned or appear as they seem. Another great DVD lost classic!,1193616000,4,143,4.333333333333333
2862767,1,B000R9COGM,"This is an extremely weak film from 1932 presented in a lousy print.  The production and the acting are so crude, that one would think that this came from 1929 or 1930.  The story is a familiar one: gold-digging girls.  Audiences were supposed to be titillated by the sight of ladies in underwear, plus all the drinking, smoking, and conniving.  The movie may be of interest to film students, and even Joan Blondell freaks.  But it's a solid loser, and certainly not worth the $9.95 price.  I'm not reselling my copy; I'm tossing it.",1187395200,5,533,4.617021276595745

8199573,1,B000R9COGM,"I know many of the reviewers liked the film, but I didn't. I generally love pictures from the '30s, but I found this one boring. There didn't seem to be anything to it - the story line was minimal and the acting was poor. It was as if the director had randomly picked people off the street and said, ""wanna be in pictures?""  I kept thinking if I gave it some time it would improve, but it didn't. I finally gave up and didn't bother to finish watching it.

On the positive side, there's a very young Joan Blondell who went on to become a very popular actress and it was fun to see her in what must have been the beginning of her career.

Overall, there are lots of other movies of the same genre and timeframe that I think you'd find more entertaining.",1409788800,,752,4.172413793103448
8199574,5,B000R9COGM,"This movie was pretty funny I enjoyed seeing this movie. For the first time it was kinda grainy.
But movies in those days might have been. It's interesting to see the technology back then.
The actresses we're great they played their roles wonderfully Joan Blondell what a lovely lady.
I wonder what she might have said about actresses today. Anyway, with a little fixing of this movie
I would enjoy seeing it again. I enjoying seeing the classics they are AMERICA'S rich history and
story telling of people in those days. Sadly only one class of people we're shown to be well off.
And doing well while others suffered so much as well of today. But this movie had great quality
and of friendship. Even though sometimes friends do hurt each other but forgiveness comes
in like a flood. Which is lacking today with bitterness and unforgiveness and never
speaking to each other for years. This movie put laughter back into ones heart which is so
badly need today. I am not a movie buff person but I do hope folks will take time to see this movie
and judge for themselves. Thank you for sharing without you I might have never seen this movie.
Thanks! Again.",1390521600,,1152,4.570048309178744
8199575,3,B000R9COGM,Well acted; good story and script.  Only spoiled by the poor quality of the print and the abysmal sound track.,1385683200,2,110,4.5

8199577,5,B000R9COGM,"A wonderful romp in the New York Broadway culture of the 1920's - early 30's. This is a world where ""Zigfield Girls"" became duchesses and a dazzling smile could produce a diamond bracelet. Some may find it ""dated"", whatever that means. Nothing is dated as long as it produces delight. Some find the acting ""over dramatic"". People in the past were more demonstrative, had wit, charm and pizzaz, far more than the brunt of the vacuous automatons in todays media world. Anyone for Kim Kardashian or Torry Spelling?",1351900800,7,511,4.818181818181818
8199578,2,B000R9COGM,"Three Broadway Girls, 1932 film

""Throughout history half of all women were working women"" says the introduction. One woman calls about her flowers, the other tells about her stock purchases. A girlfriend has a problem, her boyfriend's wife showed up. ""Haven't I met you someplace before?"" ""What's Pops to you?"" Pops likes a girl who is fun. A friend will throw a party. ""Faith, Hope, and Charity""? They meet a pianist. The talk is like from a Broadway show. They leave when the bar closes. Shall one woman begin studying the piano? ""Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies."" Is Jean manipulative?

There is a taxi accident. Feldman plays for Jean, then they break up. A telephone call says Pops passed. A phonograph record has Pops' last speech. Later they meet for afternoon tea. Will Jean pull a trick? Paulaire meets her fianc's father and learns the facts. Jean accuses Paulaire of taking her pearls. There is an emotional confrontation! Jean practices her speech for the wedding, she will marry the rich father and get $1,000,000! Can she say goodbye to her friends? There is a big surprise at the wedding.

This was adapted from a Broadway play of the 1920, and tells about the culture of that time. This prosperity soon became a memory, it melted away like snow beneath a summer's sun. It is also a comment on the nouveau riche, Manhattan society, and their crowd. It seems dated today. Would this story be echoed in other films? [This was also named ""The Greeks Had a Word for Them"".]",1266883200,3,1499,4.670454545454546
8199579,3,B000R9COGM,This pre-code teaser on DVD has some titilating scenes but the transfer process is truly bad.  The film is now 75+ years old and it shows.  The image quality hasn't improved since I bought this public domain film on VHS some 25 years ago.  I doubt anyone will spend the time or money to try and restore it.  Recommended for Joan Blondell fans and pre-code fans only.,1206316800,9,366,4.417910447761194
8199580,3,B000R9COGM,"This is a great film if you are a fan of precodes and of Joan Blondell's saucy ways. Sure, it's not ""Gold Diggers of 1933"", nor is it as good as any of the precodes Joan Blondell made with James Cagney, but it is enjoyable viewing if you like that type of film. I do have to agree with the reviewer that said the print looks bad. It appears not to have been touched up at all - just another unrestored copy of this public domain film. The more cost-effective way to own this film is to purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comedy-Classics-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0001HAGV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>.
