1204764,5,B00000F08K,"I saw this when it was fresh on video and it is WEIRD. Like TRACK 29 by Nicolas Roeg is weird. I liked both films. This one has 2 heavyweights of the British theater, Denholm Elliot and Joan Plowright, and a thoroughly convincing STING as ...what? An evil sprite? The devil himself? watch it and try to come to your own conclusion; that is the pleasure of this odd little gem.",1135382400,,376,4.309859154929577
1204765,4,B00000F08K,"...that's for sure! You really have to be in a certain mood to watch this ""peculiar"" movie. Sting as the Devil himself, well as a big fan I must say that the man never stops to surprise me. I really liked him in The Grotesque (with Alan Bates) as well. He always acts to be very different from the sophisticated music-performer he is and is most famous for -so it is kind of funny to see him in these kind of ""crazy"" roles. Yes, the acting in ""Brimstone..."" is very good indeed -the story, well, different. Original, and sometimes funny -other times it just makes you sick. All I can say is; looking for an alternate movie-experience with a different ""twist"" then this might be what you're looking for..? I've seen it twice, and I don't regret it!",1111708800,,747,4.420289855072464
1204766,3,B00000F08K,"Once banned on the BBC, BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE (MGM) stars Sting as Martin Taylor, a charismatic, mysterious figure who insinuates himself into the household of the Bates. Tom Bates (Denholm Elliot) writes religious literature, his wife Norma (Joan Plowright) spends her time caring for their disabled, mute, daughter. Martin doesn't know the family, but convinces the Bates that he's an old friend of their daughter and moves in to do his thing. Is Martin a demon or an angel?  See what happens when the daughter recovers her speech.",1063670400,6,533,5.056818181818182
1204767,1,B00000F08K,"Sting infiltrates a house and assualts a semi-comatose woman. Yuck! Misogynist, vile claptrap posing as an art film. Run away! Fast! If you want to see a similar story, watch the much better Theorem by Pasolini. Only surpassed in wretchedness by some Peter Greenaway movies.",1024012800,5,274,5.111111111111111
1204768,5,B00000F08K,"Tom Bates (Denholm Elliot) is a writer who pens little religious sentiments for things like greeting cards and hymns. His wife, Norma (Joan Plowright), is a kind and longsuffering woman who spends countless hours looking after their daughter, Patricia (Suzanna Hamilton), who is disabled. After what was thought to be a freak car-pedestrian accident, Patricia needs round-the-clock care. She cannot speak, cannot dress or bathe herself, cannot feed herself and cannot even seem to be cognizant of the daily events going on around her. Tom is convinced that Patricia is mentally `gone' from them forever and she cannot understand anything said about her. Norma, on the other hand, is full of faith that Patricia can hear and understand everything. One day, everything changes. Tom, the disillusioned-with-faith writer of psalms, bumps into Martin Taylor (Sting). Martin claims to have been not just a friend of Patricia's from school, but a boyfriend who loved her enough to ask her to marry him. Tom is naturally suspicious of him, both because he fears Martin might be a con-man and because he is afraid Martin might shed some light on the reasons why Patricia had her accident in the first place. Martin finds out where the Bates family lives and drops in. Norma takes an instant liking to him and persuades Tom to let him stay with them. He and Tom have a number of minor battles but he continually bolsters his image with Norma. He seems to share her faith that God has something miraculous planned for Patricia and he even begins calling Norma ""Mumsy."" ... The climax of the film arrives late one night when Martin moves in on Patricia.  His terrible treatment of her awakens something within her and suddenly she remembers the wicked event that caused her sickness in the first place. Martin flees but the viewer is left with the knowledge that Patricia will tell all and the situation will be made right at last.
There is certainly room for speculation, particularly with the title that the film has, that the author is trying to suggest that Martin Taylor's role is not entirely evil yet not entirely good either. Rather than painting him as a demon or an angel, he is more of a character who simply sheds light on things. I consider this to be one of Sting's best film performances if not *the* best, out of his rather lackluster (and I say that with sadness, because I am a fan) movie career. I would recommend this movie to any Sting fan or any follower of Denholm Elliot's career, anyone who enjoys dark and/or indie films and definitely anyone who enjoys trying to crack a good mystery.",1010188800,23,2599,4.788418708240535
1204769,4,B00000F08K,"I tend to agree with the other reviews that are posted here,but I would like to make one distinction.  I thought the movie had a truly unique ""surprise"" ending.  ...  Brimstone and Treacle is a great life lesson about learning to embrace adversity and taking responsability for your actions.  I loved it, and I'm buying it so I can show it to my friends!",967075200,,354,4.484375
1204770,4,B00000F08K,"When this came out it was considered an on the edge film.  It's a bit violent and the play with good vs. evil can cause some to get upset.  But if you are seeing Brimstone and Treacle for the first time in the 2000's,  Sting's character might seem pretty tame considering what has come out  since.  There is a lot of very nice acting and well written dialogue.  Definitely worth catching for any fan of the indie film or Sting.",962323200,3,427,4.275
1204771,4,B00000F08K,"I saw this film shortly after Dennis Potter passed away. Made in 1982, the story is about a sinister young man called Martin Taylor (played perfectly by Sting), who uses charm and flattery to move in on an unsuspecting  family. Denholm Elliott is a tormented  father torn between guilt and anger  over his daughter (Suzanna Hamilton), who has been left a helpless invalid  since she was hit by a truck four years ago. Joan Plowright is a mother  torn between hope and despair, always thinking that her daughter will one  day recover.
Martin is an enigma, full of contradictions. He is angelic  and diabolical. Sweet and sour. Good and bad. Everyone's friend and no  one's friend.
This was a good movie with excellent performances, but I  preferred the original 1976 version with Michael Kitchen. In that version  you actually see Martin change into a demon and eating breath mints to hide  the smell of sulphur. The 1982 version seems a bit more sordid. I'm hoping  one day the 1976 version will come out on video, which would have a PG  rating. The latter version really deserves an R rating.",947635200,3,1093,4.71957671957672
1204772,5,B00000F08K,"Dennis Potter is for many the most challenging and thought proving dramatist of our generation. Brimstone and Treacle does not quite reach the heady hights of Pennies from Heaven or the Singing Detective in terms of its invention but possibly exceeds them in its power to challenge thoughts  around conventional morality. Who is the villain in this piece? Is it the  Sting character preying pervertedly upon an innocent, or is it the father  whose infidelity triggered off the whole chain of events in the first  instance. The intervention of the ""pervert"" releases the heroine  from her coma, liberates the mother from her drudgery and exposes the  father. In reality no harm is done to the girl. Is therefore Sting a Devil  or an  Angel, does harm sometimes need to be done to create good? The film  improves enormously on the TV play with brilliant casting, an evocotive  atmosphere and excellent music. Sting was perfectly cast. Watch it and  start to think!",945129600,5,962,4.913043478260869
1204773,4,B00000F08K,"33. BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE (thriller-drama, 1982) Martin (Sting) befriends middle-aged bookkeeper Tom (Denholm Elliott). Martin cons his way into his house by passing himself as his daughter's, Patricia (Suzana Hamilton),  ex-boyfriend. Patricia has been left a mute and bedridden for 3 years after  a car accident. Tom's wife Nora (Joan Plowright) is very religious and  Martin's 'gospely' kindness and loyalty to Patricia impress her. Though Tom  is suspicious of Martin's exact motives he nonetheless stays to take care  of Patricia. What they don't know is that Martin is sexually abusing their  defenseless daughter.
Critique: Part fairy tale, part religious parable,  this creepy, atmospheric film is highlighted by a wickedly perverse turn by  Sting (lead singer of rock group 'The Police'). What makes his character  such a bizarre figure is that his motives are unknown, his appetites  unresolved. I think Martin is just a thief, passing himself as anyone's  friend just to have a place to stay. A sort of pickpocket. He's also a  sexual deviant who doesn't mind how he gets it, either from an invalid or  an old woman. The film portrays him as an avenging angel-type brought into  Tom's household to uncover some truths. Interesting direction by Richard  Loncraine (is this his film debut?) who works from a play adapted by Dennis  Potter (who's own sexually dubious works are to be questioned). 'The  Police', along with 'The Go-Gos' provided the music.",917913600,,1463,5.210300429184549
1204874,5,B00000F08K,"Terrific movie -- Sting is spot on as titular character -- is he Brimstone or Treacle or both?!? One of the best performances I have seen by the late, great Denholm Elliot (you are missed!).",1383696000,,190,4.457142857142857

1204876,3,B00000F08K,Loved the movie especially since I'm a big Sting fan.  The music was great the acting by Sting was right up his alley...the beguiling and coy personality was donr without a hitch. Would like to have seen more of the young girl talking because I feel she could've brought more of a lighter side to the movie but I had no problem with the flick.,1361232000,,343,4.276923076923077
1204877,4,B00000F08K,"This is a very underrated little film.  Don't be scared away just because Sting is in it...he is actually very well cast here, having the perfect face for this quirkily creepy role.  The plot raises many questions about whether the means sometimes justify the ends in life, and how sometimes good is spawned by the wicked.  The dark, autumnal atmosphere, great title and closing graphics, and the strange twists of plot, leave one puzzled but pleased when all is said and done.  The soundtrack is a bit mixed...some songs should've been left out, but many of the moodier pieces work quite well.  I recommend this film highly!",1323129600,2,625,4.803738317757009

The claustrophobic house interior set conveys the isolation hanging over the housewife who is a sole caregiver to Patty, her brain-damaged but beautiful only child while her husband travels into the city where he owns a religious imprints publishing house. Martin slyly enters their sheltered existence through an ""accidental"" meeting and soon divides the household emotionally-is he an angel the wife has been praying for or is he the devil himself the husband fears? Butter wouldn't melt in Martin's mouth as he seduces the viewer as well. He brings about positive changes but in a really backhanded way and there is hell to pay for the wicked!

Bonus-it has a fabulous IRS Records soundtrack featuring The Go-Gos (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-The-Beat/dp/B000001I0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty & The Beat</a>), The Police (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Police-2CD-Anthology/dp/B000PHX4VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Police (2CD Anthology)</a>), etc. Sting in drag is not to be missed and pay close attention to the prayers said in the parlor!!

1204880,2,B00000F08K,"The transition from play to film rarely works; 'Sleuth' and 'the Anniversary' spring to mind as successes, but the over-riding memory of these contrary things is those messy Joe Orton adaptations of the 60's, all garish colour and frenzied editing.
It's as if the directors of the films want to make up for the inevitable staginess of the plays by projecting them as far away as possible from their original concepts. Imbuing them with sex and outrage to 'modernise' them for audiences who wouldn't be seen dead at the National or the Everyman, and still think plays are the realm of a hideous time 'before we had the telly.'
Adaptations from TV are slightly different in that they have already been filmed, but generally fall into the same trap. A film director who thinks he knows better than the TV people, and in due process of stamping his own 'visionary genius' on proceedings, only succeeds in mucking things up.

'BAT' is a great example. Adapted by Dennis Potter from his own original and clunkily directed by Richard Loncraine, it's a resolute disaster from start to finish.

Potter's original was a morality comedy where the devil (Martin {!}) comes to stay with a lower middle class couple and their brain-damaged daughter. Much satire about demons and sulphur ensues, and brilliant gags such as Satan spotting a picture of Mick Jagger in the girls bedroom:
""Hello old pal"" he growls.

Potter's bile is considerably distilled by Satan's virtual (catastrophic!!) removal - in fact the devil is hardly touched on - which turns his pitch-black notions from a shocking drama into merely a slightly perverse thriller.
The devil is transformed from being the malignant central core of the piece, to a survivalist, opportunistic con-man.

Sting plays Martin, and is poor in the role (tho' he does show commendable shirtlessness, and indeed trouserlessness in a hammy, mock Ken Russell dream sequence), and it'll come as no surprise to hear the horrifically over-rated Police do the banal soundtrack. All worthy ethnic instruments and dullness.

It's left to stalwarts Denholm Elliot and Joan Plowright, as the girls parents, to salvage something from the film. Plowright is vacantly inane and Elliot's performance is so intense, it's scarier than the villain's.

With the devil absent, the 'sting' in the tale has been drawn and it's left for Loncraine to utilise standard substitutes. Other films are relentlessly referenced with little effect, most noticeably the shadow on the house night shot from 'the Exorcist'; Loncraine dumbly telling us that this is no spiritual redeemer arriving.(Wow! Never woulda guessed.) Plowright listens to Squeeze's 'Up the Junction' in the hairdressers, a back reference to Peter Collinson's excellent film, itself part of a gritty neo-realism that 'BAT' would dearly love to find itself in the vanguard of.

The play was set in an ordinary terraced house, increasing the sense of the intrusion of 'normalcy'. Here, we're in a classic horror film mansion, all gales and flashing lightning. Foreboding even before young Gordon arrives.
Although acting isn't Sting's strong-point (see 'Dune' or 'Quadrophenia' for irrefutable evidence), he does do creepy and ingratiating rather well, but some of the exchanges;
""We don't use tea-bags"",
""I can tell. I can tell you're not that sort of lady at all"" which might work with a better actor, seem trite and forced to the extreme with Sting.
He listens to the atrocious Go-Go's on the radio (while dressed in women's clothes. Yay!) a device surely employed to make the Police sound good, and he drifts through the film without a hint of the required undercurrent menace.

The central premise that a severely brain-damaged woman (no more than a gurgling vegetable) can be cured by having sex with a handsome young rake is quite offensive too, even to my jaded and corrupt sensibilities, but it's the only thing in 'BAT' that makes any kind of sense.
Loncraine has a wretched view of mankind. All the sweaty, adulterous father's fears and suspicions are vindicated, just when he seems to be accepting that not every-one in the world is as shallow and devious as he is.
Oh, and the plot-twist at the end is idiotic and rotten.

The BBC play is now available on dvd, so I'd go for that. Don't let salacious thoughts of a butt-nekkid Sting sway you to Loncraine's flop.
I'm tempted to give it an extra star for the performances of Elliot and Plowright but at 3 stars I'd be lying to you.",1205452800,5,4463,4.971849865951743
1204881,5,B00000F08K,"Brimstone and Treacle 1982 - I loved this movie.  Sting is very good in this movie as the devil's or perhaps the angel's advocate to help a family resolve their emotional problems.  Sting's character, Martin Taylor, is the catalyst to help the Bates family expose their family secrets and bring their daughter Patricia back into the world from her self imposed hiding.  She needed an emotional shock to bring her back to her family.  This is the second version of this movie, with the first produced in the 1970s and banned by the BBC for about 15 years.  This version is a little lighter but tells the story well.",1195862400,,614,4.5963302752293576
1204882,5,B00000F08K,"To quote a review I remember reading when this film came out, ""Never have nice manners seemed so menacing."" This is a creepy film - without doubt. Some people will definitely be freaked out by some of the subject manner. However, nothing is quite as it seems in this movie.

Sting does a damn fine job of acting here. I don't think anyone other than Sting could have done justice to the lead role, except perhaps a young Malcolm McDowell. The script by Dennis Potter is very smart too. I won't summarize the plot as others have already done so.

What I like is all the questions that pop up in your head that the film refuses to answer. Is Martin just the father's personal demon? His guilty conscience personified? Is Martin good or evil? Is he neither?

This film deserves much more attention than it got. It was on video tape only briefly in the U.S. and was unavailble for more than a decade.

Thankfully, this DVD came along. A good weird little film for when you are in a slightly strange mood.",1183680000,,1000,4.418478260869565

Actually, the perfect role for Sting. Denholm Elliott is superb, and Joan Plowright is well...Joan Plowright - what can you say, she's an amazing person. Sting managed to get the other Policemen into a studio and cut a couple of tracks for the soundtrack, and did the rest of the score himself.
