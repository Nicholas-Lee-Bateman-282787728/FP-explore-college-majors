What accurate history there was in the film was distorted, without context and, incredibly, the characters portrayed (other than Che Guevara)were either fictional or not sufficiently identified. The CIA operative Felix Rodriguez (a Cuban) who aided the Bolivians in Che's capture, was played as an Anglo by John Ireland!! One of the most egregious historical errors in the film is that Che's entire force is shown to be wiped out in the Yuro Ravine when, in fact, four made it out, into Chile and thereafter to Cuba. Lastly, the film just began and ended without any credits at all. Guess they were really proud of their work. Total garbage.",1297036800,,798,4.7898550724637685
8406334,2,B003V19CM2,"What you see is what you get - there is a scene in the middle with a family scurrying across the village square under the bell tower, could be out of any other film - fantastic - acting wooden - historical accuracy, who cares.

If you collect all things Che it is another item to add to the hoard.",1279670400,,297,4.033898305084746
