2468243,5,B000CPH9UM,"I saw ZOMBIE HONEYMOON at the Fantasia Festival, and I am very glad I did.  I was expecting a silly movie, a good laugh in a B-movie kind of way, because of the title. However, this is not a B movie at all. It is a great film.  It is one of my top 5 Zombie movies of all time, it is THAT GOOD.",1136764800,2,293,3.5625
2468244,5,B000CPH9UM,"I was lucky enough to get to see this film while it was touring the festival circuit still and am very happy it has found distribution! Being a zombie filmmaker myself, er, a filmmaker of zombie movies, I found the story to be refreshing and extremely well done. The acting is great, story solid and the gore is STILL THERE. It's a great love story beyond the undead element, and that truly sets it apart. Zombies are innately haunting - something about the aspect of them still being far too human than the other undead monsters out there. Dave Gebroe and his cast and crew take this aspect even further and allow the audience to truly feel for this couple. Buy it, you'll love it!",1136764800,2,682,4.464
2468245,5,B000CPH9UM,"I saw this movie in October during its theatrical release, and I've never seen anything like it.  I read an interview with the writer/director Dave Gebroe on zombiehoneymoon.com where he explained he was trying to combine the domestic drama of Cassavetes' ""A Woman Under The Influence"" with the zombie splatter of the George Romero films.  Well, he definitely achieved his goal.  ""Zombie Honeymoon"" is unbelievably gripping--it's apparently about Gebroe's sister and her late husband, who died in a surfing accident.  You can tell there's something different about the movie as soon as it begins, there's a love for the characters you never feel in this genre, and a lot of the horror comes from that.  Not from creative kills or overdone gore (although the effects are great), but from a vested interest in the characters' survival--how novel!  For a movie with such a cheesy-sounding title, it's totally unexpected how emotionally affecting it is.  I actually had tears in my eyes at the end.  Not only do I not typically watch many horror films (I saw it because of all the good reviews it had been getting), but I've definitely never cried in a horror film.  Ever.  Gebroe's obviously going places, and I can't wait to see what he's up to next.  The DVD apparently has tons & tons of extras on it--I'm going to buy it and spread the word to everyone I know.",1136592000,,1361,4.773504273504273
2468273,2,B000CPH9UM,"This film was ridiculous.  This woman KNOWS he is killing strangers and eating them and then KNOWS he started killing friends.  But, only when he starts after HER does her love for him desert her.

2468274,3,B000CPH9UM,"Sometimes ""I'm sorry"" just doesn't cut it; for example: ""I'm sorry I cheated on you,"" ""I'm sorry I didn't tell you about all the years I spent in prison,"" and of course ""I'm sorry I ate your best friend.""  If you want to read something meaningful into the plot of Zombie Honeymoon (treating it as an allegory of someone having to deal with a spouse's deadly drug addiction or something), go right ahead - as for me, I saw little here beyond a gory cheesefest.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I would argue that Zombie Honeymoon eventually turns into a tedious, long drawn out affair well before the end credits finally roll.  The romance angle just doesn't work when one of the two lovebirds is spurting blood like a geyser and eating friends as well as strangers.  If I'm not mistaken, though, this is the only film featuring a zombie criticizing someone for smoking.

Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are newlyweds beginning a month-long honeymoon somewhere on the Jersey shore.  They're having a grand old time until some wretched-looking stranger crawls up out of the ocean and pukes a bucketful of blood and guts all over Danny's face.  Denise's worst nightmare comes true when Danny dies from the attack.  10 minutes later, though, her greatest wish comes true when Danny suddenly wakes up and says he's fine.  They do the thing that newlyweds do, and they even make spontaneously momentous plans for the future, so everything must be fine and dandy, right?  That's what Denise thinks until she comes home from shopping the next day to find her husband covered in the blood of the man he is eating.  For pretty much every person on Earth, this would pretty much be the end of the marriage - but we're talking about a woman who wore a gaudy red wedding dress.  The irony of Denise's total commitment to her wedding vows is the fact that her husband is technically dead, thus rendering those vows null and void.  As you might expect, it soon becomes more and more difficult for Denise to stand by her man as his uncontrollable hunger for human flesh increases and he begins to take on the appearance of the living dead.

Zombie Honeymoon tries to straddle a line of its own creation, strung between horror, comedy, and romance.  Frankly, I don't think it succeeds all that well, as I felt no real sympathy for either Danny or Denise.  (Reportedly, the story was actually inspired by the unfortunate death of director David Gebroe's young brother-in-law soon after his marriage.)  Still, it certainly makes for a new and interesting take on the often-boring zombie theme, and I can't say this is a film without merit.  I don't think it will have much appeal to non-horror fans, though, simply because it's pretty bloody and probably a little bit disgusting to those who don't appreciate the sight of copious amounts of fake blood.  You never actually see Danny ripping out someone's internal organs, but he is a really messy eater (and, for some reason, he has a hard time keeping his meals down, if you know what I mean).  Zombie fans should definitely check this one out, though.",1230508800,,3108,4.709796672828096
2468275,2,B000CPH9UM,"I know I'm going to get it for this one, but this movie is pretty bad. While I like the premise, the film is too tame to be scary, played too straight to be funny and too silly to care about the characters! There I said it!....in short this movie is a c r a p - fest! If the makers of this film had just picked a path and stayed on it, this would be a much better film.

I won't even touch on the plot holes as the film is too absurd to be taken, for anything other than someone's fantasy nightmare! It plays like an episode of 'Tales From The Dark Side'(not one of the better ones). On the plus side the low budget has good acting and FX. If you must see it, watch it on cable, it's not for everyone's taste ....certainly not mine.......and yes, I do get the film. OK, I'm bracing myself...........!",1224460800,2,800,4.031446540880503
2468276,4,B000CPH9UM,"Newbie director David Gebroe's ZOMBIE HONEYMOON (2004) is one of those independent horror flicks that belies its bargain-basement budget and, on several levels, successfully surpasses many of the crappy big-budget movies that Hollywood currently tries to pass off as good horror.  For genre fans who appreciate good indie alternatives to Hollywood dreck, it will come as no surprise that ZOMBIE HONEYMOON was co-produced by Glass Eye Pix, the production and distribution company of the venerable independent horror auteur Larry Fessenden, which has produced and distributed other interesting indie horror flicks such as I SELL THE DEAD (2007), THE ROOST (2005), and Fessenden's own exceptional film HABIT (1997).

On the surface, ZOMBIE HONEYMOON tells the story of young newlyweds whose honeymoon falls to ruins when the groom comes into contact with a zombie and thereafter slowly deteriorates into a member of the flesh-eating undead.  However, viewers who read between the lines will realize that the film is really an allegory of how disease or mental illness can impact even the strongest of relationships.  In that respect, it is similar in plotting to David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of the classic horror film THE FLY. Yet, even though Cronenberg did it first with a bigger budget and high-profile actors, ZOMBIE HONEYMOON is every bit as effective and affecting as Cronenberg's piece, and it is thereby definitely worthy of the attention of true horror aficionados. Unlike THE FLY, ZOMBIE HONEYMOON is not really a film for gorehounds--the special FX in ZOMBIE HONEYMOON are convincing and effective, but they are definitely kept at a minimum--but the lack of grue doesn't detract from the horror or the effectiveness of the emotional level of the plot and story.

The principal actors in ZOMBIE HONEYMOON may not be enormously famous, but they do an impressive job.  Especially effective is Tracy Coogan.  As new bride Denise, she convincingly conveys the slow emotional breakdown of a young woman who must watch as the love of her life deteriorates into a flesh-eating ghoul.  Graham Sibley does a fine job has her zombified husband, and veteran actor Neal Jones gives a very entertaining performance in the supporting role of a police officer who is investigating the disappearance of the young husband's victims.

The soundtrack to ZOMBIE HONEYMOON should delight any hardcore genre fan who is deeply ensconced in Horror as a lifestyle.  The auditory surprises include tracks by the legendary Psycho Psurf band The Brimstones; fellow psurfer bands The Fathoms, The Space Cossacks, and The MelTones (who have contributed psycho tunes to to TV's SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS); and Psychobilly band The Photon Torpedoes.

Showtime Entertainment's DVD release of ZOMBIE HONEYMOON is well worth amazon.com's low admission price.  The film is presented in a crisp, clear digital transfer in anamorphic widescreen, and audio options include a nice Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound track.  Extras include two feature commentaries--one with stars Tracy Coogan and Graham Sibley, the other with writer & director Dave Gebroe--a behind-the-scenes featurette, relevant excerpts from the documentary HORROR BUSINESS, and more. If you're a serious fan of the horror genre and haven't seen this film already, you'll definitely want to pick up a copy of the DVD and discover for yourself why the film won FANGORIA magazine's 2006 Chainsaw award.",1224288000,,3427,5.347583643122676
2468277,2,B000CPH9UM,"Danny and Denise are still in the glorious days of nuptial bliss, roaming the peaceful beaches and woods surrounding their borrowed honeymoon home. Their joy is complete, their bliss never ending, until that oh so fateful day when a bedraggled zombie walks out of the surf, hunger urging it onward to attack an unsuspecting Danny. Luckily, Danny survives, waking in the hospital after having been technically dead for ten minutes. The disaster has been averted, Danny is alive and well, shaken (but not stirred) by his gruesome encounter . . . or so they think. It's time dear friends, for the honeymoon bliss to begin and as Danny starts to inexplicably change, acquiring a taste for some rather succulent looking neighbors, Denise must decide whether it's worth the pain (and the carpet stains) to stand by her man. The romance, the love, the evening walks, and the occasional devoured friend . . . its time for romance zombie style! Remember, zombie love can break your heart.

What, you ask, possesses anyone to watch a movie entitled Zombie Honeymoon? Doesn't the title just say it all? The love, the betrayal, the endless rounds of cheesiness. Oh the pain, the pain. Indeed, I viewed this on Chiller Channel's weekend marathon of the top ten cheesiest horror movies of all time (aptly titled The Cheese Fest) and I must admit, the movie was worthy of the title. Still, the film did have its redeeming qualities including, most importantly, a unique, if underdeveloped, plotline. The idea of a newlywed couple experiencing such an unbearably painful tragedy is surprisingly sorrowful and emotional for a movie that otherwise promises to be a cornball funfest. Zombie Honeymoon employed a unique study of human emotion and artistic license when Denise discovered her husband's degeneration and, instead of running from his pleading, decides to support and help him in this time of need. In so doing, the nebulous plotline took shape (somewhat) and the drama announced its main theme: just how far should one go for love? Is it ""till death do us part"" or really ""till undeath do us part?"" The answer, while done zombie style, overcame the air of corniness and inspired the viewer toward productive thought concerning the meaning of life, love, and mutating strains of zombie viruses. Because of this interesting plotline, the viewer is inspired to continue watching the movie, despite its other not-so-great elements.

Likewise, the film possessed one other redeeming quality - - - the exploitation of sadness to induce empathy. While Danny was wimp zombie extraordinaire, Denise portrayed her role quite nicely, leading the viewer to sympathize with her situation and her dying romance. Indeed, despite the film's low budget and aura of cheesiness the main actors including Tracy Coogan, Graham Sibley, Tonya Cornelisse, David M. Wallace, and Neal Jones portrayed their roles surprisingly well lending a palpable dose of human emotion and drama that calls for the viewer's empathy and interest.

And now, as they say, for the hour of truth - - - onward to the film's copious compilation of cons. Firstly, while the plot was ingenious, its production was not. As a part of the Cheese Fest, the movie contained more plot holes than a treasure trove of Swiss cheese and the viewer was compelled to fall into each one (over and over again). Danny's new appetite and his subsequent remorse cause some sticky situations, causing him to occasionally lash out at pedestrians, friends, beach goers, etc all in public places within full viewer of the unnecessarily slow witted police department who, although there is a zombiefied man covered in blood prowling the streets, swinging dismembered limbs, just can't figure out what is happening to all these missing people. Huh? I may not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but I am pretty sure that if someone started chewing on people in my presence, I'd notice. And, considering all the numerous times Danny's appetite catches him in, shall we say precarious circumstances, logic dictates that, eventually, even the dimmest witted individual would notice.

Of course, with Danny's newly acquired ""taste"" action is required - - - eventually. It never occurs to either of our characters that, perchance, this new phase of binge eating isn't going to stop and maybe measures should be taken. You see, in the world of zombie lore there are two kinds of zombies (1.) scary zombie --- a slave to his appetites --- he is an evil menace to the world sparing no one in his unbridled carnage and (2.) wimp zombie --- he takes the world on, one bite at a time, killing and maiming with manners --- he apologizes when he bites into your arm. There, we have it now folks, gentlemen zombie! He may eat your family, but he'll do it with style and sympathy. And so, the movie pokes along, detailing Danny's wailings of sorrow and misery as he munches his way through Denise's fav friends. Eventually, somebody remembers that stories should have direction and so Danny and Denise come up with a plan to save the day --- they're going to Portugal. Yep, that makes sense. I definitely see how that is going to solve the problem. And, considering Danny's new proclivity, a fourteen hour plane ride is a really good idea.

After much ado about nothing, spiced in with a few surrealistic scenes of true merit, the movie rushes forward to a conclusion that is, quite frankly, dissatisfying. Nothing is ever truly explained, the zombie plague is just as much of a mystery as when the film started, and the concluding song (a cheerful little country ballad) shatters the entire atmosphere of brooding sadness that the movie had managed to successfully maintain. So much potential, so little satisfaction.

And onto one more complaint that may not be totally fair, the movie was exceedingly gross. Now, considering that the title is Zombie Honeymoon and that the intro is filled with chewing sounds, it is more than apparent that the movie never claimed to be anything other than what it is. Still, caveat emptor, the production will turn your stomach so if you need a new diet regime, consider watching this before every meal.

Conclusion: Essence of the Zombie --- to watch or not to watch

Zombie Honeymoon was a rare cheese fest film in that the basis behind the plot was actually pretty ingenious but the production just wasn't there. The film does have some merit, and to its credit, it keeps the viewer curious enough to watch until the conclusion. This is a movie that isn't for the general populace. I would only suggest this film for those who are extreme zombie and cheese fest fans. Proceed with caution ... most people won't like this.

2468278,4,B000CPH9UM,"Brief: A horror comedy about two young and very happily married lovers who find their devotion suddenly challenged when, on the first day of their beach honeymoon, the new husband is attacked by a violently sick man and awakes at the hospital with a hunger for more than his bride's flesh.  Does their ""'til death to us part"" pledge include the deaths of local residents?

Longer: There were a group of seven of us over at my place for a movie night.  We decided to rent ""Alexander"" with Angelina Jolie et al, but because the neighborhood video store delivers with a minimum of two, my friends asked for ""Zombie Honeymoon"" on a silly whim.  None of us had heard of it.  Well, we watched about 30-40 minutes of Alexander before we declared it absolutely unwatchable and turned to Zombie instead.  We were all VERY surprised to find it well-scripted, well-acted, well-paced and with a very good balance between the horror and comedy elements.

A couple of us are die-hard horror film fans, so the expectations were for gaping plot lines and bad character decisions (e.g. ""John, what are you doing outside in the dark behind the tree with that knife? Come on in before you catch a cold!"")  But none of that in Zombie!  As a result, I can heartily recommend it.  Package it with Fido (starring Carrie-Ann Moss and Bill Connolly) and you'll have a great night.",1198195200,,1355,4.65546218487395
2468279,3,B000CPH9UM,"A zombie movie for the Lifetime channel!

1) ACTING: The acting was very good. Normally, in a low budget indie, we get all types of quality regarding acting; poor, okay, pretty good, great or excellent. The acting here had to be of good caliber, as this is not your typical zombie flick, where everyone is running around screaming and being killed off left and right. The high levels of emotion in this movie required individuals that could actually act. The actors here CAN act, and it shows. The acting was a big part of this movie, and had there been actors who could not have pulled this off, the movie would have failed.

2) PRODUCTION: For a low budget indie with no studio backing, this one was done right! The soundtrack, lighting, make up, film quality, it's all way above par with what the viewer is used to getting from indie flicks. As I mentioned above, due to the level of acting that was needed in this movie, the same level of production values was necessary as well. The movie would not have been as good as it was if the viewer was forced to make due with sub-standard effects and production values. There was an issue of continuity that was pointed out to me (Thanks HDS!) where Danny is in the ER of the hospital and dies and the heart rate machine goes off with a flatline, but Danny isn't hooked up to the machine. Oops!

3) THE ZOMBIES: Well, yes, it is plural, as there are two. The zombie that infects the husband, and eventually, the husband. Zombie lore is changed here a bit. When the husband is attacked by the zombie, the zombie vomits a black, tar-like bile into the husband's mouth and then dies. Subsequently, the husband is now ""infected with zombie."" The husband dies, returns to ""life,"" and begins his descent into zombie-dom. He acts and thinks like a normal human, just with zombie tendencies growing stronger every day. A bite from this type of zombie does not create another zombie, those individuals just die and get eaten. Passing the black tar-like substance to other people is the only way to become a zombie. It is not established if a zombie who does this, can do it repeatedly, creating many more zombies, or if it's just a one-to-one transfer.

4) THE CAUSE: The cause is never mentioned, but as mentioned before, the black substance that is transferred between zombie and victim, is how the next person turns.

5) NUDITY: Minimal boobage in a very cold room.

This was not your typical everyday zombie movie. I wonder if that is the reason for some of the negative reviews. People who went to see this may have been expecting Dawn of the Dead goes to the beach, and found out differently. This is a quality movie with many emotions that the viewer is forced to go through. Life, death, life after death. This would best be described as a ""chick flick with zombies.""

2468282,5,B000CPH9UM,"""All I am trying to do is kill as few people as possible before we get on the plane tomorrow!""

This movie is a riot! It is a clever low-budget blend of humor and horror. Unlike other attempts at mixing laughs and screams, this is truly a zombie romantic comedy. Imagine Brad and Janet (yes, from Rocky Horror) leaving  the church as the wedding couple instead of just friends, and instead of ending up at a castle inhabited by alien  sex-fiends on a dark stormy night - they go to their uncle's beach house and ""Brad"" gets turned into a zombie. Yeah, it's just like that, except it's not the 1970's anymore (thank god!). Just as cheesy, just as fun, but no sing-along musical numbers. The wife (Tracy Coogan) is the kind of woman every man wants to marry. Sexy, supportive, and loyal enough to (without provocation) punch the [...] out whose arm you are munching on (in public), just to make sure that she doesn't attract a crowd. The acting varies from mediocre to reasonably good, depending on the actor.

This movie has a realism that belies the fact that it is a zombie movie. In the sense that it is entitled ""Zombie Honeymoon,"" that is precisely what it is, despite some previous reviews feeling cheated by the title. It is a  really f'ed up honeymoon: Your new husband is now a zombie and you have to deal with the circumstances and  consequences of his new eating habits, decaying flesh, and what that does to your plans to skip own forever.

 Tracy Coogan really holds the entire movie together, and Graham Sibley as Danny [""Brad"" in my earlier analogy]) is occasionally hilarious as he ever-so-casually gallivants around with his face covered in fresh blood, often munching on various body parts. The make-up is pretty good considering the low budget, and the soundtrack rocks. Both of the lead female characters overtly possess psychic powers, which seems to be an allegory for something that escapes me due to my limited mental acuity, but who cares anyway? Psychic chicks are hot. In the final analysis I came away with this realization: Loyal women are by far the best, and the biggest problem with having a zombie husband is that it really screws up your relationships with your friends. Stay for the ending. True love does exist in zombie movies after all.",1179014400,3,2273,4.679197994987469
2468303,2,B000CPH9UM,"Zombie Honeymoon (Dave Gebroe, 2005)

How great is a movie going to be when the box informs you that, in the movie's opening scene, a newlywed couple head for the Jersey shore to begin their honeymoon? You see that and, unless you're from New Jersey (I guess), you assume you're going to get stupid slapstick that can either be brilliant (viz. Return of the Living Dead) or worthless (viz. anything Troma made after Surf Nazis Must Die). And the movie starts off looking like it's going to head in that direction (with, of course, a bit of gratuitous nudity; after all, this is a honeymoon). It's dumb, but it's funny. Then, however, the movie takes a turn down a very dark side street just when you expect it to hit the real heights of hilarity. A zombie stumbles out of the waves while the happy couple are lazing on the beach, and vomits a sticky black goo all over Danny (Love Thy Neighbor's Graham Sidley), the groom. Needless to say, this turns him into one of the living dead, and we can prepare ourselves for all sorts of silly jokes about marriage and living death. But, um... no. Suddenly the film decides it wants to be a bleak, ugly allegory for addiction, as Denise (Six Tulips's Tracy Coogan), the bride, tries to adjust to, well, life with a husband who has to consume flesh to survive. And as a parable of addiction and its fallout, Gebroe (who also wrote the screenplay) has come up with a brilliantly nuanced script. If it had been played straight throughout, I'd probably be calling this one of the great underrated movies of our time, a fantastic new take on The Man with the Golden Arm. Except that, well, it's not, because it's never sure it wants to be that movie instead of the genre slapstick it starts out as.

This is even more depressing because for a microbudget indie horror flick, it's practically Oscar material. Sibley doesn't really have to do much after the first half hour but growl and go after cute travel agents, but come the last half-hour of the movie. Coogan shines more brightly than any actor I can remember seeing in a recent microbudget (save Dennis Hopper in House of 9, but hey, that's Dennis Hopper). Tonya Cornelisse and David Wallace, as friends of the couple, and Neal Jones, as a cop who's suspicious of the mysterious disappearances surrounding Danny, are more than competent (compare Jones to Joey Lawrence in Rest Stop and you'll see where I'm coming from here). And while no one's going to be confusing Dave Gebroe for David Lean any time soon, this is good, solid work for a second movie.

The film also has a good flow from start to finish.

There is no real `hardcore' zombie action, but if you're a fan of zombies or a completist of the undead genre, then this is a fun afternoon flick to throw on while you're doing housework or homework.

It isn't anything like a George A Romero zombie flick, ok so that's fine, but it neither scary nor thought provoking as the guy who gave it 5 stars. He knows the director and therefore is doing some SERIOUS brown nosing. TRUST ME, next to Day of the Dead 2:Contagium, this is the WORST zombie movie of all time. there is nothing redeemable about this. I give it 2 stars for 1 simple reason, the make out scenes in the beginning are hot, especially when he pulls off her panties.

2468312,5,B000CPH9UM,"Zombie Honeymoon is certainly not what I expected.  We fans of the zombie genre really can not be sure what we're getting by looking at a cover.  As one reviewer suggested, the packaging makes ZH appear to be a troma-esqe zombedy that will provide a few laughs and fit nicely between `Rabid Grannies' and `Redneck Zombies'.  What we get here is very different.

This is not a post apocalyptic quest for survival set to a backdrop of hordes of flesh-hungry monsters.  There are only two zombies in the entire movie, and one is only seen for about 30 seconds.  Zombie Honeymoon is much more about the trials and tribulations of true love.

We watch a couple go through the heartbreak of attempting to deal with her beloved husband's `affliction'.  At one point, we even see him rationalizing that he is not a bad person.  Wife Tracy Coogan is extremely convincing in her internal struggle to be there for husband, till death do them part.  If there is any justice in filmmaking, Coogan will be seen again, she is excellent.  Husband is (while not nearly as convincing) pretty adept to showing his internal struggle between not wanting to kill people and his need to feed his `addiction'.

15 hours after watching the movie, I am still affected.  It was a powerful love story.  Zombie Honeymoon is considerably more depressing than any other movie with the word `zombie' in the title.  I would absolutely recommend it, especially if the girlfriend will be watching too.  Just make sure to keep a copy of `Shaun of the Dead' handy as an antidote for post `Zombie Honeymoon' depression.

It's a zombie movie that makes you THINK, and it's also one of the more potent meditations on marriage and commitment ever put to film.  Take that title with a grain of salt.  I know it SOUNDS like a bad, Troma-esque flick, but believe me when I tell you, this movie is as emotionally engaging as it gets.

There are too many long, overly monotonous scenes that wind up going nowhere; it seems that Gebroe may have been a little too close to, or in love with, his material.

2468327,5,B000CPH9UM,"Fans of zombie cinema are no strangers to wading through loads of dreck to find the gems. Rest assured, Zombie Honeymoon is one of those gems. Unlike far too many horror movies out there, this independent work of art by Dave Gebroe delivers high levels of blood & gore _without_ sacrificing creepiness, infuses its characters with coolness and humor _without_ sacrificing character depth, and is emotionally charged _without_ sacrificing style.

The concept, at its core, is a tragic love story. There are a number of jokes -- good jokes, pitch-black and subtle -- and they are often delivered nonintrusively when the tension is highest. But even more important is the romantic element, which, in Gebroe's capable hands, provides a bizarrely appropriate structure for a story full of some very palpable horror. Gorehounds and horror enthusiasts will certainly be delighted, but I expect non-horror fans to enjoy this film, as well.

The story follows newlyweds Denise and Danny -- portrayed excellently by Tracy Coogan and Graham Sibley -- on their honeymoon, which is interrupted when Danny is attacked by a mysterious zombie-like fellow. After Danny dies and inexplicably revives, he starts to feel new cravings... for human flesh. As Denise finds out, planning for the future, handling the tasks of the moment, and maintaining ties to the past all become much trickier when one is married to an anthropophagous ghoul.

Many viewers will be able to connect with Zombie Honeymoon at different levels. The main characters are likeable and realistically portrayed, so their trials seem that much more sympathetic. People who have suffered the loss of a loved one may be able to relate to Denise's situation and empathize with her distress, and people who have had to deal with addiction or disease in themselves or those close to them may notice multiple parallels.

I'm not kidding. It's a blood-spattered zombie movie, and it's probably the most _moving_ blood-spattered zombie movie you'll see for some time.

I caught Zombie Honeymoon during one of its limited theatrical runs, and I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. This DVD will definitely be worth owning. A solid assortment of special features has been announced, including two commentaries (one with the writer / director / producer himself, and another with the lead actors), two behind-the-scenes documentaries, and others.

8100025,4,B000CPH9UM,"Zombie Honeymoon
 We have funny zombie flicks, scary Zombie flicks and plenty of really ill produced just plain not good zombie flicks.  We have very few serious, heart breaking and brutily honest Zombie filcks.  Here we have the humerously titled ""Zombie Honeymoon"" in a decidedly not humorous film.
 How deep is your love?  The song line comes to life here.  To what extent do you stick with your spouse.  Until death do you part?  Or well beyond death?  Well, the new bride (Tracy Coogan) opts to stick with her husband (Grahm Sibley) even after he has turned Zombie.  Do not think of this as a warm love story like the recent ""Warm Bodies"".  Grim does not go far enough.  Harrowing comes closer to a proper discription.
 The two leading players are both genuine actors.  Grahm Sibley in particular has a long list on his sheet.  He might not be a household word but he is a solid pro.  Less successful, Tracy Coogan also has a shorter list of credits but both are working today in 2015.
  Writer/Director/Producer David Gebroe also can claim to be a genuine film professional.  He has made a worthwhile Zombie film, one that fans should see.
 I can not say that this one is fun to watch.  The gore, while plentiful, does not cross the line into spoof.  Most horrible is the sickness the husband expieriences after eating human flesh---and the care and concern exibited by the wife.  This film had a low budget but high talent level.  The production values are high enough for the film to be judged on its movie merits rather than by a special low level just for Zombie films.
 This film should be rated ""R"" for sex and gore.  It runs for one hour and 23 minutes.  I give it a superior three and a half brains.",1449705600,,1713,4.495114006514658
8100026,3,B000CPH9UM,"I had been curious about this movie for quite a while. I always enjoy a decent zombie flick but it seems these days zombie flicks are a dime a dozen what with the small independent film makers flooding the market of the undead. I watched this movie to see how romance could be woven into the plot of a zombie movie. Well, the results are mixed indeed. I came away from this movie actually feeling a little sad. I'd say that the couple of actors pulled off the improbable by making their love seem real and palpable. In the end I felt just a little sad. This being said although  I felt a little sad at the end of the movie I didn't exactly enjoy my journey to that feeling of sadness.

What I didn't care for a lot were the low production values of the movie or so much for the zany introduction of the characters. We meet the loving couple as they run out of the church to their car. Soon we are listening to some band listed in the credits as the photon torpedoes. The band plays what must be some sort of punk rock music. Cutting to the chase the couple is in love, and they make love and act silly like a newly married couple. The husband is sleeping on the beach next to his new wife when some zombie guy walks out of the ocean, jumps on the new husband and spits green or black ooze out of his mouth and into the husband's mouth. The zombie then dies on top of the husband. The couple rush to the hospital where the husband actually dies for ten minutes. The husband is pronounced dead but then comes back to life. From here on out the husband acquires a taste for the living. First the husband eats a guy from the hospital, then a jogger later a travel agent and then a long list of other people.

The husband cannot control his appetite but the wife who loves him sticks by his side. The husband starts to literally rot and before long he is looking pretty gross. Seeing that the husband has very little time left the wife sets the table for their one and only honeymoon candle lit dinner.

And now that I am thinking back I can't exactly remember how the zombie husband actually died. Hubby was shot several times by police before he started eating them which of course killed them.

At the end of the movie we see the sad wife thinking back about her husband. I found the sadness believable and so this movie really succeeds on many levels. The acting rises above the lower production and budget value. The movie works but it wasn't exactly an enjoyable viewing experience for this movie watcher. I guess your enjoyment of the movie might depend upon how much you enjoy watching sad romance movies.

Mostly what I found to be a turnoff was the combination of a love story splashed with so much red blood. The actual gore in the movie is not that pronounced but just seeing the husband with blood all over his mouth and down his neck and all over his arms was enough to turn me off. I just don't think this combination of love and blood and zombieism makes for a very enjoyable movie. Viewing results will vary of course but I don't know right now when I might want to watch this movie again. I think I'll remember it though.

Also, throughout the movie I watched the wife closely because she looked so much like a girl I knew from work. The girl I knew was a little shorter and had bigger boobs and she probably wasn't as attractive but she sure reminded me of the girl I knew which made the movie experience a little different for me.

Oh, and I just remember how the movie ended. The husband had the wife cornered in the house. He got up on top of her and just when you though he was going to ooze his sputum into her mouth he turned his head. So in the end he didn't turn his wife into a zombie. I guess LOVE persuaded this husband zombie not to turn his wife. The husband then promptly died.

All in all this movie experience was a bit on the dreadful side.",1373155200,,3871,4.234417344173441

Infection kicks in and Danny is quickly taken to the hospital and dies. The end.

But wait, there's more! Instead of watching Denise go through years of suffering, therapy, or depression we get to see her spirits lighten as only 30 seconds after Danny's death he comes back to life! A few tests later and they are able to leave the hospital (... yes I know if I ever die and come back to life the first thing the hospital is going to do is let me out the same day.) Also (again seeminly believable) is when they get home Denise leaves her recently deceased husband to go and get some groceries for the night.

Again, I don't know about you but if I died and came back I'm pretty sure the woman would order pizza at the most and be staying with me the entire time. Fortunately though her departure gives Danny enough time to beat down a jogger which he throws into the bathtub to feast upon. Yes ladies and gentlemen when things come back from the dead they eat the living. It's just something that happens.

When Denise stumbles upon him chewing in his dinner saying she's not too pleased is an understatement. She freaks out and as they work through it they find out that he actually did die. In order to keep on his charming good wit (and not fall apart) he has to continue eating living flesh and is unable to prevent himself whenever the urge arises.

It's a story about zombies, but more importantly it's a story about accepting the small differences between you and the person you're in love with. It's about moving past them and building your life together.

Now I can't say I can recommend this zombie film as a BUY but I would say it's one worth watching at least once to see how intelligent zombies can make any movie work extremely different from it's usual plot. Just keep telling yourself, everything is better with zombies and you'll be OK!

No masses of a town full of zombies, just this one man and his bride as he slowly makes the change and she wavers between keeping her vows to the man she loves or fleeing for her life.

Like in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles the movie shows the metamorphosis to be slow, as your body changes and rejects ordinary food, etc.

Even better was watching the extras to show how the story came from a real-life couple, friends of the filmmakers, only her husband actually died on their honeymoon. :( This bride gets to slowly lose her husband. Great actors, and a great job for a 'B' budget film.

But in this case, the guy's problem is that he's a flesh-eating zombie.  Fortunately, the director plays it as a straight love story and as a result, you get black humor at its best.  Never played for laughs, the absurdity of the various situations makes it hilarious.  This guy doesn't sneak off for a hit or a drink, he unexpectedly grabs someone, anytime, anywhere and takes a big bite out of their arm or neck, or as in one scene, he grabs a cop by the ears and bites his big snooping nose off.

8100032,4,B000CPH9UM,"Here we stand at October 26, 2009 with the 26th review of Sid's October HorrorGreatSuccess. This is the first time we've been introduced to a new genre we'd like to tag as Zombie Romance. Have to say the idea is something we would never attempt to conjure up but figured it only be fair to give it a shot. Our Octoberfest is all about getting in some classics along with as many different genres as we possibly can, which is why Zombie Honeymoon has made it. It is by far one of the more original spins the walking dead have ever seen making us wonder what other possibilities are out there. Why not go the horror route to a Death Ring sequel? Now obviously you're saying ""wait Sid, Vachs was decapitated so how could their be a sequel?"" Well you just answered your own question. Bringing back Vachs as a headless zombie would be a perfect twist that surely would get Chad, Don, and Mike to sign up for round 2. But we digress and get back to the realization we have to finish this review.

Zombie Honeymoon starts off with a recently married couple who've set off to enjoy their honeymoon. One day they decide to hit the beach where the husband is attacked by a zombie who throws up in his mouth. Yeah it's as nasty as it sounds. After a couple minutes he dies and is rushed to the hospital by his old lady. Once there his comes back to life and nobody can figure out why. Well if you can't guess, it's because he's now a zombie. He's not the slow moving type that says brains every few seconds though. He's fully functional just picking up a strong desire for human flesh and shows this by eating a fat guy jogging through the neighborhood. He slowly begins to turn more zombie-ish as the day's go on leaving his wife in misery as she tries to cope with the big change. Man no wonder the divorce rate is so high. This one is very original and actually a really decent flick. It's a bit more sad then actually scary so Sid's not going to recommend it to just anyone. For certain people this one's good stuff, but to the typical zombie lovers it will probably be shunned.",1256515200,,2071,4.31025641025641
8100033,4,B000CPH9UM,"Professional critical reviews of this film (which sit at an 80% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes of this writing) primarily praise the acting of actress Tracy Coogan (as Denise) and the writing of director Dave Gebroe: particularly his humor. I myself was most impressed with the heart in both, and unsurprisingly. Gebroe was inspired to write this film by two things: first, when he was a young child, his mother took him and his sister Denise to see Lucio Fulci's Zombie, and even at eight Gebroe was awed by the impact it had on its audience; second, his younger sister Denise quite suddenly lost her husband Danny in a surfing accident within a few years of their marriage. The movie has its humor and its typical gross action, but it is at its core a character study, what the director described to Hollywood Gothique as a ""valentine"" to his sister's strength.

I liked it, quite a lot. Will you?

If you like wall-to-wall slamming action in your horror films, probably not. There are payoffs for fans of the gross, but they are widely spaced at the beginning, though as the film gathers speed you may well find some satisfaction.

If you can overlook cheap production values (kudos to the director for making the best of what he had) and if you can allow the story to build, then you just might. What you get out of a horror film depends on what you bring to it. People who want to shut off their empathy and feel nothing for the characters on screen, but simply root on heroes (or villains) in some cleverly twisted battle between good and evil may not find this to their tastes. Those willing to engage with the characters and actors--especially Coogan whose performance _Village Voice_ described as rising to ""almost Streepian commitment""--may just.",1236643200,,1760,4.726384364820847
