8163733,5,B000LQI5LE,"I know these DVDs don't have the flashy covers of other dance DVDs, but they really are good.  I went to my local library and borrowed several of the others available here on Amazon.  Sure they were ok, but I never felt like I would be able to do the dances with confidence.  After purchasing and watching this Lampert DVD, with the way they demonstrate it so clearly, I was able to start right up and feel confident almost immediately!  I know they look old fashion, but the directions are easy to follow and they teach you how to put it in a nice routine.  I also thought that the steps they taught looked good.  I was thrilled to see that they offer intermediate and advanced DVDs, so I can progress through the program. I, for one, am extremely pleased with the Lampert Dance instruction!",1199577600,3,792,4.427586206896552
