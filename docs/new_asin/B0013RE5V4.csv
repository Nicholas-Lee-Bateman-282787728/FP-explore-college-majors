3118896,5,B0013RE5V4,"Purchased this for my wife and her massage therapy practice.  She said this expanded greatly on techniques her school barely touched on.  All in all, she feels this makes her a better CMT, and that's saying something since she's already the best in town.  This DVD set is good for continuing education for established massage therapists, or a great way to help students gain wider knowledge in bodywork.",1364688000,,403,4.897058823529412
3118897,2,B0013RE5V4,"First let me start off by saying that I am a massage therapy student, not one of those ignorant ""massage"" fans that loves to hear their own voice, who will watch these DVD's and say that this is not true Lomi Lomi.  Lomi Lomi has many styles the style taught in these DVD's is just not the kind I, or probably most everyone one else wants to learn.  There are no full length massage runs on any one of these videos.  They teach a style of Lomi Lomi that really isn't that much different from a western ""swedish"" style massage. The first DVD's teaches some interesting techniques that are generally not usually seen in Swedish massage I think it might be profitable to watch the first DVD just so you can pick up some techniques.  The second one focuses on teaching forearm techniques, but after watching Val Guin's ""Forearm dance"" it paled in comparison.  The third DVD was all about massage done in the side lying position.  It was really disappointing.  I have seen much better side lying DVD's.  The best being Ralph Stephen's ""side lying therapeutic massage""  All three DVD's teach a routine that is done with a full sheet drape, that breaks the body into part by part, and un-drapes and re-drapes each body part.  Overall I would say that if you want to find a DVD that teaching full body Lomi Lomi runs check out ""Basic Hawaiian Lomi Lomi Massage"" by Steve Ibach.  I have it and and have watched it 100 times. To supplement it though I think you should buy the Level I DVD from this series so you can learn some Lomi Lomi techniques to use inbetween the full body runs.",1330473600,21,1575,4.452961672473868
3118898,1,B0013RE5V4,"These dvd's DO NOT demonstrate traditional lomi lomi.  These are simply basic regular massage techniques with very little use of the forearms.  I was expecting to see fluid, rhythmic motions using long continuous strokes over the entire body as well as underbody techniques while the therapists moves as if dancing.  Do not waste your time and money on these!",1310169600,11,359,5.0508474576271185
3118899,5,B0013RE5V4,I am a new massage therapist.  I ordered these dvd's so that I could offer something different to my clients.  They LOVE lomi lomi!!  The dvd's are very easy to follow and leave you feeling confident in your new abilities!  The techniques are very easy to incorporate into what you are already doing. Have fun and enjoy.,1308096000,3,320,4.56140350877193

8252742,5,B0013RE5V4,This takes a lot of my time to write all this so that the word count is sufficient when all I want to say is that they sent the item and I am satisfied. They need to change this because this is why most people won't take the time to even say they got the item. WAKE up AMAZON!,1395964800,,276,3.694915254237288
