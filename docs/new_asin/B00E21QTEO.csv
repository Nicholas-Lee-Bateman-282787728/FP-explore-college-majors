5886542,3,B00E21QTEO,"I love Tiger & Bunny, but I knew that half of this movie was going to be recap so I decided to simply rent it from Amazon instead of buying it. It was definitely worth the rent but not really worth owning, in my opinion, unless you don't mind the recap. The recap portion (basically episodes 1-2 of the series) was done well and added some new scenes in (including some about Kotetsu and Tomoe, his wife), which was nice. The new story takes place right after the incident at the skating rink in episode 2 so it's very early on in the series, and Tiger and Barnaby are still learning to work together. Basically, there's a new bad guy with interesting NEXT powers, and you get to see how the heroes handle it. It feels like just watching another episode or so of the series, which is fine, I just wish they'd been able to make the whole movie with new content instead of half of it being a rehash. That's what the next movie, Tiger & Bunny: The Rising, is for though (all new content and quite good!)",1394841600,12,1000,4.268421052631579
5886543,5,B00E21QTEO,"This series is the best! I was so excited that I found this on Amazon. I was very happy with the punctuality of the shipping too. Showed up right on time. If you love mechs, anime, and superheroes then you should totally look into this!! 5 stars!",1392854400,,246,4.25531914893617
5886544,5,B00E21QTEO,"Arrived in a timely manner (right before Christmas) in good condition. If you've read the manga, it stays very true to the story. I enjoyed the new soundtrack! Thanks and thanks again! =^^=",1389484800,,189,4.757575757575758
5886545,5,B00E21QTEO,This videos is for lessons learned from the past. The drawing was colorful. The plot is good for young kids to watch and learn.,1388188800,,127,4.333333333333333
5886546,3,B00E21QTEO,"About half of the movie is just straight footage from the 1st episode of the series, with small bits of new content interspersed.  I was very much looking forward to a prequel-type movie, but instead just got a rehash of the first episode with about half new content.  Still the same excellent quality of writing and animation, but felt like cheating to re-sell the same episode again as something else.",1384732800,,403,4.742857142857143
5886547,4,B00E21QTEO,I didn't know it was going to have the first few episodes with deleted  scenes. Over all it was a good movie.,1383782400,,109,3.9545454545454546
5886548,5,B00E21QTEO,"<3 I am a major Tiger and bunny fan so this gives and inside look inside the lives of the super hero duo. Starting from the beginning of the anime with a few different perspectives then to a new plot added in.
FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MOVIE IS...

This movie is the inbetween point when Kotetsu and Barnaby were first starting out as partners. Before they met Jake when their friendship and partnership was still beginning.

Its a great movie and I would recommend it to almost anyone <3",1382572800,,497,4.391304347826087
5886549,4,B00E21QTEO,"I was an idiot and didn't do my research. I thought this was the next Tiger & Bunny movie: The Rising. But it's actually a recap movie, with a couple new scenes. I still had a good time rewatching familiar scenes, and the added clips are really fun!",1382313600,,249,4.208333333333333
5886550,5,B00E21QTEO,"Great movie if you're a fan of the series. The first half of the film recaps the first two episodes of the series, while also introducing a new story. The blu ray quality is great, definitely worth buying if you like the anime.",1380499200,5,227,4.3023255813953485
8600304,4,B00E21QTEO,Not a standalone movie like how I originally thought. The animation looked good and it was nice to see a bit more of Tiger & Bunny. I just wish I could have just watched it with subs since that's how I watched the anime. The English voice cast did a good job though,1524873600,,265,4.018867924528302

8600306,5,B00E21QTEO,I like the it combines first two episodes with extra scenes. It also filling some characters hole that I wondered about while watching the series. Like what was Rock Bison's Power?! Now I know. XD,1434758400,,196,4.628571428571429

8600308,5,B00E21QTEO,"Tiger and Bunny has to be one of my top anime of all time. It's one of the few anime that I actually purchased instead of just watching it on line. The characters are vast and have great depth. I also love the super hero genre and they turned it into a masterpiece. The only downfall is that it sets up for at least another season, but hopefully the latest movie will wrap up the series.  The idea that they get paid to be heroes and earn points makes the idea more realistic than mysterious disappearing at work and ever getting fired.",1425081600,,536,4.254901960784314
8600309,3,B00E21QTEO,"This review is of the DVD.  I already love the series and will pimp it out like crazy at any point.  And if you like the show, superheroes, warm friendships, and good writing, you should buy this DVD anyway to prove that we will buy good things, dagnabbit!  That said, these DVDs are some of the most terrible releases outside of ADV.  The box is cheap.  The print is spotty on the disc and the insert.  No inside book.  There is one REALLY FABULOUS SPECIAL FEATURE, though, and that is almost worth it alone.",1424563200,,509,4.351063829787234

8600312,5,B00E21QTEO,"Just  finished watching ""Tiger & Bunny - The Movie - The Beginning"" released by VIZ Media.
""Tiger & Bunny"" is an interesting take on what it means to be a superhero and why people become one.  For Barnaby Brooks Jr., he wants to become a part of the superheros that make up the popular reality television crime show HERO TV in order to track down who murder his parents.  Here's where the Batman similiarities end.
Wild Tiger, an aging veteran of HERO TV, in his civilian identity of Kotetsu T. Kaburagi, who is way past his peak.  He has a family to support - his daughter unaware that he is Wild Tiger.
In order to boost ratings, Kaburagi is ordered by the network to be Brooks' sidekick.  Naturally, that doesn't sit well with both men.
""What I liked about ""Tiger & Bunny - The Movie - The Beginning"" is that while both Brooks and Kaburagi are heroes for entirely different reasons; they make realistic mistakes on the way to becomming a functioning crime fighting duo - even if they don't really like each other.
I will be definately dropping hints to Minions #1 & #2 that the complete series of Tiger & Bunny would be a most excellent Channukah gift...;)
Strongly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1411862400,,1193,4.55607476635514
8600313,4,B00E21QTEO,It is a great recap of the series with some differences here and there. Can't wait until The Rising comes out!,1409702400,,110,4.285714285714286
