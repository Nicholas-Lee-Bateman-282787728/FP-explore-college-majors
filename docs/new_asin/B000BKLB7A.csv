2422836,5,B000BKLB7A,"When I purchased this dvd, I was afraid that it would be too ""young"" for me tailored more towards young children.  It shows the basic steps and way beyond.  I am very pleased with it!",1141084800,8,183,4.2
2422837,5,B000BKLB7A,This dvd was excellent because it very simply both clearly explained and clearly demonstrated the moves. I was able to apply the moves immediately.,1140739200,8,147,5.166666666666667
2422838,5,B000BKLB7A,"I must say that i LEARNED how to Tap Dance with Germaine Salsberg ! Granted , it was from a DVD, not a class, but nonetheless her instruction is clear and concise. Even for someone like myself who has never had a professional dance class, I was able to pick up the steps and exercises as Germaine really does break down the steps along with the counts. She has a pleasant voice, warm personality and a nice sense of humor. She talks briefly about the importance of rhythm and how one steps develops into another. Whats nice about this information is that she explains it all AS she is teaching, and no time is wasted on idle chit chat. Its also easy to learn as she turns away from the camera when she teaches each step. I started out following along with my hard soled shoes, but eventually purchased a pair of tap shoes as i wanted to HEAR my results. The tape is jam packed with information and I still have several steps to master yet. Highly recommended-Go Germaine !!!",1132704000,44,974,4.386740331491713

8088065,4,B000BKLB7A,"As someone with modest but not recent experience with tap dancing, this video was appropriately geared to my level of experience.",1451692800,,129,5.190476190476191
8088066,5,B000BKLB7A,"Love my tap dancing tapes, great exercise.",1424563200,,42,5.142857142857143
8088067,5,B000BKLB7A,"The presentation is outstanding and I believe  an excellent DVD for beginners as well as intermediate dancers. I have been taking tap lessons for a year, and although I can navigate myself around the dance floor with some proficiency, I still consider myself a beginner. Germaine is extremely animated and takes you through each step and routine at a pace and level that is easy to follow and understand.",1405728000,,404,4.855072463768116
8088068,5,B000BKLB7A,The DVD is excellent!  I'm just doing this for fun but I really feel like I'm learning a lot and getting better every time I watch it and tap along.  I recommend it for any beginner.,1393459200,,182,4.027777777777778
8088069,3,B000BKLB7A,She is very easy to relate to and breaks down the components of each step/section in a nice way.  Good basics...,1361145600,,112,4.333333333333333
8088070,4,B000BKLB7A,I had seen some country clogg dancing and thought it was wounderful.  So I decided to start my self.  Very good dvd to get you stared with the basics.,1333152000,,150,4.137931034482759
8088071,1,B000BKLB7A,Don't waste your money on this one. Her style is grotesque. No really good demos. Not a lot of content for the money.,1265155200,2,117,4.130434782608695
8088072,5,B000BKLB7A,Simply Tap is a great introduction to tap dancing. Germaine Salsberg is a great teacher. She starts with the basics and works up to a time step. She explains everything clearly and starts out slowly and works up to a faster tempo. She has a great personality and makes tap dancing fun. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the basics.,1174521600,6,341,4.428571428571429
8088073,1,B000BKLB7A,"I am an absolute beginner to tapping, and found the dvd not suitable at all.

Germaine Salzburg launches into a rapid progression of steps and after 5 minutes, says, OK now lets do them quicker.  You are not given the opportunity to practice.  Her approach feels condescending and shallow, (at one stage she makes a mistake in her instructions for a step, but didn't even bother to reshoot the piece.)

I felt totally overwhelmed when trying to follow and gave up.

It feels like she tries to hurry through the basics at top speed without showing you properly how to do the basics.

I felt totally out of my depth and exactly how I felt when attending a public tap class where I was the only beginner.

Thankfully I bought ""I hate to exercise, I love to Tap.""  If you are an absolute beginner and are rythm challenged then try that instead.  Once you have worked through that DVD you can then move onto this one.",1157414400,32,912,4.445783132530121
