The title screen is beautiful and it has my favorite performance that Gorillaz has ever done on it. This was the best investment i have made with my money in a long time.",1445904000,,250,3.9215686274509802
8504809,3,B006UUL5OO,"For some reason the dvd I got in the mail has Spanish explanations for the songs & dvd information. Not sure if that's because I got a bootleg version of it or if that's the way it was released? The sound quality is also off.

All in all not bad for the money.",1357257600,,389,3.9367088607594938
