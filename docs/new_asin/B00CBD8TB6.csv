8579686,5,B00CBD8TB6,"Claudette Colbert was one of the most versatile stars of the 1930s, effortlessly switching her talents between comedy and drama. But comedy was her forte and this movie along with ""Midnight"" {1939}, ""It Happened One Night ""{1934} and ""Tovarich"" {1937} is {in my opinion} the best of her many comedic movies/roles. In an unusual twist the eternal triangle becomes a QUADRANGEL with three guys in hot pursuit of her.

Playing a hardworking single gal taking a long overdue three {3} week holiday she attracts the attentions of a feckless playboy {Robert Young}, a home town boy {Lee Bowman and a playwright {Melvyn Douglas}. All of them have their attractions for her but if you know anything about movies of the 30s and 40s two {2} of these guys are perpetual losers in getting the girl at the final clinch.

All the performances are consistently excellent but this is Ms. Colbert's movie lock, stock and barrell !!. She is feminine without being coy, wise but not ""all knowing"" and handles her dialogue {and the guys} with equal portions of amused tolerance and asperity - a brilliant performance!

The comedic highlight of the film is the skiing trip to the French Alps {with California's Sun Valley an excellent stand-in} - a really funny sequence with all the men falling, tripping and floundering while Claudette {an excellent skier} just naturally floats around them.

Though unknown today, Paramount's top writer/director team of Claude Binyon and Wesley Ruggles scripted many of Paramount's ""A Class"" comedies but this one is by far their best effort, a smooth, slick, bright film with a glow and charm that showcase its cast - especially Ms. Colbert perfectly.

This is a really excellent film that deserves to be better known and I give it a 5 star rating - Highly recommended.",1441929600,4,1786,4.920265780730897
8579687,3,B00CBD8TB6,Two men meet up with an American woman in Paris. They both seem interested in her but approach romance in different ways. This movie is really nothing more than their competition over her really. Nothing special. Nothing unique. It is not really one of my favorite Colbert movies although two of her films are my favorites. I'll leave it at that.,1439769600,,346,4.688524590163935

8579690,5,B00CBD8TB6,"This is a typical Claudette Colbert movie. Its fun and romantic. A story of a love triangle. He loves her, she loves him and he loves her. Does she pick the right guy or doesn't she? You will just have to buy the movie to find out. I really had fun with this movie and didn't see a certain plot within the plot happening until it was in my face.",1389830400,,345,3.942857142857143
