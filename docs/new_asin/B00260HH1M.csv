3850382,5,B00260HH1M,The Pink Panther II rocks!!! I think some of the original Pink Panther movies were too slow paced and boring.  Even the 2006 Pink Panther I movie was dull in comparison with the Pink Panther II.  The Pink Panther II This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  My 10-year-old daughter loves it as well.  We've seen it multiple times.  It is a masterpiece if you love a good comedy film like I do.  I especially enjoy the character of the lady whose job it was to make the inspector act in a manner that is more politically correct.  I recommend this movie for all who want a good series of belly laughs!,1245628800,2,603,4.283185840707965
3850383,1,B00260HH1M,"The cast: Jeremy Irons, Alfred Molina, Jean Reno, John Cleese, Steve Martin. ALL GOOD ACTORS. Steve Martin is a brilliant guy. The Jerk was/is a hilarious film. Roxanne is a smart/funny movie.

So WHY is this piece of cinema torture so bad? It looks like everybody was getting paid, but no one cared about the work. Its not funny, none of it. One stupid pratfall after another followed by some lame jokes, ugh...

Do yourself a favor, skip this cinematic water-boarding.",1245542400,4,470,4.790123456790123
3850384,4,B00260HH1M,"I don't think I've ever watched a film that was so bad during which I laughed so much.  I am not fan of Steve Martin in general, and his accent here was particularly poor.  There is too much slapstick, much of which isn't integrated into the film.  The Lily Tomlin character serves no real purpose.  The plot meanders.  Yet, in spite of all its flaws, Pink Panther 2 is one funny film.",1241913600,9,385,4.291666666666667
3850385,3,B00260HH1M,"The greatest part of ""The Pink Panther 2"" is its opening credit sequence. No, I'm not talking about its cartoon and Henry Mancini song. I am talking about the cast. Where else can you see such players in one film as Steve Martin, Jean Reno, Emily Mortimer, Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, Lily Tomlin, Jeremy Irons, John Cleese and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan? Wait, it that Johnny Hallyday?

So what about the film itself? Well, it is not as bad as some people say and it is not great, either. The story about a notorious thief stealing the historical artifacts and an international team of the world's most capable detectives (led by the most incompetent one Inspector Jacques Clouseau) is just predictable. The jokes including many physical gags are hit and miss - mostly miss, I am afraid, not because of the cast, but because of the weak direction and stale ideas. Stupid things happen, which you think could be stupider with someone more capable.

Steve Martin is game as Clouseau. So is John Cleese (replacing Kevin Kline) as delightfully pompous Dreyfus. The sequel, it seems, gives Martin more chances to do physical gags as the bumbling inspector who has a curious knack for doing the wrong thing at the wrong moment. It is also good to see him and the entire cast obviously having fun even though the film wastes the capable supports like Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, refusing to give them chances to really shine.

But I didn't hate the film. Actually I enjoyed watching it, knowing that it lacks inspiration and imagination. Yes, I know the film misses every opportunity to make its joke a better (or funnier) one. Perhaps they shouldn't have re-used some of the old jokes (like ""hamburger""); perhaps they should have abandoned the idea of Clouseau's romance and teaching him political correctness. Or perhaps the film's jokes look too old-fashioned...or recycled.",1241654400,,1892,4.90625

3850406,1,B00260HH1M,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Uniformly bad. I can't believe anyone thought this movie was funny. I am shocked by the number of glowing reviews. Were we watching the same film?

The stellar cast of Steve Martin (who I usually love), Alfred Molina, Jeremy Irons (never actually got to his scenes 'cause I turned the thing off after 30 minutes), Andy Garcia, Jean Reno, Lily Tomlin, and John Cleese seemed like it would have made this a really funny movie. Steve Martin and John Cleese alone-- two comic geniuses-- should have made this movie brilliant. Wow was I wrong!

The screenplay (incredulously, co-written by Martin) is a disjunct piecemeal of poorly conceived and/or cliched lines strung together with no identifiable purpose. The horrendous script *could* have been overcome by the talented cast, but it wasn't: a group of A-list actors going through the motions with no feeling, reciting lines with wooden delivery and vacuous expressions. And the director (don't remember who it was) did nothing to bring out or was incapable of bringing out the considerable abilities of his his actors. What a waste!

The point of a film like this is satire, which, when done right, can be funny. But there was nothing funny about these characterizations. The accents-- even as spoofs-- were just awful. I cringed every time someone opened their mouth. Steve Martin's French accent was particularly and inexcusably bad. Even for a screwball comedy, he was in desperate need of a dialect coach.

Overall, the film just seemed like it was ""trying"" to be funny rather than doing so effortlessly through genuinely funny material. And slapstick and farce are fine, but they need to be well-executed within the structure of a solid piece of filmmaking. None of that here. All style (bad style at that) over substance.

Judging the movie on its own merits, with all comparisons to the original Peter Sellers films aside, it's unfathomable how so many of the right ingredients came together to make such an awful recipe of a movie. How can a movie like this get made? How did no one along the way see how truly bad it was? Someone must have been blinded by dollar signs.

I barely made it to 30 minutes and then had to shut the thing off. I can't remember being so genuinely disappointed in something. Nothing here to latch onto. This film has no redeeming qualities.",1423353600,,2393,4.782082324455206
3850407,2,B00260HH1M,"Okay, let me first say that I'm not comparing the Pink Panther reboots to the original Blake Edwards series from 1963 to 1993, as those movies have an identity all their own. I'm also not comparing Steve Martin to Peter Sellers. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, it's time to talk a bit about this movie. To me, this movie lacked any real substance, as it became apparent that the goal was slapstick gags that really didn't amuse me (and I consider myself fairly easily amused). Steve Martin did what he could with what was given, which wasn't much. This movie is simply unfocused and overindulgent. However, I respect the fact that the two recent Panther films are a reboot of the series, rather than a remake. Could you imagine if there was a remake of The Pink Panther Strikes Again? A Shot in the Dark? The Pink Panther? Return of the Pink Panther? It's good that there was no tampering with those classics. To sum up, steer clear of this second installment of the rebooted series. This movie came into existence only because of a curious audience from the first movie, which was just as bad.",1423008000,,1104,4.525

You get all the fake accents, over (and under) acting, cheesy and awkward caracaturization of anything remotely Peter Sellers, and just plain bad writing.  That and he seems to act oddly feminine, which is beyond me as to why Martin took that angle. There is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever. Steve Martin has crapped on yet another great franchise.  My review of his earlier version of Pink Panther says it all...save your money unless you want to use this disk for a coaster.  Along with #1, I would suggest you take this disk out for use as a target or as a substitute for a clay pigeon at the trap range.

If you really enjoy this film, my guess is your IQ falls well below the 70-80 range.  Not to say that's bad, but when I say that, I keep in mind that statistically, half the people in the world are below average, so somebody's gonna say good things about this movie. Keep that in mind when you read reviews. I'm not a movie snob...I'd rather watch Rescue from Gilligan's Island over this piece of garbage...and find a lot more about that as funny.

3850444,5,B00260HH1M,"I agree with many of the comments in the four star reviews. There's a problem with humor, and that is most people consider their opinions absolute. They aren't. What's funny to a brilliant 30 year old is not the same as what's amusing to a sub-normal 5 year old. Different types of people, different humor: There is no absolute standard.

Lower ratings here compare Martin to Peter Sellars, in the sense that Sellars did a perfect job -- that any performance needs to match his. That's really quite beside the point. What's happening is Sellars created a character that, like Sherlock Holmes, appears to have staying power. Martin demonstrated the potential. Someone else will need to be very, very good indeed to create a plausible alternative to what Martin's created.

He and John Cleese are better than the originals. The orginals were Keystone Cops: superficial, frenetic. It's amusing that some reviewers in Rotten Tomatoes said Martin and Cleese were just stringing together slapstick moments. Not at all. Martin and Cleese added perspective and continuity. Emphasized the successes and created a reality that was never there in the often tedious originals.

Martin and Cleese are not junior in their profession. They didn't make this movie because they were forced to, but because they had something to say. They succeeded.",1287792000,,1331,5.0963302752293576

3850448,4,B00260HH1M,"Okay, so, full disclosure, I worked on this film. I was a stand-in and photo-double for JC and was kindly given a silent bit with SM in the airport. It was the best working experience of my life. That being said, I still believe that I can look at this film objectively. It's a good film. I have really enjoyed watching it and I've seen it several times. I think it is actually better than the first one. The sight gags work very well. Martin does a good job portraying Clouseau and excels in the expressions and physical mannerisms of the character. The group of actors work well together too. The main thing is there is some hilarious stuff in this movie. Some of the sight gags are very clever and inventive. I liked his going undercover in the restaurant and the scene where he investigates at a manor house. But even enjoyed the more subtle stuff. I think Martin is now getting into his stride with this character and I truly hope we get another installment soon. Invariably, we get the comparisons to the original Pink Panther films and the great Peter Sellers. My feeling on this is that they are two very different things. In fact, the last three installments of the Sellers films are the best. Even then the very last one wasn't as good as the one before it. The first one was terrible mildly amusing in places but very staid, A Shot in the Dark was much better than the first, but not quite the classic that the three last Sellers movies were. The two after Sellers died were just dreadful. I choose, however, not to compare these new Pink Panther films with the old ones because it's like comparing apples and oranges. As a film Pink Panther 2 is very funny.",1266624000,,1669,4.4397394136807815

3850450,2,B00260HH1M,"""Pink Panther 2"" offers a second helping - as if one were needed or wanted - of Steve Martin impersonating Peter Sellars impersonating a Frenchman.  In this sequel to the 2006 original (if a movie based on a 35-year-old franchise can be called original), the inept, bumbling, pratfall-prone Inspector Clouseau has signed on as part of a ""Dream Team"" of international detectives who are hot on the trail of The Tornado, a shadowy crime figure who's been stealing some of the world's most priceless - and heavily guarded - treasures, including the famed Pink Panther diamond.

Obviously an acquired taste, ""PP2"" consists almost entirely of Martin mugging for the camera, while everyone else stands around smirking and rolling their eyes in corny reaction shots.  It's a witless affair, overall, but at least we get to toodle around Paris and Rome some and enjoy the work of Jean Reno, Andy Garcia, Lily Tomlin, Jeremy Irons and John Cleese into the bargain.",1259193600,,955,4.95625

3850454,3,B00260HH1M,"not great.

Better than the first one and the credit for that goes to Steve Martin because the script is not very good.

I'm a big Steve Martin fan and I have been trying to figure out why Martin does not excel in this role. In theory I thought he should. He's smart and funny. What else do you need?

After watching the second one though, I realized what has been bothering me. The essence of Clousseau is that he is totally not self aware. Steve Martin however is very self aware. A large part of his comedy act was a success because we were partners in Martin's self aware approach to bizarre comedy. Martin enjoys being watched, and shines when he is watched, a concept that is alien to the character of Clousseau.

If Martin keeps doing this role, he will keep getting better because he is very smart and he is a very hard worker, but he'll never master it. It takes a different kind of personality to do Clouseau well.",1250467200,,924,4.323699421965318

3850460,4,B00260HH1M,"If you liked Part 1, you should like this 2nd chapter. Some may miss Kevin Kine as Inspector Dreyfuss, but John Cleese fills the role nicely.

It's basically this. National Treasures around the world are being stolen, and Clouseau is called into action. This time he will be working with several detectives. (4 to be exact) Amongst these are Alfred Molina and Andy Garcia. The Pink Panther gets stolen from a museum. So there is one slightly annoying tad of inconsistency here... In Part 1, Clouseau gace the ring back to Xania. (By the way, Xania does not appear in this 2nd chapter.)

It doesn't take long for Clouseau's bumbling ways to annoy the others, but we also have an interesting new development. Andy Garcia is making advances on Nicole (Clouseau's love interest), and to complicate things further, Nicole gets jealous when the woman from India is making advances on Clouseau.

Clouseau bumbles to the point where the others get understandably annoyed. (And as the audience, we may wonder if some of the comedy in Rome was in poor taste.)

Moving on, the others think they  have solved the case. But Clouseau seems to be the only one who knows that things can't be over. And through a number of SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT clues, Inspector Clouseau comes through yet again, and finds the CRUCIAL combination of facts that everyone else has overlooked. This leads to a really interesting exposure of internal problems.

And of course, Dreyfuss tries to weakly take credit when Inspector Clousea comes through: ""Ah...yes...Thank you for carrying out my orders.""

It seems only fair to point out that Ponton (from Part 1) seems to provide a crucial role. He is the ONE NORMAL person in this cast of eccentrics. And he handles his role with well. In an especially well drawn moment, Ponton tells Clouseau that he knows statutes and laws very well. But sometimes he can't see the plainest facts. (That Nicole loves him.)

3850461,4,B00260HH1M,"I was so extremely disappointed with the first Pink Panther. I would give it a 1-star, actually. It just had every opportunity to succeed, and failed at almost every level.

That's why I was shocked to see the release of a Pink Panther 2, and didn't see it in theaters. But I reluctantly rented it, and I was so pleasantly surprised. Pink Panther 2 is better in every way.

Steve Martin is a comic genius, and we finally get to see a little of that shine through in this movie. The cutout scenes between Martin & Lily Tomlin are simply classic.

The acting is fine all around, it has a simplistic but realistic plot, the gags are funnier, and there's even a bit of nuance in this one.

No it's not a perfect movie. But it's more on par with Peter Sellers Pink Panthers, and in the end, it's just a very cute family comedy. I hope to see more of them.",1247529600,,850,4.228395061728395

In this one Clouseau is asked to join the ""Dream Team"", a group of the world's best detectives whose job it is to apprehend The Tornado, a thief who has stolen such important icons as the Shroud of Turin and the pope's ring.
There's lots of slapstick and mayem but it all seems to fit the plot and there are some clever and original gags in PP2.  There's even a bit of romance and, of course, the Pink Panther diamond is still at the center of the story.  Be willing to suspend your disbelief and enjoy a laugh, guffaw, or chuckle while you watch Steve Martin do his stuff.",1246579200,,776,4.301369863013699

This isn't art but does exactly was it was intended for. Its funny and give you a good time and a movie a family can watch

I personally liked the first one better as I think I laughed more but this movie was also funny.  The funniest moments take place while he is searching a huge mansion in Rome.

As for those comparing it Peter Sellers version, well yes Seller had a better French accent (who cares) but was just as bumbling as Steve Martin. The Seller movies weren't  art movies themselves and were just as goofy as today's version.  With Sellers being put into a higher plain of existence these days, it seems that all forms of Sellers work have now been deemed to be masterpiece works which truth be told they arent.  I watched all of the Pink Panther movies as a kid and young adult and while I haven't watched any of them in a long time, I remember liking Alan Arkins version better.  If you watch the original Pink Panther movie with Peter Sellers, he wasn't even the main character.  The main character was played by David Nivens",1246320000,,1216,4.36

It brings tears to my eyes to know these brilliant actors consented to star in this crap of a film! Someone please advise Aishwarya Rai Bachachan that she CANNOT act and is in dire need of acting lessons. She is a mediocre actress and even the word mediocre is too complimentary.

Sure enough, Clouseau has just left the country when the diamond is stolen.

All the thefts are the work of The Tornado, a thief who stopped a string of robberies ten years ago.  Why did he come out of retirement?  Who is he?  And will Clouseau get a clue and solve the case?

Granted, I haven't seen the Steve Martin lead remake since it was in the theaters, but this one just didn't have the same amount of laughs.  Yes, there were funny moments, but I didn't laugh nearly as hard.  The funniest laughs were in the previews.  On the other hand, the sexual humor that turned me off at times in the first movie wasn't nearly as prevalent here.

The plot of the film was completely predictable.  In fact, the sub-plots were predictable, too.  Again, I wouldn't have minded if the laughs had been freer.

The cast is amazing, however.  Steve Martin is broadly funny without being over the top.  The rest of the cast gets a few laughs while making good straight men and women.  It's just the script doesn't give them nearly enough material.

The film has its moments, but it doesn't capture the same comic energy of the first one.",1245715200,,1463,4.60077519379845

In the rebooted series, Steve Martin plays the infamous hero, and this is the second film.  After being inactive for a long time, The Tornado is actively stealing valuable pieces of art from around the world, and Clouseau teams up with other top detectives from around the world to form a special Dream Team taskforce in an effort to capture The Tornado.  As usual, he makes a mess of things, but succeeds anyway.

While the film was generally panned by critics, I actually found that it was quite good, and appreciated the slapstick gags and one-liners that constitute the film.  Some of the funniest parts occur when Clouseau and co meet with the Pope, whose ring has been stolen while he slept, and there are laughs to be had at his expense.  While the film might not tickle the fancy of modern audiences, perhaps it harkens back to older style funnies, and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it, despite some real flaws, including some sexual innuendo, and an irritating woman whose only function is to lecture Clouseau about political correctness.
