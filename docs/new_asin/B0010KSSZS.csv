8238017,5,B0010KSSZS,"I was very happy with this product in every way.  It arrived in new, unopened condition, and even though it was labeled as a Region 5 DVD, it could play on my American DVD player.  I was terrified that the disc would not be playable, but everything went fine.  I'm watching the disc right now! As far as I know, the movie is a recording of Feruza Jumaniyozova's 'Concert of Feruza,' which took place this past year.  There are snippets of the concert on YouTube, but it's an unparalleled advantage to have the actual DVD at home!  Everything is in Uzbek [no English or subtitles], and the songs are just awesome.  I never thought I would ever own a DVD from Uzbekistan!  If you love Central Asian music, this DVD is a must - a jewel.  And who can beat the price of $9.99?",1199059200,,771,4.305555555555555
