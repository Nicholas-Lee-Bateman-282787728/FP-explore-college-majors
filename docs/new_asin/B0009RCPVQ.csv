He makes it a history lesson as in search of the snake that killed Cleopatra(not on this DVD) and other wonderful adventures a must. I wonder why Corwin gets the DVD's when Stevens is the real deal ???? You'll watch this DVD multiple times I bet, its so darn interesting and well done :)",1193443200,,351,4.253731343283582
2313435,5,B0009RCPVQ,"Perfect quality, excellent DVD, just what I was expecting. Although I wish he would hurry up and put out more DVD's! Does anyone know if he has or not? I caught the episode where he wrestles an anaconda on cable TV and have been looking for it all over the net and on DVD but have been unsuccessful!! Any ideas?? I would also like to try get my hands on the episodes where it shows him getting bitten by a Cobra and had to go to hospital as well as getting bitten by some other deadly snake but lives to tell the tale! If anyone knows where I can find more Austin Stevens stuff please let me know!! [..]",1173744000,,603,4.07563025210084
2313436,4,B0009RCPVQ,"If you or your children like reptiles, this is a great show.  Although some scenes are somewhat dramatic, it's very entertaining and best of all, the camerawork, scenery and narration are all top notch.",1168819200,3,202,4.9411764705882355
2313437,5,B0009RCPVQ,"I could sit back and drink beer all day to this DVD! Yeah Boy!! I highly recommend this DVD along with a few brew haaas to compliment it. The cold ones will help tone down all the needless dramatic screenplay he does.  I was a little disappointed he couldn't ID the shed he found, which was from an Eastern DB (you can tell if you put it in slow motion), in the Eastern Diamondback episode.  Who ever said you can't learn and drink at the same time?!",1145059200,4,450,4.160919540229885
2313438,5,B0009RCPVQ,"One is lucky to meet, perhaps, five people at the most in one's lifetime who are TRULY passionate about their work, whose life IS their work. Such is the case of Mr. Austin Stevens and his passion for snakes. And it is this passion that is self-evident in his Snakemaster series, THE captivating spirit for the viewer.

This DVD contains three episodes of the entire Snakemaster season produced by Animal Planet, each documenting a buildup of Mr. Stevens' captures of snakes or reptiles in their native habitat, climaxing at the end with the capture of the biggest and ""baddest"" snake/reptile. For Borneo, it is a 20ft.+ Reticulated Python, a snake capable of eating an adult human being without any problem, in Australia's desert it is the giant Perentie lizard, and in the Florida Panhandle it is an 8ft. long Eastern Diamondback rattlesnake. Mr. Stevens has the innate talent to ""take"" us, the viewer, with him on his adventurous journey as if we were right there with him. Right in our living room, he takes us to places that 98% of us will never have the opportunity to visit, a marvelous gift to us on his part. Breathtakingly filmed, beautifully scored (a la John Barry), and wonderfully narrated -- yes, Mr. Stevens is a superb storyteller -- this DVD is not only an excellent snake documentary, but a superb work of cinematographic art! I only hope that Animal Planet will release the entire Snakemaster series on DVD very, very soon.",1134691200,18,1443,4.795180722891566

8065499,4,B0009RCPVQ,"Although you get the feeling some of the animals were planted...in order to be 'discovered' later. Would you wrestle with a python? People like this guy who do this (& badger dangerous animals in general) are begging for trouble. Fascinating to see, though. Can't deny that.
Who was the guy who got stung by the stingray & died? Steve Irwin? That's what I'm talking about.",1399075200,,372,4.7384615384615385

8065501,5,B0009RCPVQ,"Austin Stevens is provides a wild romp with a few truly touching moments. His love of creatures that most human beings are afraid of, or tolerate at best, shines through!

8065505,5,B0009RCPVQ,"This s a really good movie. If you like reptiles and giant snakes in particular, then this movie is a must have. It follows the Snakeman on his trip to find the largest constrictors on the planet and other than a few cheesy parts, it's very informative and has awesome camera shots of his dealings with South America's many types of reptiles.",1343692800,,342,4.532258064516129
