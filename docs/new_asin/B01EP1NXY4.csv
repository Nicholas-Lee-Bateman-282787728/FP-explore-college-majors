7739269,5,B01EP1NXY4,Great anime I hope they make a second season,1498521600,,44,4.0
7739270,3,B01EP1NXY4,I enjoyed it the animation is good.  To be honest you won't be blown away but I don't think it was complete let down.  I know there is a manga for this but not having read or seen it I can't compare.  I would hope the books are better.,1497052800,,235,3.7551020408163267

7739273,5,B01EP1NXY4,"Great anime, I recommend giving the soundtrack a listen it's really good IMO. Anyway, I thought this anime was easy to rip onto my computer and put it on my Plex server",1492214400,,168,4.28125
7739274,5,B01EP1NXY4,"The ending was confusing, but it was a lot better than I expected. Not that perverted, though, which sucks because that was the reason I wanted it. I liked it pretty well though because the way their magic works reminds me of how I think it would work in my own stories.",1492041600,2,270,4.211538461538462
7739275,5,B01EP1NXY4,This is wonderful adaptation of the manga. It darn near follows the manga to the letter. I read the whole series before watching it. And it was a joy to see the pages come to life in the well made anime.  I definitely recommend it.  However I would still suggest reading the 8 books first before enjoying the anime. But it's not necessary if you chose not to,1490054400,4,358,4.25

7739283,5,B01EP1NXY4,"This anime is amazing, it has every type of anime girl in it, and the MC isn't totally clueless about his harem. plus there is a decent amount of action",1483833600,,152,4.1

7739285,4,B01EP1NXY4,CHAOTIC. IT HAD NO CLEAR STORY LINE. CHARACTERS WERE BORING.,1481328000,,60,5.1
7739286,5,B01EP1NXY4,"This is a harem style anime with some magic thrown in all in a school setting.  The usual stuff is here for that type of show, but the video and voice acting are all top notch. I enjoyed it and hope it gets a second season. Don't remember if it had any nudity in it, there are some situations that hint at adult activity throughout as a person would expect from this type of show.  I thought it was well worth thte price.",1480291200,4,421,4.0602409638554215

7739288,5,B01EP1NXY4,I like this anime. Both artwork and story was good. The voice actor did a good job. I like this English version better then the Japanese version. The reason is that the English version sound better and I do not have to read subtitle.,1479600000,2,233,4.318181818181818
7739289,5,B01EP1NXY4,"Got this the other day and have limited myself to watching three episodes a day. When I read the other comments regarding this series, I totally agree, this is a bad-ass set of programs. They do flow pretty well from one episode to another, from one situation to another, building on each other. Character development is also quite enjoyable to watch and stay up with. Heck even the opening music is enjoyable to listen to especially if you have a decent sound system. Regarding the ""fan service"" that has been mentioned in previous reviews. I don't know if everyone has the same edition, but the one that I just bought with English voice-overs is very tame compared to High School DXD or Motto to Lover. When there is an instance of nakedness (i.e., clothes being removed via an explosion) nothing is actually exposed to the viewing public. Regardless, I totally recommend this title to anyone who enjoys watching anime. Enjoy...",1478649600,24,930,4.81875

7739299,4,B01EP1NXY4,"I enjoyed this series for what it was, which is a lighthearted harem comedy. Kinda predictable as far as plot goes, but there were some pretty hilarious situations thrown in. This series deals with magic and mages, of course all of whom are beautiful girls centered around one (thankfully not oblivious) guy. Great sexual comedy, though with as far as they went, they may as well have given us full nudity (which they don't). They leave this open for a season 2 which seems to be the case with all of these short 12 episode series that Sentai likes to do, so don't expect a full arc for all of the characters. The animation was awesome though, so visually this was stunning (in more ways than one lol). I also liked the english dub, not many overplayed voices that we hear time and again.",1475712000,18,788,4.479166666666667

8759323,5,B01EP1NXY4,"This anime is awesome. I did not like paying almost $60 for it but it was worth it. I love the magic element in Trinity Seven, it's very different from the other anime Blu-Rays I own. Love all the characters and the story keeps things very interesting.
Hoping for a Season 2.",1535500800,,275,4.3076923076923075
8759324,5,B01EP1NXY4,Amazing,1534809600,,7,7.0
8759325,4,B01EP1NXY4,OK,1533772800,,2,2.0
8759326,5,B01EP1NXY4,"Arata Kasuga was once a normal boy, or so he thought. It turns out that the ""normal"" world he was living in was one of his own design after he destroyed the world. With that realization and with the realization that his cousin, Hidiri Kasuga has disappeared along with the old world, he sets out to find answers as to how to bring her back. Along his journey, he will have to work with the Trinity Seven, seven girls with the power to help him in his quest to save Hidiri from his own power.

Arata, the main character, unlike many harem protagonists, is novel in character. He's surrounded by competent and bad ass girls, but he's not the least bit flustered or embarrassed or apologetic about the attention he gets from them. When in compromising situations with them, he's cool as a cucumber, not a stuttering mess. He also sticks to his guns, even in tough situations. He knows his priorities and he knows when to be serious when he needs to be.

The story is simple, nothing new as far as storytelling goes, but as I've probably already gotten across, it's the characters that keep this thing going. I don't recall a single character that I actively disliked in any capacity. Aside from a few characters that didn't get enough screen time, all the characters are given plenty to do, making them all integral to the overall plot.

Once you're done with this series, you'll be wondering what happens next, and so did I. One can only hope and pray and wish for a new season.

The only thing I can recommend is watching this series through legal means and buying the official home releases as well as supporting the original source material that is the manga. Buy those to show your support of this universe.",1529193600,,1709,4.538961038961039
8759327,5,B01EP1NXY4,"Love this show, sort of hoping they do a second season of it.",1525824000,,61,3.769230769230769

8759329,5,B01EP1NXY4,"- Great story ( boy goes on quest to find/save his cousin/friend and meets friends along the way with a plot twist)
- good character development
- ecchi / harem / demons / magic
 I've never come across a show like this which adds to its appeal, it's one of my top ten favorite anime and is a must watch. I highly recommend buying this for yourself or as a gift.

The only downside to the show is that it may not get a second season. That being said, the show has good/great ratings with above average sales in the anime and manga, so I expect them to make a season two.",1522972800,,569,4.071428571428571
