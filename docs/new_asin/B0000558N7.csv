Even if you aren't that big of a fan, you can still buy this and probably will transform into a huge Mandy fan. The Real Story shows how sweet and down-to-earth Mandy Moore really is. She takes you on the road when she was on tour with BSB and takes you to an in store performance where she truly appreciates all people who showed up. The Real Story also includes the video to ""SO REAL"" which was only released as a single in Australia. It also has ""Candy,"" ""I wanna be with you,"" and ""walk me home."" I really reccommend that you buy this because it's just 5 star quality! And remember, Mandy's new album ""MANDY MOORE"" will be in stores on June 19th! visit [...] for more info.. or Mandy's Epic Records site [...]",989712000,,782,4.29054054054054
1393802,5,B0000558N7,"This is the complete Mandy Moore story, starting with her childhood acting parts, and continuing through the recording of her platinum-selling debut album ""So Real"", and her latest Special Edition album ""I Wanna Be With You"". You thought you knew Mandy before, but now you can get to know the real Mandy!",986515200,,304,4.865384615384615
1393803,5,B0000558N7,"The only bad thing was, the video was 50 minutes. But, the video had lots of info about Mandy and had 4 of her videos. It was fun to watch. Nice short and sweet.",982800000,,161,3.764705882352941
1393804,5,B0000558N7,"Mandy has always shown herself to have a sweet, fun personality, and she shines on her video biography.  The music is what she concentrates on, of course, and it has all four of her music videos on it in their entirety:  Candy, Walk Me Home, I Wanna Be With You, and So Real (in order of their appearance.)  The last music video was previously unreleased in the US, and it has fantastical, magic garden sort of feel to it.  There is a lot of background information on the making of the music videos, and her biography also contains concert footage, such as in when she was touring with 'N Sync or the BSB, as well as appearances when she was the featured attraction.
There is not as much background information on her actual life as I would like; the closest this comes is the home video footage of her singing the national anthem at a basketball game (she is young, but they don't mention her age.)  It then skips ahead to the beginning of her singing career.  There are scenes ranging from her first live performance at a pediatric AIDS benefit, to the recording of her first album, to her MTV appearances on shows like TRL and Say What Karaoke.  A few of her interviews might throw you off chronologically, as they'll make references to the first album ""to be released in a few months.""  *grin*  Others were recorded specifically for the video, and those are neat snippets of her personality.
If you like Mandy and her music, this is a good place to get all her videos and bonus footage in one place.  There are a few places it seems to lag, but they did well to space the music scenes so that the music livens up the slower spots.  Mandy's story is aptly named-it's the real Mandy, and you've just gotta love her.  :o)",982627200,,1722,4.4145569620253164

7931053,4,B0000558N7,"""The Real History"" is a great DVD, is a good way to see the beginnings of Mandy, her first two productions are reflected in this DVD, with her 4 first music videos.

You can see ""I Wanna Be With You"" music video subtitling and BackStage, in my opinion one of their best songs

definitely a good DVD for new fans who want to learn more about Mandy.

Amazon thanks for sending the DVD to Peru.

7931054,5,B0000558N7,"I've been a big fan of Mandy Moore, however back in the early days of DVD I missed out on buying her first DVD release, and was disappointed to find I could no longer buy it from anywhere in Australia.  Thank heavens for Amazon!!

The Real Story basically shows various music clips from Mandy's first album, plus interviews with the pop princess on how she started, what she was working on at the time etc.  Since this was shot during the release of her first album, she's sporting her good ol blonde locks and is probably 16-18 at the time.

The 50minute DVD keeps you glued to the box, being very entertaining and fast moving.  Each segment is seperated by a music video, of which are all top quality.

A must have for Mandy Moore fans.",1176163200,,738,4.389705882352941
7931055,5,B0000558N7,"This is a great DVD if you like Mandy Moore.  It covers her ealier years with ""Candy"" and ""I Wanna Be With You"".  It would've been better if it had her ""Mandy Moore"" album in but it doesn't.  Still, it is awesome.",1127692800,,213,4.023809523809524
7931056,5,B0000558N7,"I'm sure most people will agree with me, Mandy Moore isn't your typical pop star. First of all, she's too articulate, preternaturally articulate, in fact. Second, she seems grounded, unaffected by all the hullabaloo surrounding most celebrities. Most celebs invite attention to themselves and then later complain of lack of privacy. Mandy just moves around like she's just happy being where she is. And that shows in this video. If I had a daughter, I'd encourage her to make Mandy a role model.",1112140800,,495,4.975903614457831
7931057,5,B0000558N7,"Okay, so do you wanna know Mandy Moore?  Well, this is the DVD.  It shows the very down-to-earth Mandy when she was very young, to 2000.  It is great.  It features:

  This came out before her huge multi-platinum ""Mandy Moore"" & is basically all about her up until about January/February 2001.  It is a great DVD for all, and its the T.R.U.T.H.!!!!!!!!!!
  Love ya!",1077926400,,751,4.5
7931058,5,B0000558N7,"Mandy Moore is a performer who makes people happy and feel better about themselves.  This DVD reveals why.  Without question she is bursting with musical, singing and acting talent.  But underpinning these qualities is a rare human condition  -  a positive outlook.  Mandy likes herself, her work, her future, her family, her co-workers, her friends, her audiences, and life in general.  I doubt she speaks badly of anyone or anything.  You can see this attitude in her live performances, interactions with co-workers and audiences, and music videos.  They are uplifting.  There is a long documentary, narrated by Mandy, that shows how she got into show business and how she made her music videos.  Its fun to see such wisdom, focus, and spirit in a young person.  I especially enjoy the section of the DVD where her first four music videos are shown in sequence so that you can see how she progressed from gyrating young teen to suave mid-teen crooner of love songs.  These videos are very well made and clearly a cut above most.  They are fantacy skits that make good combined use of her singing and acting talents.  I like the fact that they never employ the common crutches of anger, ugly faces, profanity, nudity, or overt sexual innuendo.  Mandy is a performer that kids to oldsters can enjoy.  And all this before she even began to star in films.",1055894400,,1353,4.762931034482759
