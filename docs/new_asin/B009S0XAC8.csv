8544020,1,B009S0XAC8,Disc froze so often I could only watch perhaps half of it.  Very frustrating. I wish I had the energy to persue a refund,1446595200,,120,4.0
8544021,4,B009S0XAC8,"I am a physician and have been extremely interested about how food can be as much  part of the healing processes than a highly destructive one. Unfortunately modern life and processed food (among others factors) are killing us and our children  very fast. What serendipity that Dr Goldner was able to bring her unique and extremely moving personal account of her fight with Lupus...and have the ability, as a MD and scientist, to share the extraordinary benefits of her dietetic changes on the evolution her illness. Dr Goldner has been trained in renowned medical school and residency program and her approach is the one of an expert. For those already acquainted with the China Study, the documentary ""Forks over knives"", and the work of Dr Colin Campbell and Caldwell Eysselstyn, this highly personal account is one more evidence of the benefit of a vegan, wholefood diet.",1380326400,5,875,4.986301369863014
8544022,5,B009S0XAC8,"I purchased this DVD finding it on amazon after battling auto-immune issues for quite some time. I had tried everything on the planet to improve my symptoms and I found Dr. Goldner's DVD. Not only do I believe it is the most valuable, brilliant information that I have found(and I have seen many specialists) I think the DVD is packed with so much incredible knowledge  that I ordered her other DVD on super healthy meals for the family. I bought 2 for gifts after I watched mine. I loved the sporadic humor, which is so enlightening if you are like me, and have seen so many specialists who talk to you for 5 min. just want to prescribe prescriptions.  My horrible symptoms have dramatically improved and look forward to contacting her to take my health to next level.",1359417600,8,769,4.565217391304348
8544023,3,B009S0XAC8,"I purchased this to show to my Anatomy/Physiology students to help them better understand about lupus. While the speaker does provide excellent information regarding the disorder and how she overcame it, she tried to incorporate humor which wasn't always successful.",1358380800,2,266,5.675
