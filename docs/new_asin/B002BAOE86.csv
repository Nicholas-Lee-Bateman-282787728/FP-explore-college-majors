8360944,4,B002BAOE86,"Moto X: Evolution of the Trick (2009) Fantastic DVD!! Actually rate at 4 1/2
I'll start with my only reason I didn't give this DVD a five star rating. I wanted to learn HOW the tricks are done - with explanations. - The only one explained is Travis's 360. Other than that - a Great DVD - and like the title - shows What evolved in Freestyle Motocross. - Touches on history of motocross coming from Europe - and in the 60's in the states. Lots of great moments here - Metzger back-flipping the fountains in Vegas, Pastrana's Double Back-flip, Ryan Capes - doing a huge 300+ record jump, on a bonus - they have Robbie Maddison's New Years Eve jump in Vegas - where he does a Step-Up jump - 10 Stories up and then jumps off this 'arch' to drop 5 stories to connect with landing ramp 5 stories down!!
Many Many tricks. One thing I like - and may show I'm 49 now - No semi- nudity, the music it tolerable. Some riders have 'ink' - but I don't have to look at that much.
Too Many Riders names to list (about 15+) and too many tricks to list  (about 22).
Amazing Footage!! I highly recommend!! There are so many Free Style Motocross DVDs here on Amazon - and No ratings, This one I suggest you get. Scott MacNeil.",1296777600,6,1206,4.198275862068965
8360945,5,B002BAOE86,"Evolution of the trick.......anything Freestyle Motocross is great to own in my opinion.
This dvd has everything you wanted to know about the tricks,and the defeat of trying a new trick.

Hell, the segments of the Caesars Tabletop is great in itself.

Thanks Travis !!",1253404800,3,268,4.933333333333334
