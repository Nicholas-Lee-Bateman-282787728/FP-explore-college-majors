5004822,4,B006MHZG40,"Die (Dominic James, 2010)

There is an oddly compelling, at least to me, subgenre of torture porn that's come to the surface over the last couple of years where instead of the psychotic killer preying on the hapless victims a la Hostel or Turistas or Train or..., instead, the psychotic killer-who's-not-actually-a-killer throws the hapless victims into a room and forces them to do terrible things to each other in exchange for the possibility of winning their freedom. There have been some pretty solid movies along these lines (Nine Dead comes to mind), and of course there have been some awful ones (Vile, The Killing Room, etc.). Die, I am very pleased to report, is of the former camp. We start off with the very title of the film, which is a double-entendre; you can already tell, before you even open the case, that you're dealing with a writer and director (screenwriter Domenico Salvaggio has been James' partner in crime since their first short together, ""Lotto 6/66"") who are head and shoulders above a dozen Darren Lynn Bousmans or Marcus Dunstans. Then we get--hey!--moral dilemmas that are actually interesting, rather than a ""script"" that exists as nothing more than an excuse to showcase Rube Goldberg-esque ways of killing people. (In fact, the methods of death in this movie are quite mundane, which seems to have annoyed some folks on the IMDB boards. I thought that was a strength, rather than a weakness, since it kept the viewer's focus exactly where it should be.)

Plot: while I think this was supposed to be a spoiler, it's mentioned in the plot synopses at Netlifx and on the jacket copy. Six people, all of whom were considering, or were in the process of committing, suicide all wake up in some sort of large, dimly-lit room in hastily-constructed plexiglass cages. We have Lisa (Cosmopolis' Emily Hampshire), a compulsive blackjack player who's just lost her life savings. Zach (The Recruit's Karl Pruner), a psychiatrist. Robert (Transgression's Fabio Fulco), a philanthropist and motivational speaker who focuses on helping the clinically depressed. Melody (The Master's Katie Boland), a heroin-addicted teen. Diane (Sigma's Patricia McKenzie), a nurse. And, most importantly--though no one in the room, including the person who brought them there, knows it--Mark (Crash's Elias Koteas), a cop who's seen, and done, far too much to want to continue living. He's important because his disappearance causes his partner, Sofia Valenti (Casino Royale's Caterina Murino), to start connecting the dots that lead to Jacob Odessa (Drive's John Pyper-Ferguson), the man who kidnapped them--and who now pits them against one another, forcing each to use their own method of attempting suicide on one of the others, with the possible lethality determined by the roll of a die. As an example, in the first encounter, Mark, who being a cop was planning on swallowing his revolver, is the game's aggressor, and Robert is the victim. Odessa forces Mark to roll the die; the number that comes up is the number of chambers which will contain bullets in the modified Russian roulette Jacob has them playing. If the hammer doesn't fall on a chamber with a bullet, Robert walks away. If it does, he dies.

The moral underpinning of the story, obviously, is right out of the first Saw film; Jigsaw's aim, too, in the early days was to take those who felt their lives had no meaning and teach them the value of living. Such is also Odessa's goal, and his means of achieving it are more mundane, less showy. As I said before, to me, that makes for a stronger work; the audience spends less time waiting for ""he doesn't want us to saw through the chain, he wants us to saw through our ankles!"", and forgetting that the rest of the movie is actually way more interesting. (After all, if they hadn't forgotten that, all seven Saw-franchise movies might actually be well-plotted, well-acted, tense mysteries, rather than movies two through seven going down in infamy as the franchise that started the torture porn movement.) Add to this that James found himself with an exceptional cast, and while he doesn't coax career-best performances out of any of the folks here, the cast handles themselves as well as the cast of Nine Dead did, and that's good enough for yours truly. As many have pointed out, yes, the end of the film is kind of ridiculous and does drag the entire thing down a notch, and there are some really, really weird oversights in the script that I can't help but wonder why no one caught. Still, I was willing to overlook those problems, given how much better this movie is overall than pieces of crap like Vile that tried to tread the same ground and made a dog's dinner of it. I had a great deal of fun with this movie, and I think if you're willing to forgive it some of its odder peccadilloes, you will as well. *** ",1364342400,,4842,4.830120481927711
5004823,4,B006MHZG40,The movie was brand new. No scrathes or scrapes. However the movie itself could have been better. I did not like the ending. But i did like the torture.,1351296000,,152,4.275862068965517
5004824,4,B006MHZG40,"Didn't have any major complaints with this one. This movie was along the lines of SAW without the overwhelming bloodshed. I like gore, but this movie was fine without it. The characters were interesting, the acting was great, all actors you've seen before. There is plenty of killing, it's just the methods are gruesome. It has a nice pace and keeps you wanting to see who has to roll the di next and what number comes up. Good movie for horror fans as well as thriller fans.",1335052800,2,475,4.471264367816092
5004825,3,B006MHZG40,"Here's a TLDR review: This flick is very similar to the Saw franchise (right down to the cover art). It's less bloody but has a parallel theme: an evil super-villain tries to help people by torturing them. As usual, some live and some die.

On the up side, the acting is great with top notch directing / cinematography. The sound track is solid and didn't detract from what was happening on screen. Unfortunately, all the talent was wasted because of the script.

I have to say 3 stars out of 5 because it just felt like a Saw clone in more ways than I could count. Beyond the stale material, the pacing was quite tedious; yet despite the slow pace, it got confusing because the 6 victims each have an extensive back story. Plus the villain and the investigator-ette have baggage that had to be explained. Overall there wasn't enough emphasis on the main characters and too much screen time was wasted on the supporting cast. Toward the end they try to work in a couple ""twists"" . . . unfortunately those just served to muddle the story even farther.

As much as I want to give this 4 stars because of the talent in front of and behind the camera, it is only a 3 star movie. 'Die' is worth a rental, but it's not worth adding to your horror-thriller library.",1334275200,3,1258,4.413793103448276
5004826,3,B006MHZG40,"DIE has an interesting premise, borrowing somewhat from the SAW franchise but attempting to offer a more ""redemptive"" slant.  I had a little trouble in following some of the plot's complexities especially regarding Jacob's conflictual nice guy/cold hearted killer persona.  DIE has a dark, almost surrealistic feel although its slow pacing can be frustrating.
The cast does a decent job especially the reliable Elias Koteas as the tormented cop and John Pyper-Ferguson whose non-chalant wickedness is quietly chilling.
Unlike SAW, DIE eschews excessive gore or protracted extensive scenes of violence.  DIE could've been a refreshing change of pace from standard torture flicks, but it's lack of dramatic cohesion and a weak pacing keeps it from truly transcending its genre.",1333584000,2,775,5.495798319327731
5004827,3,B006MHZG40,"This at first seemed to be a lot like Saw, but it went beyond that and into the realm of chance and the roll of the dice.  The acting and music were far better than what one would normally expect from this type of film too.",1333152000,3,223,3.847826086956522
5004828,3,B006MHZG40,"""When you have seen the things that I have seen you begin to live by your own rules."" After a group of six strangers wake up in the same room they start to wonder how they got there. When the man that brought them there begins to force them to use a die to decide the fate of each other the group looks for a way to fight back. I have said before that Hollywood is out of ideas. Once one movie hits big the rips-offs begin coming from everywhere. This one is in the vein of the ""Saw"" franchise. A man forces a group of strangers to face their flaws in order to change things. This one does not have any of the gore that ""Saw"" did but it does have the same idea. The people that are playing the ""game"" are not innocents and are forced to choose between who they want to be and who they were. While this is not a bad movie at all it is about the 100th version of ""Saw"" that I have seen so this is really nothing new. I will say that in it's own way it is entertaining and if you like these type of movies it's worth a watch. Overall, another ""Saw"" rip-off that is better then most. I give it a B.",1332288000,,1094,3.888392857142857
5004829,4,B006MHZG40,"Six seemingly random strangers find themselves locked inside glass holding cells, two captives per, wondering just what set this in motion. One minute they were at home, wallowing in their horrid lives, then events brought them there. What were the chances? If they asked their captor, he would probably say something to the effect of ""its just the will of the die."" This leads to introspection playing out, questions being asked and, of course, tribulations. How else can you be reborn?

While I like horror movies a lot and enjoy a lot of films that do not make the theater rounds, I have become afraid of a lot of films lately. Sometimes it seems like anyone with a handicam and a few bucks can make a film and distribute it. At first I had the same fear of this movie but it turned out it was not a ""horror on a budget"" flick. Watching it, I thankfully found I liked Die.

As far as film quality,it is not bad. The way the plot works, you do not need a lots of bells and whistles for it to be good. The movie basically deals with Jacob and the way he tries to repair lives, plus the people he tries to repair while following the will of the die. As a kid, Jacob saw his father shoot himself after he had his son roll the number of bullets to put in his handgun. Now he firmly believes that, to embrace life, a person oftentimes needs to be right at the edge of demise. This means he uses people that are attempting death, salvaging them and giving them his version of a second chance. The people he deals with have some interesting ""how I got here"" tales, and the things that happen to them as tribulations are not random but connect to them personally.

Overall, I liked the way it played out. You have rules to the way it is done and, in some ways, they work. There were a few flaws in the way the rules set up, like a 1 might mean a bullet or it might mean taking the first of six of something out and using it. I really thought that could have used more explaining. Then again, I guess the character isn't exactly sane so reason could go out the window. There also is something in the end, with the number six being special, i would like explained. You'd think a six would be terrible, a death sentence, but Jacob notes it as special and then it sort of goes away. Stuff like that is small, but it is nice to know how things work.

Die does not have a lot of gore to it and does not get too graphic in its depictions, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The idea is not about death, but about a second chance if fate, and Jacob, allow it. It also tries to hook some other stuff into it later on, diluted the idea a bit with old cases and a cult, but it still doesn't hurt the film too terrible much.

This would be a film I would recommend only for people looking in horror or maybe a little mixed-genre experience. As a horror film, I'd give it a 3.5/5 for that type of experience, saying it falls somewhere between ok and I like it. If you have some time to burn, it isn't a bad view.",1331596800,4,2999,4.163793103448276
5004830,5,B006MHZG40,"I think what makes this movie good is the basic idea behind it. The people being held captive are forced to roll a die (there is a back story as to why the guy holding them hostage makes them roll a die, but I'll let you find that out for yourself when you watch it) and the outcome of their roll impacts someone else. For example, a man has to role a die and what number it lands on he must put that many bullets in a gun and shoot the person. Another woman has to roll the die and what number it lands on depends on how many minutes a person has to be submerged under water (if it lands on 1 it is only one minute, 2 is 2 minutes and so on). I just thought that it was a cool concept that hasn't been done before as far as I know and it was fun to watch the outcome of each roll of the die. This is a pretty cool concept for a film and I think that most viewers would agree.

It isn't ultra violent, but I was so into the story that I didn't really mind this time around (normally I am one of those people who thinks the more violent and gory a movie is the better).  The movie has a more realistic feel to it and I liked the fact that the filmmakers didn't try to make the deaths super violent and gory (wow, being a gore hound myself I never thought I would make such a statement. The end of the world may be nigh).

I really liked the cast of characters as well. Elias Koteas (who is looking pretty rough and worse for wear these days) is top notch as Mark, the suicidal cop who is under investigation for killing someone. Emily Hampshire is also equally good as the woman who isn't so happy to be a mother and suffers from a gambling addiction. The person who steals the show though, is John Pyper-Ferguson who does a great job playing the demented antagonist Jacob Odd. I thought that this character was just kick ass and he would make a perfect Batman villain. I wouldn't necessarily say that he's an evil person as in his sick and twisted mind he thinks he's helping the people he abducts. He has a pretty cool back story and he's just so insane and out there you can't help but like him. Though his methods may be a little unorthodox I think deep down he truly wants to help others, so in my opinion I can't really say that the character is a bad person.

I thought that the ending was great as well. There are a couple of pretty cool twists toward the end that I didn't see coming and both of them work. I am not going to say a word about either one as I want you to find these out for yourself when you watch them, but let's just say that at least one of them comes completely out of nowhere and I could actually see it happening in real life. The ending leaves things open for a sequel, and I really hope that the filmmakers follow through. I know I wouldn't mind seeing the next chapter of the story.

I was really into ""Die."" While it is more of a thriller than a horror movie. It's well-written, suspenseful, and has a couple of cool twists that make you think. I urge you to check it out. I think that you will be pleasantly surprised.",1328832000,7,3052,4.054726368159204

8500821,3,B006MHZG40,"I liked this one more than I thought I would. Great twist on the 'sadistic captor' story line. Using the failings of one to judge another was very clever and the focus was on the psychological aspect more than just mindless, graphic gore-porn. Plot ran thin a few times, but it was easy to overlook to allow the narrative to weave between the characters.",1422921600,,354,4.546875

You see immediately who the killer is, so that isn't a mystery. He chooses 2 people from the cages, sits one down and the other has to roll a die (one dice) to come up with a number pertinent to the person in the chair, for example, take a gun roll the die, put that number of bullets in the gun and fire at the seated person etc. Did they die in the process of get ""reborn"" (survive).  It was much better than I thought it would be and had some pretty good suspenseful moments. The actors were good as was the story. The mystery is ""why them?"" That does run in a similar vein to ""Saw"". I do recommend this movie, it did hold my interest. Would you roll the die?",1415318400,,781,4.006410256410256
8500823,4,B006MHZG40,"The cover art of the movie is a little too graphic, given what the movie is about.  Many have compared it to ""Saw"", but let's not forget, ""Saw"" had truly despicable characters-I didn't care if they died or not.  Whereas the characters in ""Die"" are ""ordinary"" people who are just really depressed.  These are characters who have made mistakes-not diabolical monsters.  And only Elias Koteas (wonderful as always) is truly unredeemable despondent. They could easily have made this a weird spiritual thriller instead of going for the mental aspect, and it still would have worked.  Great movie-wonderful surprise.",1379980800,,610,5.183673469387755
