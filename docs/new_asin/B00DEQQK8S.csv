5795350,3,B00DEQQK8S,"I'll be glad to ditch my antiquated DVDs of Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X, and my extraneous Blu-ray of the 2009 film to save some shelf space.  The high-def upgrades of 1-11 are welcome.  However, is there anyone who actually prefers these collector's tins?  Unless you want to display it on a blood-stained altar in your living room, you have to put it on a shelf with the rest of your collection.  Based on the promotional photo I've seen, there's no title on the spine of the tin.  I guess no one thought of that.  If you own the original Superman or Rambo DVD sets, you already know how unwieldy and unattractive these tins are alongside regular DVDs or Blu-rays.  And unlike the recent Mad Max tin, which houses a shelf-worthy blu-ray case, it doesn't seem to be the case with the F13 set -- looks like a cardboard book deal that isn't intended to be shelved naked.  I'm considering cancelling my pre-order on the assumption that a tin-less set will be released within a year with the same content in a thick BD case.

There wasn't enough gore in the first film for me and much of the violence was left to your imagination.  Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives is my favorite Friday the 13th movie.  This collection is definitely a must for all Friday the 13th fans.  Between Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, my favorite slasher movies are the Friday the 13th movies.

5795354,3,B00DEQQK8S,"This is not the set we waited for and the only reason i give it 3 stars is because it has 7 F13 films out of 12 for the first time in blu ray so this is a chance to complete your F13 blu ray collection. So far only FvJ, the remake and parts 1,2,3 were released in blu ray.
 Problem is FOR THE DIE HARD FANS u get nothing new except the blu ray versions of 7 films for the first time and here are reasons why to avoid this set.
 1) THERE ARE NO UNCUT VERSIONS
 2) THERE ARE NO NEW EXTRAS
 3) EVEN THE BOOK INSIDE IT'S TAKEN FROM THE CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES BOOK
 4) THERE ARE NO ALICE COOPER VIDEOS FROM JASON LIVES
 So if u are a die hard fan and u own the official F13 book, u own all 12 films already and u also own all the extras and the docum HIS NAME IS JASON then this set is almost USELESS and it's only saved BY IT'S FIRST EVER BLU RAY VERSIONS OF 7 FILMS so it's your choice to decide.
 I was expecting full uncut versions and i don't get them.
 I was expecting new extras and i don't get them.
 I OWN ALL 12 FILMS ALREADY IN DVD'S AND FIVE OF THEM IN BLU RAY PLUS I OWN CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES THE OFFICIAL BOOK AND THE DVD BOX SET FROM CRYSTAL LAKE TO MANHATTAN WITH IT'S EXTRAS WHICH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME IN THIS SET.
 If at least they were the uncut versions i would have bought the set. Now i don't know. Maybe i will wait and see what happens with individual blu ray f13 movies releases. If they don't release the rest movies seperately maybe i will buy this set only to have the 7 movies left for the first time in blu ray BUT I'M REALLY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS RELEASE.

 PLEASE RELEASE ALL 12 FILMS IN UNCUT VERSIONS AND WITH NEW EXTRAS FEATURES. THAT SET WILL BE DESERVED FOR ALL THE FANATIC F13 FANS.",1371254400,38,1715,3.9248554913294798
5795355,5,B00DEQQK8S,"Through their new home video deal, Warner (in addition with New Line) and Paramount bring you the ultimate Friday The 13th Blu-ray set.

What do you get?:

-All 10 original F13 films PLUS Freddy Vs. Jason and the 2009 F13 remake
-7 Films (F13 Part 4-Jason X) making their Blu-ray debut
-11 Hours of previously released extras
-A bonus DVD disc featuring extras on the making of the series
-40-page booklet featuring excerpts from Crystal Lake Memories
-Tin packaging
-Camp Crystal Lake counselor patch

For those who wanted the remaining films on Blu-ray, sell your copies of F13 1-3, FVJ, and F13 '09 and buy this set and for those who never or haven't yet got the films on Blu-ray, this is the only F13 Blu-ray set you'll ever need. So get your copy today!

UPDATES: There's questions as to whether or not F13 and JGTH will be unrated. Well, extras were revealed today (6/28). I read them and while they say R-Rated Theatrical Version for both titles, the specs for F13 '80 is identical to the original Blu release and JGTH features the commentary which on the DVD, was for the Unrated Version only. So if anything it's possible we are getting the Unrated cuts for those 2. For those who think we're getting only the Theatrical Cuts of those 2 films, let me remind you NOTHING IS FINAL. But I say with all confidence that it's again possible we ARE getting the Unrated Versions of those 2 films. I will point out though that all other films WILL be their original R-Rated Theatrical Versions (however, F13 '09 will have both Rated and Unrated cuts seeing is how the disc in the set is the same as previously released).

UPDATE 9/4/13: A Blu-ray.com forum member got the set early and confirmed that F13 '80 is Uncut but unfortunately JGTH is the R-Rated Theatrical Version. So sad news for those who were hoping for the Unrated Cut (like I was).",1371168000,68,1847,4.584848484848485

The box is made from metal, with an embossed(not flat) image of Jason with his machete.  A lot of people seemed to have damaged/scratched discs because of the cardboard 'mediabook' style packaging, but mine were thankfully scratch free.
You get a lot of extras in this set(some movies get more than others), and you even get a few physical goodies.  :)
There's two pairs of simple 3D glasses for the third Friday film, a Camp Crystal Lake counselor iron on patch, and a booklet with some history and behind the scenes info on the movies(it's really just a very condensed version of ""Crystal Lake Memories"" book by Peter M Bracke).

5795372,3,B00DEQQK8S,"Reviewing the Friday the 13th Blu Ray Box Set comes with a lot to praise and a few big disappointments. I read many reviews for this set before purchasing it ( at a fair price of around $70). Im pretty happy with it, but there are a few grievences. Most of the negative reviews come from diehard fans who wanted uncut versions of every film, but I think its something that has to be looked at film to film. The original film on disc 1 is the uncut version and it only adds a few seconds. The extra gore really doesnt enhances the first film and actually makes a lot of the effects look less realistic. Fortunately the first films Blu Ray transfer looks very good, better than it deserves and the extra gore is minimal so it doesnt take away from the film in any way. I would rate the original film 2 3/4 stars only because dispite its crudeness it is enjoyable and we get to see an early Kevin Bacon role.

The second film is more of the same and I mean that in a bad way, best scene Terry skinny dipping, Savini is sorely missed here, but this isn't the worst Friday in the series. The Blu Ray once again looks very good!

The third films only merit is that it gives birth to the Jason with his signature hockey mask we all know and love! As a movie its pretty bad until the last 20 minutes and the 3D is only a distraction and does nothing to enhance the film. In fact it ruins the gore sequences because all we see are spears, knives and arrows coming at the screen. Both films get s 2 1/4 star rating with Savini's talent missed for a second time.

Now we come to the forth film which is the best in the series up to this point. The Blu Ray looks very good. 3 stars for The Final Friday. Savinis return is welcome with one of the best (Jasons) death sequences in the entire series.

The fifth film isn't nearly as bad as its reputation in fact I give the writers credit for trying to come up with something different. That being said 2 stars is all this one deserves mostly because of some annoying characters that can't act their way out of a paper bag, Horrible acting plagued too many of these films resulting in my poor ratings for installments 1,2,3 and 5. Oddly enough it took 6 films before the franchise started to really improve. Jason Lives (my personal favorite with The New Blood a very close second). Jason Lives has the best opening (nod to James Bond is genius!) and ending of any of the Fridays, the homage to gothic horror and wit really set this one apart from the rest of the series. The Blu Ray looks very good, maybe a little dark, but I think that was the intension of the filmmaker. The New Blood (7th in the series) is another great entry, is also introduced mine and everyones favorite Jason, Kane Hodder. While not a giant, Hodder is extremely menacing and has the presence needed to make Jason one scary MFer! The zombie make up design is just fantastic showing all of the injuries Jason has sustained over the years. Both of these films should have included the uncut versions and this is probably the biggest disappointment in the entire box set. Id rate both of these films 4 out of 5 stars just for finally winning me over and the improvments made from the first 5 installments.

Unfortunately the franchise takes a nose dive at this point with two of the worst films in the series Jason Takes Manhattan and Jason Goes to Hell. Jason Takes Manhattan has good intensions, but budget restraints and not paying attention to details with the storyline from past installments hurts this film a lot. First off, the film should have been called Jason visits the Love Boat, because most of the film takes place for the sorriest excuse for a cruise ship Ive ever seen. Secondly, and to me even more important is the look of young Jason during flashbacks, it isn't consistent with the original film. Jasons bad eye has mysteriously moved from left to right and he has a full head of hair sometimes and a really poor makeup job at other times. Jasons Zombie look is gone and he miraculously has grown flesh over his skeleton body we saw in the last film. The ending which sounds like a cool idea is so poorly executed that it is hard not to wince every time I watch it. Its just a sad, sad ending to a series that showed promise with installments 6 and 7. Now we come to Jason goes to Hell, first, they didn't carry over the unrated cut of the film to this release which I find really annoying. It was already available on the DVD so it should have been included on this set considering there is hardly any bonus content on this disc. If one version was to be included it should have been the unrated version (like the first film). This film is really really pushing the boundries of absurdity (in a bad way!). No explanation of how Jason was resurrected from the last film where he was disinegrated in toxic waste.  His heart still lives as a monster who can use another body as a host, Oh boy where does it end? I suppose its a way to keep the franchise going, but by now this is getting tiresome. As far as the unrated cut of the film the biggest difference is two death scenes, the tent scene with the girl is much cooler with her being impailed and then getting split in half. The other is at the diner which is also superior in the unrated version. Regarless its not the end of the world its just annoying considering fans have been very vocal about wanting the unrated versions for years! My guess (or wishful thinking?) is another box set will come out in a few years with the all unrated versions.

The next film is Jason X, but for my own sanity I can not watch or review that film before what should have been the next film Freddy VS Jason (if we are following the story arc). Freddy VS Jason is an improvement over the last two films and actually quite slick looking. Kane Hodder isn't Jason, but I do think this may have been because they wanted a taller Jason for a more dynamic contrast between the two iconic monsters. This film gets its own disc and it also seems to have all the bonus material carried over from the 2 disc DVD release. Making me wonder why they didn't squeezed the unrated cut of Jason goes to Hell on this release somewhere? OK so now I watch Jason X which should be a total disaster, but it surprisingly isnt. Its quite slick looking with decent acting and effects dispite its absurd storyline. This certainly isn't the worst Friday by any stretch, in fact I like it for its throw your hands in the air anything goes premise. This film also receives a fair amount of bonus material all carried over from previous release. The next disc houses the remake Theatrical and Killer Cut. Its such a shame this remake didn't turn out like I hoped it would. The original Friday was a decent little film made for very little money. I assumed this remake would combine the best elements of the first three films and adding some more to the story, this making for an impressive and worthy remake, but instead the writers thought it would be a great idea to make Jason Human. This wouldnt be such a bad idea if there weren't numerous human maniacs in films already, Supernatural killing machines like Jason are pretty rare. Its an OK film, but it doesnt add enough to make it very memorable. Still Im glad they included both versions of it regardless. I will point out I hate the menu for this disc as it took a little time to figure out how to change from one version to the other. The last disc is just a huge slap in the face. The Killer Bonus disc is nothing short of a complete waste of space. The material on it is already on the collection broken into sections on each disc. I would have rather had the missing unrated version of Jason Goes To Hell and theatrical version of the original Friday on a Blu Ray disc than this SD disc of redundant material.  Its nice to replace my old DVD box set and the few films not included on that set with this set. It is a worthy purchase considering the upgrade in quailty and space saving package. With a few glaring flaws this is still the best set to have for this franchise.

I suppose in a perfect world this collection would have received a treatment similar to the Halloween Blu Ray Box Set with 10 and 15 discs versions of the set. This would have allowed for (at the very least) the unrated cuts of all the films (especially Jason Lives, The New Blood and lets not forget Jason Goes to Hell!). The His Name was Jason documenary could have been included and even Crystal Lake Memories for good measure.

Enough wishful thinking. A quick recap, the first four films receive their own disc and the bonus material range from 75-80 minutes for the first film, 60 or so for the second and a litlle less for the following two films.  When we get to the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th films they're paired two to a disc which is a little disappointing. I couldn't detect any down grade in quality and by now the bonus material is getting so repeticious that I was tired of watching the behind the scens stuff after disc 3. I cant understand why reviewers were complaining about nothing new being added to the bonus section for this set. What more could be said that hasn't been regurgitated a million times? There is only so much that can be said about a franchise that is fair at best. There are no great Friday the 13th films NONE, but Im a fan and I do enjoy them. Jason is an iconic monster that has stood the test of time. It is Jason who sells this series not the films themselves. For me the best films in the series are part 1, 4, 6 and 7. Oddly enough I had watched the first couple of films on video and it wasn't until I saw Jason Lives that I really started to develop a love for the unstoppable force Jason Voohees. Im a huge fan of the 1931 Frankenstein film and I loved the nod to that film in Jason Lives. Being brought back to life by Lightning, the Karloff general store and who could resist the James Bond Homage in the beginning of the film. I have to admit that this is the film that made me take to Jason as an icon of horror.

OK Im rambling now, but as you can see it is easy to get distracted when watching and or review this massive collection. The discs that feature two films only have around 30 minutes of bonus material for each film. Its really enough and for me, the Lost Tales of Camp Blood that are a bonus on each disc are just a complete waste of space! All of the films have received pretty nice transfers that should please fans. It should be noted that this collection includes both theartical and uncut versions of the remake (something that should have been done for the Halloween box set) and also the Freddy VS Jason crossover film, which was left out of the Nightmare on Elm Street collection. The Killer Bonus disc is the biggest disappointment as the material on it is already included in sections on each disc. Id have much rather had the unrated cut of Jason Goes to Hell than this entire disc and I dedected one star from this set because of this. It all been said a million times already there is nothing new to learn about the Friday films, but to include the exact same footage as a bonus disc is just a sneaky, greedy trick and shows no respect to fans.

Overall this is a very good set, with all films present and enough bonus material that I can disgard my old DVD collection (with the possible exception of Jason goes to Hell for the Unrated Cut). I personally like the packaging and have never had trouble with these types of laminated sleeves, the tin is nice if a little thin, Camp Crystal Lake Patch, 2 sets of 3D glasses and booklet round our a pretty decent tribute to one of the 80s most iconic monsters. If this box set had included Jason Goes to Hell, Jason Lives and The New Blood Unrated cuts I probably would have rated this 5 stars because a lot attention went into this release. Think not? Take a look at the medicore release A Nightmare on Elm Street and Saw Franchises received and youll see this is superior in every way.",1446076800,3,11990,4.318827708703375

I have all the Friday the 13th and Jason movies as I am a die hard Jason fan. I love the metal case, The book that comes with it, The Camp Counselor Patch (Iron on) I even went and bought a Cream colored sweater and Ironed it on lol, and a special elastic red band with good old ""Crazy Ralph's"" quote "" I told the others, they didn't believe me YOU'RE ALL DOOMED""  2 pairs of 3d glasses for Part 3 and of course all Jason films. Jason goes to Hell is the R rated version, Includes Freddy VS Jason with the horrible Jason Ken Kirsinger, unlike the New Freddy collection does not have Freddy Vs Jason. Also includes the Remake of Friday the 13th 2009 Version with Derick Mears portraying Jason but it is not the Killer Cut. The DVD holder is not plastic cases it is made of Sleeves but overall This is a must for Jason fans.  The collection is Worth every Penny!!!!

I am very BIG fan of the Friday films and I spent a pretty penny to get what I thought was coming, none the less, it is still the only set with all film's on Blu-Ray so I guess it will do until they make a set with all the Unrated cut's!

5795424,5,B00DEQQK8S,I want to start off by saying this box set is amazing! The tin case it comes in is outstanding and perfect for any collection. The only bad thing I have to say about it is the fact that there is no writing on the spine. It's all just a flat black. On the inside you get the cool little patch and some paper 3D glasses for watching Part 3 if you choose to watch the outdated 3D version. The preview booklet for crystal lake memories is pretty awesome as well. It has little snippets about each film in there along with pictures. Now the one thing I've seen many people complain about is the packaging for discs. I had no problem with it. All of the discs were perfect. You also get a code for all of the films digital versions so you can take them on the go. The only down side about this collection was the missing unrated cut of Jason Goes To Hell. That's an easy fix though as you can pick it up on DVD for less than $5 on Amazon. All in all I'd say this is the perfect box set for any Friday the 13th fan!,1408320000,2,1008,3.9704433497536944

Sad that amazon stopped taking orders for this because some idiots didn't know what they were talking about. Anyway, got it at Best Buy for $99. The movies look and sound good, and the set comes with a cool camp crystal lake counselor patch, 3D glasses for Part 3, and a really nice booklet.

The movies themselves look very good in these blu ray transfers as far as the ones I've watched. An enjoyable set that any Friday the 13th movie lover should have.
I have to relate an anecdote about the first Friday the 13th movie as I saw this when it originally came out at a local drive-in. Well, at the climax (I'm assuming everyone reading this has seen the movie) when Alice decapitates Mrs. Voorhees practically the whole drive-in full of cars erupted in honking their horns. It was one of those memorable moments that one can only say, ""You had to be there."" It was a wild experience that I wish younger horror movie fans had the opportunity to enjoy.

Plus I did not get any scratched discs so I'm guessing that issue was taken care of after the first pressing. It's 12 bluray movies plus the bonus DVD from the DVD set so I felt it was a great deal even owning the previous box. Great sound and picture quality. Keep your unrated Jason goes to Hell DVD and extras from Freddy vs Jason and your not missing much else. Plus the classic 3D worked for me. Don't understand the complaint.

1. the packaging... they way they're placed, the discs can easily be damaged. ive had previous box sets like this and they're not worth it

2. no unrated versions... if the dvd box set had these then why doesnt this? i say its so they can get money for this then release another box set with the unrated versions

3. DVD special disc.... a recycled bonus disc. is there nothing more to add? thats fine but if its a blu ray box set then why not have those on blu ray as well?",1389484800,2,637,3.8846153846153846

The biggest thing and most disappointing is the Unrated Version of Jason Goes to Hell.  Because of this I had to hold onto my DVD copy of the film and have it take up more space on my DVD shelf.

The other thing is how some movie companies, most notably Warner Bros, release their sets in these cardboard sleeves.  In previous reviews I've read is how people keep having to exchange these sets (my discs were fine).  I would think this would end up costing them more money to constantly replace these instead of releasing snap cases.

The set itself is made very well and every movie is included. would give the video upgrade a solid B+ and the audio a B. I don't worry about 3D as no set that comes out will have everything and please everyone. I would have loved it more and gave it 5 stars if the set was encased in a collectable cabin or in the shape of a knife. That would just be an added bonus...Still an awesome set though.,1388793600,,467,3.9263157894736844

Getting them out was when I saw a -grave- error: red/blue 3D cardboard glasses... the 3D movie in the franchise which I thought would be 3D blu-ray is actually in Anaglyph! As in this ""complete collection"" has no 3D blu-ray release of the 3D version like the other boxsets that have 3D films did (Amityville).

Pros:
- Decent collection of Blu-rays

Con:
- NO 3D blue-ray of Friday the 13th 3D",1387843200,,720,4.744

The only odd thing is that the Killer Extras DVD has the same disc art as the old Paramount release, I do know the contents are exactly the same, but in the promo images the changed it to the black&gray design as all the BR discs on the set.

5795470,4,B00DEQQK8S,"Though it lacks some of the previous special features found on the DVD discs, it is still the best you can get as far as picture quality goes. It is unfortunate that the set doesn't have any director's cuts as previous editions had. That being said, if you don't have the entire collection (I had Part 7 and Versus on DVD), then this is the set you've most likely been waiting for. I had no problem buying my childhood on blu ray: Jason stalking and cutting up people, and me enjoying every moment of the bad acting, terrible scripting and murderous techniques of the hockey mask wearing slasher icon.

Get it if you just want to have the entire set in one shot. The packaging is really nice, but the disc storage is dated. Who stores movie discs in tight cardboard sleeves? They sacrificed on internal box space with the cardboard sleeve book, which looks sharp, but is just not appropriate for a collection of blu rays. The little picture and information book is cool. The 3D Part 3 is unwatchable, at least for me. I had to watch it in plain ol' HD. So there is the obligatory red/blue 3D glasses to view Part 3D. If you don't use Ultraviolet, you must not travel. If you do travel, I hope you give Ultraviolet a shot. It is a website that you can watch your movies from, or download them to your devices. Not sure if you want to fire up Part 4 or the new 2009 redux, but all you have to do is register the box set code and now you can watch Jason cut it up wherever you go.

I like this set a lot despite it's shortcomings.",1383782400,2,1527,4.243986254295533

Finally the 3D version of part 3 would be released without the need for those annoying Anaglyph glasses and they would give you a ""true"" 3D version using your TV's polarized glasses (cleaner picture, less noise, and just a better viewing experience) Wrong! once again we are stuck with the crappy red and blue glasses. Come on Paramount, the movie was released in theaters with the polarized glasses how hard could it be to release it for 3D TVs in the same format?
 Because of this I'm going to hold off and hope down the road it happens, for god's sake MGM/Shout Factory just released Amityville 3D on Blu-ray using the current 3D blu-ray and Television technology, how hard could it be?",1382572800,4,743,4.628787878787879

Now at least having Jason goes to hell uncut when the freaking download is uncut is just a slap in the face. That movie is much better uncut. Actually anything after the 4th one is bounds better uncut vs. the hack job the rating board put on them.

If I was in charge here's what i'd do.

- Have uncut unrated versions of all the films

- New remastered 4K transfer for ea film (ghostbusters had one, other older films as well)

- HD DTS track for every one

- Commentaries for ea. film

- actual 3D for the 3rd film to take advantage of new 3D tvs

- Include the new excellent documentary

- Non cardboard packaging

I mean seriously how freaking hard is that!!! Freddy also had a shameful boxset. Freddy built newline and they couldn't even show proper respect. Ugh.

5795481,5,B00DEQQK8S,"I grew up watching these horror films as a kid and teenager, so buying the complete collection off Amazon.com was an extremely easy and convenient choice. Best Buy was the only other store carrying the steel book case, and it was like $99.99 there. So, Amazon sold it for $89.99, and I selected express shipping...so ultimately I paid like $110 for rush delivery...and the following week, I saw it at Best Buy reduced down to $84.99 in their Halloween blu-ray section. Sucked at first, but I'm satisfied just to add this to my collection. The only 2 things missing from the set itself is the uncut version of the original Friday the 13th (all 10 seconds!!) and the killer cut of the new 2009 remake. What made this collection a must-have was that it came with UltraViolet digital copies that I could add to my Cloud.

I'm really loving the photos and artwork on the ""book"" sleeves that the discs come in. The transfer is sharp and looks good, but there was not much clean up on some of the older films which didn't impress me much.

5795484,3,B00DEQQK8S,"First off, these movies do look better than they have ever looked on Blu Ray. Can't deny that. 4-10 all look pretty killer. Bright colors. Gore looks awesome.

If you are a die hard fan of the series though, eh, it's not that great of a set. First off, 1, 2, 3, the remake, and Freddy vs Jason were already available for purchase. So if you are like me, you may already have some movies in this set. Many people are complaining that 3 is not in true 3D. This is a valid complaint. With movies much less popular getting the conversion, they should have done 3 correctly. Lastly, Jason Goes To Hell doesn't include the unrated version. If this was some rare movie that was hard to get your hands on (think Halloween 6 The Origin of Michael Myers) I could probably understand, but JGTH was always readily available in the uncut format. It was actually harder for me to find the theatrical version, which I finally did way after the release to home video.

These movies no doubt look better than they ever have, and if you haven't picked up any Friday movies in Blu Ray it's probably worth the money. But for die hard fans who may already own some versions of the films on Blu Ray I'm not sure it's worth it at this price.",1382227200,,1218,4.314410480349345

THE BOOK IS NICE, THE BADGE IS OK. THE RED CLIP WITH THE WORDS ""I TOLD THE OTHERS, THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME YOU'LL ALL DOOMED"" FROM CRAZY RALPH,  IS KOOL. I PURCHASED IT BECAUSE OF THE FIRST TIME BLU-RAY RELEASE OF FILMS 4-10. THEY DIDN'T DO A REAL 3D REMASTER FOR PART 3, LIKE SHOUT FACTORY DID FOR AMITYVILLE HORROR, THAT WAS JUST LAZINESS. MOST OF THE FILMS AREN'T TRULY REMASTERED, ONCE AGAIN LAZINESS. THEY JUST BURNT THEM FROM PREVIOUS EDITIONS. SAME GOES FOR THE EXTRAS, INCLUDING THE BONUS DISC. THERE'S NOTHING NEW THERE EITHER.

THE ABSOLUTE WORSE THING ABOUT THIS COLLECTION IS THE CHINTZY PACKAGING THAT HOLDS THE DISK. THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING GOES DOWNHILL. THE EXTREMELY SHODDY CARD-BOARD SLOTS, THAT QUICKLY SCRATCHES THE DISC. THIS MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THE MOVIES IN & OUT OF THE SLOTS. IF WARNER-BROS GAVE A F*** ABOUT THEIR LOYAL JASON FANS, THEY WOULD HAVE PROVIDED INDIVIDUAL SLOTS WITH A SCRATCH-FREE RESISTANT BASE. LIKE THE SOPRANOS: COMPLETE SERIES GIFT SET, TAKE NOTE WARNER-BROS!

OVERALL, IT'S KOOL. I'M HAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE FILMS ARE FINALLY IN ONE COLLECTION & ON BLU-RAY. IF U ALREADY HAVE MOST OF THIS FILMS, YOUR PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE HAPPY WITH THIS COLLECTION. IF U DON'T HAVE THEM, THEN THIS IS GREAT FOR U.",1381968000,,1437,4.67193675889328

5795491,4,B00DEQQK8S,I won't review the movies because everyone already know what the movies are about obviously!!!!This review is about this set!!!!! Collection Contains all 12 Films together for the First Time Ever! At $84.99 Price Point that's ONLY $7.08 Per Movie not bad at all!!!!! There are no new Special Features all the Special Feature are the same as were included in  the Deluxe Edition DVD's! Main advantage is u get each movie on Blu-Ray!!!!!!! Video and Audio quality varies obviously the newer Friday the 13th Movies the Video is better but all the movies look good!!!!! You get a 40 Page Book which is a preview edition of the full book Crystal Lake Memories the Blu-Ray's are in a Book style Packaging inside a Tin CASE and u get a Crystal Lake Counselor Patch and 2 pairs of 3-D glasses!!!!! The Packaging can be a pain with the Cardboard Sleeves which is why I'm giving this set 4 Stars because of the packaging!!!!! Seen a lot of reviews saying the Discs were Damaged but mine every disc was in perfect condition got mine at Best Buy!!!! This Cardboard Packaging seems to be becoming a standard in these box sets! Reason being Movie Studios are getting cheaper and it's cheaper for them to use this type of packaging and they're going to continue to do so they have no intention of changing that at the present time! A Solution I decided on is when I get a set in this type of packaging is I take the Discs out and put them in a CD/DVD Binder and they don't get scratched then I just put the Case on the Shelf! It's a solution anyway to keep the discs from getting scratched! Other than that this set is perfect to me would have been nice for more features but it's still worth the Price for all 12 Movies together on Blu-Ray! Don't expect them to come out with a better set this is clearly the best se of Friday the 13th there has been!!!!!!!,1381881600,,1843,4.388888888888889

Which looks and sounds like the made them today. I love the way that all of them look, part 3 however still has a little dirt on the film and makes it a little weird, but still great. The movies themselves are wonderful I love each part, yeah kind of a bust about JASON GOES TO HELL, but I don't remember the VHS having the UNRATED cut. The original and the remake are the only two that had there extended cuts. The 2009 film does have theatrical cut it is assessable through the special features part of the pop-up menu. For parts 5/6,7/8,9/10 to be on the same disc it doesn't effect playback or quality. All but Parts 1,2,3,and the 2009 are in DTS-HD Master Audio giving you great playback.

And watching the behind the scenes with all the things they (the mpa) cut it makes me believe that they ruined just about every movie when they cut those scenes. It's such a disappointment because they would've been amazing if they just left it alone. And then I read somewhere that the reason they don't make an uncut version on DVD is because they don't have the footage. They lost it somehow. well if u watch the behind the scenes in this box set they show those scenes, so i don't get why they just don't add them in and sell a great box set/movie of it being uncut.",1380153600,2,616,4.228813559322034
5795502,5,B00DEQQK8S,"If you're a fan of the franchise then you'll love this set. Some of the transfers are grainy in a lot of scenes and part 3 has always been known to have the grimy lens debris as if they filmed it in 3D with a budget of $1000.00 I found my self getting really bored watching after the 4th movie. These films aren't very scary when watching them as an adult, and when viewed in order... at least a few films in a row it all seems lazy, uncreative and redundant with almost a sense of boredom taking over. If not for the occasional cute girl these films would induce a coma. They don't even evolve the gore to new nights of creative filming, they just repeat the same cheap hack, cut edits again and again, puncture, camera cut, stab, camera cut, toss through the window, camera cut etc... and the people just die instantly with no human moaning, or gasping as they slowly die, they just get stabbed then suddenly die it's all so unrealistic.

When i was a teen i saw Part 3 with friends at the theater and it was good fun but as an adult most of what i see is a cash exploit going on, budget the films low and hope for maximum easy profits off garbage. I give it high score because it is what it is and these films can be fun around Halloween time but critically these films are pretty worthless.",1379980800,,1294,4.196787148594377

The first boxset which were the regular versions were great for the time the special part of that boxset was the extra disc with deleted scenes and docs which cant be found elsewere not even on deluxe editions. The second boxset ofcourse was the deluxe versions which were enjoyable due to new docs and cut scenes. Now with this set there is nothing new nor special about it, really? No new features No tranfer of previous deleted scenes? Awful tranfer of a scene cut jason goes to hell ,, new begginning and jasonx. I compared the blue rays to the dvds and all three look better on dvd!!!! The final chapter does look somewhat better on bluray. This is blaspemy to treat Jason fans like this please don't buy if you already own these there is nothing to be had except you loosing $110 to corporate people that know nothing about this series or its loyal fans. I will wait until this gets the according treatment on blue ray hopefully shout factory will do it!!! i returned this garbage!!!and so should you.

The only issue I have is Jason Goes To Hell, its Rated R, and its horrible, its choppy, the goriest scenes are cut out. Why wouldnt Paramount or Warner just release that version with the unrated as well? Other than that, its an awesome set, decent for how many movies you get. The plus is the cut out scenes for Part VII. Great movies all around, except the version of JGTH.",1379721600,2,434,4.240963855421687
5795506,5,B00DEQQK8S,"I had to return the first set that I ordered due to the fact that a few of the discs were scratched thus causing skipping and freezing.  Amazon was awesome and they shipped a replacement set out right away.  The second set I received was perfect.  No scratches and the discs play fine.  However, I don't quite understand why companies like Warner Bros keep choosing this type of packaging (book style with cardboard pages with slots the discs slide into) for some of the box sets that are being put out these days. Once these sets are shipped there is obviously some shifting going on with the discs that's causing the scratching.  If they must choose this type of packaging, then do it the right way (i.e  Star Wars blu-ray set, or the Indiana Jones blu-ray set).  All that being said, the set is fantastic if you get your hands on a good copy.  I just wish the discs had been housed in a different way.  Awesome collection, but boo on the packaging.",1379548800,9,951,4.4508670520231215
5795507,3,B00DEQQK8S,"I read in an article somewhere that when the Deluxe editions of this series came out on DVD a couple of years ago, paramount hired a couple of diehard fans to go through the vault and sift through all of the footage for these movies they had, in an attempt to find uncut scenes, or whatever else they could dig up. Unfortunately, it is said that some Paramount exec in the 1990's ordered a lot of the old footage destroyed in order to make more room in their vault, so it is possible that a lot of this footage was lost. Part V was especially affected by this, as virtually none of the old footage remains. Thus, if this is all true, I don't really think you can fault Warner for not giving us what they don't have. (If they DID have it though, I would easily pay up to $500 to have all of these movies uncut. Yeah, I'm a bit of a fanboy for this series :)

That being said, even if there's no uncut versions to include, this box set still comes up way short. I bought the DVD box set from 2004, and although I didn't buy the Deluxe editions, I was lucky enough to have a co-worker who did, and he let me borrow them. I have a policy about not double-dipping on movies and rewarding studios for releasing the same movie(s) multiple times, but had they released all the extras from both DVD sets, even I would've been tempted to pick this up. As it is, they cheaped out and didn't include it all, and the fact that Jason Goes To Hell is the censored version is just inexcusable, esp when the same movie has already been released uncut on DVD. I'm guessing it doesn't have the director commentary from that DVD either, which was actually quite good.

As it is, if you don't own any of the DVD box sets, and you don't care that JGTH has been neutered, this is still a decent buy.",1379548800,3,1776,4.190058479532164
5795508,5,B00DEQQK8S,"From the reviews i have read and watched on youtube I finally decided to go with instinct and get my instant gratification and buy this set. I was pretty impressed with the packaging design and red strap from Crazy Ralph impending DOOM!!!!
Let's first start off with the Uncut and Theatrical cuts of the films. The first Friday the 13th IS UNCUT!!! Plus for me!!!! The third movie is in 3D and does provide cool red and blue 3D Glasses!!! The only film that is not Uncut is Jason Goes To Hell but your not really missing much as far as content.
The rest of the films looked fine when i tested each disc in my blu ray player. None of them skipped and the packaging is very similar to The Indiana Jones Blu ray set packaging so as a major fan of this series i give it 5 stars!!!",1379462400,2,776,4.18
5795509,5,B00DEQQK8S,"I am so thrilled.!
To have all of the Jason films together in one set on Blu-Ray.
So far the A/V presentation is very good on all of the discs.
I had always felt when I upgraded to BD.
That I had downgraded my Jason movie collection slightly.
Now they're all together in on box set
.
Horro'rs my favorite genre.
However I do like all kinds of films.
Thanks Warner Brothers for doing this.!!!!!!
Thanks Paramount. For giving WB access all  to those films.!!!!!!!!
This is the best thing ever.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1379462400,3,547,5.010989010989011
5795510,4,B00DEQQK8S,"Finally received this most sought after blu-ray in my collection.
Here is a little break down.

The Pros:

-All of the films in one boxset with great  transfers
-Very nice collectible tin case with a some accessories making it more fun to handle
-Almost every extra special feature previously released from other releases,
including all of the cut footage which still exists in the vaults of Paramount.

The Cons:

-There is no original posters on each slipholder and just in the boxset overall
-6 of the 12 films share discs which i don't iike even if it doesn't bother the transfers for each film.
-The disc menus does not have the same style throughout which is a stylistic deviation.
-There is no original soundtrack for part 4-8 but they get a good remastered audio.
-Friday the 13th part 3 is lacking a polarized 3D transfer and the anaglyph transfer is unwatchable
-Jason Goes to Hell doesn't have the unrated cut
- No original friday the 13th logo on the cover
- They used one specific Jason to grace the artwork rather than a more neutral artwork
that goes for all of the movies unless if it would have been my favorite part 4 Jason
- On each slipholder there is no information on what special features are included for each movie

Conclusion:

Great set that has almost everything but it could have been perfect with the unrated version of Jason goes to hell
and a proper 3D transfer for part 3.. I am one happy camper and highly recommend it!",1379376000,11,1453,4.565384615384615

They even go further and make a collectable tin box and the discs are kept safely in a thoughtfully designed book-like case.

Perfect for anyone who has always wanted to own all the films but never got around to it.",1379203200,5,322,4.262295081967213
5795513,4,B00DEQQK8S,"In MY opinion, this was better than the last one with the mask for a big major reason...
If you do your research on blogs, thousands (including myself) of fans got their DVD box set and sooner or later the glue came apart and the disc would fall between the disc and ruin the disc completely. 3 pages on my box set came apart and destroyed my movie disc, but on this set, the booklet is more professionally made.
It comes with a band to hold the book together with the quote: I told the others, they didn't believe me... You're all doomed!  2 pairs of the red&blue 3D glasses, a patch that says Camp Crystal Lake Counselor on it, and a 40 page book. Inside the tin box is fantastic art of a character in water screaming which is nice. On the back is a dark glossy print of a pier over a lake. If you get it, be sure to check out the extra on Jason lives for the mystery of Jason's Dad.
Is it worth it? Well, do the math. 12 films on Blu-Ray= about $7.41 a movie (I paid $89 for it at Best Buy).Not to mention you can't find all of them on Blu-Ray.",1379116800,5,1047,4.009569377990431
5795514,4,B00DEQQK8S,"Warner Bros Home Entertainment has done what many thought was impossible. For the first time ever, they've compiled every ""Friday the 13th"" film into one package. Why did it seem like such an impossible feat? Simply because several different studios owned the movies as the franchise was passed from one to another over the years. I don't care how it happened. I'm just rejoicing in the fact that I have them all together... and now in high-definition no less!

There have been complaints that ""Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection"" doesn't include the uncut versions of some of the films along with other minor issues. Honestly, I really don't care. It's good enough for me to have them the way they were originally released. What do the uncut versions have that the theatrical ones don't? An extra boob or graphic slashing scene? I'm really alright without those. Each of the movies stand on their own merits as is.

All 12 of the movies in the series are found in the ""Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection."" You get the uncut versions of the original film and its 2009 remake, the 9 sequels, and ""Freddy vs. Jason."" ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" is presented in 3-D. Obviously, each movie varies in quality. Although the first one is my favorite, I will say that I enjoy them all for what they are.

""Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection"" comes housed in a textured tin box featuring Jason holding a machete on the front. A hardcover book/sleeve contains all 12 of the movies. Each cardboard page features accompanying stills on them. Some of them have little blurbs of behind-the-scenes info. It also includes a 40-page booklet with excerpts from ""Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th."" Two pairs of 3-D glasses and a Camp Crystal Lake Counselor patch are found as well. All of these items are bundled together by a stretchable red band that reads, ""I told the others. They didn't believe me. You're all doomed.""

The audio and video for ""Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection"" varies in quality. Some of the original source materials obviously limit how well each movie looks on Blu-ray. The newer ones were made knowing they were going to be released at some point on Blu-ray and/or DVD. The older ones look brighter and cleaner, but still have some visual imperfections. The sound brings the woods around Camp Blood and the streets and back alleys of Manhattan to life. Let's not forget to mention how spectacular Harry Manfredini's score for the movies sound thanks to this hi-def upgrade.

There are loads of special features for each disc. There's also an entire DVD entitled ""Killer Bonus."" They come with audio commentary, making of documentaries, featurettes, and other odds and ends. Many consumers have complained that all the extra material has been released before. At least now it's all in one place.

People who always see the glass as half empty will always be around. I tend to look at ""Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection"" in a positive light. How can you complain as a fan of this franchise when we're finally getting all the movies in Blu-ray and they're housed in one convenient set? I recommend this for any fans of Jason and his franchise that can look past a few flaws and just enjoy it for the gift it is.",1379116800,19,3275,4.757042253521127
5795515,5,B00DEQQK8S,I have been a huge fan of this franchise for a long time. When I saw they were doing the entire collection on Blu-ray I was pretty excited. The movies hold up for sure and they did a great job with packaging.,1379116800,3,208,3.9761904761904763
5795516,1,B00DEQQK8S,"I got this set at Best Buy for $89 on release day (9/13/13) and, upon taking it home, noticed 7 of the 10 discs were scratched. This was not a result of my removing them from the packaging, which requires you to slide them out of cardboard sleeves. The discs actually came out with no resistance, but they were still scratched. When part 7 started skipping scenes, I took it back to Best Buy for an exchange.

When they exchanged it, the manager had me open the new one in the store at the counter to check the discs. This set was even MORE damaged than my previous one, but the manager said I should at least take it home and try it out because the scratches on this one might be superficial and not affect playback. I decided to be a good sport, so I followed his advice. Well, guess what? The movies skipped again.

I took the set back for the second time and got the last copy my local Best But store had to do an exchange. Upon performing the exchange again, I was asked to inspect the set. We got to disc 4 and sure enough, there was a huge scratch straight across the disc. The manager said the entire batch must have issues and that all I could do at that point was contact Warner Bros. themselves. I asked for a refund, but apparently their policy is to give out gift cards for returned movies instead of cash refunds. So not wanting to go through this a fourth time, I took the gift card. So now I have a $97 Best Buy gift card and no Friday the 13th Blu-ray set. This is really disappointing, as I wanted this set badly. I guess I wasn't meant to own it.

I uploaded a picture of one of the scratched discs in the customer images section, and this actually ended up being one of the BETTER discs. This set has a serious quality control problem and people need to know about this. In my opinion, the whole set needs to be be recalled. I went through THREE damaged sets--that is inexcusable for a brand new product.

I am only happy that I purchased mine from an actual store so the exchanges were easier. If I had to send the set back to an online retailer twice, I would have been even more upset over the wasted time. Warner, you guys are getting back ALL of my local Best Buy's sets because they are all damaged. Maybe when the sets are returned, you guys will take a hint and never make another set with this sort of packaging again.

Too bad--I really wanted these movies on Blu-ray.",1379030400,51,2398,4.215686274509804
5795517,5,B00DEQQK8S,"First off people should just be happy the studios finally released this series on Blu-Ray. Part 1 is uncut.  Part 2 (in 2D) &3 in 3D are the same discs they released just with different art work on them.  One thing you get they don't tell you is a red strap that goes around the box set that says ""I told the others, They didn't believe me You're all doomed"". The only thing I could be a little mad about is they double up movies on discs, but once again people should be happy with what they got.
It would of been nice since they announced they are doing Friday 2 if they would have put a slot in box set for that.",1379030400,3,615,3.991869918699187
5795518,3,B00DEQQK8S,"This is a must have for ""Friday"" fans however those fans will be disappointed in this release I know I was (and still am). I want everyone to know they if you think you are getting new bonus features or a new ""Documentary"" think again there not here!  There is nothing new. The transfers should of been much better.  I know the source material might not be in the best shape but come-on these films are evergreens and produce new fans daily.  New Mastering would of paid for itself/  Now that HD is everywhere remastering is a must.  Also a new documentary would of paid for itself as well.  You could of sold it to cable channels...

 Paramount and Warner Brothers should of also recreated some the deleted scenes of gore in all new documentary.  It would of not cost that much money to make a documentary about the ""Gore effects"" and then had them re-shoot these scenes.  Body doubles could of been used for the actors and the whole thing would of cost less money then an average television episode.  On top of that they would of have a awesome documentary that would of been a must have for ""Friday"" fans.  Plus those re-created scenes could of been included in ""ALL NEW EDITIONS"" of each film.  The fans would of loved it and the Studio would have in effect new films to re-sell to cable showings.  For the first 8 films the investment would of paid for itself fast and millions of blu-rays would of been sold!

Another lost opportunity is the fact they could of given us new audio commentary's on this release. Yes some audio commentary's were not that old but it would of been great to have something new added.

Another lost moment from this release is that they could of included mini posters of each film.  Each film could of had its own poster and on the back it could of had ""TRIVIA"" ""FILM FACTS"" or just even the information on the blu ray release. Like chapter marks and who is on the audio commentary and when it was recorded.

I would not rule out a future major release on these films.  There is still plenty of things that can and should be done for a home video release.

PS I KNOW A 7 HOUR DOCUMENTARY IS BEING RELEASED HOWEVER I STILL THINK PARAMOUNT AND WARNER BROTHERS SHOULD OF DONE MORE WITH THIS SET.  AT  $125 fans will feel cheated",1378944000,4,2258,4.390361445783133
5795519,1,B00DEQQK8S,"Like others have said. It is a real shame warner is not making part 3 in real 3d. That was one of the best 3d films i have ever seen. If this boxset came with a real 3d copy i would have paid over $100 for the set easy. But there is nothing new to this set at all and is even more sad that a much lower budget company like shout factory can take out the time to make ammityville 3 in real 3d but Warner doesnt want to bother.

Plus there nothing about this set you cant already get(for cheaper) any ways. Except parts 4-10 are now on blu ray. I will just stick with my dvd set until warner gets there act together and gives the fans a better blu ray set to offer.",1378857600,7,663,3.8394160583941606
5795520,3,B00DEQQK8S,"This is a nice grouping. This is a bit of a high price for a very large amount of movies, wait a year and you will most likely get this at a much lower price tag. I love these movies and I want to give this five stars as a fanboy but my intention here it to be fair to the people who expect more from this series. I am going to try to fully outline each portion of this set in an impartial way in order to let you know what this set Comes with. This has all of the movies wich makes it a 5 star, but we still aren't getting complete uncut sets, though this may never happen. For this I am resting on a neutral three.

What's missing: The audio commentary from the 2004 From Crystal Lake to Manhattan box set. Now this is where the laziness starts kicking in. Because you'll see further down that Warner is, in fact, including some of the other commentaries from that 2004 set. So what this comes down to is not wanting to create a new Blu-ray when they can re-use the old release

Who knows.

Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday

R Rated, Theatrical Release
Commentary by Adam Marcus and Dean Lorey
TV Version Alternate Scenes
What's here: The same supplements from the old New Line DVD. Curiously, this alleges to be the R-rated theatrical cut. If true, this is the most catastrophic oversight of the entire set.

Friday the 13th Chronicles: Part I - VIII
Secrets Galore Behind The Gore (3 Part Featurette)
Original Trailers - Part I - VIII
What's here: This is the bonus disc from the 2004 release. In the wake of the incoming Crystal Lake Memories documentary, this is going to look like a shoddier effort than it already is.

The packaging is lame and for some reason they chose to use Jason Goes To Hell to advertise this.

Forget all of the above though. If you purchase this you will get a patch. Yup, a patch.",1378857600,136,7165,4.895867768595041
5795521,1,B00DEQQK8S,"I would have bought this JUST to get Part 3 in proper Blu-Ray 3D- I am a 3D fan from way back, have had a 3D TV for a year now and love it but have been disappointed at the lack of classic 3D movies released so far. Part 3 was originally released on Blu-Ray before the Blu-Ray 3D format was finalized, so instead they used the silly red-and-blue format with cardboard glasses which messes up the color and induces headaches. (Anyone seen Disney's 3D promo with Timon and Pumbaa, where they say ""Throw 'em out""?) Rather than re-doing the disc the RIGHT way, they just threw the old disc in this set! This is a slap in the face to those of us who have invested in 3D at home!

Part 3's best home video release was on the Japanese VHD videodisc format, a 3rd videodisc format from the 1980s that never made it to the US. That format had a number of 3D titles in field-sequential 3D, which still wasn't perfect but looked much better than the awful red and blue format. Field-sequential 3D however will not work on modern HDTVs.",1378684800,10,1024,4.305699481865285
5795522,1,B00DEQQK8S,"I just cancelled my preorder now that I've seen the lack of new features.  Seriously, these movies were all low-budget affairs and will look just as good on my upscaled DVDs.  What I wanted was a celebration of F13!  Are you listening, Warner?  I expect a lot more for this price.  Look at the Alien quadrilogy.  It's now going for the price of a single blu ray.  I see that fate on the horizon for this set as well.  I can wait.",1378684800,5,429,4.146341463414634
5795523,1,B00DEQQK8S,"Paramount & WB have been sitting on this franchise for decades since the initial home video releases & have failed miserably to do anything remotely decent with it. Apart from giving the original 1980 film an uncensored release (which has always been available here in Australia through WB i might add). I think it's time they step aside & let another releasing company do something worthwhile with it (like Shout Factory for example, who are putting everyone else to shame at the moment). Most of the reviews have already covered what's wrong with this set. At first glance, the presentation alone is a pretty good reflection of the kind of sloppy non effort involved here. The biggest slap in the face with this boxset however, is not just the lack of new content (particularly for parts 2 & 3), the poor artwork & presentation, or the MPAA butchered versions of the films from the same old masters the DVDs were transfered from. But the repackaging of the woeful & painfully unwatchable anaglyph (red/blue) 3D version of the third film. It was not filmed or intended for anaglyph & is a very poor representation of what the film originally was theatrically. With the 3D technology available for the home arena now, it seems insane to repackage a cheap, ineffective, poorly executed conversion again.
It's absurd to think that their most lucrative B movie franchise, that is now a monumental pop culture staple, is getting such lack luster treatment & is pretty much all just repackaged content from 10 to 15 years ago.
Apart from the blurays for parts 1, 2 & 3. I haven't bought anything since the Crystal Lake To Manhattan boxset... for good reason. And i have absolutely no intention what so ever in doing so, until someone gets hold of these & does something right for once.
This set however is beyond a farce. Do yourself a huge favor. Save your money for the Crystal Lake Memories documentary.",1378252800,8,1901,4.763636363636364

And I have part 3 on blu-ray (because it contains some bonus features not previously included on the deluxe dvd).
If you have all of those, you have no new bonus features to look forward to and unless you're a blu-ray junkie, I see no reason whatsoever to buy this collection.  I'm sure they will come out with yet another series of F13 blu-ray releases sometime in the near future which will hopefully contain some new material that we haven't seen before.
So why am I considering shelling out the money to buy this?
BECAUSE IT CONTAINS AN EMBROIDERED CRYSTAL LAKE PATCH!!!
That's the only thing in this set I want.
It's sad really.
I'm actually considering buying this entire waste of shelf space for a patch.
A 90 dollar embroidered patch.
God, help me.
Anyone with an idea of how I can get the patch without buying the box set, please let me know.
That would be much appreciated.

5795526,4,B00DEQQK8S,"There are a lot of bad reviews about this set. Some are legitimate complaints but most of them are not a big deal to me. I haven't heard anything that would deter me from buying this.

complaints that don't bother me.

""Part 3 not being true 3D""-Is this really that big a deal for most people. I personally don't own a 3D tv and have no intention of buying one anytime soon. I don't know anyone who does have one. Do that many people really have them. I could care less if part 3 is true 3D or not.

""No new special features""-I consider 7 films being released in Blu ray format for the first time a special feature. It's the main reason i am getting this set. Also i never got the previously released DVD set so the killer extra's disc is new to me.

""Parts 5-10 2 movies per disc""-This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I've gotten a few double feature Blu ray discs that are fine. I just recently bought When a stranger calls and Happy birthday to me on one Blu ray disc. The audio and video on both are very impressive.

""The price""-Roughly 95 dollars for 12 films. Basically your getting 12 films on Blu ray for less than 10 dollars apiece. How is that not a good deal.

complaints i agree with.

""Part 1 and JGTH not being uncut""-This is a slap in the face to fans. Considering these movies have already been released uncut it seems unfair to not include them. This is the only thing that really bothers me. It's why i put 4 stars instead of 5. I will still get this set though.

""No commentary's for parts 2 and 3""-No commentary for part 2 was ever done but a commentary for part 3 does exist. I don't understand why it wasn't included here.

UPDATE-I guess it's been confirmed that part 1 is the uncut version. JGTH however is the theatrical version.",1378080000,6,1754,4.2749244712990935
5795527,1,B00DEQQK8S,"After much consideration, i have decided to pass on this much anticipated box set. Warner Bros. is clearly in it for a quick buck and have targeted the desperate and/or casual horror fans. Besides the fact that 3 isn't really 3D, or the fact that we have been denied the uncut versions, WB has a lot of nerve charging $95 for this set. I'm sticking with my deluxe editions and holding off until another company comes along and gives us PROPER releases.",1377820800,9,452,4.524390243902439
5795528,5,B00DEQQK8S,"Now a quick review/rundown of each of the films.

FRIDAY THE 13th (1980) - This is where it all began, and even though at the time the film felt like a second-rate HALLOWEEN rip-off, this original film holds up much better than you would think. It's much scarier, sparse and spookier than many of the films that followed. It has a simplicity to it that has allowed it to age gracefully over time. It's also one of only two films in the franchise doesn't feature Jason as the killer (the other being A NEW BEGINNING which features a fake Jason).

FRIDAY THE 13th PART II (1981) - Out of all the other films, this is the closest in spirit to the original. It's also the first time Jason became the actual killer in the franchise. The characters are likable (and a good thing too, because you want to care about the people who are going to die) and it has an ample amount of suspense and gore.

FRIDAY THE 13th PART 3D (1982) - Another solid effort, though this 3D film began to bring a little more camp into the proceedings (and I'm not talking about Camp Crystal Lake). This one feels more dated with the hippies and the bikers, but it does try to do a slight variation on the story and you can't fault the film that finally introduced Jason's trademarked hockey mask.

FRIDAY the 13th: THE FINAL CHAPTER (1984) - A noble failure, as it tries to conclude the franchise, but doesn't, really, because eight more movies followed after it). By this time, the franchise feels like it's merely an excuse to randomly kill teenagers than hinge an actual story to it, even though Corey Feldman's Tommy Jarvis is an interesting protagonist. It was the worst of the films up until JASON TAKES MANHATTAN unseated it and then JASON GOES TO HELL unseated that after it.

FRIDAY the 13th PART V: A NEW BEGINNING (1985) - The franchise continues to slide downhill with a fake-out movie with a surprise twist that pissed off many FRIDAY fans (myself included). Points to the producers for trying to do something different, points taken away for failing to make it work.

JASON LIVES: FRIDAY THE 13th PART VI (1986) - He's back, the man behind the mask in one of the most entertaining sequels of the franchise so far. The movie is way meta, before meta was even acknowledged in cinema as it finally solved the FRIDAY story dilemma - having two consecutive storylines happening at once. You have the Jason A-story of killing random people and teenagers, while the B-story is Tommy Jarvis trying to get to Crystal Lake to stop Jason from killing people. It works well, and the dark humor is the only time humor has fully worked in one of these movies successfully.

FRIDAY THE 13th PART VII - THE NEW BLOOD (1987) - Another attempt at reinventing the franchise, this time with Jason squaring off against a telekinetic teenager. It's another solid effort with some nice twists and a great blending of the slasher genre with more fantasy elements.

FRIDAY THE 13th PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN (1989) - I bet Paramount was ruing the day they decided to use roman numerals to identify the FRIDAY films with this one, because it was getting way too bulky by this time.  Again, an out-of-the-box idea, but it fails miserably because it doesn't deliver. Over half of the movie takes place on a boat with the latter half barely having any real New York in it to make it the Big Apple gorefest it should have been. There are a few choice moments, but like PART 3D, it feels horribly dated.

JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY (1993) - Neck and neck with JASON TAKES MANHATTAN as the worst FRIDAY film as New Line takes over the franchise. Adding a supernatural element completely changes who and what Jason is and it was a huge mistake. It's asinine and completely neutered the simplicity and beauty of Jason. Though, I have to admit, I am fond of the twist fake-out that opens the movie. Still, Jason is a killer, not a supernatural entity, and, when will these films learn to stop using the word ""Final"" when it comes to the FRIDAY THE 13th franchise? Three more followed. How is that final?

JASON X (2002) - Almost ten years after THE FINAL FRIDAY, Jason is sent into space in what could have been an absolute travesty, but the end result is actually quite good. It plays up not only science-fiction tropes, but also Jason in general. It has an ample amount of humor and freshens up the franchise, even though many would have probably preferred a more old-fashioned slasher movie throwback.

FREDDY VS. JASON (2004) - It took way too long, but New Line finally paired up horror's biggest baddies in a pretty entertaining mash-up. Though, I was never too thrilled to have Jason and Freddy's back stories linked up, the rest of the movie gives us the best of both worlds - surreal, nightmarish dream sequences and old fashioned Jason kills. This is probably the most expensive installment in either of the franchises (outside of the recent remakes of both installments).

FRIDAY THE 13th (2009) - At long last, FRIDAY THE 13th is rebooted, and ends up feeling like ... a sequel to FRIDAY THE 13th. I liked the new film, though director Marcus Nispel was probably not the best choice to helm this installment. It would be wonderful if an actual FRIDAY fan who also happened to be a director, was hired to helm the ultimate FRIDAY movie, but that's not the case here. The story is actually quite solid and remixes the first three movies in the franchise into this new film. All the tropes are here, gore, girls and graphic violence. It's a shame a follow-up wasn't greenlit fast enough. After all, the next movie will be FRIDAY THE 13th: PART 13!

As for THE COMPLETE COLLECTION, this set doesn't mean you can throw away your previous box sets, but it is a nice, comprehensive one-stop shopping for all the films on Blu-ray. And if you don't own a complete set yet, this is definitely worth buying. For all other FRIDAY fans, proceed with caution (though, come on, admit it, you were going to buy this thing anyway for the Crystal Lake Counselor patch).",1377734400,,6030,4.581632653061225
5795529,5,B00DEQQK8S,Ok i see that the stars on this is only 2 and a half wtf friday the 13th is one of the best horror films every made,1377734400,,115,3.2962962962962963
5795530,1,B00DEQQK8S,"For so many years horror fans have always speculated what it would be like to get an ultra box set containing each and every entry of the Friday the 13th film series in one collection. For many years this has been a legal impossibility due to Paramount Pictures owning the first eight and New Line Cinema owning the rest. Back in the VHS and DVD hey days, companies did not know how to cooperate on amazing releases as they have finally learned with releases such as this collection.

For the first time ever, each and every Friday the 13th film is packaged together in a collection fit for a fright night horror movie marathon.

Friday the 13th (1980) comes to us in it's unrated edition. It is the same exact film as the one we have been watching on VHS and DVD for years, except the murders have been extended to show off more blood, fit for the post Kill Bill generation of film goers.

As a matter of fact, the first three films in the franchise are an exact re-release of the three Blu-ray releases that were previously released by Paramount. They look and sound spectacular in HD. The beginning parts of Part 3 seemed very grainy, but that added to the feel of the film, being an early 80s slasher. Part 3's 3D is nothing to write home about.

All of the films in this collection have a level of visual clarity never before seen in a Friday the 13th film.

My first complaint with this set is the lack of an unrated cut of Jason Goes to Hell. Every fan has voiced an opinion on that issue. Sure, you can obtain the digital copy of it, but we want it on hard copy disc. If you still have your Jason Goes to Hell DVD which offered both cuts of the film, keep it.

Now for the bad news. The box set itself is the worst I have ever purchased. The horrible cardboard packaging damages the discs. My Part 5/6 disc does not even work. That is unacceptable knowing how much people pay for a collection like this. After this experience (and my experience with the Universal Monster box set), I will never EVER purchase a box set with cardboard book page disc holders ever again!

Paramount's 2004 Crystal Lake to Manhattan DVD release is STILL the best Friday the 13th box set ever made. The reason for that is, is because I purchased it on release date, and all of my discs still work perfectly. The reason is that the packaging is made to protect those discs.",1376870400,,2359,4.347727272727273
5795531,3,B00DEQQK8S,"Despite this 12 film, 10-disc (9 BD & 1 DVD) set containing the entire Friday the 13th film canon it isn't much of an upgrade from previous DVD sets. There has never been a truly comprehensive set with extras for this film series on VHS, DVD or Blu-Ray and this is no exception. You do get Blu-Ray versions of Friday 4 through Jason X that haven't been released yet (the others are already for sale individually). This collection is a mixed bag because even though there is nothing wrong it could have been so much better. Admittedly all box sets have their limitations. It's hard to believe twelve F13 films get only 10 discs when five Superman films command 8 discs. Since there is so much material in the franchise this set could have been amazing.

A partial list of positive benefits of this release:
- One of only four horror film franchises to get a complete collection (Scream, The Exorcist, Child's Play). Freddy only got 7 of 9 films in a 5 BD collection.
- More special features and bonuses than some other film franchises (such as the Rambo, Rocky and Robocop Blu-ray collections).
- NEW 7 F13 films (Friday 4 to Jason X) are making their Blu-ray debut.
- 5 F13 films (Friday the 13th 1-3, Freddy vs. Jason, Friday the 13th remake) are included (also sold separately).
- 11 hours of previously released extras (making the movies) is included.
- 40-page booklet featuring excerpts from Crystal Lake Memories.
- NEW Official Camp Crystal Lake counselor embroidered patch (iron-on).

A partial list of negative limitations of this release:
- No new extras. The bonus disc is recycled content from the 2004 Crystal Lake to Manhattan DVD box set & reboot BD. 9 years is a long wait.
- No uncut versions of the films except the original and reboot (forget JGTH). Each film has at least 10 seconds to several minutes of cut footage that only seems to be available for purchase separately.
- The picture and audio quality vary by film. Overall, I rate them both 3.5/5. The Final Chapter looks and sounds the worst. The reboot gets the best treatment.
- Part 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 (Jason X) do not get their own disc (they are included in pairs). None of these are the extended/deluxe versions.
- No commentaries for F13 Part 2 or 3. The extras for F13 Part 5, 9 and 10 are fairly limited. Not all extras are ported over from previous releases.
- Friday the 13th Part 3D is anaglyph not true 3D.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amityville-Horror-Trilogy-Blu-ray/dp/B00DOZNF1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amityville Horror Trilogy [Blu-ray</a>] remastered the third film for Blu-ray 3D!
- 3 Alice Cooper Music Videos from Friday the 13th Part 6 aren't included. ""He's Back - The Man Behind the Mask"" was a hit.
- Daniel Farrand's ""His Name Was Jason (2009)"" documentary is not included. Likewise the 30-minute featurette, ""The Crystal Lake Massacres Revisited (2009)"".
- The included booklet, Crystal Lake Memories, is a bonus but only a shadow of the original book on which it is based.

I would rate the films 4 stars and this collection 3 stars. It's still the best complete collection available for F13 in any format. If you don't own these films on DVD this set may be a worthwhile purchase but hardcore fans won't find new material here. Almost half of the films in this set already have better Blu-Ray and DVD releases so hang onto the deluxe versions. The verdict is that the F13 collection is complete but not comprehensive. Many fans expect at least 2-4 hours of new material in any Blu-ray release along with remastered extended versions. Friday the 13th fans may also be interested in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crystal-Lake-Memories-The-Complete-History-Of-Friday-The-13th-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00ETHN9L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History Of Friday The 13th (Blu-ray + DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;which is an excellent 400-minute documentary on the making of the franchise. Including it here would make this collection a truly great purchase. This is the ""Indiana Jones"" of slashers after all! My favorite kill of the series was Crispin Glover being used as a human cork by Jason. Ultimately every fan will decide for themselves if the upgrade is appropriate for them. One more thing: The UV digital copy of Jason Goes to Hell is unrated (but not the disc).

5795532,1,B00DEQQK8S,"Well, horror fans we are treated to another half-assed collection. Let's recap before we go forward. There were releases on DVD in 2001 that were bare bones with re imagined artwork for parts 5-8. Then there was a box set in 2004 with an extra disc of footage, but you had to buy the set to get the extras which was a middle finger to the people who bought the single discs. Another box set was put out in 2011 this time with an Anaglyph 3D version of part 3 and some remastering that SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THE FIRST TIME. Parts 1-3 were released on Blu-Ray still again without the original artwork. It's almost like they don't even try.
With the new set they could not be bothered to provide anything worth while with this set. Anyone who will be shelling out 100 dollars for this probably owns the DVDs, so offering something special in the way of content would be smart. But Warner continues the tradition of double or quadruple dipping with this set. You can see the specs in other reviews, I won't be buying this because one the new sequel comes out in a few years they will release this a 5th time with footage that was lost for 30 years. I'll buy the set when people that actually know the genre put it together.",1376784000,17,1219,4.327510917030568
5795533,4,B00DEQQK8S,"Lets Get To The Facts About This Set.

No Viable Uncut Footage Exsists For All Friday Films Except, 1 Scene From Friday The 13th (1980) & Jason Goes To Hell (1993) Unrated, Which Clocks In At An Extra 5 Mins Of Gore Footage Approx.

The Remaster Of All The Films Will Look Amazing They Have Used The AVC MPEG-4 Codec For The HD Transfer Which Is The Latest & Newest & Best Coding Available.

2 Films Per Blu-Ray Disc Will Not Degrade The Picture Or Sound For Any Of These Films As Most Friday Films Clock In At 90 Mins They Only Use Approx 20gb Per Movie And As They Are All On Duel Layer 50gb Blu Ray Discs They Fit 2 Films Easily.

If You Want To Hate A Company For No Uncut Footage Hate Paramount Pictures For Disposing Of The Material Instead Of Keeping It For Home Video Releases.

Warner Brothers Can Be Blamed For The Theatrical Version Of Jason Goes To Hell. That Is Piss Poor IMO.

Warner Brothers Are The Reason We Are Getting A Full HD Blu-Ray Release Of The Entire Friday The 13th Series.

Some People Have Received Their Copies To The Collection And It Is Confirmed That Friday The 13th (1980) Is The Uncut Version. And Jason Goes To Hell (1993) Is The Theatrical Version. Friday The 13th Part III Is (Anaglyph 3D) With 2 Pairs Of RED/BLUE Glasses.

These Films In Their R Rated Editions Will Look Amazing On Blu Ray And At US$95 For 12 Feature Films On 9 Blu-Ray Discs, I Consider That To Be Dirt Cheap.

Also Warner Brothers Blu-Ray Discs Are Region Free So If Your Like Me And Are In Australia (Region B) You Can Get This Set Priority Express To Australia For AU$120.

I'm aware that we may not get the unrated cuts of part 1 or of Jason Goes to Hell, but is not getting the uncut version of part 1 really that much to gripe about? IT'S ONLY 10 SECONDS PEOPLE! 10 SECONDS! Not much to miss. The differences between the rated and unrated version of Jason Goes to Hell are drastic and noticeable and that's the only problem i have with this set. As far as any extras being new, don't really care because anyone that is buying this set I imagine is also buying the Crystal Lake Memories 7 hour documentary as well.

Seriously, look up ""Friday The 13th"" on here to see just how many times they've put out the same movies with no added incentives except box art that just keeps getting more and more garish and further away from the classic poster art and title logos that we were so fond of back in the 80s.  I say just stop buying this crap and maybe they'll take the hint and finally shell out some money to throw at these films the same way they expect us to.  They'll only take advantage of us as much we'll let them.  Well, not me and not anymore.  I will not pay them for crap products and I will do whatever I can to spread the word.  I hope others follow suit as well.

W7II has written an amazingly in-depth review of everything that is wrong with this set.  I implore all of you to read his review/warning before you give any serious consideration (or your hard earned money) to this set.",1373068800,47,1529,4.421428571428572
5795546,5,B00DEQQK8S,"Everyone can complain how its just like the DVD boxset, but the fact remains that there are many people who do no own the films on DVD and have waited for a blu-ray release. Personally, I fall into this category and I'm glad to own the series on blu-ray. As for all the complaining about 3D, are there really THAT many people out there with 3D TVs and players that this is a big deal? It seems to be falling on the wayside, so why should they spend the money on a feature that the majority (note, majority, not all) consumers aren't even going to use? There's also the complaining about the lack of uncut versions. That would be a great feature, if it were at all possible, but considering how much footage was lost, quite frankly its not (although if the first film is not released Uncut, that is a bit of a puzzler since the first blu-ray release was unct. Perhaps there is a copyright issue on that specific cut, but that would just be conjecture on my part). At this point I'm just glad there is finally a boxset with all the films, many of which are on the format for the first time.",1372896000,5,1088,4.260869565217392

5795548,1,B00DEQQK8S,"I cancelled my order before it was too late. I've read that JGTH is only the R rated version. NO WAY! Not when it has been already released as unrated. I cud care less about them not doing part 3 in real 3d, but the lack of an unrated version of JGTH is a deal breaker for me. IF YOU HAVE THE FIRST 3 ON BLU-RAY, DELUXE EDITION DVD's for pts 4-8, JGTH unrated DVD, Jason X DVD, Freddy vs Jason Blu-ray, and FT13th 2009 remake on Blu-ray, just keep what you have. They will be more than enough to keep you satisfied. The deluxe DVD's actually look really good upconverted too. The packaging sucks for this set also. Your discs cud get scratched. For the problems this set has and what it is lacking, this set is not anywhere near the $90 selling price. I wud maybe pay half the price. Hopefully they will sell the movies individually on Blu-ray in the future. It may be better to pick up the rest individually and avoid this overpriced worthless stinker of a set. You can also get this set for $84.99 at [...] which is currently the cheapest price I've seen right now.",1372809600,14,1067,4.261083743842365

5795550,1,B00DEQQK8S,"I was initially excited when I heard that F13th would be released in a boxset with ALL 12 films, but my hopes were shattered once I read that only the R-rated versions of the films will be released. This is completely unacceptable. There are allready two different boxset s, numerous releases of the single disks, and there are unrated versions available on DVD. I geuss the patch that comes with this boxset must be made from some amazingly high quality material, because I don't understand why weas fansare expected to buy a boxset for $130.00 and not get unrated versions of at least the previous unrated films. The bonus disk is also just a copy of the bonus disk from the previous boxset. There is nothing new included in this boxset other than 1080p, a lame camp counselor patch, a 40 page snippet from a book on the series, a ""collective"" tin case, and the horrible new artwork, that honestly looks likes they took a still frame from Jason goes to hell. I feel convinced that their cash cow is dying and they're the ones who are killing it. . .",1372550400,35,1051,4.507853403141361
