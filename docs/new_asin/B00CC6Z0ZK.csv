5714249,4,B00CC6Z0ZK,I guess this set is good for die hard fans wanting the boxed set altogether but for anyone who isn't I'm not sure it would be worth the money spent.....I kinda expected some extra content or something but there was just the movies as I'd you bought them separately so as I said its acceptable to me because I'm a die hard fan of the games and movies,1358553600,,349,4.147058823529412

5714252,5,B00CC6Z0ZK,"They're ridiculous, they know it, and they don't give a damn what you think. In point of fact, they prefer if you don't think.

Let's get one thing straight, I am a huge fan of the game series. I own Resident Evil 1-5, and I'm probably going to buy 6 soon. I am fully aware that these movies deviate from the games in every way, but for some reason I still love them. They're dumb, stupid fun.

Resident Evil is actually a great movie in and of itself. It's suspenseful, and well made. I appreciate the fact that zombies and other monsters aren't introduced till late in the movie.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse is actually my favorite of the bunch. It's a good action movie, and I think they really captured Nemesis. Great movie, and awesome action.

Resident Evil: Extinction is a little slow, but is ultimately a good movie. The story of this series has never been cohesive, but the plot of this one in particular is just ridiculous. At this point the movies have become self aware and every subsequent sequel is even more bombastic and ridiculous. Awesome...

Resident Evil: Afterlife is a little weird. Kind of strangely paced, but still a solid action movie. I love how they don't even try to explain how the zombies got Las Plagas virus. Just go with it.

Resident Evil: Retribution. Holy hell. What a strange ride. It's a top notch comedy, I'll say that much. I, personally really liked this movie. It's just so... ridiculous. Like I said, these movies have become self aware, and are now just trying to one up each other. This one does a hell of a job.

Milla Jovovich is hamming it up with every single movie. It's really funny. She's always this hardcore action star with a little bit of an emotional side. I also think she's just gorgeous, so that's alright.

These movies aren't oscar winning classics. They're like every cheesy 80's action flick that you love. Keep that in mind if you are looking to buy these films. As for this collection, they are all the individual releases with no added special features other than the ones that are included with the individual release. Good for the price.",1357862400,129,2107,4.6

5714270,3,B00CC6Z0ZK,"The movies are not that good.  But this set is great.  All the discs come with ton of extra.

These are the scores from Rotten Tomato.  So, the movies are very rotten.
Resident Evil (2002) 34%
Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) 21%
Resident Evil: Exitinction (2007) 22%
Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) 23%
Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) 30%

For me,

the original RE is the worst because I have too much expectation to compare the movie to the game.  The movie has nothing close to the tone from the game.  If you want a good original RE movie, watch The Cube or The Thirteen Ghosts instead.

The second movie is a little better.  I like the second and the forth movie.  The second movie has a better story.

The third movie is as bad as the first one.  skip it or just trash the disc.

The forth movie is the best.  It has a great scifi element with a great story.  And the dogs are finally great again.  I will give the forth movie 5 stars.

The fifth movie has no story.  They think the more the better.  More guns, more characters, and more action.  No story.

They keep saying the movies are scary in the documentaries.  Nothing is scary when people with bad makeup are running around with rock music in the background.

There you have my opinion.  Oh, I bought this 2017, the single code for all 5 movies still work.",1506988800,,1323,4.390041493775934

Even though I already had most of these movies on DVD,
I bought this Blueray set on a price drop for $14.79,
and, as other reviewers have already said,
the digital copies all still worked even though they were listed as expired.

This package includes movies 1-5;

1 Resident Evil (2002)
2 Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004)
3 Resident Evil: Extinction (2007)
4 Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010)
5 Resident Evil: Retribution (2012)

I rewatched all these in anticipation of the latest movie,
my favorite, by far is the first one, the next three are about equally decent,
good action, interesting characters and plot twists
and sorry to say the 5th movie was my least favorite.

I loved that they gave a good summary of the first 4 in the begining of the 5th movie,
and incorporated characters from the first 4 in it as well,
I did not like the cheaper feel to the 5th movie itself,
parts felt like video game clips,
other parts felt like webisodes.

I don't know what the budgets were,
but I feel like they reeled the purse strings in for that one.

Great great set though,
the digital copies alone are worth what it lists for.

5714306,5,B00CC6Z0ZK,"Now that I've watched  Resident Evil: The Final Chapter I have to watch the whole series again. This all began as a first person shooter game for the original Sony PlayStation. This game was second only to the greatest of all first person shooter games HALF LIFE. The Resident Evil games are still going strong in Europe. That being said; This film series is based on a very popular game. Remember what I said before you give this series a bad review. If you've never played the game do not rag on the film series! Now, I highly recommend this series and the new film: The Final Chapter for your personal library. The Sony/Ultraviolet codes work and I have them in the cloud. I linked my Ultraviolet account to Flixter and VUDU. I got this series on AMAZON for about $4.00 a film. You won't find these films at that price anywhere. If your on the fence about buying this box set, trust me it's worth it. This would be great for a rainy weekend and binge watch all 5 films and than The Final Chapter.

5714324,4,B00CC6Z0ZK,"In the run-up to watching the final (or so they say) Resident Evil movie, it seemed like a good time to go back to the beginning. This Blu-Ray set contains the first five RE movies. Buyers should beware that the digital versions for which there are some codes included expired in 2014, and are therefore basically useless. As somebody who doesn't watch many digital versions on portable devices, I frankly couldn't care less, but some buyers may feel a little cheated. The quality of the Blu-Ray image is superb, and many of the scenes pop spectacularly on a 1080p TV. I was expecting the special features to be a little bare-boned, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that the discs come with audio commentaries, deleted/extended scenes, gag reels, and some fascinating behind the scenes featurettes. At the price (currently just under $15, which comes out at roughly $3 per movie) it's hard to beat the value this set offers. The movies themselves are a little on the cheesy side, but are packed full of action, gore, and some outstanding production design.

5714382,3,B00CC6Z0ZK,"This was a value at 14 bucks but this franchise gets worse and worse. In fact The Final Chapter negates several of these movies. Technically you only needed to see one, the end of two, the beginning and ending of three and four and the ending to five. All in all this franchise only needed to be two films maybe three, but that's pushing it.",1487203200,,341,4.2615384615384615

5714389,4,B00CC6Z0ZK,Love these movies but mine also came with a sticker saying that there was a code to unlock the digital copies of all 5 movies. But when I opened it I only was given one code for Retribution.  But no others.  Each disk was wrapped individually and one other movie had a sticker on the front and stated it had a code but there was no code in that one either.  I didn't think to take pictures before I opened them.  I did think it was nice that even though it states that the code is outdated it still worked so there is that. But it shouldn't have the sticker if the code isn't in the box.,1486944000,27,587,3.9914529914529915

Getting the box set and seeing that the movies did not in fact have a digital code included with any except one and that one had expired 3 years ago(but still worked because VUDU/UV can be cool like that) I was a bit disappointed.

I noticed that what this box set really is is just a repackaging of the movies that were on the shelf for years and didn't sell. Each was individually wrapped in addition to the overall boxes wrap and one of the movies actually had the security tape on it to prevent people from opening the case to take it out meaning that it was effectively triple wrapped.

3 dollars a movie isn't bad, but I'd wait until they release they full set once this latest film is out, maybe they'll finally include a copy on VUDU then.",1484611200,7,923,4.088397790055248

It comes in a nice chrome accented slip cover that holds the movies in separate cases....slightly thinner than normal blu ray cases. Each movie has only a single disc, but descent special features...each movie has good looking disc art, and the cases are clear, and when you open the case, I nice pic of a scene from each movie greets you on the left side, opposite the disc.

Downside there isn't a bundle code for digital copies. Retribution was the only one with a code though. Outside the disc on plastic wrapper it said the ultraviolet code would expire 12/31/16, but the paper inside the case with the code had an expiration date of 12/21/2014. Good news Vudu accepted the code and it gave me the HDX copy. The only real complaint is that the individual cases feels too flimsy. They are indeed the kind you have to open the clasp on the side. I haven't played any yet to see how they work so I'm hoping for a great HD experience.

5714515,5,B00CC6Z0ZK,"The five Resident Evil movies are excellent, entertaining, well cast and directed, and have deeply memorable object lessons about corrupt corporations exploiting biotechnology and chemical sciences for illicit gains in use as weapons.

I give the movies a solid five-star rating.

As for the Blu-ray discs, which is NOT the fault of those who created this cinematic masterpiece, they played flawlessly, that is, UNTIL I REACHED DISC 4 OF 5. The second to the last disc didn't play at all. The last disc had serious problems and crashed my CyberLink PowerDVD 15 software (which has a license to play Blu-ray discs on a computer Blu-ray player). Therefore, I cannot see disc 4 of 5, and I was stymied in watching disc 5 of 5 toward the end (during the end of the ""New York bio-hazard sequence"" in Umbrella's massive holographic simulator). I had to reload the crashed software, and then find an area ahead, which was the ""Moscow bio-hazard sequence."" I was disappointed, since this is toward the end of the last disc, and the spectacular conclusion, and I thought that I was home free. I stopped the Blu-ray disc, as I don't have the heart to get interrupted again. I may go back.

Therefore, I get three good Blu-ray discs, and two bad ones. I purchased this item on September 19, but didn't get to the last two discs until now. What a bummer.

Again, the movies themselves are a solid five-star! What inconsiderate person would give a one-star rating because of the discs? Why not give a five-star rating, then mention the problem instead?",1452211200,2,1539,4.774436090225564

Every one of us Resident Evil game fans know that these movies do a quite poor job of following the games in any way, shape, or form (who is Alice?? lol) I like the movies pretty good, but not as much as the games. As far as this collector's set in concerned, all it is is the 5 Blu-ray movies (just like if you bought them individually) inside a cardboard cover with the digital copy redemption slip. I don't mind buying this even though I know they will come out with more and have an updated set. I kind of agree with what another reviewer said though, they really should have called these movies Alice the Zombie Slayer!",1400976000,4,682,4.253846153846154

5714642,4,B00CC6Z0ZK,"If you are looking for a story with hidden meanings, romance, drama, or with some sort of redeeming value or moral, etc., this is not the series for you. I never watched this before until very recently and I liked it solely for entertainment. Just sit down with a favorite beverage, something to nibble on and watch the action. 'Brainless' you say!! When you need a movie you do not have to tax your brain on, or have it draw on your emotions because you do already at work or at home, plus you like science fiction to boot, try this. Nothing hard, nothing too complicated, good guys vs. bad guys with the undead thrown in the mix to make matters more complicated and the cute face of Milla to boot.  So for me - thumbs up - great deal on the whole series, excellent picture and sound. ENJOY!",1398988800,14,792,4.315436241610739

5714651,5,B00CC6Z0ZK,"5 films for the price of one 3D blu-ray film. It is a steal. I only paid $29.99 at the time and it was something I was not about to pass up considering I enjoyed the RE films. People who are not hardcore RE fans may not enjoy these films as much because knowing the games allows the viewer to pick out little nostalgic pieces they threw into the films that were shown in the video games. The quality of the blu-rays are outstanding though. If you enjoyed the films or are simply a die-hard RE fan, get this. At this price, no matter what, you won't be disappointed.

EDIT (3/6/2017) : ""By 5 films for the price of one 3D blu-ray film."", I meant that you can buy all these movies for what a single Resident Evil 3D Blu-Ray would go for, not that any 3D versions are included. My apologies for the confusion.",1386892800,32,806,4.2

5714656,4,B00CC6Z0ZK,"These are pretty fun sci-fi scary films that progress in production and special effects as the money involved making them get larger. There are several hints back at great suspense and horror films. Like The Birds from Hitchcock, All the Matrix films, Alien, and more. If you like those you will like these. Well done and a great package of films. With the package you can get Cloud storage of them too. It won't work with a pad to register though.

The Resident Evil movies are the best movies that anyone has ever created BASED ON A GAME, and  the movies still kept true to the in game characters we have all enjoyed on Playatation 1,2,3, Gamecube, Nintendo 64 Xbox, Xbox 360... I could go on... but the movies speak for themselves. Do yourself a favor have a guys night in and enjoy these movies with friends.

5714659,3,B00CC6Z0ZK,"Milla Jovovich deserves better treatment. The Resident Evil Collection includes 5 films on their own disc but a bonus disc would have been appreciated by fans. Afterlife is presented in Blu-ray 3D (but not Retribution 3D sold separately). You also get the 2D version of Afterlife for those who don't own 3D TVs. Overall, the picture quality is average but the audio is very good. The audio formats and subtitles vary by film. This set does have some extras but this is not a deluxe collection for RE fans. There is roughly 6 hours of bonus content for 5 films which is good but not great. If you already own the trilogy be aware that nothing new is added so you may consider buying Afterlife 3D and Retribution 3D in their stand-alone Blu-ray releases. Resident Evil: Damnation (2012) is not included. These are 4 star films in a 3 star package.",1380153600,23,845,4.602649006622516

You get action, stylized fighting, yummy Jovovich, nice surround sound effects with multi speaker setups. The zombies start moving faster with each movie, unfortunatley, the fifth movie Retribution is just a leftover hashed job from the fourth Afterlife.

After my initial dismay i went to a Best Buy and tried them in another player and they worked fine. Hmmmm what to do? So I went home and went through my PS3 setting and found out there was an update that had come out. After the update installed VOILA no more issues. Moral of the story - before you give bad reviews check your equipment and make sure you stuff isn't the problem. My experience cost me one BluRay disk since I left the test disk in the player at Best Buy.,1366502400,,574,4.0

Anderson or Capcom for selling out there beloved franchise to anderson. Every movie that has come is worse than the last, Paul Anderson took eveything that was good about Resident Evil and threw it in the trash, this movie might has well been called Alice the Zombie Slayer. Why bother having the Resident Evil liceanse if your not even going to use it, all of the movies are pretty much the same thing. Althogh characters from the game make appearances they're only there as side characters and lets face it Alice has no business being the hero of this franchise, and to make one thing clear the only Resident Evil heroines are either Jill Valentine, Rebecca Chambers or Clair Redfield.",1365552000,,839,4.526315789473684

Now to me this is a good set and the box sets did not come in cheap cases
if you think that all blue ray cases are good they are not because if you feel the cases of any blue ray case then you know it is a cheap case
Now you can get blue ray cases of another site.
Well just 5 stars and if one more movie comes out like then i will get that one too
Of course if you do not like scary movies then don't get this.
Also note that 3D versions are no good because 3d hurts your eyes",1364774400,,545,3.588235294117647

5714689,2,B00CC6Z0ZK,"The first movie is great and a sensible zombie/sci-fi movie.  With each new film they produce progressively is more ridiculous, has worse acting and plot.  The culmination of this is seen in the last movie in this series.  Other than the production quality the script and acting looks as if it is a sub par made-for-syfy movie.

The last two movies are basically two parts to an incredibly long and bad movie.

I gave it two stars because the first movie is great, the bluray discs work and the packaging doesn't fall apart.",1359936000,,524,4.591397849462366

The movies have played well, and I am really enjoying the ability to follow the plot all the way from the beginning.

I find zombies every bit as exciting as they themselves do, but at least they're good for getting me off red meat for awhile. The series stands out also as the only decent adaptation of a computer game ever. The Blu-Rays are spectacular, tons more extras than you'd ever need, and the commentaries are a crack-up.
