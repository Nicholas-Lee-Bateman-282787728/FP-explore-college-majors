2092350,5,B0002F6BTC,"Ahhh, I love this show, and i'm not even British.

The maddening Hyacinth Bucket, (pronounced Bouquet) is a somewhat high class house wife who lives with her impossibly pateint husband, RIchard Bucket, and constantly terrorizes her two neighbors, Emmet and Elizabeth with candlelight suppers and threats of joining one of Emmets stage plays, even though she has a most horrible voice. (though the actress got a Tony for her real voice, which is pretty good.)

KUA is a fantastic character study because one just has to wonder, how does Richard do it? Hyacinth is a great mental case. She never hears anything that she really doesn't want to hear, she ignores peoples feeling but expects to be treated like Queen Elizabeth herself. She has a royalty complex which causes her to bulldoze over everything just because she feels she can get her way. She constantly flaunts the tiniest of her social acheivements in peoples faces and tries to hide any smudges on her crystal clean social record, such as her step brother Onslow and sister Daisy.

The seasons are disappointingly short, I wish the seasons could have gone on longer, since the shows are only an hour and a half long. I found my self choking with laughter at many of thier jokes. The lovably lazy Onslow and sweet, horny wife Daisy, and slutty yet hilarious Rose (you'll note they're all named after flowers) are a great ensemble cast. (and predominantly aquarian.)

KUA is definatly a show to behold. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to have a good laugh.

Now, please remember to take your shoes off and don't rub against the walls as you adjourn to the lounge. Would you like some biscuts? And please watch the crumbs. I do hate it when crumbs get on the sofa. You'll notice my Keeping Up Apearances, the Full Bouquet Set, Volumes 1 through 8 purchasd through Amazon.com. And do watch the finger prints on the disc underside, will you dear?",1107129600,22,1907,4.7492447129909365
2092351,5,B0002F6BTC,"Fans of Keeping Up Appearances cannot be without The Full Bouquet; especially those who are ""socially less fortunate"" and need the lessons from England's  expert on social etiquette, Hyacinth Bucket...er, Bouquet.  Every episode is included in this set which is beautifully packaged in the most tasteful manner deserving of a glass of the ""Dowager Lady Ursula's homemade gooseberry wine."" It also offers holiday specials and lots of extras including Routledge's monologues as ""Kitty"" on Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV in the early 1980s (definitely a precursor to Hyacinth) which are waaaay too British for me to comprehend.  Brit Comedy fans also get a guest appearance by Are You Being Served? star Trevor Bannister (Mr. Lucas).  Here's what you get:

1. My Way or the Hyacinth Way with the following episodes: ""The Name is Bouquet: B-U-C-K-E-T,"" ""Welcoming the Dishy Vicar,"" ""Visiting the Acquaintance's Stately Home,"" ""A Fate Worse Than Serenity,"" ""Our Daisy and Her Boy Toy,"" ""How to Manage a Family Christening"" (my personal favorite where Hyacinth's niece Stephanie is having her baby christened but does not know which of her two hippy companions is the father).  Bonuses: Outtakes (bloopers), Cast bios.

2. Hints from Hyacinth with the following episodes: ""A Strange Man"" (Emmet's debut), ""Driving Mrs. Fortescue,"" ""Candlelight Supper,"" ""Golfing with the Major,"" ""The Googley-Eyed Register.  Bonuses: Outtakes (bloopers) and cast bios.

3.  Home is Where the Hyacinth Is: ""Cocktails with a Greek Shipping Millionaire,"" ""The Unfortunate Prospect of Early Retirement,"" ""Playthings for Daddy,"" ""Three Piece Suite,"" ""Picnic for Daddy.""  Bonuses: ""Funny Woman"" profile of Patricia Routledge, outtakes (bloopers), cast bios.

4.  Deck the Halls with Hyacinth: ""A Very Merry Hyacinth,"" ""Sea Fever""-an hour-long special featuring Hyacinth and Richard running all around the QE2, ""Angel Gabriel Blue-another hour-long special although not very Christmasy but it does feature a guest spot by Trevor Bannister known for his role as Mr. Lucas in Are You Being Served? as well as a bio of him in Hyacinth's guest book, ""Historical Pageant."" Bonuses: Kitty monologues which I'll warn you are very British, cast bios.

5. Everything's Coming Up Hyacinth: ""Half a Camel,"" ""How to Retire Early if You're Not Careful,"" ""A Portrait of an Artist as a Hen-pecked Man,"" ""The French Lieutenant's Daughters,"" ""How to Go on Holiday Without Really Trying,"" ""What to Wear When Yachting,"" ""Violet's Cottage."" Bonuses: outtakes, cast bios.

6. Some Like It Hyacinth: ""Hyacinth Tees Off!"" (another favorite of mine where Hyacinth tries to get Richard in the ""Frosticles"" firm, ""The Nautical speaker,"" ""Indoor/Ourtdoor Luxury Barbeque and Finger Buffet,"" ""Rural Retreat"" (starting the episodes where the Buckets have a ""cozy, charismatic country cottage""), ""Beacon for the Best in Hospitality,"" ""Please Mind Your Head"" (featuring Hyacinth on a horse), ""Let There Be Light.""  Bonuses include a UK commercial with Hyacinth and Elizabeth for Second Chance National Vocational Qualifications.

7.  Living the Hyacinth Life: ""Seaside Fun,"" ""The Fancy Dress Ball,"" ""Riparian Entertainments,"" ""Sister, Sister,"" ""Country Estate Sale."" Bonuses: Pebble Mill interview with Routledge and Clive Swift, outtakes, cast bios.

I thought I had seen every episode of Keeping Up Appearances on my local public broadcasting channel, but there are many here I have not seen before.  Buy this set now, or Elizabeth will drop a cup of hot tea in your lap!",1104364800,433,3691,5.495575221238938
2092352,5,B0002F6BTC,"I have always loved this show and was very happy to see it when it was originally released on DVD. It has truly paved the way to BBC Television for me, making me truly appeciate good British humour. However, the show was released in two box sets and I couldn't decide which to get: I had rented from my library all of the Hyacith in Full Bloom DVD's and a few of the Hyacith Springs Eternal. On the one hand, I had already watched the first one but on the other, I wanted to start at the beginning to get the entire series. Well, now I can just buy the full set! I can't wait to see all Eight DVDs lined up together: It should look rather impressive! Plus, the other sets were up to 79.99 a piece; that's 159.98 all together! So this box actually saves you nearly 50.00! I truly can't explain the happiness it brings to my heart to see the complete series in its great, snobbery glory. Enjoy and don't hesitate for even in a moment in your decison of purchase, Buy it-You won't be dissapointed!",1097452800,190,994,4.2368421052631575
2092353,5,B0002F6BTC,"Although this is a perfect collection  to have, somewhere on your page you should have warned that this is just a repeat of the previous two sets already on sale. MARY MILLAR who played ROSE was my wife and so I am always anxious to buy any of her works on sale. Were this to be  sold by any other company  it might  almost qualify as a rip off.

Anyone who's ever had to deal with the class division between ""contractor"" versus ""employee"" will immediately recognize this show's premise/setup, and will satisfy their Schadenfreude desires watching as the indominable Hyacinth gets her just desserts every time.

Class snobbery has never before been executed with such panache:  A ""bouquet"" for Ms. Routledge, who has no peer.  I loved it!",1093910400,,538,5.604938271604938

2092436,3,B0002F6BTC,"Three stars not for the show but the particular collection. Love the show but this disc set appears to be edited. Endings are completely missing. Having watched the show on PBS I suspect they removed content that may be deemed insensitive to a modern audience. I had read another review that said his discs ""skipped"" but thought it was bad luck. During the brief time the program was on Netflix I noticed parts were missing on the streamed episodes. When I this set arrived I realized the manufacturer must have edited it. The same segments are missing from my set that were missing from Netflix. So, buyer beware. I can only conclude that manufacturer edited out bits.",1490313600,3,669,4.726495726495727

That said its NOT the complete series as it states there's episodes missing holiday and skis. The crappy thing is as other reviews said there's places where the recording was compressed too much an you lose the ending of one episode and jumps to another.

2092501,1,B0002F6BTC,I bought this set several years ago but didn't get to watch all the disk right away. Just about every disk had several episodes that will not play. I can't believe I paid so much for the few episodes that do play. Like I said because I bought this several years ago I am unable to return it. So if you decide to go ahead and take your chances with this set my advice would be watch every episode right away to make sure that they all play. I am very unhappy about this purchase. I work very hard for the little bit of money I do make to buy defective merchandise. The company that made these disk certainly knows about this and should mail out everyone replacements.

Hyacinth Bucket (It's pronounced BOUQUET!) is a faux upper class social bully, who manipulates her husband Richard, the neighbors, family and everyone she meets, except her gay son, about whom she is in total denial. The program has the same cast throughout, except for Shirley Stelfox, one of Hyacinth's sisters, who sadly passed and was replaced my Mary Millar. A nice aspect is that the series is in chronological order, and at the end are a series of programs about the show and some of actress Patricia Routledge's ""Kitty Monologues"" as well as outtakes. 9 dvd's in an attractive set make this the ultimate gift for a ""Keeping Up Appearances"" fan.",1457827200,4,747,4.889763779527559

2092574,1,B0002F6BTC,"I bought this set many years ago.  Out of the box I had issues with playback.  All but two discs are damaged and will not play completely through.  I have used a half dozen methods of playback/capture/copy/rip/etc. in an effort to salvage my investment - all have failed.  i have tried to 'repair' the faulty discs with the Maxell PRO Disc Fixer, but even this has failed to recover the damaged portions of my investment.  The faulty discs will not play on any of three PC-based drives and also will not play on a 'normal' DVD player.  Visually, there are no defects on the discs.  The multiple methods I've used to try and read the damaged discs report multiple errors:  file encryption, 'broken' data blocks, unable to read file(s), etc.  The 'normal' DVD player simply hangs when I attempt to play back the damaged episode(s).

My advice to anyone who is considering spending their hard-earned cash on this DVD set is to record the episodes off the PBS channel in your local viewing area.  Yes, this would require an investment in technology - but this investment is miniscule compared to the resources I've wasted in trying to recover what I've paid good money, in good faith, to view.",1426118400,8,1189,4.668269230769231

2092587,3,B0002F6BTC,"Choosing a star rating for this DVD set was extremely difficult.  If I were rating the series itself it would most definitely get a full 5 stars because it is an amazing show.  I had to weigh the video quality and issues with these DVD's in with that and thus arrived at my 3-star rating.

""Keeping Up Appearances"" is one of my favorite British comedies.  I adore Patricia Routledge and Clive Swift dearly and they were perfectly cast in their roles.  I used to own the ""Full Bouquet"" 8-disc set released in 2004 but lost it in a house fire.  Replacing the set was a must-do because nothing is better in this life than a great laugh and this series most certainly delivers the laughs.  The comedy doesn't feel forced in the least and even someone who isn't a huge fan of British comedy can find something to like in this series.  Some episodes are epic in how great they are and every episode will make you laugh.

We all know a Hyacinth Bucket--""that's Boo-Kay!""--and are perhaps even related to one.  Relating to the various characters in this series is easy and you cannot help but like the entire cast.  Every character, even the minor ones, has something special about them that makes you like them.  You feel so sorry for poor Richard; no husband should have to suffer that much!  We've all been in Liz's shoes and felt uncomfortable around someone sometimes even to the point of being nervous and clumsy.  Onslow is amazingly comfortable with who and what he is and you have to respect him for that.  Our Rose is man-crazy and isn't really that picky (she's even got a crush on the dishy vicar!) while Our Daisy would just like her man to notice her beyond where his next beer or cuppa is coming from.  And then there is the star of our show:  Hyacinth.  What people think means more to her than anything else.  She's married to a civil servant but acts as if she's of the peerage.  She lives beyond their means, name drops, ridicules others for things she does herself, brags about what her sister Violet has and forces her opinions and wishes on everyone around her with not even a second thought as to what they want or how they feel.  In a way, Hyacinth is a very tragic character because she isn't liked very much by those around her.  Her family, friends and acquaintances would much rather avoid her than spend time with her, actually.  Even the postman doesn't want to deliver the mail and is willing to pay neighborhood children to do the job for him!  Her behavior is so much who she is that she doesn't understand, or even realize, how uncomfortable she makes everyone around her and how they truly feel about her.  They talk about her behind her back, run from her, hide from her and exchange looks behind her back.  She is oblivious to all of this and is convinced in her own mind that she is highly respected, that Liz's brother Emmet is attracted to her and that society absolutely could not function without her.

Now that I've talked about what I love about this series, I must talk about what I do not like about this DVD set and why I only gave it a 3-star rating.  While watching the first disc, two of the episodes skipped entire scenes to move to a place further along in the episode.  A few minutes later, the episodes stopped and the next episode began playing.  Discs 4 and 7 also gave me problems.  My plan is to find individual discs to replace the faulty ones in this set rather than try buying the full set again as others have experienced the same issues.

Another major problem I have with this particular DVD set is the video quality.  To my eyes, the video quality doesn't look as crisp and clean as it should on a DVD.  These discs almost look like VHS transfers as the video is fuzzy and sort of 'washed out' in places.  The quality of the video on the 2004 BBC Warner release was much better

The discs are in a kind of digi-pack which is something else I do not care for.  The case opens like a book but the 'pages' come apart incredibly easy and you're left with 9 loose DVD slips to deal with.  I liked the individual keep case format with the 2004 release as it protects the DVD's much better and makes getting them out much easier.  Sure I can store this set in less space than the 2004 individual keep case release and the digipack format is probably less expensive to produce.  Storage space doesn't matter as much to me as DVD protection and ease of removal.

I am thrilled to have all episodes of ""Keeping Up Appearances"" on DVD again without having to pay several hundred dollars for them.  However, I am disappointed with the video and packaging quality.  This series is a British treasure and I am sincerely hoping that the BBC will one day soon release a remastered edition (like they did with ""Blackadder"" in 2009), complete with all the extras and every episode in a crisp and clear video quality in collector-friendly packaging.  ""Keeping Up Appearances"" deserves a much better treatment than this release.",1424908800,12,4965,4.474972191323693

This is basically a ""irritating protagonist and the people around them"" type of sitcom, a la ""I Love Lucy"".  Except that Lucille Arnaz wasn't quite so irritating and her family and neighbors had quirks of their own.  Here, Hyacinth is just plain obnoxious, temperamental, and indifferent to other peoples' feelings, and all the other characters are defined by how they put up with her.

Despite some clever writing and good acting, the premise is just too much.  No surprise Loughridge was ready to call it quits even though the show was still successful at the time.",1407628800,,783,5.174603174603175

2092668,5,B0002F6BTC,"I've been watching ""Keeping Up Appearances"" since I was about 2... so forgive my presumption when I say I know just about every episode, every scene, and every bit of dialogue by heart!  Twenty-four years after it aired on BBC and about nineteen since it stopped production, this show never feels like it ages badly at all.
Roy Clarke (and producer/director Harold Snoad) have created a near perfect show revolving around this insufferable woman and her friends and family.  The plots can feel terribly similar if you think about it, but the cast and writer are clever and crafty enough to make each and every episode sparkle anew, no matter how many times we see Hyacinth try to better her life, no matter how often her nervous neighbor Elizabeth (the extremely sympathetic Josephine Tewson) spills coffee on the rug, no matter how many times Hyacinth's pretensions and schemes come crashing down because of her own hubris, the antics of her relatives, or a combination of the two, we always laugh because the situations walk a precarious line of believable absurdity.
At the heart of this show is the manically snobbish Hyacinth Bucket... forgive me!... Bouquet (watch the show to understand that little joke).  Patrica Routledge reportedly ended this show because she didn't want to finish her career as this character, though it is safe to say this will be her most memorable character ever!  Every action and reaction from the other characters of this show revolves around this force of energy in the floral dresses, fancy hats, and terrible singing voice!  This is probably the most successful show that sells on the sole idea of ""we all know someone like the people in this show"".  There's usually a Hyacinth in everyone's life: a woman of a certain age (i.e. old but not always) who we all dread seeing because she is either woefully full of herself while claiming to hate people who are like that (and boasts constantly about her perfect life and/or family) or shamelessly desperate to give the lie to the world that her life is better than it really is.
We have also met men (again usually old) like Hyacinth's long-suffering husband Richard (Clive Swift who is the epitome of the martyred husband): cowed by his wife, but sticking out his marriage because he knows she takes good care of him, despite her hair-brained attempts at bettering both their lives.
In America this has gone down as one of the most successful ""Britcoms"" alongside its 1990s contemporary ""As Time Goes By"" and 1970s classic ""Are You Being Served?"".  It is quite simply timeless, and although Hyacinth Bucket (dang it I mean Bouquet!) was never the high-class woman she wanted the world to believe she was, this show is of the highest class of sitcom television you can ever hope for!!",1404432000,,2769,4.841437632135307

One wants to feel sorry for Hyacinth, but her priorities are just so skewed that you find yourself relating to her ""victims"" more than anything. She tries so very hard to be someone she's not. That doesn't keep her from holding her candlelight suppers, however. Woe betide those who aren't invited, and worse for those who do attend.

PS...And one other I must credit for adding so much to this comedic experience, is the  Neighbor Elizabeth, who finds herself nervous and shaky around Hyacinth...and breaks and spills only when she's in Hyacinth's Home.",1398902400,,907,4.801282051282051
2092702,5,B0002F6BTC,"With over 360 reviews to its name (most of them positive, I might add!), I will try to summarize my remarks to a few brief observations here instead of making a ""critical"" review. For the record, this review is for the 8-disc ""Full Bouquet"" set (Amazon seems to condense reviews for similar products onto one page, which makes no end of confusion for the uninformed buyer).

I grew up with this show (it was one of the few reasons I was allowed to stay up late as a child). I didn't always understand the arguments or plots, but anyone can understand outrageously over-the-top behavior and that bellowing Pat Routledge voice. While this show will look a little dated by now, the underlying sense of humor and irony is undying. Despite the snobbery and obliviousness of Hyacinth Bucket, her problems are almost comforting by today's standards. This is one of those ""sweetie shows"" that anyone can enjoy and very few people will be offended by. It is tame but quirky, fantastical yet relatable. It's even bordering on wholesome despite Rose's man-hopping and some, er, *interesting* conversations involving Violet's eccentric husband.

It has often been asked why this show has appeal, particularly to American viewers (and some have even worried that this show made Americans think that most English people are like Hyacinth). The short answer is that I simply don't know. The long answer is much more complicated. I believe there is always some amusement to family situations and the embarrassment that subsequently arises from them. It would, of course, be palpably painful if you were socially conscious like Hyacinth and had an in-law like Onslow (or a sister like Daisy or Rose, for that matter) - but since a lot of us don't deal with that combination, it remains funny. Of course we know that the subset of Hyacinths in the world is small! Of course we know that there are far more people like Emmet and Liz (and even Daisy and Onslow, for that matter) on the planet! The delicious element is in seeing a supposedly grounded, cultured, and mentally secure woman get repeatedly knocked down a few pegs...and stand up again every single time. Equally delightful are the subtle digs that peaceable, long-suffering hubby Richard manages to utter now and then (watch out for these because they're ALL worth it!).

As a closing thought just for fun, I offer my favorite 10 episodes (places to start for the daunted newcomers who just got this set but haven't seen this show before):

It arrived with 2 of the DVDs loose because the little thingies that hold the DVD (i.e., that you ""snap"" the hole in the DVD into to ""lock"" it in place) were broken.  I carefully checked and played them without problems but, idiot that I am, was so busy viewing KUA I didn't move them all to separate DVD cases.  Within a few months one of the DVDs was scratched in the binder/case and it won't play.  I learned my lesson and tossed the case but still haven't replaced that DVD.

2092881,4,B0002F6BTC,"Just as Marvin the Paranoid Android is funniest to those close to depression, Hyacinth Bucket is screamingly funny to anyone who deals with truly difficult people.

The way her nearest and (possibly) dearest cling to their passive pleasantness is the perfect foil to Hyacinth's outrageous acting-out. Her astounding brusqueness would be nothing without the exquisitely gentle Elizabeth to occasionally draw a quivering hint from. One's pity for Richard is halted in its tracks by the realization that he chose this, and chooses to go back every day; it must do SOMETHING for him -- and in moments like that, we look at ourselves with more clarity, and a bit more compassion, than usual.

Most of us have to put up with a bit of insanely bad behavior now and then, whether from neighbors, partners, family members, or bank managers. Or even the milkman. Hyacinth, and the people who respond to her, draw the barbs and make it funny for the rest of us, out here in the real world. The gentle but persistent resistance that emerges over the series gives us hope that maybe one day even the bully will change her ways.

Production quality is good, costumes and hair are perfect reflections of personality, and the scripts are extremely well-written. Intelligent but silly fun, especially when you're feeling a bit under siege from bullies, Powers that Be, and other acts of God :)",1369612800,,1376,4.871794871794871

2092982,5,B0002F6BTC,"KEEPING UP APPEARANCES was one of the BBC's most successful series of the 1990s.  The adventures of the incorrigible social climber Hyacinth Bucket (sorry, Bouquet) delighted audiences worldwide.  In truth, the scripts by Roy Clarke were not much to speak of, full of comic class stereotypes traceable back to the Ealing comedies of the 1940s and 1950s, but the series really depended on Patricia Routledge's towering central performance.  Originally from Liverpool, it was hard to believe that the actress herself was nothing like the character she portrayed: Routledge was just a natural comedienne, with superb gifts of comic timing, both verbal and nonverbal.  To watch her doing comic double-takes whenever something went wrong was a joy in itself.  The supporting cast was equally superb, ranging from Clive Swift's henpecked husband Richard, to the late Geoffrey Hughes and Judy Cornwell as Hyacinth's lackadaisical brother-in-law and sister, and Josephine Tewson's hapless next-door neighbor Elizabeth.  KEEPING UP APPEARANCES is timeless in its humor; it still regularly turns up on the BBC's global entertainment channel BBC Entertainment.  Enjoy it again and again.",1364947200,,1176,5.573033707865169

Quickly becoming my #2 favorite television show of all time (after only ""I Love Lucy""), ""Keeping Up Appearances"" never fails to bring a smile to my face and laugh out loud no matter how many times I've watched the episodes.  Patricia Routledge is the British Lucille Ball, with her unparalleled talent for excellent comedic timing and hilarious physical comedy.

With my local PBS station having stopped airing the show regularly, this excellent DVD set is exactly what I need.  All the episodes with great bonus features, it is a must have for any fan of great television, great talent and timeless comedy.",1356825600,,707,4.915966386554622

2093067,5,B0002F6BTC,"There is so much of Hyacinth's perception in today's world.  Have a look at what we have witnessed with the recent Presidential campaigns.  Hyacinth represents what is true in all of us, and that's what makes this so special.  Sure, some of it is matter of fact, and its mostly amusing rather than funny.  The episodes seem to get funnier toward the end of the series.  But if one is expecting knee slapping comedy, look elsewhere.  This is more of a satirical comment on a way of living, and could be geared to the older crowd, with exceptions.

The DVD transfer is as good as can be expected, and the sound is okay, but nothing spectacular. The extras are nice, and I love the specials, especially the one filmed on fabulous QE2.

This set is a must for any self proclaimed anglophile.",1356480000,,787,4.492957746478873

2093092,5,B0002F6BTC,"Although it seems too ridiculous to work so hard at `keeping up' appearances, I can understand how difficult it must be sometimes to distance yourself from things or people that seem to pull you down.

Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet)  is constantly looking over her shoulder and seeing her poverty-stricken relatives, who are grasping at her when `Daddy' does something unsavory, usually running after reluctant ladies, with or without his clothes on. Her struggle gets funnier when people, ignorant at her efforts and pretense to blue blood provenance, pronounce her name Bucket, which is unfortunately her married name.

Always a step ahead in her social climbing, always ready with a believable and most respectable explanation even when her relatives show up on her doorstep uninvited, Hyacinth never tires.
She is every neighbor's nightmare especially when they are summoned to one of her candlelight suppers and they just can't say `no'. She is also trying desperately to break into show business by attacking her musician neighbor, Emmet, with tone-deaf shrills every time she runs into him, by chance or by design.

Her husband Richard, is a humble government servant. She is his commander and nemesis. Her son Sheridan is away at the University, most likely to be rid of `mommy'. He lives with Tarquin and he is majoring in tapestry and needlepoint...Only calling home when running out of money, he is still mommy's pride. She never questions his choice of studies and she is very happy that he `doesn't run after girls'.

Hyacinth sees herself equal to her only wealthy relative, her sister Violet who is unhappily married to a turf accountant. He likes to wear his wife's dresses (and looks better in them), a fact that has to be discreetly swept under the social rug.

She lectures every unlucky poor salesman who has to come to her door and demands removal of shoes, including the mailman, the postman, the meter reading man, the local Vicar and the Jehovah witness who wears red socks with large polka dots.

She is also `an aristocrat' and compares and emulates herself to the Queen. She suffers from an incurable case of 'delusions of grandeur'.

This huge effort to hide her humble origins, her incredible reasoning and absolute confidence in her impeccable manners and taste, create the most absurd and funny situations. She is a snob and she is not hiding it, she is proud of it. She goes to ANY length to appear sophisticated, educated and high class.

She uses her husband in particular, her neighbors and her family in the most convenient ways just to advance herself socially while she is completely oblivious to the fact that no one can stand her. She is a happy snob, she goes about life in her obtrusive but, mind you, elegant way and she NEVER gives up. She is a tireless pain and no one dares to let her know about it.

The cast is excellent, the writing and acting are wonderful and the show is a pleasure to watch. I love it and I can watch it over and over.",1352246400,2,2993,4.80544747081712
2093093,5,B0002F6BTC,"Witty, clean humor; a nice satire on social climbers.

I don't know why I enjoy watching this show, maybe because the entertainment world seems to be obsessed with crime shows, violence, and generally negative aspects of humanity.  This show is an escape from that, with the most traumatic thing being the breaking of some fine china.

Netflix took it off of instant streaming (boooo hiss Netflix!)so I was happy to find this complete series.  I am annoyed by the BBC ad/promos embedded in it, but at least they are not advertising products. The packaging is acceptable, but it isn't anything that would impress Hyacinth!

The included bonus features were nice to see, interesting to see the difference between the actress Patricia Rutledge and the character Hyacinth Bucket.

Watching eccentric snooty Hyacinth trying to deal with her equally eccentric sisters is always good for a loud laugh.  I know a few people just like her!  Unfortunately, we lost actor Geoffrey Hughes who plays Onslow, last July 27th 2012 to cancer.

2093098,5,B0002F6BTC,"I love the packaging - no slipping, scratched DVDs within broken or easily breakable casings; each DVD held fast on a substantial, easy-to-manipulate, hard clear plastic which flips to the next... like an 8 (or 9) page book. Pretty attractive too.

I'm not a huge fan of a lot of British comedy, but I ordered ""The Full Bouquet"" remembering I loved this series years ago; hoping I'd still find it entertaining; and most of all, I hoped my Mom who has suffered a ""small"" stroke would still enjoy it as extended dialog and complexities within a joke or a plot-line are now difficult for her to follow. My hopes are fulfilled.

Mom and I watch and enjoy this together which is the loveliest thing of all... and which might say something very positive about the wide spectrum audience this show can appeal to. The humor includes a hint of social commentary wrapped neatly within farce, wit, running gags, a delightful ensemble cast, etc.

Patricia Routledge is acclaimed by people far more knowledgeable than I, but I'll chime in anyway. I find her delightfully hilarious in this series. Playing central character, Hyacinth Bucket (""that's BOUQUET!"") she can be appreciated as down right amazing even by folks of theatrical laity like me. She's obviously a master at making people laugh - from subtle facial nuance to overt physical comedy... and can anybody deliver a line - or a word - more masterfully than that gal?

Isn't Clive Swift kind of a marvel? playing Richard Bucket as neither shriveling wimp nor Ricky-Ricardo-style antagonist, Clive Swift somehow makes it believable that Richard stays with this wife of his as she trudges him tirelessly through endless adventures and attempts at keeping up appearances - something he seems to care nothing about.

I'm happy I purchased this and would recommend it to anyone who'd like to skip the mean spirited humor; skip the crude and the lewd, and just sit back in some pleasant evenings of smiling, chuckling and laughing.",1345939200,2,1973,4.895209580838324

2093116,5,B0002F6BTC,"I had first seen this program on my local PBS station every weekend years ago back in the 90s and possibly early 2000s. I took an instant liking to it. This was one of the BBC's greatest comedy shows ever produced. Running for only five seasons (1990-95), it had a funny group of characters (most of the female characters were named after flowers). Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced ""bouquet"", as she strictly insisted to other people who mispronounced it, Clive Swift as her husband, Richard, Josephine Tewson as Elizabeth, Hyacinth and Richard's next door neighbor, the nervous lady who was always shaky with Hyacinth's coffee and chinaware, Geoffrey Hughes as Onslow, etc. The list goes on and on. This collection is indeed called ""The Full Bouquet"", because you get every episode unedited; nothing left out. The DVDs are well organized in their own hard plastic holders, and are not difficult to remove. The inside of the binder has the list of episodes that each DVD has. You can also jump to scenes of episodes. The theme music for this show is very beautiful, with a warm, cordial classical feel to it. If this show was American and if all the actors were American, I'm certain it and the actors would have won Emmys for their roles on the show. This program is a must have for anyone's DVD library. If you love British comedy, be sure to also get: Absolutely Fabulous: Absolutely Everything and The Vicar of Dibley: The Immaculate Collection.

For years, I've been like most people watching the local PBS channel and seeing the shows in random order.  It was great putting in disc 1 and watching from the beginning.  What I like most is that the picture is much better than my PBS channel even in high def and the dialogue is more easily understood.  This was the third set I received and I have to give ""cuddos"" to AMAZON before going further.  On set one, I opened it up and noticed what was either a production error or blob of adhesive in each disc.  They sent me set two.  Same thing.  Each time all I had to do was fill out the return tab and send it back.  They even picked up the return postage.  With this set, I took the time to lift out each disc once I saw it had the same thing.  It wasn't a problem with each disc, it was the clear plastic that houses each disc!  Did I ever feel less than intelligent.  Now if this isn't great customer service, I don't know what is.  Back to the star of the show...no matter how many times you see these shows they are still funny and you pick up things missed at previous viewings.  I've seen many British comedies over the years and my two favorite are (1) Keeping Up Appearances and (2) Absolutely Fabulous.  Not only do the actors in each series shine in their characters, they really show some top-notch comedic writing.  If you have seen these shows on t.v. and wonder if the cost of this set justifies ordering it, it's a no-brainer, get it.  There's nothing like having Keeping Up Appearances at hand should your cable go out...or your local PBS show stop airing it.  A fantastic buy!",1333411200,2,1678,4.26984126984127

I was introduced to this series through my local PBS station.  All I can say is thank God for public TV or I never would have known about this gem!  The characters are absolutely hilarious.  As the other reviewers have said, this show is wonderful.

Keeping Up Appearances truly crosses across the generations.  Gathered around the TV set was an 88 year old, two 53 year olds and a 20 year old with all four of us laughing our tails off at the antics of Hyacinth and her family and friends.  It became our family favorite.  Mom, who was getting on a bit and couldn't remember the shows name, always asked me to ""put on the funny lady"" for her.

We have had six years of entertainment from these disks and they have held up tremendously well.  For all the use they have had I'm surprised they still play as if they were brand new.  I love the show and quote Keeping Up Appearances constantly.  It is truly my favorite television show of all time.

Please, do yourself and your family a huge favor & purchase this set.  You will never be sorry and you will have years of laugh inducing entertainment at your fingertips.  Everyone should have a ""funny lady"" at their fingertips.",1330128000,3,1372,5.089686098654709

2093165,5,B0002F6BTC,"I love Keeping Up Appearances.  I have watched it over and over since PBS stations first started showing it here in the U.S.  So I gave it 5 Stars, but since others already did a great job reviewing the entire series, I decided to focus on one DVD in the set...

DECK THE HALLS WITH HYACINTH is one of the most confusing DVDs I have ever encountered, therefore I have decided to generate a detailed analysis and share the results, with you...

1.  A VERY MERRY HYACINTH (29:16) (AKA: THE FATHER CHRISTMAS SUIT)
Original Airdate: December 25, 1991
Richard is supposed to dress as Father Christmas to distribute gifts to ""the old folks"" at the church, but after Emmet gets him drunk, things go totally askew.

2.  SEA FEVER (58:05)
Original Airdate: December 26, 1993
Although this is one of the best episodes of Keeping Up Appearances ever, definitely in the top 5, the original airdate is the only thing that indicates that it ever had anything to do with Christmas. It had to have been filmed months before Christmas time as there isn't one decoration up anywhere on the QE2. But that's completely OK as there is an extensive (although hurried) tour of this beautiful cruise ship, making it a fascinating, wonderful, and hilarious episode.

3.  ANGEL GABRIEL BLUE (48:20)
Original Airdate: December 25, 1994
Daisy's red and green hair ribbons, and a little Santa in Onslo and Daisy's living room, have more to do with Christmas than anything else in this episode.  Even the title has nothing to do with Christmas.  That's OK, because it includes one of the all time best Coffee with Hyacinth scenes ever.  And, yes, Trevor Bannister (Mr. Lucas from ""Are You Being Served"") does a great job as the salesman.

4.  THE PAGEANT (29:10)
Original Airdate: December 25, 1995
This one is all to do about Hyacinth wanting desperately to put on a Historic Pageant about a local civil war in the 1600s with Hyacinth playing the Queen, of course.  When none of the volunteers show up, she recruits her entire family, including constantly arguing Violet and Bruce, Rose in a cat fight with one of her boyfriend's wives, Daddy and his new friend, and of course, Elizabeth and Emmet.  Again, nothing really to do with Christmas... Not complaining, just trying to clear up the particulars on this DVD.

It is Extremely Interesting to note that Season 4 actually ended with ""Sea Fever"" (Dec 26, 1993), and then AN ENTIRE YEAR LATER ""Angel Gabriel Blue"" (Dec 25, 1994) was the ONLY EPISODE FILMED IN 1994!!  Season 5 began on Sept 3, 1995!!!

""The Pageant"" however, ended Season 5 normally, and was sadly the very last episode of Keeping Up Appearances.

As the producer of Keeping Up Appearances stated in the PBS Documentary ""Behind The Britcoms"" it is truly sad when a show ends with no closure.  For many of the Britcoms the writers are given the opportunity to create a wonderful ending, which is a tribute to the cast, and a satisfaction for the audience.  But although they had more ideas and things they wanted to do with Hyacinth and family, Patricia Rutledge just suddenly decided she didn't want to do it any more, and there you are.  It's finished.

2093166,5,B0002F6BTC,"This British series takes place in the mid to later 1990's in a small middle class British town.  It's main character Hiacinth Bucket (pronounced by her ""Bouquet"") is married to Richard, (who is very much hen pecked by her), a son Sheridan (who is off screen, in college, gay, of course Hiacinth does't know it & he is the apple of her eye), they have a deep Psychic connection.  She also has three sisters Violet, married to the big turf accountant who has bought Violet a sauna, swimming pool & house with room enough for a pony, oh I must mention a Mercedes as well, however, he is also a cross dresser.  Her sister Daisy, who is married to Onslow who is bone idol, work shy & out of condition, but Daisy is head over hills in love with him, even after 20 years of mairrage.  Rose, well Rose loves the gents & Rose lacks no shame in her game, much to the shergrin of Hiacinth.  There is Daddy who loves the ladies & well dances to the beat of a different drum. Although her family well does not live up to the standards of Hiacinth, she still loves them very much.  Elizebeth lives next door & is forced to have coffee with Hiacinth daily.  She dreads this so much she usually spills the coffee.  Emmett Elizebeth's brother moved in with her after his divorce.  He is a trained pianist.  Hiacinth wants to be an opera singer.  Emmett insults her as much as he can but usually finds himself hiding from her rather than having to deal with her singing to him.  All these characters with Hiacinth, is a series all about her trying to give the impression that she is in a much higher class than she really is.  Her antics don't work & usually leave her looking worse.

2093188,5,B0002F6BTC,"There are many of us who have had no particular interest in British television, partly out of being programmed to watch typical American TV, or maybe out of snobbery.....hmmm. To be truthful, there are some where the plots and even the dialogue is simply too difficult for Yanks to understand---I'd seen ads for Absolutely Fabulous, and thought it looked hysterical...and was really disappointed because by the time you figure out what they're saying, you've missed the joke. If you have to pick just one Britcom to sample, let it be this one.  I'm so glad I listened to a family member and gave Hyacinth and Co. a try. ""How funny can an overbearing, social-climbing, overdressed steamroller be"" sez I to myself. I know a couple of them personally, and they're NOT amusing. This series, however, is.  The humor is universal, the dialogue clear and sparkling, and it's played to perfection by a really talented cast. Patricia Routledge is one of the truly great comediennes of all time. True comedy performers are not afraid to occasionally look ridiculous, less than their 'prettiest' or even get a faceful of mud once in a while. Hyacinth does all that and more. What's really interesting about the character is that it could easily have been played one-dimensionally, leaving absolutely no sympathy for her. Routledge takes her up some notches, making Hyacinth basically a caring person but one who loses her sense of balance---really easily and really comically. The rest of the actors are just as on cue, with flawless timing. Timing is everything, after all, and these people know how to make the script work,no matter how outlandish the plot. Miss Routledge carries the bulk of the performing duties, but everyone----her harried Richard, her florally-monikered sisters, the philosophical and bone-idle Onslow, the dishy vicar---yes, even the paranoid postman---is always believable and very, very funny. The writers and creators of this program deserve a wealth of praise. You'll be glad you accepted an invitation to The Residence on Blossom Avenue.",1310601600,,2056,5.134328358208955

No, it's pronounced ""bouquet!"").

Join the superior Hyancinth as she plans her spectacular candlelight suppers, nautical buffets and riparian repasts with nerve-wracked, coffee-spilling neighbor Elizabeth (""You'll have a beaker, Liz? I think that's wise.""); volunteers at the ladies altar guild church bazaar (""Last year, my white elephants cornered the market!""); shops for a ""modest"" country home (""I shall enjoy entertaining here.""); plays keeping up with the Barker-Finches (""He was a Barker, she was a Finch, now they're hyphenated!""); shops for holiday brochures; chases after her doddering and senile old father after he escapes his room at sister Daisy's again (""I'd have him at our house only he drools.""). Laugh out loud as Hyacinth attempts to escape the romantic overtures of the very married Major (""Ahh! The Bucket filly!"") or disguise the fact that her sister Daisy and husband Onslow (""They are my family and I love them dearly, especially at this time of year, when it gets dark early."") are dead common and live in blissful squalor; and seems clueless at the implications of the fact that son Sheridan (away at university), doesn't have a girlfriend and wants 70 for a pair of silk pajamas like his roommate Tarquin has (""Now surely you can't begrudge the boy a pair of pajamas!""). Join hen-pecked but lovable husband Richard (""A power in local authority circles"") as he contemplates spending his early retirement with Hyacinth (""Ye gods, early retirement!"") visiting the remains of Iron Age fortifications; and watch as love-crazed sister Rose (""I've come to help out with church cleaning for that dishy vicar!"") dates a Mr. Marinopoulos, a Greek undertaker whom Hyacinth mistakenly assumes is a wealthy oil tycoon (""He's Greek, they buy tankers and things.""); howl with hilarity as Hyancinth has to referee sister Violet's (""She married the turf accountant, you know, the one with a Merecedes, swimming pool, and room for a pony."") fights with loopy husband Bruce (""Bruce's gone off again!"") who occasionally likes to dress up as Maid Marion.

2093218,5,B0002F6BTC,"KEEPING UP APPEARANCES, THE FULL BOUQUET, is a total delight!  Funny and full of human foiables, it shows to what lengths a lower-middleclass Englishwoman will go to, to ""keep up apperances"".  The advertisement on American P.B.S. stations included the memorable scene of our heroine(?) Hyacinth Bucket, saying: ""I use First-Class stamps!""  Hyacinth pronounces her last name, (Bucket), as ""Bouquet"" -- and, despite her many, (many!) other pretentions on the show, one really can't blame her for this.  (But maybe she could have prevailed upon her husband for both of them to legally change their last name?) Yet why ""Hyacinth"" did not add an extra ""e"" to the end of her name, making it into the more distinctive, ""Hyachinthe"", I'll never know.......

Hyacinth's hijinks often reminded me of 1950s TV -- the plots started simply, then got more and more complicated, (and sometimes, downright bizarre) -- but always completely logically so.  Like a morning rush-hour bus that starts out empty, then winds up with people sitting in all seats, standing in all aisles, and having scarcely an ounce of air left for anyone to breathe, the plots of ""Keeping Up Appearances"", zig, zag, go upwards, downwards, sideways, backwards, forwards, then backward again, then go to the right, left, down the mountain, up the mountain -- and threaten to sometimes be launced into the tele-literary equivalent of outer space!  But they are all followable -- for people on both sides of the Atlantic.  This is one series that Americans, Canadians, and other people in North, South, and Central America, can follow as well as Europeans.  Every society has it's snobs, after all.  And with Hyacinth Bucket, the hilarioous side of snobbery is out in the open, for all to see.

Hyacenth has a husband, Richard.  The poor guy is put opon so often!  Whilst, (""Whilst?"" yep, there's a bit of a snob in me too, I fear!), watching this show, I often thought that perhaps he should have divorced Hyacinth, and married, instead, the put-upon ""Alice Kramden"", from the 'Honeymooners'.  (Wonder what a couple Hyacinth and Ralph would have made? : )

Hyacinth's pretentions, (and probably, I must herein admit, my own, even though at presently these pretentions show up only verbally, in my writings -- and embarrasing no-one -- or so I do very fervently hope!), stem from the fact that WE think we are as good, (or maybe even a wee bit better?) than most people....and haven't had any REAL opportunities to prove this.  Many, (or dare I say, most?), people harbour a ""secret snob"" within them, and I wonder if I am being less -- or more? -- of a snob as I admit this failing in myself.  Seriously, I do believe that, had Hyacinth, (or I), access to a driver's licence and a completed college educaion, things may have been different.  The difference betixt the fictional Hyacinth and I, I believe, is that I REALIZE when I am being even the slightest bit snobbish, and try to tone it down, or at least find a better venue for it, (I am trying to find a way to join MENSA at the moment....hoping I will not find TOO many snobs there, should I succeed.)  I also look for REASONS for any snobbery I may have -- which Hyacinth, of course, does not.  Blissfully unaware of how her pretentions are EFFECTING others, she AFFECTS a pseudo-gentility that has nothing whatsoever in common with real gentility.  Hilarity results from what happens, (or rolls out!), following Hyacinth's actions --- and her being totally and completely unknowing of the strangeness her actions, or their strained and straightened consequences, makes us laugh all the more.

Queen Elizabeth II, who has the opportunity to be one of the world's greatest snobs -- but instead, is one of the world's most level-headed people, (if you don't believe me, read up on her....and watch the revealing documentary, ELIZABETH R.) -- once said, of a new member of the Royal Family, ""Oh, she's much more royal than the rest of us!""  No -- this was NOT Kate Middleton, for it was said years and years ago -- and it would not be politic to reveal who this Royal Family member is.  Probably, by this time, I suspect even THIS royal family member has come more down to Earth.  Not so the endearing, but also frustrating, and delightfully comedic, fictional Hyacinth Bouquet -- er, Bucket.  Hyachinth is, in many ways, the exact opposite of the delightfully normal, real-life Duchess of Cambridge, (Kate Middleton.)  In real life, snobbery is never a way to get ahead.  In fact, the very WORD 'snob' comes from 'sine nobility' -- or, (ta-da!) translation from the Latin: -- NO nobility!

So, laugh along with Hyacinth and her husband, (well, maybe he's not laughing too much-- but you will), her neighbours, friends and family.  And if you happen to know any real-life snobs, give them a gift of this complete set....at the right moment, of course.  Complete snobs may have no manners whatsoever -- but you do, of course, don't you?",1306281600,2,4947,4.818934911242604

Patricia Routledge does a tremendous job playing Hyacinth Bucket (Bouquet). Her efforts to create a perfect lifestyle are always being thwarted by her family, the rest of the shows talented cast.

One thing I find interesting is as the show progressed over the years, how the actors seemed to truly become the people in their rolls. I can't imagine any of these actors as anyone other than their character. I still envision Onslow and Daisy sitting in front of an old TV somewhere, eating crisps while Rose paces back and forth in the background waiting for the phone to ring.

I think what makes this show so appealing is how most everyone can relate to her issues with her family. A single sister jumping from guy to guy, eccentric relatives, crazy parents, snobby people down the street and an effort to juggle them all. Every episode offers something new and funny to watch, and once you start with the series, you will want to see every episode.

A must have set for your BBC DVD collection!",1304380800,,1215,4.509090909090909
2093232,5,B0002F6BTC,"A really funny show with brilliant acting.  Patricia Routledge manages to portray her horribly abrasive and obnoxious character as a completely self-unaware sweet and caring lady.  Clive Swift manages to portray her hen-pecked husband not as weak and wimpy, but as stoic and somewhat noble.  Josephine Tewson is also excellent as the sympathetic neighbor caught in the nerve-shattering web of ""the Bucket woman"".  The rest of the cast is also wonderful and the writing is clever.  Watching Hyacinth micro-manage her poor husband's driving is reason enough to love this series.

This DVD set is great.  The series is currently available for streaming on Netflix, but who knows for how long?  There are also numerous extras on the disks not available for streaming.  This truly is a set of disks that you will want to watch repeatedly from time to time.

My only complaint about this series is the laugh track.  It is horribly intrusive, and the series would be much funnier if it were not present.  I just tune it out.  I wanted to dock this review a star for it, but I just cannot.  Ignore the laugh track and enjoy a talented cast for what they are, brilliant.

2093240,5,B0002F6BTC,"Everybody loved Lucy in the 1950s. There can be no denying that Lucille Ball was a master at her craft  and the preeminent physical comedienne of her day.  I was quite certain that we would never see the likes of her again. That was until I was introduced to the work of Patricia Routledge in the hilarious 1990's British sitcom ""Keeping Up Appearances"" which debuted on many PBS stations around America in the latter part of that decade.  I quickly concluded that Lucy Ricardo had met her match.  What I found to be even more remarkable was that Patricia Routledge was in her early 60's when she portrayed the insufferably snobbish Hyacinth Bucket (she insists it is pronounced ""Bouquet"") on this show.  And being that she was a rather large woman to boot made the incredible physical prowess she displayed on this series all the more remarkable.  Given the grueling demands of her role it is no wonder that only about 8 episodes per season were shot during its five year run and that Patricia Routledge decided to call it quits after the 1995 season.  Only 40 regular episodes and 4 additional specials were made.  ""Keeping Up Appearances:  The Full Bouquet/Special Edition"" offers up every single one of these memorable episodes along with a boatload of extra features.  Longtime fans of the show are certainly going to want to get their hands on this incredible collection while it is still available.  To me it was worth every penny!

While Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth was without a doubt the star of the show ""Keeping Up Appearances"" also featured an incredibly talented supporting ensemble.  Clive Swift was just perfect as Hyacinth's henpecked husband Richard.  Richard was a rather unassuming guy who just happened to to married to a woman positively obsessed with social status.  Just about everything Richard does is wrong in Hyacinth's eyes. Your heart would go out to him in each and every episode.  Ditto for the Bucket's next door neighbors Elizabeth (Josephine Tewson) and her recently divorced brother Emmet (David Griffin).  Hyacinth had an uncanny ability to make these two otherwise normal human beings quake in their boots at the mere sight of her.  Although the scene was repeated with a number of slight variations time and again during the course of the series Hyacinth's seemingly innocous invitation to Elizabeth to join her for a cup of coffee and biscuits would invariably end in disaster for her well meaning neighbor.  Each encounter would prove to be nerve-wracking for Elizabeth and always ended with some kind of calamity.  And it was always funny....very funny!  And then there is Hyacinth's family,  You would be hard pressed to find a more disheveled group of individuals anywhere.  Most prominent among this group is her sister Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and her chronically unemployed husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes) who is if nothing else the consummate slob.  Seems like every time Hyacinth is trying to impress someone these two show up unexpectedly to throw a monkey wrench into her plans.  Poor Hyacinth!  She tries so hard!

As I indicated earlier ""Keeping Up Appearances:  The Full Bouquet/Special Edition"" is a 9 DVD set that features all 40 regular season episodes along with three Christmas specials.  As an added treat there is a newly produced feature entitled ""Life's Lessons From Onslow"".  You will also find some very funny outtakes and interviews with cast members Patricia Routledge, Clive Swift and Judy Cornwell.  At the end of the day I would have to rank ""Keeping Up Appearances"" at or near the top of my list of all-time favorite sitcoms.  I simply never get tired of watching these shows.

2093264,5,B0002F6BTC,"This is the series that started my love and appreciation of British comedy. Plus, I think I have a soft spot for Hyacinth ""Bouquet"" because I sometimes see myself in her.

In true British fashion, this show is pretty over-the-top and exaggerated. The main character, Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced, according to Hyacinth, ""Bouquet"") is nearly unlikable in her overbearing tendencies as she tries to ""keep up appearances"" with those around her. Essentially, she tries to shield the vicar, next door neighbors, and other important people from her more down-to-Earth and less affluent sisters and brother-in-law. She never sees the irony in that, while trying to keep the true nature of her family a secret, she 1) usually makes most situations worse, drawing more attention to what she's trying to conceal and 2) misses that people actually like her easy-going family better than they like her. Just when you really start to dislike Hyacinth, she shows another side of herself--a surprisingly sensitive, caring person who, under the pretenses, really loves her family.

While I like all the actors in the show, Patricia Routledge is particularly outstanding--an amazing and accomplished actress. She takes the character to great places in a way that I couldn't imagine anyone else doing. This series and the extras included (like The Kitty Monologues) inspired me to go and look at more of her work.",1295308800,,1394,5.163716814159292
2093265,5,B0002F6BTC,"Ms. Bucket - Bouquet is easily the funniest physical comedian in English film. I am always amazed that one so generously proportioned can handle the acrobatics with the grace she does. The ability of the oh so proper English to laugh at themselves makes every installment of this series a pure delight. While a surface evaluation might make one believe that it is the snobbish Ms. B who is the being held up to laughter and ridicule, a closer look shows the wonderful humor in exposing the average English as too polite to object to anything for fear of hurting someone's feelings, a diffidence which Ms. Bucket is all too ready to exploit.",1294704000,,640,4.672566371681416

2093268,5,B0002F6BTC,I purchased this as a birthday present for my mother. She absolutely loves Keeping Up Appearances. She is only able to see episodes when they air on our local PBS station on weekends and then only one episode is shown. Now she can watch every single episode whenever she likes.

This was the first time I had ever used Amazon.com but I will be a returning customer. Price, quailty and service were all better than expected.

2093270,5,B0002F6BTC,"I must admit, I met Hyacinth late in life. I believe it was around 2000 when I first wandered into this fussy lady's house, told to remove my shoes, and then hastily escorted into the kitchen where I was not given a Royal Doulton cup with the hand painted periwinkles, but a simple beaker (I'm prone to dropping things). The visit was hasty, but quite funny and enjoyable. Despite her resolute fussiness, I stayed. Possibly because I enjoyed her antics (could you breathe during the episode with the small attic second house in the country?), her suffering husband, her encroached neighbors, and her sisters and brother-in-law who wears a sweater (occasionally) that I doubt has ever been washed.

This set is marvelous. Other reviewers painstakingly laid out the episodes that are include. I shant. For those of you who are fans of Britcoms (and for those of you who are new to them and are wondering if this set is worth your time and money), I have to give a hearty thumbs up. This is rich British humor, resting on the shoulders of Patricia Routledge, a comedienne of such fine talents. She is a treasure. She never plays Hyacinth for the ultimate snobby fool that she is, but can pull out the slapstick humor quite well when Hyacinth out ""Hyacinths"" herself.

I highly recommend this set. It gets played in our house quite often. Sometimes on a lazy Saturday afternoon, all it takes is one word ""Hyacinth"", and we are returning to her life and hilarious antics.",1293840000,6,1466,4.700389105058366

2093287,5,B0002F6BTC,"If you are a fan of British comedy you are certain to recognize the name Hyacinth Bucket.  This show premiered in 1990 and the original VHS tapes were very expensive and difficult to come by, thereby keeping it out of reach of the average customer.  This set, which for me was a surprise gift ordered from Amazon, is a marvelous value.  Purchasing individual seasons can be costly, especially when you add in the postage.  The color in this series is excellent, the sound clear, and the packaging makes it easy to store.  Each DVD is in its individual, hard plastic casing.  The entire set is set up so you can turn these cases like a book easily finding your episodes.

There is no booklet with this set, but the cast of characters and the history of the series is readily found on the Internet.  The only ""major"" change to the cast was that of Rose.  Shirley Stelfox played her on season one and the subsequent four seasons were played by Mary Millar.  If you want British comedy at its best, you'll be looking at this affordable set.  Whether you favorite character is Hyacinth, Richard, Daisy, Onslow, Rose, or even Bruce you'll have hours of fun with this series. Which is your favorite episode?

2093313,5,B0002F6BTC,"Keeping Up Appearances has to be one of the funniest TV series ever produced anywhere.  The Full Bouquet is a great deal for 8 discs of the show itself. The ninth discs is of a PBS special which has Onslo making observation about human behavior using clips from the show to illustrate his points.
The ninth disc would be funnier if one does not view it right after watching the entire series. And watch the entire series at one time, as much as possible, I have done many times.
As for as who could ask for more, I do.  I want more episodes, lots more.  What a hysterically funny show. If you have never seen Keeping Up Appearances, just go ahead and order The Full Bouquet unless you can buy all of the individual discs because you surely do not want to miss a single minute of this wonderful series.",1270684800,10,801,4.326666666666667

2093317,5,B0002F6BTC,"The character of Hyacinth burst into my home in the 1990's and was an instant winner. We were laughing out loud at her ridiculous escapades and shenanigans. And ""Keeping Up Appearances"" quickly won a special place in our hearts; the series spanned 44 episodes and became a popular import from across the pond. The focal point of the comedy here is that this woman will stop at nothing to seem classy and refined, even if it means hiding her frumpy family members from neighbors and friends, or going to extremes to look important. And it always backfires on the poor woman.

The entire cast is wonderful but Patricia Routledge steals the show as the harried hostess Hyacinth Bucket (""it's pronounced Bouquet""). Routledge is a master of incredible facial expressions, amazing physical comedy, astounding verbal acrobatics, and timing. You can tell she will do just about anything for a laugh here; whether it's getting completely drenched in a rowboat or having a mammoth dog drag her rapidly down a lane (in heels, no less).

Another special element in this program is the recurring gags and characters and situations that we come to expect from most episodes. It's very rewarding as you view the series to see your favorite 'bits' appear time and again . . . whether it's a phone call from  Sheridan asking for money, or Elizabeth spilling the coffee, or Onslow's dog frightening Hyacinth . . . and so on, and so on.

I've recommended this show many times to friends and acquaintances. This is top notch comedy, and deserves attention just as much as ""Fawlty Towers"" and the rest of the greatest Britcoms. And even though there were only 44 episodes aired (we're usually used to at least a hundred episodes here in America with our TV series), on DVD they are very rewatchable and retain their hilarity. Something truly funny remains so always, I believe.",1266105600,3,1856,4.827044025157233

To say the episodes were hilarious is an understatement.

After a few episodes you get to know the different characters and understand where they are coming from.  I was able to pin members in my own family to parts played in this series.  Even those in this country can relate to this family one way or the other, this stuff takes place everywhere! Situations shown transcend geographic boundaries.

2093363,5,B0002F6BTC,"My younger son introduced me to Hyacinth a couple of years ago and I've been a staunch fan ever since. This series is terrific and it never misses a beat.

I grew up the UK in the 1950's then left for the States at the age of 19 as a GI bride and, for me, this is pure nostalgia.

Like The Jerry Seinfeld Show, the individual episodes are about absolutely nothing and the storylines depend entirely on the characters' interactions with one another.

Whoever put these stories together has a truly wicked eye. I swear, at one time or another, they must have encountered my late father and stepmother because they've reproduced them perfectly. Appearance, relationship, everything.

Richard is the spitting image of my father and my stepmother was so like Hyacinth, it's almost spooky. Daddy used to refer to himself as 'one of the last remnants of a seedy aristocracy' and he once told me that my stepmother's main problem was that she was ""not quite out of the top drawer"". (Even her own daughter used to hide from her, and as for the neighbors....)

There was a family picnic on the Thames when I was about twelve which could have inspired one of the series' funniest episodes. It had the same comedic ingredients, including my stepmother's dunking in the river as she was mincing her way onto the dock from our rented punt. She had on a snazzy blue and white linen nautical outfit, including a hat, which was, of course, ruined. As she was being hauled ashore by my father and stepbrothers, I made the fatal mistake of giggling and I don't think she or her sons ever forgave me. (I'll admit that I was supposed to be hanging on to the mooring rope at the time and let it go slack at the worst possible moment; but I didn't do it on purpose, honest.)

My husband, who grew up in rural Iowa and has never been out of the US, enjoys Keeping Up Appearances even more than I do.

In closing, the series is a genuine treasure and well worth every penny of the price I paid. The production quality is excellent, the packaging is the nicest I've ever seen and I'm only sorry I can't give it more than a 5.",1253491200,5,2099,4.422279792746114

BUT everyone else can see through her facade. Her husband is so whipped, that I thought he was her butler the first few episodes. I love how she answers her home phone like its a business.

Her only friend Liz & her brother Emmet,love watching her make a fool of herself.
Her family who she is ashamed of, reminds me of the characters on Roseanne only more loveable. Her two sisters, her brother in law and her senile father all live in a crappy house. The front lawn looks like a junk yard and even has a dog living in one of the mashed up cars on their front lawn. They have a car that backfires and her aging sexbomb sister ,Rose  looks like tammy faye baaker in Lingerie. Some of the humor is strictly british and just plain weird But if you like the office, you will like this.
I always wondered what happened to the characters after the series  was canceled. I hope Richard left Hyacinth and dated someone like Liz,but I know he never will.",1249171200,,1205,4.226086956521739
2093369,5,B0002F6BTC,"Patricia Routledge triumphed in her role as Hyacinth Bucket pronounced Bouquet instead of Bucket. Well, she is the oldest of four sisters in this sterling comedy that has made me laugh for almost 20 years. I have seen ever episode probably a hundred times each but I wasn't counting. In fact, Patricia Routledge could have played the late Julia Child just as well as Meryl Streep. In fact, Patricia Routledge is brilliant in this role as the woman that people loved to hate. She is married to Richard played by Clive Swift who does the brilliant, under-rated job of being the long-suffering husband. Her neighbor and best friend, Elizabeth Warden, is played by Josephine Tewson who doesn't spill a drop and her brother and divorcee, Emmett Hawksworth, played by David Griffin. You can't imagine the look on Hyacinth's face when she finds out that Emmett is in charge of the local operatic society. Whenever she sees him, she's singing away much to his discontent. Emmett thinks she's mad but she thinks that he has a crush on her.

Oh Hyacinth has a family of interesting characters like her slob of a brother-in-law Onslow played by the gifted Geoffrey Hughes and his loving wife Daisy who wants a little more affection from her husband. Then there is her younger sister, Rose, played first by Shirley Stelfox and later by Mary Millar. Unlike American comedies, sometimes sitcom actors aren't available so they replace them. Shirley did an adequate job in the role of the slutty sister. Mary Millar made her little more vulnerable and entertaining. Still, they were well-trained to make the role of Rose, their own. Hyacinth hears from her other sister, Violet, who is married to Bruce, the accountant with a swimming pool, sauna and room for a pony at their home and her own Merchedes-Benz. We don't meet Violet and Bruce until the end of the series but we hear enough about them. Then there is Daddy who is elderly but still wants to get married and if off and running away on his own capers like a child.

Hyacinth has hands full with her family and neighbors. Then there is the new vicar and his wife who join the series and Mrs. Councillor Nugent played by the late and wonderful Charmian May. I don't know why Patricia Routledge didn't get Damehood but she is not far from it but I doubt that she will.

2093432,5,B0002F6BTC,"Keeping Up Appearances isn't merely one of the all-time great British television comedies, but the dowager lady Hyacinth Bucket, as played by the peerless Patricia Routledge, is undoubtedly also one of the greatest comic figures in British history, a new breed of distaff Falstaff for our current gilded age.

When I watch Ms. Routledge do her formidable stuff here -- she knows she is playing one of the most indelible characters ever, and boy, does she go to town with it! -- I think of someone like W.C. Fields, another comic genius who had it all -- the timing, the physical comedy, the appearance, the voice, the vocabulary.

The rest of the cast is right there with her, but I must give special mention to Josephine Tewson as Hyacinth's nervous and long-suffering neighbor Elizabeth.  Part of the wonder of this show is the way it exploits the power of repetition in comedy, and Tewson somehow manages to spill her coffee in a new and hilarious fashion every time Hyacinth invites her over.

From the way Hyacinth answers the phone to the dog that surprises her every time she visits her poor relations to the way she unfailingly describes her sister who married well -- somehow it all gets funnier through repetition in the course of this beautifully written series.

We all know a Hyacinth Bucket, and the first time you hear Hyacinth insist with a tone of gentle condescension that it's pronounced ""Bouquet,"" you know that this show has captured the ferocious middle-class snob for all posterity, and with great hilarity.

This is a wonderful series from the BBC about everyone's favorite social climber, Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced ""bouquet"").  Her house is spick-and-span. Richard, her long-suffering and hen-pecked husband, keeps the car in immaculate condition (under Hyacinth's every-watchful eye). The empty milk bottles sparkle on the doorstep after their obligatory rinse in the dishwasher. To Hyacinth's horror and shame, most of her family is dead common, living together in a rundown house that looks like a junkyard. Sister Daisy and her husband, Onslow, are out-and-out slobs while another other sister, Rose, is an aging tart, and Daddy is not quite ""all there"". At least she is proud of her 3rd sister, Violet, the one ""with the Mercedes, a sauna, and room for a pony"" although Violet's husband is a cross-dresser and somewhat of an embarrassment to Hyacinth.  However, she loves them all, and never fails to rush to their assistance when they need her help. Often it is Daddy that has got into an embarrassing situation which Hyacinth (or Richard) has to always solve.

2093438,4,B0002F6BTC,"Why is it that the best British sitcoms have incredibly annoying lead characters?

First there was John Cleese as a mad hotelier, and Rowan Atkinson as the entire offensively sarcastic Blackadder dynasty. Now, there is Patricia Routledge as a social-climber with affected manners and a piercing voice. And with the aid of talented supporting actors and some gloriously madcap scripts, this sitcom becomes almost pure comic bliss.

Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced ""Bouquet,"" ss) is the local social climber, and a terror to all who know her -- she views herself as the doyenne of good taste, artistry, morals, decorum, and class, and her perpetually-in-debt son Sheridan as being the next Einstein.

She kisses up to the wealthy and aristocratic, and anyone who is closely associated with them, unaware of how much her self-promotion scares them and occasionally offends. Her weary husband Richard (Clive Swift) and nervy neighbor Elizabeth (Josephine Tewson) dread whatever she has next, especially when Elizabeth's sharp-tongued brother Emmett moves in.

She adores her sister Violet, who married a wealthy, unfaithful transvestite and has ""a swimming pool, Mercedes, and room for a pony."" But she'll do anything to hide her impoverished family members: her wacked-out father, sloppy romantic Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and skanky Rose (Mary Millar), who has a new boyfriend for every episode. Not to mention Daisy's couch potato hubby Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes).

The series opens with Hyacinth trying to hide the fact that ""dear Daddy"" was hurt while bicycling naked after the milk lady. And when she makes an effort to befriend the handsome new vicar (the ""dishy vicar"" as Rose calls him), her family shows up in full crazy mode, announcing that dear Daddy has been kidnapped by a gypsy.

From there on, she must tackle dozens of other problems: athlete's foot, mad cruises on the QE2 (with Onslow and Daisy), inadvertent theft of a Rolls Royce, riverside picnics gone awry, suicide attempts, estate sales, country retreats, anniversaries, nautical disasters, musicals, barbecues, raunchy Majors, Richard's ill-fated stint as a filmmaker, Christmas kisses, and Rose's decision to become a nun in a miniskirt. ""It's all right,"" she announces as she drunkenly smooches the vicar. ""I'm going to be a nun!""

This one also includes the later-produced ""Life Lessons From Onslow,"" a funny little clip show in which Onslow finds himself teaching a university course, illustrated by various clips from the series. God help those students.

""Keeping Up Appearances"" is in the grand tradition of really embarrassing British sitcoms, usually with at least one person who makes everyone else insane. And there's no excessive need to get Hyacinth out of her various dilemmas -- the writers just crank up the humiliation and craziness, and let it climax as the show finally ends.

Sure, there are some dud episodes -- the amusement park one with all the old people is full of one-note jokes. Sorry, but old ladies throwing up is not funny more than once. Most of the time, however, the writing is spot-on, from Rose's affairs with married men (""You swore you'd be faithful... and then... I catch you sneaking back to your wife!"") to Hyacinth's efforts to hide her family (singing so people won't hear Violet's brawl with her husband).

Routledge is the star of this series, no doubt about it -- she makes Hyacinth a magnificently awful character. She is frighteningly annoying, but she's also completely oblivious. Not only is she unaware that other people see her as an upholstered harpy, but she's unaware that her son is gay, her hubby is the walking dead, and that when people hide from her it's not a cute little joke.

Swift is a great counterpoint, as the weary husband who has stopping trying to fight Hyacinth, and only hopes that he can find a few reprieves at work. Tewson and the perpetually grimacing David Griffin are excellent as her neighbors, and Judy Cornwell and Geoffrey Hughes as Hyacinth's distinctly unaristocratic sister and brother-in-law.

Social appearances, family and madcap misunderstandings are the heart of ""Keeping Up Appearances."" Snobbery has never been so funny.",1212278400,69,4176,5.17037037037037

Hyacinth tells her mostly good-humoured husband, Richard, that she will not have him walking around with a fungus on his fooot, and that he does NOT have Athlete's Foot, but Gout, the plague of the aristocracy.

Hyacinth's warm-hearted, yet slovenly sister Daisy, married to bone-idle intellectual Onslo who has nightmares about black holes, and answers his statement to the effect of I had a bad night with, ""I know, I was there,"" just wants a little romance.

Hyacinth will not have her sister Violet divorcing her husband Bruce unless the money for their large house with an important postal code, her Mercedes and room for a pony drys up, even though Bruce loves to play Robin Hood and Maid Marion and Violet is not the one wearing the dress.

Youngest sister Rose is a Rose is a, well let's just say Rose likes short skirts and the gentlemen.  Crushed into a car on the lap of Emmett, the dishy divorced neighbor of Hyacinth, showcases Rose's 'hormone problem.'  Emmett's sister Elizabeth has developed an alarmly twitchy arm whenever handed a cup of coffee at Hyacinth's.

When Hyacinth visits 'Daddy' in the hospital she's informed by the doctor that his 'injury' was sustained while he chased the milk delivery woman across the park on a bicycle and fell into the creek nude and drunk, she quickly determines the real story.  Daddy was merely trying to order an extra cream - you know how Daddy loves his dairy - and asks the doctor to show her the injury he sustained after such a plucky act.

Hyacinth's worst nightmare is being seen with her family in broad daylight!

I recommend buying the entire set of DVDs - I've bought every episode I could get my hands on - because you will grow to love Hyacinth's family as your own, hoot out loud, and find the episodes get funnier the more you watch them.  And be sure to sit back and enjoy a gloose of the Dawager Lidy's Geeseberry Wine when you watch them.",1200096000,,2463,4.794326241134752
2093495,5,B0002F6BTC,"Folks, I have to highly suggest this comedic series. It is absolutely fantastic. The humor is so easy to get involved in and infected by. Don't debate or wonder, this is the set to purchase for those who love laughing!",1199923200,,218,4.475
2093496,5,B0002F6BTC,Keeping Up Appearances is so much fun.  We watched all the DVDa--and were saddened when they ended.  Although I would not want to be a member of Hyacinth's family--I didn't want to see the stories end.  It was really like giving up a twisted part of one's family.  The acting is super. Patricia Routledge makes me want to go out and buy a set of Royal Doulton china.  Seinfeld surely must have taken pointers from these classic sitcoms. They are a blast from the past yet haven't lost their sense of current day humor.,1199750400,,518,4.468085106382978
2093497,5,B0002F6BTC,"We also love Daisy, Onslow, Rose and even Father. We love them all. Their family antics keep you laughing as Hyacinth tries to maintain her status in society. She is amazing as she controls the family activities. And the faces she makes are priceless. Daisy and family are just as hilarious as they struggle along in their little house with Rose and Father. They have a dog who lives in an old car by the front door (that is when Father's girlfriend isn't in the car!!) and the dog never fails to bark at Hyacinth and she falls into the bushes. Just a lot of fun and laughter as we watch the families live their lives....we love it!!!",1199145600,,634,4.38135593220339
2093498,5,B0002F6BTC,"This is a full on candlelight dinner. If you loved the series, get these DVDs. The extras are a tad thin, but still worth it in the end.",1198454400,,136,3.892857142857143
2093499,5,B0002F6BTC,"Script writer Roy Clarke uses a very productive formula for this hilarious BBC situation comedy.  In opposition to a middle-class housewife obsessed with maintaining what she deems to be the highest levels of good taste and genteel behaviour are her relatives: scruffy, deviant, senile, unambitious, bone lazy, and flirtatious.  Of course, she cannot prevail against such heavy odds, but she is never deterred from keeping up appearances.  Never, for example, will she admit that her surname, Bucket, should not be pronounced ""Bouquet"".  Thus there is not only enormous comic potential in the individual characters exemplifying this formula, there is also the fun of seeing Hyacinth Bucket's efforts bringing her to one disaster after another.
 Patricia Routledge, already in her early 60s, plays the zealous Hyacinth Bucket with enormous energy.  Although Hyacinth is a monster and although her relatives are walking inadequacies, they all endear themselves to the viewers.  Most episodes are closely packed with entertaining material.  My favourite is one from the third series, by which time other script writers had taken over from Roy Clarke.  In it, almost all the characters relocate to the country cottage of Hyacinth's sister Violet, and join at the end in a hilarious Indian file dance around the garden.",1197244800,9,1314,5.3707317073170735
2093500,5,B0002F6BTC,"This is a great set!  I have always loved Hyacinth (that's Bouquet, B-U-C-K-E-T!) and her wacky, social-climbing misadventures.  This is the entire series, with some hilarious outtakes and actor bios included in special features.  Hours of fun will be had by all watching this wonderful series.  I recommend this for anyone interested in British humour.  Pour yourself a glass of the Dowager Lady Ursula's homemade Gooseberry Wine, kick back, and enjoy!!

You will be glad you stepped into the world of BUCKET!",1190764800,,396,4.438356164383562
2093519,5,B0002F6BTC,"There's little I can add to the other reviews of this exceptional series, but will make a few comments. This is not a one-person show- the 'secondary' characters hold their own just fine- and often steal it. Also, they change little over the course of the series. In some instances, this might lead to tired jokes, but with Keeping Up Appearances, it doesn't. I laugh aloud every time I watch it. My 80-plus year old mother in law had to watch it twice through before she returned it to me. (Now I know what to get her for Christmas!)

The picture and sound are clear, and nice extras are included. The outtakes are hilarious. Being not from England, I sometimes find accents hard to understand, however that's not a problem with this.

I always appreciate reviews that give a heads up about suitability for families. Keeping Up Appearances is not for children. It features ""M'sistah Rose"" hobbling about in stiletto heels and mini-skirts while engaged in the single-minded pursuit of anything in pants...including the poor vicar. Also, there's the occasional 'b' word. Later in the series, Daisy is preoccupied with getting her beer-swilling husband Onslow interested in sex. Don't get me wrong- there's nothing crude about the show, despite this. It's just that the content is sometimes, but not always, a bit naughty and it's not for the kids. My teenage sons get a kick out of Hyacinth's ways (...and take great delight in pointing out how much I'm like her in the car!)

This ranks right up there with Are You Being Served? and The Irish R.M. I highly recommend Keeping Up Appearances- you won't be disappointed.",1190678400,,1617,4.809352517985611
2093520,5,B0002F6BTC,I loved the show to beginj with and having the WHOLE series just made it even better. Totally worth the cost in laughs alone!,1190592000,,125,4.25

You'll never go a day without some laughter from the 40+ episodes of Hyacinth, Richard, Elizabeth, Emmet, Daisy and Onslo, Rose, the Vicar, and the Vicar's wife.

The Christmas specials are on a separate disk and not in chronological order which may bother some purists. Every disk also includes out-takes plus usually an interview or some other special video to add to the enjoyment.

The disk quality was excellent, however several of the shows on the 8th disk seemed of a slightly lesser quality then the rest of the set. Sound and video overall excellent on all of the other shows.

We just finished watching them through and are ready to start over. I envision many years of enjoyment with this set - you won't go wrong by purchasing this set of videos.

2093639,4,B0002F6BTC,"Fans of British sitcoms, such as Faulty Towers, Are You Being Served and Men Behaving Badly will indeed love this show. Having developed a cult following in the early nineties, I discovered the show by accident late one night on cable. After only seeing a handful of episodes and being thoroughly entertained, I immediately bought the complete series. And at such a low price it was definitely great value for money, with every episode included on the 8 disc set as well as plenty of extra features.

For those unfamiliar with the show, the plot revolves around Hyacinth Bucket, who likes to pronounce her name ""bouquet"", although it is indeed Bucket. Hyacinth spends her time climbing the social ladder and pretending to be of a more sophisticated aristocratic class. Always out to impress whether it be by socialising with those in a higher class of hers, or by doing community services around the neighbourhood or simply by trying to impress the neighbours with her 'candlelight suppers'. Hyacinths poor suffering husband Richard, patiently endures his wifes snobbery and social scheming, and this is where the real humour lies.

Patricia Routledge and Clive Swift are absolutely hillarious as Mr. and Mrs. Bucket, with a solid supporting cast including Geoffrey Hughes, who has been on British television for years. With the exception of Hughes, all the cast are mainly theatre actors with limited experience in front of the camera, but that is irrelevant as they all do such a wonderful job.

2093701,5,B0002F6BTC,"Why is it that the best British sitcoms have incredibly annoying lead characters?

First, there was John Cleese as a mad hotelier. Now, there is Patricia Routledge, as a social-climber with affected manners and a piercing voice. And with the aid of talented supporting actors and some gloriously madcap scripts, this sitcom becomes almost pure comic bliss.

Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced ""Bouquet"") is the local social climber, and a terror to all who know her -- she views herself as the doyenne of good taste, artistry, morals, decorum, and class, and her perpetually in-debt son Sheridan as being the next Einstein.

She kisses up to the wealthy and aristocratic, and anyone who is closely associated with them, unaware of how much her self-promotion scares them. Her weary husband Richard (Clive Swift) and nervy neighbor Elizabeth (Josephine Tewson) dread whatever she has next.

She adores her sister Violet, who married a wealthy transvestite and has ""a swimming pool, Mercedes, and room for a pony."" But she'll do anything to hide her impoverished family members: her wacked-out father, sloppy romantic Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and skanky Rose (Mary Millar), who has a new boyfriend for every episode. Not to mention Daisy's couch potato hubby Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes).

The series opens with Hyacinth trying to hide the fact that ""dear Daddy"" was hurt while bicycling naked after the milk lady. From there on, she must tackle dozens of other problems: athlete's foot, mad cruises on the QE2 (with Onslow and Daisy), inadvertant theft of a Rolls Royce, riverside picnics gone awry, suicide attempts, Richard's ill-fated stint as a filmmaker, Christmas kisses, and Rose's decision to become a nun in a miniskirt. ""It's all right,"" she announces as she drunkenly smooches the vicar. ""I'm going to be a nun!""

Sure, there are some dud episodes -- the amusement park one with all the old people is full of one-note jokes. Sorry, but old ladies throwing up is not funny more than once. Most of the time, however, the writing is spot-on, from Rose's affairs with married men (""You swore you'd be faithful... and then... I catch you sneaking back to your wife!"") to Hyacinth's efforts to hide her family.

Routledge is the star of this series, no doubt about it -- she makes Hyacinth a magnificently awful character. Not only is she frighteningly annoying, but she's also unaware of how other people see her. Swift is a great counterpoint, as the weary husband who has stopping trying to fight Hyacinth's social climbing.

Social appearances, family and madcap misunderstandings are the heart of ""Keeping Up Appearances."" Snobbery has never been so funny.",1129852800,33,2651,5.07816091954023
2093702,5,B0002F6BTC,"It is imperative that if one wants a genuine British comedy classic, one has to own Keeping Up Appearances. And if one has to own this series, one has to purchase the Region 1 complete boxed set. Believe me, it is worth it.

I first heard (I didn't watch it the first time but heard it whilst I was in bed one lazy Sunday afternoon) this a few years ago, I wasn't exactly watching, I was just listening to it. Just out of nowhere, my laughter was loudly heard (loud enough to be heard across the North Sea) in my house. From then on, i became a huge fan of this series. Keeping Up Appearances was made under a constellation of lucky stars, but the brightest star of them all is Patricia Routledge. She is a brilliant actress, a superb technician, a comedienne with a sing-song sweet soprano voice and perfect timing. Like musicians, it's either you have it or don't. Patricia Routledge shames and eclipses all other comedians. She's simply perfect, now created a Dame by her Majesty, she has all the reasons to invite everyone for her candle light suppers!!!

Like many other British comedies KUP does not have any antagonists, ironically, it is Hyancinth Bucket (pronounced ""Bouquet!"") who drives everyone insane with her non-stop polishing,articulating and organising social functions which would elevate her to the upper class hierarchy with unsuccessful and extremely funny results. Oddly, just when she is starting to triumph, somehow, her family shows up who are her anti-thesis. Council-estate tenants, jobless, scruffy and downright unclassy, they exist to ruin her momentum and embarass her to her guests either to her notorious candle light suppers or her tea and light refreshments. Enter Daisy, her love-lorn sister who is married to brutish Onslow who has tattoos all over his big arms and never wears a shirt or a tie (come to think of it, i don't think this man has a shirt or tie!), her other sister Rose who is emotionally unstable who's always involved with married men (she's so funny always frequently entering their bedroom without knocking with a barrage of littany of moans and heartaches). Plus there's her rarely seen wealthier sister Violet who's  got a big house with a swimming pool, sauna and room for a pony. She's married to strange Bruce who loves to wean women's clothing and drive both sisters insane. Plus there's ""Daddy"" who's attracted to unattractive ""unsuitable"" women.

Other characters involved are her neighbours, all thumbs Elizabeth who frequently spills coffee all over the place, has broken many of her  Royal Doulton fine bone China  with hand-painted periwinkles!, her divorced brother Emmet who she sings to  her all the time, giving him broad hints to include her in his amateur operatic society, there's the vicar (very handsome Jeremy Gittins) and his Scottish wife (to put it politely doesn't burden the other cast with her acting skills which actually works because it adds humour to an already insane cast with insane situations), there's Sheridan (never seen just on the phone all the time asking for money. He's presumably gay, who's got an intimate friend called Tarquin whom he goes to Iceland with, good with needles and hand embroideries. Plenty of double entendres referring to Sheridan's sexual orientation ""Richard, don't you think Sheridan's voice is changing?"", ""I'm sure Sheridan likes faerie cakes!""), there's also Major, the postman, the milkman, Mrs Barker-Finch at number 23, the list goes on!

This kind of British humour has stood the test of time. Unlike many comedies (American  sitcoms for example), they rely on situations and contrive it to make funny, uses toilet humour or rated r dialogueor simply just tries too hard. KUP and other British comedies have an edge, they are intelligent but not too intellectual, subtle, and the characters are well-defined. It doesn't also rely on a big budget or big named stars. It is subtle with a talented cast. Everyone has a catch-phrase that they repeatedly utter every episode. Hyacinth: ""The ""Bouquet"" residence the lady of the house

speaking!"", ""Sheridaaan"", ""Richard I will not have you..., Emmet : ""She'll sing at me.., Vicar: ""It's the Bucket woman.., Onslow ""Oh nice.."", etc, etc. BUT it works. Because it is performed by an array of well trained theatre trained actors, not straining too hard to make a point, extremely adept to infusing fire to their characters. American sitcoms try too hard, are hardly intelligent and are over acted and annoying. Subtle is a word that these sitcoms don't have.

It extremely annoys me some reviewers complain about the repetetive nature of the dialogues. They simply don't get that the humour relies healvily on these repetetive catch phrases uttered in different circumstances. It works, it never did in other shows and I believe it never would in other  programs. Try for example Will & Grace, yes it's funny but doesn't warrant repeteive viewing. A lot of American sitcoms just try too hard (typical), if they just base the humour on characters and situantios, they can probably end up with a classic such as KUP.

This complete boxed set is worth every penny. Every episode is a joy to watch, characters are so charming and likable. British comedy rules!",1129334400,16,5225,4.971363115693013

2093706,4,B0002F6BTC,"I discovered this show during my college years, as we only had 5 channels on the network stations that barely came in through the ancient electrical systems and PBS was one of 2 that came in clearly enough to see.  So I became aquainted with a lot of British comedies (other than Monty Python) through this circumstance.

This show appealed to me because the heroine is more like the villan.  Hyacinth Bucket (or ""Bouquet"" as she prefers to be called) is a social climber looking for power and prestige.  She is lovable enough to be amusing and likable to the audience, but her friends and neighbors run in other directions when they see her coming.  She's embarassed by her middle class roots and her family (I love her bother-in-law who sits in front of the telly all day with his undershirt just barely covering his huge belly) and wants to escape them, but try as she might she can't get away.  And her wonderful husband Richard, who has the patience of a saint and the highest tolerance for pain I've ever seen who grits his teeth and bares the whole thing is just a scream.  One after another of her plots and plans fail to bring about the aclaim she needs.

Perhaps because they are English or because they are fictional characters are they more subtle with their humor and Hyacinth's antics.  She does not dress or act nouveau riche, and she is well mannered without being crude, obnoxious or greedy.  Things ring true in the US as well, as I'm sure they do in every country.  Join the right country clubs, get the prestigious jobs, make sure your kids outshine the neighbors' kids in their endevors, and whatever you do, always keep up with the Joneses.  Does it equal happiness?  I guess to some people it does.  But this show makes us laugh at those who are smart enough to see that's not what it's all about.",1125619200,7,1820,4.509146341463414

Writing ""This show is totally awsome and perfect!!"" might get me more votes, but would hardly be ""helpful"".

For those not familiar with the program, Keeping Up Appearances is a British Sitcom that ran from the early-to-mid 90's, and follows the daily escapades of one Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet of course), and her extended family and neighbors.

The main character, Hyacinth is played by the legendary English stage actress Patricia Routledge, and what a marvelous performance it is. With Hyacinth, Mrs Routledge has given us one of the funniest and most memorable ladies in television history. The bulk of the shows are centered around her (rightfully so), and her escapades as the world's most annoying neighbor. Hyacinth, you see, is an upper middle-class housewife whose primary goal in life is to join the ranks of the upper-crust society matrons and aristocracy, and virtually all of the episodes revolve around her dogged pursuit of impressing those around her with her taste and upper-class elegance.

Her pursuits are usually frustrated by her long-suffering husband's middle-class income, and by the intrusion of her lower-working class relatives (picture a U.K. version of the Rosanne bunch). Several of the episodes center on her lovable but slovenly sisters repeatedly foiling her attempts to ingratiate herself into high-society by...well..showing-up at inopportune moments and embarrassing her.

The supporting cast is absolutely wonderful. Clive Swift, as the poor, henpecked husband Richard is a delight as a man who long-ago decided that a nod and a weary aquiescence was better than a heart attack at 40. His quiet and mannered Richard is an ideal comedic foil for the bombastic Hyacinth. Her boisterous and self-absorbed character might get to be a bit much without his dry and charming demeanor for balance.

The world of KUA is populated with a wealth of funny and memorable characters, my favorite, of whom is Elizabeth, the long-suffering, timid neighbor who is constantly terrorized by the overbearing Hyacinth. With her trembling nerves and ernormous ""bug-eyes"", she reminds me of a human version of Beaker from the Muppet Show. Yes, that was actually a complement.

No doubt you've heard many times, of the debate on whether U.S. audiences will ""get"" British humor. The majority of times the debate is silly. With the enormous popularity of Monty Python, Mr. Bean and many others in the states, it shows that mostly, humor is indeed universal. However, if there ever was British humor some Americans might not ""get"", it would be Keeping Up Appearances. The reason being that much of the comedy of the series is based on the idea that the entire neighborhood lives in abject fear of having to talk to Hyacinth and listen to her boring and vacuous prattle. They will dive behind bushes and vault over hedges in order to avoid being seen by her and thereby risk having to be invited to one of her infamous candlelight suppers.

The British, of course, are famously honest about their dread of embarrassment or discomfort in social situations. Monty Python has done numerous sketches on the subject. Americans, on the other hand, generally don't suffer from this cultural malady, and may find themselves wondering why people just don't tell her to shut up. Some U.S. viewers unaware of this uniquely English quirk may not understand why everyone is in fear of Hyacinth, but we anglophiles certainly do.

The makers of the DVD set have also provided far more in the way of extras than is normally the case with TV season sets. Each and every disc contains a blooper reel as well as a neat set of interviews with the cast, or a tv special on Patricia Routledge's career, etc.

So what's the downside? Well, it's simply repetition. A LOT of it.

The producers and/or writers of the show, whether out of expedience, laziness, or some misguided idea, have decided to take the idea of the ""running gag"" to often exasperating lengths. Over the course of the 8-disc set of episodes you will see the gag with Hyacinth being barked-at by her brother-in-law's dog and falling into the hedge from suprise, repeated at least 10 times. You will see the plot of at least 5 episodes based around her senile father running away from home. You will see Elizabeth spill her coffee from nervousness at least 20 times. You will hear Elizabeth's brother Emmett say the line ""I hope she doesn't sing at me. I hate it when she sings at me"" repeated in virtually every episode. You will see virtually the identical scene of Hyacinth telling poor Richard how to drive at least 13 times. You will hear Hyacinth loudly proclaim when the phone rings..""It's my sister Violet. The one with the Mercedes and a sauna and room for a pony!"" at least 25 times.

Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with the old running gag, but this series has taken the tradition to often absurd lengths. Am I really supposed to laugh the 10th time Hyacinth is startled by the barking dog? Apparently.

These shows, of course were originally broadcast weekly, over 6 years, with months between seasons, and meant to be seen that way. When you watch several back-to-back courtesy of home video, these flaws become much more apparent.

My advice is to buy this set, as the show overall is very charming and can be very, very funny. So funny, in fact, that I still give it 4 stars even with all the repetition I complained-of, and I still enjoyed it far more than the adolescent, low-brow schlock passing for comedy in the U.S.

After all, I would still rather see something funny repeated than something unfunny once. But you may want to limit yourself to one or two episodes per week, otherwise your eyes may start rolling like mine did at the 57th straight ""Onslow won't get busy with his wife"" joke.",1125014400,22,6039,4.89628180039139

2093709,5,B0002F6BTC,"I'll admit that when I first saw Keeping Up Appearances, I found it a bit weird, but in a funny way. As I continued watching on PBS week after week,I began to understand it more, and it got funnier and funnier. Just watching Hyacinth Bucket mentally torture her neighbors, family, and friends, and pretending she's part of royalty, is enough to make me laugh in pain every time. Onslow, Rose, Daisy, Emmet, and Elizabeth are amazing characters that highly complement the character of Hyacinth. Though the series run was short, I do wish they could've continued for 3 or 4 additional seasons.

Keeping Up Appearances, to me, is just as funny as ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" or a bit better. This show was much more enjoyable than most US shows that I watch, seeing as how I live in America. Patricia Routledge truly shined in each and every episode, and gives a phenomenal example of what a high-quality television character looks and acts like.

The writers and producers of the show did such a fantastic job. The show was placed into the perfect setting, the choice of actors and actresses chosen to play the respective parts, couldn't have been any better. Of course those who are into comedies with constant crude/foul language or comedies specifically made for ethnic audiences will not understand. Those of you who are into classy comedy, will enjoy this series with pleasure.

Trust me, after a few episodes, you'll be hooked on Hyacinth and

""Keeping Up Appearances""

I grew up watching sitcoms like Full House, The Cosby Show, Saved By The Bell, The Wonder Years, and Three's Company.  Not until just this year have I even seen a BBC sitcom.  I have always totally adored British accents and loved the way the British talk and have always found England to be so much better than the U.S. as far as artistic architecture and the way they design the interior of buildings just from what I've seen and read.  But I never knew how the British sitcoms were until just a few months ago.

I was at a friends' house and they just changed the TV channel to this show that I knew was British just from seeing it but had no idea which sitcom it was.  It was where Hyacinth was going to pick up Mrs. Fortescue and driving her somewhere and at first I thought Richard was her servant because of the way she told him what to do but then realized he was her husband.  Anyway, seeing Hyacinth not being able to make up her mind once she got to the house just totally cracked me up!  First Hyacinth was going to go to the front door, then she decides to wait by the car, then in the car, then by the garden.  It's just so funny how she couldn't make up her mind.  I was wondering what show that was for a while and then finally I found out and bought this collection just last week.  I just totally laugh at every episode because it's so funny!!  I love the way Hyacinth always answers the phone ""The Bucket residence, the lady of the house speaking!!""

I don't know why they had to cancel this sitcom because I am actually loving this more than almost every other sitcom ever made!!  I really love how the British sitcoms are more than American sitcoms!!  I love how Hyacinth is always so loud and excited and always thinks people just love her and how she always tells Richard what to do, it's just funny!!  Of course, in real life I would never treat my husband like that but for a sitcom it's just hilarious!!!  And Onslow is just a perfect couch potato, how he always just sits and watches TV.  Hyacinth's neighbours Elizabeth and Emmitt are always so scared of Hyacinth that they always try to leave the house by either sneaking or leaving after Hyacinth has left.  I swear even my favorite American sitcoms have never made me laugh like Keeping Up Appearances has!!  Patricia Routledge who plays Hyacinth is an amazing actress and she is so funny and wish the show was still running because you don't see sitcoms like this anymore and I just totally love this sitcom!!

Another favorite that I also started watching is Are You Being Served? and I really wish that was still showing as well.  And for years I've heard of Judi Dench and just recently started watching As Time Goes By as well.  Judi Dench is also amazing. I really love these British sitcoms so much especially Keeping Up Appearances and Are You Being Served? and As Time Goes By with Judi Dench and now all I can do is watch the DVD's or see re-runs on PBS.  I really do wish that they would return Keeping Up Appearances because in my opinion, it beats any American sitcom any day!!  I didn't realize what I've been missing all these 26 years of living, living in the U.S. but now that I've discovered the British way of sitcoms, I'll never turn back!!!  If only there were more Candlelit Suppers!!",1120608000,13,3362,4.347756410256411

8027754,1,B0002F6BTC,I ordered this set for my parents in October and saved it to give as a Christmas gift. They tried to watch it in January and we discovered that these DVDs won't play on their DVD player. I was told that I couldn't return it because it was past 30 days. Of course it's past 30 days because I got an early start on my Christmas shopping. My parents love sitting up late and watching this show when it's on so I scoured the Internet trying to find it for them to make it a special surprise gift. When I found out I couldn't return it I would have then been satisfied if I could at least exchange it for something else they'd enjoy and I was told that's not possible either. Not sure why considering they'd still have the money I spent but now I'm out the money and have nothing to show for it except a DVD set that nobody can watch. So much for that Christmas gift.,1516060800,,862,4.076470588235294
