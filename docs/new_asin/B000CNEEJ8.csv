8099366,2,B000CNEEJ8,"This video is about 10 minutes of rudimentary and basic techniques, stretched into a seeming eternity of repeats. He shows a stick technique, then replays it from different angles (or even the same angle) a few times, and then shows the same technique with a tonfa...or maybe empty handed...etc. The techniques are okay, but if you practice any style of Filipino martial arts, there's nothing new here.

It shows no drills, principles, or concepts behind his style of Kali.

I'll give the benefit of the doubt and assume his staccato rhythm was purely for demonstration purposes of the technique, but overall this was very unimpressive, and a huge waste of time and money.

I give it two stars, as it MIGHT be interesting to people with no background in Southeast Asian Martial Arts.",1241395200,,783,4.87218045112782
