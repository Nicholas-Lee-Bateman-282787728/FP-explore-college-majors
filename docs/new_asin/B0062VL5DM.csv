UFC 138 was an excellent event overall and I thought that despite the hype of Diaz's return the card itself overall was decent. Ufc 138 doesn't have any of the normal bonus features like the countdown show, the weigh-ins, or behind the scenes but Ufc 137 has all the normal bonus features in this 3 disk set.",1338508800,,391,4.36986301369863
8491540,5,B0062VL5DM,"I will be the 1st to admit that when the UFC 137 card lost the first main event of GSP v Diaz along with a great Co-Main Event of Penn v Condit I was worried but little did I know that when they GSP got hurt and the main event became Penn v Diaz, It seemed that both Penn and Diaz brought their A games and F.O.T.Y canidate with 2 ultra solid boxers who had a 3 round slugfest. UFC 138's main event was subpar but since they are giving you both UFC 137/138 as a 2 for 1 this a great buy.",1327104000,2,487,3.737864077669903

While the value of getting two pay-per-views typically looks good initially this is typically due to the fact that both pay-per-views did not live up to the expectations had of them.  While this is partially true of this particular release it's definitely a strong release for a few good reasons.

BJ Penn taking on Nick Diaz had all the makings of fight of the year. The hype on talent alone was ridiculous and I can safely say that this fight delivered on that at least. The first round was pretty evenly matched although one fighter looked to be landing the harder shots. Then in the second something of a 180 occurred and the one fighter ended up putting on a fantastic performance in what looked like a definite finish but it continued into the third with very similar results. I was definitely impressed with one fighter and kinda sad to see how the other performed. Overall a decent fight but nowhere near enough to save this pay-per-view.

Chris Leben and Mark Muoz made history by fighting in the first five round non-title bout in UFC's history. Given that those were the circumstances the fight doesn't play out that way. With heavy hitters such as these two I wasn't expecting anything past three rounds so I wasn't entirely surprised to see it end before hitting the the typical championship rounds. Although the ending was not to my liking the fight itself was just as I had hoped, a fun all out brawl with both fighters landing some absolutely brutal shots on each other. The victor made a strong case for entering the top middleweights in line for a title shot at Anderson Silva.

I'll admit, UFC 137 sucked as a pay-per-view (my own opinion of course).  The original main event was supposed to be Georges St-Pierre vs. Carlos Condit for the Welterweight title but St-Pierre sustained an injury two weeks before the event so they had to scrap it.  Not only that but many of the fights on the main card were three round decisions that simply had no pop (especially the co-main event).  With the exception of Penn/Diaz there was nothing really all that spectacular, although the fight between Mirko Cro Cop and Roy Nelson definitely had its fun moments.

Now UFC 138 was actually a really good event.  Its main problem however comes from that fact that it has very little drawing power in terms of big name talents.  Many fans will recognize Chris Leben from the first season of the Ultimate Fighter but most of the other fighters will probably go unnoticed to the casual fan.  Unfortunately for a lot of people who dismissed this card missed out on all kinds of fun.  Loaded with a number of great finishes (some of the best all year) this main card had just about every type of fight you could wish for.  Definitely a good card to pack with the lackluster UFC 137, as it gives this bundle some needed quality fights.

Overall, not the greatest two events in the history of the sport but UFC 137 had some absolutely monumental moments (the retirement of two loved warriors) and the one of the best showings all year in just plain action from UFC 138.  Definitely a bundle worth checking out but if you still feel unsure try and check out the events to decide for yourself.",1324252800,4,3238,4.595486111111111
