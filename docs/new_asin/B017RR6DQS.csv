7515955,1,B017RR6DQS,"Sorry, thought Kill Kane was atrocious.  IMO, the acting didn't meet ""Little Theatre"" standards.
Yes, you can understand PE teacher Kane wanting to avenge the murders of his wife, son, & daughter.
Too bad Vinnie Jones' (Kane) acting wasn't even halfway comparable to Charles Bronson's or Mel Gibson's acting in their ""avenger"" films.
To be fair, a poor script & poor direction may have impeded Jones' attempts to present a compelling character (just maybe).
Why do script writers think screaming the ""F"" and ""C"" words, repetitiously, equates to believable, enjoyable dialogue?
If it were possible, this post would be zero stars.",1461715200,,628,5.217821782178218

7515957,3,B017RR6DQS,"Adam Stephen Kelly made his directorial debut with Kill Kane, a brutal British crime thriller about revenge.  Andrew Jones, Christian Sellers, and Adam Stephen Kelly penned the screenplay that synthesizes elements of the Charles Bronson movie Death Wish and the Steven Seagal movie Hard to Kill.  Clocking in at 74-minutes, this grim bit of business doesnt beat about the bush.

Our resilient hero gets lost while driving around on a family outing and pulls over to fish a map out of the trunk of his car.  He witnesses--through a hole in a fence--the execution slaying of a low-life criminal, Tommy (Mitchell Fisher), in a backlot.  Poor Tommyit seemssuffered from loose lips, talking too much about his own gang.  Before Noonan (Dan Richardson of Retribution) pulls the trigger on a kneeling Tommy, he comments  But sometimes a potter has got to know that the clay hes working with is just no good. Unfortunately, the villains spotted the van that our father figure, a gym teacher Ray Brookes (Vinnie Jones of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) who has been teaching for fifteen years.  Miraculously, Ray survived a fatal gunshot wound and spent three months in a coma.  This is where Kill Kane opens as Ray recovers in the high dependency unit of a local hospital.  Of course, Ray refuses to cooperate with the authorities because he believes that they cannot offer him adequate protection from the gangsters.  British Detective Inspector Shelby (Sebastian Street of Vehemence) questions Ray about the criminals, but Ray keeps his mouth shut.  After he recovers from his coma, Ray has to contend with Shelby again, who wants him to testify against the criminal.  Ray turns him down.  Ray hunts down Billy Malone (newcomer Benjamin Way) and stabs him to death.  Afterward, he catches up with the dastard, Conner OBrien (Conor Boru of Spiked), who capped his daughter Victoria Brookes (Sarah Alexandra Marks of Illegal Activity) at point blank range in the head.  Ray tangles with the ringleader of the ruffians, Kill Keegan (creepy looking Sean Cronin of The World Is Not Enough), but Shelby intervenes in their standoff showdown.  He tries to convince Ray to stand down, but our protagonist guns Kane down while Shelby watches.  Shelby advises Kane to clear out of town.  Predictably, Kane ignores Shelby and shows up the next day at Frank Noonans bar where he confronts Noonan (Dan Richardson of Retribution) and blows his head off.

Mind you, Kill Kane is not a lighthearted lark.  Murderers with no qualms about killing shoot harmless innocents at close range, and we see lots of bleeding head wounds.  Jones is his usual brawny self, but he elicits sympathy as the father left without a family.  Meantime, Cronin makes a terrific villain.  Reminiscent of the Michael Caine gangster movie Get Carter, except Vinnie survives the fracas.  This no-nonsense crime thriller isn't as awful as some of the user critics claim.  Of course, it is no masterpiece, but director Adam Stephen Kelly doesnt bore us with a lot of meaningless details.  He goes for the gut and Kill Kane is formulaic but nevertheless tolerable.",1457481600,4,3119,4.982591876208898
8740360,3,B017RR6DQS,"Not bad. Found it interesting that the Brits would make a movie like this. They seem so anti gun. Maybe this is the start of them coming around to our way of thinking. This is a very ""Death Wish"" type movie. I wonder if it's too late for them to get any rights back? I hear they are losing the right to any free speech now. That their government has more cops running down and arresting people for wrong think on TV and social media then hunting for terrorist or other crimes. Well that would make you want a movie like this.",1518480000,,525,4.1568627450980395

8740364,2,B017RR6DQS,"The Punisher and Paul Kersey he ain't.  Vinnie Jones is a lot of things but Charles Bronson he's not.

This movie is pretty lame as a movie.  There are a lot of similarities between The Punisher and Death Wish, mostly in the scenario.  Guy's family gets killed, guy pays 'em back.  Beyond that, that's the movie in a nutshell.",1471046400,,326,4.4576271186440675
