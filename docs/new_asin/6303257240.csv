607982,3,6303257240,"In ""Shamus,"" Burt Reynolds is a New York private eye afraid of big dogs and keeps a beautiful ginger cat...

He lives in a single room and sleeps on a pool table... He is quite capable of pushing a heroin addict's face into the garbage... He is certainly the 1970's version - almost in comic-strip - of the private investigator...

Reynolds lives cheaply, yet is hired to pursue a theft of diamonds; he is big and sexy, and the gorgeous Dyan Cannon is only too happy to dally with him at the drop of a clue; and he is apparently so tough that he can take all manner of beatings and emerge unscathed...

It is doubtful if he is the sort of man one would want to introduce to one's maiden aunt (the one with all the money), but he is certainly a character to fulfill all the audience's fantasies of violence, sex and thrills...",1168560000,5,825,4.309677419354839

607984,4,6303257240,"This movie was made at the start of Burt Reynold's stardom.  He plays a down-on-his-luck P.I. (granted, not a very original concept), but Burt was born for this role as the wise-cracking, street smart detective.  A character actor named Ron Weyand who plays E.J. Hume, Burt's client in the plot, steals every scene he is in - this guy is amazing and I wonder why his screen work is so limited?  Anyway, this is a fast-paced drama with plenty of interesting characters and some good laughs too.",1143244800,3,493,4.64367816091954
607985,3,6303257240,"This movie happened just as Burt Reynold's star was starting to shine. It was before he got caught in formula driven audience (of the time) pleasers, and it's an example of one of the things he did best. You can add this to Deliverance, Sharkey's Machine  and Starting Over as the ones he hit out of the park.

It updates the down and out private investigator tale, and it does it with a gritty, contemporary style. Reynolds is believable, witty and tough (his stuntman days kick in here and much of what we see on screen- including that fall, is him).

The story is well crafted (and pre-Iran/Contra- which make it really interesting- the 'sales pitch scene' at the army base being priceless). It came and went pretty fast in the theatres but it had some real style that was overlooked. The lines are witty: "" Why did you pick me? "" "" You weren't the first choice. "" "" Oh... 2nd or 3rd? "" "" No... the 56th. "" "" Next time lie, okay? ""

Dyan Cannon balances Reynolds, and the rest of the support cast play the mood out well. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it a real bounce, too. Morris the Cat from the famous old commercials even does a guest stint as Reynold's cat (no voice overs, though), and the film offers an interesting example of how diverse a pool table can be!

If you didn't like Reynold's work, watch this and you'll like him in this. If you did like him... watch this and enjoy what he did best. This is a good PI picture with a story that had some reality to it. It makes you laugh but gets you nervous about whose minding the store at your local army base!",1099612800,12,1569,4.287162162162162
607986,3,6303257240,"Shamus is not a great PI movie -like say The Big Sleep or The Maltese Falcon ;nor is it an especially good one but it is briskly paced ,with plenty of decently staged action scenes that divert attention from a convoluted and not especially believable plot.
The eponymous private eye is McCoy -played winningly by Reynolds-who is based in Brooklyn and whose economic state is more than a little parlous. His apartment ,like his wardrobe ,is sparsely furnished -he sleeps on a pool table in fact. A serial womaniser with a line of chat that was probably okay in the era the movie was made ,but now seems distinctly cheesy Mccoy is likeable and a personable man with the usual line of smart one lineres that is an essential part of any fictional pi's armourey
He is engaged by a millionaire to trace the whereabouts of diamonds stolen during a recent robbery/murder. In the course of the investigation he is shot at ;beaten up;is chased and chases bad guys across Brooklyn by foot and by car before a lively climax at a US army base where illicit arms deals are going down. Some measure of compensation is provided by the delectable Dyan Cannon with whom he falls in love.
It was perhaps unwise of the writers to evoke The Big Sleep in the scenes with Mccoy's employer -just as that classic saw the tec being engaged by a client with a passion for heat ,the millionaire here is a man who insists on near freezing conditions.
Best sit back and enjoy it for what it is -a star vehicle that gets by on action and solid playing all round while never rising above the acceptable.",1058745600,4,1571,4.515789473684211
607987,3,6303257240,"If you have a weakness for early seventies/sexist/private eye B movies like me, this is about as good as it gets.  It's not especially believable, but it takes itself less seriously than most modern superthrillers, i.e. Die Hards, Lethal Weapons.  Actually, Reynolds gives a pretty good performance.  Self deprecating, funny and, (seriously) believably tough.  I don't think he lost his perspective until Smokey and the Bandit.  Shamus is very much a product of its time; his character beds three different women in the course of the film, something that Hollywood now only allows in French farces and James Bond films.
I liked Dyan Cannon in the film.  She didn't have a whole lot to do as ""the girl"" in the film, but she did bring a certain amount of class to the role.  The romance between her and Reynolds was believable.  It's somewhat sad, because were the film made today, she would likely have been, at around 33, too old to play the part of the girl.  Instead, they'd seek out someone like Rachel Leigh Cook or other nineteen year old babe which would make for a rather unbelievable romantic subtext.  Such are the feminist advances Hollywood has made.
Good score by Jerry Goldsmith, too.  Good entertainment for a cold winter night.",990576000,5,1242,4.811320754716981
607988,3,6303257240,"Burt Reynolds gets beat up so much in this film, it's a wonder he can make love to Dyan Cannon on top of a pool table mid-movie! A convoluted action-genre exercise designed to show off it's star, and Reynolds is very low-key, self-depreciating, and sexy in his Cosmo-pin-up era. Dyan Cannon looks even better, though she's given little to do as a woman involved second-hand in a murder. Pretty good for a one-time viewing, but I wouldn't buy it.",978307200,9,445,4.6455696202531644

7841913,3,6303257240,"Opening with a couple being burned to death with a flame thrower, the crime drama Shamus (1972) features a number of tough action scenes, as star Burt Reynolds (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Longest-Yard/dp/B00AEFYJ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Longest Yard</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sharky-s-Machine/dp/6305133433/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sharky's Machine</a>) performs most of his own stunts, playing private detective Shamus McCoy, hired by a wealthy eccentric (Ron Weyland) to recover some stolen diamonds.

Set in New York City, the film features many gritty parts of the city, and some ""colorful"" local characters.  Supporting players include a giggly Dyan Cannon, and Joe Santos.  The story relies a bit too much on clich, but Reynolds holds the film together with an engaging acting performance, and a maximum effort in the various action scenes.

7841916,2,6303257240,"Shamus, 1972 film

A man calls a private investigator to do a job. Can a pool table be used as bed? [Beds are placed at knee level.] This seems to be a one-room apartment. [Like a shack or low-rent NY tenement?] His bed-mate awakes. Alice is told to let his cat in, and be gone by noon. [What man wakes in the morning without needing a shave?] McCoy drive to a large mansion that is guarded by a large dog. He enters a cold room. There was a burglary of diamonds. The man believed to be responsible was found dead. His job is to find out who killed him for $10,000. [A lot more money then.] McCoy visits an apartment, there is violence, and he gets his answers. He goes to a ""health club"" in the Village. It is crowded. McCoy gets information about Bolton. He visits a book store and talks about books. Later he fights with a man to get information. Man grab him at night to beat him and tell him to forget about Pappas. He is told about Montane. Where did he get the money? McCoy goes to a building on Sutton Place to see Felix and meets his sister.

They talk about Pappas. McCoy drives on the West Side. He visits a restaurant and dines. Can they find out more about Pappas? What about the guys that beat up McCoy? Felix's sister asks McCoy to follow him. Who lent the money to Felix? McCoy goes to investigate that warehouse. Breaking and entering? He is discovered! There is more action as men with pistols chase him! Back home he meets Felix's sister. Then his employer, where McCoy quits. Men take him to a warehouse to view a body! He is warned about his possible fate. Felix often dined with Lt. Col. Hardcore about business. McCoy visits Hardcore about buying surplus military supplies. Some men shoot at them, but they escape. McCoy visits that eccentric millionaire where he finds Felix. Will both of them be eliminated? That large dog disarms McCoy. There is an unexpected event and McCoy escapes. He is hunted among the shrubbery. He runs away and dodges bullets. The shots bring the police. They collect the survivors. McCoy returns to his room. Alexis leaves. And so it ends.

This isn't much of a story. There have been plenty of private investigator movies over the years. Most military equipment is sold by the US government to foreign nations, and is often used against their subjects or a neighboring country (also armed by the USA). You need a good story for a food movie.",1376352000,,2394,4.461187214611872
7841917,4,6303257240,"Burt Reynolds is McCoy, a private detective that seduces women, roughs up lowlifes and sleeps on a pool table. The plot is a contrived mix of Raymond Chandler and Shaft, but no matter. Burt is bringing the cool and the pleasures in this movie are derived from straight-banging, unapologetic machismo. A flick like this could not be made today without major compromises. McCoy would be softer, more boyish looking, fully in touch with his feelings. In short, he wouldn't be allowed to strangle people with chains to obtain information. Shamus is admittedly an odd mixture of hard action and light humor, and the ending is a mad scramble, but fans of hard edged 70's Burt vehicles like The Longest Yard and White Lightning should respond to it. And it goes very well with pizza and beer.",1296259200,7,785,4.779411764705882
