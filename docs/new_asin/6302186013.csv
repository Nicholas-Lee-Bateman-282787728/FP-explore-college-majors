7822131,5,6302186013,"I've only seen it once, but this film left an indelible mark on me. Even if you don't know anything about Makarova when you start out, you will find this intimate story of her career during the Cold War compelling. As a dancer and a filmmaker, I enjoyed how well the technical, political, and personal sides of the story were all woven together. The filmmaker especially does a wonderful job allowing Makarova to articulate her feelings. If you have a dancer in your family and you can't understand what motivates him/her, Makarova may help you! Definitely something worth seeing and adding to your arts/dance library. I wish it were available on DVD!",1297036800,3,651,4.821428571428571
7822132,4,6302186013,"This is a very interesting documentary on Natasha Makarova's return to Leningrad after having defected years earlier. While most of it will only interest die hard Makarova fans, the extended clip of ""Eugene  Oneign"" at the Kirov will thrill all.",960681600,5,245,5.125
