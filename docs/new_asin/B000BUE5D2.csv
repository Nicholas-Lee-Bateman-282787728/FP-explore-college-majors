2442213,5,B000BUE5D2,"Well,I am from Portugal and I was a kid when i first watched the series on the tv. The truth is that i loved,and that's why i bought this season and the last two as well,because they are really good. I am waiting for season four.",1142640000,4,229,4.0
2442214,4,B000BUE5D2,"This 1984-85 Season DVD is mighty cool and my favorite season throughout KNIGHT RIDER's whole 4-year run on NBC, especially since every episode on this DVD is complete and uncut like they all were originally shown when KNIGHT RIDER was on NBC every Sunday many years ago, but they took a lot of the sound effects out in many scenes of the episodes, like they did in the episodes ""Knight Of The Chameleon"" and ""Knightlines"" for instance, but if you watch those same episodes on the KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD that Universal released in the Fall of 2008, you'll notice a difference and hear the sound effects in every single scene like they should be, which was probably something else that prompted Universal to make and release the KNIGHT RIDER-The Complete Series DVD box set by redoing each episode on single-sided discs instead of putting them on double-sided discs like they did on this KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 3 DVD box set along with all the other individual season box sets, which made a lot of episodes freeze and skip a lot in those box sets, especially in the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2 DVD box set and the KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4 DVD box set since the episodes ""Knightmares"", ""Knight Song"", ""White-Line Warriors"", and ""Deadly Knightshade"" froze and skipped a lot on the individual season box sets, which was probably due to them being on double-sided discs which is probably why Universal doesn't make their television DVD box sets with double-sided discs anymore and why they've only been making them on single-sided disks for the passed 3 years now.

This was also the season when KITT gets a major upgrade and a major facelift with a new dashboard with more souped up new features that KITT didn't have in the first 2 seasons, including a lit up accelerator and features on the car that lit up more.

The Third Season is also the Season is also when Bonnie Barstow(Patricia McPherson) comes back to the show as KITT's technician giving KITT a serious upgrade from the first 2 seasons, but they should've used the proper introduction to the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode like they used on NBC, since ""Knight Of The Drones"" was the last episode where KITT had his old dashboard before Bonnie gave KITT his new upgraded dashboard after KITT gets blown up from a hasty accident that nearly destroyed KITT in the process, but I personally like the 3rd Season of KNIGHT RIDER the best out of it's whole 4-year run on NBC.

This 1984-1985 Season is also the season when KITT's evil prototype KARR returns with a vengence in the ""KITT vs. KARR"" episode, except KARR is even more upgraded than he was in the ""Trust Doesn't Rust"" episode.

In addition to the K.I.T.T. Vs. K.A.R.R. episode, I also noticed that they used the older Trans Ams with KITT's old dashboard to play KARR, since KARR never got a new dashboard, unlike KITT.

Therefore, KARR wasn't as upgraded as KITT was in the KITT vs. KARR episode and had less features than KITT did, since KITT didn't have as many features in the first 2 seasons as he did in the 3rd Season.

Therefore, in a way it was almost as if it was KITT with the new dashboard vs. KITT with the old dashboard, since they were showing KARR just like KITT was in the 2nd Season.

This is also the season when the reclusive Michael(David Hasselhoff) and KITT battle cattle rustlers using monster trucks to help them do their dirty work, which made it a lot like a KITT vs. Big Foot episode, which was quite intriguing, since I always wondered to myself when I was little how it would be like if Knight Rider went up against the famous BIG FOOT monster truck.

Unfortunately, this 1984-85 Season wasn't as strong as the first 2 seasons were especially since this show was obviously no longer in its honeymoon phase anymore since KNIGHT RIDER was starting to get overshadowed by the premiere of the short-lived STREET HAWK since it started giving viewers too much of the same thing every week back in the Winter of '85 since STREET HAWK & AIRWOLF were quite similar to KNIGHT RIDER which resulted in this show getting a slight decline in ratings in this season, especially since STREET HAWK had stole KITT's thunder along with the fact that Street Hawk & its rider(Jesse Mach)had stole ""The Man, The Machine"" motto away from Michael Knight & KITT when STREET HAWK made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985 since ABC had STREET HAWK on every Friday night, CBS had AIRWOLF every Saturday night, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER every Sunday night which started getting viewers too much competition & redundancy every week since they were all too closely related to each other, especially since all 3 Universal TV shows premiered too soon after one another too since KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF had made its debut in the Winter of 1984, and STREET HAWK made its debut on ABC in the Winter of 1985, despite the fact that the creation and premiere of both STREET HAWK and AIRWOLF were inspired by the creation and premiere of KNIGHT RIDER since KITT was the first phenomenal futuristic autmobile in television history at the time.

Therefore, without KNIGHT RIDER, there wouldn't have been any AIRWOLF or STREET HAWK.

Unfortunately, STREET HAWK nearly killed this show & stole a lot of KNIGHT RIDERs viewers away basically beating KNIGHT RIDER to a pulp since STREET HAWK was more high-tech & more advanced with more upgraded features that outclassed the Knight 2000 big time K.O.ing KNIGHT RIDER in the ratings especially with STREET HAWKs hyperthrust speed feature that KITT didn't even have, despite the fact that KNIGHT RIDER lasted a lot longer than STREET HAWK did & even longer than AIRWOLF did, especially since STREET HAWK didn't even last a year despite the fact that STREET HAWK also ended up leading to the cancellation of KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF in the Summer of 1986 after STREET HAWK led to its own cancellation in the Spring of 1985 since STREET HAWK didn't get the ratings ABC wanted.

Fortunately, KNIGHT RIDER stayed on the air and started another season in the Fall of 1985 while STREET HAWK was already long gone and axed, which made me glad since I always preferred KNIGHT RIDER to STREET HAWK anyways and I personally was never as fond of STREET HAWK in the first place either.

Therefore, I was so happy when STREET HAWK was given the boot after only being on ABC for 3 1/2 months before it was cancelled permanently in June of 1985.

In other words, STREET HAWK was a short-lived TV show that didn't even last, unlike KNIGHT RIDER and AIRWOLF, due to poor ratings, but the ratings on rival shows AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER were still going strong.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Jared Martin in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Alan Feinstein in the ""Knights Of The Fast Lane"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL & SANTA BARBARA

*Jeff Osterhage in the ""KITT Vs. KARR"" episode before his co-starring days as Detective Sgt. Vic Daniels on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET

*Barbara Stock in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode before her co-starring days on DALLAS and SPENCER FOR HIRE

*Jason Bateman during his co-starring days on IT'S YOUR MOVE and after his co-starring days as Derrick Taylor on SILVER SPOONS and before his co-starring days as David Hogan on THE HOGAN FAMILY

*Kimberly Foster in the ""Knight Of The Chameleon"" episode during her co-starring days on DALLAS

*James Luisi in the ""Custom Made Killer"" episode after his co-starring days as Becker's disgruntled superior officer(Lt. Chapman) on the ROCKFORD FILES & during his co-starring days on the soap operas DAYS OF OUR LIVES & ANOTHER WORLD

*Bernard White in the ""Buy Out"" episode before his co-starring days as Sgt. Carl Molina on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET

*Richard Herd in the ""Knight Strike"" episode after his co-starring days as Hooker's hard-nosed superior officer(Capt. Dennis Sheridan) on the police drama TJ HOOKER

*David Hedison in the ""Knight In Retreat"" episode after his co-starring days on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

I also liked the way Universal has provided a brief summary along with their original air-dates too.
For instance, the original air-date to each of these 1984-1985 Season episodes was
9/30/84-KNIGHT OF THE DRONES
10/7/84-ICE BANDITS
10/14/84-KNIGHTS OF THE FAST LANE
10/28/84-HALLOWEEN KNIGHT
11/4/84-KITT VS. KARR
11/11/84-THE ROTTEN APPLES
11/18/84-KNIGHT IN DISGRACE
12/2/84-DEAD OF KNIGHT
12/9/84-LOST KNIGHT
12/30/84-KNIGHT OF THE CHAMELEON
1/6/85-CUSTOM MADE KILLER
1/13/85-KNIGHT BY A NOSE
2/3/85-JUNK YARD DOG
2/10/85-BUY OUT

3/29/85-KNIGHT IN RETREAT
4/5/85-KNIGHT STRIKE
5/5/85-CIRCUS KNIGHTS

This 1984-85 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when I used to watch KNIGHT RIDER every Sunday night on NBC when it was part of NBC's Sunday night line-up, which started with SILVER SPOONS at 7PM, PUNKY BREWSTER at 7:30 PM, and then topped off with KNIGHT RIDER at 8PM, which was of course before NBC had briefly moved KNIGHT RIDER back to Fridays in the Spring of 1985, then NBC changed their minds and decided to movie it back to Sundays in mid April of 1985, but was later moved back to Fridays permanently in the Summer of 1985 just before KNIGHT RIDER kicked off it's 4th Season.

Something else I noticed on this KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 3 DVD was Cozi-TV, USA, WGN, and the Sci-Fi Channel had deleted too many scenes in the episodes ""Knight Of The Drones"", ""Knight Of The Chameleon"", ""Junk Yard Dog"", ""Knight & Knerd"", ""Ice Bandits"", etc., in order to allot more time for added commercials in between each episode, but it was so nice being able to see each and every episode complete and uncut like they were shown originally on their original air-dates on NBC before they were even converted into reruns on cable TV and in syndication.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBC: Let's All Be There"", since that was NBC's slogan from June of 1984 thru August of 1986.  So way to go Universal. Hooray!

By the way, Shout will be releasing the short-lived STREET HAWK with Rex Smith(Jesse Mach)out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 for all you high-tech classic TV show fans out there.",1141948800,5,10340,4.803038829487901
2442215,5,B000BUE5D2,Thanks for making available the Knight Rider series on DVD.  It really brings me back to my youth.  Seeing Michael Knight with his really fluffy hair do has the memories come flooding back.  A million thanks!!!!!!,1141776000,4,213,4.861111111111111
2442216,3,B000BUE5D2,"The season starts with a thrilling episode in which KITT gets hit by a rocket in the exhaust that almost destroys him but Bonnie updates the dashboard with new gadgets and lights and designs making him good looking. The Micro Jam function and the green lighted accelerator pedal are into the new functions. The episodes are real good specially KITT Vs KARR Knight and The Chamaleon and Knight in Disgrace. It's a good idea to include a Bonus episode of the last season but I don't like last one. The Super Pursuit Mode and Cabrio button is not very true.

The picture and sound is clear and well defined due the remastering but the transfer in some episodes are not quite good and some sound effects are missing giving that a bad final when watching them. I hope Universal can fix the second disc which is the one that have the issue. I will receive another set but I'm afraid it's the same one because Universal hasn't included these discs yet and retailers can't change them.

In the meantime log on [...] to email them about the problem.

I'm going to watch The A-Team Season 3 now.",1140480000,14,1085,4.49746192893401
2442217,5,B000BUE5D2,"Knight Rider is a classic.  I was merely a baby when it first aired, but feel in love with it in reruns.  It was way before its time content wise.  When i was a kid, it was the car that made the show. Today, when i watch these episodes in season 3 , or any other season, i catch myself being caught up in the stories.  Of course Kitt is still the main attraction, but each episode had a great storyline.  I don't rate one season higher than another, but season 3 has many MANY memorable episodes!",1139356800,2,496,4.072164948453608
2442218,3,B000BUE5D2,"I was really looking forward to season 3 of knight rider of DVD.

most of my favourite episodes are in this season,

Sadly this is the most lamest transfer on to DVD #I have ever seen.

I can accept that they had to replace 2 prince songs because of music rights.

However what I can't except is the clumsy mess up with sound effects.

Only 2 episodes in the entire set are as they should be.

Kitt's engine sound is missing in places buttons sounds are also missing now and then.

The really bad episode in this set is Knight of the chameleon it sounds a chase scene near the beginning sounds totally rubbish. No engine sound no tyre sound.

For an official universal release this is really pathetic.

I hope season 4 isn't messed up like this.

A company like universal should not be making these mistakes in products.",1139097600,30,820,4.406666666666666
2442219,5,B000BUE5D2,"Well, season three is finally here, and it's certainly the best of them all. Many of the stories here and in season two are the ones I remember the best, with memorable stories in season three being KITT -vs- KARR, and of course Halloween Knight, that for some reason I remember being a lot more scary when I first saw it. Oh well.

Anyway, the sound quality is good. It's mono, but is always clear and of consistent volume. The picture quality on the whole is very good, and the boxset does proclaim to have been digitally remastered, and it does show.

Overall, I love it. Five stars!",1139011200,,586,4.416666666666667
2442220,5,B000BUE5D2,"Season three is definitely the best in the Knight Rider series. K.I.T.T. get a cool new dashboard and there is the return of K.A.R.R (K.I.T.T.'s prototype). Also better compared to other seasons are the episode storylines and the working relationships between the main characters: Michael, Devon, and Bonnie (who returns after being absent from the second season).",1137715200,5,364,5.4035087719298245
2442221,5,B000BUE5D2,"This particular season is probably my personal favorite (a true fan I love them all), KITT gets a terrific redesign, Bonnie returns (admittedly I wished they could have kept April too, but well...), and the show finally steps more into the urban landscape-modernizing (at the time)it's look, feel and Hasselhoff's wardrobe and fully abandoning that tired (even for the 80's) middle America demographic. The storylines were always generally fast paced, but the score's heavier emphasis on synthesizers by Don Peake helped to give the show a more lively feel when it counted most. KITT vs KARR, Knights in the Fast Lane, Lost Knight, Dead of Knight are but a few highlights and the most major flaw of this and every other season of the show would be the lack of storylines that transcend several episodes. It was experiemented with in the second season, but more would've definitely given Knight Rider more miles to the gallon...",1133913600,7,927,4.987096774193549
2442222,4,B000BUE5D2,"Finally, Universal has decided to release, in my opinion, the best season of Knight Rider. Season 2 was good, but 3 really shines because KITT gets a better-looking dashboard and KARR comes back. I can't stand Season 4 (Super Pursuit Mode, convertible KITT, and the addition of a new cast member, who, in my opinion, served no real purpose on the show really turned me off to it, although the opener was good).",1133913600,,410,4.63013698630137

As far as the item itself, it comes with a multi-disc case which is very sturdy. The menu system is simple to access and it's overall good work and worth the money if I do say so myself. It may be hard to persuade someone in 2016 to watch this series with the same enthusiasm we had when it first aired, but for us that enjoyed it back in the day... It still holds up.

She had brains and beauty.,1368489600,,345,4.0144927536231885

2442326,5,B000BUE5D2,"Growing up, I watched this show religiously... not so much for the plots or the characters, but for KITT... that awesome, awesome car. Now that I'm a bit older and wiser, looking back, I can definitely understand why this was known as the Hoff's peak period. Knight Rider came to define David Hasselhoff's career for a reason, and even in its moment of 80s era signature cheese, it was a satisfying joy ride of live action crime fighting, gadgetry and stunting.

It's also worth noting that each series package has its own unique extras within the discs, so... no reason not to try to get all four.",1360972800,,598,4.588785046728972

The Final Battle Between Golliath & Kitt. In My Opinion This Series Was A Ground Braking Science Fiction Show. Love Season's One And Two Dont Bother With Season 4",1284249600,2,400,4.647887323943662

2442340,4,B000BUE5D2,"The Knight Rider Season 3 DVD transfer for the Australian market was poor because subtitles were missing and there was only English as a language.
In this release I actually liked the menu better because it looked classy. However we don't get any extras like the US does like commentries or episode synopsis.
The episodes were once again good and storylines were really original and worked. I especially liked the use of turbo boost as the producers really made it more fun this time round. In one episode KITT gets rebuilt. The good thing was it was linked to the first season as they had to source the origins of KITT manufacturer. The show still maintains the excitement as the first two seasons.
I also think the KARR episode, although good to watch initially, had its moments and wasn't fun to watch (pacemaker interference, ATM) with family members. No wonder Micheal was not happy when he first heard about KARR roaming the streets.
Just wished they had made season 5 of this series.. grrh. I could think of lots of ideas for another season but sadly it ended. Will there be a proper remake?",1236297600,,1098,4.664948453608248
2442341,5,B000BUE5D2,"I love Knight Rider season three, and season one is on the way.  As a child I used to watch Knight Rider every Friday night with my family.  It was totally awesome.  In season three I like the Ice Bandits, Knight of the Rising Sun, and Knight by a Nose.  I really like KITT.  I almost didn't want to watch Junk Yard Dog where he gets destroyed; but even that episode has a nice ending.  It's so neat to see how Micheal and his car work together in all of the episodes, helping and encouraging each other.  I would recommend Knight Rider to anyone who grew up in the 80's.",1219363200,,571,4.136363636363637

2442354,4,B000BUE5D2,This was a great series and I feel that season 3 was the best of all 4.  The show really hit its stride in this season.

DVD is meant to bring out the best in media, not the worst, how could they lose sound effects? Unbelievable! Just doesn't seem possible... SEASON 4 is no better...

2442362,4,B000BUE5D2,"Ahhh... The early 1980's. Reagan was president, new wave dominated the radiowaves and MTV actually played MUSIC VIDEOS! Ask anyone who grew up during this period what their favorite non-animated show was as a kid and they'll probably say ""Knight Rider."" KR, as its affectionately called by some fans, may seem quirky and obscure nowadays with its atari centipede sound effects, poofie aqua-net hairdo's, over-acting and ""sooo not the original artist"" song usage, but we didn't care...

To us this was the best thing on TV besides Smurfs and He-Man and it appealed to our parents as well. KR was like James Bond meets Herbie the Love Bug. While our mothers drooled over the blue-eyed hunky Hasselhoff, we were captivated by the ominous-looking but friendly talking black Trans Am, K.I.T.T. (Knight Industries Two Thousand) we giggled everytime theives tried to steal KITT and failed, and we cried when KITT got destroyed (but they -always- managed to rebuild him).

I found Season 3 in the mall for $24. The visual quality of these discs is pretty good. It would've been nicer if they had director/actor interviews and maybe some behind the scenes words with George Barris (the guy who built all the KITT cars for the show) I can't say I care for the double sided discs as they are terribly easy to smudge, but I guess that's the only way they could fit 8 episodes on each DVD.",1143072000,13,1376,4.777310924369748
