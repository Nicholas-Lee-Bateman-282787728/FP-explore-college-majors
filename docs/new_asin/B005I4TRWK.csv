4708221,2,B005I4TRWK,"I bought this workout expecting a totally AWESOME ballet workout experience.  That's not what I got.  Instead I got a workout that barely resembled anything LIKE ballet and was more than a little dull. The exercises are nothing new, but a person new to exercise might find them challenging.  There is no music, and the stretches after each exercise were welcome, but WAY too brief to be effective.  Sorry to be the dissenting voice here, but I couldn't get rid of this one fast enough!",1317686400,13,485,4.670588235294118
4708222,4,B005I4TRWK,"I just tried the BB Classic for the first time yesterday. I had purchased the ""blasts"" from BB website back in the spring,so I had something else to compare this to. The exercises themselves were challenging, but I didn't care for the sequencing. The sequences are as follows:bridge,inner thighs,outer thighs, abs, arms,and standing (which includes plies,tandu?,etc).I believe they are in that order. I know for sure the bridge sequence is first and standing last, which felt a bit odd. I would have liked the standing first bc of the ""warm up"" and cardio factor. Mary Helen wastes no time with the exercises, but there is a pause between sequences. This workout didn't seem to flow. Except for the standing sequence, this is a mat workout. I didn't feel like there was anything new. I prefer her lower body blasts online to these. I love my barre workouts-P57,Booty Barre, Bar Method-and usually compare any workout to these. I always feel like I get my ""exercise time's worth"" with these. workouts. I didn't feel that way with this one.",1315353600,5,1038,4.870056497175141
4708223,5,B005I4TRWK,"I have tried ALL kinds of work outs and I have never had results like I have had with Ballet Beautiful. I have been taking classes with Mary Helen for 3 years and let me tell you this work out has completely transformed my body. I am petite and curvy ....most other workouts made me bulk up and ballet beautiful has done the opposite. I ONLY do Ballet Beautiful these days and its all that I need.

 After having my first baby I was worried that it would be hard to get my body back but in no time Ballet Beautiful got my body not only back,  but better then before!

 I was so excited when this DVD came out even though sometimes I find it  a little difficult to follow along an exercise DVD. This DVD is sooo easy to follow along with....I absolutely LOVE it! its like doing a private session with Mary Helen wherever and whenever you want! Its so easy to follow but gets those hard to get places like your outer/inner thigh etc. and the highest but imaginable!  It's easy to follow but you will feel the burn.

 I can't say enough how much I love this workout. It's so nice to know that there is something that is out there that actually works where your not wasting your time or money.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD now! you will not believe the compliments you get. I am sure you will love it as much as I do!!!",1315267200,60,1324,4.13671875
4708224,5,B005I4TRWK,I've been doing this work out for 2 months and have seen a transformation more quickly than with anything else I've ever tried! I really recommend it for anyone who wants better posture and to tone and strengthen their entire body.,1314662400,13,231,4.658536585365853
4708225,5,B005I4TRWK,"Just completed the entire workout & absolutely LOVED it!  And while I do love ballet, I'm definitely not a workout fiend.

I've been doing 2 of the BB Blasts streaming from the Ballet Beautiful website, both of which are also fantastic (and can be streamed from my iPhone WHEREVER I GO...YES!).  The 60-minute DVD is a much more in-depth workout than the 15-minute blasts (duh!), but is organized in a way that specific workouts can be chosen in case you don't have time for a full hour session.  Love that.

I popped the DVD in just to check a bit of it out and ended up completing the whole thing!  It went by super quick & I feel great.  Also, you don't need to be a dancer to do it--but seeing Mary Helen's incredible ballerina body might just inspire you to pick up a pair of toe shoes...!",1314403200,15,794,4.324324324324325
4708226,5,B005I4TRWK,"Is it ballet? No. Is it an intense workout? Definitely. For further clarification-this is a ballet workout, not ballet itself, so don't expect actual ballet and give it a bad review. There are exercises that use your body weight instead of tools/props and WOW do I always feel it the next day. There are workout segments for legs, butt, abs and upper body that are killer. I can feel my muscles reshaping themselves. If I had one criticism of this workout I'd say that sometimes she simply goes too fast. It would be nice if I could slow down the in between stretches since I really need them. I tried this one before the rest of the series so I don't know how it compares, but if you like the idea of getting fit while laying down, this is definitely something worth checking out.",1391385600,,781,4.430555555555555
4708227,5,B005I4TRWK,"Love this workout.  She really works the butt, inner and outer thighs as well as the arms and abs.  Highly recommend this, especially if you're travelling.  A great DVD to bring because you don't need weights and a large space to move around.",1382054400,2,242,4.5813953488372094
4708228,5,B005I4TRWK,"she kicks my butt into shape, and she does it pretty much laying down the whole time so that I can feel lazy, and still feel like I'm doing a workout! I'm always sore after this one...I love it!",1380412800,2,194,4.0
4708229,5,B005I4TRWK,"This DVD is hard. I have a new found respect for Ballerinas! Mary Helen looks so calm and relaxed while doing these moves...a typical swan. Me not so much... My legs were shaking, I was sweating, and gritting my teeth through the legs and abs. I made it thorough the DVD and I feel great results because of it. I liked the music and the feel of the video so I wanted to do it again. MHB is encouraging but not annoyingly peppy like some instructors. I combine BB workouts with regular Cardio (elliptical) and it is helping me to reach my weight loss goals. I attribute this DVD to helping me firm up and tone. You can really feel your muscles working and BURNING. If you can't do all the reps at first...don't worry. Build up to it. Just be sure to stretch out really well after each workout. I am a big fan of this routine!",1363046400,2,824,4.2215189873417724
4708230,5,B005I4TRWK,I really like doing this ballet beautiful. I'm not a dancer but I could do all the moves. Very easy but yet very effective. I highly recommend it.,1361836800,,146,4.25
4708231,5,B005I4TRWK,"I have had knee pain and the physical therapist gave me a list of exercises to do to strengthen the muscles around my knees and in my hips, and most of the exercises were exactly as in this dvd (this dvd actually offers even more!!!) The first couple times I did this, I was screaming in pain and could not finish the entire work-out, but after a couple months of doing it 3 times a week about, I could do the whole 60 min. It is worth it, don't give up!! Plus, Mary Helen Bowers is so soft-spoken and beautiful, and the music is very soothing. I love the fact that she does a lot of quick stretches in between each exercise. I have actually gotten more flexible as well as stronger.",1358121600,5,683,4.181818181818182
4708232,4,B005I4TRWK,"I'll admit that I haven't used this DVD as much as I would like to. But that has everything to do with me being lazy and not the DVD itself.
I've watch the entire video and have done a few of the exercises and I can tell you that it will challenge you.  No, you won't be sweating buckets, but you will feel the burn, which is what you want for tone and definiiton.",1356652800,,364,3.918918918918919
4708233,4,B005I4TRWK,"I just started exercising again and I'm particular about how I exercise.  My body is small and my muscles tend to bulk up quickly.  When I was younger, dance classes were a great way for me to lose weight and smooth out bulky muscles.

So I was excited to see MHB's workout video. The video looks beautiful, the music is relaxing and MHB is very engaging.

However this workout I find is extremely advanced.  These exercises are for people already in shape and looking for shaping refinement.  What would have made this workout perfect is if MHB took time to show the modifications for beginners before she started working on each set.  That being said, each exercise targets specific muscles and when done correctly you will feel the work being done.

Please note, some of the leg and abdominal exercises are tough for people with knee problems and/or back problems.  These sections would have benefited greatly with more modification instructions.

Since a new dvd will be released shortly, perhaps there will be more attention to beginners.",1343433600,6,1043,4.875
4708234,5,B005I4TRWK,"I'm kind of a fitness buff. I've been working out every day since 7th grade, and for the last two years I've been a daily Bikram Yoga aficionado. This workout is AMAZING! It's unlike anything I've done before. It's so hard at first that stretching out the muscles after you've finished a 10-minute set of working on them can be so painful I find myself cursing and tearing up. But, after a few weeks I notice my legs getting more toned, and even though it's still not ""easy"" by any means, I can get through it now without cursing! I've done this workout with two girlfriends since I got it in the mail, and both of them turned around and bought the DVD, too.

The only thing I wish I had known before ordering this was that Mary Helen Bowers has two workout DVDs that can be bought as a set for a discounted price. I recommend that anybody thinking about this buy that set.",1341619200,10,873,4.290909090909091
4708235,1,B005I4TRWK,"In the entire sixty minutes of this ""ballet"" workout dvd, there are precisely two ballet moves; however, if you enjoy spending ample time on the floor at home then this video is for you. Don't expect ANY barre work, and you won't be disappointed. For a real ballet workout purchase Element: Ballet Conditioning, and consequently save yourself eight dollars.",1340496000,6,357,5.067796610169491
4708236,5,B005I4TRWK,"I got this in a bundle with the Blast Series--a steal--and I adore this DVD. I love how relaxed the setting is and how do-able the exercises are.

For me, this is sort of the opposite of the Blast Series, which is too rough on my weak wrists. There is one arm exercise that has you put your arms behind you and lift your seat which I skip over because of my wrist injuries, but other than that it seems like overall this is pretty gentle on the joints.

I thought I was in okay shape because of being a Tracy Anderson fan for a couple years now, but I think this DVD is a bit different, and difficult and painful in a really good way! I think some people will complain because of the Title Sequences that pop up between each series of exercises, but I like them because it gives me more time to stretch out my poor muscles. I'm totally a believer.",1340323200,8,847,4.127272727272727
4708237,5,B005I4TRWK,"So, I ordered this product and although there was a bit of a mishap with delivery, the team at BB were calm, polite and professional and dealt with the problem admirably. I've been doing it religiously (alternating with the Blast dvd) for over a week and I must say it's incredible! Mary Helen looks and sounds sweet as sugar but the woman is TOUGH. She works you super hard and just when you think you're due a rest, you have to do another 4 sets of 8. But it's easy to stay motivated whilst looking at her beautiful physique, and the white, serene space in which the video is set has a tremendously calming effect. I actually look forward to doing the video, despite knowing that it's going to make me burn!

I can already see the difference in my abdomen, arms and the backs and outer sides of my thighs. However - this workout works a little too well! I will explain what I mean. I happen to be prone to Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (also known as Runner's Knee), a common condition where the kneecap is pulled off its normal course to the outside of the leg by an imbalance in the muscles. Basically, there are 2 muscles that connect to the kneecap that pull outwards, and one muscle, called the Vastus Medialis Obliquus (or VMO) that pulls it inwards. If the muscles become imbalanced, the kneecap is pulled out of place, causing pain and potentially damage to the cartilage beneath. Ladies with wider hips, such as myself, are more prone to suffer from this as the pull outwards on the kneecap is even greater. As Mary Helen's workouts really work outer thigh muscles, doing the video has caused my condition to flare up again - a testament to how quickly results happen with this programme!

So - I wrote this review to help anyone who also finds that they suffer from knee pain when they do this workout, as I have been helped many times by kind souls sharing their knowledge online. In order to combat the problem I am going to cut back on the outer thigh stuff for a while and do extra inner thigh workouts. Extra work on strengthening the Abs and upper glutes is also supposed to be beneficial. And you can look up exercises for the all-important VMO anywhere online - one of the best is simply to squeeze a cushion between your knees, keeping a finger on the muscle just above your knee on the inside of your leg to check that it is working.

Hope this helps and is not too off-topic!",1340236800,24,2397,4.430839002267573
4708238,5,B005I4TRWK,"Boy, do I love this workout! I usually dread fitness videos and I get so bored with them half way through but this is completely different. The background is simple the music is relaxing and the moves are easy but believe me you will burn for days. I don't even bother taking it out the the dvd player because I use it so often.",1338336000,3,328,4.140625
4708239,5,B005I4TRWK,After reading some of the reviews posted here I was a bit weary that the DVD wouldnt give me the results I was looking for... Whoa was I wrong.  I have been following the DVD for about two weeks now (4-5 times a week).  The results are amazing.  My core and legs feel much much stronger.  The DVD is broken into six segments.  Each other targets a different part of the body.  Each one gives me a get workout.  Its surprisingly how she doesnt sweat at all!  I am sweating really bad.  LOL  over all great dvd!,1338163200,5,509,4.154639175257732
4708240,5,B005I4TRWK,"I took ballet as a child but that was a few decades ago!  I do have a ton of barre DVDs though.  This really isn't barre, though, but more of a mat workout.  I find them complementary though and similar goal at the end.

If you are looking for a fast paced barre DVD, you are probably better off with P57, Booty Barre, etc.  But if you want a workout that lets you really focus, this is a good choice.  I like to alternate the fast paced, with the slower, more concentrated movements.

For me, I continued to feel the inner thigh workout throughout the rest of the day!  That section was very effective for me. I was also surprised how much you can feel that flowing arm work she did. Would be great if you are traveling.  I also liked that she reversed the order of the workout compared to most barre DVDs - bridges at the start, arms and standing work at the end.

Overall, I think it was an excellent workout, I really like MHB and I also loved the classical piano music and the setting.  I found the time went quickly and found myself counting the reps along with her.  I had held off purchasing this DVD as I wasn't sure I would like it, but then the 2-DVD set was discounted so decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did.",1338076800,16,1227,4.105042016806722
4708241,3,B005I4TRWK,"The main thing that threw me off were her body proportions. Yes I know she is a professional dancer but her waist and hips are non existent. It made it very difficult to tell if I was doing a move correctly when her body is perfectly flat in ever aspect. She looks a little thinspiration to me and since I have suffered with anorexia it was very hard to do this video.
Secondly very little is explained and for some exercises especially the thighs I have no idea how she was holding herself in certain crazy positions.
The music was very good and I really like the feature that let you turn the music on and off.
I love the part at the end where we actually did some ballet dancing. She needs to make a video that is only her doing the dance step not all the exercises. With maybe some stretching at the end. All very slow and well explained.
If you are a dancer or have a great body already this is the DVD for you. For anyone else I would take a pass on this. I'm planning on donating the DVD.",1337990400,4,995,4.107692307692307
4708242,5,B005I4TRWK,"I am very happy having ""taken the risk"" ordering this dvd. I made up my own routine and with this DVD I was very happy to see that I was on the right way. M-H proposes very intersting exercices and the routine is quite challenging. She is very elegant and sweet addressing to us. I love her calm and appreciate the music track while she exercices with us.
But I am missing flexibility execices in the all dvd. She is stretching very briefly and by the time I see her position and adapt mine, she has already gone to another exercice... And also her flex ex are always the same.

This dvd will not teach you how to get more flexible.
So you have to comopose your own flex routine (which you can easily find on you tube, on the internet, and in Yoga ex).

I might by the book, it looks fantastic. I think the book is easier to exercices as you can do it at your own pace and do not have to stop the dvd to stretch for as long as you want. But anyway I love to see the ex in real time to analyse the position while moving and be able to do it correctly. Also English is not my mother tong so it allows me to fully understand the ex in movement.

Do not hesitate! Go for it!",1337126400,5,1170,3.9914529914529915
4708243,5,B005I4TRWK,This is my new favorite ballet workout DVD! I previously only used Ballet Conditioning and really felt the results of each workout but was looking for something new to mix things up a bit. I was a little hesitant to buy this DVD because it was a little more expensive but it is well worth the price! Now I wish I would have bought both DVDs! Great workout that really makes you feel the burn!,1332633600,3,392,4.24
4708244,5,B005I4TRWK,"This video is exactly what I was looking for. The exercises are challenging, but there are modifications to accommodate the level that you are at. I have done pilates off and on for about five years. This is similar to pilates but its a little harder. However it feels like it has more impact. Mary is a great teacher and the video is very well produced. The moves are very well explained and you can clearly see everything that she is doing. The set is a lovely ballet studio and the classical music is perfect. Its a 60 minute video, however it's sectioned off so that you can work on whatever body parts you want. I can only do about 30 minutes for now. This routine seems to be working muscles that have never been challenged before. The first time i did each section (except the abs section) i was sore for days! I love this video. I particularly love the way I feel after I finish. It feels like I've worked out for an hour and a half! I have no regrets about this purchase. In fact, I'm thinking about getting her second ballet DVD.",1332633600,5,1039,4.3061224489795915
4708245,5,B005I4TRWK,"For the longest time, I have been struggling to find a workout that works for me. This is the one for me. I used to work out with walking and that would help me in terms of weight but I wouldn't be able to lose excess weight (just maintain it) and I wouldn't be toned.

Ballet Beautiful has given me amazing results and I can't enthuse enough about it. The DVD is easy to follow and Mary Helen Bowers is elegant, soft-spoken, and peaceful.
It's a joy to work out with her!",1329264000,8,472,4.130434782608695
4708246,5,B005I4TRWK,"I'm really not one to review products unless I feel strongly, and I admit, the feeling that spurs me on is usually negative. But not in this case. I am a former soccer player who is years out from her last match and I've gained too much weight. I'd always been interested in ballet, and now that I am trying to lose weight, am especially interested in trying to get myself down to a ballerina's body (with a little more meat on it than a real ballerina, of course). I had done a lot of research on amazon between the numerous ballet-themed DVDs here on Amazon and saw a lot of good reviews for this one in particular, so I took the plunge.

I got it quickly (Thanks, Amazon!) but was intimidated by the 60 minute tagline. It's been a LONG TIME since I'd worked out for longer than 30-45 minutes, and what's more I'm usually so bored by exercise DVDs that I'm checking the clock every couple of minutes, and am battling to make it through the 30 minutes.

Color me surprised when, even though every part of my body was burning, I hadn't checked the clock once and I was already at 45 minutes! It's all body weight strength training. Each move is done in 4 successive 8 count sets; sometimes there's a break after the 4 sets, sometimes you move directly into a new 4-set exercise. Your muscles will definitely start to burn! Even my legs, which are my strongest part of my body thanks to years of soccer, gave into the burn eventually. And once you get there, guess what, you have a couple more sets to go!

The DVD comes with the option of with or without music (i.e. instructor's voice only). The music is really beautiful relaxing classical music that made things go by quickly. Plus, the instructor's voice is very soothing. She just oozes sweetness and it makes you want to go the extra set or two so you don't disappoint her, even though she's obviously not there. She's very soft spoken, and she keeps count well and I just generally found it a pleasing experience.

Another plus is that the instructor pauses for quick mini-stretches after almost every set. I've only done this one time, but I do think this will 1) make sure that even though you're fatiguing your muscles you won't be unbearably sore tomorrow and 2) make sure your muscles don't bulk up, but rather get long and lean like a ballerina (hence, ballet beautiful).

Three things to note. First, there is a brief arms exercise where you do tricep dips that might hurt people with weak wrists like me. You bend your knees, keeping your legs zipped tight together, arms behind you with fingers pointing towards your back. You then lift your body up off the ground and do the tricep dips from that position. I found that really hurt my wrists, so I did the dips without adding the strain of lifting my body up at the same time - I still felt the burn! Second, this isn't a full 60 minutes. The dvd itself runs for about 55 minutes, and there are breaks between the different sections for different parts of the body. But you truly do work out every part of your body, and somehow manage to feel at peace the entire time you're doing it, and even more blissful afterwards! Third, there is no dedicated stretching period - if you want a good long stretch, you'll have to do that on your own.

Overall, this is the best workout DVD I've done, and I have LOTS of them! This will be a great strength training one to throw into the mix.",1329091200,35,3396,4.40829346092504
4708247,5,B005I4TRWK,"I've read most of the reviews on this product and I currently own both the blast series and the classic 60-minute workout.  This workout is the personal training regimen of a well-toned ballerina.  On the back of the DVD we find this appropriate notation: a method ""to help others build a long, toned and powerful-body shape with elegant posture.""

  This is not a ballet class.  She doesn't promise to teach you ballet technique (though terminology is occasionally used) nor does she promise to teach you to dance.  She promises you techniques to help tone, lengthen, and strengthen. I feel this DVD lives up to this claim.

  It is true that while you can turn the music off and on you can not silence Bower's voice. She counts the reps and gives you pointers for positioning in the various stretches/exercises.  (As this is more a workout most work is done on the floor.)  I didn't find her voice intrusive.

 I enjoyed these videos as they gave me something that was pilates-like in an approachable and enjoyable way. I loved that all exercises were easily modified for a beginner and that it was completely low impact.  I enjoyed these videos and feel that if you're looking for a low-impact workout you're in for a treat.  If you're looking for dance technique, training, classes, etc you should look elsewhere.",1329004800,9,1317,4.761061946902655
4708248,5,B005I4TRWK,"I love the Ballet Beautiful DVD's and streaming videos that you can buy from Amazon and Ms. Bower's website.  This DVD I do think is easier than her Blast series, but still the exercises will work your body without over stressing the joints.  I also enjoy the music options and the music track she does play is a thousand times better than the elevator crap most ballet workouts use.  Furthermore, I am tired of doing ballet-inspired workouts from instructors who have very little if any ballet experience. If you are trained dancer watching ballet workouts in which the instructors have little to no ballet form and have a girl version body of the Incredible Hulk is annoying.  Ballet is about form not about throwing your body around like a drunk aerobics instructor. That said you do not have to ballet experience to do this DVD, but having an instructor who knows ballet form is a MUST in a ballet type workout",1328313600,10,914,4.658385093167702

Focus is all on the work out and nothing else. Mary is very easy to follow and is exactly what you would expect her to be.  I find myself amazed that an hour has passed every time I work out.  This is very basic floor exercises but they work, They are just like the ones I use to do in class as a young dancer.  No equipment and not a lot of floor space needed.  Which is a big bonus for me.  I wish when I originally purchased it I had gotten the blast as well.  I definitely recommend getting both at the same time.

4708252,5,B005I4TRWK,"I was so impressed with this workout! The problem I have had with nearly all workout videos are either the movements are too complex for me to follow along with, or they just don't provide me with much of a workout. Ballet Beautiful is exactly what I needed! Maybe this video is not for experienced dancers--but being a bikram yoga practioner for several years (I consider myself pretty fit), I felt like this workout targeted so many muscles I had never worked on before. I plan on doing it daily now in addition to my yoga practice. In fact, I will look into taking one of Mary Helen's classes next time I am in New York!",1325548800,11,623,4.379310344827586
4708253,5,B005I4TRWK,"I love the Ballet Beautiful Classic 60 minute workout!  As someone who is always on the lookout for a great workout DVD, I've tried them all and Ballet Beautiful is by far the most effective.  There aren't any crazy routines to learn before you begin (as is the case with so many fitness DVDs) and you're guaranteed to get a great gimmick-free workout. I have NO experience in ballet whatsoever, so no prior experience is necessary.  The exercises require very little space and are easy to do in a hotel room, living room or college dorm (all spoken from personal experience).  Not only is the workout effective in terms of toning/sculpting, but the exercises really help to improve posture.  I've been doing the DVD 3-4 times a week since September, and my posture is way better than it's ever been.  People (my mother included) have commented.  Also, the butt and legs exercises are particularly effective in getting at the glutes, which I've often found to be a hard-to-target area.  The butt and legs sequences might seem really tough to get through at first, but if you stick with it for a few days, I promise you'll be able to finish them. Mary Helen explains proper technique as you go, so that you can make the most out of your workout.  There are enough reps to allow you to perfect your positioning, etc. and really feel it.  The light-filled studio is stunning and cheery and makes a huge difference.  You almost forget you're workout out...that is, until the next day.  Your legs will feel like jelly.",1325548800,12,1513,4.667924528301887
4708254,5,B005I4TRWK,"This is a great workout!  I have been doing the full 60 minute DVD 2-3 times per week for about 3 months and am getting some serious results.  I was already in pretty good shape (I was a dancer for many years and have always exercised religiously), but was just looking for something to kick things up a notch.  The other workouts I have been doing for years were of the typical cardio and weights variety and while those have been great for keeping the weight down, I found that I needed something to shape my body a bit more.  Well...this is working!!  I have those little ""dents"" on the sides of my butt now, my abs look amazing, my thighs and hamstrings are rock hard, and my arms and back have a lot more definition than before.  Definitely am getting the best results I have ever had from a workout DVD and trust me...I have done dozens and dozens of them (Cathe Friedrich, Tae Bo, Jari Love, etc.).  I highly recommend this workout - Mary Helen is very elegant and soft-spoken, so it is a very calming, soothing 60 minutes.  All that said, the woman will whip you into shape.  Try it...you won't be disappointed.  One thing to mention is if you are looking for actual ballet instruction, this is not the video for you. Rather, this video is geared towards conditioning, toning, and elongating the muscles to give you the body of a dancer.  Aside from the very brief standing portion where she does some exercises like pli&eacute;s and relev&eacute;s, there is little to no *actual* ballet in this workout.  I knew what I was buying and therefore, was not disappointed by this fact.  Love it!!",1325203200,24,1599,4.510416666666667
4708255,5,B005I4TRWK,"I am very pleased with this DVD, I began to sweat only 10 minutes into it.  The exercises are simple, but tough, and you will feel the burn.  It's not a balet class, but very effective conditioning for long and lean ballet-type bodies.  There is no music, so I pop in a classical CD while I work out.  Watch it once or twice before you try it then you will keep up with Mary easily.",1324944000,,382,4.053333333333334
4708256,5,B005I4TRWK,"Ballet Beautiful is by far my favorite workout to do and I absolutely cannot rave enough about the results I am getting and how enjoyable it is to do. Before learning about Mary Helen's program I was a total Tracy Anderson devotee. I didn't ever think I could find another workout that I would enjoy as much as Tracy's programs. Ballet Beautiful is so much fun and I always look forward to doing it which is not something I could always say for TA. I love everything about this dvd. The set is clean and the camera angles show you what Mary Helen is doing. She is encouraging without being a cheerleader, something I can't stomach. Her counting keeps me on track and I love the breaks that are taken for stretching. I own both of her dvd's and her streaming videos. While I love the blast dvd, I enjoy this 60 minute classic workout the most. The video is chaptered so it's easy to mix and match what you feel like doing if you don't have time for the whole 60 minutes. My customer service experience with her has been amazing and I look forward to more from Ballet Beautiful!

*May 2012: This is still my favorite workout to do, I reach for it all the time and I am loving my results. I have also purchased her newest streaming videos, the cardio series and abs and couldn't be more pleased. This workout is amazing, and their customer service is still top notch! I can't wait for the book to come out next month!",1319760000,38,1414,4.335849056603774
4708257,5,B005I4TRWK,"I love Ballet Beautiful! I actually use one of the videos from the Blast dvd as a warm-up to this dvd and it works out great! I've been doing the Ballet Beautiful videos every day for nearly two months now and I've seen such an improvement in not only my weight (I'm now 120 down from 130, which is great!) but also my posture and overall awareness of my body. I'm back to the same flexibility I had when I was in high school and I can't see myself stopping this method for a long time! I bought this video along with the Blast dvd primarily because they didn't require extra equipment to do the work outs (aside from a yoga mat). One of the features of the video that I like is that the segments are all broken up (Bridge Series, Abs, Inner Thigh, Outer Thigh, Arms, Standing Cardio) and you have the option to ""play all"" as a 60-minute video or if you're tight on time, only do a few segments. I actually like doing the bridge, abs, inner and outer thigh for when I'm short on time but still want to fit in something for the day. I recently got my sister hooked on Ballet Beautiful and she loves that it's low impact and you can pretty much take it anywhere to do it! Love it!",1319673600,10,1178,4.148471615720524
4708258,5,B005I4TRWK,"I got my DVD quickly and couldn't wait to open it up and get started! Here I am, about a month later and I'm very happy with this workout. I can't say enough good things about this, it's really worked for me.

First, the DVD is set up really well, with each chapter covering a different area of the body. This lets me work out regardless of whether I have 15 mins, or 60 mins. So no excuses ladies!

Second, there is no overhyped music nor distracting background exercisers, just Mary guiding you along. I personally like the simple way this was shot and edited, it feels like Mary is personally training just me. The clean white studio and simple piano music inbetween chapters creates a nice relaxed mood. Why is this important? Well, when I try to work out, I hate that nagging feeling that usually comes with it like, ""ugh, I have to seriously move my butt b/c I ate too much yesterday...."" etc. But this DVD doesn't feel like a typical gym workout, it feels like a fabulous studio training session with a nice, friendly and encouraging teacher.

Third thing, results!
My body type doesn't happen to lose weight or get fit easily, so I got this thinking maybe it would just be a fun add on to my gym routine, especially for rainy days when I can't be bothered to get to the gym. I read the other reviews and it seems liked everyone else was getting amazing results, so I was curious. Let me assure you, this DVD will get you in shape! After using it once or twice, you will certainly feel fatigue in your muscles, in a good way! I also find the workout to get easier with time, I can get through more repetitions, with less breaks etc, so I'm definitely getting stronger. There are modifications throughout, so I recommend this for people at all levels of fitness.

Overall, I think this is a GREAT workout, it's actually effective without making you sweaty and exhausted (I actually feel awake and energized when I'm done), and it's actually fun and makes you feel like an elegant ballerina.

I haven't yet gotten the Blast Series DVD, I wanted to try this one first. But now I think I'll get that one in another month or so. I hope this helps readers and if you end up buying it, hope you love it as much as I do!",1319328000,24,2219,4.36319612590799

I absolutely love love love the program.... its simple yet so effective. It has changed the shape of my legs in a big big way...no more jiggly inner thighs for me. My legs feel and look longer and leaner.
 I love doing the workout because its focused and its fun and moreover I can see results. The program is divided into different series and parts so its easy to use as you don't have to fast forward. You can actually choose the part you want to workout and get started....Thanks Mary Helen Bowers for making this awesome video and helping people like me feel more beautiful!!!!",1319068800,14,719,4.530769230769231
4708260,4,B005I4TRWK,"I was so excited to finally get my DVDs and I was not disappointed!

I've been an athlete my entire life, but that has all revolved around high impact workouts and lots of cardio. I loved this low impact workout and the burn it created in the areas i've wanted to work out the most!

I can understand why people say the stretching feels too short, but from my own athletic history i know that doing intense stretching during a workout is not ideal and could even lead to injuries. A quick stretch to get the deep burn out is all that is needed!

I also agree that I was hoping for more ballet moves, but this is a workout DVD not a ballet instructional video. I'm excited to try the blast series!",1319068800,8,696,4.2180451127819545

Ballet Beautiful is the only thing that has met all my needs while being thoroughly enjoyable. Mary Helen's workouts keep my toned, lean, long and graceful. I did Ballet Beautiful throughout my last pregnancy and was shocked at how quickly my body bounced back. I can't recommend this method enough. Her DVD's are wonderful. I travel with them at all times. They are comprehensive, easy to follow and make you feel wonderful. You need no ballet training to enjoy Ballet Beautiful but as a former dancer, I enjoy the method as well. This workout is for everyone!",1318982400,15,736,4.6692307692307695
4708262,1,B005I4TRWK,"Boy,
I have to agree with Lauren. This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review.
I have been waiting for months for this dvd to be released. I was so excited to find it in the mailbox. And then, I watched it first on my computer to get familiar with the moves before exercising with it. I was so disappointed. To watch Mary Helen Bowers exercise, I guess, can be inspirational, but I was expecting something more directed at movements and stretches for ballet.

First, there is only music during the section titles. There is no music during the exercises. You get to listen to her count to 8 numerous times. The exercises are nothing new, and you probably have each of them on some other workout video in your collection. The only section with any ballet to it is the standing section with some demi plies and releves.

And, after each exercise, she does a quick stretch of that muscle group. I do mean quick - I have always been told to stretch for 20 seconds and up to a full minute to truly let a muscle relax and stretch. Her stretches last a couple of seconds.

Along with this dvd, I bought Ballet Boot Camp 2 which is much more delightful - great flow, classical background music  but it works here) - a much better value.",1318550400,11,1246,4.334763948497854
4708263,1,B005I4TRWK,"I do not usually write reviews but felt so strongly about this DVD that I had to. My purchase was swayed by the 4 and 5 star reviewers but now, having bought and done the workout, I agree with the more critical comments. If you are used to P57 or more rigorous Pilates workouts, you will be disappointed. The routines lack variety, and the instructions lack cues to deepen the exercises. As another reviewer mentioned, the stretching after exercises is super fast and therefore barely helpful. Those with ballet experience and/or familiarity with barre related workouts will be left wanting. Sorry MHB, you are super sweet and beautiful, but your DVD is not what I expected.",1318550400,12,674,4.818965517241379
4708264,5,B005I4TRWK,"I found out about this DVD via my Google search for ""How to get a dancer's body."" Honestly, I wasn't expecting to find anything all that intriguing or anything along the lines of what I was looking for. Much to my surprise, I stumbled upon an article about Mary Helen Bowers training Natalie Portman for Black Swan.... The next thing I knew, I was on Amazon ordering this DVD.

I tried it out, and boy it BURNS! I did not think I would feel completely worked out as much as I did! My favorite workouts are the leg workout, and the bridge workout. I really felt my target areas, as well as my core, working.

I love the fact that there is no music. I just put some classical music on iTunes and am ready to go! I like that I can personalize and choose the music I work out to, rather than being stuck with listening to something cheesy or something that's not my taste.

One thing I will say is that, at first, I felt a little ridiculous doing the second part of the arm exercises. However, DO IT. You will definitely feel the burn in your arms after a bit!

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this workout. I definitely am going to keep, and stick to Mary Helen's DVD. The workouts are effective, and over time, I have no doubt whatsoever that I (along with anyone else who incorporates this DVD into their routine) will see results! I can't wait for her cardio DVD to come out :).

P.S. Try getting some ballet shoes to workout in. Personally, it really helps me feel ""like a dancer"" and makes me more inspired to workout harder! I hope this review is of some help to you!",1318464000,44,1566,4.277027027027027
4708265,5,B005I4TRWK,"I love this workout. The moves are by no means revolutionary; anyone with any dance/pilates/dance workout (a traditional ballet class this isn't) experience will be very familiar with them. But they're classics because they're effective as hell. Mary Helen Bowers is pleasant, non-irritating, doesn't say cutesy/ridiculous things (she is not overly perky, saints be praised), and has a physique that never fails to inspire.

Also, there's NO MUSIC! HOORAY! Even the best soundtrack gets old after a few workouts, and I love that they didn't clutter this with some stupid music.

There isn't an excess of instruction, so do what you can and your form will get better in time.

I would have loved to see a bit more classic ballet instruction in it, but we'll just hope she puts out more videos. Lovely.",1317945600,20,800,4.955223880597015
8474217,5,B005I4TRWK,"I stumbled upon some of ballet beautiful's exercises on youtube and I have to say they are some of the best ive ever done. I do one or two a day combined with stretching/kundalini or hatha yoga/pilates/chi gong and/or some dance-based cardio depending on how I'm feeling that day. They are hard but get easier. I prefer quick callanetics, lotte berk method or original lotte berk excercises for abs however as I think they work the entire abdominal wall better and are a little more engaging for me. You may also want to do some other excercises for quads as they're very light in this dept. but some lunges, barre work, bicycling or skating will make up for this. I do recommend stretching (a lot!) at first, but your flexibility will improve as your strength and stamina does. Their efficiency trumps any notion of being boring for me, as they remain challenging and produce visible results and ones you can feel. I recommend combining them with more standing excercises to keep all of the body's muscle groups integrated (if you like barre workouts, I like Fluidity for this or any standing ballet excercises), but if you stick with it you will probably dump a lot of the other things you've been doing because these are really worth doing forever. You can really base anything else you do around these. If you want to look sleek, long and toned, look no further.",1468195200,2,1366,4.672199170124482

8474219,5,B005I4TRWK,I bought it from iTunes. Totally worth it. I start to feel the muscle in the back of my thigh after 3 workouts. My legs are difinitely much better. Good for beginners.,1449619200,,167,4.25
8474220,5,B005I4TRWK,"At the time of writing this review, I've been using this DVD consistently for the past 6 months.

For reference, previous to starting this DVD, I'd been using one of Tracey Anderson's DVD's for 3-4 months prior to switching to this one. Before starting Tracey Anderson, I was quite unfit and had never done any actual strength training exercises before. Before trying any of these DVDs, I'd just taken up running again for 4 months prior, but stopped after I started having knee problems.

Personally, I felt that this DVD kept me feeling adequately challenged for about 4 months, using it about 5-6 days a week. When I felt that it was becoming easier, I started doing more reps of the exercises, which seemed to work for me. Generally after doing a complete 60 minute set, my legs always come away burning.

I love how minimalist all of her workouts are. On this DVD it's just your body weight, a mat, and no other equipment. As others have said, it's definitely not for those who are looking to actually do ballet workouts, or who are familiar with ballet and are expecting something more along those lines.

Form took a little to get right for me, and I found that I had to be willing to have the patience to work on it. At first when I did her exercises, they felt 'easy', but as I watched and tried to replicate her movements precisely, I soon found that it was because I wasn't doing them totally right to begin with. I find that if you really take the time to get to a point where you build the muscle to hold the moves correctly and do them as she does, these exercises are wonderfully challenging and will remain that way for a very, very long time. I still find them challenging, the only thing that has changed for me are the reps.

In terms of physical changes, here's a bit about me. I have always had large thighs, hips and calves, with a much smaller frame up top. I will note that for a long time when I started, I did not do these exercises in conjunction with a very balanced eating habit. I just wasn't ready yet, and my goal was not just physical well-being, but largely mental well-being. That being said, using this DVD 5-6 days a week over the course of 4 months, without changing my eating habits (and I am the kind to snack on chocolate, ice cream and chips) while I didn't drop any weight on the scale, I have most definitely seen a huge change in the muscular structure of my legs. I feel they have become much more 'streamlined' as she talks about in the DVD and I've dropped down a pant size. I can honestly say I feel so much happier with how my legs look now. Because of that change, it's only compelled me to pay more attention to being more balanced with my eating habits. I've never been happy with my legs, they've always been my biggest insecurity, but I really feel like I've gotten to that point with Ballet Beautiful where I actually feel comfortable with them now.

After 6 months of using the Classic 60 minute workout (In conjunction with her Blast Series for the last 2 months) I have recently, in the past 2 weeks, switched to her online custom workouts, and so far I am very pleased with the results I'm getting from that as well. It's very nice to have the variations to the exercises and some of the exercises give me more opportunity to work on my coordination and balance, which I really like.

As other reviewers have commented, I find Mary Helen Bowers to be a pleasure to listen to and work out with and I have never gotten sick of her. Over time, the more I have learned about her as a person and her outlook on eating and exercise, I've only come to have more respect and appreciation for her as a person.
As a person who has struggled quite a lot with body confidence issues and anxieties around eating and exercising, I found that Mary Helen's gentle and centered approach to diet and exercise really helps me feel balanced in my own attitudes. (I've read interviews online that she has done and read her book). While she challenges you, she never tries to compel you or make you feel like you need to push yourself beyond your own limits or toward an ideal standard. I really feel like she gives you the tools, shows you how to use them properly, then lets you decide how you want to make it work for you. I love her philosophy that any amount of exercise each day, even if it's just 10-15 minutes, is still a meaningful achievement and goal. She really helped me get unstuck from that 'all or nothing' mindset.

I can't give this DVD a high enough rating, I absolutely love it, it's definitely a staple. I'd recommend it to anyone. Even though I'm using her custom workouts online now, I still feel like this is an invaluable addition to have in my library for if I have to travel somewhere without an internet connection, or if my own internet connection is down and I can't stream.",1443657600,6,4842,4.396205357142857

Mary Helen Bowers really pushes to get you toned but as previously stated, isn't annoying and what I love is you can memorize this pretty quick so now I can just put on one of my shows and do the routine as well.
