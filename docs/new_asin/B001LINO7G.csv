Kudos to the Deol brothers for becoming part of this project.  Even though did not do well commercially, due to whatever reason, this in my opinion, is one the best roles the Deol brothers have signed into.  Their performances specially that of Bobby Deol stands out.  It won't disappoint.",1464480000,,358,4.916666666666667
8318203,4,B001LINO7G,"Shaheed is a very realistic depiction of our India in the pre-Independence era, as our heroes fought valiantly and stuck strong to their cause of freedom. The Deols, being real Punjabis, fit their characters of Bhagat Singh (Bobby Deol) and Chandrashekhar Azad (Sunny Deol) perfectly.  This movie is dramatic, and yet, so invigorating. A movie like this really boils your blood so hard that you just want to go out there and take action with big guns and go after those zamindaars. Stand up for the country's honor and dignity. Action and performances are excellent. You will like this movie a lot!! Cheers!",1300838400,,607,4.893203883495145
