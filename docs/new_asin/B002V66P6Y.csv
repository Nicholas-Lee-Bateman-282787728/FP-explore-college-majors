An unhappy couple (due he is unable to satisfy the wishes of his wife to be mother) and her immature and non reflexive behavior afterwards. A solitaire woman in her late twenties who have two kids (being unable to give them an adequate care due her precarious financial ingresses. A middle aged man who is well aware he must be married and finally an old woman who mediates about the sense of the life, will be involved in a painful web of unpleasant incidents (that include two car accidents).
