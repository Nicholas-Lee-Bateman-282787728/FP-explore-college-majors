3048377,2,B0010AN7LS,"I don't like to pan products which I find of poor quality, I usually just keep my trap shut.  However, as I watched this movie as part of the Amazon Vine Program, I felt it behooved me to offer an honest review of it.

This movie is really not worth the time or money you would spend to watch it.  The acting is passable if uninspired, with the protagonist being the best we get.  He does a fair job of portraying a disturbed artist, but the background of the character is so fragile and thin and arrives so late that it makes the story a failure.  The relationships are terribly developed, and would make the people in them suicidal should they exist in real life.  The total apathy and disregard the supporting cast feels towards the protagonist for most of the film is depressing.  I actually liked the character of the best friend, who displays some compassion as he describes why he is the main character's friend.

The story purports to have a twist at the end, which is very poorly executed and not at all surprising, and would have been so either way it could have gone.  There is nothing in the cinematography that is remarkable, and the semi-focus on jazz music is incomplete when it could have been used as a real focus of the plot.  The soundtrack is uninspired and the overall feeling I had after viewing the movie was disappointment.  While the story had some real potential, it was just poorly executed and fell short of what I could recommend to others.  Classid Hitchcock movies are far superior in all ways.",1204502400,9,1525,4.505454545454546
3048378,4,B0010AN7LS,"I really enjoyed this psychological thriller. It was just a tad slow in a couple of places but the acting, the beautifully filmed Portland, Oregon cityscape (from where I am as I write this) and the surprise ending made it worth riding out.

Joel David Moore does a fabulous job of capturing the odd mannerisms and overall loser personality of the character, and the ever-cute Amber Tamblyn (why in the world did Joan of Arcadia go off the air?) is a wonderful actress who always brings naturalness to her portrayals.

I can't say that I agree with the blurbs on the DVD jacket - ""Hitchcock-tail"" and ""startling imagery"" - but the unraveling of Moore's character is well done.

I look forward to more from this crew.",1204502400,,716,4.666666666666667
3048379,2,B0010AN7LS,"Except that the spiral is into a bottomless pit.
There is nothing exceptionally scarey about this film, even in the commentary the co-director/Writer/Producers, admit to leaving in a sound sting where there is not meant to be anything scarey at all. Even with the frenetic ability that some indie producers have to raise money, the fact that some of these people were associated with HATCHET, a film with some fairly good FX, if scant story line, is a little bit of a worry; HATCHET showed that a good indie film can benefit from some name actors and a DP who knows the business. SPIRAL has none of that. A rather troubled young man makes friends with a young girl, and his ability to sketch and paint brings them together. There are two attempts at the ""Wow I never saw that coming"" twists at the end, but these do not work. Through the entire
film, and the commentary will tell you this, the use of extras to make the film look ""larger"" than the budget would indicate falls flat, because the scenes with the extras are NEVER USED !!!
It may be true that ""YOU CAN'T PAINT OVER YOUR PAST"", but it is very true that some need to brush up on their film making.

3048380,3,B0010AN7LS,"I avoid recent films that tout 'Hitchcock-like', or any version of that statement. I believe that the only one who can make those kind of movies of late is either the Coen Brothers or Brian DePalma. And boy I wish Brian DePalma would have got his hands on this one.
The story is actually quite good but mixed up in the telling. You can read the synopsis and other reviews for that. The acting by the two main characters was excellent, the other characters not so good or believeable.
What I wish they would have done differently was let you into the main character's mind a little. Flashbacks would have worked here very well. Hey... even Hitchcock gave clues throughout his movies. He drew you in and that's what worked.
This movie didn't draw you in. It was flat. But I kept watching just to find out where it was going.
I have to say... all is finally disclosed at the end. And it is a true suprise ending which I will tip my hat at.

3048391,1,B0010AN7LS,"I've given my rating careful consideration but after the disappointing experience I had attempting to watch this, I wanted to offer my opinion as a warning. Something I admittedly have difficulty with in movies is characters depicted as friends who I can't even imagining wanting to be NEAR each other. Yeah, codependent friendships do exist but who in the heck wants to watch someone put up with this miserable nonsense from his clearly disturbed friend? No amount of superiority complex this might feed would seem to warrant this. Has anyone involved in this ever actually been in, let alone worked in a telemarketing office atmosphere? Obviously, shooting in one doesn't guarantee soaking up a realistic vibe. Every character seems to exist to ""propel"" the non-plot forward. We're talking extremely unbelievable behavior and naivete. It's just a mess. Just because it's ""low-fi"" and ""indie"" it doesn't change an unpleasant mess from being an unpleasant mess. It's clumsy and it tries to be edgy and arty. Yuck. I enjoy a well-told grim film dealing with a character's tenuous grasp of sanity and reality. However, this time, I had to shut it off and go wash the ""yuck"" from my brain. No thanks. I mean- a character who values his sketches walks around in the pouring rain with his sketchbook in hand? WHAT?",1387238400,,1309,4.954545454545454

3048397,5,B0010AN7LS,"Joel David Moore and Adam Green have created a unique, startling, and humane psychological thriller about a distrubed yet talented young man and the woman that could possibly be his salvation. The film offers a great jazz score, decent visuals and pitch perfect casting. More specificially, while this is Moore's show, the scene stealer is Zachary Levi who plays Moore's boss and friend. Those who only know him from TV's Chuck will be shocked to see him play an a jerk, but Levi imbibes the character with glimmers of sympathy to make you still care about him.

The film ends on what appears to be a conventional twist, one had it stayed the course would of knocked the film down to a three star affair. But then, just when you are getting comfortable, the second falls like an anvil, kicking you in the gut and underlying the true horror of the situation. The film ends in shock, horror, and just plain sadness.

3048398,4,B0010AN7LS,"The reviewer who said this movie has an identity conflict was correct. But this should not stop you from watching it. The film starts very slowly as a dark character study. It has very awkward scenes involving Nathan and the only two people with whom he interacts (Amber and his boss). I kept constantly questioning why they would even hang out with him.

Once Nathan started talking in complete sentences, the film became more interesting. It really explores the relationship between two very opposite individuals.

The ending, however, made it a thriller. The action picks up. There is no blood or gore in this movie, however.

So - I would watch this if you can survive a slow to develop film. It does satisfy in the end.

Finally, The jazz score was great. And the moral of the story: Acts like a psycho, talks like a psycho = psycho.",1335571200,,838,4.604026845637584
3048399,3,B0010AN7LS,"Spiral (2007) is a well-written and executed film that at times plays like a quirky romantic comedy gone really wrong.  Joel David Moore (Avatar) co-wrote, co-directed, co-produced, and stars in the film as Mason, a shy loner who is befriended by young woman, who is taken by his talents as an artist.  Adam Green (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen/dp/B0034G4OVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatchet-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000WC389G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatchet (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>) serves as co-director for this rather engaging, though somewhat predictable tale.

Working at an insurance company as a telemarketer, Mason is a guy who seems to have some psychological issues.  His boss Berkley (Zachary Levi from TV's Chuck) is also his friend, and is rather free with giving Mason personal advice.  Mason is an artist, and his sketches draw the attention of Amber (Amber Tamblyn), a new employee at the company.  Vivacious, and perhaps a little whimsical, Amber takes the initiative and begins to draw Mason out of his shell, discovering that he is also a jazz aficionado.  The two form an odd, but sweet kind of relationship, as Amber eventually convinces Mason to paint her portrait.  Pleased with the results, Amber poses for additional paintings.  Just when they have become close, a dagger of suspicion changes everything.

Mason seems to become more human as the story progresses, and it is possible at times to envision he and Amber as players in some flighty romantic comedy, almost up until the final dark turn.  With strong performances by Joel David Moore and Amber Tamblyn (Joan of Arcadia), Spiral is a film best viewed with a minimum of foreknowledge.  It's mostly an interesting and compelling watch, albeit one with a number of really large plot holes.  The DVD features a lively group commentary headed by Moore and Green, which is entertaining as well as informative.",1325635200,,2028,5.787878787878788

3048403,3,B0010AN7LS,"This is a very slow-paced movie. I am all for movies that allow a story to grow, especially a mystery and thriller but there were some scenes in this film that should've been cut and weren't needed.

I had mixed feelings about the base of the film but the ending made up for it. I found the actors did a wonderful job and the mystery was on point but the movie moved at a snail's pace to the point where you might not even make it to the end and the end is the best part.

I won't go into what this film is all about. It's a film where even the smallest of disclosures could be a spoiler. This is a film where you're gonna have to be patient, analyze and watch until the end. If you miss the ending, you might as well not even watch any of it. The ending ties it altogether.

The movie's strong points were the chemistry between the main characters, the emotions and how characters react to each other. The film feels very realistic and with a faster pace, this could give Psycho a run for its money.

If not so slow and if had more conflict, I probably would've given it 4 or 5 stars. You'll have to be extremely patient with this but I recommend it if you like psychological thrillers.",1309996800,,1187,4.147826086956521

Just as she begins to break down his barriers and he begins to show signs of life while painting her portraits, Amber discovers that she may not be the first person to see the tip of his paintbrush, though she may be the last... Joel David Moore is perfectly fitting as Mason, delivering the cold and empty performance that the role required. The steady build allows Amber and the viewer ample time to get in to Mason's head, but just as he starts to open up to become a likable character, a sudden reveal immediately ramps up the terror and turns the tables on our social misfit. Moore's writing and direction under Adam Green's supervision demonstrate a great deal of potential here, and are aided by crisp visuals and expert framing. Mason's declining mental state is alluded to on screen in a series of visual metaphors seen in the approaching storm, electrical outages, and increasingly shaky camera work. While many of the plot twists are easily predictable, SPIRAL produces a solid psychological thriller based on strong performances and a sound structure.

3048408,5,B0010AN7LS,"Spiral was nothing short of genius.

The acting was amazing especially by David Joel Moore who also starred in Hatchet another of Adam Green's films.

Some might think the movie a bit slow but I see it as  building a foundation and great Character development something you don't see enough in a lot of films  lately. Moore plays Mason, an introverted and emotionally disturbed man who goes to work at a drab job and  also leisurely loves to paint. He loves to paint beautiful women. Amber Tamblyn plays the new girl ""Amber""at Mason's place of employment and she for some reason is drawn to him' after a few lunch time meetings Mason starts painting Amber when she visits his Apartment "" One that holds many secrets"" .

They strike up an friendship that leads to somewhat of a love affair.

This is when it all starts to unravel..

What ensues next is intense and I couldn't stop watching. The story is amazing and the ambiguous nature of some of the content is also genius because it allows us to come to our own conclusion. There is a line in the film that I can't get out of my head, It's when Mason is talking to his brother Berkley ""Zackary Levi"", the line is "" How do you know if Their real or not?""

3048415,3,B0010AN7LS,"Spiral is a passable thriller that has its bits of cleverness, but overall is merely average.  The principal character (played by Joel David Moore) is a telemarketer by day and artist by night who, as the movie opens, has apparently committed a murder.  I say apparently because we never see a body and it's clear from the get-go that this guy is not all there.  Also implied is that the victim was a waitress he seemed obsessed by.

Into his life comes a co-worker (Amber Tamblyn) who takes an instant shine to him and becomes the model for his latest set of paintings.  The two become closer as he repeats his previous cycle of paintings featuring the waitress; will it end as badly?

While competently directed, acted and written, the movie also suffers from flaws.  The big one is plausibility:  I could never buy Tamblyn's character pursuing this guy:  he is just too antisocial, and she is too attractive (in personality and appearance) to have him as the only option in her life.

Then there is the big plot twist at the end, which I (and probably many others) could see coming a mile away, followed by a second twist that, while clever, still stretches the credibility problems.  The good and bad in Spiral balance out, making this a three star flick:  not good enough to merit watching if something else is available, not bad enough to be a waste of time if you did see it.",1209254400,,1382,4.550607287449393

3048417,5,B0010AN7LS,"I'm used to liking certain films that seem to engender only a lukewarm response from a majority of viewers, but I have to draw a line in the sand when it comes to Spiral.  This is a brilliant film on so many levels, an outr&eacute; work of cinematic art that marches to the sound of its own uniquely discordant drum, pushing and pulling the viewer to an ending that does not disappoint in the slightest.  I will grant the fact that the film moves at a leisurely pace that some might find boring, and people who have lived their whole lives immersed in the ""in crowd"" might look down their noses at the protagonist without even making an effort to sympathize with (let alone relate to) him, but this is a very human story that cuts far too wide a swath across the emotional landscape to be pigeonholed into any one constraining genre.  Maybe some viewers were expecting more of an actual horror film along the lines of Hatchet, since Spiral reunites co-writer Joel David Moore and co-director Adam Green from that earlier project, but these guys are obviously true filmmakers devoted to their craft and determined to spread their wings rather than settle for churning out one slasher after another.

Spiral's story revolves around Mason (Joel David Moore), a troubled fellow who is so far out of the mainstream he makes me look normal and popular.  Our first encounter with him shows just how vulnerable and possibly deranged he is, and this image is further reinforced by the mysterious dark secret lurking behind one of the doors in his apartment and the frightening visions that haunt his dreams.  At work, he seems incapable of actually associating with anyone other than his boss and long-time friend Berkeley (Zachary Levi) - until, that is, a new employee named Amber (Amber Tamlyn) decides to join him on his lonely bench during lunch and strikes up a friendship with him.  Amber's a hard nut to crack; spontaneous and outwardly emotional (not to mention hot), she's the very opposite of Mason, yet she obviously likes him despite all of his obvious problems.  Their awkward friendship slowly grows into a more meaningful relationship when she begins posing for Mason, who is quite the artist.  In fact, art seems to be the one safe refuge that Mason can cling to in life - actually, safe may not be the right word, for his sketches and paintings reveal troubling portents of obsession.

If you want every little thing explained to you in detail at the end, Spiral may not be your movie, but the whole story makes perfect sense.  This is a film that could have ended very badly, but all of the painstaking detail and effort that went into the movie up until that point is more than aptly rewarded with a conclusion that I consider well-nigh perfect (and not necessarily predictable).  I was particularly impressed by the symbolism built into the presentation, as it quietly magnifies the significance of everything that happens, especially in the closing moments.  The film's jazz soundtrack helps maintain a surreal atmosphere that plays up the whole reality vs. fantasy angle that drives the story along (although it also reminded me just how much I detest light jazz).  And all of that stuff about the story progressing so slowly in the beginning - it's called pacing, and I think it's spot-on in this case.  The more you're able to wallow in the dysfunctional lives of these characters, the more effective the shock ending becomes.

In case you can't tell, I love this movie.  I think it's a work of multi-faceted brilliance.",1208390400,,3536,4.770491803278689
3048418,2,B0010AN7LS,"SPIRAL is very much a vanity piece.  Two of its executive producers hold starring roles, and it is co-written and co-directed by its leading man, Joel David Moore (who was so much better in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Art-School-Confidential/dp/B000H6SXSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Art School Confidential</a>).  There's one thing that can be said of vanity: it does provide unity of vision.

Unfortunately, it does not also provide clarity, at least in any great amount.  SPIRAL tells the tale of a socially stunted painter who is so scrunched up within himself and his past, that he shows to the world very little other than a neurotic tendency to clap his teeth together.  Mason is our painter, a chin-less, spine-less, quivering Jell-O mold of a man who is at his ablest when in front of the canvas.  Mason does such a terrific job of portraying this mental defective, that you will probably find him as grating as a hangnail from frame number one.

Irony of ironies, the two people who are most central to his life are equally mind-numbing.  His boss and best friend is the inexplicable Berkeley (Zachary Levi), a lascivious man-whore who hires employees based on cup size.  The girl Mason befriends at work, Amber (Amber Tamblyn), is the human equivalent of an over-carbonated Sprite.  Neither one of these people have any new or interesting things to say.  Both of them appear to have purchased their personalities wholesale.  And they contrast so grotesquely with Mason's facial-tic of a life, that it is only by a supreme amount of mental effort that one can imagine why they endure his presence at all, let alone seek him out.  The occasionally hints at the truth behind Mason's fun-house mirror of a life.  There's an ever-lit room down the hall of his apartment that he stares at, but (almost) never enters.  He has an enigmatic set of ""rules"" by which he sketches and paints.  And his love of jazz is so powerful, he can wax philosophic about the musical art at the drop of a hat.  ""Jazz isn't about accesibility. It's more difficult to relate to. It isn't friendly or clean.""  He talks about how jazz masters devote their lives to learning the rules, and when they get together, all they do is break those rules.  ""It's decadent and carnal, all at the same time.""

Hearing these lines, it's easy to suspect that the movie is setting you up for some kind of revealing pay-off, a glimpse at the way Mason's personality operates, but I'll save you the trouble by letting you know that they're only ballast.  Mason has almost no personality at all.  He's missing it the way some people miss a useful organ, and these words about jazz, it turns out, are his glass eye, his wooden leg.  The writers want us to believe he's a sympathetic human being, they want this small bit of dialogue to convince us that there's a working heart there, but there's no follow-through.

Instead, what you have is a great, steady mural of pure mood.  I'll grant that it's a finally molded mood, very patient, even probative in its way, and beautifully done.  The filming, the toning, the shades and hues: nice stuff.  This is perhaps why the movie is billed as being ""Hitchcockian,"" and in that vein, it fits the bill.  But Hitchcock also had some creative stories to tell, and creative characters to tell them with.  Atmosphere isn't enough.  Heck, with Hitchcock, half the time the atmosphere was in the dialogue, and in how it was said.  Here, it is in slow, lushly colored pans.  It is in artful cuts and framing.  It is, by no means, in the characters.

Which is the really sad part, because even the story has a bit of juice to it.  Never mind that you can see (at least one of) the twists coming from forty minutes away.  Audiences have grown so accustomed to twists that they're hard to pull off anymore with any degree of subtlety.  What's really agonizing about the movie is how glibly the film tries to pass off key plot points as artful blanks.  Sometimes films leave key questions unanswered as a way of escalating tension or interest.  But this kind of move is a cop-out if there's nothing to back it up.  Mason's rules, the ""final pose"" (a truly sinister and Hitchcockian idea), the very creepy room in Mason's very creepy apartment...

It's all window dressing, all of it, curtains framing an old brick wall. It's sad to see such talent, such attention to detail, when the big picture is nothing but a sloppy, cryptic mess. Others might appreciate the stylism and the well-dosed dreariness -- I did -- but don't expect anything with depth or meaning. Like Mason's canvases, this flick is flat, lifeless, and it goes nowhere.",1208131200,13,4678,4.804755944931164
3048419,3,B0010AN7LS,"Joel David Moore stars as Mason, a very obviously disturbed young man who seems ill at ease with life itself. It's only when he's painting, or spending time with his sole friend/boss (Zachary Levi) that Mason seems to live at all.

Then he meets Amber (Amber Tamblyn), a bubbly new co-worker who inexplicably decides to befriend him. Despite a lack of encouragement, Amber continues to spend time with Mason, attempting to draw him out of himself and to learn a little about his mysterious persona. Before long, Amber's actually succeeded -- Mason wants to use her as a model for his artwork.

Things seem to be going surprisingly well -- until one day in Mason's home, when Amber makes a shocking discovery and decides to confront Mason about it, to disastrous results.

Though the story drags a bit in a few parts, and seems choppy in a few others, the overall plot is intriguing and engrossing. Viewers will be in for a film that leaves them thinking and wondering long after the final scene.",1207699200,,995,4.706896551724138
3048420,4,B0010AN7LS,"Mason isn't exactly your everyday joe. He's an artist. A sketcher and a painter, but he's also incredibly quiet and tends to keep to himself. He has an office job where he tries to sell car insurance, but he doesn't exactly fit in with others. His only friend(if that's what you want to call him) is Berkeley, the boss. Berkeley comes off like he cares about Mason, but his compassion is overshadowed by the fact that he's a prick. Things start looking up for Mason as he meets Amber. After seeing Mason's sketches and getting to know him a little better, she decides she wants him to paint her. Mason's...odd side starts to reveal itself as he won't let Amber see his sketches. ""There are rules,"" he says, ""You can't see it until it's done."" As Amber gets closer to Mason, what can he be hiding? Why is he such an ""enigma,"" as Amber put it? Why does he keep having disturbing dreams about another woman?

Where do I start? I actually really liked this. I was expecting to as Adam Green and Joel David Moore were both involved with Hatchet, which is a guilty pleasure of mine. While Hatchet is half comedy and half gorefest, Spiral is more of a dramatic thriller that builds towards the ending. Spiral, while being low budget, is shot in superb fashion. The way its shot is actually its charm. I love the way the camera gets shaky during the scenes where Mason seems like he's going to lose it or when he finally does. Joel David Moore is also in top form here. His talent truly shines in this role. Everything from his body language to the way he chomps his teeth when he gets nervous, he sucks you in. You wind up feeling sorry for Mason even though you know he's twisted in some way. Witnessing his character unveil how dark really is is just amazing. The other actor I was really impressed with was Zachary Levi. I wound up becoming a fan of his with Chuck, but I've never seen him like this. He's basically a prick with a heart(even though that side of him is really only shown to Mason). While his role is a little small, he's still able to steal a few scenes...especially in the last half of the film. The other element that really adds to the film is the jazz music used. It fits perfectly with Mason's personality. Jazz music accentuates Mason's insanity that nothing else could. I really have nothing bad to say about the film.

This may surprise a few people, but Spiral is actually quite enjoyable. The acting is top notch and it's written incredibly well. For a movie that went straight to DVD, it's quite surprising how good it actually is. Even if you hated Hatchet, you should give Spiral a chance as it's a completely different kind of film.

3048422,3,B0010AN7LS,"This is the basis for this psychological thriller. Mason is an enigma, as so adeptly stated by Amber, a ""co-worker"" that befriends him one day at lunch. The movie starts and it has you wondering what terrible deed has Mason done?...and why? Immediately he reaches out to his boss, of all people, for comfort and support. We soon discover that his boss Berkley, is also a dear friend from high school.  Berkley apparently knows Mason and knows what happened to him in the past. He obviously feels that its his duty to protect Mason, keep him employed and defend him when necessary.

Mason is a painter and he has many paintings of one woman in different poses all over his loft. Whatever is troubling him about these paintings ceases temporarily after he throughs them all away. As unstable as he may be, Mason let's his guard down when Amber warms up to him. He is a man of few words but shockingly, more than  way through the movie, he speaks passionately about the one topic of interest he has as much as sketching...Jazz.  He is very opinionated about Jazz stating ""only the finest artists can master it"".  Can this be a reference to himself as an artist too?

Amber is witty and spontaneous, almost the total opposite of Mason.  But as soon as their relationship starts so does it end. What did Mason do to Amber? Is he so lost in the world since the death of his mother that he can no longer determine what are memories and what is imagination?

 Spiral had somewhat of the same premise as He Was A Quiet Man starring Christian Slater; the same office worker, loner guy who's about to lose it any minute. The movie did not succeed in its attempt to be a Hitchcock-like tail. Spiral did have great imagery and direction and it did keep my attention but it isn't a movie I'm ready to recommend you go out and purchase.  Check it out on Netflix or Blockbuster instead.",1206057600,3,1870,4.489675516224189
3048423,3,B0010AN7LS,"It's tough to be compared (or compare yourself) to Hitchcock, and unfortunately, Spiral doesn't get close to the tension and suspense of the late British great.  What Spiral does do is take a page from M. Night Shyamalan, and attempts to play with both conventions and viewer expectations.  It's creative enough, and certainly quite moody, but this film never quite hits the mark.  The acting is good but not great; the relationship between Amber and Mason does have its moments, though, and is generally pretty well developed.  I do have to give high marks for the mood and sound achievements- as a Portland resident, this film certainly feels like home!  Overall, I'd certainly recommend this to anyone with an interest in a psychological thriller- just don't go in expecting Hitchcock.",1206057600,,788,5.030769230769231

3048425,3,B0010AN7LS,"""Spiral"" doesn't seem to know what kind of film it wants to be.  Horror?  Psychological thriller?  A relationship film?  A commentary about misfits?  The unfolding of this story of socially inept Mason and the girl he hopes will ""be the one"" is slow and deliberate, with some scenes between them painfully awkward.  There are undercurrents of madness, obsession, and psychological torment, although these all have a vagueness that never sharpens into the horror suggested by the film's trailer.

Despite the flaws, ""Spiral"" remains an interesting film.  Joel David Moore seems to get inside Mason's skin, although he overdoes Mason's tortured personality so it hardly seems believable that he hangs out with the people he does.  Amber Tamblyn is thoroughly likeable as . . . Amber, but the chemistry between her and Moore never quites succeeds.  The cinematography is adept, with its hues of orange and red, and the use of rain.

The extras offer nothing special (except the trailer, which is interesting only because it splices all the tense moments into a minute that perhaps bests the film itself).

This film is a decent way to spend an evening, but I don't recommend going out of your way to see it.",1205884800,14,1204,4.935323383084577

At the end, you're left with questions that you think you might discover the answer to if you watched it just one more time.

Spiral tells the story of Mason, a quiet, nerdy guy who has never been to the movies and who spends all his free time sketching, painting, and listening to old jazz. He has frequent panic attacks which are linked to memories from his past. He doesn't seem to have any friends except an old friend from high school that hires him as a telemarketer and who seems to be the only one who understands his panic attacks. However, this changes one day when an outgoing new telemarketer named Amber befriends him at lunch. Mason doesn't say much, but Amber persists. Eventually, she convinces Mason to paint her ... and Mason seems to become more and more normal until Amber stumbles upon something that alerts her to just how psychologically bothered Mason really is.

To say more about the plot would be to ruin the movie. But I insist that this is not just a movie about life as a telemarketer or about how a quiet guy is brought out of his shell by a girl. It's a disturbing story about letting ourselves believe what we want to believe. It's a story of illusions. And the movie plot is more brilliant the more you think about it.",1205884800,,2442,5.856741573033708

That is until Mason meets Amber (Amber Tamblyn), an adorable (though sometimes overly so) girl who works in the same building and is also in need of a friend.

Skillfully and deceptively marketed as some sort of terrifying slasher film through a very misleading trailer, ""Spiral"" is actually an extremely satisfying, even Hitchcockian suspense-romance, wonderfully played out with superb performances and great jazz music. It's not quite perfect. I would have liked a bit more information about the characters to be revealed, and I wasn't totally comfortable with the non-jazz music in the end, but I think that was more about the chosen piece itself.  Yet, it is well worth seeing and even owning. Just don't expect an outright horror film like the trailer, included as an extra, would have you believe. Other extras are a ""making of"" (it's really just random behind the scenes footage),  three brief Starz promotional looks at the making, and a great commentary with co-director Adam Green and stars Joel David Moore (who is also co-director and co-writer), Amber Tamblyn, and Zachary Levi, plus co-writer/producer Jeremy Boreing and director of photography Will Barrett.

3048428,4,B0010AN7LS,"I was definitely surprised by the quality of this indie film, based on the product description I have to confess I expected something very different so it really was a pleasant surprise. Something worth mentioning is that this is more of a psychological-terror film, so do not be deceived by the label ""Terror"". To give you an idea this movie is in the same line as `Fight Club' and `The Machinist', my intention is not to compare the movies but to give you an idea of what to expect.

Cinematography (as other reviewers have mentioned) is great, Joel David Moore is excellent as Mason, Amber Tamblyn's acting is ok but nothing great; to me, Moore's portrayal of Mason is what steals the film. Without giving any details to reveal the plot, the movie captured me from the very beginning, there are some disturbing sequences that do not reveal anything but have you wanting to know or guess what the main character's past is. Something I liked is the camera movement every time Mason wasn't feeling ok, the movement captured the moment and gave the sense of instability the character was feeling.

The movie does leave loose ends but in a good sense, rather than giving away all the info they leave you thinking about those unsolved pieces of the puzzle (what was the last pose? What was behind that door?) The film may feel a little slow at first but it is indeed setting all the pieces in place to surprise you with a nice twist at the end; I thought I had seen it coming when I watched it and then, another twist!

Another thing to note is the soundtrack, they accommodated all that jazz in the right places at the right times.

The DVD contains the trailer and some `making of' documentaries that explain how this indie film was made, Dolby Surround 2.0 and 5.1 and no subtitles (it is closed captioned though)

Amber Tamblin was great as well but again, you would never believe that she was interested in Mason. He was freaky looking and obviously had massive emotional problems, what from you ask? Well we'd all love to know more history on Mason but very little was provided - flashbacks would have worked nicely in this film or even begining the story when Mason was younger and flashing forward. Regardless, this movie could have been much better. The second half of the movie was definitely more entertaining and suspensfull but I couldn't watch this movie again and if I hadn't committed to reviewing this for vine I would have given up on it a lot earlier.

3048430,3,B0010AN7LS,"So this one tells of a strange, ill-fitting romance. It's also a claustrophobic psychological thriller, taking place in a dreary and drizzly Portland. Mason is the creepy, asthmatic insurance telemarketer who leads a lonely, solitary life. And, as per norm with tightly wound up, deeply disturbed recluses, he holds in some seriously pent up stuff. His art and his jazz collection are seemingly his only means of release and source of comfort. It's curious, though, that Mason is always sketching his subjects in the same poses (it makes you go, ""Hmmm...). His sole means to companionship lies in his mysoginist boss, Berkeley (Zachary Levi), with whom he shares an addled friendship. From the start, we're aware that Mason has been having recurring nightmares concerning a bathroom door and a girl who might or might not have been brutally murdered.

But then his sunny and offbeat co-worker Amber (Amber Tamblyn) takes an interest in him. In Amber's effervescent presence Mason finally relaxes enough to let his guard down. But, maybe, just maybe, it would've been better if Mason had been left alone. Because this isn't a typical love story. As Mason becomes more comfortable in his own skin, this leaves the way open to something dark which has always skulked just beneath his neuroses.

SPIRAL is one of those quietly unsettling films which you can't really sit thru without feeling squirmy. Even in the early stages, when the story is basically a character study, a sense of discomfort is fostered, brought about mostly by a focusing on Mason's off-kiltered and fairly effed-up private world. About two-thirds of SPIRAL is locked into the evolution of Mason and Amber's uneasy relationship, as well as tidbits here and there of Mason and Berkeley interacting. Gradually, the film takes on a noirish texture; a sense of ugliness and a horrific anticipation creep up as we learn potentially frightening things about our guy.

I wasn't sure if the languid pace would be able to keep my eyeballs glued to the screen. But, it turns out, the film drops enough points of interest and jumpy moments to maintain my backpocket in a parked position. While I wasn't predisposed to liking Mason, I couldn't help but be fascinated by (and leery of) him, so I hung around to see what makes him tick.  Mason is a painful character to watch, confounded as he is by his inner demons. Joel David Moore plays Mason, and he not only takes on the lead role but also co-writes and co-directs this low-budgeted indie. Acting wise, Moore is solid, even if his character isn't so sympathetic (he's a bit too creepy for that). Yet you still feel a bit for the poor, awkward bastard.

I picked up SPIRAL mostly because of Zachary Levi, who's simply tremendous in his nerdy leading man role in CHUCK. I'll tell you what, Levi's Berkeley is pretty far removed from his Chuck Bartowski. That's some decent acting range. I think what makes Berkeley an appealing character - despite his boorish, womanizing nature - is his constant loyalty to his social misfit of a buddy. Amber Tamblyn, who was so good in JOAN OF ARCADIA and so forgettable in THE GRUDGE 2, shows off her stuff as Mason's warm and bubbly friend and then girlfriend. Watch Amber subtly work in her expressions, as her character, in turns, becomes drawn to, perplexed by, and, finally, increasingly nervous of the new dude in her life. Amber's good. I still miss JOAN OF ARCADIA.

An aside now: for fans of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, there's a miniscule sighting of Tricia Helfer. She's in several minutes of a Christmas dinner scene, looking good in a sexy red thing. But then she's gone.

I like that not everything is spelled out. What's up with the postcards? Did the movie ever unveil the final page that Mason ripped out in his sketchbook? I don't recall seeing it. His troubled childhood is hinted at but never probed in detail. And what's the story behind Mason and Berkeley's longstanding but odd-duck friendship? Things to perhaps fleetingly ponder, post-viewing. There are two twists in the film's final segment, one of which is a revelation dropped by Berkeley. But, once the film was over, I couldn't help but re-evaluate Berkeley's assertion, and if it had any merit at all.

Bonus features time. The disc has an easy-going audio commentary by the filmmakers, including Joel David Moore, Amber Tamblyn and Zachary Levi (they're a fun-loving bunch). There's also ""Spinning Spiral: The Making Of SPIRAL"" - a negligible if breezy seven minutes of on-camera tomfoolery by cast and crew. This segment doesn't really offer much insight into the film itself. Insignificantly, there are also promos and the trailer. Basically, if you liked the film, I recommend checking out the much relaxed audio commentary (where it's learned that SPIRAL started out as a short film).

3048431,2,B0010AN7LS,"Poor Amber Tamblyn, since the unceremonious cancellation of Joan of Arcadia, she has been slumming it in movies about pants, bad Japanese remakes, straight to DVD flicks,  Hallmark movies and failed zombie shows.  Her latest step into obscurity is with another straight to DVD outing, the psychological thriller Spriral where she plays the most interesting character.  Although Zach Levi gives her a run for her money, even though with the short hair and beard looks more like Jesse Metcalf than Chuck Bartowski.

But the movie belongs to Joel David Moore (Hatchet) in every sense of the word as besides being the main character he also co-directed and co-wrote the movie.  So when he is what brings down the movie, you only have him to blame because whether you blame him, how it was written, or directed, in the end it all fall on him.

Moore plays you token introvert working as a telemarketer under the eyes of Levi who has looked after him since high school and has been his only friend throughout that time.  Not that Levi is the most nurturing friend who thinks being there and telling him the truths are enough.  But Moore starts to turn around when he meets the carefree Tamblyn.
The big twist at the end of the movie makes things interesting, but once the twist is reveled, it is easy to predict a second twist, which turns out to be one too many.

Though we are told Berkely and Mason are lifelong friends and the script more than hints at Mason's tragic family past there is nothing we are shown in Berkely's ambitious selfish personality that really explains why he is such a loyal, protective friend to Mason.  The other unbelievable element concerns Mason's relationship with  Amber.  Though Amber is portrayed as a bit quirky herself she seems too attractive and articulate to be the initiator in a romantic relationship with troubled Mason.

Two twists are revealed in the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. One of the twists  surprised me and the other did not.  The storyline is coherent and the filmmakers are wise in leaving a few unanswered questions for the viewer to think about instead of over explaining everything.  The well realized setting of Portland, Oregon in early winter is a bit different and adds realism and interest to the film as does the original jazz music that makes up most of the soundtrack.  This film is no classic but it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half either.",1205452800,,1562,4.988416988416988
3048433,5,B0010AN7LS,"From the very beginning of the movie, two things are clear.

First, this isn't some big-budget Hollywood thriller whose high-profile casting and slick production values are meant to lure you into believing the film is markedly better than it actually is.

And secondly, despite being a low budget movie, that this is indeed a well made film that grabs your attention right away and promises to be a compelling tale. And for me personally, this movie pays off on its promises quite well.

This is the story of Mason (portrayed brilliantly by co-writer and co-director Joel David Moore), a withdrawn and clearly disturbed man who has many problems, including severe asthma, and a past that seems to haunt his every day life. From the very first scene we're led to believe that he's done something terrible involving a woman whose portrait he has drawn or painted several times, and fills his apartment. Without going too deeply into the plot (which other reviews have already explored, I'm sure), suffice it to say that over time, Mason meets and begins to fall in love with a new woman, Amber Tamblyn, whom then becomes the new object of his obsession.

What I like about this story is that it seems to intentionally avoid turning into one of the gory, slasher, blood-bath movies that seem to be all the rage these days. I think the comparisons with Hitchcocking horror are a bit stretched, but it's not completely irrelevant either. This is a psychological horror tale that explores the human frailties and the desperate need for acceptance that most of us face on some level each day. Both the lead character, Mason, and his new girlfriend Amber seem to both be looking for that special someone who will fill out the missing parts and make them whole. The fact that they find each other, and that for a while you really begin to hope and pray that this ends in the proverbial ""And They Lived Happily Ever After"" is a direct testament to the acting of Moore and Tamblyn.

The movie's plot isn't the greatest, but frankly, it's a simple movie and a simple tale, and I think it's the perfect vehicle in which the actors themselves should be allowed to carry the movie, which they did to great effect. And given the fact that this is a horror movie and are fairly certain that a happy ending just isn't in the cards, it's hard to expect a film like this to have a new and innovative ending. And yet, I have to admit that the twist that ensues did in fact surprise me and left me feeling sad. The movie treats Mason as a flawed human being who is worthy of compassion, rather than the mindless monster of a man without a soul that populates most horror stories today, and I found that, and the lack of copious amounts of fake blood splattering the screen, to be quite refreshing.

The movie is not perfect, but in my opinion nothing ever is anyway. But what it is is a very well done, straightforward, psychological horror of a man for who you expect the worst from, but find yourself hoping for the best for. And as a writer who fancies himself merely an old-fashioned storyteller, this is one of the better told stories I've seen in a while.

3048434,5,B0010AN7LS,"This genuine murder mystery thriller is chilling in its plot development, as it keeps the viewer glued to the screen anticipating the unknown after being introduced to Mason, a geek, who is also a talented artist, who works for an insurance company, as a telemarketer. There is a corridor in his apartment which seems to be hiding a secret. It beckons to Mason at times but he avoids it. There are deep emotional scars hidden within Mason's mind which gradually become evident as he listens to jazz and engages in sketching. His mind wanders to either dreams or real events which haunt him. The story unfolds gradually, revealing details about Mason's lonely existence, as he washes his soiled hands of what could be blood or red paint. Despite Mason's peculiar quiet withdrawn behavior he is protected by his boss when Mason arrives late to work. Berkley, his boss, knows Mason's history. Berkley goes out of his way to include Mason in activties, such as shooting basketball and also a Christmas dinner. Berkley is a bit arrogant and a ladies man, a handsome macho guy who is secure in his job and of his ability to win over women.

Mason packs a brown bag lunch daily and often eats it outside on a bench. There he meets a new employee Amber, who notices Mason's sketches of a pretty lady about which he is rather secretive. Mason is withdrawn but gradually befriends the vivacious and perky Amber who shows interest in him. She goes out of her way to sit with him at lunch and walk him home under her umbrella during a rainy day. She invents ways to meet him and eventually they date. She is invited to his bachelor's apartment and becomes a model for him to paint. Mason takes a bus ride to a cemetery where he visits the grave of his mother, where nearby, a young boy is attending a funeral but breaks away and goes behind a tree to cry ... alone ... the situation is very eery. Somehow it becomes symbolic of Mason's own life.

As Amber continues sitting and posing for Mason, she becomes more and more emotionally involved and one day, they make love. She also becomes more curious about his love of jazz and the sketches he has done . He invites her to his apartment again. The viewer then discovers the sinister secrets which Mason has been hiding. This film is superbly done and totally involves the viewer in the convoluted mind and twisted feelings of Mason as the truth behind his quietness and hidden behavior is revealed. This is a most highly recommended film. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1205193600,2,2506,4.604026845637584
3048435,4,B0010AN7LS,"""Spiral"" is a dark thriller starring Joel David Moore (more familiar to audiences as a goofy comedic presence from ""Dodgeball"" and ""Grandma's Boy"" and who also co-directed and co-wrote the script) as lonely telemarketer Mason who spends his off hours painting. Mason's only real friend is his boss (Zachary Levi), until he is befriended by a slightly off-kilter woman (Amber Tamblyn (whose father Russ also has a cameo in the film) who shares his loneliness. The film is slow-paced, which might drive some people away but will only draw others in further. There are also loose ends which go unresolved (what is up with Mason's parents, for example?). The cinematography is impressive as well as the dreary, rainy locale jazz-inspired score, which gives this modern movie a film noir feel. ""Spiral"" is also slightly reminiscent of the disturbed loner films of Roman Polanski (""Tenant"" for example); while not ever rising to that level of cinematic art, it does portray the lead character in a similar way, where fantasy and reality intersect and overlap, leaving the viewer to guess which one is which. There are several twists in the film, which may or may not be surprising to the careful viewer. All in all, a very dark and intense film for the choosy film-viewer.",1205193600,,1266,4.948356807511737

3048437,3,B0010AN7LS,"SPOILER ALERT? O.K. Depending on how sensitive to certain aspects of what follows you are, (stay with me, this becomes- I Hope- clearer) there may be any number of spoilers involved... or not.
 First, we have to deal with the whole aspect of a picture with a ""twist"" ending. No that's not a spoiler, films like this always have a twist ending. But that's the problem! Just knowing there is one can, if you're into films like this, give the ending away! As an old-time fan of weird flicks I, and quite a few of my friends, figured out the ""twist"" of ""The Sixth Sense"" once we knew there was one. Sure the first reviewers were stunned, but we knew immediately that either A) Willis was dead B) the kid was dead or C) they both were. Then it was only an exercise in seeing how well it was done. Conversely, none of us quite figured out the twist of ""The Usual Suspects"" if only because it was so arbitrary. While ""Spiral"" is nowhere near as good as the two films above, it is well made, has some very clever (and not unfunny) dialogue and a twist that, while not on a par with ""Sixth Sense"" is certainly more earned than ""Suspects"". PLUS it has Amber Tamblyn and that means it is worth seeing. And it has a pre-Chuck Zachary Levi who's always interesting. In short, it's a pretty good example of the kind of B movie suspense film they not only DO still make, they make a lot worse than this one. A decent little time-killer.",1205020800,,1421,4.322097378277154
3048438,3,B0010AN7LS,"Seems like one of the new go-to themes in movies is the nerdy guy in the cubicle who just might be a dangerous psychotic.  Before long, we might have to change ""going postal"" to ""going cubicle.""  Well, here's another one.  Joel David Moore stars/co-writes/co-directs this tale of Mason, an insurance telemarketer by day/painter by night who is in contention for the Most Socially Awkward Man title (introvert division).  Mason has frequent episodes in which he awakes from a fitful sleep with the panicked impression that he just might have killed a girl who was modeling for his painting.  He immediately calls his boyhood pal and current boss, Berkeley (Zachary Levi), who calms him down and assures him to take his meds and everything will be fine.

After a while, Mason meets Amber (Amber Tamblyn), a fellow brown-bag lunch type at their generic company.  Amber doggedly ignores the veritable neon sign flashing ""Creepy"" and ""Awkward"" intermittently, for reasons that are essentially plot driven and unapparent to the audience.  Eventually, she notices Mason's sketchbook, which reinforces her determination to repress the natural inclination to shudder and back away very slowly from this dude.  And yes, she will be Mason's next model and muse.

There are plenty of options from that set up.  Maybe it's a special edition of Beauty and the Geek, in which a beautiful and bubbly girl can see through the total absence of available personality and save the tortured, sensitive and inwardly beautiful geek.  Maybe it's A Beautiful Mind, set to painting instead of math.  Maybe there really is a slasher in there.  Or perhaps a combo plate of some of the above with other stuff they've whipped up here.  Or maybe something else altogether, and they're messing with us to throw everyone off track.

The acting is excellent - Mason is believably twitchy, tortured and weird.  Amber is adorable, sweet and quirky, albeit not really quirky enough to justify such an interest in Mason.  Berkeley is fine as a one-note insensitive cad who apparently grew fond of Mason before losing all other human emotions.  The dialogue is problematic, however.  The interplay between Mason and Amber just doesn't ring true for the first half of the movie, and the transitions in their relationship are somewhat leaden.  The twists-and-turns promised by all the promotional references to Hitchcock provide variable levels of satisfaction, and it should be noted that at least one of them is adapted from other, better films.  All in all, Spiral is at best a fall-back rental when the video store is out of your top choices.",1204934400,,2605,5.023310023310024
3048439,3,B0010AN7LS,"I found myself quite engrossed in this movie.  In a way I was surprised, having expected a more typical horror flick.  Instead, ""Spiral"" is a very effective blend of brooding drama and slow-building suspense.

The basic storyline concerns an athsmatic 30ish call center drone named Mason (Joel David Moore). He is socially awkward and obviously psychologically troubled in some way.  Early on, we see Mason making what apparently is a fairly regular middle-of-the-night phone call to his boss Berkeley (Zachary Levi), having awoken suddenly from a nightmare. Berkeley is a patient employer who has an interesting friendship (of sorts) with Mason. Through their conversations we learn bits and pieces about Mason's past.

What seems to keep him going are his twin passions: painting and jazz music.  He is an active participant in the former, and a devout fan of the latter. He began his painting hobby by recreating classic jazz album covers, and now seems to exclusively concentrate on the female form. He has many notebooks of sketches, each one labelled with a different female name.

Mason's worldview seems to improve slowly upon meeting a young woman named Amber (Amber Tamblyn).  The two develop a friendship that starts with stilted lunch-break conversation, blossoming over time to something much deeper.  Amber finds Mason intriguing - she responds to his 'tortured artist' vibe.  Mason responds to her openmindedness (and attractiveness).  She quickly becomes the subject of his latest series of paintings. Giving away more would be dirty pool. Suffice it to say, Mason's mental instability becomes a serious detriment to his new relationship.

The acting by the principles is very good.  Joel David Moore manages to infuse Mason with just enough humanity to keep him sympathetic.  Amber Tamblyn is extremely likeable as Amber.  Zachery Levi gives Berkeley an unusual mix of corporate jerk (when he's at work) and nuturing big brother (in his scenes with Mason).

Whether or not you'll see where this is all heading probably depends, in part, on how many movies you've seen.  I am usually horrible at figuring out how suspense movies will end, so it should be taken with a grain of salt that I managed to have a pretty good idea prior to the credits rolling.  That shouldn't be a deterrent, however, from checking out this movie.

Without giving anything away - I didn't understand why a string of (apparently) a dozen or so pretty girls found themselves romantically drawn to the main character.

His boss - buddy - defender at least hinted that they were somehow high-school classmates.  This kind of explains his connection - but does not satisfactorally tell us why he feels so protective.

This movie is really not worth the time or money you would spend to watch it.  The acting is passable if uninspired, with the protagonist being the best we get.  He does a fair job of portraying a disturbed artist, but the background of the character is so fragile and thin and arrives so late that it makes the story a failure.  The relationships are terribly developed, and would make the people in them suicidal should they exist in real life.  The total apathy and disregard the supporting cast feels towards the protagonist for most of the film is depressing.  I actually liked the character of the best friend, who displays some compassion as he describes why he is the main character's friend.

The story purports to have a twist at the end, which is very poorly executed and not at all surprising, and would have been so either way it could have gone.  There is nothing in the cinematography that is remarkable, and the semi-focus on jazz music is incomplete when it could have been used as a real focus of the plot.  The soundtrack is uninspired and the overall feeling I had after viewing the movie was disappointment.

Joel David Moore does a fabulous job of capturing the odd mannerisms and overall loser personality of the character, and the ever-cute Amber Tamblyn (why in the world did Joan of Arcadia go off the air?) is a wonderful actress who always brings naturalness to her portrayals.

I can't say that I agree with the blurbs on the DVD jacket - ""Hitchcock-tail"" and ""startling imagery"" - but the unraveling of Moore's character is well done.

There is nothing exceptionally scarey about this film, even in the commentary the co-director/Writer/Producers, admit to leaving in a sound sting where there is not meant to be anything scarey at all. Even with the frenetic ability that some indie producers have to raise money, the fact that some of these people were associated with HATCHET, a film with some fairly good FX, if scant story line, is a little bit of a worry; HATCHET showed that a good indie film can benefit from some name actors and a DP who knows the business.

Working at an insurance company as a telemarketer, Mason is a guy who seems to have some psychological issues.  His boss Berkley (Zachary Levi from TV's Chuck) is also his friend, and is rather free with giving Mason personal advice.  Mason is an artist, and his sketches draw the attention of Amber (Amber Tamblyn), a new employee at the company.

The two form an odd, but sweet kind of relationship, as Amber eventually convinces Mason to paint her portrait.  Pleased with the results, Amber poses for additional paintings.  Just when they have become close, a dagger of suspicion changes everything.

Mason seems to become more human as the story progresses, and it is possible at times to envision he and Amber as players in some flighty romantic comedy, almost up until the final dark turn.  With strong performances by Joel David Moore and Amber Tamblyn (Joan of Arcadia), Spiral is a film best viewed with a minimum of foreknowledge.  It's mostly an interesting and compelling watch, albeit one with a number of really large plot holes.

I had mixed feelings about the base of the film but the ending made up for it. I found the actors did a wonderful job and the mystery was on point but the movie moved at a snail's pace to the point where you might not even make it to the end and the end is the best part.

I won't go into what this film is all about. It's a film where even the smallest of disclosures could be a spoiler. This is a film where you're gonna have to be patient, analyze and watch until the end. If you miss the ending, you might as well not even watch any of it. The ending ties it altogether.

The movie's strong points were the chemistry between the main characters, the emotions and how characters react to each other. The film feels very realistic and with a faster pace, this could give Psycho a run for its money.

If not so slow and if had more conflict, I probably would've given it 4 or 5 stars. You'll have to be extremely patient with this but I recommend it if you like psychological thrillers.",1309996800,,1187,4.147826086956521

Just as she begins to break down his barriers and he begins to show signs of life while painting her portraits, Amber discovers that she may not be the first person to see the tip of his paintbrush, though she may be the last... Joel David Moore is perfectly fitting as Mason, delivering the cold and empty performance that the role required. The steady build allows Amber and the viewer ample time to get in to Mason's head, but just as he starts to open up to become a likable character, a sudden reveal immediately ramps up the terror and turns the tables on our social misfit. Moore's writing and direction under Adam Green's supervision demonstrate a great deal of potential here, and are aided by crisp visuals and expert framing. Mason's declining mental state is alluded to on screen in a series of visual metaphors seen in the approaching storm, electrical outages, and increasingly shaky camera work. While many of the plot twists are easily predictable, SPIRAL produces a solid psychological thriller based on strong performances and a sound structure.

3282905,5,B0010AN7LS,"Spiral was nothing short of genius.

The acting was amazing especially by David Joel Moore who also starred in Hatchet another of Adam Green's films.

Some might think the movie a bit slow but I see it as  building a foundation and great Character development something you don't see enough in a lot of films  lately. Moore plays Mason, an introverted and emotionally disturbed man who goes to work at a drab job and  also leisurely loves to paint. He loves to paint beautiful women. Amber Tamblyn plays the new girl ""Amber""at Mason's place of employment and she for some reason is drawn to him' after a few lunch time meetings Mason starts painting Amber when she visits his Apartment "" One that holds many secrets"" .

They strike up an friendship that leads to somewhat of a love affair.

This is when it all starts to unravel..

What ensues next is intense and I couldn't stop watching. The story is amazing and the ambiguous nature of some of the content is also genius because it allows us to come to our own conclusion. There is a line in the film that I can't get out of my head, It's when Mason is talking to his brother Berkley ""Zackary Levi"", the line is "" How do you know if Their real or not?""

3282912,3,B0010AN7LS,"Spiral is a passable thriller that has its bits of cleverness, but overall is merely average.  The principal character (played by Joel David Moore) is a telemarketer by day and artist by night who, as the movie opens, has apparently committed a murder.  I say apparently because we never see a body and it's clear from the get-go that this guy is not all there.  Also implied is that the victim was a waitress he seemed obsessed by.

Into his life comes a co-worker (Amber Tamblyn) who takes an instant shine to him and becomes the model for his latest set of paintings.  The two become closer as he repeats his previous cycle of paintings featuring the waitress; will it end as badly?

While competently directed, acted and written, the movie also suffers from flaws.  The big one is plausibility:  I could never buy Tamblyn's character pursuing this guy:  he is just too antisocial, and she is too attractive (in personality and appearance) to have him as the only option in her life.

Then there is the big plot twist at the end, which I (and probably many others) could see coming a mile away, followed by a second twist that, while clever, still stretches the credibility problems.  The good and bad in Spiral balance out, making this a three star flick:  not good enough to merit watching if something else is available, not bad enough to be a waste of time if you did see it.",1209254400,,1382,4.550607287449393
3282913,4,B0010AN7LS,Sprial was a decent movie. It wasn't really scary at all. I found that it was just freaky seeing what went on through the whole movie. The ending caught me off guard though.

3282914,5,B0010AN7LS,"I'm used to liking certain films that seem to engender only a lukewarm response from a majority of viewers, but I have to draw a line in the sand when it comes to Spiral.  This is a brilliant film on so many levels, an outr&eacute; work of cinematic art that marches to the sound of its own uniquely discordant drum, pushing and pulling the viewer to an ending that does not disappoint in the slightest.  I will grant the fact that the film moves at a leisurely pace that some might find boring, and people who have lived their whole lives immersed in the ""in crowd"" might look down their noses at the protagonist without even making an effort to sympathize with (let alone relate to) him, but this is a very human story that cuts far too wide a swath across the emotional landscape to be pigeonholed into any one constraining genre.  Maybe some viewers were expecting more of an actual horror film along the lines of Hatchet, since Spiral reunites co-writer Joel David Moore and co-director Adam Green from that earlier project, but these guys are obviously true filmmakers devoted to their craft and determined to spread their wings rather than settle for churning out one slasher after another.

Spiral's story revolves around Mason (Joel David Moore), a troubled fellow who is so far out of the mainstream he makes me look normal and popular.  Our first encounter with him shows just how vulnerable and possibly deranged he is, and this image is further reinforced by the mysterious dark secret lurking behind one of the doors in his apartment and the frightening visions that haunt his dreams.  At work, he seems incapable of actually associating with anyone other than his boss and long-time friend Berkeley (Zachary Levi) - until, that is, a new employee named Amber (Amber Tamlyn) decides to join him on his lonely bench during lunch and strikes up a friendship with him.  Amber's a hard nut to crack; spontaneous and outwardly emotional (not to mention hot), she's the very opposite of Mason, yet she obviously likes him despite all of his obvious problems.  Their awkward friendship slowly grows into a more meaningful relationship when she begins posing for Mason, who is quite the artist.  In fact, art seems to be the one safe refuge that Mason can cling to in life - actually, safe may not be the right word, for his sketches and paintings reveal troubling portents of obsession.

If you want every little thing explained to you in detail at the end, Spiral may not be your movie, but the whole story makes perfect sense.  This is a film that could have ended very badly, but all of the painstaking detail and effort that went into the movie up until that point is more than aptly rewarded with a conclusion that I consider well-nigh perfect (and not necessarily predictable).  I was particularly impressed by the symbolism built into the presentation, as it quietly magnifies the significance of everything that happens, especially in the closing moments.  The film's jazz soundtrack helps maintain a surreal atmosphere that plays up the whole reality vs. fantasy angle that drives the story along (although it also reminded me just how much I detest light jazz).  And all of that stuff about the story progressing so slowly in the beginning - it's called pacing, and I think it's spot-on in this case.  The more you're able to wallow in the dysfunctional lives of these characters, the more effective the shock ending becomes.

In case you can't tell, I love this movie.  I think it's a work of multi-faceted brilliance.",1208390400,,3536,4.770491803278689
3282915,2,B0010AN7LS,"SPIRAL is very much a vanity piece.  Two of its executive producers hold starring roles, and it is co-written and co-directed by its leading man, Joel David Moore (who was so much better in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Art-School-Confidential/dp/B000H6SXSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Art School Confidential</a>).  There's one thing that can be said of vanity: it does provide unity of vision.

Unfortunately, it does not also provide clarity, at least in any great amount.  SPIRAL tells the tale of a socially stunted painter who is so scrunched up within himself and his past, that he shows to the world very little other than a neurotic tendency to clap his teeth together.  Mason is our painter, a chin-less, spine-less, quivering Jell-O mold of a man who is at his ablest when in front of the canvas.  Mason does such a terrific job of portraying this mental defective, that you will probably find him as grating as a hangnail from frame number one.

Irony of ironies, the two people who are most central to his life are equally mind-numbing.  His boss and best friend is the inexplicable Berkeley (Zachary Levi), a lascivious man-whore who hires employees based on cup size.  The girl Mason befriends at work, Amber (Amber Tamblyn), is the human equivalent of an over-carbonated Sprite.  Neither one of these people have any new or interesting things to say.  Both of them appear to have purchased their personalities wholesale.  And they contrast so grotesquely with Mason's facial-tic of a life, that it is only by a supreme amount of mental effort that one can imagine why they endure his presence at all, let alone seek him out.  The occasionally hints at the truth behind Mason's fun-house mirror of a life.  There's an ever-lit room down the hall of his apartment that he stares at, but (almost) never enters.  He has an enigmatic set of ""rules"" by which he sketches and paints.  And his love of jazz is so powerful, he can wax philosophic about the musical art at the drop of a hat.  ""Jazz isn't about accesibility. It's more difficult to relate to. It isn't friendly or clean.""  He talks about how jazz masters devote their lives to learning the rules, and when they get together, all they do is break those rules.  ""It's decadent and carnal, all at the same time.""

Hearing these lines, it's easy to suspect that the movie is setting you up for some kind of revealing pay-off, a glimpse at the way Mason's personality operates, but I'll save you the trouble by letting you know that they're only ballast.  Mason has almost no personality at all.  He's missing it the way some people miss a useful organ, and these words about jazz, it turns out, are his glass eye, his wooden leg.  The writers want us to believe he's a sympathetic human being, they want this small bit of dialogue to convince us that there's a working heart there, but there's no follow-through.

Instead, what you have is a great, steady mural of pure mood.  I'll grant that it's a finally molded mood, very patient, even probative in its way, and beautifully done.  The filming, the toning, the shades and hues: nice stuff.  This is perhaps why the movie is billed as being ""Hitchcockian,"" and in that vein, it fits the bill.  But Hitchcock also had some creative stories to tell, and creative characters to tell them with.  Atmosphere isn't enough.  Heck, with Hitchcock, half the time the atmosphere was in the dialogue, and in how it was said.  Here, it is in slow, lushly colored pans.  It is in artful cuts and framing.  It is, by no means, in the characters.

Which is the really sad part, because even the story has a bit of juice to it.  Never mind that you can see (at least one of) the twists coming from forty minutes away.  Audiences have grown so accustomed to twists that they're hard to pull off anymore with any degree of subtlety.  What's really agonizing about the movie is how glibly the film tries to pass off key plot points as artful blanks.  Sometimes films leave key questions unanswered as a way of escalating tension or interest.  But this kind of move is a cop-out if there's nothing to back it up.  Mason's rules, the ""final pose"" (a truly sinister and Hitchcockian idea), the very creepy room in Mason's very creepy apartment...

It's all window dressing, all of it, curtains framing an old brick wall. It's sad to see such talent, such attention to detail, when the big picture is nothing but a sloppy, cryptic mess. Others might appreciate the stylism and the well-dosed dreariness -- I did -- but don't expect anything with depth or meaning. Like Mason's canvases, this flick is flat, lifeless, and it goes nowhere.",1208131200,13,4678,4.804755944931164

He has an office job where he tries to sell car insurance, but he doesn't exactly fit in with others. His only friend(if that's what you want to call him) is Berkeley, the boss. Berkeley comes off like he cares about Mason, but his compassion is overshadowed by the fact that he's a prick. Things start looking up for Mason as he meets Amber. After seeing Mason's sketches and getting to know him a little better, she decides she wants him to paint her. Mason's...odd side starts to reveal itself as he won't let Amber see his sketches. ""There are rules,"" he says, ""You can't see it until it's done."" As Amber gets closer to Mason, what can he be hiding? Why is he such an ""enigma,"" as Amber put it? Why does he keep having disturbing dreams about another woman?

Where do I start? I actually really liked this. I was expecting to as Adam Green and Joel David Moore were both involved with Hatchet, which is a guilty pleasure of mine. While Hatchet is half comedy and half gorefest, Spiral is more of a dramatic thriller that builds towards the ending. Spiral, while being low budget, is shot in superb fashion. The way its shot is actually its charm. I love the way the camera gets shaky during the scenes where Mason seems like he's going to lose it or when he finally does. Joel David Moore is also in top form here. His talent truly shines in this role. Everything from his body language to the way he chomps his teeth when he gets nervous, he sucks you in. You wind up feeling sorry for Mason even though you know he's twisted in some way. Witnessing his character unveil how dark really is is just amazing. The other actor I was really impressed with was Zachary Levi. I wound up becoming a fan of his with Chuck, but I've never seen him like this. He's basically a prick with a heart(even though that side of him is really only shown to Mason). While his role is a little small, he's still able to steal a few scenes...especially in the last half of the film. The other element that really adds to the film is the jazz music used. It fits perfectly with Mason's personality. Jazz music accentuates Mason's insanity that nothing else could. I really have nothing bad to say about the film.

This may surprise a few people, but Spiral is actually quite enjoyable. The acting is top notch and it's written incredibly well. For a movie that went straight to DVD, it's quite surprising how good it actually is. Even if you hated Hatchet, you should give Spiral a chance as it's a completely different kind of film.

3282919,3,B0010AN7LS,"This is the basis for this psychological thriller. Mason is an enigma, as so adeptly stated by Amber, a ""co-worker"" that befriends him one day at lunch. The movie starts and it has you wondering what terrible deed has Mason done?...and why? Immediately he reaches out to his boss, of all people, for comfort and support. We soon discover that his boss Berkley, is also a dear friend from high school.  Berkley apparently knows Mason and knows what happened to him in the past. He obviously feels that its his duty to protect Mason, keep him employed and defend him when necessary.

Mason is a painter and he has many paintings of one woman in different poses all over his loft. Whatever is troubling him about these paintings ceases temporarily after he throughs them all away. As unstable as he may be, Mason let's his guard down when Amber warms up to him. He is a man of few words but shockingly, more than  way through the movie, he speaks passionately about the one topic of interest he has as much as sketching...Jazz.  He is very opinionated about Jazz stating ""only the finest artists can master it"".  Can this be a reference to himself as an artist too?

Amber is witty and spontaneous, almost the total opposite of Mason.  But as soon as their relationship starts so does it end. What did Mason do to Amber? Is he so lost in the world since the death of his mother that he can no longer determine what are memories and what is imagination?

 Spiral had somewhat of the same premise as He Was A Quiet Man starring Christian Slater; the same office worker, loner guy who's about to lose it any minute.

3282922,3,B0010AN7LS,"""Spiral"" doesn't seem to know what kind of film it wants to be.  Horror?  Psychological thriller?  A relationship film?  A commentary about misfits?  The unfolding of this story of socially inept Mason and the girl he hopes will ""be the one"" is slow and deliberate, with some scenes between them painfully awkward.  There are undercurrents of madness, obsession, and psychological torment, although these all have a vagueness that never sharpens into the horror suggested by the film's trailer.

Despite the flaws, ""Spiral"" remains an interesting film.  Joel David Moore seems to get inside Mason's skin, although he overdoes Mason's tortured personality so it hardly seems believable that he hangs out with the people he does.  Amber Tamblyn is thoroughly likeable as . . . Amber, but the chemistry between her and Moore never quites succeeds.  The cinematography is adept, with its hues of orange and red, and the use of rain.

The extras offer nothing special (except the trailer, which is interesting only because it splices all the tense moments into a minute that perhaps bests the film itself).

This film is a decent way to spend an evening, but I don't recommend going out of your way to see it.",1205884800,14,1204,4.935323383084577

It's a movie that seems to have a very simple surface story but reveals at the end to have been a much more complex story than you imagined. It twists once and then again at the end for a satisfying yet disturbing ending. At the end, you're left with questions that you think you might discover the answer to if you watched it just one more time.

Spiral tells the story of Mason, a quiet, nerdy guy who has never been to the movies and who spends all his free time sketching, painting, and listening to old jazz. He has frequent panic attacks which are linked to memories from his past. He doesn't seem to have any friends except an old friend from high school that hires him as a telemarketer and who seems to be the only one who understands his panic attacks. However, this changes one day when an outgoing new telemarketer named Amber befriends him at lunch. Mason doesn't say much, but Amber persists. Eventually, she convinces Mason to paint her ... and Mason seems to become more and more normal until Amber stumbles upon something that alerts her to just how psychologically bothered Mason really is.

To say more about the plot would be to ruin the movie. But I insist that this is not just a movie about life as a telemarketer or about how a quiet guy is brought out of his shell by a girl. It's a disturbing story about letting ourselves believe what we want to believe. It's a story of illusions. And the movie plot is more brilliant the more you think about it.",1205884800,,2442,5.856741573033708
3282924,4,B0010AN7LS,"Joel David Moore (Hatchet, Grandma's Boy) plays Mason, a Jazz loving telemarketer who paints by night and is plagued with a deep, dark secret and occasional asthma attacks. His only friend is his womanizing boss, Berkeley, who takes care of Mason in his own, somewhat domineering way. That is until Mason meets Amber (Amber Tamblyn), an adorable (though sometimes overly so) girl who works in the same building and is also in need of a friend. Through Amber's persistence, she and Mason soon become friends and more, but it's only a matter of time before Mason's dark issues must come to the forefront.

Skillfully and deceptively marketed as some sort of terrifying slasher film through a very misleading trailer, ""Spiral"" is actually an extremely satisfying, even Hitchcockian suspense-romance, wonderfully played out with superb performances and great jazz music. It's not quite perfect. I would have liked a bit more information about the characters to be revealed, and I wasn't totally comfortable with the non-jazz music in the end, but I think that was more about the chosen piece itself.  Yet, it is well worth seeing and even owning. Just don't expect an outright horror film like the trailer, included as an extra, would have you believe. Other extras are a ""making of"" (it's really just random behind the scenes footage),  three brief Starz promotional looks at the making, and a great commentary with co-director Adam Green and stars Joel David Moore (who is also co-director and co-writer), Amber Tamblyn, and Zachary Levi, plus co-writer/producer Jeremy Boreing and director of photography Will Barrett. The commentary is loaded with info and a fun group feel. Love the moments when the guys get excited every time they see one adorable extra.

3282925,4,B0010AN7LS,"I was definitely surprised by the quality of this indie film, based on the product description I have to confess I expected something very different so it really was a pleasant surprise. Something worth mentioning is that this is more of a psychological-terror film, so do not be deceived by the label ""Terror"". To give you an idea this movie is in the same line as `Fight Club' and `The Machinist', my intention is not to compare the movies but to give you an idea of what to expect.

Cinematography (as other reviewers have mentioned) is great, Joel David Moore is excellent as Mason, Amber Tamblyn's acting is ok but nothing great; to me, Moore's portrayal of Mason is what steals the film. Without giving any details to reveal the plot, the movie captured me from the very beginning, there are some disturbing sequences that do not reveal anything but have you wanting to know or guess what the main character's past is. Something I liked is the camera movement every time Mason wasn't feeling ok, the movement captured the moment and gave the sense of instability the character was feeling.

The movie does leave loose ends but in a good sense, rather than giving away all the info they leave you thinking about those unsolved pieces of the puzzle (what was the last pose? What was behind that door?) The film may feel a little slow at first but it is indeed setting all the pieces in place to surprise you with a nice twist at the end; I thought I had seen it coming when I watched it and then, another twist!

Another thing to note is the soundtrack, they accommodated all that jazz in the right places at the right times.

The DVD contains the trailer and some `making of' documentaries that explain how this indie film was made, Dolby Surround 2.0 and 5.1 and no subtitles (it is closed captioned though)

A great film indeed, I found it better than many big budget films I've seen recently; give this entertaining piece the chance and watch it, if you like this type of psychological thrillers you won't be disappointed.",1205712000,,2030,4.596685082872928
3282926,2,B0010AN7LS,"The story sounded interesting and I love Hitchcock fliks so I looked forward to watching this. The first 45 minutes were literal torture, it was SO BORING. Yes I understand, they were ""building"" the story but there was nothing to really draw you in. The actor who played the main character ""Mason"" was fantastic but the whole story just was not very believable and very slow moving - not by any fault of the actors - the script definately needs work. Amber Tamblin was great as well but again, you would never believe that she was interested in Mason. He was freaky looking and obviously had massive emotional problems, what from you ask? Well we'd all love to know more history on Mason but very little was provided - flashbacks would have worked nicely in this film or even begining the story when Mason was younger and flashing forward. Regardless, this movie could have been much better. The second half of the movie was definitely more entertaining and suspensfull but I couldn't watch this movie again and if I hadn't committed to reviewing this for vine I would have given up on it a lot earlier. If you watch Spiral do check out the ""Making of"" it's the most interesting part.",1205712000,,1184,4.61611374407583
3282927,3,B0010AN7LS,"So this one tells of a strange, ill-fitting romance. It's also a claustrophobic psychological thriller, taking place in a dreary and drizzly Portland. Mason is the creepy, asthmatic insurance telemarketer who leads a lonely, solitary life. And, as per norm with tightly wound up, deeply disturbed recluses, he holds in some seriously pent up stuff. His art and his jazz collection are seemingly his only means of release and source of comfort. It's curious, though, that Mason is always sketching his subjects in the same poses (it makes you go, ""Hmmm...). His sole means to companionship lies in his mysoginist boss, Berkeley (Zachary Levi), with whom he shares an addled friendship. From the start, we're aware that Mason has been having recurring nightmares concerning a bathroom door and a girl who might or might not have been brutally murdered.

But then his sunny and offbeat co-worker Amber (Amber Tamblyn) takes an interest in him. In Amber's effervescent presence Mason finally relaxes enough to let his guard down. But, maybe, just maybe, it would've been better if Mason had been left alone. Because this isn't a typical love story. As Mason becomes more comfortable in his own skin, this leaves the way open to something dark which has always skulked just beneath his neuroses.

SPIRAL is one of those quietly unsettling films which you can't really sit thru without feeling squirmy. Even in the early stages, when the story is basically a character study, a sense of discomfort is fostered, brought about mostly by a focusing on Mason's off-kiltered and fairly effed-up private world. About two-thirds of SPIRAL is locked into the evolution of Mason and Amber's uneasy relationship, as well as tidbits here and there of Mason and Berkeley interacting. Gradually, the film takes on a noirish texture; a sense of ugliness and a horrific anticipation creep up as we learn potentially frightening things about our guy.

I wasn't sure if the languid pace would be able to keep my eyeballs glued to the screen. But, it turns out, the film drops enough points of interest and jumpy moments to maintain my backpocket in a parked position. While I wasn't predisposed to liking Mason, I couldn't help but be fascinated by (and leery of) him, so I hung around to see what makes him tick.  Mason is a painful character to watch, confounded as he is by his inner demons. Joel David Moore plays Mason, and he not only takes on the lead role but also co-writes and co-directs this low-budgeted indie. Acting wise, Moore is solid, even if his character isn't so sympathetic (he's a bit too creepy for that). Yet you still feel a bit for the poor, awkward bastard.

I picked up SPIRAL mostly because of Zachary Levi, who's simply tremendous in his nerdy leading man role in CHUCK. I'll tell you what, Levi's Berkeley is pretty far removed from his Chuck Bartowski. That's some decent acting range. I think what makes Berkeley an appealing character - despite his boorish, womanizing nature - is his constant loyalty to his social misfit of a buddy. Amber Tamblyn, who was so good in JOAN OF ARCADIA and so forgettable in THE GRUDGE 2, shows off her stuff as Mason's warm and bubbly friend and then girlfriend. Watch Amber subtly work in her expressions, as her character, in turns, becomes drawn to, perplexed by, and, finally, increasingly nervous of the new dude in her life. Amber's good. I still miss JOAN OF ARCADIA.

An aside now: for fans of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, there's a miniscule sighting of Tricia Helfer. She's in several minutes of a Christmas dinner scene, looking good in a sexy red thing. But then she's gone.

I like that not everything is spelled out. What's up with the postcards? Did the movie ever unveil the final page that Mason ripped out in his sketchbook? I don't recall seeing it. His troubled childhood is hinted at but never probed in detail. And what's the story behind Mason and Berkeley's longstanding but odd-duck friendship? Things to perhaps fleetingly ponder, post-viewing. There are two twists in the film's final segment, one of which is a revelation dropped by Berkeley. But, once the film was over, I couldn't help but re-evaluate Berkeley's assertion, and if it had any merit at all.

Bonus features time. The disc has an easy-going audio commentary by the filmmakers, including Joel David Moore, Amber Tamblyn and Zachary Levi (they're a fun-loving bunch). There's also ""Spinning Spiral: The Making Of SPIRAL"" - a negligible if breezy seven minutes of on-camera tomfoolery by cast and crew. This segment doesn't really offer much insight into the film itself. Insignificantly, there are also promos and the trailer. Basically, if you liked the film, I recommend checking out the much relaxed audio commentary (where it's learned that SPIRAL started out as a short film).

Three stars for this one. I mostly enjoyed it. But, yes, it dragged, at times.",1205625600,,4890,4.903264812575574
3282928,2,B0010AN7LS,"Poor Amber Tamblyn, since the unceremonious cancellation of Joan of Arcadia, she has been slumming it in movies about pants, bad Japanese remakes, straight to DVD flicks,  Hallmark movies and failed zombie shows.  Her latest step into obscurity is with another straight to DVD outing, the psychological thriller Spriral where she plays the most interesting character.  Although Zach Levi gives her a run for her money, even though with the short hair and beard looks more like Jesse Metcalf than Chuck Bartowski.

But the movie belongs to Joel David Moore (Hatchet) in every sense of the word as besides being the main character he also co-directed and co-wrote the movie.  So when he is what brings down the movie, you only have him to blame because whether you blame him, how it was written, or directed, in the end it all fall on him.

Moore plays you token introvert working as a telemarketer under the eyes of Levi who has looked after him since high school and has been his only friend throughout that time.  Not that Levi is the most nurturing friend who thinks being there and telling him the truths are enough.  But Moore starts to turn around when he meets the carefree Tamblyn.
The big twist at the end of the movie makes things interesting, but once the twist is reveled, it is easy to predict a second twist, which turns out to be one too many.  And as much Tamblyn and Levi are on throughout the movie, Moore just suck the life out of the film even with the cool jazz soundtrack.",1205625600,,1493,4.582706766917293
3282929,3,B0010AN7LS,"SPIRAL is an easy to follow, entertaining psychological thriller.  Joel David Moore is quite good playing Mason and he makes this awkward artist with obvious problems sympathetic and believable. Zachary Levi plays Berkeley, Mason's self-confident boss at a telemarketing office who inexplicably protects Mason both in the workplace and life.  And sweet faced Amber Tamblyn is Mason's ""dream girl"" conveniently also named Amber.  Two major elements in the premise of the story strain credibility.  Though we are told Berkely and Mason are lifelong friends and the script more than hints at Mason's tragic family past there is nothing we are shown in Berkely's ambitious selfish personality that really explains why he is such a loyal, protective friend to Mason.  The other unbelievable element concerns Mason's relationship with  Amber.  Though Amber is portrayed as a bit quirky herself she seems too attractive and articulate to be the initiator in a romantic relationship with troubled Mason.

Two twists are revealed in the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. One of the twists  surprised me and the other did not.  The storyline is coherent and the filmmakers are wise in leaving a few unanswered questions for the viewer to think about instead of over explaining everything.  The well realized setting of Portland, Oregon in early winter is a bit different and adds realism and interest to the film as does the original jazz music that makes up most of the soundtrack.  This film is no classic but it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half either.",1205452800,,1562,4.988416988416988
3282930,5,B0010AN7LS,"From the very beginning of the movie, two things are clear.

First, this isn't some big-budget Hollywood thriller whose high-profile casting and slick production values are meant to lure you into believing the film is markedly better than it actually is.

And secondly, despite being a low budget movie, that this is indeed a well made film that grabs your attention right away and promises to be a compelling tale. And for me personally, this movie pays off on its promises quite well.

This is the story of Mason (portrayed brilliantly by co-writer and co-director Joel David Moore), a withdrawn and clearly disturbed man who has many problems, including severe asthma, and a past that seems to haunt his every day life. From the very first scene we're led to believe that he's done something terrible involving a woman whose portrait he has drawn or painted several times, and fills his apartment. Without going too deeply into the plot (which other reviews have already explored, I'm sure), suffice it to say that over time, Mason meets and begins to fall in love with a new woman, Amber Tamblyn, whom then becomes the new object of his obsession.

What I like about this story is that it seems to intentionally avoid turning into one of the gory, slasher, blood-bath movies that seem to be all the rage these days. I think the comparisons with Hitchcocking horror are a bit stretched, but it's not completely irrelevant either. This is a psychological horror tale that explores the human frailties and the desperate need for acceptance that most of us face on some level each day. Both the lead character, Mason, and his new girlfriend Amber seem to both be looking for that special someone who will fill out the missing parts and make them whole. The fact that they find each other, and that for a while you really begin to hope and pray that this ends in the proverbial ""And They Lived Happily Ever After"" is a direct testament to the acting of Moore and Tamblyn.

The movie's plot isn't the greatest, but frankly, it's a simple movie and a simple tale, and I think it's the perfect vehicle in which the actors themselves should be allowed to carry the movie, which they did to great effect. And given the fact that this is a horror movie and are fairly certain that a happy ending just isn't in the cards, it's hard to expect a film like this to have a new and innovative ending. And yet, I have to admit that the twist that ensues did in fact surprise me and left me feeling sad. The movie treats Mason as a flawed human being who is worthy of compassion, rather than the mindless monster of a man without a soul that populates most horror stories today, and I found that, and the lack of copious amounts of fake blood splattering the screen, to be quite refreshing.

The movie is not perfect, but in my opinion nothing ever is anyway. But what it is is a very well done, straightforward, psychological horror of a man for who you expect the worst from, but find yourself hoping for the best for. And as a writer who fancies himself merely an old-fashioned storyteller, this is one of the better told stories I've seen in a while.

There is a corridor in his apartment which seems to be hiding a secret. It beckons to Mason at times but he avoids it. There are deep emotional scars hidden within Mason's mind which gradually become evident as he listens to jazz and engages in sketching. His mind wanders to either dreams or real events which haunt him. The story unfolds gradually, revealing details about Mason's lonely existence, as he washes his soiled hands of what could be blood or red paint. Despite Mason's peculiar quiet withdrawn behavior he is protected by his boss when Mason arrives late to work. Berkley, his boss, knows Mason's history. Berkley goes out of his way to include Mason in activties, such as shooting basketball and also a Christmas dinner. Berkley is a bit arrogant and a ladies man, a handsome macho guy who is secure in his job and of his ability to win over women.

Mason packs a brown bag lunch daily and often eats it outside on a bench. There he meets a new employee Amber, who notices Mason's sketches of a pretty lady about which he is rather secretive. Mason is withdrawn but gradually befriends the vivacious and perky Amber who shows interest in him. She goes out of her way to sit with him at lunch and walk him home under her umbrella during a rainy day. She invents ways to meet him and eventually they date. She is invited to his bachelor's apartment and becomes a model for him to paint. Mason takes a bus ride to a cemetery where he visits the grave of his mother, where nearby, a young boy is attending a funeral but breaks away and goes behind a tree to cry ... alone ... the situation is very eery. Somehow it becomes symbolic of Mason's own life.

As Amber continues sitting and posing for Mason, she becomes more and more emotionally involved and one day, they make love. She also becomes more curious about his love of jazz and the sketches he has done . He invites her to his apartment again. The viewer then discovers the sinister secrets which Mason has been hiding. This film is superbly done and totally involves the viewer in the convoluted mind and twisted feelings of Mason as the truth behind his quietness and hidden behavior is revealed.

Mason's only real friend is his boss (Zachary Levi), until he is befriended by a slightly off-kilter woman (Amber Tamblyn (whose father Russ also has a cameo in the film) who shares his loneliness. The film is slow-paced, which might drive some people away but will only draw others in further. There are also loose ends which go unresolved (what is up with Mason's parents, for example?). The cinematography is impressive as well as the dreary, rainy locale jazz-inspired score, which gives this modern movie a film noir feel. ""Spiral"" is also slightly reminiscent of the disturbed loner films of Roman Polanski (""Tenant"" for example); while not ever rising to that level of cinematic art, it does portray the lead character in a similar way, where fantasy and reality intersect and overlap, leaving the viewer to guess which one is which.

 First, we have to deal with the whole aspect of a picture with a ""twist"" ending. No that's not a spoiler, films like this always have a twist ending. But that's the problem! Just knowing there is one can, if you're into films like this, give the ending away! As an old-time fan of weird flicks I, and quite a few of my friends, figured out the ""twist"" of ""The Sixth Sense"" once we knew there was one. Sure the first reviewers were stunned, but we knew immediately that either A) Willis was dead B) the kid was dead or C) they both were. Then it was only an exercise in seeing how well it was done. Conversely, none of us quite figured out the twist of ""The Usual Suspects"" if only because it was so arbitrary. While ""Spiral"" is nowhere near as good as the two films above, it is well made, has some very clever (and not unfunny) dialogue and a twist that, while not on a par with ""Sixth Sense"" is certainly more earned than ""Suspects"". PLUS it has Amber Tamblyn and that means it is worth seeing. And it has a pre-Chuck Zachary Levi who's always interesting. In short, it's a pretty good example of the kind of B movie suspense film they not only DO still make, they make a lot worse than this one.

3282935,3,B0010AN7LS,"Seems like one of the new go-to themes in movies is the nerdy guy in the cubicle who just might be a dangerous psychotic.  Before long, we might have to change ""going postal"" to ""going cubicle.""  Well, here's another one.  Joel David Moore stars/co-writes/co-directs this tale of Mason, an insurance telemarketer by day/painter by night who is in contention for the Most Socially Awkward Man title (introvert division).  Mason has frequent episodes in which he awakes from a fitful sleep with the panicked impression that he just might have killed a girl who was modeling for his painting.  He immediately calls his boyhood pal and current boss, Berkeley (Zachary Levi), who calms him down and assures him to take his meds and everything will be fine.

After a while, Mason meets Amber (Amber Tamblyn), a fellow brown-bag lunch type at their generic company.  Amber doggedly ignores the veritable neon sign flashing ""Creepy"" and ""Awkward"" intermittently, for reasons that are essentially plot driven and unapparent to the audience.  Eventually, she notices Mason's sketchbook, which reinforces her determination to repress the natural inclination to shudder and back away very slowly from this dude.  And yes, she will be Mason's next model and muse.

There are plenty of options from that set up.  Maybe it's a special edition of Beauty and the Geek, in which a beautiful and bubbly girl can see through the total absence of available personality and save the tortured, sensitive and inwardly beautiful geek.  Maybe it's A Beautiful Mind, set to painting instead of math.  Maybe there really is a slasher in there.  Or perhaps a combo plate of some of the above with other stuff they've whipped up here.  Or maybe something else altogether, and they're messing with us to throw everyone off track.

The acting is excellent - Mason is believably twitchy, tortured and weird.  Amber is adorable, sweet and quirky, albeit not really quirky enough to justify such an interest in Mason.  Berkeley is fine as a one-note insensitive cad who apparently grew fond of Mason before losing all other human emotions.  The dialogue is problematic, however.  The interplay between Mason and Amber just doesn't ring true for the first half of the movie, and the transitions in their relationship are somewhat leaden.  The twists-and-turns promised by all the promotional references to Hitchcock provide variable levels of satisfaction, and it should be noted that at least one of them is adapted from other, better films.

3282936,3,B0010AN7LS,"I found myself quite engrossed in this movie.  In a way I was surprised, having expected a more typical horror flick.  Instead, ""Spiral"" is a very effective blend of brooding drama and slow-building suspense.

The basic storyline concerns an athsmatic 30ish call center drone named Mason (Joel David Moore). He is socially awkward and obviously psychologically troubled in some way.  Early on, we see Mason making what apparently is a fairly regular middle-of-the-night phone call to his boss Berkeley (Zachary Levi), having awoken suddenly from a nightmare. Berkeley is a patient employer who has an interesting friendship (of sorts) with Mason. Through their conversations we learn bits and pieces about Mason's past.

What seems to keep him going are his twin passions: painting and jazz music.  He is an active participant in the former, and a devout fan of the latter. He began his painting hobby by recreating classic jazz album covers, and now seems to exclusively concentrate on the female form. He has many notebooks of sketches, each one labelled with a different female name.

Mason's worldview seems to improve slowly upon meeting a young woman named Amber (Amber Tamblyn).  The two develop a friendship that starts with stilted lunch-break conversation, blossoming over time to something much deeper.  Amber finds Mason intriguing - she responds to his 'tortured artist' vibe.  Mason responds to her openmindedness (and attractiveness).  She quickly becomes the subject of his latest series of paintings. Giving away more would be dirty pool. Suffice it to say, Mason's mental instability becomes a serious detriment to his new relationship.

The acting by the principles is very good.  Joel David Moore manages to infuse Mason with just enough humanity to keep him sympathetic.  Amber Tamblyn is extremely likeable as Amber.  Zachery Levi gives Berkeley an unusual mix of corporate jerk (when he's at work) and nuturing big brother (in his scenes with Mason).

Whether or not you'll see where this is all heading probably depends, in part, on how many movies you've seen.  I am usually horrible at figuring out how suspense movies will end, so it should be taken with a grain of salt that I managed to have a pretty good idea prior to the credits rolling.  That shouldn't be a deterrent, however, from checking out this movie.

This is NOT a movie worth purchasing...if you must see it, please rent it.  My best advice is don't spend vaulable time on it at all.

Without giving anything away - I didn't understand why a string of (apparently) a dozen or so pretty girls found themselves romantically drawn to the main character.

His boss - buddy - defender at least hinted that they were somehow high-school classmates.  This kind of explains his connection - but does not satisfactorally tell us why he feels so protective.

When the boss broke up with his girl-friend...non other than Tricia Helfer from Battlestar Galactica...he lost all cred with me!  ;)  If she wasn't in this movie - I would have made this a 2-star review.",1204675200,3,667,4.807017543859649
8237570,2,B0010AN7LS,"This is an imperfect-but-creditable movie. Living in Portland, Oregon, Mason (Joel Moore) is a gifted artist, but also a neurotic and reclusive asthmatic, living a life of anonymity, working from a drab cubicle in a call center, repeating the same meaningless conversation with faceless strangers ad nauseam. His boss, Berkeley (Zachary Levi), is not quite a friend, but his sole source of companionship in an otherwise isolated existence. That is, until he meets a gregarious co-worker named Amber (Amber Tamblyn).",1506729600,,515,5.45
8237571,5,B0010AN7LS,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky indie films.  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

I've also been a lifelong fan of the horror/thriller genre.  So this psychological thriller was like the perfect marriage of everything I'm into.  Fan of co-director Adam Green and I think this is my favorite thing he's done.  Related to the main introverted guy a little bit, mostly just from both of us being introverted, though not so much the...other tendencies (though someone like him would say that, haha.  Just trying not to spoil anything).  Agreed that it could be seen as unrealistic that Amber Tamblyn's character would be that interested in pursuing him, but I'm just going by my own life experience.  I've also heard some girls are into ""the chase"" of guys who act distant and cold toward them or don't seem too into them (like your typical sex crazed guy) or the girls are just drawn to artistic types different from the ""norm"".  Also, just because someone is attractive and seems ""normal"" (the types of people I'm actually most suspicious of), you have no idea what's going on in their head.  Not sure why people seem to find that so hard to understand.  Everyone's messed up in their own way and dealing with their own issues.  So who knows what attracts us to certain types of people?  We like who we like :)  So I guess its possible and I'm just envious, haha.

His boss may have hung out with him because I think they were childhood friends (and helped him get the job, right?).  Otherwise, yeah, I wouldn't see what the attraction would be for either one to the other, since I tend to be repelled by ""Type A"" people like the boss and his other co-workers in real life.  Lots of people like that where I live and I've had my share of negative workplace experiences with them - job was killing my soul and I was lucky to get out while I could, especially considering who's ""President"" now.  Though to be fair they're probably equally as repelled by people like me.  Just one of those things I've had to learn to live with.  Love how the boss stuck up for him, though, to the boss' girlfriend.  That part made me envious, too lol  And it also made the boss a complex character, his relationship to the introverted character (sorry, I'm bad with names), the fact that he genuinely seemed to care for him and want to help him, or else he would have just been a boring ""Type A"" character cliche like some of the other co-workers.  Also loved the twist at the end.

Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  Give this ""dark version of Napoleon Dynamite"" a go.

8237572,3,B0010AN7LS,"I went very middle of the road on this movie. Really I go 2.5 on it and I believe I am being generous. I am by no means a genius but I'm not a dummy either. Therefore, I have to say that I simply did not get it! I like odd movies and the like, I like odd characters too. but I seriously did not understand what was going on and why. therefore after watching the entire thing.....I say don't do it. I do like Joel David Moore but I got nothing from him at all and seeing as how he seems to be disturbed.....why buddy up to him? By my admission of not getting it, I will not say that it is amazing or wonderful just to appear intellectual at all. I like what I like and what I don't I don't. have a pleasant day.",1492300800,,710,3.836734693877551

Adam Green has done some great dumb horror (Hatchet) and some lousy dumb horror (Digging Up the Marrow) but this one is a subtle, thoughtful piece of work that demonstrates the value of indie horror to the film industry.
