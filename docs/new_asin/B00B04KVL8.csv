8559991,4,B00B04KVL8,"I really like this workout.  It is especially great at strengthening the upper body (shoulders and back), which a lot of workouts miss or minimize.  If you don't want to do this as a full 1 hour workout, she does do it in segments, starting with upper body, then full body Pilates/yoga, and then lower body and abs.  So you could pretty easily split it into 2 or even three workouts.

The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because there is no explanation on how to adjust the moves and poses if you can't do them.  I'm not a beginner, but I'm not as flexible or advanced as the trainer is.  There should be some modifications available.  I could figure out how to modify most of the moves, but not all of them.

That said, I injured my shoulder years ago and really need to strengthen it back up.  I did not feel like this would cause any problems, and I think it will really help in the long run.

You will want a workout mat, light weights (do not go too heavy for those arm workouts!), and a yoga ball.",1436054400,3,1012,4.196891191709844

I like her attitude, which is not obnoxious as some trainers tend to be... I can relate to her and her instructions are always very clear.

As there are 2 different workouts (that can be combined if you have time, I usually don't) on her S3 DVD and 3 different workouts on her Weight Loss DVD  (that can be combined if you have time, again I usually don't), I can do five days of different workouts without ever getting too repetitive. You'll need just a mat for Weight Loss DVD, but you'll also need light weights for S3 DVD.

While searching Kristen's name to see if her new title was out yet (the new title is ""Yoga Slim"", which is still not available on Amazon as of May 2013), I came across this DVD. Interestingly I have blood type A as well and since I like Kristen's style, I ordered it.

I don't know why Kristen doesn't mention/promote this DVD on her website as it provides a great workout. I guess these Blood Type Workout DVDs also promote a kit:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Type-Workout-Kit-Medium/dp/B007Z5MVX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Type Workout Kit, Medium</a>. However, to go through Kristen's ""Type A"" DVD, I already had everything at home. Basically, aside from a mat to work on, you'll need light weights (how many pounds will depend on your fitness level), resistance tubing (which you can find easily online and/or department stores) and finally a resistance ball (which you can also find easily online and/or department stores).

In summary, if you can motivate yourself to workout at home (which was a bit hard for me at first) and if you have an hour to workout, this is a great DVD and is probably at intermediate level. I started to use it like on a weekend, in the weekdays I prefer the shorter routines on the DVDs I mentioned previously. Using items like resistance ball, resistance tubing, etc. keeps it a fun and interesting workout.

In the DVD, there is a warm-up around 5min. and then 3 sessions (toning with weights, yoga, pilates with resistance ball/tubing) that are each around 20min. I guess these could be divided into 3 and done on different days to save time, but since they are so different, I prefer to do them back to back. the DVD ends with ffinal stretching (cool-down) which is again around 5min.

I don't know if this DVD should be preferred by only people with blood Type A , because it seems like a good overall workout no matter what, but since I have blood Type A, it doesn't make a difference to me.

I've been a long-time member of Amazon and Kristen McGee is the only reason I actually set down to write a review. Maybe that may prove how much I enjoy her routines. I'll probably only buy her pilates/yoga DVDs from now on for workout purposes. I'm definitely a devoted fan as her routines put me in best shape I've ever been in my life.",1368144000,13,3374,5.235185185185185
