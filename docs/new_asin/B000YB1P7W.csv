3025574,3,B000YB1P7W,"We had a very early DVD of burning fireplaces which had the noise of crackling wood, a roaring fire that slowly would die down and give you the feel of our old fireplace.  This one has music, which we mute and is just a loop of a roaring fire.  It works as background, but we keep hoping to find a copy of our original disc.

Decent disc if you want a neutral moving video on the wall, but it does not have the effect of a real fireplace, with the roaring fire that dies down.",1392163200,,476,3.9894736842105263

3025576,5,B000YB1P7W,"This is simply wonderful! It's a great gift idea for anyone, It really helps you to relax and adds a beauty to any room in the house with a television. This is excellent. I will order ones for my friends and loved ones.",1388793600,,219,4.116279069767442

3025578,2,B000YB1P7W,"Its basically a loop of 10 minutes or so.  So it's alright, but doesn't show a good full burn like a virtual fireplace should.

Who are they kidding, we know what fires are meant to look like.",1361836800,4,192,4.162162162162162

3025580,5,B000YB1P7W,"As an apartment dweller with no fireplace, I bought this to bring a little ""warmth"" visually into my living room, as a background.  I also thought it was kind of funny to have a fireplace on TV.  But now, I absolutely *love* this dvd because as I listened to the music and did whatever around the house, I found myself really enjoying it!  The music is designed for deep relaxation (not sleeping, but a sort-of active relaxation, for lack of a better phrase) and the visual warmth of a fireplace really adds to the ambience of my otherwise white walls.  I really love this now.  I am considering getting another for the inevitablity of this one's eventual demise! lol  It's great!:-)",1347494400,3,683,4.603305785123967

8231684,5,B000YB1P7W,"Some days here in Phoenix, we no burn days because of bad air. But x-mas time with the sound up, plus afterward I can fall asleep in my recliner.  The snap, crackle, and pop make great Christmas gifts where there is no winter per=say. There is no snow in down=town Phoenix where I live. I've also purchased ""Fireplace for your Home"" for myself.",1483920000,,344,4.4603174603174605
8231685,5,B000YB1P7W,It's just like having a real fireplace in your home without all the mess! All the sounds & looks of a real fire!,1477008000,,112,3.9130434782608696
8231686,5,B000YB1P7W,"Godfather Part II, Terminator 2, Radient Fireplace 2...not necessarily in that order.  Sequels are never better than the original, but this is a rare exception to that rule. This movie has everything...excitement, drama, and a surprise cameo you never see coming! I highly recommend Radient Fireplace 2, even if you have not seen the original!!!",1468627200,,345,5.2727272727272725
8231687,5,B000YB1P7W,"We use this DVD through the winter months in our office. Every patient that comes in remarks on it.
Half of them are confused that its just a dvd.
I've probably referred 5 or more people to Amazon to pick up their copy.
It makes everything feel warm and cozy.",1450396800,,259,4.2
8231688,5,B000YB1P7W,I have used this DVD for 8yrs and the fire looks so amazing and sounds great. Everyone compliments it when they come over and some people say they actually feel warm looking at it. I wish the creators of this DVD would re-do it on blue-ray to make I the ultimate fireplace!!,1449532800,,274,4.288461538461538
8231689,4,B000YB1P7W,"The silent version and the crackling fire sounds version are wonderful complements to the visual burning fire.  The ""soft soothing"" music is rather annoying.  Wish that music was more melodic!",1447459200,,192,5.366666666666666

8231692,5,B000YB1P7W,"It transforms a room into a cozy and warm place complete with crackling noises; do not have to have any music playing as I like
to read in my comfy chair with a nice warm cup of cocoa....the real thing without all the fuss and mess.  Would highly recommend
to anyone who likes but does not have a warm hearth.  So cheap you can buy for all your friends!",1414022400,,353,4.101449275362318
8231693,5,B000YB1P7W,"Perfect for winter nights in with a book and some wine. Also great for house parties! I know my guests enjoyed it even though they might have found humor in it haha I honestly don't like the music in this, I just use the ""natural sounds"" and that's all I need.",1407456000,,260,4.117647058823529
