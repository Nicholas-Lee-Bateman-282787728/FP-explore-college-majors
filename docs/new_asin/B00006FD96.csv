1745195,4,B00006FD96,"I bought this on a whim, and I really liked it.  It's got an intricate, surprise-laden plot that kept me guessing.  Sutherland plays an assassin, Banks, on what he hopes is one last job, and unbeknownst to him, he's being pursued and set up by the FBI.  Part of the film is told in flashbacks, with an ever-widening perspective as we get to know the characters.  The thing is, you really want to like Banks because when he lets his guard down, he's intelligent, kind of shy, and funny.  And then you have to remind yourself that he's a paid killer.

During the course of the film, Banks picks up a down and out hitchhiker, Bennie, with whom he is by turns brutal and sensitive, to help him complete the hit.  (She reminds me of a younger Glenne Headley from the movie Dick Tracy).  They make a good pair, because you don't really trust either one of them.  I found myself torn between rooting for the ""good"" guys, and rooting for Banks.

This is just a fun, funny, kind of violent movie that is enjoyable to watch.  I recommend it.",1263945600,2,1031,4.373684210526315
1745196,4,B00006FD96,"Smart enough to have seen it once on cable and rented it afterwards. The writing and the lead performances are smart and natural. Not entirely persuaded by the very last twist - of two - though, as if director Richard Greenberg had had second thoughts of an already fair resolution.

Reminds me of director Carl Colpaert's 'Delusion' (1991), starring Jim Metzler and Jennifer Rubin. An accountant (Metzler) drives through the Nevada desert after having embezzled his underworld bosses; he helps out attractive girl (Rubin) and her boyfriend (Kyle Secor), a couple whose car has broken down in the middle of nowhere. The accountant is unaware that Secor, who'll figure out his scam, is a professional killer. Although he'll live to regret both his ill deed and his humanitarian gesture, will turn out more resourceful than any of his mobster adversaries - and get to keep the girl, too. Jerry Orbach makes a memorable turn. Why this thoroughly enjoyable surprise of a movie is out only on VHS still, I'll never know.",1220227200,,1015,4.935672514619883
1745197,4,B00006FD96,"Desert Saints brings to the screen the story of a hit man who teams up with a young woman in order to drive down to Mexico and assassinate a Mexican politician who is waging war on the drug cartels. All the while the FBI is after them.  It's going to be a bumpy, and yet interesting ride indeed...

The major setback is in relation to the supporting cast who are not that great!

Kiefer Sutherland does a great job on his own in trying to keep this film afloat, and his performance is AMAZING!

In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.",1154995200,3,636,4.319327731092437
1745198,4,B00006FD96,"Even though Kiefer Sutherland turns in yet another standard Kiefer Sutherland performance (although somewhat less annoying than in 24), the inventive and surprising script combined with the superior way Melora Walters shapes her pivotal role make for an extremely entertaining and nailbiting, grossly underrated movie, which should by all standards have had a theatrical release. Melora Walters is the centrepiece of the movie, and she carries it off sublimely, switching her performance on demand from irritating to extremely competent and forceful. A definite must-see for the film noir fan !",1140998400,,594,5.611111111111111
1745199,4,B00006FD96,I really liked this movie and watched it in the first place cos i'm a fan of kiefer sutherland. I liked the way Banks got his own back in the end as well. I didn't give it a 5 star rating because i couldn't help finding Bennie quite annoying at times.,1090800000,2,251,3.9411764705882355

1745203,4,B00006FD96,"Desert Saints is a surprisingly good 'hitman with a twist' tale by first time writer/director Richard Greenberg. He takes the standard 'assassin's last hit' formula, and shakes it up by introducing FBI agents with their own agendas, a 'plant' who may or may not be falling for the gunman, and, in Kiefer Sutherland, a hero/villain who is ruthless, sexy, and, ultimately, sympathetic. His performance is remarkable, and is matched by Melora Walters, as the latest of his string of doomed accomplices, who is keeping even more secrets than he is! She shows a remarkable range in her role, at times ditzy, at times mysterious and sexy, and, by the film's climax, intelligent and self-sufficient.
For an indie, the cast is first-rate all the way, with the always reliable Jamey Sheridan as a veteran FBI agent, as dedicated to his job as Sutherland is to his; Leslie Stefanson as Sheridan's second-in-command, and the wild card of the operation; and, in a very sexy cameo, Rachel Ticotin, who smolders as a waitress and occasional bedmate for Sutherland.
Greenberg cleverly uses flashbacks and flashforwards to lull the viewer into believing they know how the story will end, then springs a surprise that works extremely well, and will have you paying VERY close attention to detail during the last five minutes! While the ambiguous ending may disappoint some viewers, it offers a clever 'capper' to this tale of betrayal, and works for me!
If you are a fan of Sutherland, or stories with a twist and enough sensuality to raise your heartbeat a few notches, 'Desert Saints' is the film for you!",1037059200,26,1590,4.936567164179104

1745216,4,B00006FD96,"Desert Saints is not about holy men but people who commit criminal acts or act improperly, gangsters and cops. The main character is a hit man with some kind of psychological problem in the way he is careful. He seduces a woman or forces her to do all the things that could get him in trouble, such as buying the gun he will use to fulfill his contract to kill someone. But after the kill, he murders the woman; again to be careful so that she does not tell about him; and he hides the bodies for the same reason. Yet, strangely, he says he wants to leave his profession. The FBI knows who he is and wants to capture him in a way that allows them to get to the people who are hiring him. They place a woman where he is, who they hope he will take up - and he does - who will join him and tell them when it is time to pull him in and get the people they are really after. The woman does all she can to seduce him into revealing matters to him; but as usual, he is careful. The film has a surprise double ending.",1432166400,,1010,3.9317073170731707

1745219,4,B00006FD96,It was a decent movie but didn't contain the action I was expecting. Loving Kiefer helped me enjoy it but I was expecting more especially when one review stated it was the start of Jack Bauer. THAT'S NOT JACK!!!!!,1402531200,,213,4.487179487179487
1745220,2,B00006FD96,Weak story.  It never really captures your full attention.  Lead female character is annoying which is initially the point but even later is still irritating,1383436800,,157,5.24
1745221,5,B00006FD96,I have only seen Kiefer Sutherland in the 24 episodes so I wanted to see some of his other movies wasn't disappointed at all there was quite a bit of cussing in it but still a good movie,1374624000,2,186,3.9210526315789473

1745223,5,B00006FD96,"""Desert Saints"" is a clever ""who's doin' what to whom"" that will leave you guessing. Starring Keifer Sutherland and Melora Walters, the film features Leslie Stefanson, Jamey Sheridan, and Rachel Ticotin. In a different time and place, with a different director, this film might be been a first rate ""film noir."" Without that overall look, nonetheless, it makes a compelling, interesting, and provocative drama.

We know Kiefer Sutherland as Jack, the superhero from ""24"" who saves the U.S. every 12 months or so. Unfortunately, he is too much Jack in this film, and had he been a little more vulnerable, the film might have attained classic status. The film was made while ""24"" was being created, so it's understandable how Jack slipped over from the series into the film. Keifer plays a high priced assassin who typically enlists the help of a pathetic female and then kills her once his job is through.

Melora Walters is an actress whose face you'll recognize, but whose name escapes you. She's been in a few dozen films (""Magnolia"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""Melvin Goes to Dinner"", ""The Butterfly Effect"") as well as several TV shows (""Desperate Housewives"" as Sylvia Greene, ""Big Love"" as Wanda Henrickson). Walters plays an unsuspecting victim, or is she an FBI double agent? Or she in love with Keifer? Or???

Jamey Sheridan plays the FBI agent who has been after Sutherland for more than 10 years. Sheridan is a busy actor, best known for his TV roles as Captain Deakins in ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" (2003-6) and Dr. Joe Saviano in ""Trauma"" (2009-10).

Leslie Stefanson plays Sheridan's FBI partner who keeps wondering if Sheridan is ever tempted. Looking like a young Angelina Jolie before she butchered her lips, Stefanson has been in a dozen  films, best known for her role as Joan Kennedy in ""Jackie, Ethel, Joan"" (2001) and as ""The General's Daughter"" (1999) in the film of the same name.

Rachel Ticotin plays a waitress and a long time acquaintance of Sutherland. She co-starred with Paul Newman in ""Fort Apache: The Bronx"" (1981), with Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Total Recall"" (1990), and with Nic Cage in ""Con Air"" (1997). Personally I think her best performance was as the newspaper reporter in ""Man on Fire"" (2004).

This was writer/director Richard Greenberg's first film. He wrote/directed one later TV film, ""Strikeout"" (2009). Though this is a good job for a first timer, the script had great potential, and with a more experienced director, it could have ""been a contenda.""

The film's strengths are the story with its twists, the photography, the endless detail about life as a hitman, and the great performance by Melora Walters.

If you're a fan of action films, or hitman films, you definitely want to see this film. The fact that it could have been even better shouldn't dissuade you from watching it. I gave it a 5 because Amazon doesn't let me give it a 9 out of 10.",1275782400,2,2894,4.865853658536586
