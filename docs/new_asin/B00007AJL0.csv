8741404,4,B00007AJL0,"Pirates of the Plain centers around a nine-year-old boy (Seth Adkins) with an overactive imagination. Whether it's shoot-outs with the James Gang or laser battles with alien robots, little Bobby's playmates seem so real to him. It frightens his mother (Dee Wallace Stone), while Bobby's grandpa (Charles Napier) thinks it's just Bobby's way of coping with not having many friends and a father that left two years prior. At the same time that Bobby's story unfolds, a pirate captain in 1732 called Jezebel Jack (Tim Curry) has run afowl of his crew of cutthroats. Jezebel Jack has a map to a king's ransom worth of treasure but he wants it all for himself. After killing a man who knew the captain wasn't willing to share, Jack is thrown overboard by the rest of the pirates, and ends up in the wheat fields of Nebraska near Bobby's family's farm! As the two unlikely friends go on a treasure hunt for a strong-box of silver bars hidden by wild west outlaws, the disgruntled crew of Jack's ship, Delilah, also ends up ""sailing the amber waves of grain.""
John Cherry, of Ernest ""fame,"" acts as writor/director/producer of this family adventure film that will truly appeal not only to children but adults too. Tim Curry, as always, gives a great performance, while everyone has very well also. Good production values and a smartly written script makes this a worth-while buy to add to your pirate movie collection.",1051660800,10,1411,4.810699588477366
