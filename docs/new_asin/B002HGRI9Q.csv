8370331,5,B002HGRI9Q,"These releases by Kino DVD is eye opening perfect for the lover of retro, vintage and old-school reality. I laughed and roared with humor seeing these old films. Priceless product. Worth ever red cent. Hilarious and most of all a great trip into the past.",1433116800,,255,4.688888888888889
8370332,5,B002HGRI9Q,These are such a delightful commentary on how society has changed in the last 50+ years. They reminded me of the era I grew up in...definitely a more innocent time. Some make you laugh out loud. Remember those old movies they showed us in school when we were growing up?  Here they are.,1366156800,,286,4.39622641509434
8370333,4,B002HGRI9Q,Hilarious old educational films geared towards boys and young males. Great for anybody who appreciates the old 16mm school films!,1362960000,,129,5.5
8370334,4,B002HGRI9Q,"Educational videos from a long ago era.  This is the kind of thing you want to watch with a group of your most sarcastic, giggly friends.  Marvel at the plastic-covered lamps! Count how many reindeer sweaters are worn - by guys!  Mock the overly-earnest lessons, conveyed by non-actors in period clothing, hair-dos, ""quaint"" settings!

Gentlemen, if you haven't seen this, you're not truly a ""man"" yet.  Ladies, watch this to better understand the male species.  And, parents, if you want your sons to grow up right, here's the full-proof blueprint.",1295913600,5,549,5.044444444444444
8370335,4,B002HGRI9Q,"These are some terrific shorts and are very entertaining, looking back on them now. The Navy film about sailors knocking up their girlfriends. Being trustworthy. Your Body During Adolescence. These and more are great entertainment. Be prepared to watch and laugh.",1266451200,5,263,5.439024390243903
8370336,5,B002HGRI9Q,"I gave this dvd and the companion(of course!) ""How to be a Woman"" video to two different couples this year for the holidays.  Just opening the boxes brought giggles but I was surprised at how much discussion followed watching them.  Younger (early twenties) family members were as amused as they were amazed by the life lessons presented.  For those of us that remembered (at least some) of the educational films we've had inflicted on us it was equally horrifying and hilarious.",1262131200,13,479,4.888888888888889
