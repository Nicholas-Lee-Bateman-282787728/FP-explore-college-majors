8052235,1,B0007VHS70,"This video is supposed to be created for kids, but I found that it didn't even keep my interest. I'm a pilot and I remember watching shows that were far better this episode covering flight. This series is very humanistic biased and grates on my beliefs. They play corny elevator music through all the episodes. Frankly, it was a waste of money. If you are looking for an informative series that kids enjoy watching over and over, find the Popular Mechanics for Kids (PMK) - it's not biased, it's informative, and kids enjoy watching it. my kids will tell me a factoid and when I ask where they learned this, they say ""PMK""!!!",1426291200,,625,4.539823008849558
