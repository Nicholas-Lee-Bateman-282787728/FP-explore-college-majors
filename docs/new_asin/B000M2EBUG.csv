8165752,1,B000M2EBUG,"I bought this because I really liked the DV8 video ""The Cost of Living.""  This one is nothing like that.  It's weird and mostly boring.  I found myself fast-forwarding and thinking ""when is this gonna get good?!?""  I didn't get it and some of the choreographies even made me feel uneasy.  Maybe that makes me unsophisticated or something.  Oh well.  If you liked The Cost of Living, beware of Dead Dreams... it lives up to its title.",1398038400,,433,4.545454545454546

8165754,5,B000M2EBUG,"After Pina Baush influence in the modern dance around the world, several choreographers appear in this style
Dance-drama-theater (European concept)...DV8 is one of them.
Original, really amazing performance and performers
A couple of these pieces were made specially for video, so you can enjoy whole way with them",1363564800,,314,5.5625
8165755,2,B000M2EBUG,"I was slightly disappointed by the title. I've seen DV8 performing couple of times and their performances were entertaining, innovative and had a really good atmosphere.

The DVD consists of 3 pieces, and they're shot for camera, not a performance recording.

I think I had higher expectations, remembering the performances from a long time ago.",1231286400,5,345,5.254545454545455
8165756,5,B000M2EBUG,"Hands down one of the finest of all dance/film collections--for me its only competition is THE COST OF LIVING by the same group.
Powerful, sexy, intellectually stimulating, these imaginative works are stunningly filmed, using a dazzling array of camera techniques.
MONOCHROME MEN feels choreographed for the camera--a study of a serial killer who preys on gay victims, it also explores the on-again, off-again angst of bar hopping and casual sex, mixed up with fears and panics of male bonding. The creepy lighting and camera moves are a revelation, and the dancers and movement some of the best you'll find on film.
STRANGE FISH introduces color, and an atmosphere that echoes neo-realism.
The couplings, comings and goings of a group of young people is book ended by a bombed out building and a singing female Christ figure. The mixture of humor and longing, angst and poetry is unprecedented. The always brilliant imagery is complimented by dancers who can actually act.
ENTER ACHILLES is less successful as a film, but it hardly matters, as it so vividly describes a certain macho mindset--the frightening exhibitions of supressed rage, homoerotic panic, preening and posturing so familiar in films like THE FIGHT CLUB, THE WRESTLER or most exploding car movies. The entrance of a gay outsider into this hermetically sealed bar scene is both disarming and hilarious. He brings some magic to the good old boys, and they face their inner demons. Dance as thrilling entertainment. As good as it gets.",1230595200,17,1501,5.105691056910569
8165757,4,B000M2EBUG,"This compilation of DV8 movies is must have for all physical theater lovers.
Could be better with ""Cost of Living"" included though.
