4487201,5,B004WJV70W,"As far as I'm concerned, ""Skidoo"" is the funniest movie of all time. Where else can you see Jackie Gleason, Peter Lawford, Fred Clark, Slim Pickens, Richard Kiel, Burgess Meredith, and Frank Gorshin tripping on acid? Where else can Frankie Avalon with an awesome caterpillar 'stache? Where else can you see Groucho Marx as a mob boss named God? Where else can you see Carol Channing in her underpants? Nowhere, that's where.

Besides all these insane goings on, there is an amazing soundtrack by the great Harry Nilsson, who also plays the tower guard and sings the ENTIRE end credits. Yes, this film is that awesome.

""Skidoo"" may not be the greatest film of all time, as evidenced by the critics reviews, but it is thoroughly entertaining, colorful, and downright hilarious.

Sadly, the long awaited DVD doesn't have any special features (or good cover art, for that matter) but the transfer is BEAUTIFUL and flawless.

As someone who believes every film should be released on DVD, no matter how ""bad"" they are claimed to be, this is a huge step in the right direction by the film studios. I hope that Olive Films is able to release more of the almost-forgotten classic 60s Paramount comedies on DVD in the near future.",1311292800,35,1221,4.7725118483412325
4487202,4,B004WJV70W,"At this writing, I have not seen the DVD, but have seen Skidoo on VHS.  Not the worst film ever made (not with Hieronymus Merkin lurking about), but perhaps it can be in the ""so bad, it's good"" genre.  People who know Frank Gorshin and Burgess Meredith from ""Batman"", will enjoy their performances in this film, where generational cultures collide when retired mobster, Tony Banks is urged by the syndicate boss (Groucho Marx, wearing the greasepaint moustache of his youth) to do an inside job to wipe out an informant in prison, while his daughter takes up with a hippie (John Phillip Law).
Gleason recalling his youth in splitscreen; one side showing Jackie doing silent film schtick, and his accidental acid trip (from licking the wrong envelope) are among the visual highlights.  The true highlight is Nilsson's music (and bit part as a tower guard, with Fred Clark). The Garbage Can Ballet, The title song, and the entire credits of the film, sung by Nilsson.
(I perform that song, and it never fails to entertain and bewilder.)  There are great visual scenes; many involving Carol Channing, nostalgic performances by an all-star cast, and just seeing Groucho's last cinematic moment smoking pot on a boat, and marveling at it's pumpkin-like taste, is worth owning.  I hope the Preminger estate is less embarrassed by this film, as the growing cult over Skidoo, shows that the world (USA, at least) has caught up to Preminger's vision, and are now appreciating the film on both its own level, and on a kitchy time capsule level.  Now, let's get ""La Prisonierre"", and Anthony Newley's ""Hieronymus Merkin"" film on DVD, please.  All three of these films show the 1968 cinematic zeitgeist at its zenith/nadir, as you perceive it.",1309996800,2,1731,4.907534246575342
4487203,3,B004WJV70W,"It's a laughable mess like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" except Preminger actually knows how to technically make a film.  Unlike Ed Wood's ""Plan,""  ""Skidoo"" had a real budget with real stars.  But like ""Plan,"" it's entertainment derives on how bad it really is.  The scene of Gleason taking acid is worth the price of admission or in this case the price of a rental or if you have lots of discretionary income, price of a DVD.",1309910400,,422,4.441558441558442
4487204,4,B004WJV70W,"I only got to see half of this movie one night on TCM.  I had always wanted to see it because I'm an Otto Preminger fan and it's rarely ever shown (but now is being released on DVD).  It's been treated like it's the worst movie ever made by many critics, who savaged it when it came out in 1968.  The meeting of hippies and Otto Preminger was far too much for the critics to take back in those days, I guess.

Actually having seen the 2nd half of the film made me realise that the film, while not perfect, is actually pretty creative and crazy.  It's hard to recount the plot, as it's pretty convoluted and kind of inconsequential considering the craziness that's going on in the film.  Some of the schtick in the film feels forced, but overall, I found the 2nd half of the film really funny and charming.  Gleason's ride on a baloon is a wonderful highlight, and the whole cast is pretty game given the circumstances.  It was also rather brave of Preminger to try something as experimental as this at this point in his career.  It doesn't always work, but the film has enough positives to make it worth seeing, even for those who don't care for Preminger.

And yes, the final credits are hysterical.  Yes, they are sung by Harry Nilsson, and it is one of the best credit sequences in all of cinema.

Otto Preminger's Skiddo can finally be seen, and it deserves to be.",1309651200,3,1368,4.363636363636363
4487205,5,B004WJV70W,"I've read many reviews of Skidoo but finally having seen it, all I can say is--

It's so insane, it makes YOU insane.

It makes no sense. Sometimes it seems like an adult comedy about the middle aged establishment vs the counterculture. Sometimes it seems like home movies of a Friar's Club meeting. Sometimes it's a live-action cartoon. Absolutely nothing funny ever happens. It features Groucho, Ceaser Romero, Burgess Meredith, Frank Gorshin, Arnold Stang, John Philip Law, Slim Pickens, and naked hippie chicks in body paint. And a sweaty-faced Jackie Gleason taking an ""acid trip.""

Watching a middle-aged Carol Channing in her underwear and thinking, ""Hey, she's not half bad!""?????

THAT's what SKIDOO will DO to YOU.",1308700800,66,724,5.162393162393163
4487206,4,B004WJV70W,"Otto Preminger was roughly 63 when he made 1968's ""Skidoo,"" a youth-bent comedy written by Doran William Cannon, the guy responsible for the script of Robert Altman's ""Brewster McCloud"" (1972).  Otto even experimented taking acid along with Groucho Marx, whom he had cast as ""God"" (the head of ""The Tree,"" the protection racket or the Mob).  The film also starred Jackie Gleason, Carol Channing, John Phillip Law, Frankie Avalon, George Raft, Cesar Romero, Mickey Rooney, Burgess Meredith, Frank Gorshin, Peter Lawford.  At the premiere in 1968, Gleason walked out fuming it was reported.  It was considered an abysmal flop by the critics.  Even though it was definitely a traditional Preminger picture, the whole choice of it was the result of his desire to understand the youth revolution at the time.  As with his next picture, ""Tell Me that You Love Me, Junie Moon"" Preminger wanted to understand what the culture was saying about love as he was always a great humanist.  The film has beforeto been shown on television rarely from the vault at the Preminger estate mostly in embarassment and a great notoriety sprung up about it.  It has been available for quite some time at a high quality DVD-R outlet called thevideobeat.com which specializes in great copies of a youth-based catalog.  They have come to my rescue in finding obscure oddities years before and sometimes as the only miraculous provider of access to these films.  I watch ""Skidoo"" and think the mechanics behind it are entertaining.  I mean so many staples of Preminger's career are skewered, the casting of Burgess Meredith (he turns up in many Preminger films (even in a nude scene in ""Such Good Friends"" (1972)), Doro Merande, Arnold Stang (from ""The Man with the Golden Arm""), clips from ""In Harm's Way"" in a witty segment skewering the lawsuit Preminger won against television cutting his films for commercials.  Harry Nilsson did the music.  Olive Films, whose product in the recent past have been excellent, high quality transfers, has added ""Skidoo"" for a new era in film.  In May, they took on ""Hurry Sundown"" and ""Such Good Friends.""  I thank them sincerely for their efforts and wish them continued success.  It is terribly important that these films are available to get seen and to treat them respectfully deserves due credit.",1304726400,38,2310,4.992167101827676

Hint

However this is a movie is where the inmates are running the asylum so if that's not your style just rent it, similar to King of Hearts in that regard.",1419292800,2,535,4.373737373737374
4487231,2,B004WJV70W,"Otto Preminger was considered a great craftsman but not an important director to be included in the same list with Billy Wilder, John Ford, and Howard Hawks despite the fact that he directed some movies that are undeniable classics including Laura (1944); The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955); Anatomy of a murder (1959) and Advise and Consent (1962).  He was a very successful and consistent director for most of his career but his winning streak ended for good in the mid 1960's and he made movies that were universally panned box office flops for the last 15 years of his career.

Some--Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965); Rosebud (1975) and The Human Factor (1979) have turned out to be much better films than critics claimed at the time.  Skidoo (1968) is the most notorious film from this period and it remains a movie that is very difficult to defend.

Skidoo was Otto Preminger's attempt to prove he wasn't a stuffy old man by making a counter-culture film of sorts.  The plot has to do with retired gangster Tough Tony (Jackie Gleason) being pressured by mafia boss God (Groucho Marx) into assassinating a mobster turned snitch (Mickey Rooney) who is being kept in prison isolation.  Tough Tony gets smuggled into prison as a convict and will be smuggled out within 24 hours of completing the hit.  Meanwhile Jackie Gleason's daughter and wife have become involved with a bunch of free love, body painting, pot smoking hippies.

The movie can be viewed as a comedic representation of the culture clash between the establishment and the youth movement that was going on in the streets across America--but in typical Otto Preminger fashion neither side is depicted in a favorable light.  The established order is represented by gangsters and killers--at one point a mobster played by Frankie Avalon shows off a large flow chart demonstrating how the mob provides the structure that keeps America functioning.  On the other side the hippies are depicted as being lazy, prone to endlessly spouting a lot of empty jargon and wanting to throw out the old without giving any thought to what they want to replace it with.

It's a supremely cynical view of what was going on in America circa 1968, shot as an anarchic anything goes comedy that is very rarely funny.  But Skidoo has some moments that are so bizarre they might be worth sitting through the movie for.  When you think Jackie Gleason's accidental acid trip it sounds weird but it turns out to be even more bizarre than it sounds.  My favorite moment by far happens after everyone in the jail is slipped LSD in the food--two tower guards see the garbage cans in the courtyard come to life and perform a musical number by Nilsson.  It's a sublimely weird sequence and if more of Skidoo went out on that kind of insane limb it would be a much happier experience to sit through.

Otto Preminger should be commended for trying to do something different but he wasn't the right man for this material--it's a farce directed by a man with no feel for comedy, a movie depicting anarchy by a director who was too much of a control freak to allow any genuine disorder into his film.  The man who penned Skidoo also wrote the equally strange Brewster McCloud which was a much better movie because Robert Altman was the perfect director for the material.  Robert Altman was the polar opposite of Otto Preminger--a pot smoking, laid-back almost hippy who liked loose sets and embraced a style where the director didn't have complete control over everything that happened on-screen.  Perfectionist Otto Preminger for all his technical mastery could never have made M*A*S*H*--it required a different set of skills than Preminger brought to his movies and it also required youth, which is something that can't be faked no matter how talented the director.

Otto Preminger was not the right director to make Skidoo which is not funny and feels like the work of an old man trying to capture something that he's not capable of understanding--but it's still probably worth sitting through once for its stranger moments--where else can you see the floating disembodied head of Groucho Marx spinning around during an acid trip?  Only in Skidoo.",1419033600,,4184,4.840112201963534

4487235,4,B004WJV70W,"I'm glad to see that stoners appreciate Skidoo, since their discriminating taste makes it hard for them to find anything to amuse themselves. That Preminger made a movie enjoyed half a century later by both stoners and people who use their brains for thinking is testimony to his genius. It's a fantastic movie, much smarter and more successful than most viewers realize.

People who think it's stupid, who mock its clueless depiction of the 60s counterculture, should first look in a mirror to see what stupid looks like and then make their snarky comments. If Preminger had wanted to document what hippies were like he could have done that, but Skidoo is a farce, not a documentary. Gleason's acid trip isn't supposed to show what acid is really like, it's supposed to be corny and funny.

THIS MOVIE IS A FARCE, folks! The Banks family isn't supposed to be like a real family, the gangsters like real gangsters, the hippies like real hippies, or the acid trip like a real acid trip. Skidoo is supposed to be freewheeling and totally off the wall, and it is.

People take this fascinating movie either too seriously or not seriously enough, and it's because they don't understand what it is. It's unlike any other movie made in the 1960s or any other time, and it can't be evaluated in terms of anything but itself. It's a delightfully zany movie, and it holds up extremely well. Since it IS a farce, not a documentary, it isn't dated at all. It's fresh and alive.

Gleason is fantastic, showing wide-ranging sensitivity and subtlety people who know him only as Ralph Kramden never saw. Rooney is great too, especially in the scene where he's talking to Gleason on the radio. But this is really an ensemble movie, and Preminger orchestrated his large and diverse cast marvelously. It's neat to see a veteran like Gleason working so well with a newcomer like Pendleton.

I was young and naive then, so I had no idea what a psychedelic experience was supposed to be like, and I guess I assumed it would look something like this. Looking back, I can say I think it would be horrifying to drop acid with Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney.  Apparently, Otto Preminger had just discovered LSD and was trying to express his feelings about it.  Make no mistake, I don't love this movie because it is a good movie, but it is a weird little piece of the sixties that can only be explained by "" It was the sixties, man!""  Harry Nilsson has said he was told to act like he was under the influence of LSD, but he hadn't, at that time, imbibed; so he acted drunk.  This movie fits very well in the AIP type of drug expose, except it's a comedy, with lots of old Hollywood acting silly (Groucho is God-don't tell Eric) It fits the time in a way that makes me smile.  Like ""The Party"" or ""We Love You, Alice B. Toklas"" or ""Beyond the Valley Of the Dolls""  These films could only exist in that part of the sixties and early seventies.  What can I say?  They fulfilled something in me as a sign of a time that won't come again, yet they really aren't in any way a part of the culture they are talking about.  A bunch of old guys going ""Oh you crazy hippies, can we play too?""  Fun to watch in a weird way.  It was the sixties, man!",1385683200,5,1382,4.0777777777777775

All the old-school show-biz personalities (just look at the amazing credits) crammed into a ""Mad, Mad World"" kind of movie mayhem with ludicrous plot lines and contrivances to make every kind of in-joke that they thought would be hip at the time.

The infamous Jackie Gleason acid freakout is a lot of fun, and the Carol Channing number at the end is a treasure. The cast of this movie probably had a blast making it.

We have Groucho Marx in his first big part in 16 years, and.............  just like Mae West in the 1970 movie mentioned above, we have a singular reason to watch something which cries out for multitudinous reasons - it works hard to present a light-hearted clash of cultures, even if one is organized crime and the other is hippiedom. Actually, this Reviewer found the screenplay occasionally brilliant. But with all these Hollywood Legends, something was definitely missing, throughout.

Jackie Gleason is JG, and despite his obvious lack of enthusiasm, manages some cool Gleasonisms, as the semi-retired hood. (Honeymooners fans will enjoy alot of familiar mugging and off-kilter utterances. George Raft has some pleasing moments as The Skipper of the schooner owned by ""God"", Groucho Marx [he's the head of the ""organization""]).

Carol Channing gets the most out of the largely humourless script - she sings and dances and gets the benefit of voyeuristic direction, particularly in a wild seduction scene with Frankie Avalon, another actor who seems to find a way through the confused proceedings. Don't know why this famous singer did not get a chance to warble, especially when the rock-era Harry Nillson did the music.

Tasteless story aside, what really could have sold this venture would be a funny script...imagine a comedy with Groucho Marx and no memorable (or unmemorable) one-liners?

The Gleason - Marx connection is there for the researchers: About one year before this movie mess, the two great ones got together on The Jackie Gleason Show. Both sang and danced together...one of those true time-capsule moments. Perhaps the fans should first check out the long clip on the ever-dependable youtube.com. Interesting that Frankie also appeared on The Jackie Gleason Show around 1953, as a trumpeteer!

(Another Reviewer adroitly pointed out that ""real"" 1968 hippies were used successfully - worth 1/2 *!).",1320969600,9,2184,5.155367231638418
4487263,4,B004WJV70W,"Except for 'Revolution' (a 1968 Documentary - NOT! on DVD), 'Skidoo' has actual *real* hippies from the 'heart' of the world of Flower Power & Peace and Love: San Francisco, California.

P.S. Another overlooked item - in the SINGING! credits at the end of the film, STONE COUNTRY is credited as ""Themselves"".

4487264,2,B004WJV70W,"Before I go on, let me state that (1) I am a big fan of Otto Preminger's films, both his highs and his lows,(2) I have adored Groucho Marx since I was a kid and own every film he's appeared in that's available on dvd,(3) am likewise a fan of Frank Gorshin, Cesar Romero and Burgess Meredith (and not just because of their legendary villain status on TV's 'Batman'), and (4) absolutely love 60's cinema, camp and cult flicks and celebrated 'trainwrecks' from this era. Needless to say, I was elated to find out Olive Films was finally releasing this movie to both the delight and chagrin of movielovers worldwide. Though they never offer us much by way of bonus features, trailers or even photo galleries, the films themselves are always beautiful transfers with mostly superb audio as well ('Hurry Sundown' had a few issues, but nothing too distracting).

I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film on some level, on ANY level, as I can usually find something enjoyable in almost all films from this era (read all my 60's film reviews as proof - I have high tolerance, fondness and forgiveness for some great cinematic turkeys, and I do mean stinkers), and didn't think this would be difficult to do with a fabulous cast like this and director such as Preminger, but for the first time in my life I'm struck speechless. I understand and agree with other reviewer's claims concerning  the time-honored clich about ""so bad it's good"" and how we cinephiles have the entitlement to enjoy trainwrecks if we want to (as I frequently do), but am finding  it impossible to say something positive about this flick, and apologize in advance for this comment.

I thought Gleason was both miscast and unlikable in the lead and gave a miserable performance (by now, we have all read the story about him walking out during the premiere in disgust and though this was certainly justifiable I wonder if it wasn't also because he realized just how bad he was), and found no one else entertaining either except Carol Channing, and this is shocking for me as I personally never liked her in anything, but I'm no fan of musicals. No one of the actors was given a role they could possibly sink teeth into, and most of them only had a few moments of screen time anyway - Burgess Meredith appeared for no more than a minute, but thankfully, he wasn't naked as he was in 'Such Good Friends' (a great recent release by Olive Films with Dyan Cannon blazing in probably her best performance). The concoction of youthful hippies (John Phillip Law in a typically wooden, sterile role as a clichd guru) clashing with aging silver screen actors is an oil and water mixture that never gels for a moment and even becomes embarrassing when the entire prison is supposed to be tripping on acid during a breakout that's as far-fetched as it is unfunny. Adding insult to injury, both Groucho (who is 'God' where I come from) and Mickey Rooney are blatantly reading their lines off of cuecards, and there's not a joke present anywhere (though Groucho's squeeze, model Luna, is a joy to behold in her various form-revealing attire). The ultimate film felony for me was Nilsson's wretchedly insipid soundtrack which was supposed to lend credence to the 60's youth movement on display but instead revealed what a rift between the generations this film ultimately proved to be - his cloying attempt to be 'happening' made the Archies sound like Hendrix. Again, I apologize to those who feel differently, but nothing in this flick worked for me at all.

Even camp classic fiascos like 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Mad World', 'Casino Royale', 'Candy', 'Valley of the Dolls' and 'Myra Breckenridge' come off as significant works of art in comparison. In spite of all I've said, I was still happy to have seen it, and have now added a new nadir to my cinematic sewer water level. If you're still curious, rent this one, as I don't see how most folks will find it worth rescreening like most of the other flops mentioned above, all of which I did enjoy, so a cinesnob I'm not.
If you'd like to see a well-done, big cast bad movie by a great director, then by all means 'Skidoo', if you're looking for a fine film, then 'Skedaddle'...",1313625600,4,4187,4.652702702702703
4487265,1,B004WJV70W,"I used to think CASINO ROYALE, the bloated James Bond spoof with four directors, an actor who walked off halfway through (Peter Sellers), and enough lame jokes to fill a thousand 1970's variety shows (especially ""The Starland Vocal Band Variety Hour""), was the worst comedy of the 1960's--and there were plenty to choose from.

But then I saw SKIDOO.  At least with CASINO ROYALE, you got a couple chuckles out of Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond near the stupefyingly-awful climax.  With SKIDOO, there wasn't one joke that worked.  Peter Sellers stormed off the set of CASINO ROYALE because...well, Sellers was insane.  To get whatever greatness Sellers possessed on film was a minor miracle considering his crazy behavior.  Supposedly, Jackie Gleason stormed out of the screening for SKIDOO...and I'm ready to declare him a genius.  And offer him my condolences.

This movie has popped up on cable twice now and I watched it both times.  I just wanted to be sure it was as godawful as I thought (I did the same with the grotesque cinematic abortion, NOTHING BUT TROUBLE).  Because when I see the positive reviews for this abomination...I gotta wonder what these people were on.  Probably the same thing the makers of SKIDOO ingested.",1312416000,5,1228,4.941463414634146

Picture and sound are quite okay on a 40'' screen. But this is it. The DVD doesn't contain any extras, neither subtitles nor trailers. Just the movie itself. How poor.
Another thing I cannot understand is the ridiculous code restriction RC1 on this DVD with a movie from 1968. Hey, publishers - this is 2011, how can you afford any kind of regional code restrictions on DVDs or Blu-rays anyway? What comes next? New technique disabling people from other regions to read physical books and magazines?

4487267,3,B004WJV70W,"a bad hollywood attempt to address the psychedelic era, with a serious director and a memorable cast?  sounds like fun.  with the potential of a classic bad film that bungles it's way into the hysterical.  unfortunately, as it turns out, not so much.

carol channing is game and fairly well provided for.  but why cast a great comedian like jackie gleason to play an irritatingly grim thug?  despite looking uncomfortably frail, groucho tries to put a little personality into his lines, but, again, there's no attempt a providing him with any humor.  and why go to all the trouble of casting all of the villains from the batman tv show and not use the opportunity for at least some sort of gag?  maybe otto found the whole alcatraz scene a pretty hip take-off on the p.o.w. gig he worked with Stalag 17, but funny it ain't.

and if this is his attempt to be contemporary, the leaden and bland portrayal of hippie life proves him to be pretty clueless about the cultural changes he claims to be celebrating.  compare this with I Love You Alice B Toklas, which may be equally stereotypical, but at least it was actually funny, and displayed some modicum of affection for it's characters.

harry nillson's contributions (the convincingly radiant trashcan dance, the closing credits) are allowed to shine throughout.  and there are plenty of moments that reflect the clash that abounds in 1968,  but you're probably better off with any episode of rowan and martin's laugh in or the smothers brothers comedy hour.",1311811200,2,1508,4.7984496124031
4487268,2,B004WJV70W,"Skidoo is an infamous Hollywood bomb that sits alongside Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Valley of the Dolls as one of the worst movies ever made.  It is rivaled in its awfulness only by its sheer bizarreness.  However, the biggest problem with Skidoo is that it self-consciously tries so hard to be bizarre that it winds up just being boring.  It's really only of interest because of its decidedly unusual cast (including Jackie Gleason, Carol Channing, Frankie Avalon, Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, John Phillip Law, Mickey Rooney, Frank Gorshin, Peter Lawford and Groucho Marx) and Harry Nilsson's eccentric music.  The movie never becomes more than a morbid curiosity.  Yes it's odd, but it simply isn't the demented masterpiece that so many (including me) wish it was.",1311724800,7,784,5.09375

 when i was first told about a acid flick with Jackie Gleason and Carol Channing i went ""no really"". well yeah really.and it's pretty insane. especially the dancing garbage cans.

4487270,5,B004WJV70W,"The conventional wisdom on this movie (amply supported by both positive and negative reviews here on Amazon and on IMDb) is that it's either an awful, embarrassing, train-wreck of a movie that wastes it's star-laden cast, or that it's hugely entertaining, but only because of how terrible it is. I beg to differ on both counts.

For starters, people, it's a satire! It's not supposed to be taken at face value, although I believe it has a serious message underneath all the silliness. Satirized at various points throughout are gangsters, television, the judicial system, consumerism, playboys, technology, government, and (very gently) hippies. I think some people probably have trouble following the movie because the plot is fairly intricate; if you're not paying close attention you will miss plot points that make later events more comprehensible. The first time I saw this I was mildly amused, but each time I watch it, it gets better and I get more out of it.

There are even scattered moments of brilliance, dare I say it. The opening scene of Jackie Gleason and Carol Channing dueling with their TV remotes, flipping between the sadly too-realistic senate hearing and amusingly insipid commercials is priceless and spot on. Gleason's assessment of Law's hippie character also brought a smile to my face (""How come you're driving a beat-up Rolls instead of a beat-up Ford? How does that fit with your beliefs?"") The acid-trip sequences are actually quite well done, more closely resembling an actual trip, and especially the behavior of those on a trip, than many expressly drug-oriented movies of the time (except maybe for the dancing garbage cans), perhaps because Otto Preminger actually experimented with LSD before making the movie. And everyone from the big names to the bit players are excellent in their roles and play everything straight--with no mugging or winking at the camera--all the way. Austin Pendleton, in particular, as ""Fred the Professor,"" is in top form and nearly steals the show. (And is that Corbett Monica dancing on top of Slim Pickens's switchboard?)

I see this more as a critique of dog-eat-dog capitalism (as represented by the gangsters) than just a meaningless farce. I think the most telling scene is where Gleason (""the best torpedo in the business"") drops acid, ""loses his ego,"" and realizes just how morally/spiritually bankrupt the violent, money-obsessed gangster life is. And while the hippies are occasionally gently mocked (""If you can't dig nothing, you can't dig anything"") I really feel that the film's heart is on their side, making Skidoo essentially a 98-minute commercial for peace, love, and understanding, and really one of the best countercultural movies of the '60s (especially since it was made by a 62-year-old ""member of the establishment""). Compare this to other '60s ""youth oriented"" cheese fests (which I love) such as Riot on Sunset Strip, The Big Cube, The Love-Ins, etc., and you'll find that Skidoo's depiction of the hippies is actually more realistic (and sympathetic) and that it carries a more serious message (!!).

Try to clear your head of all the ""train wreck"" and ""so-bad-it's-good"" propaganda before watching this and I think you'll find a rather sly, sophisticated, and quite funny comedy. I think Preminger was light-years ahead of both audiences and critics in 1968 (and apparently still is), accounting for its failure at the box office more than the quality of the movie itself. That, and the fact that it's so hard to pigeonhole: is it a gangster movie, a comedy, or a youth-market drug flick?

The Olive Films DVD is bare-bones, with no extras other than chapter stops, but is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen, and the print is in overall great shape, with good color and contrast and virtually no blemishes or other damage. If you're a fan of this film, pick it up and support the release of obscure gems like this. You will not be disappointed.

4487271,5,B004WJV70W,"""The only thing that matters is with who you do."" This, a lyric from the title song, is exuberantly sung by Carol Channing toward the end of this cinematic milestone, which--like other fabulous failures of its ilk--may have had a VHS shelf life of about 20 minutes (and most likely a smeary pan-and-scan print at that) and is now receiving its DVD due in glorious letterbox. Evidently a professional mastering job, too, not one of these ""archive"" print-per-order on DVD-R deals you'd save money copying off Turner Classics yourself.

When Carol Channing lost the film role of Dolly to Barbra Streisand, her ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" co-star Julie Andrews--who certainly knew how she felt after her own experience with ""My Fair Lady""--is said to have consoled her with ""Don't worry. You'll get your 'Mary Poppins'."" What Ms. Channing got, of course, was SKIDOO.

The enjoyment of this kind of movie, of course, is to watch the glorious ineptitude and wonder WHAT anyone involved in the making of this mess could possibly have been thinking. Otto Preminger is certainly not the name one might think of to direct a wacky counterculture comedy. Jackie Gleason on an acid trip? (Actually, he's quite credible; other actors--such as Fred Clark in a later scene--pretending to be stoned merely act drunk.) Carol's feathery yellow Rudi Gernrich which makes her look like Big Bird in drag? Mickey Rooney with a ticker tape machine in his jail cell? Frankie Avalon's push-button apartment? (Architects of increasingly smaller living spaces could take notes.) Arnold Stang and Groucho Marx (his last movie, as ""God"") with pale, withered faces and shoe-blacking hair? The plot? (You'll need to watch this more than once to figure out what's going on, but you'll enjoy the hippie putting a flower in the teeth of a portrait of Ronald Reagan.) The sung end credits? This was clearly a high-ticket production, too.

It's very encouraging when so-bad-they're-still-not-good-but-they're-fun films are rescued from obscurity and re-released as proudly as they should be. Next up, I hope, will be Rosalind Russell in OH DAD POOR DAD, MAMMA'S HUNG YOU IN THE CLOSET AND I'M FEELIN' SO SAD--another one that has to be seen to be believed.",1311465600,3,2218,5.071232876712329
