8073555,1,B000A32VEA,This DVD did not work. I did not send an email to this person because I did not even watch the movie. I put it in one day a year after I watched it and it did not work. Very disappointed!,1327190400,,187,3.5853658536585367
8073556,3,B000A32VEA,"lot has been said about this film, after the success of the blockbuster Titanic. It's thrilling to see Leonardo di Caprio acting in a down to earth feature.",1228176000,4,156,4.607142857142857

Natural performing by then young recent stars makes this clear-student-project film nice to watch on any viewer's personal merits.",1201651200,5,301,6.341463414634147
8073558,5,B000A32VEA,"Don's Plum made in 8 days of shooting from an outline that was then improvised by the actors is an exceptional piece of ""film verite"" work that was made on the lowest of budgets and shot on 16mm. Certainly, Leonardo DiCaprio shows us how remarkably talented and agile he can be with or without a scripted piece. His performance shines.

I saw the opriginal directors' cut, as well as the finished film on 35mm blow up and the film will remain a clear expose' of the young modern urban California characters it represents for all time.

The rest of the cast surround DiCaprio with fine work. Expecially that of Kevin Connolly, Bryan Thames, Amber Benson and Meadow Sisto. This is a film that will never be forgotten and it is still sad that it had such an unfortunate fate never to be seen in the context of the time in which it was made, except for outside the US and Canada.",1149724800,17,875,4.428571428571429
