Nothing like what the kids are watching these days.",1395964800,,363,4.2
8421381,4,B004B3AH9Q,"""Top Enders"" was made in 1988 by the Australian Children's
Television Foundation which was a non-profit organization
established to ensure that children have access to high quality
media created especially for them. There were a number of
television productions made under this banner and this feature
is one of them.

Although it is good, clean, wholesome entertainment aimed
specifically at children and the fact that children have important
roles to play in the features, they still provide reasonably good
entertainment for adults should they care to watch them.

The title of the movie ""Top Enders"" refers to those people who
live in Australia at the northern tip of the Northern Territory.

The story is about Alice, a young girl who lives alone with her
mother and can do very well without her drifter and no-hoper
father.  She is not impressed when her father decides to return
home to live and in disgust she leaves home taking the family
4-wheel drive buggy with her even though she is not old enough to
get a licence to drive.

She eventually teams up with a young local Aboriginal boy named
Mick who has also run off in search of the outstation where his
community is living. They both have few survival skills and soon
become lost in the desert when their vehicle runs out of fuel.
Mick of course, being Aboriginal, has a talent for survival and
eventually finds food and water and his way across the arid
terrain.

An interesting and entertaining little story that shows how
barren and isolated the Australian outback can be.",1325548800,,1539,4.832699619771863
