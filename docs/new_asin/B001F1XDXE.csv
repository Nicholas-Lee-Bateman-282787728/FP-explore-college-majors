8300600,5,B001F1XDXE,This is the best version of Puchini's opera Tosca that I have ever seen. Loved it.,1446595200,4,82,4.1875
8300601,5,B001F1XDXE,"Beautiful cinematography and great performances throughout.  I first checked this out from Netflix, watched it several times and then reluctantly returned it.  I couldn't get it out of my head and so, finally got a copy for myself so I could watch any time I wanted!!",1442880000,7,267,4.782608695652174
8300602,5,B001F1XDXE,"This is a delicious, one-of-a-kind tour-de-force, a gift to the future from Puccini---who would doubtless have embraced the whole mad concept and thrown himself into its execution. And, hell: Storaro's the cinematographer! This Blu-Ray disc is also a gift to the future---from engineers who recorded it in high-def long before it was commercially available.",1440806400,5,357,5.62962962962963
