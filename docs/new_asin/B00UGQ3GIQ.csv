7038824,5,B00UGQ3GIQ,"This is actually a very good movie. It's a typical earth invaded by aliens flick, but it had one twist that I haven't seen before. The labeling talks too much, written by some exec who had more ink then common sense. Watch the movie before you read the container. An interesting twist developed consistently and intriguingly. I've never seen this idea developed like this. This movie is worth checking out",1468022400,2,405,4.8
7038845,5,B00UGQ3GIQ,"This is actually quite a good movie.  It was poorly named and marketed; otherwise I think it would have done much better at the box office.  Might be the only recent Tom Cruise movie I'd rwcommend.  Emily Blunt is great, by the way.",1500595200,,232,4.348837209302325

7038847,5,B00UGQ3GIQ,"I am a huge fan of movies involving time loops, especially in situations where it's very similar to a video game and you're constantly replaying this one particular Boss Battle over and over, and all the tropes that come with it. And this is the exact kind of thing I'm into!
Yeah it's a little generic but I always end up watching it at least once a month. Definitely an All Time Fav!",1490572800,3,385,4.287671232876712

7038849,5,B00UGQ3GIQ,As many times as he lives dies and repeats that's about how many times we watch this DVD just love it. Looking to watch something that will hold your  interest from start to finish this is the one,1483660800,,196,4.157894736842105

7038851,5,B00UGQ3GIQ,"Excellent Movie.  There is action...lots of that, interwoven with aliens and and a good dose of Groundhog day.  The story is good and moves through the various plot points smoothly allowing the watcher to not get bogged down and lost...or worse - bored.  There are little twists every now and then which in-turn makes for story-telling.  Aye...but I am rambelling.  Watch the movie.  Buy the movie.  Then watch the movie again.  This is a good thing.",1471305600,,450,4.828947368421052

7038853,5,B00UGQ3GIQ,"WOW ! ! You may want to watch this one over and over and over again. Ha Ha, just kidding.
Seriously though it is an excellent choice if you like a good action movie. The repeat story gets
better and better and better. There is a very good story line, good acting all around, fast
action that actually gets faster in some scenes, and a great ending. It doesn't get much better.",1470441600,,376,4.236111111111111

8706106,1,B00UGQ3GIQ,"In the description,  it said blu-ray plus dvd and the picture also had a digital copy.  We only received a blu-ray.  All I can say is I am pissed.  I could buy the Blu-ray alone for $8.00, but I wanted the DVD and digital copy also, that is why I paid $26.00.  What a RIP off.",1526688000,4,276,3.857142857142857
