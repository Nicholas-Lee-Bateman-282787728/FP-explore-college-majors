8333213,1,B001PF7494,The quality of filming is of poor quality. The announcer has a boring and unvaried voice (couldn't even pronounce the name of the cities so you could understand it. I am Danish and had to figure out what she meant!)  Absolutely not worth wasting time on. Buy a book about Jutland and look at the pictures!!!!!! I still feel bad that I have spent money on the DVD !!!!!,1237852800,3,368,4.333333333333333
