I felt like I was waiting for the big reveal the whole way through the video, and in the end, almost nothing was revealed other than that the facts claimed in Chronicles and Kings slightly vary from each other, because one is a literal history, and the other is meant to be seen as a foreshadowing of what the messianic age might look like.",1481328000,,402,4.302631578947368
8530435,5,B008U20EBK,We love Rabbi Tovia! Many questions are answered in this teaching about the end of the age with detailed clarification of many mistaught concepts.,1463443200,,146,5.125

8530437,2,B008U20EBK,I like Tovia's  radio show &  website teaching. But am very disappointed in the DVD. I felt like it ended without my having any knowledge on how the book of  Chronicles  plays a part in the  end time prophecy. It just ended and I felt like I had  missed the whole point..,1424736000,2,271,4.115384615384615
8530438,5,B008U20EBK,"Rabbi Tovia Singer, who is famous for his lectures and debates in the ongoing Christianity versus Judaism discussion, takes an entirely different tack in this Chronicles presentation.  As the lecture proceeds, we become aware that the Rabbi is not taking his usual polemical approach to Scripture, as showcased in his audio series, ""Let's Get Biblical.""  Rather, he is off on an adventure, and taking his audience with him.  He's leading a treasure hunt to discover the nature and meaning of the outright contradictions between Chronicles and other books in Tanach which cover many of the same events.

In his inimitable style, Rabbi Singer paints a rich contextual background, treats us to a taste of Jewish and secular history, provides insight into the life and work of an amazing 15th century Jewish sage--Abarbanel--and illuminates 20th century events in light of prophetic insights.  All of this he does mostly in English, but for this venue, his audience's knowledge of Hebrew is a given.  For those viewers who don't speak Hebrew, the video provides helpful onscreen translations of Hebrew terminology and onscreen displays of Scripture passages.

I found myself pausing the video in several places, taking time to absorb the onscreen definitions, Scripture passages, and commentary.  The surprising conclusion--which ties together the prophetic voice of Chronicles and 20th century events--left me listening hard for the footsteps of the Messiah.

If you are at all interested in prophecy, or just want to dig deeper than the surface of Chronicles, Samuel, and Kings, this lecture is an important one to add to your library.",1346371200,11,1633,5.274131274131274
8530439,5,B008U20EBK,"Rabbi Singer explores a new topic here, offering some very interesting insights.  I hope there will be more on the prophetic books in the future.  I recommend this, and his Let's Get Biblical lectures and book as well.",1345939200,4,218,4.7105263157894735
8530440,4,B008U20EBK,"Rabbi Singer is an honest, passionate, and entertaining teacher and was able to find Hashem's message of teshuva and forgiveness and hope in redemption from typically ignored scripture.  May Hashem hasten the redemption in our days.",1345420800,7,232,5.444444444444445
