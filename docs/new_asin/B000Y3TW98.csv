8230895,1,B000Y3TW98,This was the worst aviation documentary I have ever purchased. Don't buy it as it is a total ripoff. The video hardly even talks about the Boeing 787. Instead it shows planes taking off and landing at an airport which is not even worth watching.,1266710400,3,245,4.466666666666667
8230896,3,B000Y3TW98,This is truly a documentary.  Probably would not hold the interest of those not into airplane building.,1264550400,2,103,5.0588235294117645
