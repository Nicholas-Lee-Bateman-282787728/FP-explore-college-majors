38773,1,0782008372,"I read all of the reviews people had posted here on Amazon.com but because I love the Highlander movie so much I just couldn't help myself and ordered the DVD.  What a mistake!  The DVD version of Highlander is possibly the  worst movie experience I have ever had.
The video is so grainy in parts  that it looks like a cloudy sheet of textured plastic was put in front of  the camera while it was filming.  The audio is plagued with balancing  problems with dialog so soft in some scenes that you can't hear it.  Surround effects are poorly done.  Even the soundtrack doesn't sound very  good, and this is a digital medium that is superior to CD!
This DVD is  abysmal!  I can't believe anyone could have watched this and thought it was  a good product.  The studio should be ashamed!  Do not do what I did and  ignore these reviews: trust me, no matter how much you love Highlander, you  will hate the DVD version!  Somehow studios have to get the message that  consumers will not put up with garbage like this.  The best way to start is  NOT TO BUY THIS DVD!",923529600,8,1059,4.328205128205128
38774,5,0782008372,"There can only be one, instead of seeing sequels just watch it again and again.  What puts this movie apart from others?  The wonderful translations between scenes as it flashes back into the past and back into the present.  In fact it seems to falter in this only once..and recently I found out that  was due to editing (the directors cut should have that extra flashback).  Anyway, it is a wonderful film and if you haven't seen it you must!",919036800,,443,4.4875
38775,4,0782008372,"Highlander is an awsome movie to begin with. But on DVD the picture quality is less then perfect, that I agree with but one has to understand a few basethings about the movie. First of all Highlander was not a bigbudget  extravaganza but rather a small production that was a huuuuge success. And  being a small budget film the quality of the original fotage is less than  perfect so the DVD has that quality too. DVD dosent preform magic and  cannot make the picture cristalclear on Highlander. So the DVD is more for  the fans and collectors rather than the average viewer. If your only going  to buy it because you want to see the movie and don't care for all the  trimmings on the DVD, buy the VHS instead since the quality of picture and  sound is the same on this on. Maybe the sound is better on the DVD but it's  not worth it in itself.",917395200,,843,4.284810126582278
38776,4,0782008372,Here's the original fantasy/swashbuckler starring Christopher Lambert as the immortal Scot with a French accent posing as an Antique dealer in New York by day and amputating heads by night. Forget those drossy sequels that  have more contradictions and paradoxes than Connor MacLeod has years and  check out the REAL Highlander adventure.

38858,2,0782008372,"Poor transfer. A great deal of the sound is trash. Parts sound as if they were recorded from inside a toilet a couple dozen yards away. Dialogue is occasionally unintelligible. I understand that the video quality was never great to begin with, but this transfer improves upon what is there. It is the audio, however, that wrecks this release. Bear in minds that I am referring to the 30th anniversary transfer, not one of the others.

I hope the film will be remastered for 4K release. It's an awful movie, you realize, once you're no longer the same kid who saw this in theaters. The 80's had a lot of terrible films we loved, because we were kids and we were stupid. But it does take you back, for better or for worse.

Crap that it is, I'd buy it again if it were remastered.",1519430400,,778,4.358620689655172

Sean Connery was made up for stage, not screen, and pretty much played himself as usual.  Clancy Brown was the only actor with any chops, doing an excellent job of being sleezy and evil.

I went here in desperation because I was doing a movie night to pass this tradition on to my teens - but found the dvd I had was the Director's Cut... and after too many scenes had been altered, added, and generally ruined from the smooth transitions and sharp eye on editing to make a great movie into a terrible one, I gave up, popped the disc out, and went searching online.  The Amazon listing DID NOT STATE IT WAS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT - if it HAD, I'd NEVER have rented it.  We scrolled the mouse to fast-forward, and there were the same extra scenes from the Director's Cut!  Awful.  I feel gypped, my money is gone, and our movie night ruined.  Thanks, Amazon.

I forgot how terrible it was, or maybe I just didn't realize how bad it was at the time because of how most 80's action movies were. Did we just not expect any better? The leads are all pretty one dimensional aside from Sean Connery, but even he is confined. The action sequences are not so impressive that they should have had to settle for bad acting. And the one liners! Terrible. Anyhow, the premise can be interesting if you're into fantasy and sci-if. The execution of it and the style of the film just doesn't hold up.

39329,5,0782008372,"There's been much ado about the new Highlander transfer from StudioCanal, now presented on Region 1 Blu-ray from Lionsgate. Highlander, which has suffered a terrible 1997 DVD and a mediocre 2010 Blu-ray, has finally been given new life through a 4K transfer and restoration of the original camera negative, improving the color, removing nicks scratches and stains, and improving image stability all around... or so the press releases have said. With Highlander having such a spotty track record on home video, it's understandable to go into this release with some trepidation. But I'm happy to report that such trepidation is really not necessary, as this is a truly wonderful new lease on life for the film.

Doing a direct comparison with the earlier 2010 Blu-ray shows improvements all across the board. Sharpness and clarity have been greatly improved on a base level. Details are finer. The natural grain structure of the film is no longer compromised by artificial sharpening, reduction, noise or any intrusive digital alterations or anomalies, and presents a naturally filmic appearance. Colors are warmer and more pleasing. Dark scenes showcase levels of detail never seen before due to the absence of crush. Color banding and aliasing are a non-issue, and only some fleeting compression artifacts creep in from time to time (but won't be readily noticeable unless you're looking for it).

The special features present on the previous release (deleted scenes, director commentary) have been ported over alongside new features including two interviews with lead actor Christopher Lambert (one newly produced, the other from around the release of Highlander: Endgame), an extensive archival documentary called The Making of Highlander, a remastered trailer and a new interview with director Russell Mulcahy. The results are a rather meaty assortment of bonus features, and they're all a must for longtime fans and film aficionados alike.

So yeah, feel free to toss out that old 2010 release, because this new one beats it in every regard. It's hard to argue with a release when the results are so pleasing.",1479513600,18,2113,5.245562130177515

Not exactly what a Krugan is, but Clancy Brown gives a performance that would tickle the fancy of all 17 year old metalheads in 1986, at least. Lots of tongue flicking and awkward sword play.

With a better cast, better director, a much bigger budget, and somebody besides Queen doing the music, this might have been a decent sci-fi/fantasy epic.

Crystal clean audio with virtually no mono/stereo hiss in 85% of the audio and almost unnoticeable unless you really listen in the rest of the movie! The HDR lighting is amazing. Very well done. The parking lot at the beginning is so crisp and so detailed you can see everything and it is bright enough to see everything for the first time! Some scenes like flash backs to Scotland are still blurry but they fit the scene well, but still much cleaner and clearer than ever before. The Audio Mixing is dang near perfect. I noticed no flaws that ruined my experience or damaged the immersiveness of the film. This was a 4K restoration movie that benefited greatly from the iconic artsy directing style and the way he used lighting to make some fight scenes look surreal and magical like you would see in an anime. The 4K restoration is almost 100% perfect. The few blurry flashbacks are still cleaner than they were. And everything else looks and sounds more engrossing than ever before!  It is a 100% cut and dry better than any copy released before this was! They even restored a lot of the deleted scenes!! This really is a kind of magic! The sound track is crystal clear and sounds like it is a studio quality recording. You cannot even tell it was made in the late 80's on a budget!",1476489600,4,1449,4.447368421052632

39921,5,0782008372,"The 1986 cult classic ""Highlander"" is one of the most fondly remembered films from that glorious decade. While by no means perfect, it features fun performances, a cool story concept, stylish direction, a dose of 80's cheese and a great soundtrack by Queen. It is most definitely a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Even though it tells a single self cotained story, it wound up spawning some truly awful sequels along with a decent television series as well as an animated film in 2007.

This film has seen many DVD and bluray releases over the years. The previous Studio Canal bluray release in the UK was a fully loaded special edition that featured copius extras but had picture quality which suffered from noticeable digital noise that robbed it of much of its potential detail. The previous Lionsgate release in the states utilized the same transfer but left off the extensive feature length making of documentary featured on the Studio Canal release.

It was announced earlier this year that Studio Canal was performing a 4K restoration of the film for a new bluray release which featured an expanded version of the prior making of documentary (from originally about 90 to now 120 minutes), new interviews with the director Russel Mulcahy and star Christopher Lambert (about 20 minutes each) in addition to the vintage commentary track from the director and prior featurettes. Lionsgate would bring this new 30th anniversary bluray out here in the states.

The new transfer from the 4K restoration is truly breathtaking for fans of the film. All of the digital noise that plagued the previous bluray transfer is gone. Detail has been greatly improved along with contrast and black levels, skin tones look much more natural and it is like seeing the film again for the first time. No digital noise reduction appears to have been used so the natural film grain levels are retained for a nice filmic touch. The bit rate is healthy getting into the mid 30's during busy moments. I doubt the film ever looked this great before even in theaters! Audio is well defined and punchy. Feel free to upgrade to this new edition as this is truly the definitive edition of the director's cut of ""Highlander"". There can be only one.",1475625600,52,2248,4.818652849740933

Good job on the audio too!  All the music, dialogue, sound effects, etc. are still there louder and clearer than ever!

I'm not usually a big fan of director's cuts, but the extra scenes actually help with the flow of the story without changing its context.

39980,5,0782008372,"HIGHLANDER, classic sci-fi adventure film with Christopher lambert & sean connery
has now been given a new 30th Anniversary blu-ray reissue with new 4k HD restoration transfer
by Lionsgate which will be released in september for the U.S. fans
but U.K.'s Studio canal came in first and released this 30th blu-ray reissue few weeks ago now on amazon uk
the U.K. blu-ray is region B but i have all regions player so i bought the U.K. blu-ray anyway
and here's my review of it
the 4k HD transfer studio canal gave the film looks incredible, No grain or Dirt and the picture colour has been fixed aswell
much better quality than the previous Lionsgate & studio canal release from years ago
the only catch is the transfer is 4k upscale quality so you need a 4k player & 4k HD TV to play the format
otherwise the picture quality will look like standard 1080p transfer when you play the Disc
the sound quality is the same 5.1 master audio mix which sounds excellent
there's also new extras aswell, new interview with Director Russell Mulcahy & Christopher Lambert
plus the feature length making of Documentary from the Immortal edition blu-ray
plus the HD Deleted scenes & the Directors Audio commentary plus other extras carried over to this new 30th anniversary
i've also researched the Lionsgate reissue coming out in september
and i can tell you it will have the exact same content as the U.K. studio canal blu-ray
meaning the same 4k HD transfer & same extras the only difference is the region code actually
but if you have all regions player then it won't matter which blu-ray version you get
i can say this new 30th anniversary blu-ray is the best version to get of Highlander
5 stars for it based on incredible 4k HD transfer & old & new extras",1469577600,22,1744,4.610932475884244

It was one of those films that took your breath away with the fight scenes and unknown immortals among us, as well as outstanding acting and majestic scenery. Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery were perfectly cast in this as Highlander Connor MacLeod and his mentor Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez, respectively. Although the plot is not overly complicated, the path MacLeod must take to, basically, save humanity is a fun - yet bloody - ride. The soundtrack music by Queen is a plus. This BluRay Director's Cut is nice to have in my library if for no other reason than to get nostalgic and plop it in my player. had I rated it in 1986 it may have been a 5 but in today's universe with all that has come out since I give it a 4, which IMO is still strong.",1466035200,,823,4.35064935064935
40014,3,0782008372,"I hadn't seen this movie for a long time, and I had a generally positive memory of it, but watching it again I couldn't ignore the fact that it isn't very good. It has a very unusual and interesting fantasy premise, which is undoubtedly what made it into a ""cult classic"". But the execution is not very good.

You basically have to completely shut off your brain and not think about it, because so much of it is ridiculous and/or makes no sense. One example: at the start of the movie, McCleod is arrested at a murder scene. He resists arrest, and then punches a cop while being interrogated...and then they let him go. Another: an ex-marine driving around NYC with a car full of machine guns sees two immortals fighting. He fills the bad guy full of holes with an Uzi, then he's impaled by a sword and thrown across the alley with it, slamming into a brick wall. He survives. That kind of stuff happens throughout the movie. They seem to have not even been trying to make it believable.

The acting is not great, and the story is not great. The whole movie is basically exposition, told through repeated flashbacks. The special effects, especially the lightning that goes with ""the quickening"" are bad and low budget, even for the time the movie was made.

On the positive side, there is a lot of very impressive scenery and some interesting visuals and camera work. The fight scenes are good enough. And the whole concept is imaginative enough, and the tone light enough, that you don't end up totally hating it. But I did end up feeling like I wasted my time.",1465776000,,1562,4.512367491166078

Unlike some on here I started off my Highlander fandom with the TV series to me that will now and forever be the best version of the Highlander mythos, and if you haven't watched the show last time I checked a user on Youtube had uploaded the whole thing so do yourself a favor and watch it, particularly seasons 2-5.  I enjoy element of the films, the first film absolutely nothing can touch it.  Hands down the best of the movies.  The main criticism I have of this Blu Ray is picture and sound really isn't all that superior to the DVD.  I was so excited when I first got this because of the extra scenes and because I would finally be able to see the film in all its Hi Def glory.  But man was I disappointed, the transfer just plain sucks.  Its too bad Highlander isn't more popular so that fans can actually have someone go in and give us a real hi def treatment.  The concept for the franchise is awesome, immortals, sword fighting, flash backs to historical times to other times in said immortals lives which connect to modern day.  The how premises is a mix of fantasy, sci fi, and action adventure.  But unfortunately it really has gotten plagued by the cult treatment, B writing, B production, B acting....",1465516800,,1327,4.357723577235772

(Connery's a lot of things, Hispanic?  No.)

The story is simplistic yet cautious.  MacLeod must battle other Immortals who which to cash in on his immortality.  A simple beheading will kill the opponent and the victorious receives the power.

Just put in a fantastic star and bring back a dead character only just kill the character again without a thought.  Honestly felt sorry for Sean Connory on even being in the movie.

40217,5,0782008372,"Like MacLeod and the Kurgan always say "" There can be only one"", the same should be said about Highlander. A movie like this cannot have sequels perhaps prequels but not sequels. Hollywood should have made a movie about the Kurgan's life story instead of Highlander 2. Watching Highlander the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray was great entertainment. One of those cult classics I can watch many times along with movies like Escape From New York and Flash Gordon. The Kurgan has to be one of my top ten villains on the big screen along with Darth Vader and General Zod. When I saw this movie at a retail store for only five dollars, it was a nice find.

40243,4,0782008372,"This movie doesn't have the best writing or worldbuilding, but it stands out on its own solely because of the circumstances that have created it. Highlander, like Flash Gordon circa 1980, have benefited from showcasing one of the biggest rock bands in the world, Queen, with a whole soundtrack recorded for use in the film. Highlander isn't as flashy or over the top as Flash Gordon is, no. More or less, it introduces us to men that actively engage in swordplay with each other to the point of killing one another. We eventually see flashbacks to another life, another time in the presence of one Connor MacLeod. The story follows Connor's perspective, showing us that he was a Highlander of 16th Century Scotland. He is eventually killed, and then awakens. It is let out that he is an immortal, along with a handful of others in the world, and they eventually seek each other by a great pull to a faraway land to compete...until only one remains.

The movie is a cult classic, showing us the existence of Christopher Lambert as Connor, along with Sean Connery in his prime as a fellow Immortal mentor, and Clancy Brown as a fierce and violent Immortal. These three men are embroiled in the story of the conflict, eventually coming to a head...figuratively.

The visual and audio quality of the movie is slightly better than the DVD, but Director's Cut footage does add in a couple of scenes that offer some cohesion to certain plot holes.

Overall, the movie is for fantasy buffs, who love character actors and their work, and Queen adding their songwork to the story.",1443916800,10,1570,4.7226277372262775

On a scale for 1-4 for DVD - video quality was a solid 3. (Definitely wasn't Superbit Quality). Extremely grainy...but i have to think they took the 70mm print and zoomed it to 1.85 because it has that ""blown up"" look about it.  (Those of you who would be concerned about this will know what i mean).
The original ""scope"" was 1.85:1.  This was presented as such.  There was a 70mm print, too.. but that's not included here sadly. (The Blu-ray didn't have it either.)
It was Enhanced Widescreen 16.9
Original Audio was simply Dolby Surround, but there was a special 6 track for the 70mm print created.  This disc includes the DTS-ES Discrete 6.1 coding! - Along with DD-EX  (it was 'gimmicky' by today's standard, but awesome to have been included... the .1 effects track (bass) was WAAAYYY overboosted, but it was cool throwback to the early days of DVD audio encoding :)  [the blu-ray only hosted DTS_HD 5.1 - too bad.)

40297,2,0782008372,"Those scenes cut from the original theatrical release were left out for a reason: they do nothing to advance the story.  The rule of thumb when editing a written story--and should be for films as well--is cut out anything that doesn't help to move the story along.  Those deleted scenes should be left in the special features category where they belong and not re-added to the film and in this case it bogs things down, drags out scenes longer than they need to be,  more or less the same affect as trying to sail a boat that someone forgot to pull the anchor up.
Another problem, at least with my copy, is the audio is horrible.  Sound effects and sound track are blaringly loud while we could hardly understand the dialog at all. In some scenes the actors sounded as if their mouths were stuffed with cotton balls.  I was constantly adjusting the volume in an effort to hear what the actors were saying and to keep from being blasted out the front window by the soundtrack.
Most disappointing of all is my fiance had never seen it and I had been going on about what a great movie this was.  So I felt bit embarrassed having crowed about this film the way I did only to see her losing interest less than half way through. But who could blame her?  Between the story being bogged down by pointless re-added scenes and the horrible audio it was barely holding my attention as well.

40320,5,0782008372,"Works on my US player perfectly. I like the supplementary material and the picture and sound quality are the best for this film I've ever seen. I imagine this is what it looked like in theaters in 1986.

Sadly, the ""Deleted scenes"" are not complete as some of the footage has been lost (such as a fight between Immortals in an office building that's mentioned in the script but was removed before the theatrical release), but that's hardly a mark against this release since the footage is not known to exist. However some deleted scenes, some in black and white and without sound, have been added as a bonus reel you can watch separately from the movie. I had not seen the other supplementary materials before either, so if all you've seen is the ""Immortal Edition"" on DVD, this is worth getting and has a bit more than the US release, supposedly.

The actual feature is the ""director's cut"" with the additional scenes missing added back in from the various versions... with two small exceptions: there is a scene where the detective watching Connor MacLeod's house burns his mouth on some hot coffee -- which was only in the US release and made no sense because the context - a drunken party with some Immortals the night before - was found only in some lost deleted footage; and a quick voice-over of Connor saying ""I want to go home"" shortly before he returns to Scotland near the end (again only in the US release). Otherwise everything is here. And I'm happy to say, that some extra sound effects that were not in any previous version that were ADDED to the first DVD release (basically ""buzz"" sound effects of Immortals detecting one another to mimic that effect from the 90's TV series) are no longer present. I felt those additions were unnecessary and I'm glad they're removed.

If you loved the original Highlander, you'll love this edition. For everyone else, you'll probably wonder what all the fuss is about. Just some hokey 80's action movie about guys hacking each other with swords in New York / Scotland and a soundtrack by Queen? I disagree!",1430611200,,2059,4.666666666666667

40349,5,0782008372,"This is the first of a series of films, and a television show franchise that I absolutely love and swear by.

  This introduction movie is very dated but also in my view an amazing science fiction, action adventure yarn about lone warriors of the past who are immortal unless one of them slices off their head in a duel stealing their power.  Conner McCloud of the Highlander McCloud clan (French actor Christopher Lambert of 90's Martial Arts films like ""Mortal Kombat"" & ""The Hunted"") is the courageous gallant hero who was born in the ""Brave Heart"" era, and runs into this ""Star Wars"" like super soldier ""Dark Lord"" warrior named ""The Kuergan"" who impales him during a battle.  He awakens to find out he cannot die easily, and doesn't age only to be exiled from his native village as an outcast.  This villain resembles a rougher, lest refined, crude, and a bit more savage version of ""Darth Vader"" as the primary antagonist.

 Conner realizes he also doesn't age past 30 or 40, so when he interacts with mortal human beings they all get older while he remains the same age as the years go by, pretending to be an ancestor of his former identity through the ages.  He finds a Scottish wife who excepts him, then luckily for him eventually runs into another being like himself in an older and charming soldier of fortune who is older then Jesus Christ himself, being a man from the ancient past played by another Scotsman Sean Connery.

 Connery teaches him some Martial Arts and sword play tricks to help train him for the ultimate future battle against the Dark Warrior ""The Kurgan"" himself, because the origins and code of all Immortal Soldiers is explained in detail by Connery explaining that his enemy will always try to stalk him and hunt him down.

The ""Quickening"" is also this bizarre ""Star Wars"" like power that each Immortal possess, and wants to take from another. & that years later onward there will be a ""gathering"" of fighters who will try to kill each other to become the last man standing proclaiming, ""There can be only one.""

 We learn from the sequels that Conner McCloud learns more about the Martial Arts, and obtains his own ""Samurai"" sword because he sought out a Ninja Master & sorcerer in Feudal Japan.

 Both the late Gene Siskel and the late Roger Ebert had given this movie thumbs down, and did not seem to care for it's swashbuckling ""Pirate"" or ""Knight"" theme of men in the present fighting each other as if they still still lived 800 years in the past.  Too much fencing for their tastes.  For what ever reason they did not see the treasure of science fiction fantasy that I had seen in this franchise that can only be compared with George Lucas's ""Star Wars"", Arnold's ""Conan the Barbarian"", and a few other movie franchises that from the time I was very young and still to this very day absolutely love.

 This film seemed to be written as a one movie show, because that is how the plot developed and ended but the theme of this franchise by it's own nature really demanded sequels and also a television show which I had also really enjoyed, and found to be almost as great as the movies.

  This ""Director's Cut"" version is excellent because we see a bit more detail and some added in deleted scenes taken out of the theater release way back in the 80's.

 I have nothing but awesome and inspiring things to say about this franchise, for it is an epic masterpiece for ages around 14 and up. I hope there will be better material and more of this in the near future because the 5th movie was pretty darn bad.  A+ & thumbs way up for the ""Highlander"".",1427500800,,3587,4.539657853810264

40409,4,0782008372,"I love Highlander.  I watched this movie as a kid, loved the series, and even went to watch the lackluster sequels.  Highlander has a special place in my heart.  That being said, Highlander is very odd to talk about in terms of quality.

First off, the story is great.  One of the things I always say about a good sci fi/fantasy tale is that it's wrapped in mythology that the creators only touch on.  That's why Highlander is great.  Sure there are flashbacks.  But one of the things that keep viewers coming back to Highlander was where did these immortals come from?  What about the rest of their stories?  That's really why the first one works and the rest of the movies fail.  It's wrapped in mythology only giving us snippets about the past.

So that being said, what about the movie?  Well it has a lot of great elements.  The leads are great in their roles.  I'll never say either Christopher Lambert or Clancy Brown are the best actors ever, but Lambert's nondescript accent works as a man who has lived forever and everywhere.  Clancy Brown is the most awesome villain ever as the Kurigan.  Troubling as it is, the scene in the church where the Kurigan says, ""Forgive me father, I am a worm,"" encapsulates the pure evil of this character.  And Sean Connery is just great.

The story works because it's a classic tale of good and evil.  It's sprinkled with some neat camera work, due in no small part to the fact that Russel Mulchay was a graduate of music video directing.  The segues between the flashbacks and present day are perfect and became a hallmark of all future incarnations of Highlander.  Then there's the music of Queen, cool sword fighting, and great one liners like, ""It's a kind of magic,"" and, ""There can be only one!""

So why do I reduce the review by one star.  Well, with all that's great, it's hard to ignore the campiness of the movie and the fact that it has some really bad dialogue and acting in it.  Leads aside, the supporting players leave much to be desired.  The whole police was ripped from Police Squad.  There's a helicopter scene where MacLeod and the Kurigan leave from a sword fight and the police in the helicopter just say, ""Hey. Come back here.""  It's comical.  The unintentional camp factor is great for a laugh, but does rob from some of the great aspects of the movie.  It's a small enough complaint that it doesn't ruin the replay value.  Though a warning to new viewers: It can seem a little dated at times.

Extras on the Blu Ray are hold overs from the DVD.  The HD transfer is great.  My only gripe is there are a set of slideshow extras detailing facts about production.  One of the little snippets contained photos and info about footage that had been destroyed. Why they didn't add this info to the bluray is beyond me.  I guess you can google it.

That being said.  Pick this up!  Watch the Highlander series!  Stay away from the movies, especially Highlander 2.  Buy Queen's ""A Kind of Magic"" album.  All great stuff.  And remember, there can be only one!  Had to say it...",1422403200,2,3035,4.489908256880734

On the down side, I really disliked the music in the Madison Square gardens parking structure scene. It's totally out of place. Just gratuitous music. Kind of that way throughout the movie. Not like someone wrote a score that enhanced the scenes. It's really irritating.

40463,4,0782008372,"For 5 bucks on Blu-ray, this is a helluva good time.  The picture is nice and bright, although a bit grainy at times (what can you do? it's close to 30 years old).  The sound is super-sharp, highlighting both the superb songs of Queen and the odd accents of the lead actors (Sean Connery is Spanish? OK...).  The MTV nature of the filming (quick cuts, close-ups, fish-eye lenses, low dolly shots) may have been innovative for the time, but are laughable 30 years later.  The highlights are the epic sword-fights and the breathtaking views of Scotland.  I am seriously planning a trip to Scotland based on the scenery.
I bought this as a Queen completist and was a bit disappointed with how much the songs were cut up.  The most featured song, ""Who Wants to Live Forever?"" is definitely the weakest Queen tune here.  We get a snippet of the great ""Princes of the Universe"" during the opening credits, a dash of heavy rocking in ""Gimme the Prize"" while Kurgan is driving, and a bit of the hit ""Hammer to Fall"" on a car radio.  We also get a sparse (most of the background vocals missing) and shortened version of ""It's a Kind of Magic"" during the credits.  It made me want to go listen to Queen's album (A Kind of Magic) with the full length studio versions of these songs. For a better marriage of Queen and Hollywood, I'll revisit Flash Gordon.
Again, for 5 bucks, I'd do it all over again.",1418428800,2,1390,4.462450592885376

The storylline- Well, it's cheesy. It's a fantasy about an immortal guy who eventually must fight to survive as there can only be one (immortal). There are some universal points about love and loss that will touch a nerve though.

The acting- Also pretty cheesy, but consider what they've got to work with. Sean Connery is a doll baby in this. Quite sexy. Lambert, I don't know. He's in his element, but he's a little weird in everything. Th Kurgan, I think this is his finest film. He's a horrifying villain. He goes a long way in making this a cult classic.

The music- TO DIE FOR. If anyone could provide a modern sound track for scenes set in medieval times it's Queen. :)

Despite all that, the movie somehow hangs together in a very entertaining and timeless way. I can't believe this is almost 30 years old and people are still watching it. It's more than just a good vs. evil story. You're not just rooting for the downfall of the villain, you are hoping that LOVE wins.

40659,5,0782008372,"Where do I begin? Highlander is one of my all-time favorite movies. It combined fantasy, action, suspense, love, and dramatic settings with really cool special effects (for the time period it was made). Christopher Lambert is witty and funny as the immortal Highlander, Connor MacLeod. Sean Connery was superb as MacLeod's mentor Juan Ramirez. Clancy Brown was an awesome super villain as the Kurgan (I honestly don't believe there's been a villain as evil as the Kurgan - hey, even Darth Vader was good once!).

The flashbacks are terrific time capsules of Connor MacLeod's life. From his bonny Heather to the humorous encounter with a noble on Boston Common resulting in a duel to the death for calling his wife a ""bloated warthog"", MacLeod seemed to have been everywhere and done everything. The epic battle between MacLeod and the Kurgan for the prize are not only exciting, but filled with suspense.

My only regret was the movie was originally designed as a stand alone movie and allowed no room for sequels. The prize is won at the end. That's it. The gathering is over.

Since then, the producers of the show made two terrible attempts at cashing in with sequels which led to the embarrassing Highlander 2 and the rip-off Highlander 3.

They made a great TV series, but had to say, ""This is a different universe then the movies"" which completely ignores the sequels and makes vague references to Connor's encounter with the Kurgan.

Still, even with no opportunity to continue the story or delve deeper into the history of the immortals (which is what made Highlander:The Series so good), this was a superb movie that is a must own for any fan of science fiction, fantasy, or action.",1396915200,2,1691,4.817241379310345

Who cannot help but fantasize about the gift of immortality and the inevitable knowledge it brings?  However, I was certainly disappointed with this this film.

It's so 80's and clich.  The only thing it's missing is breakdancing by 400 year old immortals.  The production quality is poor, but I suppose it's well before the age of big budget films.  I just feel there is far more that could have been done with character development or historical value.  Even the combat scenes are a joke!  There are fireworks ever time one of their swords touched metal.  Maybe we were all coked up idiots in the 80s and thought this kind of nonsense was cool.  It doesn't seem that way to me now.

It's a cool idea for a story, but it's dated and executed poorly by 2013 standards.  I suppose that it's destined to be resurrected with modern cinematography.  Please, please, just don't have Michael Bay involved and overdo the CGI.  The hook is the character and his evolution within and with mankind through the ages.

40919,5,0782008372,"While there were many others that followed, this is the orginial and I'm glad I have the Director's Cut..because it has many of the scenes that were left out. In some there would have been no difference, but in others, it will explain a few things. Christopher Lambert is great as McCloud and it should have been the only movie in this series. It answered just about all the questions you needed and although it did leave a few unanswered, so what...Not everything has to have an answer, it just is. And this is the way it should have ended. I never did like the sequel to it since it was so far away from the message and tried to answer questions that had never been asked or really needed. This about a man who has learned he is immortal in a time when sorcery, witchcraft and magic was as much a belief as was christianity....of course when he is struck down in battle and is near death, he is believed to be cursed and almost burned if not for a friend that helps him escape his clan.
He is still unsure what he is since he has never met anyone like him until Sean Connery comes into his life and Conner experiences his first ""Quickening"" which is what happens when 2 immortals meet.

He finally learns to live with his 'curse', and his mentor teaches him how to fight, survive if necessary in a what is now going to be a fight for his immortal life because ""there can be only one"". And nothing in this unknown history of immortals says they are all good..as in the life of all humans, there are those that are truely evil and will stop at nothing to be the one to recieve the final gift.

Of course he has to leave those he loves behind because inevitably they will grow old and he will continue. His one true love died many years ago and he still honors her on her birthday as he promised. He is not cold, callaused or uncaring as his opponent  and tries hard not to interfere in the affairs of mortals. It is however impossible to do and although he has tried to keep himself free of relationships, it is hard for him to do,because although he is immortal, he is still very human with human feelings and emotions.  But he is the Highlandeer and the last...he is Conner McCloud and they should have left it at that.",1357776000,2,2221,4.280952380952381

The romantic sides in this movie are very rewarding additions to it. Its very dreamy and i did find myself wanting to mentally go tjere again many times. Even now.
Thats all i have to say. If you want to know more, then buy the movie and get your popcorn ready and just enjoy it!  You want be sorry in my books!
I want to add that the sweet scenes with first love were memorable and the sexy intimate scenes with second love made me blush! Even in my dreams.

Connor Macleod [Christopher Lambert, in what is very easily his best performance to date], a centuries-old immortal in present-day New York, meets up with his arch nemesis The Kurgan [Clancy Brown, who steals the show in every scene he appears in] to do battle in order to finally claim The Prize. This movie is a joy to watch for many reasons: The interesting story, The beautiful scottish scenery in the flashback scenes, The entertaining swordfights [especially the duel between Connor and The Kurgan in the finale], The awesome Queen songs which are heard all throughout the movie, and the great performances by the cast. Although Christopher Lambert is not a good actor and not a good choice for a leading man, He somehow is able to make his presence work in this movie [Despite the fact that he's obviously a french man playing a scottish character] and he actually makes Connor a very likeable character but it is Sean Connery as Connor's mentor Ramirez and Clancy Brown as the treacherous Kurgan who are the real stars of this movie as they both immediately take charge of any scenes either of them appear in. Over the years, this movie has become a bonafide cult classic and i'd reccomend this movie to anybody who likes fantasy films, action films, and sword films. Note: There are a few differing versions of this movie out there with extra footage that's normally not seen in some prints of this movie so choose wisely when purchasing this movie on DVD or Blu-Ray.

One day their are called to do battle in a far away land until their is only one remains, and the winner gets supreme knowledge and an unkown power which can spell doom if it were to fall in the wrong hands. So Connor Mcleod (played by Christopher Lambert) is fighting his greatest challenge. The Kurgan, an immortal Connor met in the 1500's who activated Connor's immortality.

That said, I found this Blu-ray disc to be profoundly disappointing. The ""HD"" quality of image reproduction vacillates between 2 completely undesirable extremes. The rendering of at least half of the movie is so grainy that to compare it to streaming a youtube video over a dial-up connection would still leave it wanting. At other times, the resolution is so crisp that the scar make-up on the Kurgan looks about as convincing as fake vomit from a strip mall novelty shop.

One other female character: the prostitute who shows up at the antagonist's hotel room for the purpose of using ""kinky"" as a codeword for evil.

This film is pretty good, from the swordfighting to the musical score by the always reliable Michael Kamen. The acting, from Christopher Lambert to Sean Connery, is also excellent. I recommend it.

That's not to say it's without allure - in fact, the terribly dated references to the era's pop culture and filmmaking techniques are half the fun of sitting down with it today. The world was a completely different place thirty years ago, and though we're doing so through a set of decidedly rose-tinted goggles, it's fun to look back on it in this way. Plus, buried beneath the film's sillier superficial aspects is a startlingly bright, thoughtful basic plot line dealing with love, loss and the kind of cold, calm emotional distance that any combination of the two will inevitable produce. A pity those deeper, more interesting developments don't enjoy half the investigation they probably deserve, but perhaps that's why the film fueled so many sequels.

41000,5,0782008372,"Since first watching Highlander in the mid nineteen-eighties much has been released on the theme. I rate this film as the best of them all still. It is a fantasy drama of love and loss, and good against evil that is set firmly with the choice of the individual over anything else.
It is violent and it is emotionally provocative in reference to the journey of Connor MacLeod, the main character, from his birth in the Middle Ages in Scotland to the present day, albeit almost thirty years ago now. He is immortal hence his longevity, one of a number of immortals born throughout history around the globe. They are magical creatures and must battle one another with swords until only one remains. The Prize is what they are driven to fight for, yet the true nature of this reward is not revealed to them.
Two or so hours in one movie was never long enough to do the story complete justice but it was popular enough for two sequels and other slants the franchise took in terms of television and animation.
Forgive me for saying this, but for me in the end there can be only one, and that is the original Highlander movie. This Director's Cut version, no pun intended I'm sure, is faithful to the original release of the film and may well end up being the definitive version in time, though at only six minutes of extra footage it is possibly not for anyone other than the die hard fan.

41006,4,0782008372,"I made a serious mistake in the original review. I've re-written it to correct that mistake.

I complained that, in dark and/or grainy scenes, the image often broke up into a ""screen-door"" pattern of square blocks. This was true, but it wasn't due to a bad transfer.

My Pioneer plasma display has a remarkable Sharpness control. You can turn it all the way up to 11 (15, actually), and it does //nothing// but sharpen the picture -- no overshoot or ringing, no outlining, nothing. It does //exactly// what it's supposed to do, without introducing side-effects. I therefore leave it turned all the way up.

The problem is that some films (such as ""Highlander"") are taken from grainy or noisy sources. When the sharpness is turned up, the image's macrocells (look it up) become visible. This is the effect I was seeing. Reducing the Sharpness setting to a bit below the display's default returned the macrocells to invisibility.

My apologies to the publisher, and to anyone who decided not to purchase the Blu-ray edition. Feel free to do so.

This ""director's cut"" is the best version of ""Highlander"" I've seen. Earlier versions are missing important scenes and/or have confusing continuity. I wish I could give the film five stars, but it has problems. *

The script lacks subtlety and injects humor where it doesn't belong. ** It largely ignores the very real likelihood of immortals becoming chronically depressed and, shall we say, farbisseneh. *** The fight between Ramirez (Sean Connery in a role he obviously enjoys) and The Kurgan is so implausible and overwrought that it verges on the campy. (Were Scottish buildings /that/ badly constructed?)

The animated effects are strictly for the birds -- cheap, cheap, cheap -- and the make-up even cheaper. When the decrepit Heather is about to die in McLeod's arms, the only way we know she's old is that she's wearing an off-white fright wig. Her makeup comprises darkish circles under the eyes and off-color rouge. The budget apparently didn't justify a bottle of rubber cement to wrinkle her face.

The sound quality, of both dialog and music, is poor, probably from a print's soundtrack, rather than the magnetic masters. The transfer might just as well have been compressed Dolby Digital. Queen's songs add exactly nothing, and notably detract from the mood.

Russell Mulcahy is an excellent director of action sequences, but the film's overall tone is uncomfortably reminiscent of -- yes, ""The Terminator"". I doubt there was any conscious copying, but one might very well believe ""Highlander"" was directed by James Cameron on an off day. Oddly, the principal characters of both films are named ""Connor"".

Despite these qualifications, ""Highlander"" is a generally entertaining film, even for a non-fanboy such as myself. (The TV series was markedly superior, but that's another issue.)

* On a four-star scale, I'd give it 2.5. Unfortunately, Amazon's 3-star rating is a negative rating, and ""Highlander"" is good enough not to deserve it.

** It's not clear whether the police officer asking McLeod if he's an ""antique dealer"" is meant to be funny. (The correct term is ""antiques"".) McLeod is, of course, a living antique.

*** At the end we're told (rather than shown) McLeod has acquired powers that would enable him to help humanity. This might have made a superior sequel that didn't repeat the original.",1314489600,2,3367,5.023339317773788

When the situation calls for it, he can assume an extremely menacing visage--the eyes under his prominent brow ridge glowering and mysterious.  His look is otherworldly--as is appropriate.  But he can turn off this threatening appearance as well and be an amiable friend or loving husband.  I don't know about you, but I'm tired of movies where the villain upstages the hero.

For example, many others loved the Queen soundtrack.  I found it way of mark.  Half the movie took place in the Scottish highlands, and the movie would have came across better with Celtic folk music instead.  As for the swordplay, it is slow and does not compare to that found in Rob Roy, Braveheart, or the various Three Musketeer incarnations.

It is fantasy with great acting and a fun story, the confrontation of good and bad immortals and what it will mean for humanity.  It is right along the lines of Star Trek scenes, where if you are a bit sentimental and can let yourself get lost in it, it is great while it lasts.  Even after 25 years, I can say that stands the test of time, in particular because of the warm role of Connery, the reluctant hero (Lambert), and the lonely idealist police chick.  The bad guy is also a wonderful evocation of chaos, the other path that humanity could go down.  Now, my kids enjoy it too, though it is a bit gory for them.

My criticism is that the blu-ray version that I got - the one with the word in the cover, not the 2-disk edition - is not any better as a print than a normal DVD, with the exception of a few choice panoramic scenes; otherwise, it is surprisingly grainy, truly inferior for blu-ray format.

My biggest complaint is the picture and sound... Now don't get me wrong, this is an incredible improvement over my VHS copy of the Director's Cut but I am moderately disappointed in the video transfer... Extremely grainy video in the scenes with low lighting (so most of the movie right?) but the flashbacks are much crisper/clean. The sound isn't much better. Definitely an improvement over my VHS copy but not up to par with this generation of Blu-Ray releases...

41068,5,0782008372,"HIGHLANDER (1986) is one of my personal favorite flicks! Don't care that it's not really a FILM. But it's definitely a MOVIE experience! Trapped (for better or worse) in the 80s, HIGHLANDER is one of the very few movies that I've ever seen that has an absolutely outlandish premise, but pulls it off with total confidence, competence, and flair! The movie pulls you in from the start, with a rocking song by music group Queen (which supplied all the songs for the movie) and introduces us to the title character Connor MacLeod, the Highlander, played with strong conviction by Frenchman Christopher Lambert. The opening swordfight sequence between MacLeod and his first foe Fasil in the Madison Square Garden garage is a cool, fast-paced scene. Then the movie flashes back to 16th century Scotland where we find that MacLeod is actually immortal and the only way he can die is by beheading.

Flashback scenes show that in the 16th century, MacLeod was trained by another immortal, the flamboyant Spaniard Ramirez (played with scene-stealing flair by the legendary Sean Connery). The mentorship scenes between MacLeod and Ramirez have a sweep and grandeur that is rarely portrayed in films anymore, at least not in such a heartfelt, unassuming way. MacLeod also outlives his first wife Heather (sexy, sweet Beatie Edney). In flashback, we are also introduced to the evil immortal Kurgan (played by Clancy Brown in brilliantly unapologetic, energetic performance), who is out to be the last immortal to win The Prize.

In the present day, MacLeod meets police forensics expert Brenda (fiery and luscious Roxanne Hart), whose avocation is studying and writing books on ancient swords. She's interested in MacLeod's sword, which she found remnants of in the Garden lot while the police were investigating the aftermath of the MacLeod-Fasil fight. MacLeod and Brenda develop a strong attraction to each other and Brenda's investigation leads her to find out of MacLeod's immortality and she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, Kurgan seeks out Macleod in present-day New York to battle for The Prize.

The movie's star Lambert does a great job of conveying MacLeod's eternal dread of living a life of loneliness; he is detached and melancholy, but still resilient, forthright and strong. Which makes the ending all the more satisfying. Another big selling point of HIGHLANDER is it's on-location cinematography (the luscious Scottish highlands countered with the gritty New York atmosphere and locales), giving the fantasy a realistic appeal. This, interspersed with the fantastic Queen music and fast-paced, no-nonsense, yet involving storytelling makes HIGHLANDER an 80s keeper!

Some of these scenes have horrible grain, are fuzzy, bad contrast, and bad color. Then other scenes look amazingly great, what you expect a Blu-Ray to look like. The picture quality seems to degrade with the darker scenes, which would be expected with the film stocks in use when Highlander was originally filmed. But this would not explain picture quality so bad that it is worse than the VHS version of the movie.

More should have been done to clean up the film in the transfer to Blu-Ray. While watching the movie I was constantly distracted by the changes in picture quality. It was like watching a 1080p high definition Blu-Ray one second and watching my first TV set (with rabbit ears) the next. This should have been a 5 star review but someone decided to get cheap in mastering this version of the film to Blu-Ray.",1290297600,4,1392,4.724279835390947
41092,3,0782008372,"MOVIE RATING is 5 stars.

Blu-Ray rating is 3 stars.

This is essentially the British Blu-Ray release, but lacking the original soundtrack and that is a shame. The 5.1 remix has a great deal of reverb added and just doesn't sound as natural as the original stereo surround track, which is on the brit release and virtually uncompressed. Why studios insist on excluding original soundtracks is beyond me, but it is infuriating.

The picture quality on this release is about the same, though possibly a tad more smoothed over. I think they might have used a little bit of grain reduction in scenes. This is comparing the releases on a 72 inch DLP. Both are great, but I give the slight edge to the Brit release.

That Brit BD also has extras that are not on this American version.

This is not a definitive release. It just isn't. However, it is most certainly superior to any American version released on DVD. The UK Amazon has the Brit release so I urge you to buy that one instead. It will play in American BD players. Should you not have the extra cash then go ahead and pull the trigger as long as you understand you won't have the sound that the film was intended to have.",1289779200,17,1176,4.4511627906976745

How can you tell?  Because you can tell its stunt doubles and not Lambert or Connery fighting on the cliffs in the Scottish Highlands!  The resolution is that good.

Its much brighter than the other versions as well.  Two full F-Stops brighter would be my guess.

Also,  we Americans finally get a few important deleted scenes that I saw many years ago while in Europe that help tie the story together.  For those who haven't seen it,  lets just say the phrase ""Hey, it's a kind of magic""  will now make sense.

And then there was the infamous series starring Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod (Connor MacLeod's - played by Christopher Lambert -  cousin)... which just shouldn't happen because in the first movie - which I'm supposed to be reviewing - Sean Connery's voice-over AT THE VERY BEGINNING states:

""From the dawn of time we came; moving silently down through the centuries, living many secret lives, struggling to reach the time of the Gathering; when the few who remain will battle to the last. No one has ever known we were among you... until now.""

They are the last two immortals and they have to cut off the other guy's head to get The Prize... Don't look at me like that! I never said the plot entirely made sense!

I am running the disc on a Samsung BD-C5500 Blu-Ray player to an LG 55"" wireless 1080P LCD in a dedicated home theater and ""Highlander"" Blu-Ray is genuinely awful.

Fuzzy, dark, flashing heavy pixellation make this Blu-Ray at times almost unviewable.  Obviously little time was spent in restoring the original and little care was taken with the conversion to Blu-Ray.  For a classic cult movie the studio obviously felt that fans would accept anything that was even marginally viewable.

Now of course I was not too big on picture quality and audio and widescreen ratios but as the years passed my mind changed. The DVD did suck balls despite the THX logo on the front of it. So much for a good transfer. But it was a huge improvement over the theatrical release on videotape. So when I saw the 2-Disc Immortal Edition online and on shelves I decided to have it for myself. I bought this bad boy for only 9 bucks at a Wal-Mart and thankfully Anchor Bay put it out. Now Anchor Bay does a kickass job with their DVD titles and Highlander really comes to life in the Immortal Edition. It does get the THX treatment but with a better quality than Republic's version. Anchor Bay did put out a single-disc version of the film, but come on! I bought the Immortal Edition at Wal-Mart for 9 bucks and the single-disc version was sold for like 15 bucks plus elsewhere. Kind of odd if you ask me. Correct me if I'm wrong, but oh well. Most of the extras do come from the older DVD versions but the Queen CD that comes with the movie is brand new. If you do want to hear all the best songs from the movie's soundtrack buy the Queen Platinum Collection, which is 3 CDs.

He's not much good with actors either, constantly spinning off into clumsy broad comedy that undermines any threat or momentum, with Clancy Brown's evil Kurgan the main casualty as he is reduced to a tiresomely comical punk rocker. It may be the best of the series, but it's a long way from being even nearly as good as it could and should have been.

The fights seem tame to todays standards, but then again there is more to this movie than the fights.  Back then it was a 21"" with VHS, today it's 91"" with DVD.

*Great fight scenes.
*Nifty special effects.
*Good story.  There is a lot of excitement, but also a lot of drama.  Very original and interesting.
*Good character development.
*Pretty good acting, even if it seems overdone or corny.

The Bad Things
*It's becoming dated.
*Sound design is terrible.  Some parts are very low and other parts are too loud.
*A lot happens, and can be a little tedious to get through.

This turned out better than I thought.  It is very engaging, with slick photography, fancy special effects, and cool fight scenes.

Truth be told, Highlander is not the best film in the world...but it's a ""guilty pleasure"" film for me, dating back to my grad school days in Kingston, at Queen's University.

So, as we were shopping around in Hong Kong a few days ago, I spotted this Video CD of the film, and picked it up, for the price of 9 HKD (about $1.25 Canadian or US), as you can see from the sticker price. My wife had never seen the movie, and I hadn't seen it since the late 90's, and I'd never experiences VCD video quality, so I figured it was a worthwhile investment, all 'round.

The film's plot is choppier than I remembered it, with less in the way of character development, especially as it relates to the modern-day love story. The special effects relating to the Quickening weren't as elaborate as they were in Highlander: The Series a few years later, either. But, it was an entertaining watch...and the love story in the past, with Heather, is handled in a touching fashion.

VCD quality is about the same as we would used to get on videotape, when recording TV programs...definitely not DVD quality.",1203120000,3,1115,4.5049504950495045

41203,1,0782008372,"There are cult movies that have something special about them but are just not mainstream, and then there are cult movies that are utterly awful but that some group of people loves anyway. Highlander is the second type.

Highlander creates a great fantasy scenario. An unexplained, even among its members, group of immortals is born on Earth over the ages. They have to cut off each other's heads in attempt to be the last one standing, at which point the last one will receive some sort of great prize. Interesting issues of their (semi) immortality are touched upon, such as what it's like to be with a partner and watch them grow old and die without them.

Despite the interesting premise, the real problem is three-fold: 80's cheese dogging every inch of the film when they are in the ""current"" day period fighting, throw away acting, sloppy set-ups for action premises, particularly the last part of the film where a relationship starts out of nowhere. It just doesn't stand up as a good film, and as I watched it I either laughed at how bad it was or kept wondering if I should just shut off and stop the terrible waste of time.",1186704000,6,1133,4.5763546798029555

My son and I who is 11 laughed our heads off. The sword fighting scenes were unbelievable, poorly choreographed, sparking like the blades were made out of flint. How exactly does a sword knock down a castle wall in the fight sequence of Remirez and the Kurgan.

41205,5,0782008372,"1986's ""Highlander"" is a good science fiction movie with an exceptionally intriguing concept for a storyline, that a race of immortals live among us and are battling to the last man for an unnamed prize. The concept fueled three big screen sequels and at least two TV series. This is the movie that started it all.

The movie proceeds along parallel story arcs. In one, an antique dealer named Nash, played by Christopher Lambert, battles a series of immortal opponents in modern day New York, while attracting the attention of a curious female police scientist named Brenda (played by Roxanne Hart).

In the second story arc, a Scots Highlander named Connor MacLeod (also played by Lambert) who, after being badly wounded in battle in 1536, discovers that he is immortal. Connor is sought out by an even older immortal named Ramirez (perfectly played by Sean Connery) who teaches him how to fight and how to avoid losing his head to another immortal. Ramirez prepares Connor for the necessarily lonely life he will have, outliving the mortal humans around him. Ramirez also prepares him for an eventual rematch with Kurgan, the evil seven-foot giant immortal who first wounded Connor in battle.

The two story arcs will come together in New York City in the present. Nash, as Connor now calls himself, finds himself falling in love with Brenda just as his old nemesis Kurgan arrives for ""the Gathering"", the final battle of immortals. Connor and Kurgan (played with snarling over-the-top menace by Clancy Brown) will maneuver for a final confrontation that only one of them can survive.

""Highlander"" was strapped by a small budget that limited production values and special effects, but the producers more than made up for this with beautiful location shooting in Western Scotland and New York City, a magnificent score by QUEEN, and some well-staged action sequences. The interaction between Macleod and Ramirez is priceless, as Ramirez imparts both fighting skill and friendship to the young Macleod.

This movie is highly recommended as an exceptionally entertaining experience to science fiction fans and to fans of the later versions of this storyline.",1183334400,,2159,5.0875706214689265

41207,5,0782008372,"I must admit that this is one of my favorite movies. I saw this when it first came out and loved it. Just imagine the premise, although some people think it is silly, back in the 80's (when I originally saw it) it was cutting edge, the concept I mean. Connor MacLeod is an immortal, who has lived for centuries, shunned by his village and hunted by some. He has outlived his true love and realizes that his gift (i.e., immortality) is a double edged sword..meaning while he lives forever, those he loves will not. Mentored by Ramirez, played by a dashing Sean Connery, Connor sets forth to simple stay alive and protect his secret. Leap forward to modern day New York an we see MacLeod is wealthy and living life as a recluse. Hunted by those who want his power, attracted to a woman who wants to learn his secret, we learn that other immortals are trying to behead him and receive the ""quickening"" (his immortality and power). Destined to live forever, because he can be killed and yet wake up later, with the exception of beheading of course, Connor sets out to protect his interests, his secret and maybe get the girl. What I think I liked more about the original, than the television series (which was made years later) is that Christopher Lambert has a haunted quality about him that simply takes your breath away. As he roams the Scotland countryside, and takes care of his aging wife, who he loves passionately, you realize that he will be alone forever. Although later sequels were not as good, his eyes (which seem to look into your very soul) will always leave a vivid image of someone who is well troubled and yet hopeful. But what is most powerful about this original is the cinematography...Scotland is absolutely beautiful! So rent it or purchase it, you won't be sorry.",1178582400,3,1784,4.5956112852664575

And who knows what the requirments are for a full digital restoration.  You've got to cut it some slack considering the time and budget it was filmed on.

  I didn't see it in the theatre so I can't make version comparisons but it is just like I remember seeing it on tv as a kid(minus a scene or two).  Its a bit goofy, but its no goofier than any film from that period or any worse quality.

  If you remember it from way when or are another Sean Connery fan, go with it, its worth the couple bucks.  If you've never seen it then don't get it with expectations of it holding up to this years films.  Overall worth what I paid!!",1174521600,4,929,4.1807909604519775

41232,4,0782008372,"There are 4 Highlander Films and this one, is the absolutely best one.

It is a strong story about immortals that have to defeat each other so they can have ""the price"", and the only way to kill each other is to chop of each other's head.

Now the best element of this film is that it's not just about immortals trying to chop each other heads off.

Yes, the beautiful thing of this film is that besides the action and thrills, there is the emotion that the immortals have of having to live forever. Friendship, love, it's all made more dificult because of being immortal in a world where everybody else is mortal. This emotion and feeling is shown perfectly.

Highlander has next to a strong story, a strong cast.

The main character we are following through his life is played by Christopher Lambert, who does a good job portraying the hero of the film. He is helped by Sean Connery's character, who is cast as a Spanish lord (which is a pretty weird casting choice considering Sean Connery is Scottish). But although he is a Spanish Lord with a Scottish accent, it doesn't ruin the fun one bit. Clancy Brown plays one of the best bad guys I've every seen on the screen. He is evil, not merifull and absolutely bad. he also looks the part perfectly, and is frightin gwith his dark voice. Great casting choice.

The locations are great (the movie set in the ancient Scottland and the New York of the 80's, but also at some other great sets), the fightscenes thrilling (Swordfighting with great special effects), the editing of the film has some of the greatest editing moments ever and the music is absolutely right. Michael Kamen has made a great soundtrack for the film. Also, a lot of songs from the famous Queen are in this film. Trust me, seeying an immortal struggle with his being immortal while ""Who wants to live forever"" is played is one of the strongest moviemoments ever that gives you chills over your spine.

So if you want to see a Highlander film: be sure to do it right and watch this one. The others are way weaker than this strong original. It is a perfect thrilling adventure that you will remember and want to watch again. Highlander is enjoyable for 1 viewing, but also for 5 viewings more. You just want to see it again and again.

Enjoy!",1159142400,3,2262,4.48661800486618
41233,5,0782008372,"There's nothing like a good story well told. In a lot of fantasy/action flicks, the audience spends a lot of time trying to figure out what in the world is going on. Highlander keeps the present day action moving at a good pace while allowing for flashbacks that bring viewers up to speed.

The cast plays to tell the story, not to be ""stars."" Sean Connery who is always wonderful to watch plays a secondary but important role as Connor's mentor. Connery's wit and physical presence makes a potentially heavy character come to life.

Christopher Lambert is fine in this role though it seems like it could have been better done by an actor who slipped into the characters skin better. His acting is competent but not entirely satisfying.

A small nuance in the film was set design, make up, and costuming. One thing that drives me crazy in historical films is how CLEAN everyone looks. This product gives you the feeling of really being in 16th century Scotland. Lots of dirty faces, ragged clothing, and matted hair. One film for which you wouldn't want ""Smell-o-vision.""

I also liked casting Roxanne Hart as Connors love interest. She's supposed to be a cop and looks it. She plays the role with a nice balance of curiousity, toughness, and vulnerability. The 1980's poodle hair detracts a little but most actresses in 1980 films had atrocious poodle hair and bad perms.

Connor's nemesis, the 7-foot brute from the steppes of Russia is one of the films best characters. Nasty, brutish, and terrifying with a wicked dark sense of humor. Often times fantasy films take themselves and their mythology too seriously and for that reason come across as ponderous. It's not often you get an evil barbarian with an ironic sense of humor.

Finally, what makes the film one of my favorites is the soundtrack. Queen! The ultimate 70's band. A band that practically defined flamboyance and big hair. With the campiest, most flamboyant lead singer of the decade, Freddy Mercury. For all their goofiness, the members of Queen were solid, accomplished musicians and their music is filled with wit and melodic hooks. Princes of Universe is the perfect sound to open this film.

Add to the mix a killer soundtrack written and performed by Queen and you've got yourself a franchise.

Christopher Lambert plays Connor MacLeod, the Highlander in the role that made him famous and unfortunately typecast him for all time.

Some of the extended scenes in the Madison Square garden are good as well. I particularly like the extened dual scene.  The quality of the film is adequate for DVD, but again being an older film the conversion to DVD has brought out some of the fuzziness, but isn't that just nostalgia. Its better than VHS by far still, although i agree my laserdisc versions are nice.  So this is a good addition for a collection to add some more history and historicalness to the film collection, but not a must get.

41239,3,0782008372,"And that ONE is the original Highlander film. The original film deals with human beings who through some twist of fate are born immortal and must fight to the death with other ""Immortals"" to gain the knowledge and wisdom of the Ages and more importantly mortality - a regular human existence, hence the phrase: ""there can be only one,"" which eventually Conan MacLeod becomes. Overall an interesting premise and the tragedy of it all inability to grow old with someone you love. Always having to pretend to age and then watching everyone around you die while you continue living. Immortality doesn't sound so fun does it?

2) the sequel - (the quickening) It is now 1999, earth is decimated from ozone depletion and an aged Conan MacLeod is no longer the last of his kind when two fellow breathren are dispatched from the planet Zeist to kill him. Zeist??? Zeist??? Where did that come from? Yes all of a sudden Immortals come from a distant galaxy far far away, oh sorry that's another movie. Conan fortunately kills these two bad Immortals and all of a sudden he's young and Immortal again!

Wait a minute remember I told you in the first film, Conan became a regular joe after killing Kurgan, the second to last of his kind. You see the dilemma, after all, the inhabitants of Zeist still existed or else they couldn't have sent anyone to kill Conan. OOPS, it seems Conan is not the last of his kind after all! But then how could he have become mortal after killing the last of his kind and then suddenly became immortal again? After he kills the Zeist Assasins? Zeist was teaming with life and Immortals so what's going on here? In the theatre when I first saw this sequel, I just kept saying to myself ""OH MY GOD."" Later in a Director's cut they explain that the Immortals are not from a planet, but exist somehow outside of time...yea that clears everything up.

3) Third Sequel, okay, here we go again. This was the Highlander movie sequel with Mario Van Peebles that just totally dismissed the second film as if it had never been made. But there's still a problem because in the 3rd film Conan (Lambert), even though during all this time, he has killed every other immortal and has won the prize and is now mortal, Mario (an evil Immortal) along with two other evil Immortals have been frozen in ice.

So how could Conan have become mortal by killing the last of his kind with these three Immortal Popcycles still technically in existence? I mean just because they're frozen, in suspended animation, does that mean they don't count in the grand scheme of things in the Universe?

As far as that other sequel with that wannabe Immortal (Adrian Paul)from the TV series. Don't get me started on the stupidity of that movie!

As far as this edition, the quality of the film is okay, it doesn't appear to have been re-digitized, etcetera. It does come in a nice metal sleeved package, great Queen CD, but no real extras to speak of.

Do yourself a favor, whichever version of Highlander you buy, stay with the original film, pretend the sequels and series don't exist! ""There can be only one!""",1150848000,4,3094,4.594202898550725

  The story of Conner McCleod in the modern day, and his confrontation with a viscious villian from his past to become the one immortal left on Earth.  When one of them has accomplished this, then they will have won the prize.

  Conner's story is told through flashbacks to the past, when he lived in Scotland, and how he was trained by a Spainish-Egyption (yes, it is sort of lame to explain) named Ramierez (played by Sean Connerey!!!).

  Besides showing the swrod trianing aspect, there is also the theme of ""Who wants to live forever"" (supplied by Queen who did the music).  This theme shows that an immortal life is one full of loss as you watch your loved ones die.

  Beyond the touchy-feely emotional themes, this is a great movie full of action and a great 80's vibe (the good kind, if that's possible).

  This immortal edition is not too bad either.  With a fairly decent print of the film on the disc (some graininess that couldn't be avoided), great sound, and a load of extras (three Queen music videos!!!).

Then, little-known director Russell Mulcahy delivered adult audiences what they had been missing, a fantastic tale of immortals locked in an eternal struggle, their goal, to win the coveted 'prize' and live the rest of their lives in peace.

""Highlander"" is the fantasy/sci-fi tale of a Scotsman named Connor Macleod (Christopher Lambert) in modern-day New York.  Connor seems to be an average man who makes an honest living selling antiques, however, all is not as it seems.  Connor Macleod is really hundreds of years old, and when he was in his mid-twenties his clan fought in a battle against a warring clan in Scotland, and during the battle Macleod was fatally wounded and left for dead.  Later, Connor awoke and was driven from his home by his own clan, who believed him to be demonic, and forced to wander the world not knowing how or why he is still alive.  That is until he meets an Immortal named Ramirez (Sean Connery), who teaches him about the ways of the 'Immortals', which Macleod has become, and of the eternal struggle the Immortals are locked in as they strive to gain the 'prize'.  Now, Connor must use all he has learned from Ramirez to defeat an Immortal who has been hunting him through the ages.

""Highlander"" is a fun, well-written and well-acted movie, that gave audiences an interesting mix of the present-day, with flashbacks of the old highlands of Scotland, and the harsh life that was endured in that time.  ""Highlander"" though not too well received by critics, it managed to find a cult following that has grown immensely over the years.  Due to the popularity ""Highlander"" experienced among most audiences, it was no surprise that sequels were soon to follow.  Although, to most fans the sequels were generally inferior to the original, in my opinion, ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"" was a sub-par sequel, but the best sequel is ""Highlander: Endgame"", a sequel that some believe ignores both ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"" and ""Highlander: The Final Dimension"", personally I think it just ignores ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"", because it flows fairly well from ""Highlander: The Final Dimension"".  But regardless of the quality of the sequels, ""Highlander"" is a great movie, and is still as enjoyable today as it was in 1986.

""Highlander"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sexuality.",1126137600,3,2484,4.956626506024096

It has everything one could want; sex, romance, martial arts, swordplay, history (well not quite), mystery, and beheadings.  Christopher Lambert is at his best in this film.  Sean Connery's limited appearance is a great asset as well.

The basic storyline is there are immortals that take other immortals power and lives by cutting off their heads.  Eventually there can be only one and that one will have the prize.",1124755200,2,529,4.822222222222222
41247,5,0782008372,"Highlander is a classic.  I just popped this in the dvd player today and it still looks magnificent after 20 years.  More importantly, the sound quality is great - the sound designers on this movie did an excellent job, and putting this movie on DVD adds power to the viewing experience.  Not to mention Queen's unique killer rock soundtrack which was tailored for the film (a rarity in any movie these days)

In spite of the TV series, animation and sequels - Highlander the movie really stands alone.  Russell Mulcahy did such a fantastic job on the visual storytelling - that Highlander still ranks high in my books as an action film and should be watched by fans and students of the genre.  Forget the overblown effects of movies like Matrix - this has real swordplay, great scenarios, personality and humour.  All this makes the movie inspiring to watch.

Highlander also captures the peak of Christopher Lambert and bad guy Clancy Brown, who defines badness as the immortal villain Kurgen.  Sean Connery cuts a dashing figure as well.  All are perfectly cast.

How and why Russell's epic vision faltered in the sequel to this great film is anyone's guess.  But the original Highlander will remain a classic for years to come.",1118016000,3,1231,4.781990521327014
41248,4,0782008372,"They have lived secretly among us for millenniums; near immortals who can only be killed if their heads are severed from their bodies. They move through time discovering each other - sometimes making alliances, and other times chopping off each other's heads, and waiting for the time of the Gathering, when those few who remain will be inexplicably drawn to New York City for a final struggle over a nebulous prize with only one victor left standing.
When you write out the plot of `Highlander' like that, it is hard to avoid seeing just how silly it all sounds. There is no explanation for what set this game of immortals in motion, or why any one person in any given time is born an immortal. The prize the immortals seek  - described at one point as having knowledge of what everyone is thinking, and being able to advise presidents and scientist while you have children and grow old,  sounds more like the career track of a successful but harried think tank consultant than something that one would struggle and kill for down through the ages. It is best not to think too deeply on these things while watching the movie.
The holes in the plot are well matched by the single-note acting on display. Christopher Lambert, in the title role of Macleod the immortal highlander, broods. Sean Connery playing the foppish but wise Ramirez, Macleod's immortal mentor, hams it up. And Clancy Brown plays the film's villian, the Kurgan - part demon warrior incarnate and part anti-social bad boy, so far over the top that he is a hilarious treat to watch. The rest of the performances are mostly forgettable, excepting Beatie Edney as Heather, the bonnie love of Macleod's youth - she is much too enticing to be forgotten.
The magic of `Highlander' is that despite all of this, it works, and it works well. When the paper thin plot and clichd acting combine with the movie's lively action scenes, flashbacks through time, and driving Queen Soundtrack, it all gels together as a thrillingly unique action adventure fantasy that draws you into its internal logic and makes you forget all of its flaws while you revel in its hammy performances. I have watched it many times over the years and it has manages to capture my imagination each time. Like the origin of the immortals and their quest, there is no good explanation for this - it just is.
Make no mistakes - `Highlander' is a silly B movie, but one that is as exciting and as much fun as any B movie that has ever been made. Watch it and enjoy it as such, and you can't go wrong.

41259,4,0782008372,"In a word, this movie was original. Various aspects of immortality have been explored for years, mostly as vampire legend stories. When this movie premiered we were gifted with beautiful scenery and cinematography. Christopher Lambert's acting is well above typical for action/adventure/fantasy movies.

The story was engaging, directing was also progressive, in that the movie shifts time periods and flashes back to earlier memories for the main character, something that was less common when this film was made than now. Dialogue is generally good, though MacLeod's first wife is a bit of a boor in a small part. Sean Connery delivers quite a fun and memorable performance in a quite lively character. I think he didn't want to return for endless sequels, but it appears that he had fun making the film.

The premise of the movie is simple: there are individuals who are immortal, can sense each other when nearby, and for some reason they must meet and fight to the death (only accomplished via beheading) until there is only one left alive. The movie tagline cashes in on this: ""There can be only one!"" Indeed we are not privy to the reason for this and it is never explained in this film. The swordplay is however, very well choreographed and is not gory. The effects are simple but pretty good for 1986.

Lambert was involved in the creative side and later production as well. Unfortunately the studios weren't very supportive. They had set out to make this movie and the sequel to complete the story at the same time. Budget issues and studio bosses reared their ugly heads and things were cut and the production in trouble in order to complete the second movie, which turned out to be a big disappointment when released. This film, however, didn't get attacked by the budget machine, except for the editing genius who decided the movie was too long and the audience wouldn't sit still, so the studio cut the movie more than Lambert would have preferred. This DVD restores the film to its original desired length and the transfer is very good. Even without liking this genre, you might well enjoy this story.",1110499200,10,2116,4.823691460055096
41260,4,0782008372,"Nearly lost in straight-to-video-hell, Highlander rose like the Phoenix to become one of the most popular cult classic fantasy adventure movies to ever grace the screen.

Released in 1986 on a shoe string budget, the movie is shot in dark and gritty New York City, flashing back to Scotland hundreds of years earlier.  The main character is Conner MacLeod (played with European gusto by then unknown French actor Christopher Lambert) a Scottish Highlander who discovers, very painfully, that he is special; one of a sparse race of immortals that will walk the Earth until one of them wins `The Prize'.  An early battle scene that takes place in the 1600s depicts him fighting with his clansmen and being impaled by another immortal (not known to him at the time), The Kurgan, played with scene stealing villainous venom by Clancy Brown.

After coming back to life, McLeod is ejected from his village as a demon hellspawn and forced to live in solitude with his wife in the highlands.  Despite his shame, he wants nothing more then to have children and a family.

Enter Sean Connery, in a role that most certainly helped bring him back into the lime light, playing Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, or `Spanish Peacock' as McLeod likes to call him.  [A strange observation; they have a Frenchman (Lambert) playing a Scotsman, an American (Brown) playing a German barbarian, and a Scotsman (Connery) playing an Egyptian from Spain...strange role reversals, but I digress]  Connery is fantastic, playing the role for all it is worth.  He reveals to Connor his true nature, that he cannot have children, and that they are meant to walk the Earth until `The Gathering', where the last few remaining Immortals will gather and fight for The Prize.

What happens next is somewhat predictable, but nonetheless, Director Russell Mulcahy handles it well.  The action scenes are great with good swordplay between people of different cultures.  The scenes that take place in modern day New York are fascinating in that you get to see how this man born over 300 years ago lives in today's world.

Hot on his heels is an attractive forensic scientist who discovers that McLeod's sword, an ancient early version of a Japanese Katana, was created long before the Samurai ever started making them.  This peaks her interest and soon she finds out more than she ever thought she would.

Although dark and moody, the movie is lightened with flashbacks to McLeod's happier times, some injection of humor in just the right places and music provided by Queen.  All this amounts to very original movie despite its low budget and near death status going to straight to video.  Highly recommended.",1108944000,7,2670,4.937360178970917
41261,5,0782008372,"Forget the series, and please, please, forget the stupid sequels. This is the only Highlander that matters because anything that came after it was just plain idiotic.

Christopher Lambert is an Immortal. Unless you lop off his head, he will live on forever and ever. This doesn't necessarily go over well in his 16th century Scottish village, but that is the least of his problems. We get the background in a series of flashbacks from the 20th century MacLeod, and to me, the past was always more interesting than the present. Not that the present is not interesting either. In fact, the movie as a whole, is mesmerizing.

There can only be one, and Kurgan, a rather nasty Immortal, is out to find our Highlander and do him like he did MacLeod's mentor (Sean Connery), which is basically lop off his head and drain him of his power. Mind you, MacLeod is out to do the same to Kurgan because there can be only one!

This is a rather simplistic overview of the plot, but to sit here and explain it in detail would be confusing to both the reader and the author of this review. There is simply too much to tell and explain, and what is the fun in that? This is a magical movie, and you just don't give away the good stuff. This is the type of movie that you just sit down, watch, and lose yourself in.

The 20th century love interest is the weakest part in this movie. Brenda (Roxanne Hart), is hardly compelling, a bit on the annoying side, and her look was dated even in 1986.  She can't act to save her life. But it doesn't matter, because this fantasy-adventure has everything that Hollywood lacked at the time, and everyone else did an outstanding job, giving this movie the cult classic status it deserves. Christopher Lambert never did anything that mattered again as far as I am concerned.

The soundtrack, by Queen, is phenomenal, and though a soundtrack does not make a movie, unless it's ""The Wall"" or ""Tommy"", it is worth mentioning because it is truly beautiful.",1102982400,16,1972,4.525280898876405

It was very frustrating to watch.  1 minute it's too low, the next minute it's too high.  You strain to hear dialogue (sometimes you don't hear it at all) and when you do hear it, it gets overpowered by the background noise and the music.

The choice of the brooding Christopher Lambert was perfect for the part of the Highlander, Conner MacLeod. There is a quiet intensity to his acting, and it works well here. Sean Connery, as his mentor and fellow-immortal, Ramirez strikes just the right balance of swashbuckling and seriousness. His acting is perfect. (So what else is new?)
For me, however, Clancy Brown's Kurgan steals the film. His physical features and bug-eyed grin are dead perfect! And his way over-the-top performance, at times, makes you a little afraid of his character, but he makes you laugh, as well. The confrontation between Kurgan and Conner in a church is a great balance of wit and tension.
The battles in Scotland, at the beginning of the film, and the mayhem in the streets of New York City at the end are priceless. My favorite moment: Kurgan steals a car and takes Conner's love interest for a ride. As he careens through the potholes and traffic, he quietly sings ""New York, New York"". Now I know where all our cabdrivers take their lessons from. HIGHLANDER is a great piece of quality mind candy that actually tackles some deep issues.",1089936000,6,1259,4.915492957746479

But, unlike  Flash Gordon, this movie actually has Queen songs right in it! But, as I watched this movie, I began to get really involved in the story. Christopher Lambert(who, in my opinion, is really hot in this movie!) plays Conner Macleod, a Scottish warrior who has been alive for over 300 years. He has come to NYC to battle the last remaining immortals, for there can be only one! The guy who plays Kurgan freaked the sh*t out of me! He was generally scary! I think one of the reasons I loved this movie was because of the underlying love story. I almost cried when Nash lit the candle in the church! Anyway, if you love Queen as much as I do, you'll love to hear their music throughout the movie.

We meet Russel Nash (Christopher Lambert) at a wrestling match where he leaves to the parking garage and gets into a swordfight with a strange man in a business suit. Soon after, we're thrust 500 years ago into the highlands of Scotland, where we learn that Nash is really Connor MacLeod, an immortal being who is banished from his native land and accused of using satanic magic. He then encounters Ramirez (Sean Connery), who teaches him the ways and rules of immortals. From there, the story unfolds into an epic so different from anything else Hollywood has to offer. The overall story itself is a moderate romantic adventure, but the swordfights and camera work as well as original music by legendary band Queen make this film a rollicking good time.

41266,5,0782008372,This is easily the best film of all the Highlander sequals.  An excellent story and well put together with flash backs of Scotland in the fifteenth century.

41267,4,0782008372,"This film is fascinating in many ways. I have the European version with the flashback to the second world war but without the killing of Yung Dol Kim by the Kurgan, which explains the discrepancy in one scene where a paper title announces : HEAD HUNTER 3 POLICE 0. In fact there has only been two killings by the Kurgan at this moment, and will never be three in the film anyway. But it is a marvellous film built on constant flashbacks, very well done all of them, and this navigation through time is thrilling. Then it presents us with a plot that is of interest for our over-famous post-modern world. A new species of humans is born by some mutation. These humans are immortal but they are supposed to fight to the last and to their death for only one of them to survive. This last one is granted special powers over the world. This is a new version, a post-god version of God, as if our imagination and brain could not survive and work properly without a supreme being of some kind. We are here dealing with an essential dimension of human civilization : men need a supreme principle, on a higher level than themselves, to be able to manage the world, manage its knowledge and science, manage its peace and violence. But this archetypical approach goes even farther and reaches a mythical level. We are dealing with a species that pushes its roots deep in the oldest human civilizations : the Celts in Scotland, the  archaic  societies in Siberia or Russia, old Japanese societies, etc. This new species is founded on two elements : they have to fight in duels with broad swords and they can only die if they are decapitated. The first element is typical of the iron age, of the iron society best represented in our history by the Celts, with some roots in the ancient Greek mythology with their Gods of fire and metalwork (smithing), but also with the Greek Zeus and the Celtic Lud, and even the Biblical and Semitic God, who have the power to dominate and use thunder and lightning to punish and frighten men. This touches something in the average public that goes beyond simple action. It moves some old stories, and even superstitions, in our memory, in the memory of humanity. This is one of the deepest layers of our human and universal consciousness or unconsciousness. This then makes a gripping film for which the added suspense and spectacular action can only become mesmerizing. This explains the cult around this Highlander.

41268,5,0782008372,"I'll say it up front - this movie is one of my top five of all time.  I knew none of the stars at the time (save Connery) and maybe this made the story all that better.  Why this particular film had (and has) such an attraction to the general public is not hard to figure out.
The premise, while seen elsewhere, is presented here with only a minimum of hokiness - no deep, theological, mythological or genetic explanations as to why the Eternals came to be - they just are.  The switch between 16th century Scotland and modern America was deft and non-obtrusive.  The acting was spectacular and bad boy Clancey Brown makes a strong, almost show stealing performance.  But it is Lambert in all his quixotic dry wit and somber moods that is the icing on the cake.
Fantastic music - loved the ballade, great action scenes, just a perfect gem.  Then they had to go and try to ruin it with all the follow-ups (garbage), a TV series (It DOESN'T grow on you) the action game (my youngest son said it was ""crummy"") and the Highlander toys.

41279,5,0782008372,"Who wants to live forever?  This is the theme of HIGHLANDER, a film which over time has firmly established a cult following as well as countless sequels and TV series.  Who would've thought that a low-budget film like this (which scored a mere $5,900,000 in the U.S., while becoming a huge hit internationally) would be so popular?
HIGHLANDER is the tale of Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert), a guy who, at first glance, would seem to be your normal 30-year-old New Yorker.  But then, take a closer look: that old look in his eyes, his wealth of knowledge, and - oh yeah, did I mention he RUNS AROUND NEW YORK WITH AN ANCIENT JAPANESE KATANA AND SLICES OFF PEOPLE'S HEADS!!
But all this isn't as odd as it sounds.  You see, MacLeod is one of a race of immortals, born in the highlands of Scotland 500 years ago.  In 1536, he was killed by the evil Kurgan (Clancy Brown) - and then he woke back up.  Woah.  After being brutally beaten and exiled from his hometown, he meets up with Ramirez (Sean Connery), a fellow immortal who teaches MacLeod the ways of their kind.  As it turns out, there can be only one, and that one will be the immortal that survives through the ages to the time of the Gathering in 1986.  The Prize they receive from being the final immortal is a chance to rule the world and have all their dreams come true.
HIGHLANDER is now a part of movie history, and in my opinion one of the most important films of the 1980's.  Lambert is very good (he would later appear in three sequels and one episode of the popular TV series), and Connery is funny - although he's in the film for a total of about 7 minutes.  Rock videomaker Russell Mulcahy's direction is nothing special, but it is done well, especially around the end of the film.
Of course, there's also a majestic, beautiful-sounding score from well-liked composer Michael Kamen, and an awesome rock soundtrack from Queen, which includes the very nice ballad ""Who Wants to Live Forever"".  The film's theme, ""Princes of the Universe"", later served also as the theme for the television show.
The film is extremely entertaining.  From the first moment of the movie, you're completely absorbed - something that could not be achieved in either HIGHLANDER II, III or ENDGAME - all of which are easy to ignore in the series' timeline.
If possible, I would definitely recommend that you watch the director's cut (or ""Immortal Edition"") rather than the theatrical version.  This cut is a very large improvement over the original film.  The DVD also features a remastered soundtrack and a Queen companion CD.
All in all, HIGHLANDER is an extraodinary film matched only by the television series.  It is certainly recommended to any and all.  Ignore the sequels completely, if you can (die-hard fans: rent HIGHLANDER III); for in the end, there can be only one.",1062979200,3,2824,4.649899396378269

I must say that the picture is much improved from the director's cut edition. However do not expect it to be state of the art. You can still see at times the grains but it is much more superior that the director's cut.
In terms of sound, the DVD boasts the DTS-ES system. Now that is state of the art. However, since this is an old film the sound cannot be compared to the Gladiator and Seven discs.
This is the best version of Highlander that is available. I should know I have the director's cut version. A bit pricey though.

Let's start back in the 1500's with the birth of a simple man who only wants to lead a simple life of farming and children.  Some things never work out.  Connor MacLeod is an immortal, one of a rare breed of beings who can only truely die by having his head seperated from his body by a naked blade in battle.  The problem - there are many others like him who wish to do just that in an effort to control the prize and possibly the fate of the world.  Well, in this movie there's just the one who decides to renew the chase in New York City 400 years after their first meeting.
The film follows Connor from his first days of learning what he is in Scotland, to an infamous sword dual in colonial America, and concludes in a fierce fight to the death in NYC.  Along the way we meet the people Connor meets and integrates into his extraordinary life.
Christopher Lambert does a fine job as Connor, and of course Sean Connery his is usual self.  I personally feel Clancy Brown is great as Kurgan, the fearless warrier whose mission is to become the last of the immortals, and whose joy is making Connor sweat.
Sword fights in this film are pretty good.  A little bit of romance that it probably could have done just as well without.  The story has a nice flow to it, bouncing back and forth through time at the appropriate moment to explain certain aspects.
DVD features are fairly typical.  Director's commentary, behind the scenes photos, some (supposedly never before seen footage) and a slew of production stills.
Photographic quality is excellent.  Sound is Dolby Digital Surround.  This one isn't the pick of the litter, but it's a good film nonetheless.",1053820800,5,1815,4.453172205438066
41284,5,0782008372,"One of the most original ideas that came out of he 80's and spawned a true cult following.  Highlander was the movie that made America recognize Christopher Lambert.  The story was well played out and the action was intense.  Hoever it was the idea of the immortals and their eternal struggle for the game that seperated this from the rest.
Highlander starts off at a sporting event.  While there Connor McCloud (Lambert) encounters an immortal.  After they duel Connor is vicotoriouse by severing the head of his opponent.  After wards the police try to track him down for the beheading.  In the mean time an old opponent from the past returns to try and slay him.  In the meantime a female detective gets ever closer to solving the mystery behind the orginal duel.  We are also shown flashbacks of when Connor was younger in the highlands of scotland where he was tutored by Rameriez (played by Sean COnnery) a spainard who was also immortal.  In the end we learn about some of the rules to include that no immortals could duel on Holy Ground.  In the end Connor is victoriouse and it is assumed that he has won the prize, mortality.
Highlander started a lot of things, but overall it is one of the few strong cult followings.  While it may never rival the intesity of Star Trek or Star Wars it is still a succesful series that spawned 3 sequels, 2 live action series, an animated sereis, and a possible broadway musical.

41285,4,0782008372,"Christopher Lambert stars as Connor MacLeod, a 450 year old Highlander who has been transported in time to present-day New York.  Following him is his arch-enemy Kurgan, played superbly by Clancy Brown.  Their battle began centuries ago on a basic premise: There is a small group of immortals that live among humanity, and the only way that they can die is by decapitation.  They seem no different in appearance than regular mortals, but their first death sets them at that age forever. (note Lambert's youthful appearance even though he's 450 years old).  They are always engaged in battle and when one decapitates another, he takes his powers (""the quickening"") and at some future time the survivors will face off against one another (""the gathering"") until there is only one survivor, who will become immensely powerful.
Sean Connery also stars as Ramirez, who has come to help Connor develop his skills as a swordsman so he can successfully face Kurgan.  Unfortunately, it is Ramirez who pays the price.
I enjoyed this movie and the way it was formatted.  I felt that the flashbacks from the present-day to the past were helpful in understanding the plot and how the relationship between MacLeod and Kurgan developed.  The acting, especially by Lambert and Brown, is first rate.  Sean Connery does a fine job as well.  Its too bad that his role was so short.

For those uninitiated to the Highlander plotline, the idea is fairly simple: that amongst humanity live a small group of immortals who can only die by decapitation.  These immortals seem normal humans until their first death, which ""sets"" them forever at that age.  They forever are involved in fighting each other, for when one takes the head of another, he gains their powers in the ""quickening,"" and at some point in the future when very few immortals remain, they will come together for one last battle (the ""Gathering"") in which there can be only one survivor--who will then win the prize, a gift of immense power.
That's where the film takes up the action, though it does also focus on past events in the characters' lives through flashbacks later used to great extent in the spin-off television show.  Connor MacLeod (played by Christopher Lambert) is one of the few remaining immortals when the Gathering is at hand, and he must both battle the evil Kurgan (Clancy Brown) and keep his sword battles from drawing too much interest from modern-day police detectives who unsurprisingly are keen to track down murderers leaving behind headless bodies.
Sean Connery plays the ancient immortal and Connor's mentor Ramirez in many of the flashback sequences to great effect--so much so that film producers tried to reintroduce his character in the second and far less satisfying sequel.
The format of interspersed historical flashbacks and the modern-day chase sequences serves the film well, giving the characters background and laying out the rules by which they interact in the Game.  The soundtrack done by Queen also works quite well in context.  Overall, the movie is fairly unique in its story and does a good job exploring the at-times torured psyches of the immortals.
As for the particulars of the DVD transfer, the video quality is fairly decent--far superior to the VHS, but still a bit dark and murky at points.  The audio mix is fairly good as well, and the second disc features music by Queen (available on their album ""A Kind of Magic"").  Overall, the added features of this edition do not revolutionize the film to separate it from previous versions, but they are worthwhile and provide for a more well-rounded and enjoyable film than earlier editions.",1048204800,4,2493,5.021791767554479

41288,1,0782008372,"I tried, lordie, I tried to watch the whole thing.  I just couldn't.  ""Highlander"" is wallowing somewhere near the top of my list of worst films of all time.  What's wrong with it?  Well, pretty much everything.  Christopher Lambert is such a wooden actor he should have tried out for the lead in Nutcracker.  No facial expression, no tone of voice, nothing.  The costumes, particularly the alleged 16th century Scotland getups, are like something out of a Studio 54 disco party.  The makeup --take a look at the layer of beige on Sean Connery, designed to make him look like an Egyptian or Spaniard or something, it's never clear which.  It misses parts of his face.  The music is ham-handed and intrusive, particularly during the fight scenes.  You can tell it's supposed to be exciting because the music gets real LOUD.  The scenery, awful.  There's the scene where Lambert gets dunked in the Scottish lake and discovers he doesn't drown... you can actually see the sides of the swimming pool festooned with plastic water plants.  There's the combat scene with Connery where the castle is made of plastic bricks that tumble down with every sword stroke.
If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was a Monty Python sendup of the real dungeons-and-dragons genre.  Alas, it's not.  It's supposed to be serious.  Test yourself, see if you can watch it until the end.",1045267200,4,1380,4.779661016949152
41309,3,0782008372,"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, yet another  bigger, more expensive edition of Highlander  is on DVD.  Highlander: That ridiculous over-the-top blending of sword and sorcerer fantasy and science fiction with a modern day action film that featured Christopher Lambert and rub-your-doubting-eyes-all-you-want-it's-really-Connery, Sean Connery.  Connery is only a supporting player in the film, but the fun he seems to be having is not only utterly infectious it also injects the film with the needed charisma and energy it needs to make the goofy thing worth watching.
Highlander makes little logical sense, but tries to pretend it does with various conflicting explanations that never cover plot holes or explain why competitors would be so helpful and friendly with one another if they knew they might have to face each other in a duel to the death....  But never mind logic.. this is action packed pick out the continuity errors-fun isn't it?
UCLA student Gregory Widen (who went on to write and direct Prophecy and was one of the writers of Backdraft) wrote Highlander, as his senior thesis and attempted to create a fantastical legend about a chosen group of immortals who walk the earth for centuries, preparing for duel to the death sword battles with each other.  Mostly set in 1986, it offers the impressive spectacle of swashbuckling sword fights taking place in parking garages, modern streets and rooftops all cut like music videos.  There's a couple of flashbacks to merry old England and the Scottish Highlands that are done quite well (yes, that's the same castle used here that's used in Monty Python and the Holy Grail).
My favorite sequence is still the wild ride Kurgan (Clancy Brown) takes Roxane Hart on toward the end of the film.  Crazed, evil Clancy is immortal and enjoys terrorizing mortals, driving fast, and causing mayhem.  He grabs the film's ingnue and takes her on a wild ride right over poor Mr. Toad  that is a pure visceral shot of cinematic adrenalin.
What keeps Highlander enjoyable and explains it's popular loyal cult following is it's matter of fact, somehow this makes sense, don't try to figure out, we're not completely serious tone. It winds up being a very silly, violent, action packed ride.  It's not outwardly campy and tongue-in-cheek (except when Brown or Connery are on screen). It's directed and edited like a music video which wasn't the case with every other movie back when this was made by  Rusell Mulcahy (who had directed many music videos).  The normally dull and wooden Lambert comes across much better than say a heavily accented Chuck Norris, Van Damme type action hero usually does, simply because the film doesn't linger on him a moment longer than it has to.  Just when the film starts sagging big time, Sean Connery arrives on the scene playing the kind of  high energy Errol Flynn you've always wanted him to play.  Things get down-right cartoonish with the proper introduction of an over-the-top bad attitude, bad guy Kurgan (Brown).  Suddenly the film feels like a WWF extravaganza with swords instead of folding chairs.  And so it goes.
Yes, Highlander is a guilty pleasure film.  It's fun, if you let it be.  It's got exciting visuals.  The sequels are awful, the t.v. series better than you'd think, but the first movie
is well... the One.
Highlander also features three mediocre Queen Songs that are so incongruent and wrong for the film... they fit perfectly.
IMAGE AND SOUND
Highlander was originally thrown onto the marketplace in a Republic DVD release that was one of the worst DVDs ever released. A restored director's cut version was later produced which added about ten minutes of footage to the film, and then came an improved re-mastered version.  Previous (to 2002) Anchor Bay releases have been discontinued. This new edition features an Anamorphic widescreen presentation which is superior to former editions.  The film was not made  on a huge budget and has a slightly softer focus than the crisp images  newer films have, but there were all these filters and smoke and various lighting  effects going on  and then effects were added via computer 1980's style.  You won't find much artifacting and the black levels are stronger, but details in the shadows are still lost and some of the darker scenes look pretty muddy.
The audio is where Anchor Bay has gone crazy making a new DD EX mix AND  a six-channel DTS mix.  Lots of  use of the various channels during action sequences.  For all the noise and flash the dialogue remains clear and easy to hear.  When the film isn't being bombastic and over the top, it's way too quiet and the sudden jumps might be annoying and sound very shrill to the uninitiated.  More sensitive viewers will want to have the remote nearby to monitor the volume control.  To those knowing it's a cheesy, campy film, this loud re-mix is perfect for the film.
Extra Features:
Well  the extras for the ...IMMORTAL package consist of the metal slipcase, a 24 page booklet of production notes and an additional disc that has three Queen songs (Princes of the Universe, One Year of Love and Friends will be Friends).  Oh you also get three Queen videos and a couple of  mediocre still galleries  as well.
If you're a Highlander film fanatic AND a big fan of Queen, it might be worth getting this special collectors package.  Otherwise the other Highlander DVD will satisfy you just fine.
Incidentally the interesting Queen version of New York, New York  (form the film) remains the only known unreleased Queen song. It is not on the bonus C.D. of this package.<P",1038614400,41,5564,4.895410885805763

41312,5,0782008372,"Beautiful direction, a unique storyline, and an outstanding cast have always made this movie a favorite of mine. Russell Mulcahy did a fabulous job with this film, bringing viewers gorgeous scenes from Scotland, and even dredging up beauty in New York City. We follow the immortal life of Connor MacLeod, from his ""first"" life in 16th century Scotland, through the discovery of his gifts (with help from Sean Connery,) and into modern life. There are scenes in this cut which weren't in the original release, including a scene from World War II, where we discover something important about a person close to Connor. Mulcahy flashes backward and forward in time, but it's not disorienting or annoying in the slightest - he weaves the lines of the story together with amazing skill.
The Queen soundtrack is outstanding, and Freddie Mercury's angelic voice singing ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" contributes a great deal to what I consider one of the most poignant moments in film, ever.
Clancy Brown is, naturally, a truly sinister presence throughout the movie, pulling his role off without venturing too far over the ""overacting his part"" line, which is difficult to do with such an over-the-top character. Christopher Lambert is a soft-spoken, refined tough guy, and carries himself well throughout the story.
It's tragic that the second movie was such an abysmal piece of junk, but this one...this one is priceless; not to be cute, but maybe there should have been only one. The attention to detail is remarkable (they even got the MacLeod tartan right - or so it looks without reeeeeally close inspection.) Have I mentioned that this film is *beautiful*? Just checking.
The DVD is not overwhelming; very few extras, including Queen videos and not much else, alas. The director's cut is an interesting change from the original, but there isn't a huge amount of difference - a few things dropped, a few things added, only one of which was of remarkable interest.
If you haven't seen this movie, you simply must - if you have seen it, and you enjoyed it, having it around the house to throw in whenever you feel like revisiting the great story is very handy. Most recommended!",1035072000,7,2173,4.907608695652174
41313,5,0782008372,"I am reviewing the Director's Cut of this DVD. The film his added scenes, and greatly enhanced surround sound (very muy bueno). Don't bother with the Immortal Editon. It has nothing to offer.
So here we go. The 16th century collides with modern day. Good vs Evil, with immortals. Could it get any better!!! The cinetography is superb in its darkness, the soundtrack is great (Queen), and the editing is tight. There is enough swordplay between the Immortals to keep a samurai glued to the screen.
When this film came out, it was the cutting edge of sci-fi/ incorporated rock sound track. Christopher Lambert burst into this film as a soft-eyed hero, and there is immediate empathy to the character. He plays a Scot from the 16th century who discovers he is immortal. Unfortunately, the rest of the immortals are trying to kill each other for `The Prize', which is undisclosed until the final moments of the film. Throughout the movie, you `feel' his sadness at being immortal, and outliving those he loved. Unfortunately Lambert accepted roles in too many B films later on. But I still like the guy.
The film does a great job of connecting modern day events to the past with flashbacks, ending a New York scene with a rise in the camera angle into ancient Scotland as if you are on an elevator emerging from the earth. Very nice touch, an effect I have yet to see since. The Scottish clan battles set in the 16th century are pre-Braveheart, yet realistic.  In the DVD I have, there are replaced scenes of `McCloud episodes' through history.
Along with fairly decent (for the time) special effects, you have a most excellent villian in The Kurgan (Clancy Brown...and where did HE go). He plays the role with virve, and a bit of humor (modern day, he kills another immortal, stabs a vigillante, and steals a car. In the car is an old woman. He calmly turns to her and says ""MOM?""...singing `New York New York after he kidnaps the heroine...)) His role is so impressive, in a way, you he steals the movie.
A nice treat is Sean Connery as another immortal who trains Connor McCloud in the art od swordsmanship (which, by the way, was actually played by the actors, and very well choreographed). Bad part is he plays a 16th century Spaniard, who is actually Egyptian, and has a British accent. Still, he adds a very real touch of class even though he is only in the film for fifteen minutes.
There isn't a better example of Good vs Evil in a sci-film (okay, maybe The Matrix). Like my other reviews, I refuse to ruin the movie or the ending with an easy give-away. (okay, the final scenes are SUPERB swordplay and the hero wins...sorry. had to do it).
As to the soundtrack. You can't beat Queen for feeling and being in touch with the scene. There isn't a soul who has seen this film who cannot feel the pain and agony of loss (set 16th century Scotland) as Connor McCloud's wife, Blossom, grows old and dies to Queen's `Who Wants To live Forever'.
You who have seen this film will want the Director's Cut. You who haven't, well, trust me, you'll want it too.",1032912000,,3054,4.562841530054645
41314,1,0782008372,"First, I am really fond of this movie. But, each iteration of DVD has been hugely disappointing. The wit and imagination that crafted the movie in the first place is nowhere in the minds of the people doing the DVDs.
For instance, the opening scene (in Madison Sqr Garden) originally piqued your curiosity by showing a fight scene that is surprising (to say the least) for the time and setting... but in this new Immortal Edition, they've spliced in scenes from 16th Century Scotland BEFORE the parking garage fight even begins.  What could they have been thinking?
Worst of all is the technical quality of the DVD: the video transfer is mediocre at its best; the sound is worse, with volume and clarity fluctuating all over the place; and the subtitles - are simply MISSING for most of the dialog.
Like the other digital versions of this movie, the Immortal is a half-hearted and half-witted effort! If you like this film, as I do, buy the VHS version, and keep hoping the owners/producers eventually join the digital age.",1031702400,,1023,4.747191011235955

but it turned out to be one of my favorite movies as well as the sequels 3 and 4....(i don't think there was ever a 2.....i refuse to acknowledge the existance)unfortunetly the television series far surpasses the original movie (as i own every episode of the six season show i can vouch for that )so that when i watch the original movie it does not have the same zing that it had the first 50 times(just kidding i've only seen this movie about 5 times)but the movie is light enough for repeated viewing as well as always entertaining..it will fit nice in any dvd collection.",1031616000,,950,4.403409090909091
41316,1,0782008372,"I love the premise of this film. I truly do. Random immortals are caught up in a game where they must kill each other by chopping each other's heads off, the last survivor proclaimed the winner. Later chapters with better attention paid to quality are excellent films and well worth a watch, but sadly, what should have been a great sci-fi film is an utter disaster in its execution.
First off, the casting. Great actors, but you really start to wonder what to do with their accents. You have a Frenchman playing a Scotsman, while the Scotsman plays a Spaniard, and it gets more muddled from there. Fortunately, the accents are completely mangled to the point where you can't distinguish them for most of the film, but I'll get to that later on.
Second, the soundtrack. You remember Flash Gordon, right? All Queen, all the time. Well, as if that wasn't bad enough, it's repeated for this film. Now I can handle a couple of Queen songs in a row, but I'm just not enough of a rabid fan to put up with it for an hour and a half without whimpering at yet another Queen song boring into my brain. Using one group for a rock-with-vocals soundtrack is something that should never be done unless you are making a film about that group, which will assure that only rabid fans are forced to sit through it.
Third, the direction. What is going on here? Cut scenes from past and present are sort of tossed together as if they were held in place only by duct tape, jarring the senses of the viewer. It's enough to give you a migraine.
Finally, the technical difficulties. The soundtrack is loud, the dialogue is hushed to the point of muffled whispers. Lambert has a soft voice to begin with, but with the sound so muted I missed half of what he said and had to rewind and try to read his lips. At least here is where the failure of the sound technician compensated for the misplaced accents. For half the movie you couldn't even hear the accents. The lighting technician apparently didn't show up for work, either, as half the battle scenes are so dark you can't really get an idea of what's going on, guided into belief that there's swordplay only by the sounds of crashing blades. Combine this with the director's poor choice of angles and even what is visible is of very little help in seeing any action.
It's sad that what on its face should have earned at least four stars was degraded by sloppy production to a waste of celluloid. Read a synopsis of Highlander and then watch the much better done sequels.",1030752000,3,2499,4.482456140350878

41318,3,0782008372,"Hi, these are some additional comments with respect
to my last post regarding the dvd version of
'Highlander':
I did a little more research.  It turns out that when
this movie was released, there were two versions, an
American version, and a European version.  The American
version did not have the additional six minutes of
footage where the relationship between McLeod and Rachel
was explained.
Anyway, I watched it again, and still think the American
version was superior.  In the American version, the
relationship between them is not explained, but it is
obvious that it is a platonic one.  So you're left with
the impression that McLeod doesn't allow himself to fall
in love with anyone since the death of his Heather,..
until Brenda enters his life.
The American version, in my opinion, is better because
in the European version, if he is willing to adopt Rachel
as his daughter it kind of leaves a logic gap as to why he
wouldn't want another romantic relationship with someone
over the course of 500 years.  Single parenthood, when one
is immortal, doesn't quite add up.
In the American version, you get the impression that
Rachel is in love with McLeod, but he simply doesn't
feel the same way towards her.  You're never told
how come she knows he's immortal, but the fact that
she does, and that they still have this platonic thing
between them, makes it really cool, and makes the
growing love between him and Brenda even more
meaningful.
Yeah, I know, I'm splitting hairs, but I think the
American version was the more romantic one...Then again,
because this movie made such an impact on me when I
first saw it, maybe I'm just not comfortable with
another different version of it, even if it is the
'director's cut'.  Given DVD technology, you would think
it would be possible to toggle between the US and
European version.
I really wish it was possible to order the American
version of this film on dvd, even though when it first
came out, it didn't do very well in theatres, stateside..
Which is probably the reason the American version isn't
available on dvd.",1023840000,2,2075,4.731301939058172
41329,2,0782008372,"I really like this movie.  I think it is a very beautifully shot, non-pretentious, interesting, and entertaining movie.  So why do the powers that be insist on splicing in a scene that looks and is acted so badly it stands out like a sore thumb?  It even has a jarring awful transition into the scene in a movie otherwise full of beautiful transitions.
If you don't know the story of this scene, here it is in brief.  The Director and Producers decided not to shoot the scene where Conner meets Rachael, to save some money.  During editing they changed their minds, and paid, out-of-pocket to set up and shoot that scene.  They called back Christopher Lambert and got some child actor and quickly slapped the scene together.  With the scene shot they went back to editing and spliced the footage in and decided it looked really bad and took it out again.
Fast forward to the release of the Directors-Cut and the only way to justify a Directors-Cut--by inserting this terrible footage.  Now I can't get a DVD version without this awful scene.
If this scene had been done properly (as in budgeted for, and done when Lamberts regular make-up person was there (I keep asking myself if this is what a person looks like on film with no make-up, or just with really really bad make-up), and if Lambert had felt like acting that day ) this could have been a very beneficial scene for the movie--but as it stands it's not.

Unlike the first DVD (where the MPEG artifacts had MPEG artifacts), this is a nice, clean anamorphic transfer that looks quite good on my 120"" screen.
The main menu is peculiar and has a somewhat irritating a/v segue between the top-level menus and the sub-menus, but it's usable.
My principal gripe with this disc is the ""director's cut"" edit.  In some ways, this edit improves the original US release by providing additional back story for some of the characters.  However, this cut also adds some other footage which, in my opinion, detracts heavily from the mysterious nature of the beginning of the movie.  They've also ""touched up"" some of the effects work in a couple of the battle scenes in a way that didn't add much.
The 5.1 remix (DD and DTS) also adds some gratuitous sound effects which I find distracting and actually (in the climactic sequence) detrimental to the movie.
So, in sum, this disc is a mixed bag.  I have ordered it after viewing a rental copy because the quality if the transfer is the best so far.

This film spawned three sequels and a very successful television series, and a  second television series ""Highlander: The Raven"" has come and gone. I think there was a short lived cartoon series as well. Like most very successful movie and or television series there is a series of books to continue where the movies and television series left off, you can blame Star Trek for that trend I think. So where is the comic book and the video game?
Now The Plot. In 1530's Scotland Connor MacLeod played by Christopher Lambert, learns his true identity and nature of being an immortal, by dying. The only way an immortal  can truly die is to be decapitated. Connor is trained by fellow immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez played by Sean Connery, for the time of ""The Gathering"". The Gathering is a time when only a few immortals are left and they will be drawn to each other by a strong feeling and compelled to fight each other to the death. The last remaining immortal will win the prize, which although not thoroughly explained, is the main goal for all immortals. The bad guy is called The Kurgan (Clancy Brown), the strongest and most powerful of all immortals. The Kurgan knows that Connor is immortal and during a battle between clans kills him but is swept away by other fighters before he can cut off Connor's head. Flash-forward to the 1980's Connor, going by the alias of Russell Nash falls in love with Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) a police pathologist that reminds him of his 1500's Scottish wife Heather. Conner soon learns that The Kurgan, now Mr. Victor Kruger is around and on the hunt. You get the idea for the rest of the film.
This DVD is released by Republic Pictures, and has it's good qualities and it's bad. The Picture and Sound Quality is very good. The Sound is digitally THX re-mastered and is therefore excellent. The soundtrack is performed by Queen, an interesting side note is that they were originally slated to do just the main title theme but loved the film so much they were inspired to provide more songs for the soundtrack. The Picture quality  is mostly great but dark in some places and somewhat grainy during some of the flashbacks to 16th century Scotland.
The Extras are a mixed bag. This DVD is Widescreen, but I don't think animorphic. There is the original Theatrical trailer, which like most DVD trailers is of lesser sound & picture quality of the actual movie. The 10th Anniversary Director's cut has unseen, in the theatre, footage, mostly the Scottish Highland flashbacks which add to the understanding of the film, but for some reason were left out for the original North American theatrical release. There is an audio commentary by Director Russell Mulcahy, with Producers Peter Davis and William Panzer. Language Choices for playback and subtitles is English & Spanish. Another feature, which is both a blessing and a curse is the ""Slide Show"" of publicity stills, background production information, cast bios and all sorts of stuff. When this is ""Played"" it flies by with Blinding turbo MTV speed, with no audio background. Fortunately my Sony player has two slowmo speeds, so with the slower speed, and by pausing, I was able to view the bio information, the publicity stills, production notes etc... Another curse is the chapter selection has ONLY 9 ""Key"" Scenes, fortunately by using the scene list in the booklet you can enter individual scenes remotely.

When I first saw the brown bordered cover, with the word  ""Widescreen"" all in bold caps on the left hand side, slightly larger than the Title, I knew something was done very cheesy.
Since I'm an occasionally watching fan of the television series, I like the movie that made the series possible. It took me two or three episodes of the series to understand some of the ways of the immortals. In some ways I like the series better than the movie. But I'm disappointed with some of the ""Extras"" on the DVD. Unfortunately some of the practices I'm disappointed with, are apparently standard Republic Pictures DVD practices. The Second DVD in the Highlander series ""Highlander 2 - Renegade Version"" also has a lame 9 ""Key"" scenes chapter search and the ultra fast ""Slide Show"" and don't forget the Bold ""Widescreen"" emblazoned on the front cover of the case.
So although my ratings will be on the high side I'm disappointed with the packaging and especially the lameness of the extra's. So for Highlander The 10th Anniversary Director's Cut I give a 4 for picture and a 5 for sound.",1021939200,,4528,4.763057324840764
41337,3,0782008372,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  The digital transfer here is light-years better than that of the previous DVD incarnation.  The sound quality is also significantly better, although it fails to live up to the expectations of a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.  Unfortunately, the annoying (previously deleted) scenes incorporated in the ""Director's Cut"" DVD are present here as well.  The DVD would have been enhanced by making these scenes available as bonus material - or better yet, offering viewers the choice of watching the main feature with or without them.
It is the bonus material that disappoints the most.  The same extras present in the dismal ""Director's Cut"" DVD release are here, with the notable exception of the bug which turned the behind-the-scenes photos into the slide show from hell.  Also included are several Queen music videos from the movie's soundtrack, as well as photos of the band.
However, the latter appear to be stills taken from the music videos, or cover art of singles released throughout the world in support of Queen's ""A Kind of Magic"" album. Anyone familiar with the CD reissue of this album has seen them in the booklet - and would know where to find the three songs featured in the bonus second disc.  There is nothing new here.
The Queen material strikes me as a misguided tribute to the late Freddy Mercury.  Even the feature DVD disc has his image next to Christopher Lambert's!  And while the soundtrack is arguably an important part of the movie, it is hardly the reason why HIGHLANDER has become a cult favorite.  Thus, all the Queen material, while relevant, accomplishes very little in this DVD release.  Neither Freddy Mercury nor his bandmates wrote, directed, or acted in the film.  I would have rather seen a making-of featurette, or hear Sean Connery in character.
If you love HIGHLANDER, get the single DVD, which would rate 3 1/2 to 4 stars.  The ""Immortal Edition"" is a misnomer, and offers little bang for your buck, since you could get BOTH the regular DVD and Queen's ""A Kind of Magic"" CD for less.  One has to wonder whether the HIGHLANDER DVD is becoming an immortal itself, with new versions being released all the time, yet none meeting the obvious expectations of fans.  There should only be ONE, but why, when the releases can go on forever?",1021939200,3,2311,4.815189873417721

41339,3,0782008372,"While ""The Highlander"" has always been one of my favorite movies,  I was greatly disappointed by the Tenth Anniversary DVD.  The sound and picture were lacking,  making my VHS cassette a cleaner option.
Fast forward a few years,  and along comes the ""immortal edition.""  Promises abound about more material,  better picture and sound quality,  and Bonus Queen music.
Did the new edition deliver?
While the plot and story are the same as always,  quality of the presentation has been rather varied.  The Tenth Anniversery edition was almost painful,  so it was hard to imagine this version not being a step up.  And a step up it was.
However,  it could still be better.  The picture's not as grainy,  and the lips are actually in synch this time,  but there is grain to the picture that's not even present in VHS.  The sound is also a step up,  but it could definitely better.
Part of the lure for me was the Queen material.  The four videos seemed slapped in there (You can even hear the final notes of ""The Show Must Go On,""  an unrelated peice of music,  at the beginning of ""A Kind of Magic"")  And the picture is not up to snuff with the other collections that contain these videos.  Of the three music tracks,  two are available on a Queen CD,  where the mixes of several songs used for ""The Highlander,""  which woulda been more appropriate,  are still unavailable.
I recommend the movie itself,  but could not in good conscience promote this edition and reward such a half assed job.  The movie itself recieves 5 stars,  the quality/presentation of it barely even merits 1 star.",1020902400,,1583,4.613718411552346

The new DTS/ES sounds good, but suffers from some source limitations that are almost painful to the ears.  And the new Anamorphic picture is cleaned up a lot from the old DVD released back in 97, but still suffers from some horrible grain and edge enhancement that mars the picture.

I don't really understand why critics were so hard on it, much less do I understand why a few people here are insulting the movie itself (I know the DVD transfer was bad, so I relate to those people) or why the movie was so cheap, then again, the quality of the transfer of this movie would explain it. But this movie is excellent in all aspects. It's unique, and it unfortunately has had its glory destroyed by lousy sequels and TERRIBLE TV shows.
In terms of the acting, contrary to what other people claim here, Christopher Lambert's performance is first rate, and I think it a shame that he has subsequently appeared mostly in bad 1 1/2 star flicks and hasn't since had a real breakthrough in movies. Sean Connery adds real style to the movie with his acting, but it's a shame that he's in there for such a short time. Clancy Brown is as sinister as ever as Kurgan.
The visuals and effects are great by any standard and the swordfighting scenes are excellent
And WHO could possibly diss the rocking musical score by Queen? With such a strong opening theme (""Princes of the Universe"") a truly emotional ballad (""Who Wants to Live Forever"") and their smash hit single (""A Kind of Magic"") just to name a few, you can't go wrong. If you learned about this movie just by being a Queen fan, and first watched the movie out of interest in their score (my situation), you're in for a real treat.
To fans of this movie who were disappointed by the latest transfer, My only suggestion is to wait a while for the Highlander Immortal Edition which will be released April 16, 2002. It promises better sound and picture quality, the uncensored Director's Cut, Commentary, and plenty of Queen material including music videos to their songs from this movie which are musical and visual masterpieces (I've seen them). Plus it's in anamorphic widescreen format, and anamorphic seems like a good way to go especially for a movie like this.

41359,5,0782008372,"Highlander is a grade B movie that qualifies as a guilty pleasure.
This is a story of ""immortals"" that chase each other through the centuries.  In this universe, there will eventually only be one immortal left. The contest requires that they battle with swords ending with the winner decapitating the loser thus gaining his powers.
The story starts out in the 1500's with warring Scottish clans.  McLeod, Christopher Lambert, flashes back between our time and different periods of history with plenty of sword fights and special effects.  The movie has a video game feel to it; it's not a serious study of what it would be like to be immortal.  Still it triggers all sorts of fantasies about what it would be like to face danger on a regular basis, perhaps be fatally stabbed and yet never die.  It would also be fascinating to be an eyewitness to history for all times.
Another reviewer cited the poor quality of the audio portion, which admittedly was a little rough, however, with all the thick accents; the English subtitles were helpful anyway.

41362,4,0782008372,"It was a bad day for Connor Mcleod. Born in 1518 in Scotland, he went out to war and found he couldn't die. Not so bad in itself, 1518 was not a good time to be conspicuously different, and nothing raises more suspicions in times of brutal war than immortality. Bloody but alive, Mcleod is exiled and meets a man named Ramirez, sword-master to King Phillip, Shogun Matsemune, various Pharoh's, and - like Mcleod, an alleged immortal. It's Ramirez who clues Mcleod into his fate - to battle against other immortals spread around the world until he is the only one left. (They can be killed by having their heads chopped off - they are otherwise immune to old age, disease and lesser injuries). The ultimate victor will be awarded ""The Prize"" - nobody knows what the prize is but, given the pyrotechnics that mark the end of every fight, we just know it's got to rock. The other immortals have become fearsome warriors otherwise hidden from the each other but somehow drawn together by the mysterious ""Quickening"" - the magic that gives them their strength, their immortality and (unless they're fast with that broadsword) their doom. Among these other warriors is the Kurgan - a fearsome knight from the Russian Steppe where they toss the weak and the sick to pits of vicious dogs for fun. By modern days (actually, 1987), Mcleod and the Kurgan remain the last surviving ""Immortals"" - each one modern-savvy but also remaining their medieval selves deep down. While the rest of the world listens to CD's, and drives fast cars, the surviving immortals duke it out with broadswords on tops of buildings or in vacant lots in hearts of desiccated cities, each one not only fighting for his life, but for the priceless prize.
This was the first ""Highlander"" - before the sequels and the show - and the textbook case for a great movie that should have never become a franchise. (The studio should have taken the phrase ""there can be only one!"" more seriously). Sequels and the show spoiled the whole idea by trying to explain who the immortals are (actually aliens from a planet called Zeist, according to ""Highlander 2: the Quickening"", exiled to earth only 500 years ago as punishment for their failed attempt to oust the planet's cruel leader) or turn them into heroes (against a wicked sorcerer played by Mario Van Peebles in ""Highlander 3""). There is no overt good or bad to the immortals other than a magnified and more long-lived version of what everybody has. When Mcleod reunites with the Kurgan in an NYC Church (being holy ground, it's a neutral zone), the gathering starts less as one of mortal enemies than of old acquaintances - a couple of 500 year-old men shooting the breeze and comparing notes. The direction deftly understates the immortals' pain of watching loved ones grow old and die. With a great score built around the album ""It's a Kind of Magic"", ""Highlander"" almost becomes a perfect rock-fantasy-epic. With it's very 1987 attitude (""It's better to burn out than fade away"") this movie is fixed in its time and yet as timeless as the immortals themselves.",1009411200,,3074,4.758426966292135

They are done so in sword fight duels well done by both Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery. The evil immortal of the movie is The Kurgan (Clancy Brown), a Russian immortal seeking the prize through killing Connor MacLeod as well as becoming the last immortal. While the movie shows Connor and the kurgan dueling with immortals, we go through flashbacks to 1536 and 1542. 1536 was the date were Connor was viciously wounded by the Kurgan in the battle the MacLeods and the Kurgans. Miricously he was revived and believed to be a devil worshipper therefore driven away from his home, Glennfinnan, Scotland. He came to Glencoe to settle down and marry farm girl Heather.

But it didn't detract from the mood of the film. I have the original VHS, the director's cut VHS, and the widescreen director's cut DVD. In that I acquired each as they became available, I've never regreted their purchase. On picture and sound quality, yes the DVD could have been better. But, again, it's not enough to detract from the mood of the film. And let's make no mistake about it, this picture is about mood and feelings. As far as the Queen music goes -- well, let's just say I've never been a fan. But even so, ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" was quite appropriate for the sequence where it was played. And the Michael Kamen score (the orchestral pieces) is rousing and wonderful. I still don't care for the sequels or the series. But then, they are but shadows of what was attempted in the original movie.

41380,2,0782008372,"The director should put together a special edition style repolishing of this movie and gutting out Queen's spacey, cartoonish, synth laden, cheapy '80s soundtrack and instead put in a wide variety modern artists like Marilyn Manson, Destiny's Child, Little Bow Wow, Nine Inch Nails, Rob Zombie, Beck, Metallica, Cannibal Corpse, System of a Down, Paula Cole to name just a few. This is a teenage movie, so I suppose it made sense that they chose Queen instead of Brian Wilson or someone more adult oriented and ill-suited for a fantasy-swords and sorcery/sci-fi youth oriented film, but their annoying Dungeons and Dragons era music may have fit perfectly with the '80s teenage crowd but it needs an new facial guided by modern artists. Back in the day I guess, gifted, multidimensional, do-it-all bands like Queen were so diverse and talented (and unusually literate during their really old '70s cheez-o-rama glam rock period)that they could actually be counted on to score the entire film, like Prince who made all the music for his own films, and handle many types of styles and emotional states, but that's the best you can say about this. When I hear the final song in the movie ""A Kind of Magic"" I'm reminded of all these annoying '80s movies like Breakfast Club and Never Ending Story. Maybe Queen, because of their background, was perfectly suited to scoring a fantasy-mythology type story telling flick for young adults back then, but I think people like Marilyn Manson and Eminem are better suited to handle deep subject matter and rich, healthy, strong, youthful, passion and act as a guide for today's youth. Plus, I'd like to see some additions of alot of digitized creatures, giant lizards, furry teddy bares, squeeking mammals, cuddley aliens, cuter sound effects and various technical advancements and colorings and improvements that would give it an extra BANG and make kids want to see it again. Maybe some day they could switch the actors digitally and replace Christopher Lambert with Freddie Prinz Jr. and the female lead with Cameron Diaz's cheeky supermodel face.

You see I'm kind of an anal person and I need to know all the back ground on things.  (Kind of like watching ""Planet of the Apes IV, V and VI).  Anyway, in the Non-Directors cut you don't know why he is so attached to his secretary.  In the Directors cut you find out that He rescued her from the Nazis in WWII and raised her like a daughter.  Anyway, I am getting the Directors cut exclusively for this scene.

I started to watch the movie and was disapointed with the first ""duel"" in the parking lot. I don't remember the dozens of ""backflips"" that Connors opponent makes, over and over again.

The picture quality is even better than the VHS, whose print I found to be dark and muddy. I would prefer to give the movie 5 stars, but there are some serious problems with the DVD format in this instance.
WHAT ABOUT THE SOUND, THOUGH? Most of the dialogue was next to impossible to hear, unless the characters were shouting. Fiddling with the volume constantly is not only distracting but downright aggravating. The special features are also in need of serious adjustment. I wanted to see stills from the production, and they went by so fast they were impossible to view. And the scene selector, wherein you are SUPPOSED to be able to skip to your favorite scene is difficult to navigate.

That is basically the whole premise of the original Highlander and it's sequels, and amazingly, the story seems to stay fresh throughout this first installment of the classic series.  Sean Connery is fantastic as Ramirez and in my view Highlander would not be as good as it is without his presence.  Clancy Brown is also good as the villian Kurgan who stalks Connor throughout the years in the movie, leading up to the final battle between the two culminating in the claiming of the prize the Immortals fight for.  This is the best Highlander movie, but my only gripe is that the DVD picture quality is nowhere to be seen and if you watch this next to the video version of Highlander you'll see no difference.

I found it very watchable and only noticed some fuzziness now and then. The soundtrack isn't done that well (the dialogue is too low and the music by queen is too high), but this really isn't that big a deal. Unless you're a hardcore Highlander fan i doubt you'll notice or care about any of these faults. This was probably the cheapest DVD i've ever gotten (it was like 7 bucks), and for that price it was well worth it. Sure, it's not made as well as it could have been, but it's also not as expensive as it could have been either.

He is a guardian of the human race keeping evil from taking hold.  The only thing I would do different is keep the sex scenes out of it.

The movie looks grainy and has little white specks flickering throughout the movie. Plus the sound quality is lousy. I have never seen such poor quality in a DVD!

41406,5,0782008372,"As far as I can tell, the only difference between this and the 10th Anniversary Edition is that this one has a different cover. As for the film itself, I find it very enjoyable, especially when it is the Director's Cut version, as it has great additional footage. Now, I know the ending of the film is a bit weird, and the training with Ramirez (Sean Connery) is really weird, but I still gave the film 5 stars because it has a huge fun factor. This movie contains some top notch acting (sure, it's no ""Sense & Sensibility"", but at least you won't fall asleep watching it), great fight scenes, great characters, and memorable locations. Many critics complain about the camera angles and cut scenes, but those add to the experience. Frankly, I wonder if these people prefer the static camera angles of soap operas.
Anyway, this is the best and only Highlander film worth watching, and it rates better than the TV show. This movie also, in a sense, offers a counter balance to the romantic mythism surrounding vampire-goth films....living forever is not all wine socials and classical piano by the fire. It's really, really lonely.
As for the content-story-plot, basically our hero Connor MacLeod is an immortal, who has been living on earth since the 1500's. The time of the Gathering has arrived, where immortal must fight immortal until one remains, becoming god-like in power (a.k.a. gaining the prize). Immortals can only die by having their heads cut off, which means there are sword fights and decapitations for the whole family. It really is a fun movie, and the price is right.
Just one last note: it's best to not compare this film to the three ""sequels"" or the series, as they only vaguely tie together.",983664000,8,1712,4.748322147651007

Clancy Brown has delivered much better performances than he does here, and it's hard to take him seriously as the main villain.  The character development in the flashback sequences is OK, but it makes no sense why anyone does what they do in the modern era, and some of the dialogue is just ear-gratingly bad.  Worst of all, though, the gathering itself just doesn't have the sense of drama you'd expect it to.  There doesn't seem to be much of a sense of urgency to any of the characters, and that makes the film itself seem kind of slow.
I was also disappointed by the film quality, as I think other reviewers have observed . . . haven't really looked at the other DVD extras, but I don't see them overcoming the general disappointment I had in the movie itself.",983491200,,842,4.4480519480519485

You will not find a worse image quality on DVD even if you tried! First, it is appalling to sell a letterbox transfer as ""state of the art"", as it says on the box. Only an anamorphic transfer derserves to be called that.... The picture is so bad, I truely have seen better looking VHS-tapes. The people at ""Widescreen Review"" must have been drunk or bribed to rate it 4.5 - there simply is no other reasonable explanation. The noise in some scenes is so bad, it looks like snowflakes - this cannot be attributed solely to the high-speed film used for some parts of the movie. Diagonal lines are completely torn up by the lack of resolution. There are artifacts of all kinds throughout the movie. It is a shame! The sound quality is very disappointing, too - this is what you get when you try to squeeze a stereo master into the 5.1 format - very unnatural sounds with artificial, reverberated ambience and dialogues. Some very disturbing noise (hiss) is clearly audible, too. I have to use all my discipline not to resort to very personal, R-rated comments about the studio and producers who are responsible for this terrible DVD.

This 10th Anniversay edition rules, the added scenes are great, they really round out the movie, and have it making a lot more sense, as far as characters go.

My negatives are as follows:
Cheesy menu, but that's not my priority in choosing a DVD anyway.  Blade Runner has the same problem, and is still a wonderful  movie.
Slightly grainy when shown on my 19"" monitor...not a problem on a regular TV.  Looked like the grain was from the film, not an artifact.
Surround sound track pretty iffy...also not a problem on a simple traditional TV.  Not sure why this was so pronounced on one  system and not the other.
The ""still shots"" were done as they used to be on LASERDisc, which means as individual sequential frames.  My DVD player is  not set up to step both forwards and backwards...only forwards,  so this was slightly annoying.
Anyway, overall this is a decent DVD.  It's not my best quality disk...that honor would be saved for ""The Matrix.""  But for such a cheap disk, with such a great movie, it's a good buy.

Maybe it's because I have a TV that's not that great in the first place, but I don't really see any major video or audio problems with this DVD.  I guess if you have a home theater system the low quality is obvious, but if you just have a ""regular"" TV with the DVD player plugged right into it, I doubt you will notice any problems.

The good memories blossomed in my mind so I decided to buy the DVD because I thought it was such a classic.  Actually, with the  eyes of the 32-old that I am now, it's really bad. Except for Sean Connery  the acting is bad, for starters. The fighting scene music is atonal mayhem  (considering I appreciate heavy metal, that is saying something). Specific  to this DVD: The Director's Cut thing adds little, if anything. The sound  and music is very loud in comparison to the dialogues. Sometimes there is  subtitling when they're actually not saying anything audible.",966297600,3,661,4.504201680672269
41463,4,0782008372,A great classic tale. For the price you can't pass it up. I am surprised at the lack of quality in this DVD. I found the audio problem immediatly and I am far from a critic. It suffered from the classic too quiet too  loud. I also felt the audio didn't quite sync well enough. I can only  assume that they had poor materials to work with. In any case if it was  value over perfection I would still by the value. As always it's good to  have a choice. Do you here that studios?,965260800,,476,3.9789473684210526
41464,4,0782008372,"I really thought (as is so often the case) that the content added by the director's cut really makes this a much better movie. Ideas which one had  to guess at are explained or can be inferred from the extra footage. Too  bad the idiot American editors out there can't figure out that much of the  audiences they are trying to ""protect"" are probably far more  discerning then they are. (i.e. stop trying to help us!)  The audio  track commentary from the producer/director cast was great too. It provided  interesting insights and thoughts behind things. They also discuss many of  the differences between the American and the Eurpoean(=Director's) cut. One  example I got a kick out of: originally they wanted the pro wrestling scene  to be Ice Hockey -- they were trying to portray that modern society is  still violent. Get this - the hockey association (no, I don't remember the  name, I'm not a fan) wouldn't allow it. They didn't want to be portrayed as  a VIOLENT SPORT! Gee, I guess all those fights are really hugs where  someone slipped...  Anyway, to me, often the behind the scenes  commentary and extra features like this are really BIG bonuses one gets  with the DVD versions, which can enrich the thoughtful viewer's expeience  of the film -- and these seem to be often overlooked.  So all things  considered, a very nice value for under ten bucks, and a great story for  certain.
  A thought on the commonly cited audio/video  ""quality"" problems:  I just have a ""normal"" TV with  coaxial input. On this 19"" TV (fed  from the standard audio/video out  through an RF modulator), the video and audio seems as good or better than  a VHS videotape. I wonder if this is a big part of the problem with the  wide discrepency reported in the quality in the reviews - the final viewing  ""hardware setup"". So, just a thought, maybe a direct TV hookup  will make this DVD more enjoyable, masking some of the  ""blemishes""? Might be worth trying for the disappointed fans.

41466,5,0782008372,"This is the movie that started the whole thing.  Now there have been sequels and a TV series, but none of them can compare to this classic of fantasy.  This is one of my favorite movies.  Maybe it's becuase it  juxtaposes sword fighting and modern times.  Maybe it's because you can  never place Lambert's accent.  Maybe it's just because this movie has  something that you can't put your finger on, but will watch whenever it's  on.
This movie is just a classic.  It's about a group of immortals who  have to do battle because 'there can be only one'.  They fight for the  prize and the only way that they can be killed is by beheading.  The battle  leads to modern day New York between the Highlander and the Kurgen (very  bad guy).  The battles are good and the ending to the final battle is  great.
If you've seen any of the other installments, you have to see  this.  The sequels are not good.  The TV series is a pale imitation of this  movie.

The picture quality is  very poor and inconsistent throughout the film. The picture is very grainy  and washed out. The sound levels increase and decrease throughout the film  to the point where I became extremely distracted and began to pay  attenditon to the poor quality of film/sound more than to the film  itself.
I cannot get over the fact that this was THX certified. This  certainly puts a whole new light on the certification standards. I am so  dissapointed that I will be sending several e-mails out to other parties to  voice this opinion. Something that I never, ever do. However, I feel pretty  ripped off after viewing this film.
That said, there is one scene that  does shine. The last battle. Very nicely done and very clear and clean  visually.
Too bad. Otherwise the premise of this film is pretty  interesting. The screenplay varies from exceptional to cheesy. Again,  inconsistency. Someone else should have overseen production on this one.  Could have been a keeper.",963705600,,1261,4.854460093896714

I have no idea what they did to it,  maybe drag the source in mud and jump on it a bit, but it's really -really-  atrocious.

Highlander 2 was their first mistake before a series that ignores the  events of the original film and another movie that does the same but stays  with the story. Don't ask me about the carton. NE ways. Highlander 2 is  everything the first isn't. It's awful except the idea of Connor in the  future was interesting and Connery's Ramirez was again enjoyable, however  it takes a beautiful story of good versus evil and makes a sci fi future  story out of it.

41481,2,0782008372,"Absolutely horrible.  I must have misread the front label, but isn't this film supposed to be THX-certified?  It is beyond any doubt the worst looking film in my DVD collection at this moment.  I even have a Madacy DVD  which looks better than this!  Where to begin....the picture quality is  extremely blocky, I see compression artifacts left and right and up and  down.  The grain of the film is too prominent.  On and on...bottom line: I  think the VHS version of a non-director's cut of Highlander looks better  than this DVD.  And the sound!  Groan.  Sometimes I could barely hear the  dialogue which sounds thin and reedy, and in the next scene the sound  effects come blaring out the speakers.  The sound quality is very uneven;  it almost seems like the producers of this DVD took a monophonic soundtrack  and attempted to make it into 5.1.  Who knows?  As for the extras...HAH!  It is totally disorganized, almost as if someone took a stack of  papers/photos off the desk, scanned them randomly into a computer and  transfered them onto the DVD.  Furthermore, the photo gallery repeats a lot  of the photos (duh) and zips right by at 24 photos a second (duh).  By the  time you realize it, probably 200 pages have gone by before you can hit the  pause button.
So, is there anything to like about this DVD?  Well, it  does show the uncut widescreen version of Highlander as seen in Europe, so  Americans may see a few extra enlightening scenes.  There is a commentary  by the makers of the film, which is of some interest (and which I found to  be more listenable than the actual ""THX-certifed"" soundtrack).  And the price is quite affordable.  Fans of the film will probably want to  buy the DVD, even though it looks and sounds pretty bad (you've been  warned!).
But for the picky DVD collector, for goodness sakes, stay away  from this DVD!",963360000,,1851,4.627329192546584

41483,4,0782008372,"This is really a great movie and now that the DVD is selling so cheaply (I bought mine for 6.99) how can you possibly pass it up. The special effects aren't all that but the costumes and scenery are amazing, and the storyline  though not always the best explained in this movie (though well know to  watchers of the TV show and people interested in the mythos) is still very  intriguing and one of the most original sci-fi/fantasy stories in recent  history. Sean Connery's performance is really enough to justify purchasing  this movie despite the fact that he isn't in it for more than half an hour.  Christopher Lambert isn't bad though and the swordfighting is truly  incredible. I must admit maybe it's my old age but I'm starting to find the  Queen soundtrack a little cheesy and very 80's in its style, but if you can  overlook that I would definitely recommend this movie. However be  forewarned the DVD version isn't much better than the VHS version it  appears the transfer just wasn't done that well. The sound often has to be  turned up to hear background vocals. If you don't have this movie it is  still worth buying the DVD over the VHS if for no other reason for all the  extras you get, but if you already have it on VHS it's your call whether  it's worth buying again I probably wouldn't (though it has been extremely  cheap).",962841600,7,1344,4.514522821576763
41484,2,0782008372,"Mirroring the comments of others, while Highlander is a great movie, the picture quality of the DVD is simply awful - so much so that it detracts from enjoying the film itself.  Stick with the VHS version.",962064000,2,205,4.54054054054054
41485,4,0782008372,"Video - yes that was horrible at first(I'm playing it on an S-Video 29"" screen), especially the Fasil Scene in MSG. I managed to improve the quality a great deal by turning the 'detail' and 'sharpness' all the  way to zero on the video settings of my dvd player. It's a pain to need to  do this for only 1 dvd, however Highlander is the type of movie that's  worth it. (If you can't adjust these settings on your DVD, maybe the same  settings on your t.v. will do the trick -- haven't tried it.)
The LD  director's cut is still superior (more supplement and better video), but  considering how much cheaper DVDs are compared to the prices we used to pay  for LD's it's not bad.
Now on to the movie. Highlander has often gotten  a bad rap. I feel this is mainly because it's the type of movie that can't  be placed neatly into a category which most reviewers like to do. It has a  terrific, fresh plot all the way through (with the only exception being the  romance that should have developed between Brenda and Macleod instead of it  turning into a one nighter - the extras discuss this).
The story is  about immortals who have lived, loved and fought amongst us since the  beginning of time. That's all I should say more would ruin the excellent  experience first-time viewers will have.
I think Amazon is getting rid of  this DVD for some outrageously low price so get it....you'll definitely  enjoy it and watch it a few times just to catch everything -- just remember  to lower the detail and sharpness!
I give the DVD 3 stars because they  could have done a better job on the video so that adjustments would not  have been necessary and they should have included the extra supplement that  was available on the laser.
The movie itself I give 5 stars for a  wonderful, original concept, good acting, etc...

The movie as expected was the same brilliant movie I remember. The  sound was very odd. on a Dolby Pro Logic system it faded horribly all over  the place. It was too loud in places and too quiet in others.
As for the  Director's Cut - This is the exact same version that was released here in  New Zealand for the cinemas, so no bonus there.
The picture quality was  quite shocking. It looked a little like a video tape after about 20 plays.  Just starting to get a bit grainy.
However, at the incredibly low price  this is being offered at recently, I would still recommend buying it if u  are a fan. The extra features and commentary are quite good, and a true  collector will not be without.

The original ""Highlander"" film, starring Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery, the inspiration of the TV shows that came later, its simply a cult classic, with Christopher Lambert (in his BEST performance -along ith MK, HL:TS:TG  and HL:TFD- as the Highlander) playing a murning, depresed, lonely and  tragic hero, Connor McLeod, who must fight other Immortals, until the time  of the Gathering, and Sean Connery playing McLeod's mentor, Juan Sunchez  Villa-Lobos Ramirez (originally Tak-Ne, in the novelization of the film),  who learnes to Connor who to defend himself, to hide his special skills,  until the time of the Gathering.

I don't have nothing to  say. The film is a classic.

41544,5,0782008372,"Highlander was my favorite movie for a few years. I am fascinated by immortality themes  and that is basically what this film is all about. There is also a lot of great sword fights and a bit of romance as well,  which never hurts. Christopher Lambert was born to play this role. His  accent and looks are exotic enough for us to truly believe that he has been  around as long as he says. And let's not forget Sean Connery. He performs  with his usual flair, managing to shine without stealing all of the lime  light.

The story is set in the present but has numerous flash  backs to times historic. We see Macleod's beginnings, when he discovers he  can not die and is cast out of his village accused of being a servant of  the devil. The love of his life adds a little depth to his character and  then we discover how he learned his amazing sword skills. Another immortal,  Ramirez, far older than the young Macleod, takes him under wing as  protection from the enemy of all decent immortals, the Khirghan. And what a  great bad guy he is. The Khirghan's lust for life, death and horror is  boundless. In the end there can be only one. Which makes for a great excuse  for every immortal to duke it out, and the only way to win is decapitate of  the opponent.

Lastly the score needs a special mention.  Queen  created a few dedicated pieces for this film and we also get some old  favorites. The one song that stands out is Freddie's version of New York,  New York, what a ripper. A note of caution though. Do NOT consider watching  the sequel to Highlander as it is excrement. The third movie was tolerable  but not in the same class as the original. And the TV series was passable  but the script is pathetic. If you want to stay pure, only watch the first  movie and do not be tempted by these others that seek to ride on the back  of their betters.",957657600,3,1854,4.298550724637681

The director's commentary is good..and very interesting  during the scenes which were added for the directors cut, however in the  commentary they mention a bar scene which would have been nice to show as a  deleted scene, but its not there. The title page for the DVD is a bland two  color repulic pictures standard page, which is very boring to say the  least.

The DVD transfer is, in  a word, terrible. Whatever film stock was used for the low-light shots  (which is most of the film) was pretty grainy, and the DVD just accentuates  that to an ALARMING degree. Add to that the pixelation artifacts, and the  way certain backgrounds in shots don't move or change their appearance AT  ALL with foreground movement, giving scenes a plastic, cartoonish look.  This is a cheap way to cut down on the DVD's data size, but it shows. I've  seen indie films shot on 16mm that looked better on a VHS dub than this.  Maybe they were shorthanded at the mastering lab that week and let an  intern get a ""big break"", I don't know. The THX certification is  definitely NOT deserved, as the mix on the sound is equally bad, with FX  stomping on dialog in key places.
Having said that, if you are bound and  determined to buy this, Russel Mulcahy's strong grasp of the visual at  least doesn't disappoint. Some of the best match dissolves and scene  transitions to be found anywhere. The DVD should be shown to aspiring film  students:What TO DO with a camera, What NOT TO DO in the mastering lab.",954028800,12,1319,4.460251046025105
41549,2,0782008372,"What an absolute atrocity.  The picture quality on this DVD is the worst I have *EVER* seen.  I'm fortunate to have the same edition on laserdisc, in addition to the original US release on laserdisc, and the quality in both  cases is far superior.  You'll think something is wrong with your DVD  player if you buy this version.  If you can't find the LD, go for  VHS.
Now, that having been said, the MOVIE is my all-time fave.  Love the  idea, love the cinematography, and love the performances of all the actors,  especially Connery.  It's true that the original US cut makes somewhat less  sense than the Director's Cut, but that's a two-edged sword.  The flow of  the original US cut was better, while the Director's cut drags a bit in  places.  Also, the US cut, while ""confusing"" is also mysterious  in a way that made it fun to watch again and again, because you had to  figure out little details that are simply explained in the Director's  cut.
Overall, it's a pity this DVD is such a hack job.  If it's ever  remastered (which it should be), then they should do the same thing they've  done with some other DVD titles -- allow you to select whether you want the  US release or the Director's Cut.  Also, think ANAMORPHIC!",950745600,167,1230,4.486363636363636

I don't know if I bought a remastered  version or if my DVD player is great, but the picture was wonderful.  I  watched the movie with headphones and the sound was great too.  I can't  understand why this DVD transfer is getting such negative reviews.  I have  a cheap Panasonic A120 player and everything came out looking spectacular.

41552,3,0782008372,"THE MOVIE: Who listens to critics? Ignore the bad reviews written at the time of the theatrical release (1985). The plot is original and suspenseful. The action is well-executed and never overdone. The camerawork  is incredible, as are the scene transitions. Sean Connery and Clancy Brown  really bring it home, acting-wise.
THE DISC (DVD): Get the tape. You're  just wasting your money by getting this movie on DVD. The picture is  grainy; 30-year-old movies have been remastered better than this one. The  sound separation is mediocre, and the editing is terrible: expect to turn  up your stereo twice as loud for dialogue, then half as loud for action  scenes. Compared to the DVD, the tape is 99% as good at 66% of the price.  For these reasons, I took a star away from my review of this DVD.",948672000,5,796,4.717391304347826

All of these questions (and more) are answered in the 10th  anniversary edition of this awesome film.  This version includes previously  unviewed scenes that (for some reason unknown to man)were deleted from the  American release. What this version does is enhance the storyline of Connor  Macleod, the immortal who spends centuries hunting down and killing other  immortals.  It gives the audience a fuller understanding of his background  and history, and a fuller appreciation for the remaining immortals who have  come to New York City for the Gathering.  Combine this great story with the  awesome music provided by Queen, and you have one great and original action  film that spawned one of the most worldwide cult followings I have ever  seen.

I've watched many of the TV shows, so I understand the premise of the TV series now that I have seen this movie. However, the  quality is VERY poor. I own the Monty Python DVD, which is I believe is an  older movie than this one, and it has better quality this Highlander DVD! I  can't believe it's THX certified. I think the guys at THX were drunk when  they transferred this movie to DVD, because it's way too grainy, and the  sound could have been improved a little more. If you can look past the poor  picture and somewhat poor sound quality, then this movie is thoroughly  entertaining.",944006400,3,677,4.283464566929134

The only bad thing is the sound(horrible)...its  better than vhs but not much. The people behind this dvd really messed the  thransfer up.

What a complete waste of  time and money (my money that is). Mr. Lambert, Mr. Connery and co. are  rolling over in their respective graves - figuratively speaking of  course!!

41575,3,0782008372,"""Highlander"" is one of the great movies.  I saw it *twice* in the theater when it came out.  It has people to love, a fight worth winning, and a truly despicable villain.  Michael Kamen's score,  embellished by Queen's songs, has long been one of my all-time favorite  soundtracks.  The additional footage in this director's cut finally  explained to me the origin of the catch-phrase ""It's a kind of  magic,"" which has puzzled me for years.
The bad news is the  soundtrack on this album.  In the original theatrical release, every word  of dialogue came through crisply and clearly.  Here, portions of dialogue  come through as barely comprehensible mumbles.  Furthermore, the sound  level varies all over the map, and, especially in the latter half of the  movie, I found myself endlessly fiddling with the volume as one scene would  be almost inaudible and the next scene, played at that same volume, would  assault my eardrums with deadly force.
*This* is one DVD that *won't* be  replacing my prized non-Director's Cut VHS copy of the movie.  At least  with *that* one I can enjoy the soundtrack - all of it.",934761600,11,1113,4.8138297872340425
