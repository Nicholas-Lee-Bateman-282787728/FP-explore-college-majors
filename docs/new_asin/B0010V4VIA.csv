3050432,3,B0010V4VIA,"So bad it's good.  Writer/Director/Producer Jeff Reactor of Corman years collects a gathering of B-Movie actors and aging stars into this otherwise ridiculous horror comedy movie about vampires warring with humans.  With appearances of Sam J.Jones (1980 Flash Gordon), Fred Williamson( Mash 1970, Black Caesar 1973) Christa Campbell(2001 Maniacs), Reggie Bannister(Phantasm 1 through 4) and Kato Kaelin this film has dark humor about it and having such a fine layer of cheese to this film.  If you just need some chuckles and you want to play a rousing game of ""Hey I know that guy!"" then by all means have a great time.",1343347200,5,620,5.0
3050433,3,B0010V4VIA,"Like all good vampires films, it delivers on cleavage. The beginning was good enough to hold my attention. However after the main character re-animated, it went downhill. What started out as a clever campy movie degraded into B grade film. And in my R rated version, the women have sex with their tops on. I would have expected something more physical from super strong vampires: tossing each other around the room, knocking over furniture etc.",1275004800,,444,4.933333333333334

3050435,1,B0010V4VIA,"What a woeful film. It starts with the vampire telling his story, obviously if he's there to tell the story, you know nothing's going to happen to him in the end.

He becomes a 'half-vampire' after contemplating suicide, and finding an ad on TV for those contemplating suicide (sigh) with the opportunity to become vampires!!!

He soon becomes caught in the cross-fire between a war between a gang of full-blood vampires and human vampire hunters.

The fight sequences are dull.

The 'sexy' vampires (such as Christa Campbell) never get down beyond their underwear. Tane McClure, at almost 50! Alana Curry doesn't even get to that!

Jeff Rector is the star, the writer, the producer, the executive producer and the director.

The only thing interesting at all in this film is the list of b-grade actors;
Billy Drago (Vamp, the Untouchables)
Fred Williamson (From Dusk till Dawn)
Carel Struycken (star Trek: the Next Generation (as Mr Hom), the Addams Family)
Christa Campbell (Erotic Confessions)
Tane McClure (Bikini Drive-In)
Vernon Wells (Mad Max 2: the Road Warrior)
Sam J. Jones (Flash Gordon)
Anne Lockhart (Battlestar Galactica (as Sheba), Troll)
Jason Carter (Babylon 5 (as Marcus Cole), Demon Under Glass)
Martin Kove (the Karate Kid)

and so on.",1204070400,33,1255,5.092682926829268

It had some pretty recognizable actors in it, which kept me involved probably longer than if it hadn't.  Bad acting. Cheesy story. Horrible effects. Seemed as if it was maybe some kind of weekend project by a bunch of guys with a video camera.  It was just too painful to finish.

Starts out with a husband Richard and his wife, the day of their anniversary he gets a credit card bill with some outstanding charges from a fancy hotel on it. calling the hotel he learns that darling wifey has a lover who posed as Richard using his credit card to pay for everything. What happened to the good old days when cheaters would sneak off to a hotel pay cash and keep a LOW FROFILE? I mean seriously you 2 morons

Later Richard sees an add answers it and that is how he meets gorgeous seductive brunette Lilith who also happens to be a vampire, they do the deed and it's love at first bite. As events play out he two fall head over heels for each other she is the love of his life and he becomes a vampire. Richard looks for and gets rexenge on his wife and her lover, sweet.

The plot is holier than Swiss cheese, the acting wooden at best, and it has the great fortune of featuring all of the following: a vampire clown, a vampire-themed country and western song, and a hotline which one can call in order to become a vampire. I have watched it with friends on several occasions for the purposes of shouting at the screen and throwing popcorn at this travesty of a film.
