1760806,3,B00006HAXE,"Kevin Zegers and Jack Palance shine in this adaptation of the classic novel.  You probably need a calculator to add up all the different versions of the film, and everybody agrees that the version starring Bobby Driscoll is by far the best - but this one is an enjoyable journey.
The DVD itself is nothing to brag about with very limited ""special features"" - it is obvious it was cheaply produced but the video quality is good.  Worth a viewing by any Kevin Zegers or Jack fan.",1055203200,3,477,4.471264367816092
1760807,4,B00006HAXE,"If you've seen any of the many versions of Treasure Island then you've seen them all.  Whats makes this version at least different, (if not better) is the dramatic change at the end of the story.  I realize its not what the author had in mind, but hey this is hollywood and they reserve the right to alter the story.
The acting ranged from very good to very bad; with Kevin Zegers (Jim Hawkins) probably doing the best acting job in the movie.  Another version, and in my opinion the best to date, features Christian Bale & Charlton Heston in the lead roles.  This version was still one of the better ones though and all in all I give it four stars.",1053302400,3,649,4.295081967213115
1760808,1,B00006HAXE,"Anyone who has actually read the book will be disappointed with this version of the film. Despite pretty good casting, the film is ruined by an unforgivable altering of the story. Peter Rowe owes an apology to all fans of R. L. Stevenson.",1047254400,3,238,4.558139534883721
1760809,1,B00006HAXE,"We rented this out of our love for the Treasure Island story as well as our respect for Jack Palance's acting skills. While Mr. Palance performed well, the story itself was totally twisted. The ""good guys"" became the ""bad guys"" and the ""bad guys"" turned out to be actually the ""good guys"". Par for our modern PC culture which fortunately R. L. Stevenson knew nothing about (and yes, I have read the original story). SPOILER: the story ends by the ""hero"" Long John Silver sailing to Jamaica with Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn (the ""good guys"" of the show were killed during a fight at the treasure -- but the story was so twisted that you were actually glad they received their ""just reward"" in death!). The only reason I rated this a ""1-star"" was because there was not a ""zero-star"" rating.",1046131200,7,785,4.535211267605634

1760837,1,B00006HAXE,"Just finished reading the book to my kids and wanted to show them the movie too. Couldn't even finish watching it, it was so bad.  Poor acting, terrible directing and didn't even follow the story as it was originally written.  There are a couple other Treasure Island movie options I will be exploring.",1455580800,,302,4.679245283018868

1760839,4,B00006HAXE,"Maybe I'm weird but I really enjoyed this laid back little gem. I no longer remember the book that well so am not sure how well it followed but the twist of change of loyalties at the end as well as the tense voyage and skirmishes on the ship and off after reaching the island topped by the final tumultuous battle kept it moving just enough to enjoy it all through. The truly bad guys played their parts well, not over the top or under but just right to be very convincing. If the gun battles had been more accurate (no smoke coming out of some barrels, shooting with their aim too high at times, too fast reloading of some, etc.) I'd give it 5 stars. I am sick today so that may have helped me enjoy it's lower key tone.

1760841,1,B00006HAXE,Watched this with my young son after reading the book to show what we talked about in movie form.  He was very confused by the storyline because the good guys become the bad guys and there's a totally different ending than the classic!  Disappointing.,1444176000,,251,4.681818181818182

1760843,5,B00006HAXE,I loved this movie. Jack Palance was in his best form when he made this one. A truly entertaining version of the classic.,1439596800,,121,4.304347826086956

1760846,2,B00006HAXE,It was OK.  But it lost the suspense of the book as it completely departed from the book.  The ending was weird.,1426204800,,112,4.045454545454546
1760847,1,B00006HAXE,I hate it. This was absolutely the WORST possible version of Treasure Island I can imagine. All the good guys die for Pete's sake. How can they even call this Treasure Island?! This is a quote from my 9-year-old son and Treasure Island expert. He was disgusted. Seriously.,1420156800,,272,4.6875

1760849,3,B00006HAXE,"The movie is generally true to the original plot of the book.  It's not an exciting movie, but you get Jack Palance playing Long John Silver.  The movie wasn't too long, just long enough for a movie like this.",1401840000,,209,4.333333333333333
1760860,1,B00006HAXE,"THIS REVIEW IS ALL CAPITALIZED BECAUSE I'M SCREAMING!
WHAT AN UTTER DISGRACE! HOW, WHY, FOR WHAT POSSIBLE REASON DID THE FOOLS WHO PRODUCED THIS HORROR, REVERSED THE ENTIRE BOOK AND EVERY CHARACTER IN IT!
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!",1369180800,2,227,5.333333333333333
1760861,2,B00006HAXE,"Good Pirate film. Should have been made more for the kids- there were some overly gory shots, and at times it was too wordy and lengthy for the kids. Good production value, cool sets and boats / costumes / set design was impressive. If you like Pirate films, this is for you.",1267920000,,275,4.3076923076923075
1760862,1,B00006HAXE,"Alright, I finally read Treasure Island and decided I needed to see a good interpretation on film. This ain't it. Treasure Planet and Muppet's Treasure Island were both humorous at least. This is the only other version I could find locally. It started off promising enough, then it went downhill fast and never looked back. The settings and costumes were simply beautiful though. If you are hoping for a true-to-book movie this is the farthest thing possible. Frankly, it stinks.",1237248000,3,479,5.0
1760863,5,B00006HAXE,"This film does not stray from the original story until the boat lands on Treasure Island!  It was a bit shocking at first, but Long John Silver's  (Jack Palance) and Jim Hawkins' (Kevin Zegers) superb acting makes this a very enjoyable fantasy to watch!

This is a story of two very elderly men and a very capable  teenage boy! Jim Hawkins, while polite, is incredibly resilient and thinks very fast on his feet. And Long John Silver is not some evil minion, but a man of honor who believes in democracy, no less!

My hats off to the filmmakers for having the courage to re-interpret a classic in such a dramatic fashion. It certainly makes you think about Treasure Island in a totally different way!",1200873600,4,700,4.568
1760864,1,B00006HAXE,"Saw this film only once, and maybe I'm going blind, or the movie affected my brain somehow.....but did anyone else notice that in the closing credits to this horrible film that Jack Palance's name  was spelled ""Plalance""? Gotta wonder who's got the reins when something like that slips by.....",1157932800,,293,4.979591836734694
1760865,4,B00006HAXE,"I got the film because Kevin Zegers was in it. It starts out slow, but by the end I was happy to have watched it. Zegers with a British accent is pretty cute too.",1148601600,,162,3.7941176470588234
1760866,2,B00006HAXE,"After mistakenly getting this 1998 version of TREASURE ISLAND instead of the classic Disney one, I decided I would at least give this film starring Kevin Zegers (Air Bud) and Jack Palance a chance. But... maybe I shouldn't have taken that chance at all.

The film opens out with a scene involving the pirates on Treasure Island, where Flint is having the treasure buried. We are shown how Pew and Long John Silver come to be blind and peg-legged. Billy Bones (Patrick Bergin) then arrives at the Admiral Benbow Inn where a long-haired Kevin Zegers greets him with a dash of rum. Billy Bones felt rightly cast, but Pew was not at the least bit as frightening as Stevenson describes, and Black Dog could have been a bit better as well.

Some of the shots are amazing - on the island and on board the Hispaniola - and Kevin does an okay job as Jim Hawkins, though swinging between sounding like a little girl and a thirteen-year old whose voice just won't stop cracking.

Problems arise in this version due to changes from the original story that just don't quite work that well. We never really SEE Long John Silver and Jim interacting on the boat that much, so we can't possibly understand why the old pirate has taken a liking to the boy. The ending shoot-out was mildly disappointing. However, I did feel that Ben Gunn was cast very well, and it was most humorous to watch him.

All in all, this is mild at best, with a few great cinematic shots, but not enough meat to carry things along.",1136764800,15,1490,4.487084870848708
1760867,1,B00006HAXE,"I had high hopes for this film, as it has plenty of well-known actors. But this director/writer butchered the original story. He went far beyond taking liberties with it...he ruined it. The plot development is horrible...characters don't develop, they simply change in the time it takes to switch scenes. And as other reviewers have noted, the ending is probably the worst part of all. As I watched (painfully), I questioned if the director even bothered to read the book. He took a wonderful, rousing adventure and turned it into a sickening, useless film that I will never watch again, let alone buy.",1123372800,4,602,4.911764705882353
1760868,1,B00006HAXE,"Avoid this deranged piece of garbage at all costs.  The story is so distorted from Robert Louis Stevenson's original that it should probably not be titled ""Treasure Island"".  I understand that sometimes liberties must be taken when making a movie out of a book.  But it really irritates me when Hollywood decides to completely distort the original story because they think that they can do better.  The acting is nothing short of awful.  I think that Jack Palance knew that he was in a turkey and only put in a half hearted effort.

I read Treasure Island as a boy and then again to my children and now I am looking forward to reading it to my grandchildren.  The Charlton Heston version (I wish it would come out in DVD) of this movie is the best, in my opinion, with the Bobby Driscoll/Robert Newton and the Wallace Beery/Jackie Cooper classic not far behind.  All are true to Robert Louis Stevenson's story.  If you want to rent or buy Treasure Island, get one of these.  Better yet, read (or reread) the book!",1092787200,7,1013,4.54696132596685
1760869,1,B00006HAXE,"I love Treasure Island, but I hated this movie. This uninspired version plods along until the end, and then it becomes wretched. Jim teams up with the pirates to kill the Doctor, Squire, and Captain. This movie was so bad I felt sick after watching it. Jack Palance would have made a fine Long John in a better directed version. On the plus side, the camera work is decent and the Hispaniola is beautiful.
Go for the Disney or Charlton Heston version instead.",1059609600,12,459,4.542168674698795

7969040,1,B00006HAXE,"By comparison with the book, the story presented here glorifies and dignifies criminality, in a similar camp to gangster-rap music. For one example, consider the scene where Black Dog meets Dr. Livesey. In the book (and the Turner Broadcasting film starring Charlton Heston), the doctor and former soldier comes across as more manly than the pirate, while in the movie it is the opposite. Generally, this movie deviates from the book by presenting the military men, Livesey and Captain Smollett, as dishonest and weak, and the pirates as basically good guys -- who get away with the treasure in what is presented as a happy ending. The stories children see matter in forming their values; and so this movie is, in its little way, a negative influence on the world.",1466726400,2,764,4.884615384615385
