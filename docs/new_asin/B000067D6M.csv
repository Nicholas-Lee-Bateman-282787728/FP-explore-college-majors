7962547,2,B000067D6M,"It's as if ""The Harrad Experiment"" was copied from a very bad tape.  The only redeeming point is that at least it isn't watered-down version.",1420243200,,141,4.64
7962548,3,B000067D6M,"This item did not meet my expectations.  Based on the description of all three films included, I had expected ""The Harrad Experiment"", which was my target acquisition, to be the complete (uncensored) version.  However, on reviewing the films this did not turn out to be the case.

In addition, the films were grainy, which may be typical of films from that era converted to DVD format.",1413158400,3,385,4.803030303030303
7962549,3,B000067D6M,"HARRAD EXPERIMENT - IMDB says the running time is 97 minutes ... this version runs @1:28 or @88 minutes - are there 9 minutes excised from this film? I did not see the original so i can't tell. I can tell you there is plenty of nudity (no male frontal other than some long shots - so was that what was cut?) but plenty of female nudity as it should be - otherwise, a movie about a free love college makes very little sense without some nudity. The end credits are a little choppy and there are some segments where the editing seems jerky - clearly they did not remaster from a pristine negative ... it looks like a grindhouse print unspooling at a $1 theater ... so, most likely this version lost some running time just from putting the reels together which that explains away a few minutes of the difference in running time. IMDB lists the UK running time at 91 minutes so then only 2-minutes are lost if this is the UK print - which means a few seconds here and there because of the jerky cuts-splices and maybe the loss of the lead actor's frontal nudity? The story seems pretty complete - not exactly great storytelling but the women are attractive and the nudity copious - plus Tippi Hendren in a bra standing out in a field. An interesting period piece - worthwhile for a look.

The other two films don't amount to much - GEORGE SEGAL and KAREN BLACK are in BORN TO WIN. Another gritty urban film of the early 1970's ... for those who know NY well, it's fun to see the mean & dirty streets of NYC 40 years ago but other than that, not much to the film.

KATHERINE - the Sissy Spacek movie is not very interesting plus they made her up like a guy so - guess they figured her character was so ugly, they had to make her so?

But $6 for three films and probably the only (mostly?) unedited version of the Harrad Experiment floating around makes it worthwhile. For NYers, it's an amusing travelogue back in time in BORN TO WIN. And while KATHERINE is ultimately not much of anything, you do get to see a lot of young actors we all know from their future work so good casting for a not so great project.

None of the three films are remastered - they seem to be transferred from random working prints but then none of these films are lost classics and it's much better to view them imperfectly for $2 a movie ... so a solid deal for film fans.

Make sure the other reviews you are reading refer to THIS 3-movie DVD edition and not some other. The reviews collected here seem to be a hodge podge of releases",1238544000,8,2507,4.258403361344538

7962551,1,B000067D6M,"I bought this a few years ago because I wanted to see two of the three movies(Born to Lose, and The Harrad Experiment)and I though that with Sissy Spacek, how bad of a movie could Katherine be ?

 Well, Robert Deniro stars in Born To Lose(for about five minutes playing cop number two).

 If you like George Seagal, then this is a decent movie-Segal give a good performance as a down on his luck drug addict who's caught betweeen the cops and the dealer that he ripped off.

 Katherine seems to be a kind of retelling of the Patty Hearst kidnapping saga(sort of).(Henry Winkler(in a really early roll) and Art Carney(I guess the rent was due)also star-To be honest I was bored after 10 minutes and went ahead to --

 The Harrad Experiment--Don Johnson stars as a student in the first Co-ed dorm at Harrad College-again to be honest although I like this movie,the print was so bad(jumps,fading colors) that I couldn't really enjoy the movie.(Tippi Hedren and James Whitmore also star).

 So there you have it ,three movies with one decent print(Born to Lose).Buy at your own risk.",1114300800,13,1079,4.661375661375661
