4231286,5,B003YM3QY8,This was one of the best television series ever.  The quality is good considering the technology of that era.  Great product!,1380931200,2,125,4.904761904761905
4231287,1,B003YM3QY8,"I already had an Amos & Andy collection in my library but many of the episodes were of very poor quality. This collection is outstanding. Top quality audio, video and packaging. A great old TV series that has received criticism for a couple stereo types but compared to todays TV this show is mild. The shows plots are hilarious. I am in the process of purchasing several more items from Bo's Trading Post. My first purchase has been excellent.",1380931200,,444,4.632911392405063

4231289,5,B003YM3QY8,"You'll laugh with these great comic actors, not at them. Spencer Williams, for example, was the antithesis of his character, Andrew Hogg Brown. Brilliant casting. Brilliant writing. Before Norm Crosby fractured the English language, there was George Kingfish Stevens and Andrew H. Brown.

This was the early 1950s and the Confederate flags waved unabashed in the southern United States. Black people were segregated, second class citizens then. Though made in Hollywood, California, and set in Harlem, New York, you will notice these black characters interacting with white characters with not a trace of a race barrier, no color difference, between them.  Amazing for the time.

If you can laugh at yourself then you won't be able to hold back the laughter as you watch each TV episode.

Regarding the quality of the prints, the producers could have tried harder on a few episodes to find better copies. Where or where are the original negatives to this wonderful comic television series?",1374883200,4,989,5.1625
4231290,5,B003YM3QY8,"The video and quality are excellent and every episode is titled.  One episode even includes an intro commercial for Blatz beer.  I thought I was back in the old days when Milwaukee really was the beer capitol!  I highly recommend this collection.
It is well worth the price.  Great acting.  Great plots.",1371686400,13,303,4.75
4231291,5,B003YM3QY8,"What an awesome collection. I bought this for my husband's birthday and he loves it. He has purchased 3 other Amos and Andy collections on Amazon and all of them were disappointingly poor. All of these DVDs have custom menus where you can choose to play all of shows on a DVD or you can pick the one you want to watch. The quality is excellent on both video an audio. There are a few shows of lesser quality but are still great to watch. I can see why the producer decided not to leave them out of this total collection. The CD albums... what can I say, they're wonderful. My husband couldn't believe the audio quality. Now he can play Amos and Andy radio shows in the car on the way to and from work. These are full fidelity... high fidelity shows, unlike the poor quality MP3s in other collections we've bought. Beautiful packaging too. the other collections he had purchased looked home made and amateurish. I thought the price was a little high at first, but it was worth it to finally make the old man happy. Thanks SCP Media.. whoever you are. I'll look for your other products on Amazon.",1281484800,12,1094,4.394088669950739

8409674,4,B003YM3QY8,"Arrived quickly after ordered.  It is a very old TV series, and the episodes I have viewed have been like they were broadcast on TV.
It would have gotten ""5"" Stars, but on some episodes a ""pop-up"" from the producer will appear, then disappear.
I do recommend buying this one over the others offered.",1468800000,2,299,4.537037037037037
8409675,5,B003YM3QY8,Just as remembered as a kid. Still funny and video quality is excellent,1454198400,,71,4.538461538461538

8409677,2,B003YM3QY8,"The video quality varies. Some are OK, some are miserable, some are almost too poor to watch.",1414022400,2,93,4.529411764705882
8409678,5,B003YM3QY8,really brought back great memories of a time when people enjoyed life and the quality was great.,1411430400,,96,4.705882352941177
8409679,3,B003YM3QY8,"I found this show funny and interesting. If you are buying this set hoping for the same audio and video quality as the Three Stooges, you will be disapointed. The video is simmalar but a little better than Youtube, and the audio is crisp and mostly clear. For the price, I was hoping for factory pressed, but The set was recorded on DVD-R media with painted labels. At least they were not piled on top of each other. If price was a little lower I would give it five stars.",1403049600,6,472,4.2555555555555555
8409680,3,B003YM3QY8,"I appreciate the seller's speedy shipment of this beautifully boxed set. But, it did not quite meet my expectations in view of the high ratings given it by other reviewers. Maybe, I was just unlucky in not getting the same quality sets they all received. I quick-browsed the entire set and was only able to find 40 some episodes of very good-to-excellent quality. After having purchased previous complete sets at lower prices, but of even lower quality from other sources, I had really built up my hopes to having at last found the ideal quality set in this 60th Anniversary Collection. I do not blame the seller, for I do not believe him to be the manufacturer.",1400716800,2,662,4.666666666666667
8409681,5,B003YM3QY8,"Good quality considering age of the originals. Timeless story lines and unforgetible actors. Go ahead and buy, you will be laughing too.",1399075200,,136,5.2272727272727275
8409682,5,B003YM3QY8,This collection was more than I expected. I had the VHS and they were so so quality. The quality on these DVDs is really remarkable for the age of the show. I haven't gotten through all 70+ episodes but I think so far one has been grainy. I am very pleased with this purchase.,1391817600,2,276,4.12962962962963
