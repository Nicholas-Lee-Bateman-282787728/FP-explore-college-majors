8360500,3,B002AWM0TU,"Vacanze per un massacro (1980)

""Vacation Massacre"" is yet another in the long thread of (Italian) films that mimic the 1972 US exploitation hit ""Last House on the Left"". Technically the film is obviously very low budget-nearly amateurish, Dallesandro makes a totally over satisfying (and under satisfying ) acting performance but he's very entertaining, in this minimal low-budget Italian action cinema performance. All in one, a film that I like a lot, probably its not for everybody's taste.",1385510400,,494,5.333333333333333
8360501,4,B002AWM0TU,"This comes from the Dallesandro period in Italy where he starred in quite a few 'bad guy' crime dramas! Pretty violent and twisted, but Joe does a pretty good job in the acting department! Warning-one company has priced this at an exorbitant price-beware! Raro video has reissued it for about $20 with a good print and extensive  liner notes about the actors, director and the film. Its a must have if you're a Dallesandro fan!",1376006400,,427,4.693333333333333
