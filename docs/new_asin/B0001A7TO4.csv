8008982,4,B0001A7TO4,"Chronicles the life of a Canadian boxer who had some success and some loses. Fought some contenders and had contracts to fight for a championships but chances were lost. Did fight one championship but questionable outcome.

Due to Ali's unwillingness to enter the military Chuvalo gets a chance to fight Ali in Canada. Features many interviews and much fight footage. Was unaware of him. Similar to Chuck Wepner.",1468972800,,412,5.0588235294117645

8008984,5,B0001A7TO4,"What a great dvd about a solid contender from the greatest era of heavyweights. This man George Chuvalo was one tough embry! He fought all the top men from the 60's and 70's and was never Knocked down in his career. He fought Muhammad Ali,Joe Frazier,George Foreman,Jerry Quarry,Floyd Patterson,and many more top heavyweights of his day and never once tasted the canvas. I think he would have been a champion if he fought in another era where the talent pool wasn't as deep. This is just a sound documentary on part of his career. Alot of thrilling action packed fight clips and highlights. A must watch for any fan of Boxing History. As a side note although i have never met George Chuvalo,he seems like one of great people in boxing. I have seen him on T.V. and in many specials and you just get the feeling that he is a geniune nice guy. Very down to earth and a gentle giant type just like George Foreman. Two of the greatest statesmen for boxing in my opinion. After all that punishment that both Foreman and Chuvalo have taken they are still sharp as a tacks. I also have a feeling that if either of them desired they could still gear up and give any young heavyweight today a fight they wouldn't soon forget. Maybe they couldn't go as many rounds now but they would still be hell early on im sure. I have seen clips of Chuvalo hitting the heavey bag at age 70 and his left hook looks like it could knock down a house. Great dvd entertaining from start to finish.",1342915200,,1469,4.384615384615385
8008985,5,B0001A7TO4,"I purchased this DVD on the advice of a reader who agreed with my review of the book ""Fearless"", which is about George Chuvalo. (We both agreed that it was terrible, as it was written for a child.) The Last Round gives a great account of the life and career of a fine man and a courageous fighter, whom I have gotten to know from my annual attendance at the International Boxing Hall of Fame Induction Weekend in Canastota, NY. George Chuvalo fought the best of the heavyweight division at a time when some of the all-time greats were active, and never once was he knocked off his feet. He held his own with Muhammad Ali, and he was robbed in his bout with Ernie Terrell. Today, he is a lucid and well-spoken man, who shares with me an ability to remember dates. In both The Last Round and Facing Ali, he shares his wealth of stories with the viewer. (One which I heard him tell was about the Toronto promoter who called him to say he was arranging a bout for him with Sonny Liston. The very next morning, George turned on his TV to the news that Liston had been found dead in his home, and he had been dead for at least a week!) George deserves a full-scale biography or autobiography.

PS: I just read George's autobiography, and it is great!! See my review above.",1313366400,,1266,4.319327731092437
8008986,5,B0001A7TO4,"I recently viewed  this again after watching ""Thrilla In Manila"" and this is as good  as that is flawed.  I enjoyed not only learning  more about George Chuvalo (a fighter who never  was knocked  off  his feet  in  decades in the ring ) but I also found  the information about ALi and what was going  on in his life/career in the 60's much better than  on most  of Ali's own programs!

If you are a historical fight fan this should be of interest to  you...if you are an ALi fan absolutely and I believe even non-fight fans would  enjoy.",1245283200,,537,4.2727272727272725
8008987,4,B0001A7TO4,"In 27 rounds spanning two fights, Canadian heavyweight George Chuvalo was never intimidated by Muhammad Ali. And it just may have been a case of an overmatched contender who had a world champion's heart and enough tricks in his unorthodox style to be on his feet when the final bells rung.

Director Joseph Blasioli chronicles the March 29, 1966, Ali title defense in Toronto, Canada, where - at the height of his ring prowess - he captured a 15-round unanimous decision over the game Chuvalo.

Released in 2004, the documentary uses archival footage, clips from previous fights and interviews with Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee, boxing historian Bert Randolph Sugar and abrassive columnist Jimmy Breslin to describe a match that is forgotten amongst the historic fights that defined Ali as one of the greatest champions ever.

In a rematch on May 1, 1972, in Vancouver, Chuvalo again demonstrated his veteran ring savvy in losing another decision to Ali, this time in 12 rounds.

Chuvalo was good enough to dream in this oftentimes brutal sport that he was one well-placed combination away from capturing the heavyweight title. In The Last Round, Chuvalo shows that a champion may not always be the fighter who leaves the ring with the victory for the record book.",1170547200,12,1263,4.971563981042654
8008988,5,B0001A7TO4,"George Chuvalo was always just a shade below the best heavyweights of his day, and that was a day with some great fighters. If you watch an unedited tape of his bout with Ali you will see that it was a much closer fight then many now believe. He punished Ali severely to the body. Also, he took the fight on short notice.

George later met with trajedy in his life when he lost a son and daughter to drugs and his wife to suicide. He now has a foundation that helps drug dependent people.

Chuvalo is not an old punch drunk pug. He is lucid and intellegent, a testament to the fact that he won the majority of his fights and didn't take many beatings.

In a dvd boxing market that is oversaturated with Ali videos (why no Ali Frazier I, where Ali lost), it is good to see a decent man and good fighter get the recognition he deserves.",1116633600,17,834,4.167701863354037
8008989,5,B0001A7TO4,"This story is basically told through George Chuvalo, Canada's greatest heavyweight ever. This is a story of a real ""Rocky Balboa"" and the riviting documentry takes us from George's humble beginnings in Toronto right up to his shot at the heavyweight title in his unforgettable battle with Muhammad Ali. This film has some of the best fight footage I've ever seen that takes you into the ring and behind the scenes and in the locker rooms.
  Great commentary not only from Chuvalo but from Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee, writers Jimmy Breslin, Burt Sugar and others connected to the fight scene here in it's last glory days of the 1960's.",1089504000,19,635,4.81651376146789
