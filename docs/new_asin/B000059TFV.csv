1409331,4,B000059TFV,"Released in 1955, ""The Kentuckian"" is one of only a couple films directed by Burt Lancaster.

THE STORY takes place during the presidency of James Monroe circa 1820. Lancaster plays Eli Wakefield, a Kentuckian who desires more room to breath in Texas. Still in Kentucky, they blow their ""Texas money"" on freeing a beautiful indentured servant, Hannah (Dianne Foster). They don't get past the next frontier town where Eli takes up with his brother in the tobacco business and Hannah gets a job as a bar matron. Eli's dreams of Texas are sidetracked when he meets up with a schoolmarm (Diana Lynn) who encourages him to settle down and make a family with her. The problem is that Eli's son prefers Hannah and doesn't want to give up their Texas dream. Meanwhile feuders are hot on Eli's trail, not to mention malevolent local businessman with a whip (Walter Matthau).

Some highlights include:

- Lush Eastern locations. The film was shot in Levi Jackson State Park, Kentucky (near London), as well as Owensboro, Kentucky, which is on the Ohio River, and Rockport, which is just across the river in Indiana. The river depicted in the film is supposed to be the Tennessee River (I think), but it was shot on the Ohio. In any event, although ""The Kentuckian"" is classified as a Western, it's actually an Eastern.

- The film offers a good glimpse of what the Eastern USA was like back when it was still a frontier -- the cabin-styled houses, sleeping in the woods, etc. No internet, cable, video games, DVDs or microwaves. People actually sat down with other people and communed.

- The story is realistic, albeit with some lame dialogue. Regardless,you don't have to worry about any goofiness or unbelievable bits that plague some 50's Westerns, except for the too-wooden-they're-funny feudalists.

- Back then a huge riverboat coming to town was an exciting attraction. Americans today, by contrast, get all excited over the shenanigans of some celebrity.

- Dianne Foster (Hannah) is a beautiful redhead. One wonders how a woman like this would stay single very long on the frontier.

- The whip fight with Matthau is great. Lancaster is almost whipped to shreds (!).

- Loyalty is a sub-theme here. Eli's son is loyal to Hannah and never warms up to the schoolmarm, although there's it's clear that there's nothing wrong with the latter. And Hannah is loyal to the man who delivered her from bondage (Eli), despite his infatuation with the marm.

- I liked the bit on Eli being a laughing stock because of a worthless freshwater pearl, but he gets the last laugh with a letter from the President (or is it?) and additional help.

- Lastly, Lancaster is a likable protagonist with his charismatic joy-of-living persona; he's humble and respectful, the antithesis of Eastwood's amoral and lifeless 'man with no name' a decade later.

The film runs an hour and 44 minutes.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Kentuckian"" is breath of fresh air and I enjoyed it from beginning to end for all the above reasons; it's sort of like ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) of its era, albeit no where as good. It's innocuous and easy-going, but sometimes surprisingly brutal (the dog fight and whip fight). If you can acclimate to the style of filmmaking of the mid-50s it's worth checking out.

1409332,3,B000059TFV,"The Kentuckian is the only film that Burt Lancaster ever directed, and while it is not a bad film, it is not up to the caliber of Lancaster's many great Westerns.

In The Kentuckian, Lancaster plays the titular character, a 17th century frontiersman on his way to take his son to live in wide-open Texas country. He stops along the way to visit his brother, played by John McIntire. But Lancaster gets involved with a former indentured servant, and runs afoul of a mean Walter Matthau (who likes to brandish a whip, no less), and Lancaster and the boy's plans are altered.

The Kentuckian is entertaining in several ways, but not as good as Apache, Gunfight at The OK Corral, and his other Westerns. But the acting is very good, and this movie was nothing for Lancaster to be ashamed of, so watch this film when you have a chance. It's not the best, but you won't feel like you've wasted your time.",1168387200,4,898,4.5030674846625764
1409333,4,B000059TFV,"This is one of my favorite films starring Burt Lancaster.  Parts of it filmed in Levi Jackson State Park in London, Kentucky.  My Grandmother introduced me to this wonderful film many years ago.  It remains a favorite.  I would reccomend this as a film that is worth the time devoted to it's viewing.  Beautiful scenery and just very entertaining. My Grandmother always liked to relate to me of the many visits by the film cast and crew (including Mr. Lancaster) to the little restaurant where she worked in London, Ky.  Give this film a try...they don't make them like this anymore.  Classic story and classic actors !

1409334,4,B000059TFV,"A fine family classic in the tradition of The Proud Rebel, Treasure of Lost Canyon, and Rachel and the Stranger.

Burt Lancaster is a widower raising his son in the Kentucky wilderness, which has become too tame for them at the time of this story, so they've saved enough for a river boat ticket to Texas.  But a bond girl (Dianne Foster) shows them kindness, so they buy her freedom with their ""Texas money.""  They tentatively plan to take her with them when they save up enough money again, so Lancaster takes a job with his brother (John McIntyre) and Foster works for a local bar keeper played by Walter Matthau in his first screen role.  Meanwhile some feuders are pursuing Lancaster just because of his name (Watefield), and bound to catch up soon.

There's an interesting riverboat scene and some plot developments (Diana Lynn) that come between father and son; but the best part is a whip fight with Matthau, a very interesting whip-cracking character who makes this movie worth seeing for his scenes alone.  John Carradine is also outstanding as a snake-oil salesman, and the rest of the cast is fine as well.",1117065600,11,1118,4.707692307692308
1409335,5,B000059TFV,"wow, we've got some pretty heavy critics here! my guess is that anyone who doesnt like the kentuckian is either a sissy or reviews way to many movies and needs to get some sunshine. as a boy i was fasinated by this movie. it was easy to be romanced by this film because of the boy and his dog and how he prefered hannah over the school marm, and is ultimatly right about her in the  in the end. the movie knows exactly where its going(if you are paying attention)and has a beautiful way of showing you what things must have been like back then,i.e. the singing black entertainers prompting lancaster of ""texas""""texas"" texas""!, when the boat comes to town. this is a wonderful movie for children that haven't yet been polluted  by the endless amount of crap that unfortunatly is in abundance nowadays. this film still has enough drama and human interest with an actual, real substance for any age. its a mere record of what life was like in one part of the world at one time and its done quite well if you let the movie take you instead of find whats wrong with it.",1073520000,28,1064,4.3686868686868685
1409336,3,B000059TFV,"One of only two films directed by Lancaster, ""The Kentuckian"" is neither a rousing success nor a glaring disaster. The direction is not all that stylish, but it is no embarrassment. Bernard Herrmann adds to the picture with his musical score.
The story is about Kentucky frontiersman Big Eli, and his son Little Eli, fleeing an infamous family feud and looking for a new life in Texas. They stop along the way to free a bondswoman from her contract, which costs them all of their ""Texas money"", the funds set aside for passage to Texas.
Big Eli goes to work for his brother (John McIntire), in the tobacco business, and life among townspeople changes his plans, much to his son's dismay.
There is romance, and some pretty fair action with Lancaster in a whip fight. The best moment is Lancaster rushing to reach a shooter as he reloads his flintlock rifle in real-time.
Walter Matthau has a good turn as a menacing town boss, and John Carradine does a marvelous portrayal of a medicine man/snake oil salesman. Una Merkel plays Eli's sister-in-law.
Dianne Foster is ravishing as the freed bondswoman Hannah. She guest-starred in a ton of TV classics in the 50's and 60's, including ""Wagon Train"", ""Perry Mason"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Honey West"", ""Petticoat Junction"", and ""Route 66"".
At times, the picture does not seem to know where it's going. At other times, the picture is very cohesive. The DVD transfer isn't bad, either. Well worth a viewing, ""The Kentuckian"" is a real treat for Lancaster fans.",989798400,19,1497,4.828793774319066

1409369,2,B000059TFV,"The Kentuckian, 1955 film

A man and a boy cross a river with their dog Pharaoh. They are going to Texas (which attracts other settlers). Pharaoh barks, a horn recalls him. The man dreams of Texas as an answer to crowded Kentucky. There is a dogfight. Elias Wakefield is held as suspicious. [No Miranda warning?] A woman feeds his son, she is indentured servant. There is a family feud too. Two men are hunting Wakefield. But a bondswoman lifts a key to free Elias. The Sheriff finds them and will take them back. But a deal is made for their freedom, and they continue their journey with Hannah Bounder. Youve got take things as they are. They must earn their Texas money there. They fish for mussels in the river. One mussel has a whopper pearl. A windbag sells medicine to the gullible. Will he buy a pearl? President Monroe buys pearls. [Is this a joke?]

Miss Suzy teaches school. Will little Eli learn his letters? Suzy plays the piano and sings [for entertainment]. Is any man too old for school? Elias is told of the trick. Little Elias is taunted at school, he answers back. Elias is taught about the quality of tobacco leaves by Zach. Ely learns to not turn his back to the other children. The hear the steamboat whistle. A man asks for volunteer emigrants, he describes the richness of Texas. [No mention of the Comanche Indians there.] Ely apologizes for disrupting class. Hannah offers Elias the money for Texas; she sold herself into bondage to Bodine. Elias and his son go hunting and forget to visit Miss Suzy. There is a letter from President Monroe for Zach (with money). [Note the type of letter envelope.] Elias is sent on a business trip. There is gambling on the steamboat. [Note the shills to entice gambling.] Nine wins! They leave the steamboat quickly! Eliad buys for the crowd. [Easy come, easy go.] Elias new clothes marks him as a businessman, not a hunter or laborer.

Elias has settled in. Two men show their prowess with a bullwhip. One man instigates a fight between two boys. I dare you! One boy has a bullwhip! His father is called, he knows what Bodine did. There is a fight, Elias is losing. But the fight is equalized. Wakefield wins and is lauded by the crowd. There is a new development for Elias and Suzy. No Texas? Little Ely accuses his father of lying. [Do circumstances affect opinions or judgments? Yes, you have to adjust for changed circumstances.] Suzy tells what Hannah did. A horn tells of little Elys changes [you don't see this]. The two Throne men are at Bodine home, they will wait for Elias. They tell Bodine what to do! [He squealed!] Hannah loads the musket. Elias quickly crosses the stream before a man can reload? Are they safe now? They will go to Texas.

This story is taken from Felix Harts popular novel The Gabriel Horn. Is it an example of revisionist history? Do some parts seem implausible? I doubt that young Ely would not have a firearm of his own (if he could afford it). This story is unusual as having a bonded servant as part of its story; this is usually censored from academic history. Many immigrants would finance their trip to America by indenture. [Its not too different from going into debt to pay for a college education, isn't it?] I wonder if they planned a sequel to this story? James Madison was President from March 1809 to March 1817. The year 1816 had one of the coldest summers ever recorded. A volcano explosion generated dust that limited sunshine for warmth and crops.

1409387,5,B000059TFV,"THE KENTUCKIAN is pure Americana. This is a fantastic and breathtaking cinematic backwoods tale about America in the early 18th century from Felix Holt's novel The Gabriel Horn. Burt Lancaster directed this film with a rather somber and endearing hand and played the central character. A father and his son set out across Kentucky to reach Texas and encounter a very cynical lot of humanity living in the town of Humility in solid allegorical fashion. Father and son become embroiled in several obstacles that impede and threaten their dreams of Texas. The beautifully haunting Appalachian score by Bernard Herrmann sets the evocative mood of this film embracing human desires, wants and needs of the soul and all the fears and obstacles that must be encountered along the way that characterize the American frontier spirit. Despite disparaging critical reaction to Lancaster's direction, this film contains some very memorable scenes for anyone who has seen it. The reloading of the flintlock rifle scene, President Monroe's letter on the fresh water pearls, and the bullwhip confrontation between Walter Matthau and Lancaster are all unforgettable moments in this film. I think Lancaster did both a fantastic job of acting and directing in THE KENTUCKIAN. It is one of my favorite films.",1337731200,3,1289,5.231884057971015

But in the meantime they will have to experience the expected clash between their ways of living and the civilization.

The duel between Lancaster and Mathau (the ace of the whip), the stare of stars in the middle of the night and the rite of initiation at the moment his son plays the horn, becoming a man (whose analogy with Sigmund is more than obvious), are a treat.

A heartfelt Western, a delight for all the family to watch.",1298246400,,643,4.341666666666667
1409389,5,B000059TFV,"This is an excellent, typical, and enjoyable 1955 Burt Lancaster film. Lancaster plays an uneducated hunter from Kentucky who left his home state with his son, who adores him, his dog, and a long horn that both he and his son understand that his son will only be able to blow and produce a sound when he is grown. They leave to escape the crowdedness of Kentucky and to settle in the open spaces of Texas. They have $210, just enough to pay for a ship to Texas.

 On their way to the river, walking all the time, they come across a beautiful white enslaved/bounded woman who they buy free for all the money they have. The three and the dog make it to Lancaster's brother's house, by the river. They need to work there to make money for their passage to Texas. Lancaster, an unsophisticated man, is duped by his brother and mocked by the local citizens, but finds a way, by using simple common sense, to gain the admiration of many, but not all of the locals.

 In Kentucky, Lancaster's family was in a feud with another family, and two men of the feuding family follow Lancaster and are determined to kill him. Complicating the matter, Lancaster feels that he is in love with a local school teacher and decides to give up his plan to go to Texas. This causes a rift with his son.

Will he resume his plan to go to Texas or stay to marry the school teacher and educate his son? What will happen to the freed beautiful woman? Will the two feuding men be able to kill Lancaster? What happens to the local man, an expert with a whip, who dislikes Lancaster and wants to kill him? Will Lancaster's son grow to blow the horn?",1293148800,4,1619,4.33003300330033
1409390,4,B000059TFV,"Burt Lancaster produced, directed, and starred in this slice of Americana based on the equally enjoyable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gabriel-horn/dp/B0007FJK6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gabriel horn</a>.  He plays Elias Wakefield, known as ""Big Eli,"" a widower and backwoodsman who, like Dan'l Boone, has found that he needs more elbow room--though the outbreak of a family feud with the Fromes doesn't help matters any.  So he and his 10-year-old son Little Eli (Donald McDonald) and their hound Pharaoh set out for Texas, which has just been opened to American settlers, and where they hope they'll find country that's like Kentucky used to be.  Passing through an unfriendly community, they're helped by a bound-girl named Hannah (Dianne Foster) whose indenture, as a matter of honor, Eli buys out with the money he'd saved for their new home.  Now he has to stop and seek work with his older brother Zach (John McIntire), a dealer in tobacco who's determined to civilize him.  And his growing attraction to the local schoolmistress, Miss Susie (Diana Lynn), almost makes him yield--until his rivalry with the neighborhood bully, tavernkeeper Stan Bodine (Walter Matthau in his screen debut), and the arrival of two pursuing Fromes, force him to take a long hard look at what he really wants.

Lancaster plays his soft-spoken but true-to-his-own-code character very well, and puts across on an individual scale the conflict between ""frontier"" and ""progress"" that occupied a large part of the American stage for almost 300 years.  Torn between the lure of far places and adventure, family loyalty, two loves, an unasked-for feud, and the importunings of empresario Pleasant Tuesday Babson (John Litel), who wants him to sign on as his second-in-command, Eli must walk a confused path and try to decide where he and his son will fit best.",1278115200,,1895,5.447098976109215

This is a fun picture with no disappointments.",1244073600,4,403,4.534246575342466
1409392,3,B000059TFV,"The Kentuckian(1953) is a fairly well made pseudo-Western/Adventure/Drama from first time director, Lancaster.

He stars in this as a Kentucky backwoods man travelling with his son and dog through the country in an attempt to start a new life in Texas. There's trouble along the way as society tries to make Lancaster conform to a much more ""stable"" form of life. Meanwhile, two killers are on his trail, gunning for him due to an old family feud.

Lancaster directs the film well, employing lots of beautiful natural scenery to create a great sense of place. Technicolor was just right for this film and highlights the adventure.

The acting is just fine, particularly the star. He gets good support from Walter Matthau(in his film debut) as a villainous, whip cracking scoundrel and John Carradine as a bombastic, medicine man.

However, the film seems disjointed at times. Despite two really good action set pieces(Lancaster's fight against Matthau and a whip and Lancaster rushing across a stream to stop a killer loading his rifle in real time) the film at times moves a sluggish pace. The romance is stiffly handled and just ignored eventually. Even the film's main purpose seems to get lost amongst many episodic moments.
While the film is entertaining and worth seeing for the performances and those two action sequences, it's not an essential.

DVD is presented in letterbox and it's a pretty good print. There's also a Theatrical Trailer.",1243296000,,1448,5.016666666666667

7934124,3,B000059TFV,One of Lancasters rare Directed films. Doesnt quite work as the tone shifts from almost serial like action to family/cultural drama. It often seems to be a generic Lancaster film. The last act is pretty exciting though.,1526256000,,219,4.945945945945946

7934126,4,B000059TFV,"So glad this classic is now available in Blu-ray. Burt Lancaster stars in and directed this colorful adventure tale that features the screen debut of Walter Matthau. Though the film often veers into melodrama and some of the performances might seem a bit hammy to a modern audience, there's a pleasing decency about the whole affair that's kinda refreshing. Overall, it's an entertaining, great-looking film that's even more enjoyable in Blu-ray, with a rousing score by the great Bernard Herrmann. Highly Recommended",1521676800,,517,5.317073170731708

The sound is sharp and clear. Great frontier movie,father & son movie, a movie with good morals and intention. Burt Lancaster is perfect
as ""The Kentuckian"" and does a great job Directing! Walter Mathau is one of the greatest ""movie"" villains of all time. Dianne Foster does a great job. I miss old movies like this that are about pride & honor and have a message. Beautiful scenery,tender moments,great action and family friendly. They don't make movies like this anymore. The Kentuckian has never looked or sounded better. Good Job Kino!",1517875200,2,698,5.025862068965517

Sure the movie can be returned, at my cost and no refund will be given because it is past the return period.  so if I send it back, I pay and and am out more money--keep it and I am still not satisfied with the product.",1508371200,,396,3.9873417721518987
