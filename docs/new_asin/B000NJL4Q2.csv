I am a nut for food movies and feel I had extra patience with it due to the subject matter.  I wanted to love it.  So... when I tell you that, to me, this was possibly the worst movie on the face of the planet - (and I own Plan Nine from Outer Space)- you know that I was at the very least ""disappointed"".  It was a terrible waste of great talent -a lost opportunity - and a couple hours of my life I will never get back.",1199145600,7,662,4.030534351145038
