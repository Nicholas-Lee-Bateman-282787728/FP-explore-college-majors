605987,3,6303223052,"Multiple Maniacs is not Waters' best film, that honor goes to his Female Trouble (due for re-release sometime this year), but is full of typical Waters surprises. Divine stars as Lady Divine and stands out as the best  performer in the film. What makes this film stand out the most is the fact  that the performers don't sound like they're reciting dialogue (like in his  other films), but they're just rambling whatever comes to their mind.  Unfortunately, the movie's most famous scene, the rosary job, is too  offensive to view for most, me included. I could stand the dog poop in Pink  Flamingos, but not this! Catholics are fore-warned. The lobster scene is  hilarious and bizarre. The ending is well-acted, surprising, and a sad  reflection on America's view on violence in 1970. By far the most  interesting thing about this movie is its fictional link to the Manson  murders, which is historical and interesting. It also gives the viewer  insight into Waters' fascination with crime! Those who don't like sloppy  cinematography and have only seen his polished color films are given a fair  warning.",924652800,5,1106,4.945652173913044
606068,5,6303223052,"This is my latest discovery of the John Waters back catalogue of Trash cinema. He is undoubtedly the trashiest and best at this. One of Divine's first forays into film making and the strangest yet. In Multiple Maniacs Lady Divine (Divine) is the focus of a group of traveling misfits who make a living out of murder and mayhem under the guise of entertainment. Unsuspecting patrons attend the Dark Lady Divine's Cavelcade of Perversions. This quasi freakshow features all sorts of bizarre and erotic grossout activities for everyone to enjoy while the patrons get robbed and assaulted at gunpoint. Sounds like a Waters' movie plot to me. Divine is joined by Dreamland stars the Late David Lochary, Edith Massey,the late Cookie Muller(Divine's daughter),Susan Lowe,Mary Vivian, Mink Stole, and Rick Morrow. The deprave Divine is ultimately shot down by the national guard kinda like Godzilla and King Kong. This bizarre story also involves an erotic and disturbing scene with a 12 foot lobster, a church scene in a most unchurchy manner and  a nude Divine. This is a true camp classic in black and white in a not too black and white story line. find this one and hold on tight kids!!!!",1090195200,,1184,4.890547263681592
606069,4,6303223052,"Multiple Maniacs is on par with John Waters' Pink Flamingos when it comes to sleaziness and filth, though not quite as polished. The black-and-white cinematography gives the film a certain raw and crude quality, but that outrageous, hilarious Waters' dialogue, though in its infancy stages here, is already wielding an undeniable power over those of us who love trash cinema. Some scenes drag on a little longer than necessary, such as David and Bonnie lounging around in bed, or Cookie and Steve talking about riots but there are others, such as the opening in the circus tent, and the ""rosary job"" that more than make up for it. Be sure to look and listen for Divine and Cookie flubbing their lines, Divine's wig almost falling off as he is being violated by Lobstora, and Mink Stole trying not to laugh as a male pedestrian walks by when she and Divine are discussing the murder of Mr. David and Bonnie. All in all, I recommend watching this only AFTER you have seen Hairspray, Polyester, Female Trouble, Pink Flamingos, and Desperate Living, in THAT order. By that time you will have decided if you are a true John Waters fan or not.",1081296000,6,1137,4.69
606070,3,6303223052,"Yes, it is slow, but when it moves, it moves full force.  Waters has said that this film should have been a short subject, but I disagree.  There's too much here to abandon.  The basic stories are about a group of miscreants that hold a circus of atrocities, Divine's religious visions (filmed with much the same fervor that Kevin Smith did in Dogma), and a spurned lover's insane rampage.  Once again, Waters shows how ludicrous sex is, and how violence can be entertaining.  This is pre-Pink Flamingos, and Waters was stilling learning to edit and record sound.  He also was borrowing music without bothering about copyrights.  (Even this tape leaves in music that I'm sure is scavenged without proper recompense) For more polished Waters, get Desperate Living or Female Trouble, but for Waters raw, Multiple Maniacs is worth the price.",1011916800,,838,4.942857142857143

606073,3,6303223052,"Multiple Maniacs is Waters' first ""talky"" and it seems that he was a little inexperienced at writing dialogue at this point. Some of the lines are just way too silly or practically imcomprehendable (even for him  !). While the acting has always been intentionally corny (in his early  films)it goes beyond that in this one. Divine doesn't even seem as  confident here either. It's predecesor, Mondo Trasho (1969) is miles above  this, even though it's mainly like a silent film (occasionally a line or  two is dubbed in)with a soundtrack, mainly of rock n'roll oldies, pre- rock  n'roll pop, and trashy Catholic religous recordings.  Maybe even  the larger downfall is the thin plot of Multiple Maniacs. Some scenes like  ""the rosary job"" (w/ the stations of the cross) go on a little  long and may be time wasters. The Lobstora attack just comes out of nowhere  is out of place. Maybe Waters was torn between Warhol's art world and  making true comic trash at this point. You still need to see it if you're a  fan.",964396800,6,1015,4.698863636363637
606074,5,6303223052,"This is one of John Waters' first productions.  Filmed in black and white it concerns Lady Divine and her ""Cavalcade of Perversions"", which is a front for a roberry ring.  David Lochary plays Divine's boyfriend and Mary Vivienne Pierce plays his mistress.  The lovable Edith Massey has her first appearance on film in this one as the meddling bar maid at ""Pete's Bar"".  Mink Stole plays Lady Divine's mistress and there is a most entertaining scene involving Mink giving Divine a ""rosary job"" in an actual church!  Other highlights include a Waters' style re-enactment of the stations of the cross, a scene involving Divine being raped by a giant lobster, and the final insane rampage of Lady Divine which results in a SWAT team assault on the demented one.

7841695,5,6303223052,"The iconic filmmaker John Waters told the capacity audience at the Charles Theatre that in 1969, he had to borrow money from his dad to make the trashy cult classic, Multiple Maniacs. It didn't go over that big with moviegoers when it was released in 1970, but it did somehow slide by the Maryland Censor Board.

 Waters then had a running feud over censorship with the Board and its then chairlady, the late Mary Avara. How this film, with its scenes of sickening depravity, serial murders and shocking blasphemy, got pass her could be the making of yet another flick.

 But, Multiple Maniacs, has always had its niche audience with comedy/horror lovers. In any event, the movie featuring the late Divine has been restored and is headed for national re-circulation, via Janus Films.

 Divine was played superbly by the actor Harris Glenn Milstead. He was a boyhood buddy of Waters. He died on March 7, 1986. Milstead was known not only as an actor but also as a singer and drag queen. Before launching his acting career, he had been a hairdresser in Baltimore. Hes buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery in Towson, Maryland.

  The movie was filmed mostly in and around the Baltimore area. Fells Point, a wee bit trashy itself in that bygone era, was in a lot of the shots. It brought in just over $25,000 at the box office. Some of the opening scenes, Waters said, were filmed in his back of his parents home in Baltimore County.

 At the showing on Monday, September 12th, there were some talented folks, like Pat Moran, Susan Lowe, Mink Stole, Vincent Peranio and George Figgs, in the audience. They had worked on the film in various capacities and were known as the Dreamland acting troupe.

 George Figgs took on the role of Jesus Christ - a high calling - under any circumstances. He was more than adequate. And, Mink Stole nailed it as the Religious Whore. While, Divine carried the flick in the demanding, hilarious role of Lady Divine.

 As for Peranio, he also designed the giant lobster, known as Lobstora, for the movie. They said it cost about $20 for the material. It looked real to me and thats the bottom line.

 Waters introduced each of actors present to warm rounds of applause. To learn more about the films restoration, check out the article in Variety dated, August 6, 2016, at: [...]

 Rotten Tomatoes, a movie review website, Walters reminded the audience, has given Multiple Maniacs, a hundred percent rating. It is his highest rated film. Who knew?

 The restored version will carry the tagline, Restored! Reviled! Revolting. It opened in early August of this year at one of the Waters fave hangouts, the Provincetown Film Festival.

 This is your final warning!

  What kind of reaction did Multiple Maniacs get on September 12th? Let me put it this way: It was a non-stop laughathon!

The lesbian scene in the church is hilarious, unless you're a Christian.  The most creative use of a rosary that I've ever heard of.  No kidding.

7841699,5,6303223052,"Well firstly, I will NOT attempt the usual plot description with THIS film, as THAT would be no easy undertaking, to say the least!  Now it isn't that this movie just doesn't have ANY plot.  No,quite the contrary in fact,.. . THIS insane &@#%!^& flick actualy seems to have SEVERAL different plots, . .. and a whole bunch of sub-plots inbetween!! Kind of in the same way an insane PERSON might have several diferent and distinct personalities, I supose! And while these manifold scenarios do kind of overlap ( barely anyway ) and feature the same characters, they actualy seem more like distinct and unrelated segments that have been compiled into this one movie, and very loosely conected to each other, instead of a single cohesive premis,.. giving the overal film a kinde of anthological quality ( which, it seems, it may as well have been intended as )!  Hell, at one point, near the end of the film, it even dispenses with ANY kind of storyline and goes COMPLETELY off the rail, . . becoming totaly insane and anarchic!!
To enhance the confusion, theres also something of a melding of genres!  Drama, porn, horror, biblical epic, art film, .. . this motion picture seems to feature elements of ALL of them, .. yet it's NONE of them ( though it's entirely humorous, .. however in a very warped fashion )!!  In short, a very, .. . dissordered movie, to say the least!
However, THIS is a John Waters film, .. . an EARLY John Waters film at that!  Not, minde you, that John ""Hairspray, Cry Baby, Serial Mom, Ceicel B. Demented"" Waters whom you see nowadays on TV talk shows, . . no, I mean that infamous deranged maveric visionary with that seedy, yet strangely exotic, troup of genuine social pariah types from WAY beyond the fringe, and yet unspoild by Hollywood and the mainstream media!  This is therefore NOT a motion picture that I recomend for ordinary conventional moviegoers ( NO!! For the love of God, and Hollywood, RETREAT!! STAY AWAY!!! Tis FORBIDEN unto YOU!!! ), .. however, I ABSOLUTELY DO recomend this motion picture to fans of EARLY John Waters ( ""Come on in ye sickos!! .. Have at it, by all means, and join the fun!!! ) For THAT rare and special breed of moviegoer does NOT come to a Waters movie admiring and demanding  cohesive plot structure!  No, what THEY value and treasure in a Waters work are outrageous situations and ideas, .. foul, caustic,and hysterical verbal dialogue, ..and outlandish characters like only HE can dream up!  And,sufice it to say, THOSE deviates will NOT be dissatisfied here!
Of course, being a vintage work, this film does lack that unique visual style that Waters later more lavishly budgeted films have ( made in black & white, with a $ 100 budget, and before people like Vince Peranio and Van Smith came into the Waters fold to contribute their creative talents ), .. but none the less, it's cripplingly low budget not withstanding, Waters distinctive brand of creativity and humor is definately here on very raw display ( and THATS something money can't buy anyway, right you sickos ? ), and it does feature some of his most twistedly imaginative concepts and funniest screenwriting!

To begin with, theres this certain 'Lady Divines Calvacade, .. . a kind of mobile menagerie of human exhibits. A ""freakshow"" of sorts ( remember those ? ).  However, hold up gramps, cause THIS is the Calvacade of PERVERSION!!  And the human anomolies on dissplay HERE are, in the words of the hysterical master of ceramonies, ""Asorted f@&s, $!uT$, and d! k$#!!!  Real actual FILTH who've been carefuly screened in order to bring YOU the most flagrant violation of natural law known to man!!!"", .. and which ""comit acts which would make any decent person recoil in disgust!!!"" .. . more specificaly, porn models, sado masochists, underwear fetishists, dopers, kissing ""qu##r$$"", a girl ecstaticaly whiffing and caresing a well-used bicycle seat, and a ""puke eater"" who spews into a bucket and ""laps it back up for you!!  He loves it!!"", . .. right, instead of the more traditional  dwarves, siamese twins, dog-faced boy, human pincushion and so forth, . . you get the picture ?  ""What you will see in THIS tent will make you literaly SICK!!!""  asures said barker.  And where paying spectators marvel, recoil, gag, sneer, scowel, retch, and utter remarks such as ..""No decent person would ever act like that!!"" ..""DECENT!!!  HA!!  SHE doesn't even KNOW the MEANING of the WORD decent !!!""
The tuor concludes with the shaken spectators being nabed, pistol whiped and robed, ..""Kindly hand over all wallets, jewelry, fur items, .. . and any narcotics you might be carying !""

Then this Calvacade scenario is seemingly ditched, and hardly even figuers in the remainder of the film ( getting back to that previously mentioned anthology aspect ), .. and is succeded by what I discern to be kind'a the MAIN premis from here onward, .. . a kind of story about infidelity and retribution, .. yet done Waters-style ( meaning twisted and skewerd ), and with Divine as the jilted wife from hell out for revenge, .. homicidal revenge,at that!!

""OOOOOOOOO, . .. That slimy little pig-$^#%@& and cheesy street walker girlfriend of his!!  Niether of them deserve an ounce more air running through their putrid little lungs!!  I hope they've had their fun, cause it'll be the LAST fun they'll ever have!!!""

This latter scenario leads to a hillariously inimical and caustic living room squable ... .

""I can only take so much from a common lesbian!!""

""Well, my dear, at least I'm not some bleahced blond hu$$@y who goes around $@r#wing unhired giggalos!!""

""Quiet!!  Your speaking to someone who is miles above YOUR element!!  I mean, where did you meet ?!!  Were you her gym instructer or something ?!!""

.. erupting into a frenzied brutal orgy of murder with a butcher-knife ( inspired by the then recently occured Sharon Tate murder and also kind'a prefiguering the future ""slasher"" movie trend ) complete with some canibalism for good measure, .. . and followed by a rapturous rave about the incomparible joys acrued from same .. .

""Ohhhhh you cant imagine the thrill it gives when the knife first plunges and the person resists a little!!!!  Ohhhhhh I LOVED doing it !!!!!""

Theres also this totaly perplexing ( to myself at least ) subplot which comes utterly out of nowhere, but seems to be a kind of parody of surealist cinema with religious overtones involving an Infant of Prague, .. . what apears to be a midget in a potentate costume????  This is the one part of this film which, I must admit, goes totaly right by me ( though it does have an admitedly dreamy quality ).  But, then again, I'm personaly unfamiliar with the catholic faith, which may be the reason that I just don't get it.  But anyway ... .

Of cours, one MUST have deviant sexuality, lurid and scandalous, in a Waters flick, particularly an early one.  Well, that prerequisite is well-fulfilld by such an escapade, of a pronouncedly sacriligeous character, ocuring in a church, and featuring such dialogue as .. .

 ""As I continued to pray, I'd picked up a strong sexual vibration from that woman behinde me , .. who was robing me of my prized thoughts and drawing me back into my everyday quest for self gratification!!"" ... ""She then kissed me as though Christ himself had orderd every move of her experienced tongue!!""

.. . and verging on pornographic! Involving sodomy with a crucifix, . . ""rosary job"" as it's called in the film ( some years before Linda Blair comited that transgresion in The Exorcist it should be noted )!

Then, there is what could be called the showstoper of the film,.. and posily the most outlandish thing that Mister Waters demented minde has ever given birth to! A truely fantastic, and even horrifying ( however absurd )scene in which Divine is attacked and carnaly ravished, on a living room sofa, by a fifteen foot broild lobster ( thats right, . . a lobster )which looks like it'd escaped from some trashy brade B monster flick from the 1950's, .. and not seeming to enjoy enjoy the experience judging from her anguished blood-curdling shreiks, .. . the monsterous entity grasping her breast with it's enormous pincer while mounting and humping her repeatedly!!  This incredible outrage being preceded by a lurid macabre monologue ( deliverd amid a surounding litter of murdered victims on the floor ) about delving utterly and irretreivably into ones ""own depravity"" and attaining a state of total monsterdome ""Your a monster now!!!  And only a monster can realize the fulfilment I'm capable of !!!"" , .. with absurd, yet very imagistic Godzilla references ""You can wipe out entire shoping malls with one stomp of your foot!!! And destroy entire cities with one blast of your fiery breath!!!"" ( Divine really should've taken an Oscar for this scene. His talent as an actor is clearly evident here!).
For additional sexual, gross-out shock-gag value, theres even a Divine nude scene ( ""Get me my loungewear honey!"" ) !!

All the stars of the old Waters realm are here.  Besides Divine, theres David Lochary as both the hysterical and previously well-quoted Barker during the Calvacade segment and as Divines cheating and anxiety-ridden boyfriend ( something of a duo-role of sorts, .. though I think it's suposed to be the same character ?  The name is the same.)... . ""Ohhhhh god!!  You cant imagine what it's like!!  Every moment she's alive she's getting worse and worse!!  I'm afraid she'd kill us both on the spot if she caught us together!!""

Mary Vivian Pearce as his mistress. Sort of a Waters-warped version ( or rather per-version ) of the steriotypical ditzy blonde miss homewrecker .. . ""Ohh Bonnie, have you ever killd anyone before ?!"" .. ""Well no I havent.  But it would be something new !""

Edith Massey as a busybody bartender who informs Divine of the affair ( thus sealing the couples mortal doom in the proces ) . ..
""I just thought you'd like to know that your old mans over here with another broad!""

Mink Stole as a saphic seductress, with a blasphemy fetish, who exclusively haunts churches .. . ""I'm heaty most places. Like they heard about me over at St. Anthony's, so they always send a nun out to spy on me.  But, ya know what? .. I got a nun once, . . and let me tell you that it was JUST  what she needed !""

Coockie Meuller as Divines teenaged, doper, whore, and practicaly nudist daughter ( ""Divine saw to THAT from the day she was born!"" ) who's the frequent subject of her squabbles with Lochary .. . ""He's been using you to throw up in my face!  He sayes I'm f@#%!^ you up!""
 . . ""Well then I'm glad you did, that fart!!  I couldn't be happier!!""

Even the old Eggman, Pual Swift, from Pink Flamingos putes in a role here as one of Coockies tricks who'm she casualy introduces to her mother while in bed naked together .. . ""Oh hi mom.  I'd like you to meet Steve.  Steve, this is mom!"" .. ""Hi there!""

And, last but by no means least, in it's sole movie role ( to date ), .. the immortal Lobstora as it'self ?!!",1279929600,2,10989,4.686100989068193

A lot of freaks think this one is Waters' best.  It brings out the unlimited talent of Divine, Mink Stole, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pierce, and  introduces us to the deliciously ugly Edith Massey!

When these clowns spout out all the totally absurd lines that were stillborn in the Pope of Trash- John Waters' fertile imagination, no jaw is left shut, and no lunch is left unlaunched!  John's Catholic upbringing is left not to the imagination when you see the infamous ""Rosary Job"" scene, replete with endless dialogue about the Stations of the Cross!  To complete the blasphemy, at the end of the ""Blessed Sexual Encounter,"" John shoots a scene of a heroin junkie ""shooting up"" on the churchs' alter!

As the twisted plot evolves, Divine goes crazy after SHe gets raped by 9 foot Lobstora, then SHe does the ultimate blasphemy:  using a sledgehammer to bash out all the windows of a 1957 Plymouth Belvedere!  Oh, where is ""Christine"" when you need her?:)

My favorite scene is after Divine gets raped by that transvestite on the street!  The look on HIr face, the JOY in HIr eyes, and that hideous SMILE on HIr proves that SHe really GOT OFF on it!
