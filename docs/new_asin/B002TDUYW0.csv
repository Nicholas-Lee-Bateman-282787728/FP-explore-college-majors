We purchased this DVD along with several other products directly from The HomeScholar website because our son is approaching 7th grade.  He will be completing some high school level classes this fall so we want to be sure and capture all of those credits earned for his high school transcript.  After watching this, we feel better prepared for what is necessary to successfully homeschool through high school with college in mind.",1465948800,,535,4.98876404494382

What parent hasn't questioned their ability to homeschool through highschool and wondered how doing so would impact their child's ability to get into and succeed in college?

Preparing to Homeschool Highschool takes the fear factor out of the equation! Nearly 4 hours and 18 pages of notes later, this DVD delivered exceptional information, encouragement, and empowerment for tackling those high school years!

Lee warmly invites you to grab a cup of coffee or tea as you sit down with her DVD, but I want to enthusiastically add a plea that you also grab a pen and notepad because this presentation is so chock full of information that you'll want to take copious notes from the moment you click ""play"".

Lee Binz, a.k.a The HomeScholar, skillfully leads you to tackle and release the fears of homeschooling, gear up and prepare with strategies of success, invest in your weaknesses, learn to choose curriculum wisely, and walks you step-by-step through the stages of planning, understanding the typical requirements of each subject, the do's and don't of record keeping and giving grades, the basics of transcripts and determining credits, and helps you make sense of those scary highschool and college tests (PSAT-NMSQT, PSAT, SAT, ACT, CLEP, AP).

It is an amazing amount of information, presented in a manner that is easy to understand, and leaves you confident that you can do absolutely do this!

As the saying goes ""Failing to plan, is planning to fail!"". Don't let those highschool years find you clueless and unprepared. This outstanding DVD is a great asset for any homeschool parent who is ready to meet the challenge and embrace the privilege of homeschooling through highschool!",1289952000,7,1933,4.950617283950617
