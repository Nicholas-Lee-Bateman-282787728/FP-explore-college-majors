7905834,5,B000009WCA,"I'm on Jose's list of rods researchers so I'm more qualified to speak about rods than ""Dr."" Christopher Coleman will ever be.  You can't even communicate with this so-called ""Dr."" to offer a refutation.  He erroneously compares Jose with P.T. Barnum without realizing that Jose offers something solid while P.T. Barnum offered hooey to the gullible.  Rods exist regardless of whether Jose discovered them or not.  They were bound to be discovered.  Mr Coleman is correct in only one respect and that is that rods are, indeed, insects.  But of an unknown species and its their high speed that has kept them from being discovered prior to Jose's accidental discovery.  The advent of the camcorder made this possible as now everyone could record rods without knowing it.  Rods are NOT the result of camera tricks, electronics, shutter speeds, etc.  They exist independent of anything.

I do agree that at the beginning and possibly visible in the video that Jose may have gone overboard in his decription of rods, etc.  But he was just reacting to the genesis of a new discovery in which everything is thrown on the table and one by one it is whittled to a reality.  Many videos not taken by Jose show that the reality of rods cannot be questioned.  The test of the Swedish tank is one of the better videos showing a rod traveling unbelieveably fast.

To cut to the chase, I also started taping rods off transmission TV and I have some excellent high-altitude, VERY BIG rods.  I have a variety of footage showing rods in many activities such as scaring an eagle, a leopard.  And keep in mind the so called Albany rod which was thought to be a missile!  Tell me THAT was the result of an image too close to the camcorder since the footage was shot by a professional cameraman, using a very expensive professional camera, and the rod was way up there where airplanes fly.

No sir, do not pay attention to ""Dr."" Coleman and buy the tape and see it with an open mind, you'll come away a believer.  Unless, like ""Dr."" Coleman you have a closed mind and are not open to new possibilities.  Science makes new discoveries constantly and when they can handle it, results follow.  As has happened many times, this time it wasn't a scientist but it was an important discovery nevertheless.",1171324800,,2275,4.651629072681704
7905835,1,B000009WCA,"Este video trata de hacer creer a las personas crdulas que lo que Jos Escamilla filma en video son seres extraordinarios, cuando en realidad, los famosos ""rods"" son simplemente el efecto de insectos voladores que dejan un trazo borroso frente al lente de una cmara que est tomando la escena a una velocidad lo suficientemente lenta como para no congelar el vuelo del insecto.

Hay una investigacin hecha por Roger Harris que puedes buscar en Internet en ingls o en espaol (en mi sitio web sobrenatural.net tengo la versin traducida al castellano). Simplemente busca la palabra ""Bugrods"" y toma una buena decisin respecto a la compra de este video: ignralo.",1092787200,,656,4.963636363636364
7905836,1,B000009WCA,"Jose Escamilla knows that P.T. Barnum was right, and there's a sucker born every minute.  In spite of the claims made by Mr. Escamilla in this disgraceful video, rods are not UFOs or biological creatures capable of moving so fast that we can't see them.  They have no conspiracy to spy on our Space Shuttle launches, and they are not covertly watching our every move.  They don't come from outer space, they are not interdimensional (any more than any of us are, that is), nor can they move through solid objects.
But they do indeed exist, and the US government certainly knows about them, even having taken drastic steps to kill them mercilessly when they have endangered the public health.  Rods are flying insects, pure and simple.  When insects are photographed at certain exposure settings, be it on video or with still photography, they create exactly the patterns that Escamilla would have us believe are extraterrestrial.  His ""experts"" are simply no more credible than the ""experts"" that pronounced the so-called Alien Autopsy video unquestionably real--funny how even the Fox Network finally fessed up to that one when they'd originally broadcast it as the truth.  If you don't believe me, do a websearch for ""bugrods"" where there is an excellent expose.  Better, try an experiment yourself: capture some large flying insects, release them and photograph them at various shutter speeds--you WILL end up with rods.  Exercise your gray matter, don't be gullible, and pass this one by.",1024790400,,1492,5.032520325203252

7905838,4,B000009WCA,"Jose Escamilla is the best known person when it comes to Rods.  His documentary, ""Rods-Mysterious Objects Among"" is a great video to watch and own.  Hopefully, as the only video on rods, you will be more educated on them after watching this film!",1018742400,,246,4.6976744186046515
