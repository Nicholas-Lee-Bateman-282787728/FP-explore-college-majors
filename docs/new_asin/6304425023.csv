7871433,2,6304425023,"This video trilogy is a set of live theatrical performances taped up in Canada of three of Shakespeare's more familiar works: ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" ""As You Like It,"" and ""Romeo & Juliet.""  Unfortunately, they are not the most LIVELY theatrical performances I have encountered.
The productions are sound, and obviously ably directed.  But that doesn't fully counteract the fact that, especially for two of Shakespeare's sillier comedies, they just aren't played very funny.  This particular production company obviously went for a deep artistic production rather than audience-friendly entertainment.  Which is too bad, for I like all three plays when they are done well and captivating.
These are NOT the videos to buy if you're hoping to foster a love for Shakespeare in new-comer junior high students, which is what I was hoping for when I bought them.",1051833600,5,859,5.158273381294964
