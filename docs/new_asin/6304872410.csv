7878421,5,6304872410,"My daughter is 30 and wants all these movies she saw as a child so she can have for her children.  I was a music teacher and used to take 2 or 3 classes at a time to give teachers a break during ""kids are crazy season"". and they loved this move no matter how many times they saw it.  The songs were contagious and it was 27 min., the perfect film :)",1379116800,,349,3.767123287671233
7878422,2,6304872410,"I got this movie for my son and also because my wife is a 2nd grade teacher. I thought it would be good for the kids when the school has movie days, before the holidays/vacation. This movie was a huge disappointment. I thought it would be along the lines of ""The White Seal"" or ""Riki-tiki"", boy was I wrong. It was like someone got up one day while still in their under-wear and wrote something down because they had to meet some deadline. One would do better just recording old ""Tom & Jerry"" episodes from regular television. We had to force ourselves to get through it and then I was appalled at how bad the ending actually was. No wonder I had never heard of this movie before.

Well, thanks for reading my review.",1127260800,2,717,4.350746268656716

7878424,5,6304872410,"I used to watch this and ""Rikki Tikki Tavi"", and ""The Last Unicorn"" all the time when I was little and I loved it. I've always been a big fan of cartoons, because cartoons is where I taught my self to draw, and I really like this cartoon because I liked the characters, and I always liked thoes three glamour cats..I used to draw them a lot.  This is just a good movie for kids.",977356800,8,378,4.04
