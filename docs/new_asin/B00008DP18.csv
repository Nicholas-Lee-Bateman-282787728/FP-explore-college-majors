1841528,4,B00008DP18,"Based on the subdued novel, which is a very good read, Return to Innocence tackles the issue of an alleged sexual abuse on a minor, with the unique spin of placing the man in the position of victim and the boy as aggressor. You really get a sense of the danger the man is in and you find yourself pulling for him during the trial. Richard Meese (the man) nails the sympathetic male role to perfection, while Andrew Martin (the boy) does a very convincing job at making you love and hate him at the same time. This film is not for everyone, but those of us who work amongst children as I do (teacher) will find this little film to be an educational tool in addition to its entertainment value. It is a well-crafted movie, and a true example of independent cinema at its best. .",1072828800,35,776,4.285714285714286
1841529,2,B00008DP18,"I am NOT a professional movie critic but I still can fine a bad movie.  The story line was good, not as good as the novel, but I have yet to see a movie that's better than the book.  I felt the actors were being carried through thier lines.  They felt hollow and unconvincing to me.  I felt that the relationship between Chris and Tommy should of been given more time on the film.  To be thrown in to thier relationship, without decent actors, created an empty void for me.  I also felt the Black & White aspect of the film degrated the film even further.  It looked cheap and homemade.  Though this topic is highly taboo in America today, it still should of been made to show how this type of ""LOVE"" truly begins and that all things aren't always as the seem  to be on the surface.  Thus breaking the darkness that surrounds people who love those how turly care about them.  Regardless of gender, skin, or age difference.",1072396800,4,922,4.333333333333333

But since I almost never give movies an ""A"" grade, I must say destructively that the film could have been polished up a bit. I noticed a few mistakes but I guess that is expected from a young director. I do however recommend the movie to any one interested in court cases.",1068940800,16,438,4.1647058823529415
1841531,2,B00008DP18,"I've seen movie students' first year projects that were more professionally made and acted that this, but let's ignore the poor camera work, the feeble ""atmospheric"" lighting (read ""poorly lit""), and move right onto the content.
* Spoiler alert!!!*
The movie purports to be ""a riveting look at the processes and agendas involved in the prosecution of a child sex abuse case"" But it's nothing of the sort. I could have written more plausible and scientifically supportable material than this film depicts in an afternoon, and I'm no expert....
This film is crass and superficial and I'm deeply suspicious of its raison d'etre.
Anyone familiar with the story surrounding Victor Salva's Clownhouse will understand that all is not always as it seems.
If it's on the level, then this film is a cheap, poorly made and sensationalistic attempt to capitalise on the current child sex abuse hysteria, with voyeuristic and needlessly graphic and scandalistic dialogue.
The actors may as well be supported by strings, such is the ineptitude of their wooden performances, though all except the truly woeful judge, can be forgiven considering the embarrassingly poor script and dialogue.
On the plus side, the DVD was easy to take out of the DVD case...",1067299200,3,1240,5.083333333333333

That said, the film sometimes comes across as a third rate melodrama, some of the acting is not too good, especially in the first part of the film, and some of the plot points are not convincing.

1841534,4,B00008DP18,"The DVD/movie is about the fictional story of  Tommy Jackson, a physically, emotionally, and sexually abused 13-year-old boy; the story was actually adapted from a novel.  However, the movie feels real and is primarily about a sexual abuse case.  The film is moving right from the opening scene, where the FBI arrests the boy's mother for making pronographic videos of him and selling them on the internet, as he stands in a room with a camera, clad in only boxer shorts--a very haunting scene. The rest of the film focuses on his relationships with two therapists in his new home, a treatment center, called New Horizons.  However, the nature of Tommy's relationship with his counselor develops into a crossing of boundries that is exposed by the other therapist.  But Tommy although seemingly confused and hurt by the events, will defend and even strike back to preserve their relationship, ""keeping the secret.""  He pushes it all the way, resulting in a dramatic court case that examines the issue of sexual abuse from the angle of a professional on the subject, but with a twist, and who is defending his freedom and career.
  At first, I wondered why the director chose a black and white medium, but then it became clear.  This media added intensity to the film, or in the director's words, was used to make the film appear timeless, that is appropriate to any time period. The film is almost done documentary style with a voice over given by the lead character, played by Richard Meese, whose whole presence and voice are perfect for this role.  Tommy, played by Andrew Martin, gives a very gifted performance for his age, 14,  and due to the subject manner.  The only acting perhaps could be improved upon was near the opening where a group of kids fronm the center are standing around talking.  Their dialogue sounds as if they are merely line reading from a card, and doesn't sound natural.  Of course these weren't real actors but kids the director asked to be in the film that were playing near by at the time of filming.  Note this is not a violent or pronographic film and contains no nudity, sexual activites, etc. or even much profanity (it was unrated, just to clear all of this up but not because it contained all of these things) Although eventually by some, this film  may be pigeon- holed as a ""gay interest"" film, but that would be misleading even inspite of the one apparently gay character protrayed  (though under very negative circumstances this characte is, but yet only a character) in the film and the subject material of sexual abuse and relations between adults and minors. Both of the therapists Tommy are involved with are married men with children.  (Not exactly the dirty old man molesting young boy theme here.)  Rather, the film as does the character looks to examine loving relationships between men and boys, in a truly caring way, not the NAMBLA way.
  Anyhow, I would especially recommend this film to those who work with abused children and mental health/health care professionals.  Having worked in this area, I thought this film was a good protrayal of a kid with these issues and behavior.  Really, this film could be enjoyed by many people and therapeutic even to a mature audience, or those dealing with these issues.  The film is very emotional and uplifting and provides some closure and resolution, all good elements in a film and therapy.  The only thing is the film did focus more on the adults in the situation, rather than Tommy, but that's the context of the story. It does not dwell on or dive into great detail of Tommy's previous or even current experience of ""abuse"" but nevertheless, the viewer sees Tommy's emotional resolutions in the course of the film.  Go out of your way to see this film and you may have to as it isn't in theatres, on tv, or available everywhere--but worth watching.",1055808000,114,3849,4.741741741741742
1841535,2,B00008DP18,"The good thing about this movie is the point it's making.
And some of the cinematography was nice.
The difficult subject matter at hand is in itself, well treated, but deserves a better herald than this movie.
Its ultracheap production values and wooden performances, sometimes laughable when really they should be emotional moments, make this in a way a lamentable effort.

I was particularly impressed with the chilling portrayal of how small-minded and arrogant the legal system can be in trying to preserve the innocence of our youth. The system stinks; Costanzo's movie does not. It's a powerful and provocative achievement from a first-time filmmaker of enormous promise.

The acting is poor, and the script stilted and full of stereotypes. (The lone gay character, for example, is a mincingly effeminate pedophile, predictably the only true pedophile in the film.) I think this flick wanted to be film noire circa about 1952 - an episode of Perry Mason, perhaps. But even Ellery Queen would have flinched at an unbelievable script like this in which a trained psychologist makes just about every error one can make in dealing with a minor patient.

1841570,5,B00008DP18,"The production of this movie is superb in being instructive:  This is a true-to-life narrative how a boy lost his innocence because his own Mother sold his sex even to the extent of using him in Pornographic movies starting at the age of 7 years old to support her addictions to illegal substances?!  Second, this is a true-to-life narrative of the professional, hazardous minefield, a Counselor has
to proceed through to help any young boy to recover from the multiple consequences of such abuse.  the hazardous minefield includes the reality of what one little accusation can do to a man's career, family and life.  A child psychologist faces  very graphic accusations of child sexual abuse from the 13 year old boy he as helped.  Then, in a serious courtroom drama, the child psychologist must defend himself until the 13 year old boy confesses his innocence and the real perpetrator is someone else.  Although the child psychologist is absolved and declared innocent by the Court in the public, the damage is done and his career in the field of counseling and recovery for minors who have been the victims of child sexual abuse.  This DVD movie is a superb
example that double jeopardy is a door which swings both ways - although innocence is re-affirmed, some unjust damages are beyond repair.  A good representation of a pyric victory even to the extent all have lost and no winner exists.",1401148800,2,1395,4.8277310924369745

1841576,5,B00008DP18,"It concerns complexities. And it does so with stark honesty and delves into an issue that seems so simple on the outside looking in. The reason of betrayal was the boy's been walked away from after begging not to have another back turned, another door closed, and the terrible abuse of silence and alone.

Integrity is caught in a web and a web says this must always be looked at as in child molestation, which taints even the kindness of a word, brilliantly dissected by the lawyer uncomfortable as he may be with it.

The ending, the resolution, that all important character witness, the warmth of it, the showing there have been no strings to cut, only a deepest thank you for seeing a former street boy as a person, and Christmas, and come back, putting his own reputation on the line for a friend.

Though I doubt anyone can get a Phd. in writing the topic is not always as it seems, or be such an important part of New Horizons, it says much of how lonely this world, especially for children, and a kind man with an overflowing heart, can maintain dignity and every day of his life, give a place of safety to children with such dark, painful backgrounds.

A somber, well-thought out film, it never loses its footing.

Any accusation of underage sex is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, even as they vary state to state. This does take into account your 18 year old son sleeping with his 17 year old girl friend. Parent's retribution is swift. When we come to such minor/adult sex activity with anyone, it is prosecuted. But hold onto your hats,God help you if you have been accused of a same sex affair between and adult and a minor. All hell will be rained down onto you. No consideration is given to vindicating testimony or evidence. This super hot button issue drowns out any semblance of a coherent pursuit of the facts. Once 'branded', as the main character in this film, nothing can acquit him/her/you. No how, no way. A life is ruined despite any retraction of the accusation.

Then, as a country, we wonder why there are not more foster parents willing to step up and foster kids. No one is now willing to take the risk of pissing off a foster child and be accused of nefarious actions. It is a nightmare of our own creation.

1841610,4,B00008DP18,"Return to Innocence is a film produced and directed entirely from the OC (Orange County) with a low budget, in black and white, in 2001, but was released recently (May 2007.). It's director Rocky Costanzo tries to portray one of those controversial and taboo topics, child molestation and sexual abuse.

The main two characters, Dr. Glen Erskine, is a PH.D. in clinical psychology, specializing in the area of man and boy relationships, and pedophiles. He is an expert, and published extensively, about whether a man can have a loving and caring relationship with a boy, raising eyebrows and causing him to be suspicious of pedophile. Dr. Erskine is a member of the New Horizons, a home that houses troubled teens awarded to them by the court.

Tommy, (Andrew Martin), is a troubled teen who has been abused since early life (his mother.) He has consensual sex with one of Dr. Erskin counselor (Tommy's counselor.) After learning of this, Dr. Erskin confronts the counselor and he dies of a suicidal attempt. Tommy becomes very upset, and in his anger he accuses Dr. Erskin of molesting him. Because of circumstantial events between Dr. Erskin and Tommy as part of the treatment, he looks real bad in the eyes of the law.

There is a trial of Dr. Erskin and he is defended by a long time friend (since he is a boy) Jim (Steve De Forest). Jim proves that his friend Glen is not guilty. At the end, Tommy breaks down and admits that he had fabricated the whole thing.

Return to Innocence is a term used in which even if someone is absolved from a child molestation crime, that person still labeled and branded for the rest of their life, meaning can not return to innocence. Dr. Esrkin return to his practice at New Horizons (he was suspended during the trial.) Tommy is placed in a loving foster home.

Return to Innocence is a good drama, the actors are admirable and realistic in their acting. The issues are troubled and controversial, but a sadness of reality, of sick and disturbing minds. It is a low budget movie with no big movie fanfare. There is some special features of a reunion of all the main characters in May 2007.",1202601600,32,2130,4.639257294429708

Despite the boy in the bed on the DVD box cover, the film is not exploitative or sensational. It deals with the exlposive subject with care and understanding, not only for the characters, whose story it tells, but the young actors asked to portray the victim(s). It's a bit talky at times, almost more court-room drama than anything else, but a compelling drama overall. This is the kind low-budget movie and raw, provacative story that rarely makes it to theaters, so it is pretty courageous for the writer, producer, director to have made the movie in the first place, and then to have released it (many years after it was finished) on DVD.

1841615,2,B00008DP18,"As the previous reviewers have stated, this is indeed a powerful film. However, its the premise and some (certainly not all) of the performances which make it so. The film itself leaves much to be desired. The thankfully original and wholly worthy premise is that a 13 year-old boy who was once sexually exploited by his own mother happens to be in love with an older married man who is now his counselor. There is a mutual and highly plausible love between the boy and the man. But when its discovered that the man has had sex with the boy, the man, of course, must pay. His job, his career, his reputation, his life with the wife he loves (whos expecting a child), will all be lost when the news is made public. When the man dies from wounds sustained in an accident, the boy avenges the mans accuser by claiming the accuser  not the man he loved  molested the boy. The remainder of the film is devoted to the accusers trial  and, in a nice twist, the accusers guarding of the boys secret from the eyes of the law, which could certainly never understand. Most of the performances in the film seem completely amateurish with the notable exception of the boy, Tommy, played with a sad, noble innocence by Andrew Martin (who has only two gratuitous underwear shots and conveys a very convincing need to be loved, really loved, throughout). The accuser, his lawyer and the trial judge also play their parts very effectively. The films direction, brave and welcome as it may be to present a story of this magnitude, seems far more hackneyed. The choice of black and white video filming may seem ultra cheap (the movie was never transferred to film), but it lends the atmosphere a somewhat appropriate air of exploitation documentary like youd expect to see on late-night cable TV. But the incessant talking (everybody has A LOT to say in this film) and the annoying two takes that director Rocky Costanzo uses in almost every one of the far too long dialog scenes are unnecessary AND unartful (one speaker bathed by white, another speaker bathed in black, back and forth, back and forth, back and forthyou get the point). Id recommend this film to any of the witch hunters out for so-called child molesters who don't understand the potential of love that a boy can have for a man and the love that a man can have for a boy. But it doesnt matter. The only people who will see this film  or care about its message  are the people who already agree with its premise.

There were only a few times I found scenes to be a little on the long side - like when the doctor is trying to get the boys' counselor to admit what he did (I won't spoil it here) but I thought the doctor was great and I was rooting for him all the way to the end.

7982271,4,B00008DP18,"The theme of the movie covers actual sexual abuse of children, as well as false accusations of sexual abuse of children. Along with this is the reactions of others to someone being accused, weather or not they are guilty. The title ""Return to Innocence"" refers to both the efforts to return a child to innocence after he has been abused and also to those falsely accused of abusing a child trying to return to a normal life. Neither can be fully accomplished. Along with the subjects of children being abused and of children making false accusations of abuse the movie also brings up the subject of children initiating sexual contact with an adult and the idea that sexual contact between a child and an adult may not always harmful to the child.

In one or two scenes the acting is little stiff, but for the most part the acting is okay. The special features are interesting but not outstanding. The commentary sound track by the director and leading actor was better than any of the special features. One of the special features and the commentary track bring up the question of why the film is in Black & White. I was hoping for some philosophical idea along the line that it was symbolic of the fact that not every situation in life can be seen as black or white, or at least that it was due to the dark subject matter, but the director said that he has always seen the movie as Black & White so I guess that it is just the director who sees everything as black or white.

Some criticism of the movie has been made concern the graphic description of the sexual abuse, however if you have ever sat on a jury for a sexual abuse trail you have heard the same descriptions. Profanity is never used in discussing the sexual abuse, and the details never go beyond what would be required for legal prosecution. Profanity is used at least once in the movie, maybe even two or three times, but never is the profanity directly related to sexual abuse.

One scene which has been specially criticized is the skinny dipping scene. However Joseph Ragusa (who played Peter) is not nude in the skinny dipping scene, he only says he is. The boys he is skinny dipping with are never seen, and I am sure no other child actors were actually there. In the next scene where he is out of the pool and looses his towel it is obvious that he is wearing a swimsuit, or something similar, which blinds in with his skin tone. This is a common cinematic tactic in filming such scenes. I will attach a video capture which shows this clothing. There is in fact no nudity at all in this movie. Tommy (Andrew Martin) is seen in his underwear in three scenes and with the exception of the aforementioned skinny dipping scene everybody else is fully clothed throughout the movie.

As for criticism of the idea that sexual contact between a child and an adult may not always harmful to the child. First of all, the expression if ideas, including this one, is covered by the first amendment therefore Dr. Erskine has the right to express this idea. Secondly, the Doctor is the only person in the movie who does openly support this idea and that is used against him in a court of law, which is also legal.

Overall I liked the movie. I would have preferred that it was shot in color, and if the budget was larger they could have reshot a scene or two where the acting could have been better. Speaking of scenes which could have been better, in the commentary track references are made to some deleted scenes, but none are included on the DVD.

P.S.  I have tried twice to upload the video capture of Joseph Ragusa I mentioned above but for some reason it is not appearing with the review. Sorry about that, but take my word for it, he was not nude.",1429920000,2,3714,4.436950146627566
