7973034,5,B00006SFKR,"Out of all the women, the character Traci played, was the real rebel in the movie. She stood her ground until the end. The others killed and decided to get all self-righteous the end of the movie. It's a campy horror film that is not to be taken seriously.",1159660800,3,256,4.244897959183674
7973035,4,B00006SFKR,"I watched this on TV out of boredom, expected to channel-flip it off quickly... but found myself laughing... it is a 'black comedy'.  In my opinion, comedy is hard to do, I've seen many fall flat even with tried-and-true stars and writers, but this one worked for me.  (But maybe my sense of humor is a little more blacker than others.) True, dialogue is a bit hard to hear in some places and the ending could've been done a little bit better, but all in all, it was worth my time.",1155254400,3,481,4.274725274725275

7973037,3,B00006SFKR,"This movie is a 2002 film and it is starring Tracy Lords! I have to actually say that I thought this movie would have turned out horrible. But it actually had a entertaining quality about it. The DVD'S sound and picture quality was very good, I thought for a B movie. Basically the premise of the story a woman kills her husband by accident. He was actually a jerk so it wasn't like he was missed in the film. She actually didn't miss him after the brutal death in the film. ""Traci Lords"" which was a friend of the girls came by and noticed there was blood on the wall and helps her hide the body. From there Traci developes a lust to kill men and decides to bring together a Club. Which she states in her own words ""This is more exciting that the Girl Scouts!"" Which consist of 3 women that go on a spree of haunting men down who are desrespectful in anyway. Well, actually the other two women are not confortable with the situation. Traci who is the ring leader forces and some what orhestrates all of the murders. Soon she turns against her own friends with threats that if the don't they will end up the same way. The movie inspires alot of comic relief it has a lot of high points and some low points. Over all Traci's performance was good but her facial expressions and pristine gestures made you feel she was posing for the camera. Her lip movements made you think she was powting even when she was just conveying a simple point. The perverted mortician scene is the funniest of all the killings it was completely uproarious! The movie is a definite watcher at least one time then put it away for a while. I think Traci is a very exotic looking woman she reminds me alot of Jaime Pressly. There was one more down point about the film even though the characters and acting was Quirky. I think the director over did trying to convey how horrible her husband was before the accident. I mean he had a short time to convey his point but I feel it could have been done better. The husband seemed a bit too harsh I mean his character was almost cartoonish and unrealistic to some degree. Over all though this movie isn't bad it will make you laugh. It is kinda similiar to Very bad things"" but not as good. Christian Slater's character ""Boyd"" was way more philisopical and uproarious than Traci's character.
