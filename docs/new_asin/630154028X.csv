332954,5,630154028X,"Andrei Tarkovsky's THE MIRROR is a historical achievement in art and form. This is what great movies should be like: very personal without being overly sympathetic and corny. It was very hard for me to understand. It is  about a person who is reviewing events that have occurred in his life  before he dies, but the movie presents his experiences in a non-linear  fashion. Probably the best way to approach this movie is to put yourself in  the individual's shoes. We all think of past experiences, but not always  chronologically. Even if one may find this film hard to understand, there  are many beautiful moments in this film: the opening scene, the dream  sequence, the print shop, the stock footage of the balloon ascent, the bird  landing on the boy's head, the firing range, the fire, etc... This movie's  unpopularity in the United States is living proof that many true works of  cinematic art in this country largely go unnoticed. If I can direct at  least one person to the works of Andrei Tarkovsky then I feel my work as a  film buff is done.",952646400,26,1055,4.643243243243243
332955,5,630154028X,"If you are seeking a film that can demonstrate an image's capacity to exceed beyond powerful, this is just one of Tarkovsky's films that achieves this.  It may take some effort to stay with the film's patient and  meandering pace, but that's the revel of this picture.  If you have ever  wondered what it might feel like to visualize a dream while awake, MIRROR  is a film to watch.  Any of Tarkovsky's movies introduce you to a visual  experience and vocabulary that is wholly unique in its execution and  original in its expression.  There is a tremendous amount you can learn  from his films, especially if you want to be a filmmaker.  Technically,  they are a marvel.  His films are executed with such flawlessness you might  forget to question how they are done.  MIRROR is exceptional in that  Tarkovsky's explorations and meditations on issues of self, relationships,  mothers, women, time, love, memory, history, art and poetry are deceptively  straightforward.  Experience this movie.  There are new and exciting things  to discover in MIRROR as well as any of Tarkovsky's films.",937353600,13,1088,4.966480446927374
332956,4,630154028X,"Having some knowledge of Tarkovsky the man as well as Russian history may prove useful to penetrating this extraordinary, layered film. A man (never seen, but presumed to be the director) reviews his own life, as well as the  lives of other people integral in his life--chiefly his wife and mother  (played by the same female actor),  set against a Russian historical  backdrop from the early Stalin years to the early 70s.  Those seeking  exposure to Tarkovsky, but are turned off by his longer, more ponderous  works (think _Andrei Rublev_), should be pleased to find that this film  clocks in at about 100 minutes, and packed with images that are at once  breathtaking and startling.  Tarkovsky is sort of an anomaly to other  Russian filmmakers because his films seemed to deal less with pro-Soviet  propaganda and more with aesthetic composition, and _The Mirror_ is no  exception. Juxtaposing film speeds, b&w v. color photography, Tarkovsky  subtly suggests the importance of individual perception and individual  focus shaping the way we view key  events in our lives. This film also  suggests that this conflict of the self is also both cyclical and basically  universal.  The film may bring to mind the key works of Joyce, albeit in a  more compartmentalized version. And the images themselves are positively  magnificent! My personal favorites are the bird landing on the child's  head, and the collapsing wall amidst a rainstorm.  Not an easy film to  watch at all, but definitely worth the effort. Tarkovsky paved the way for  other filmmakers, notably Peter Greenaway and Theo Angelopoulous, who saw  film as more effective as portrait instead of narrative device.",913680000,8,1678,5.099630996309963

332987,5,630154028X,"Seldom does poetry make strict literal sense, nor does it intend to. Rather, through a combination of careful word choice and syllabic cadence, a poet can evoke emotions and convey a message just as powerful as any traditional narrative.

Andrei Tarkovsky is often referred to as a visual poet, and Mirror is a film that doesn't just exemplify this style, but sees it realized to its fullest potential. Tarkovsky's images and compositions are the words of this poem, and the manner in which these images are stitched together through the organic movements of his camera is its cadence.

The narrative content of the film essentially involves a narrator reflecting over his childhood, adolescence, and adult life, particularly focusing on his complex relationships with his mother, wife, and son. Instead of telling a linear story, Tarkovsky seamlessly blends the present with the past and dreams with reality. The film continuously and unpredictably pirouettes along the narrator's timeline, highlighting key moments and slowly revealing his current state of mind and outlook on life.

It would be impossible to overstate the visual prowess of this film. Tarkovsky is a true master of visual art, and there is an abundance of searing, unforgettable images in this film that will instantly burn themselves into your brain. The shot composition, lighting, and use of color is immaculate and the way the camera flows freely within the spaces on screen creates an ethereal, other-worldly quality. Given that the vast majority of the film is populated by memories of the narrator, this style works extremely well. The camera seems to act as the mind's eye of the narrator as he journeys through his recollections. At times it hovers over his mother, wife or son, at others it slowly turns away and lingers on the environment as the characters speak off-screen. We as the audience feel like we are directly inside his mind, exploring these memories with him.

And despite the lack of strict narrative structure, plenty of messages and themes bubble to the surface as the film progresses. Having only seen the film once at the time of writing this review, I'm definitely at a disadvantage as this is the kind of movie that needs to be seen many times to fully absorb its story and themes. From what I was able to gather on the first journey through, a big theme of the film is the cyclical nature of life and the ways in which past experiences and traumas impact the present.

In an interesting and decidedly brilliant casting decision, Tarkovsky uses the same actors to play multiple key parts in the film. The same young boy plays both the narrator as a child in his distant memories, and his son in his more recent adult memories. He also uses the same actress to play his mother in his childhood memories, and his wife in his adult memories. This choice emphasizes the similarities between these characters despite their separation in time. There's a great narrated monologue about midway through the film in which the narrator (and Tarkovsky) muse over the ""immortality"" of life: ""Everything's immortal... One table serves both granddad and grandchild... The future is being made right now."" These words conjure an image of a continuous thread of life that permeates beyond the individual and through the generations.

And further, as I mentioned previously, Tarkovsky seems to suggest these generations are also cyclical in nature, with individuals that mirror and reflect one another as the title of the film implies. As a boy, our narrator struggles in the absence of his father who is fighting in WW II. He lives with his mother, grandmother, and sister in a remote wooden cottage after fleeing Moscow which had been bombed. Our narrator's mother is not much comfort to him and seems detached, even unhinged as much of the imagery suggests. A telling scene shows the division between mother and son, as the narrator attempts to unsuccessfully open a door and walks away, only to have the door swing open for us to reveal his mother behind it.

In the later memories, these themes recur. The settings have changed, but the characters (and again, the actors themselves) have remained the same. The narrator's son is also isolated and estranged from his distant and troubled mother. The narrator himself seems to fill the role of absent father like his father before, trying to push the boy to live with his mother or suggesting that they enroll him in a military academy. It's interesting as well that the narrator chose to marry a woman so similar to his own mother, as if he is still trying to become close to her even in adulthood.

The implication seems to be that the experiences (positive and negative) of the narrator in his childhood have impacted and shaped his adult life, as they do with us all. The film, then, is essentially the narrator's visualized realization of this as he journeys through his memories. Mirror is a deeply philosophical and visually stunning work that challenges and rewards the engaged viewer. If you love movies, don't miss this one.",1462147200,4,5069,4.927400468384075

332991,5,630154028X,"The Mirror is said to be a film that is not easy to understand. I say that it does not have to be understood to be enjoyed. This is a very beautiful, cerebral, and emotive film. As with other Tarkovksy films, there is both the natural and  the supernatural, but the natural is by far the dominant. The supernatural is like this overflowing of natural spirit (very much like in the STALKER film). The film is highly elemental: watery, fiery, windy, and earthy at different times, and the elements give off energy, and the world feels like this plastic material which one makes art out of. This is very different from the staged feeling of many films. In the Mirror, even the manmade structures feel natural, man feels natural as an expression of life. Even if you are aware it is a film, how can it feel artificial when it flows from a natural source? Aside from the vibe, the Mirror is a great film to look at. The lead actress is quite beautiful, though not in a conventional way, expressive and spirited. The camerawork is really great, gives a great sense of a taking place, love the movement in each scene. If you are the type of person that feels spiritual or meditative at times, or loves to just look at art or watch nature (or people), then the Mirror will be an excellent choice for you.",1444262400,2,1296,4.445378151260504
332992,5,630154028X,"This movie is a bit of a mystery like many other Tarkovsky's films. It is meditative and visually stunning. It is difficult to describe in words. The film is filled with lots of universal symbols, yet it is very Russian, I think. I admire Andrey Tarkovsky's works and happy to see that he had influenced so many contemporary film directors. I love all of his films made during his life in the Soviet Union and abroad. Still, among his films my most favorite one is ""Solaris"". There is some magic in ""Solaris"" that I cannot put in words. I can watch it countless times and always feel magnetized by it's atmosphere. ""The Mirror"" also has this magic pool. Again, it is a pure cinema, it is very experiential and hard to describe in words.",1429833600,2,736,4.5

333006,5,630154028X,"This is one of my favorite movies, and it is by one of my favorite directors.

Before watching the movie, it is important to know the format of the movie.  The movie is not telling a story in a chronological order.  The movie is a character study, studying the narrator through his relationship with his mother and his wife.  It fluctuates back and forth between past and present quite often, and this transition is made especially confusing by the same actress portraying both his wife and his mother.

So do not watch this movie expecting to see a story.  This movie is not a story.  This movie is a picture.  This movie paints a picture of the narrator, as well as of his wife and his mother through a series of memories.  Do not try to get a story line from this movie.  Just seek an understanding of the qualities (especially the flaws) of the characters.  Think of the movie as being an analog for how we access our memories when creating a picture of a person in our mind.  When we think of our mother, we do not follow a chronological path in the order in which memories come to the forefront of our mind.  So neither does Tarkovsky follow a chronological path in which the events in this movie are arranged.

When you stop trying to find a story, and just seek an understanding of the characters, that is when the remarkable beauty of this picture unfolds.

While Tarkovsky's movie Andrei Rublev is my favorite movie by him (and possibly my favorite movie by anyone), I think that the tranquil farmhouse scenes in this movie are my favorite scenes from any movie, especially the scene where the family barn burns down.",1420848000,7,1627,4.505119453924915
333007,5,630154028X,"Andrei Tarkovsky's THE MIRROR (1974) is his most personal and artistically daring film--and to me, ultimately his most moving.
A semi-autobiographical work, it interweaves poems, dramatic scenes, dreams and newsreels to evoke the inner symbolic world of the protagonist, his nostalgia for the past and his troubled relationships with his wife and mother in the present. At the same time it is a meditation on the nature of Russia, from the nation's role as mediator between the East and West to specific historical events such as the Stalinist purges of the mid-to-late 1930s and World War II. Indeed, few works of art say more about the Russian people with such economy.
The cinematography, by Georgii Rerberg, is so richly detailed that it frequently takes your breath away. Many of the shots are deliberately reminiscent of paintings by Breughel and Leonardo da Vinci. The soundtrack is equally beautiful, layered with natural sounds, electronic music, classical music (by composers such as Bach and Pergolesi) and poems (written and recited by the director's father Arsenii Tarkovsky, a noted Russian poet).
The film undoubtedly benefits from its superb cast, which includes many popular and highly respected Russian actors. The voice of the Narrator is played by Innokenty Smoktunovsky; Margarita Terekhova plays both the Mother and the Wife. Other actors make indelible impressions in smaller roles: Anatoly Solonitsyn (the Doctor), Oleg Yankovsky (the Father), Alla Demidova and Nikolai Grinko (the mother's colleagues at the printing factory). For those who speak Russian, it's a pleasure just to hear their finely tuned dialogue.
Although the film was widely criticized for being too difficult to follow, it was also praised by many Russian critics for capturing the spirit of an entire generation. It may not be to the taste of everyone, since it is constructed more like a poem than a conventional film narrative. However, for those who are willing to make the leap of faith, it is uniquely rewarding.
Kino on Video's new DVD looks absolutely stunning. Having seen the film a number of times in various less-than-ideal incarnations on video, I was impressed at the way the DVD captures the richness of the film's cinemtography. The film is above all a sensuous experience, so every extra bit of detail in the image and sound helps add to its overall emotional impact. Kino has used the same transfer for their new VHS edition, but the DVD is clearly preferable and it's the same price. It doesn't have any special features, unlike Kino's new release of Tarkovky's THE SACRIFICE, which includes a making-of documentary. However, it's hard to complain when the film itself and the video transfer are so satisfying. In summation, I can hardly recommend this particular title more highly.",1417910400,3,2795,5.172185430463577
333008,5,630154028X,"Tarkovsky's ""The Mirror""(1975) is more like a visual poem than a narrative story. Images jump forward and backward in time depicting thoughts and emotions of Alexei (Ignat Daniltsev) from childhood, and as an adult, from prewar to postwar. This is largely an autobiographical film that references back to Tarkovsky's childhood. Poetry written and spoken by Tarkovsky's father is intermingled with scenes. Mirrors are constantly being used. Sometimes mirrors are used like windows into the future. In one scene Alexei's mother, Maria (Margarita Terekhova), is looking into a mirror and sees an old woman (herself in the future). This scene then transitions into the old woman's present time. There are some instances like this in the film where one is reminded of scenes from Stanely Kubrick's film ""2001"" (1968) where one leaps forward in time or seems to be looking into the future. This film depicts the gaze as a reflection of the world of memories divorced from time, and so the mirror, the reflection of self, can be seen as a metaphor of the ephemeral, and as a window into memory and dreams.",1417910400,3,1098,5.005464480874317

333010,5,630154028X,"Mirror (1974) is central to the filmography of Andrey Tarkovsky. Not only is it the fourth of seven remarkable features, but it is the one which says the most about the man and which states the free-flowing meditative and associative tendencies of his mature style most clearly and, arguably, most successfully. The film takes pride of place in Tarkovskys marvelous book of reflections on cinema Sculpting in Time. In chapter 5 he deals with the various aspects of film making  the film image; time, rhythm and editing; scenario and shooting script; the films graphic realization; the film actor; music and noises  and illustrates his points by referring almost exclusively to Mirror. Furthermore, all the texts and paintings featured in the film  his fathers poems (read in the film by Arseny Tarkovsky himself), Leonardo's paintings and drawings, Pushkins 1836 letter to Pyotr Chaadayev  are all reproduced in the book. Clearly Mirror was very important for Tarkovsky and he was intensely proud of it. He says, I had made up my mind that in this film, for the first time, I would use the means of cinema to talk of all that was most precious to me, and to do so directly, without playing any tricks. Theres no doubt that he considered it his greatest achievement. He even quotes Vadim Yusov the cameraman who had turned down the chance to shoot the film: It is true that afterwards, when the film had been shot by Georgi Rerberg, he once admitted to me, I hate to have to say it, Andrey, but it is your best film. And indeed, who are we to disagree? For me it is not only his best film, but the best film ever made period.

As other reviews posted here show, my view is not shared by everyone and I want to use this space to state the case for Mirrors greatness as clearly as possible. For Tarkovskys critics it is the film which most fuels the standard accusations about his work being difficult, obscure, pretentious, esoteric, and impenetrable. I think its important to understand that these accusations come from people who do not (perhaps cannot) reach out for an emotional poetic understanding. Perhaps blinded by the prevailing tendency of most cinema (even that of most other great directors) to communicate in terms of self-contained stories which resolve themselves by the films closure, their response is purely intellectual rather than emotional. Tarkovskys films start from the point of view that life or reality can never be related in self-contained logical stories  the usual logic, that of linear sequentiality, is uncomfortably like the proof of a geometry theorem. As a method it is incomparably less fruitful artistically than the possibilities opened up by associative thinking, which allows for an affective as well as a rational response. Reality is best approached obliquely in a way that encourages (necessitates) the audience take an active role in the films process. He said: Through poetic connections feeling is heightened and the spectator is made more active. He becomes a participant in the process of discovering life, unsupported by ready-made deductions from the plot or ineluctable pointers by the author. In this way a film such as Mirror which seems to be so complex and impenetrable intellectually is actually very simple if approached emotionally and empathetically. As one Leningrad factory worker wrote in a letter to Tarkovsky: My reason for writing is Mirror, a film I cant even talk about because I am living it. This simplicity means that for the director anyone, even children, can watch this film and get something from it. People are born with an innate ability to appreciate art and if they have a spiritual or poetic propensity then intellectual acuity is certainly not a prerequisite for understanding his films  Anyone who wants can look at my films as into a mirror, in which he will see himself. This last point is the key to unlocking the mysteries of this marvelous film.

I have to admit to being flummoxed by Mirror when I first saw it as a teenager. Compared to the traditional linear narrative structures of films like Ivans Childhood (1962), Solaris (1972) and even the later meditative/associative films (Stalker [1979], Nostalghia [1983] and The Sacrifice [1986]) the film seemed to jump willfully all over the place in terms of both time and place. Characterization seemed muddled and the plethora of obscure arty references coupled with the poetry recitation on the soundtrack alienated me. Nevertheless, there were scenes of the most exquisite jaw-dropping beauty that drew me back repeatedly to attempt an understanding. I have now seen the film countless times and can say that while it still triumphantly defies a complete understanding (it follows Goethe's dictum: ""The less accessible a work is to the intellect, the greater it is""), there is a clear narrative shape to the film rendered with impeccable poetic logic. The story of the film can be summarized and I recommend reading the analysis in Johnson and Petries outstanding book, The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual Fugue. They accurately summarize the film and correct the great many mistakes made by confused critics and writers in various other publications. For me emotion triumphs over intellect here and I won't attempt to parrot their work. Instead I will first outline the basic narrative framework of the film and place the key scenes within it. I hope this will make the film a little less intimidating to watch for the uninitiated. Then I will attempt a brief analysis of my own.

In essence Mirror is Tarkovskys autobiography as narrated by the subject as an adult (named 'Alexei' and voiced by Innokenty Smoktunovsky) who stays off-screen throughout. The film is set in Russia and spans three time periods  1935-39 (the scary time of Stalin's purges), 1941-45 (the Great Patriotic War), and 1974 (the present day). In the present Alexei is living in an urban apartment. He has a series of bitter conversations with his ex-wife Natalya (Margarita Terekhova) mainly about the welfare of their son Ignat (Ignat Daniltsev). Key events at this time are the film's prologue which has Ignat watching a man being cured of his stammer on TV, a family gathering of Spanish migrs, and a ghost scene where a mysterious old lady makes Ignat read Pushkin. In the earliest period (1935-39) we see Alexei as an infant living in the country with his mother Masha (also played by Margarita Terekhova). Here we have the encounter between the mother and a doctor (Anatoly Solonitsyn) who has lost his way, the burning barn, the presence and absence (mostly the absence) of Alexei's father (Oleg Yankovsky), and a long scene in a printing house where the mother works. In the period 1941-45 we see the teenaged Alexei also played by Ignat Daniltsev. Margarita Terekhova is still the mother. The main events of this period are the recalling of Alexei's first love (a girl with red hair and chapped lips) walking in the snow, the firing range sequence where a wounded war veteran is teased by his pupils (Alexei among them), and the long visit to a rich doctor's wife (Larissa Tarkovskaya  the director's second wife) in which the mother sells her ear-rings and is prevailed upon to decapitate a chicken. All three periods merge as one in the film's concluding epilogue which comes to center on the mother in her dotage (Maria Tarkovskaya  Tarkovsky's own mother) who we have glimpsed throughout the film and here ends up surrounded by her children/grandchildren playing outside the family dacha.

As an anchor to these three time periods and their events which are cut up and related a-chronologically with only the logic of dream and memory to connect them, Tarkovsky deploys quite astounding real newsreel footage arranged in chronological order so that we always know where we are. The eight sequences are as follows  the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), the Soviet army launching hot air balloons (1930s  year unspecified), Moscow May Day parade (1939), the Soviet army crossing Lake Sivash (1943), the liberation of Prague (1945), bomb explosions in Berlin and Hitler's charred remains (1945), the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima (1945), and finally huge crowds in China waving their Red Books and their portraits of Chairman Mao followed by Soviet troops constraining Chinese demonstrators on Damansk Island (1959). These sequences are put into historical context by the important scene of Ignat reading Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev  a vital document in the Westerner-Slavophile debate that dominated the Russian intelligentsia in the 19th century. Chaadayev was a Westerner who believed Russia should develop a political system along the lines of those of Europe. Pushkin's position was that Russia should be proud of her own heritage and traditions and should follow her own way even though she is eternally squeezed between two dominating cultures  Europe to the west and the Tartars/Mongols/Chinese to the east. Significantly perhaps Ignat starts to read Rousseau's view on the merits of scientific vs artistic ways of understanding existence  a concern central to the films that surround Mirror (Solaris and Stalker). Ignat is cut off by the old woman and forced to read Pushkin as if to say Mirror is about something even more important than that for Tarkovsky. The general effect of all this is to extend the film beyond mere personal autobiography towards a history of Russia. Shot with a poetic visual palette that shifts from color to b/w through sepia and beyond, the film consists of a series of memories and dreams which merge together freely and skip around these three time periods with the iconic newsreel footage without any apparent logic. General themes are meditated upon and the audience is invited to freely associate with the material in their own chosen way. We are asked to participate ""in the process of discovering life"" as Tarkovsky would have it in a history of Russia told in personal terms through the memories, dreams and poetry of one man and his family.

So far, so self-indulgent one might say, and yet the genius of Mirror lies not in WHAT is said, but in the WAY it is said. Tarkovsky convinces us throughout that the total experience is as relevant to us as it is to Russians and members of the Tarkovsky family. Somehow he enters our inner selves and conveys feelings and emotions that are completely our own. This can be the only explanation for my being so profoundly moved whenever I reacquaint myself with this masterpiece. Tarkovsky says: ""I am firmly convinced of one thing: That if an author is moved by the landscape chosen, if it brings back memories to him and suggests associations, even subjective ones, then it will in turn affect the audience with particular excitement"". For Mirror he rebuilt his childhood house in the country exactly the way it was in the 1930s and in exactly the same place. Not only that, he replanted the field in front of it with the buckwheat that grew there during that time. This created a very special atmosphere for the crew. ""What she [my mother] experienced was a return to her past; and then I knew we were moving in the right direction. The house awoke in her the feelings which the film was intended to express"". Because the feelings evoked in the people making the film are so powerful we in the audience can't help but empathize strongly with them. The essence of what Tarkovsky was aiming at in Mirror lies in the following: ""In the end we were saved by one thing alone  faith: the belief that since our work was so important to us it could not but become equally important to the audience. The film aimed at reconstructing the lives of people whom I loved dearly and knew well. I wanted to tell the story of the pain suffered by one man because he feels he cannot repay his family for all they have given him. He feels he hasn't loved them enough, and this idea torments him and will not let him be"". Sounds familiar doesn't it? These are obviously universal feelings that I think we can all empathize with and constitute our quest to wipe the slate clean and start again by loving more. Communing with this film is akin to opening our own hearts and souls to see fundamental truths latent within all of us.

The feeling that Tarkovsky is conveying universal emotions is shown by the events the film depicts. Take the opening scene of the mother sitting on the fence waiting it seems for someone to come. She watches a man gradually walk towards her across the field. The narrator suggests that she is waiting for her husband (the narrator's father) to return. For Russians familiar with the 1930s this refers to the disappearance of thousands of people during Stalin's purges and the resulting feelings of loneliness and nostalgia. However as she talks to the doctor we realize she is not married  she doesn't wear a wedding band. We see her sleeping children behind and know her loneliness may be caused by single parenthood brought on by divorce. This is autobiographical  Tarkovsky's parents divorced when he was young. But as the doctor flirts with the attractive divorce showing off his intelligence by referring to Chekhov's short story Ward 6 we realize that the scene which refers to the absent fathers of thousands afflicted by the purges and to Tarkovsky's own autobiography also refers to any woman in any society who is lonely and recently divorced. As the doctor walks away and stands in the field turning back to look at the mother we acknowledge the pathos of the situation existing on three levels at the same time. The printing house sequence works in the same way. Masha rushes into a printing factory convinced she has made a proof-reading mistake. Mistakes in Stalinist Russia were met with severe punishment and as she talks to her colleague Lisa (Alla Demidova ), her boss (Nikolai Grinko) and the frightened secretary we see that Russians would empathize with her plight having all been victims to some extent of Stalin themselves. We see Tarkovsky's family would empathize with what is a true incident even down to the argument where Lisa accuses Masha of being like Maria Timofeyevna (the snobby wife of Captain Lebyadkin in Dostoyevsky's The Devils). We also see non-Russians would empathize with the plight of any worker trapped in authoritarian working conditions.

The film's main background event is of course the Great Patriotic War that came to assume such symbolic importance for a nation that lost over 20 million people, but of course people from all countries who have survived wars will empathize with the effects of war as presented here. Two sequences dominate this part of the narrative  the firing range scene and the visit to the doctor's wife. The first is introduced by the boy Alexei looking at his first love  on one level the archetypal image of any boy's first love and on another perhaps the beauty that the war destroyed. Then we see the military instructor (Yuri Nazarov) controlling his students. One boy named Afasyev refuses to obey the 'about turn' command. We sympathize with his poor instructor, but when it's revealed that the boy's parents have been killed in the siege of Leningrad (a legendary event in the war depicting Russian resistance) our sympathy switches to the boy. When he hurls a fake grenade which the instructor shields from the students thinking it is live (effectively sacrificing himself for them) we understand both sides and the harrowing effect the war had on the nation. Similarly in the visit paid on the doctor's wife we can see the sacrifice of Masha (having to sell her ear-rings for food and having to kill the chicken against her will) as well as the needs of the doctor's wife. It is not necessary to be Russian for us to empathize with characters surviving the war. The newsreel footage also broadens the relevance. We see events in other countries, but even the footage of Soviet troops crossing Lake Sivash is universal. It is noteworthy that this post-Stalingrad footage was taken when Russia was winning the war, but it still shows a miserable picture of humanity trudging through a quagmire. War is an evil for victors and losers alike.

Tarkovsky no doubt chose the events of his film (including the newsreel footage) to universalize the total effect, but what really intensifies our empathy is the elusive way all events are inter-cut and blurred into one another to encourage an associative response. The film's structure can be compared to a series of mirrors reflected within mirrors and has encouraged some (Mark Le Fanu for example) to compare the film to a cubist painting. The biggest 'framing' mirror if you like is the totality of the film itself which reflects Tarkovsky's own autobiography. Beyond that, each character is reflected in different time periods. Natalya and Masha are both played by Margarita Terekhova while Ignat and the adolescent Alexei are both played by Ignat Daniltsev. Both Masha and Natalya are mirrored in turn by the reality of Maria Tarkovskaya, the very character they are playing. When Masha looks into a mirror early on in the film, Maria looks back at her. Later when Natalya looks at a photograph of herself beside Maria she remarks on their similarity. Similarly both Ignat and the young Alexei behave in exactly the same way. They are both portrayed by the off-screen narrator as dullish 'boobies' reflecting the narrator's own highly critical opinion of himself. This is emphasized by Ignat's reaction to being asked if he wants to live with his father or not and then later when the young Alexei accompanies his mother to visit the doctor's wife. He sits in the dark looking at his own reflection in a wall mirror without thinking of fixing the faulty gas light. And indeed, the mise-en-scne of Mirror is littered with mirrors and highly reflective surfaces which show events as if through several pairs of eyes. Most striking is the early dream sequence where the young Alexei remembers his mother washing her hair in a bowl of water. In a dank, eerie room typical of Tarkovsky's style she stands shaking her head in slow motion, her long hair pouring down over her face looking like a demented monster. Suddenly the mother isn't there and the room is shown with the ceiling collapsing down, water everywhere. Huge mirrors dominate the walls. Earlier the vision of the burning barn is introduced through reflections in glass and metal before the camera moves outside to showcase one of Tarkovsky's most famous images  the barn ablaze in the pouring rain as the main characters stand around and watch, the bucket clanking emptily against the side of a well to eerie effect  it's just the kind of touch a child would remember. The combination of the four elements is by now a given in every Tarkovsky film and doesn't need to be pointed out, but both the mother with the hair hanging down and the barn ablaze with the most magical flames showcase what the power of dreams and memory can do to one's imagining of past events. It is as if real events are 'reflected' through the mirror of dreams and memories to give Tarkovsky exactly what he wanted in this film. Make no mistake, this film is full of the most amazing results of this  the military instructor's brain pulsing violently through his shattered skull as he 'saves' his students, the mother levitating over a bed in mid-air as a bird flies obliquely across the top right corner of the screen, another bird 'blessing' Afasyev by alighting on his head, or simply the absent father present in the breeze that blows through the trees. The biggest mirror of course is the film itself in which we see various aspects of ourselves writ large by Tarkovsky's stupendous visual imagination.

In addition to the sheer richness of what we see there is the perfection of what we hear throughout this film. Carefully selected pieces of music by Bach, Purcell and Pergolesi are woven into an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev in a truly startling way. Examples are too many to mention here, but I have to highlight the sequence where the Spanish migr girl flamenco dances in Alexei's apartment. This cues up a startling sequence of images from the Spanish Civil War with the same music playing. Bombs fall, civilians rush for shelter and children wait at the dock to be evacuated. The sequence finishes on a heartbreaking shot of a cute girl clutching a teddy bear and looking into the camera. Cut to the Soviet army flying hot air balloons and the start of the concluding 'Quando corpus morietur' of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater. Just as the chorus enters Tarkovsky cuts to the Moscow May Day parade celebration. The destruction of war is followed by two positive scenes, the most joyous of which shown to the following words associated with the Ascension: ""While my body here is lying / let my soul be swiftly flying / to Thy glorious Paradise"". The music is here used brilliantly to opposite effect both to acknowledge the destruction of what has happened and also to anticipate the horror of what is to come. Another amazing sequence has the return of Alexei's father done to a burst from Bach's St. John Passion. As the father tearfully embraces his children we hear ""There was an earthquake, the rocks split, and the graves opened and many of God's people arose from sleep"" (Matthew 27:51-52). The return of the father comes as a resurrection not only of himself, but also of the feelings of his children and his wife whose face is compared directly with the face of Leonardo's Portrait of a Young Woman with a Juniper Twig in the very next shot. The Bach here is distorted by Artemyev to render an extraordinary oneiric effect. In fact Artemyev's 'electronic noises' are highly effective in rendering much of the film mystical and dream-like  the mother washing her hair followed by the collapsing room, the depiction of the troops crossing Lake Sivash and the sinister depiction of thousands of portraits of Chairman Mao, and most startling of all perhaps during the ghost scene when Ignat reads Pushkin. After the ghost of the old woman vanishes a circle of wet moisture left by a cup gradually disappears from the table top as the music wells up to a deafening crescendo. The effect leaves a lasting impression and cements the importance of the Pushkin reading that precedes it. Without the noise surely the reading may well have just flit by without notice. Most satisfying of all perhaps is the way the film concludes by bringing the characters of all three time periods together as one outside the dacha. Alexei's parents lie on the grass. The mother is pregnant with soon to be born Alexei and the father asks, ""Do you want a boy or girl?"" As we hear ""Lord, our master, whose glory fills the whole earth"" (the opening chorus from Bach's St. John Passion) Tarkovsky's camera explores the area around the house and we see all the characters at one in happy communion with nature. This amounts to an expression of the narrator's dearest hope that he can start again and this time show his loved ones the love they truly deserve. It is the spiritually-affirming hugely satisfying conclusion to a truly astonishing work of art.

I'm not sure words can do this film justice and I'm left feeling vaguely dissatisfied with what I have written here. Anyway, I strongly urge you to check out this Artificial Eye DVD.

333012,3,630154028X,"According to many, The Mirror is Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's best film. Certainly it is his most personal. It might look at first sight like a rambling series of confusing scenes, but the movie actually has a plot of sorts. The movie is reportedly based on Tarkovsky's own life. Basically we have a collection of vignettes (though in the film they are not shown chronologically). We have the protagonist as a boy (he is presumably based on Tarkovsky) living in a house with his mother (Margarita Terekhova in an intense performance) in the countryside before World War II, we see him later as a teenager training shooting with a rifle (with a stern instructor) presumably during the war, we see the absent father returning after World War II in soldier's uniform, we see the mother having a bad day in her job as proofreader in a printing house (that was actually Tarkovsky's mother real job), we see after the war how the boy has become a man (though he is never shown as an adult) and how he argues with his former wife (played also by Terekhova) about how to raise their troubled son called Ignat, we see a female doctor use hypnosis to try to cure Ignat's stuttering. Intercalated with these vignettes, we have documentary footage of the Spanish Civil War, of World War II, China's Cultural Revolution, the Chinese-Soviet border clashes during the late 1960. We also have surreal scenes of the mother levitating in the house, we have the child walking in the wintry countryside in a recreation of Brueghel's painting ""The Hunters in the Snow"", we have the boy slowly perusing an art book. All to the music of Bach and Purcell and to poetry recitation by Tarkovksy's father Arseni.

Many people have liked this film a lot, and I'm not denying Tarkovsky's seriousness or artistry, but I really wished that I would have like this movie more. This is very personal stuff to him, but maybe his reminiscences are too personal to be able to move me much.",1399766400,3,1959,4.711370262390671
333013,5,630154028X,"Ignat, the narrator's son says : Electricity, It's like it's all happening before but I haven't been here before.
Interpretive Spoilers:

 Mirror: our lives mirror those which have gone before us. In this case the narrator, Alyosha, divorced from his wife Nataliya, whose son Ignat is growing up without him and is developing problems, repeats the tragedy he suffered - growing up without a father. However, the whole film reads as a tone poem dedicated to the [often widowed] women of his mother, Maria's, generation, and to the children whose families were broken up by the wars  of the 20th century. Viewed from that perspective all the imagery falls into place and is linked.

In the first scene solitary Maria smokes, looking out onto the landscape. A charming doctor, passing,  flirts with her, but she is unmoved. Where is her husband? Has he been taken in the purges, why are they separated? We don't know yet. A nearby house burns as she and her children watch. We then segue into a beautiful and disturbing dream; a call from the irritating old mother to the grown narrator, and a scene from the 1930's during Stalin's reign of terror , where Maria is terrified of having made an editorial mistake in the publishing house where she works. We discover her husband has left her.

We then move to friends of Nataliya and the narrator, a Spanish/ Russian family , and their memories of the Spanish Civil War- between the forces of fascism and communism. However, more than that, the Spaniard speaks of the separation of father and son, and we see newsreel footage of children being taken from their families [ evacuated?] --they are so helpless, so little and so alone.

 Now  we see a balloon in flight--then a book of Leonardo Da Vinci's drawings-- the man who invented many such flying machines as well as weaponry, which Ignat , the narrator's son, is leafing through. We notice Leonardo's Madonnas  look very much like Maria/Nataliya.

Ignat, says to his mother who is in a rush to go somewhere and spills the contents of her handbag : Electricity, It's like its all happening before but I haven't been here before.

He's alone in an apartment  waiting for his grandmother but doesn't recognize her when she comes to the door/ neither does she him. The apartment becomes much grander and a lady beckons Ignat to read a letter from Pushkin where Russia's separation from Europe is discussed.  The phone rings, the narrator is calling, knowing his son is alone. He asks do you have friends? [ this scene will be linked later to one where the narrator is sitting in an izba while his mother sells her jewels for a chicken where he understands he is a solitary being] When I was your age I loved a red-headed girl etc.

The memory of the redheaded girl is the transition to a wartime scene, where sharp shooting is being practiced [ this was a national pastime, a skill then utilized when the youth, including girls, were formed into squads of snipers deployed against the Germans]. The instructor dresses down a boy, only to learn his parents have been killed in the siege of Leningrad[ 22- 25 million dead in WWII and many children left orphaned] . We see terrible footage of the war--and Pushkin's letter about Russia's destiny is recalled--for Europeans [Germans] Russians will always be the other, subhuman, Asiatics,  but now comes the absent father's poetry that is imbued with spirituality: Fear not Death, not at 17 or at 70, we are all immortal, and there is only light.  There's a line there that says something about the house that won't crumble, meaning though the country is under siege it will hold up --but the house in the beginning burned and the family was separated.

How should things be? The orphaned boy is sledding in a scene straight out of Bruegel -- yet we see the dead body of Hitler, the bomb thrown on Hiroshima, the Chinese Revolution, the break between the Chinese and Russians--endless turmoil and violence. We return  to Leonardo's lady who looks like Maria, and Father coming home from on leave the war to visit the children.

We are again in the present where Ignat is troubled, used as a pawn against his mother by the narrator who torments and humiliates Nataliya, and analyzes how they've grown bourgeois [ perhaps that is why his grandmother doesn't recognize him, or perhaps because she has seen him so little] until they see Ignat has started a fire in the courtyard.

Now the narrator dreams of the 1930's again when everything was ahead of him, before he was damaged and before he damaged others. The world was still whole--the family was intact.  There is beautiful imagery of that wholeness, of the rain, the forest, the wind, and then a jarring memory of their wartime exile without a father in the country: mother and the last of their potatoes.

 She decides to sell her jewels for a chicken. When she gets to the woman's house where she will trade--she spills everything she is carrying on the floor--a link with the earlier electricity scene. The narrator Alyosha, who is with her,  is in tatters, he is ill, he is barefoot and  hungry--and yet she cannot bear the death of the chicken and runs away. While he  waits for her he looks into a mirror and realizes his terrible solitude, noticing an excess of milk spilling over, and the woman, who has a husband to do for her, wearing silk, and  her fat well fed child sleeping amidst starched white sheets.

And now he understands who his mother is, and sees her with her handsome husband, whom she never stops grieving for , who is gone, whom she dreams of, and when she is ill, and in her illness floats above the bed, whose voice she hears speaking tenderly as if he loved and cared for her.

Then Alyosha walks through lace curtains to the time before the war, to the time before his birth when his mother and father are lying in a field and father asks her if she is hoping for a boy or a girl--but in her happiness she grows sad--because she sees her terrible solitary future and herself growing old, left alone with the children.

So we come full circle. Is the narrator dying  as some say? Or is he going to recover from his soul sickness; and in freeing the captive bird,  free himself of his  inability to communicate-just as the stuttering young boy in the first scene was freed.",1386115200,2,6296,4.647430117222723

The Russian version (in fact the original) is far superior. Tarkovsky is my favorite director, he was a genius, and I saw all his seven films. They are all haunting, a quest for the spiritual dimension of life. The Mirror is his chef d'oeuvre, in my humble opinion. In my personal ranking of all the films I've seen so far, it is nr. 1.",1319673600,3,472,4.314606741573034
333042,5,630154028X,"The film, although it received mixed critical reviews, was obviously thought of highly enough by Soviet authorities because, after initially not wanting to release it, they did, but refused its entry into film festivals like Venice of Cannes, for fear that it would win, and thus draw more attention to Tarkovsky's non-agitprop works. The irony is that, had Tarkovsky, and other artists, been allowed to pursue their art unfettered, it would have reflected all the greater on the Soviet system. Having seen earlier and later films of his, I can say that The Mirror is likely Tarkovsky's best film- not a perfect film, but a great film, and easily. Earlier works culminated in this, while later works stole from it. Tarkovsky, himself, wrote this, in his memoirs: `(the film) has demonstrated to me, again, how well founded my conjecture about the importance of personally experienced emotion was in telling a story onscreen. Perhaps cinema is the most personal art, the most intimate. In cinema only the author's intimate truth will be convincing enough for the audience to accept.' In actuality, cinema is second, in that regard, to poetry; but then cinema is closer to poetry than any other art in giving its creator an almost God-like ability over time and space. However, its visual element does make it more accessible to many than poetry; if not more intimate.

  The biggest critical boner about the film, however, seems to be the idea that the lead character, Alexei, dies in the film, or that the film is about his death, in either memory or toto. Yet, this simply is not a sustainable claim because, as mentioned earlier, the scene in which Alexei supposedly `dies,' is done in a blackly comic sort of way- with two old babushkas kvetching about Alexei possibly dying, even though he may only have strep throat. Yet, by virtue of the images of his memory we have seen to that point, Alexei clearly embellishes to a point of heightened reality, in the least, and melodrama, at most. Therefore, if he is the source of the claim of impending death, it is suspect. Clearly the two babushkas are not credible sources since they seem puzzled by the claim. The so-called doctor in the scene seems not too concerned, either. Likely, Alexei is hypochondriacal. The other pillar for the claim of death is when we see Alexei grip and release a small bird upward in the air. First, the image is so trite, and obviously so, that Tarkovsky, if this was his intent, made an error in judgment that is very bad, for it thuds the film flat. Instead, given the absurdity of the scene, this is likelier Alexei's own melodramatic tendencies coming to the fore again, and him trying to paint an end to the scene, not his life, for Alexei does, at times in the film, seem to break the fourth wall in his recall. Also, the bird does not fly free from Alexei's dead hand. His hand heaves up and releases the bird. It's a toss- a thing that would not occur in a last gesture. Given these visual certainties, the far likelier scenario is that, perhaps, this may be the present state of the film, with Alexei `s memory the rest of the film to that point. The end, with his mother's learning of her pregnancy with him, is just Andrei's exclamation point after the melodrama with the bird. Or, as I stated earlier, the whole film may be a flashforth with a return to the present of his mother at the `start' of his life.

  On the flip side, there are several good scenes that stand out narratively and have other import. The best is the dig at Stalinism and censorship when we see Alexei's mom freaking out over a possible typographical error at her job. She clearly fears staining her record, and the consequences that may bring. That this worry is compounded by the overt aggression of her co-worker makes for a scene where personal and professional ills collide convincingly, and the scene ends in a shower, where she relieves her stress by laughing. During the dummy grenade scene, when the drill instructor pounces on the grenade, we see his fear reflected in the pulses of his forehead where skull has clearly been removed- likely in a shrapnel explosion. It is eerie, realistic, and memorable. There is a scene where we see spilt milk and the odd coalescence of milk on a floor, or in the scene where Ignat reads Pushkin's letter aloud, then returns after opening the door, to find her gone. It seems a dream, except we see a moist condensation stain that evaporates on the wooden table, suggesting it was `real.' This scene prefigures similar scenes of ghosts in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just five years later.

  But, then, in a sense, Alexei may or may not be a ghost- a possible person, or a past person. Certainly he embodies his nation, and the film is not wholly from his point of view. There are scenes, such as parts of the dummy grenade scene or when his mother frets over a possible typo, that simply cannot have been known by Alexei, unless he is more than just a human character- perhaps an amalgam of persons and idea(l)s absorbed by his surroundings. After all, early on the doctor tells his mother that some believe that plants have senses of perception. Similarly, some of the newsreels used in the film make no sense, as they are, nor in the context of the film, until one considers that not all memories make sense. Things rarely make sense in a fugue, anyway, and that's what The Mirror is- a visual fugue on thought and memory, and a great one. Compare it to any of David Lynch's similarly posited films, and Tarkovsky's film's superiority is manifest, for Lynch's films are piffle, in contrast. From literary references (Chekhov's Ward No. 6) to historical context to self-referentiality (a scene where a film poster of Tarkovsky's own Andrei Rublev hangs) to visual sleight of hand to characterization by accumulation, The Mirror succeeds as a great film by simultaneously being as large as everything while focusing on the trivia of life that one rarely recalls. Yet, the film never bores, it invites rewatch to re-trigger memories of it and one's own. Rare is the trigger that is also a bullet. Bang!",1283299200,6,6119,4.705882352941177
333043,4,630154028X,"Tarkovsky's ""The Mirror""(1975) is more like a visual poem than a narrative story. Images jump forward and backward in time depicting thoughts and emotions of Alexei (Ignat Daniltsev) from childhood, and as an adult, from prewar to postwar. This is largely an autobiographical film that references back to Tarkovsky's childhood. Poetry written and spoken by Tarkovsky's father is intermingled with scenes. Mirrors are constantly being used. Sometimes mirrors are used like windows into the future. In one scene Alexei's mother, Maria (Margarita Terekhova), is looking into a mirror and sees an old woman (herself in the future). This scene then transitions into the old woman's present time. There are some instances like this in the film where one is reminded of scenes from Stanely Kubrick's film ""2001"" (1968) where one leaps forward in time or seems to be looking into the future. This film depicts the gaze as a reflection of the world of memories divorced from time, and so the mirror, the reflection of self, can be seen as a metaphor of the ephemeral, and as a window into memory and dreams.

This film is in 1.33:1 aspect ratio and has not been remastered. It has color and black and white sequences. The audio is Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo in Russian with English subtitles.

333048,5,630154028X,"Tarkovsky's fourth feature length film was also his most overtly personal project, in which he creates a kind of mirror of his own life: growing up in Russia during WWII, raised largely by his mother with a distant father, going through divorce.  It is a kind of collage of images, depicting the life of a child who becomes an unseen narrator, whose life becomes a kind of repetition of the life of his father, and whose mother is played by the same actress who ends up playing his estranged wife.  The past blends with the present; documentary footage of life during wartime blends with lifelike recreations; dreamlike sequences blend with depictions of harsh realities.  It is an intriguing film - almost unprecedented in its experimental approach to autobiography.  Perhaps the closest parallel in cinema is with the films of Chris Marker, notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sans-Soleil/dp/B000OPPADS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sans Soleil</a>, in which highly personal reflections, displaced onto a fictional narrator and accompanied by richly evocative imagery, are elevated into reflections on time and memory and culture that transcend their semi-autobiographical locus.  The film's images will resonate profoundly with those who have seen Tarkovsky's other works.  Essential viewing for those who appreciate the work of Tarkovsky - even if it is probably not the best introduction to his work - and highly recommended for lovers of inventive approaches to cinema, or to those interested in Russian culture and history.

It's hard to know what to say about this dvd transfer; I've seen the film projected from an old print more than a decade ago and as far as I recall this version looks better than that.  I'm happy to have it available on dvd at all, and can say that the power of the film does come across in Kino's version.

333049,5,630154028X,"Mirror is Andrei Tarkovsky's visually transcendent, artistically revelatory autobiographical film on lost innocence and emotional abandonment. Presented as a languidly paced, achronological cinematic montage of modern day life, personal memories, historical news footage, and dreams, Mirror is an introspective journey through the course of human existence, hope and despair, success and frailty: a television broadcast of a young man seemingly cured from stuttering through hypnosis; a neglected wife (Margarita Terekhova) humoring a village doctor who has lost his way; a custodial argument between a faceless narrator (Innokenty Smoktunovsky) and his ex-wife; a precocious young man trying the patience of his military instructor (Yuri Nazarov). To attempt to conform these images into some coherent plot or universal conclusion is meaningless. After all, Mirror is a reflection of Tarkovsky's haunted soul: his search for spirituality, connection, Truth - exposed through indelible images that inevitably define our own imperfect lives, however trivial or mundane.

Andrei Tarkovsky deliberately obscures time by using the same actors to portray the two phases of the narrator's life: the fatherless boy attempting to reach out to his distracted mother, and the distant father unable to relate to his self-absorbed son. Anachronistic newsreels of world events are interspersed to provide environmental reference and tonal shift. The structure of the film constantly evolves through the use of flashbacks and flash forwards, defined through chromatic shifts. This results in a film that is thematically cyclical, reflecting the narrator's pattern of alienation and emotional isolation. The absence of logical order in the film elicits a visceral reaction from the audience: the knowledge that we have experienced truth in all its intoxicating beauty and desperate longing... and perhaps even a brief connection with the artist himself.",1262822400,3,1938,5.848056537102473
333050,5,630154028X,"The points made by other reviewers about this film's nonlinearity and being much like poetry are, of course, valid. I remember seeing it for the first time back in the 70s and realising that I was in the presence of a radically new kind of art: exciting and powerful but also almost alien, as if the film had been imported from Mars. Then the world cinema started to catch up little by little, but as the 80s turned into the 90s the mainstream went simplistic again, and today's young viewers of the 'Mirror' are, in all likelihood, having the very same thoughts about a film from Mars. We can only guess whether the new language of cinema introduced by Tarkovsky 35 years ago will ever be widely adopted.

However, there is a coherent story there too - and its existence is often missed or even vehemently denied. It is essentially the life story of the narrator, who never appears in the frame as an adult, but through whose eyes many of the scenes are presented. The man has his share of human flaws, yet his perception is particularly sharp, and his mind and spirit are attuned to the history and destiny of his country and to the cultural heritage of the humankind - the latter represented in the film by the music and visual references to famous paintings, which elevate the action and place it in the global context. There are repeated hints in the film that these personal qualities - a mixed blessing to put it mildly - run in the family and hence will go on even though the narrator dies in his 40s. The words of the smoking doctor in the deathbed scene (who is played by the co-author of the screenplay) are mistranslated in the English subtitles, but the key part comes across: the man is dying because there are such things as memory and conscience.

The storyline requires a bit of effort to comprehend - not because it was made obscure by Tarkovsky, but because of the impact of the following factors:

First of all, the action moves backwards and forwards between three time planes: 1930s, 1940s and 1970s. Recognisable time markers are provided most of the time, but it is still possible to get confused, so it is important to pay full attention to what is shown and said. This difficulty is not unlike the one that a reader might have in comprehending the storyline of 'The Sound and the Fury' by Faulkner, who at one stage even contemplated a special edition of the novel with fragments set in different time printed in different colours.

Secondly, what we see in the film is not only the supposed reality but also memories (distorted as they always are), dreams (with their own logic that can never be fully grasped) and prophetic visions (one example: a boy on a snow-covered hillside takes in the view which re-creates the 'Hunters in the Snow' by Bruegel, and sees not only the forthcoming end of the war but also the much later border conflict with China). Again, it is not too difficult to figure out which scene falls into which category.

Thirdly, the same actress plays the narrator's mother and his ex-wife. Similar things have been done in many other films; nevertheless, I heard form several people that this, rather than anything else, was what confused them most in the 'Mirror'. In fact, the two characters look, act and speak considerably differently (a credit to the actress!), and in any case the time plane of any given episode makes it clear which of the two women appears in it: nobody is time-travelling in this film, except for the very last sequence where time is warped or rather absent altogether.

Those factors are vital for the structure of the 'Mirror' and contribute to its outstanding artistic qualities and cult status, but they can also put off viewers who are either unable or unwilling to play by the rules laid down by Tarkovsky. But then again, isn't this problem common to all true art?",1254182400,7,3845,4.6304985337243405
333051,3,630154028X,"I have three versions of the film on DVD now--the Kino, the Ruscico, and the Russian Krupny Plan version (without subtitles).

Kino's transfer is not bad considering its age; my main critique is that the color balance is overly cool. The RUSCICO edition looks better in some respects but the print is slightly pinkish and some of the scenes are transfered overly bright, as Vlad, another reviewer, has noted.

I agree that Kino's subtitles are frustratingly incomplete in several dialogue scenes. It's a pity, because there are many wonderful small exchanges between the characters that really add texture to the script. The RUSCICO subtitles are more complete but they terribly botch the poetry, which is central to the film's effect. That sin is not easily forgiven, and for that reason alone you should get the Kino version.

Visually, neither version can hold a candle to the stunning new digital restoration that Mosfilm has released on DVD in Russia through Krupny Plan. In an ideal world, Kino would license the new Mosfilm transfer and beef up the subtitles. In the meantime, you might as well go with the current Kino DVD. ""The Mirror"" is Tarkovsky's greatest work and a masterpiece of world cinema--it's the kind of film you find yourself returning to now and then to savor its elusive beauty.",1233619200,10,1303,4.940639269406392

333053,4,630154028X,"'The Mirror' is Tarkovsky's autobiographical masterpiece about which there is both little and a lot to say. As all his work, seeing this movie is something one must experience as it is such a different kind of cinema as that of any other director. Not a movie for those with a short attention span one could argue that The Mirror is about the overwhelming power that memories can have on our lives. As stated the movie more or less is autobiographic as we see Tarkovsky's childhood years in the country, to which many Russians fled from WWII, brought there by his mother. His father, the famous Russian poet Arsenii Tarkovsky is not present, except through citations from his poetry by means of a voice over, while we look at beautiful Russian scenery or archive images of soldiers walking through swamps. Apart from a visual feast the movie also offers an auditorial banquet not only of recited poems but also wonderful music, which plays a crucial part (as always in Tarkovsky's movies).
The story timeline of the movie at first viewing may prove to be somewhat confusing, as there is continuous interplay between past and present. In the present time of the movie the main character is a divorced man, obviously an intellectual, who both spiritually as well as emotionally is in a crisis. In this state he has a series of childhood recollections and the movie throws in an extra free of charge bit of 20th century Russian history into the mix. It is shown how he grew up in the country, how Spanish civil war survivors fled to Russia, how he was military trained in Leningrad as a boy during WWII and got to know his first love, how his mother lived in a printing shop under Stalin's censorship, Soviet-Chinese border tensions after the Chinese revolution etc.
Confusing in all this is that his mother in the flashbacks is played by the same actress as the main protagonist's current ex-wife, even though he says as much in a phonecall with his ex that when he has childhood recollections of his mother she always looks like his ex. The story itself is pretty simple, but it's complex through the way it is structured, especially the first time one sees the movie, but this is true for any Tarkovsky movie. Each movie  should be watched at least three times to get any kind of understanding of what they are about, which however doesn't mean one can't immensely enjoy them first time around. What worked for me on first viewings was not over analyzing too much and simply let the movie take me along, the perfect acting, the beauty of the images, the musical splendor and magnificent poetry.
This was the first Tarkovsky movie I ever saw a long time ago and it changed the way I looked at art in general and cinema in particular.
It's my sincere wish to any Tarkovsky 'newbie' to have a similar wonderful experience.
The one star missing in my judgment is due to the rather bad visual quality of this release, which is quite a shame and, as a Russian friend assured me, quite bad translation. (Luckily Moskwood did a better job on both counts.)",1224028800,2,3047,4.642592592592592

There is also a b/w footage called Memory, as well as composer Eduard Artemyev's tribute to Andrei using his original score and scenes from Mirror to create a sort of music video.  There is a filmography and also a photo album.

RUSCICO does go to lengths to make this a more enjoyable edition, and why shouldn't they?  This is agreed by many to be the flagship movie from recent Russian cinema, made by one of their most important and celebrated directors.

I know there are websites devoted to comparing different transfers of Tarkovsky's movies. The age-old Kino vs. R.U.S.C.I.C.O.. They both have their pluses and minuses. There is first, the difference in color. This RUSCICO edition is less saturated, and the audio track has is more spot-on, with much less reverb. And then there is the matter of translation.

I consider myself a huge fan of Andrei Tarkovski's work. I own both versions, and had to obtain it long before Amazon even carried it. (They are the same editions though). I am reminded of an old scratchy King Pleasure record I own. It's been played for so many years, you could hear every scratch, pop, and click on it. But it doesn't take away the least bit from the enjoyment. Why? Because IT IS THE QUALITY OF THE WORK THAT COUNTS, not the quality of the media.

I have seen this movie on the big screen at Lincoln Center in New York City recently (and to my eyes, the RUSICICO EDITION is closer- color wise-to what was shown at Lincoln Center), carefully restored with corrected translation. I came home and watched both my copies the next day to compare. In my opinion, as a non-Russian speaker (but a graduated English major), the minor discrepancies and lack of transfer DOES NOT outweigh the fantastic quality of film-making presented here.

Tarkovsky is one of the recent Russian film greats, and this movie is seen by many as the apex of his creativity. Last time I checked, film is more than mere images. It is audio, visual, script, angles, color combined to tell a story. You have Tarkovsky's father (the acclaimed Russian poet Arseny Tarkovsky) reciting his stately poems in his rich voice over long continuous shots detailing the director's childhood memory in the countryside, when his father went off to fight the war.

Created scenes intersect with historical footage to present a fugal magnum opus onscreen. Tarkovsky studied Arabic in the university, and he had a love of J.S. Bach's music (which is present here along with Purcell's works and Eduard Artemyev) which means he has an appreciation from Zakhrafa art and labyrinthian schemes. For those who may not be familiar with Bach's compositions, three or four melodies interweave with each other to create a *fugue*, which uses sound to play off each other in a device called counterpoint. Tarkovsky recreates this structure visually, where time is nonlinear, and each actor plays several characters, switching between present and past.

This is Tarkovsky's way of presenting our persona as a composite of all our experiences and memory.

Do yourself a favor. Don't wait for the right version. This movie is strong enough to pull through all the scratches, pops, hiss, clicks, and color discrepancies.",1210377600,7,3385,4.910683012259194

333057,5,630154028X,"This is a case where there can be no argument whatsoever: Ruscico's ""Zerkalo"" wins hands-down. The image is far superior, the audio is vastly superior (so clear that things can be heard whose existence would not even be suspected on the Kino disk), and the subtitles are more extensive and clearer.

Allow me to mention: The audio I refer to on Ruscico's disk is the original mono; the drastically-modified 5.1 mix is an abomnation. (It proves, however, that there are no such things as ghosts -- if there were, Andrei's would bedevil the guy that did the 5.1 remix till the end of his life.) From what I've read, not all editions of the Ruscico DVD include the mono track, so beware! On the subject of subtitles, I have to say that I far prefer Russian-written English subs to English-written English subs any day. The Russian-written subs may be ungrammatical and contain Russian idioms you may not catch, but they are far subtler and clearer (and usually more extensive) than any written by a native English-speaker.

An interesting additional tidbit on the Ruscico disk: Check the photo gallery to see how Andrei achieved the lovely wind effect at the end of the scene between Margareta Terekhova and Anatoly Solonitsyn.

To recount things like a fantastic cast or a riveting camera-work feels trivial--these are givens when dealing with Tarkovsky. The magic lies elsewhere. Tarkovsky called his film-making sculpting in time and this phrase suits The Mirror perfectly. The richness of its imagery is reminiscent of that other great sculptor in time--Marcel Proust. Watching The Mirror feels very different from reading Proust, but Tarkovsky has that unparalleled understanding of memory that Proust has in literature. The film is not surreal or strange or difficult to watch; to the contrary, it feels bewitchingly light and liquid. It does not look as a dream or a flashback, but memories never do--although they are often represented as such on the silver screen. And yet Tarkovsky's luxurious pacing and exquisite framing are also dream-like in their haunting beauty and power of absorption. In The Mirror, as in The Remembrance of Things Past, memories are not representations of reality; they are reality. Watching the film feels as if someone caught your memory in a mirror and reflected it back. What you see is at once both personal and social--a view into your innermost emotions as well as their historical fabric. Its realism lies not in the specific events it portrays but in the structure of feeling it captures. Every Tarkovsky film has left me somewhere between a shock and a trance, totally dumbfounded that a film can be like this, and none more than The Mirror.

The fullscreen format is a huge problem (I have to assume, never having seen Mirror in widescreen), as one the great joys with Tarkovsky is his mastery of widescreen.  And the translation is very bothersome; I know no Russian, but it is obvious that a significant portion of the dialog is never translated.  We have to assume the skipped portions are unimportant to the story, but what a distraction.  This DVD takes what should be a 5 star experience for Tarkovsky fans, and turns it into 3 stars.

I am fairly new to Tarkovsky:  I really love Stalker, one of my favorite movies of all time.  Solyaris is very good, although a bit depressing for my tastes.  Mirror I am more than willing to work with (and understanding it clearly requires work: other reviewers suggest doing some background reading combined with multiple viewings).

333087,5,630154028X,"There is a scene in Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror where a young child looks through a book of art.  The camera is close, showing only the pages of the book and the child's hand as he flips from picture to picture.  Occasionally he will stop and linger on a favorite drawing.  It is obvious that the book is a treasured possession, whose pictures have yet to lose their magic for the young boy.  At one point a leaf, pressed between the pages, comes into view only to be swallowed up again.

This seemingly innocuous scene, halfway through the movie, is just one small example of why The Mirror is unquestionably my favorite movie ever.  The film is the pure essence of nostalgia and each viewing is a revelation of memories I had long thought lost.  I too had certain favorite books that I would turn to over and over again, flipping through their pages and taking comfort in the familiar pictures.  I too would often press flowers and leaves between the pages of books with my parents.

Watching this movie feels like memories of the past flooding back from some forgotten abyss.  The grey rainy skies, the kittens licking up cream, the flickering kerosene lantern, the sledding on the hill, the small junk pile in the forest, the snow covered trees, the wooden floors and furniture, the windswept fields, the log fence, all of these things are important images from my childhood.  And yet there is far more to The Mirror than that.

Tarkovsky reaches beyond mere concrete memories.  Many moments in the film have an almost mystical appeal.  The slow static shot of the disappearing handprint on the table mesmerizes the eye until the final trace has gone.  The bottle that inexplicably rolls off the table seems to act of its own volition.  The man walking away in a great field of grass who turns to the camera just as one mighty gust of wind sweeps across the field towards the viewer and is gone.  Scenes such as these are joined seamlessly with the movie and serve to reinforce the almost dreamlike reality we are presented with.

The music, selected from Pergolesi, Purcell, and J.S. Bach is, amazingly, equal to the images.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the superlative final scene set to Bach's monumental opening chorus from St. John's Passion.  It is the single most moving scene I have ever viewed on film, its central images consisting of little more than a woman biting her lip and a child shouting a great life affirming cry to the skies while Bach's painfully beautiful music builds to an epic climax.  The perfect union of film and music found in this scene is staggering in its power.

I suspect I am not the only one who considers himself a kindred spirit to The Mirror.  Growing up in rural Kansas without a great deal of money surely helps, but the images are more universal than the tone of these passages lets on.  Perhaps that is part of The Mirror's appeal: to those who identify with it, it seems as though the movie was made only for them.

This theory gains a great deal of credence when I think of the parts of The Mirror I don't feel such a strong connection to.  I had no lack of a father figure as a child yet that dominant plot point somehow doesn't stand in the way of my identification with the movie.  I obviously didn't grow up in the middle of a war and have no connection with Russian politics and history, but again, it makes no difference.  Oddly enough, these two central ideas in the movie don't even seem to register when I look back on it.

So just what is the mirror about?  The Time Out film guide sums it up quite well saying: ""Tarkovsky goes for the great white whale of politicized art - no less than a history of his country in this century seen in terms of the personal - and succeeds.""  That is a rather broad description and not a particularly exciting one.  Of course if that were all that the movie was about, I would not be writing this review.

When it comes down to it, The Mirror is an elusive film to classify.  I've seen it over and over and still have a hard time getting a firm grip on its structure.  Powerful images with their own internal logic flit by, skittering at the edges of our consciousness like the memories of a lost day from our childhood.  Complex narratives follow children and adults, past and present.  Powerful documentary footage is interspersed along with slow motion dream sequences.  The closest description I can come up with is that The Mirror is a collection of images, all related and all central to the human experience.

The Mirror is Tarkovsky's finest film, and for certain kindred souls it truly will be a mirror.  A mirror to every memory long thought lost, it will show each person who looks a different reflection.",1185926400,12,4722,4.542011834319527

I was really provoked to wonder what other viewers thought, and to me that's one of the hallmarks of a great cinematic experience. The only reason I'm not rating it at 5 stars is that the poor/incomplete translation given by the subtitles is obvious. Hopefully if you're thinking of purchasing this, you're reading all the reviews, because many have great insight and helpful descriptive observations. The one thing it amazes me no one mentions, particularly given the title, is the use of mirrors -they are almost a character, despite having no spoken dialogue! I was fascinated to see how many were used throughout the film, along with reflective surfaces and liquids. The thought that struck me was no matter how many mirrors surrounded these characters or how close or far away from them they stood, they were either unable to see, or steadfast about refusing to see themselves clearly. At one point there is a scene in a doctor's office, which (as bizarre as it would seem) also has a wall mounted with a collection of mirrors. A diagnosis is being discussed while the patient is not seen; there is a folding screen present though...what is the idea? Are we unable to see the patient, but only his reflection in the ""mirror"" of the others? Is the patient given the opportunity to choose to hide from us- or perhaps to hide from seeing his reflection? Is he even in the room, though I felt it implied he was behind the screen? I'm not sure at all, but I am fascinated. If you are a patient viewer, or an unrepentent film geek, buy it, or find some way to try it as a rental before you do. If you're not, if you're out there seeing whatever was the highest grossing movie last weekend, I doubt you'll see anything here you'll like -of course, we can always hope-there is magic and quite a lot of poetry in this one.",1174435200,,1975,4.566197183098591

I should not have worried - I love it even more now if that is at all possible. I've seen it at different times of my life - first, as a college student many years ago in Moscow; I keep returning to it all my life.

When Tarkovsky's Zerkalo (The Mirror) was first released, it divided the audience completely. I remember how my friends were passionately discussing it. One girl was complaining that she did not understand anything; the movie was confusing for her, dark, disturbing, the children characters - sad, pale, poorly dressed. I remember her asking, ""Why did they show a boy in the opening scene that had an awful stutter, and they never showed that boy again? What did it mean when the dying man in bed was setting a bird free? How did he get the bird on the first place?"" Another friend of mine, a guy, tried to explain the things to her. He suggested that she thought about the times Zerkalo was showing, he tried to explain to her Tarkovsky's symbolism where the bird could be representing life and soul of the main character and the boy with the stutter could mean that it was most difficult for people to communicate and understand each other.

I only listened to their argument and did not participate because I had not seen the film yet. When it finally happened, Andrei Arsenievich Tarkovsky was presented at the screening and he talked to the audience before the show. I remember him repeating over and over that there were no tricks, no puzzles, and no tongue-in-cheeks in the film; that every symbol, image, dialog, and sound was there because they belonged there. He asked us if we had questions. Someone from the audience suggested that we saw the film first, and then, asked questions. Tarkovsky replied that from his experience, not many viewers would sit through the film and who ever would, usually leave in silence, not asking anything. And then he told us a story. After Zerkalo was completed, it was first shown to the group of the famous critics. After watching it, critics started to argue about it, trying to find the hidden meaning and make sense of what they just saw. It went on and on until the cleaning lady who came to the screening room and had been waiting for the end of discussion to do her job, asked them for how long they would stay? Someone said to her that they were discussing a very complicated film, and they needed time to understand it. Cleaning lady asked, ""What is that you do not understand in this film? I saw it also, and I understood everything."" Critics were silenced for a moment, and then, one of them asked the woman to share her thoughts on Zerkalo. She answered, ""It is about a man who had caused too much pain to the ones whom he loved and who loved him. Now he is dying and he is trying to ask them for forgiveness but he does not know how."" After the pause Tarkovsky said that he had nothing else to add about his film to what the cleaning lady had to say.

I never understood complains that Zerkalo is a very confusing, difficult, and dark film. No, it is clear and deep as a mirror. Every time you look at the mirror, it will show you new depth and reflections. Past, presence, future, memory, love, guilt, forgiveness, beauty, sadness, nostalgia, and sacrifice - the mirror reflects it all -just watch closely.

Remember Alain Resnais' ""Last year at Marienbad"" in which present and past are mixed together and dissolve in each other without technical warnings for the audience. Resnais, by the way, did the same in his landmark debut ""Hiroshima mon Amour"" and would make a carreer out of movies in which chronological way of story telling is thrown out of the window very early on.

  Also the great Spanish surrealist Luis Bu?uel enjoyed confusing his viewers this way with films like ""The Exterminating angel"", ""The phantom of liberty"" and ""The discrete charme of the bourgeoisie"", mixing seemingly realistic moments with surrealistic immagery and dreamlike-sequences.

  Of the nowadays successful operating directors, David Lynch is perhaps the most widely known, with his non-logical, or rather a-logical movie puzzles like ""Lost Highway"" and his masterful creation ""Mullholland Dr.""

""Mirror"" now, is an intimate view of ordinary life in Russia seen through the eyes of someone who doesn't seem to share much onscreen time. The result, in the hands of  the amazing Andrej Tarkovski, is however not ordinary but extraordinary in the biggest sence of the word. Startling images follow one another up in fast time, in a movie that is, on the contrary, to say the least, deliberatly paced (as are all of Tarkovski's efforts, who, all of his film carreer and, wanted spirituallity and contemplation as main goals.)

Water, fire, wind, poems, all elements are part of the memories we witness, as are the faces that pass by the camera, faces filled with, or rather scarred by, deeply rooted maturity unexplained sorrow, and sheer character.

  In less gifted hands, all shown technical flares would be just show-offs, but Tarkovski makes sure that every everlasting vision portrayed here, is not only top-notch in its form, but is also the basic for his story telling and is quiet hunt of meditation. And although ""Mirror"" sees to be more a labyrinth of associative imagery and mis-en-sc?ne than a straight forward narrative, it's a huge story one can find `between the poetic lines' if one is patient enough to go along with Tarkovsi's own private sculpting of time.

At the end, ""Mirror"" is more than anything a cinematic experience, it's a movie that reflects both vision and thoughts... pondering and meandering... but ever so intimate and rewarding.",1146096000,5,2658,5.054919908466819
333093,5,630154028X,"At the pinnacle of his powers, Tarakovsky made this remarkable auto-biographical work, pushing cinema's powers to replicate dreams in a way that renders Surrealist 'dream' paintings redundant. Bergman, Resnais, and Bunuel had tackled the dreamworld too. But here, the commitment is ravishing. The best way to imbibe its spell is to surrender any urgency to make narrative sense, and allow the images to wash over you. This is true of all Tarakovsky, but moreso here. His familiar images, of rain, sodden earth, wood-floored interiors, sussurating meadows and leaves, red-haired women, and kids with lip herpes, are all  displayed. His aural net is on a par with the visuals; the barking dogs, Bach chorales, the squark of a beheaded chicken, sumptuous and thrilling. The prologue has a stuttering boy cured by a hypnotist and announcing (in lieu of Tarakovsky) that he will now speak clear and strong. The Kafkaesque corridors of the printworks, the family home all paint the new language that the director felt film, alone, could offer. As a vehicle for memory, dream, perception and the blurred edges they inhabit, this confessional film is close to describing how consciousness flickers in and out of control and focus. Key images, even those supplied by old newsreels, establish chronolgical footholds. Note the slightly askew sound and image tracking used sparingly, the minutely slowed down feeling of some passages. Tarakovsky's father occasionally reads his poetry over the film, adding tonal tension. In fact he is more present through voiceover than his embodied character in the film. His mother is present, at times tantalizingly so. Yet she remains withdrawn from the son, which may account for the love Tarakovsky subsequently projected with such intense palpability on the textures of the world. Watch this over and again. These textures and vivid images do not dilute.",1125446400,8,1884,5.259136212624584
333104,5,630154028X,"I've watched my VHS copy of 'Mirror' around ten times and thought I 'knew' the film well enough. But the DVD is a revelation. The different film stocks and treatments -- washed-out colour, sepia, black & white, newsreel -- and Tarkovsky's pared-down images come through crisper than ever.

The sound is the real bonus, though. 'Mirror' mightn't have been recorded in 5:1 surround, but the new audio track reveals a side of the film I didn't even know existed: a deep, almost physiological soundtrack of eerie music and painstakingly placed effects that heightens the oneiric atmosphere by several notches and which was totally lost on VHS. I know there was cross-pollination of ideas between Tarkovsky and Kubrick, and aurally 'Mirror' now appears as a more subtle, subliminal version of '2001'. Unfortunately the closing (opening!) chorus from Bach's St John Passion still sounds distorted; but even that has its charm.

So I now have even greater admiration for what was already the finest film ever made about childhood and memory. Tarkovsky plays and plays on a handful of heart-stoppingly beautiful images, the sort we all have from our earliest youth -- luminous, sublime, terrifying, warming, sad -- the ones we can neither let go of nor fathom. The sense of desperately clinging to something that has lost all meaning is also brilliantly transferred into a series of acerbic, yet necessarily (for the time) oblique political comments. It is probably the most aesthetic film I have ever seen, in the sense of pure consciousness delighting in itself. (Do I pass the Tarkovsky-Fan Waffle Test?)

The only minor quibble is the new translation, which was done by a Russian, seemingly with a Russian-English dictionary. I'm sure it's faithful to the original, but it is sometimes grammatically obtuse and frequently unidiomatic. I don't know why they couldn't reuse the translation on the VHS version. It may be more serious a problem for those who don't already know 'Mirror', but please don't let it put you off one of the most profound artistic experiences you could have on film or elsewhere.",1122076800,7,2098,5.057803468208093

In first place, we have the presence of his father the poet Arseni Tarkovsky supporting stunning visual episodes, specially the unforgettable sequence of the Spanish Civil War; second the magnificent camera work , underlining slender passages of his childhood and showing the fantastic landscapes of his homeland; third the allusive first shots of a man who has lost the essential perspectives; fourth the shocking and hallucinating sequence of a boy making piss in a art book, trying to erase the traditionalism understood as the memory's imposing; five the mirror is a journey inside oneself , a lovable cite to Cocteau's Orpheus in search of our forgotten ancestors. Somehow this film anticipates Bergman's fanny and Alexander, but with a very huge difference; Tarkovsky expresses himself poetically, instead of Bergman who subordinates the image as the final product of his will, lacking poetry.",1119484800,3,1060,5.241176470588235
333106,2,630154028X,"Let me get this straight first: This movie is awsome, I'd give it the most perfect score any day (though it defies being judged).

The ""Mirror"" by Tarkovsky is a perfect mood piece. A reflection on childhood without equal in cinema. A literal mirror which reflects and builds upon what every viewer, every individual brings with him/her to this movie. Any further comments are pointless, although I should warn that this is not a movie based on plot/ characters but on the viewer's experiance and emotions. It is also slow based and meditative: it's not a film which which feeds information to the viewer, but from which the viewer extrapolates information. Be prepared to think, or most importantly have an open heart and mind to enjoy this film.

Here's the bad: The Ruscico transfer, which is way better than the Kino release, is flawed on the NTSC (US/ Canada) versions of the film. It had been cheaply and directly ported fom a PAL (European) master of the film. Pal is 25 frames per second and NTSC is 30 frames per second. To make up for the lost 5 frames per second, a compilation od two frames blurred together was used. Hence, when the picture is moving in a panning shot, the objects on screen go out of focus...and that's unacceptable in a film like Mirror. If you want the best DVD of this movie, get the PAL version directly from Ruscico, or the ""Artificial Eye"" UK release (from Amazon UK). And make sure to note that you want the optional original mono soundtrack, since not all discs have that. You'll need a multi-system DVD player to play the dics though.

Anyways, Shame shame Ruscico for being cheap on the NTSC treatment.",1116633600,32,1643,4.639175257731959
333107,5,630154028X,"Mirror (rus., Zerkalo, 1975), is unquestionably the masterpiece of Andrei Tarkovsky's opus. It is an autobiographical film, with a rather unconventional timeline. Its structure is somewhat convoluted, making it relatively inaccessible on first viewing. Fortunately, the beauty of its images and its lyricism carry you along, and most certainly compel you to a second viewing, and then you are ""hooked."" At least, this was my experience with this film.

Mirror represents the recollections of a dying man, weighing the episodes of his life in his conscience. It is also autobiographical reflection of the author on the final stretch of the race toward the finish line of his life. His thoughts ebb and flow, as he contemplates his life's journey.

What kind of mirror is it?  It's the author's broken mirror, whose shards have been re-assembled and glued in a random fashion, with each piece reflecting an aspect of his soul. Tarkovsky's mind wanders as he recounts some of the events of his past at least the way he remembers them. The memories are set against a Russian historical backdrop from the early Stalin years to the early 70s. Tarkovsky weaves newsreels, poems, and dramatic scenes to suggest his symbolic inner world; his relationships with his mother, his ex-wife, and his son, and with the world in which he has lived.

The film, based on Tarkovsky's own screenplay. Some press interviews and writings of Tarkovsky leave no doubt that all of these events are true recollections concerning his family, his life as he has lived it and felt it. All the episodes are really part of his family history, except for one, and he undertook to literally replicate what was fixed in his memory. The only fictional episode is the illness of the narrator, which is intended to convey the author's spiritual crisis. As such, this fictional contrivance is a foundation for all of the others, utterly true remembrances.

The pace of the film is slow. As in most of Tarkovsky's other films, we see long shots, which lead to lengthy contemplations on the viewer's part, requiring the absorption of a considerable amount of fine visual details. This in turn leads the viewer into an emotional involvement with the characters. By using long shots and few cuts in his films, Tarkovsky gives the viewers a sense of time passing, and the relationship of one moment to another, as opposed to the speedy jump-cut, Hollywood style. Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called ""sculpting in time,"" which was, using the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium, to take one's experience of time and alter it. This film is the best example of the application of his theory.

Not only does Tarkovsky ""sculpt in time"" by manipulating events in an apparent random-time fashion, he also manipulates time within a particular event by using mirrors, which reflects different times, past or future, which are not of that event. There are many such examples throughout the film.

The beauty and lyricism of the images are due to Tarkovsky's unmistakable poetic style. The childhood memories, hypnotic in their intensity, are the most visually stunning filmmaking imaginable. These dream-like sequences are also the most enigmatic moments of the film, which most likely accounts for the film's alleged impenetrability.

Mirror is about the lives of the most important figures in Tarkovsky's life: his mother and his wife (interestingly, played by the same actress). From Tarkovsky's own admission, his father had no inner influence on him. His mother was the most important person in his life so much so that, for Tarkovsky, there was no question that she had to appear in person in several scenes.

Although Tarkovsky never made an explicitly political film, the relationship of the individual to history was central to his world view. In terms of a person's spiritual experience, what happened to that person yesterday may be as significant as what happened to humanity a hundred years ago. From that point of view, the film is about the nature of Russia as a mediator between the East and the West, as portrayed in the scene where Ignat reads Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev (October 19, 1836), and a little later in the film, in the footage of Russian soldiers holding back a demonstration of Chinese Maoists.

Mirror is also about the Stalinist purges of the mid-to-late 1930s and World War II. Tarkovsky shows us archive footage of contemporary events with complete detachment in contrast with the extreme intimacy of the memories. It is expressed, for example, by the apparently strange inclusion of the documentary footage of the Soviet army crossing the Sivash marshes. The poem by his father, Arseni Tarkovsky, which accompanies the Sivah crossing, is particularly telling.

To summarize this beautiful and unusual film, I will quote the author himself (upon leaving the screening of Mirror), ""When I left the cinema I was thinking that here was a film made as a poem, that it was - a cinematic impossibility it would seem - an intimate lyrical monologue.""",1104624000,6,5052,5.02389486260454
333108,5,630154028X,"I admit that I was not properly prepared when I first watched ""The Mirror"" (or ""Mirror"" or ""The Looking Glass"" or whatever it's really supposed to be called.)  It was not my first Tarkovsky movie, but I found it disjointed, confusing, incohesive, etc.  I even thought of turning it off in the middle and giving up on it.  But as I thought about it the next day, the meanings and symbols slowly became clear.  What was confusion and exasperation the night before turned into intrigue and curiosity the next day.  I actually watched the entire movie again the next night.  What I discovered was a beautifully and poetically created masterpiece that discards the narrative structure in place of disjointed memories and images.  The film is more like a painting in that to understand it each portion of the canvass must be mulled over and revisited to get the true impact.
The images in this film are absolutely stunning and unforgetable; the burning barn, milk dripping from an overturned glass...
It may go without saying but this film is for those interested in film as art and not film as blockbuster entertainment.  In fact, I'm sure that if this film were shown even in an art house half of the audience would get up and walk out.",1081814400,6,1232,4.671296296296297

333110,5,630154028X,"Be sure to read Vlad's review of the shoddy quality of this DVD.  As a non-Russian speaker, I am essentially spared the awful knowledge of just what has been done to this film.
At first viewing, unless you are an incredibly perspicacious viewer, this movie will be utterly baffling, partly because Tarkovsky has gone to such lengths to blur past and present.  The same actress plays the protagonist's ex-wife in the present and mother in the past and the same actor plays the protagonist's son in the present and himself in the past. Sometimes the present is in color, the past in black & white; having established this expectation, Tarkovsky then reverses it on you later.  Yet other times, dreams are in color and reality is in that tantalizing shade of sepia-color-black & white that Tarkovsky has used elsewhere (especially in ""Stalker"").
In fact, I was so baffled when I first saw the film that I simply gave up trying to follow the narrative and basked in the intense beauty of the film work.  The dream sequence of the mother washing her hair, for instance, is utterly mesmerizing. The long shot that carries us from a table out to witness a burning building is breathtaking in all of the various reflections and reversals of angles it uses along the way.  The final shot of an old women and two children walking into a field as the camera pulls slowly into deeper and deeper woods until finally the people are completely concealed by the trees often chokes me up, and I couldn't tell you why.  Even the opening scene, simply a conversation on a fence by a field, is an exquisitely choreographed ballet of cinematography.
This most personal of Tarkovsky's intensely personal body of work is essentially biographical, but no self-respecting member of the Russian intelligentsia, at least not one of Tarkovsky's disposition, could ever justify such a self-indulgence as mere biography. Consequently, we never see the protagonist, save for his hand when he is ill and overhearing his voice. This erasure of his adult self, and the inclusion of newsreel footage of key historical moments during the protagonist's life, aim at creating a generalized biography for all of Russia.  An especially striking moment shows news footage of Russian soldiers slogging muddily through a bog.  As soon as one has the full impression that this is human life in a thoroughly degraded condition, a voiceover of one of Tarkovsky's father's poems talks of immortality, sublime beauty, the very loftiest of human sentiments on spirituality.  The contrast is deliberate, but not ironic, and illustrates a triumph of the human spirit in even the most unlikely of places and times.  Elsewhere, Tarkovsky makes a religion of elevating the mundane.  In his book on his work, he admits that one of his techniques (he denies there is anything symbolic in his work) is to focus on an object for so long that the viewer inevitably begins to wonder at, and thereby increase the significance of it.
Perhaps if the subtitles were better, I'd better understand the film.  As it is, the sheer intensity of the films gorgeousness never ceases to amaze me.  The dream sequences alone are simply amazing. There have been other movies that might here or there exceed the Mirror in beauty for a moment or two (""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" comes to mind), but I've never found one that can even come close to matching its consistency throughout.  This is without question, the most visually moving film I have ever seen.",1042934400,40,3480,4.876271186440678

For those of you who don't speak Russian, I feel very very very bad for you, because of the terrible translation of the movie.  Aside from the poems in the movie, that were previously translated by the professionals, the translation sounds as though it was done by fifth-graders.  And not just because it is done in the high-school level English.  HALF of the speech is not translated at all--a lot of important chatter is completely missing in the subtitles.  Many things are oversimplified and revealed, instead of letting the viewer dig them out him/herself.  Those of you who don't understand Russian are doomed to be tortured by such translation and never to reveal the true beauty and meaning of the original script.  Having read all of the subtitles, I understood a lot of things in a wrong way, different from the way they were intended in the first place, and had zero satisfaction from the movie.  Thank [deity] I'm Russian.
The ugly yellow subtitles can NOT be removed--they will stay on the screen forever while I watch the movie and irritate and upset me with the abovementioned crimes against Art.
The supposedly ""black and white"" scenes, which originally had a silver-ish quality to them, and some were in sepia, are now in plain B&W a la Fellini's La Strada.  I used to have a feeling that the bushes were made out of steel and silver, but not on this DVD.
DVD has ZERO extras, and thank [deity] they divided the movie into chapters for easy scene access, but even there they managed to screw up.  Upon skipping to a chapter, the scenes do not start from the beginning, and you actually skip halfway into the characters' speech.
For Tarkovsky movies, I would NORMALLY recommend R.U.S.C.I.C.O. editions, but not in the case of Mirror.  Yes, as any R.U.S.C.I.C.O. movie, it has very good subtitles, in a dozen languages.  But, the problems with the picture and sound are even worse in their edition, albeit better picture quality as opposed to the grainy KINO quality.  R.U.S.C.I.C.O. tried extremely hard to make the movie more enjoyable, and, apparently, overdid it.  The lighting does not match with the original movie, as they try to make every object more distinctly seen and illuminated.  They increase sharpness in places where it shouldn't take place, such as ""hand-on-fire"" image, thus depriving the illusion that the hand is on fire.  Remastered sound often fails too, as many sounds are louder than others and overlap each other out of order.
But I digress.  We have no other choice but to choose between either KINO or R.U.S.C.I.C.O. edition of Mirror.  I suggest buying both :) so that you could experience the near-proper picture quality of KINO and the proper translation of R.U.S.C.I.C.O.",1035676800,210,2924,4.816

333134,4,630154028X,"As with all work by the great Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, ""The Mirror"" is an enigmatic, not quite describable film composed of finely honed imagery and evocative sounds that combine to produce an experience both delicate and overpowering at the same time. Tarkovsky's is among the most personal of personal filmmaking, in which each film seems a quest to re-invent the cinema over and over again. Rooted in the rhythms and routines of the everyday, his films are nonetheless the opposite of banal, finding in a glass of spilled milk or the movement of the wind through the trees an exquisite opening on to the transcendent.
For such an uncompromising, original artist, every film is in a sense autobiographical, a record of his thoughts and feelings at the moment of filming. Yet in this, Tarkovsky's most explicitly autobiographical film (it is based on his childhood experiences during World War II), the results are relatively unsatisfying. There are still breathtakingly beautiful images, arresting sequences of inexplicable power, the same singular vision. What is surprising is how *fashionable* ""The Mirror"" is, and as a result, how dated. Made in the early 1970s, ""The Mirror"" indulges in many late 60s/early 70s mannerisms, including a non-linear narrative, stream-of-consciousness editing, dreams to explain the irrational and the use of newsreel footage as a kind of collective memory.
While masterfully employed, these techniques are not really worthy of a director who has proven repeatedly his ability to move beyond fashion and create his own standards. Dependent on editing, these devices are also just a tad removed from Tarkovsky's basic skills. His best work flows with the coursing sparkle of the streams and puddles he loves to film. There are times in the ""The Mirror,"" on the other hand, when the cuts from one shot or scene to another are more forced than flowing, a touch too disconnected to compel as anything other than filmmaking necessity.
""The Mirror"" is nonetheless vividly textured, with an almost voracious response to light, shade and materials. (I have never seen a more effective use of the *grain* of film stock to enhance the tactile qualities of the image.) Like ""Solaris,"" it makes a good introduction to Tarkovksy's work for viewers who might be a little put off by his more uncompromising efforts. Which is to say that in addition to dating the film, ""The Mirror's"" stylishness works to smooth over some of the director's rough edges. Viewers already familiar with Tarkovsky's cinema will not be seriously disappointed, perhaps just a little surprised, as I was, that he too could succumb to the momentarily fashionable.",1007510400,12,2670,5.168591224018476

Indeed, few works of art say more about the Russian  people with such economy.
The cinematography, by Georgii Rerberg, is so  richly detailed that it frequently takes your breath away. Many of the  shots are deliberately reminiscent of paintings by Breughel and Leonardo da  Vinci. The soundtrack is equally beautiful, layered with natural sounds,  electronic music, classical music (by composers such as Bach and Pergolesi)  and poems (written and recited by the director's father Arsenii Tarkovsky,  a noted Russian poet).
The film undoubtedly benefits from its superb  cast, which includes many popular and highly respected Russian actors. The  voice of the Narrator is played by Innokenty Smoktunovsky; Margarita  Terekhova plays both the Mother and the Wife. Other actors make indelible  impressions in smaller roles: Anatoly Solonitsyn (the Doctor),  Oleg  Yankovsky (the Father), Alla Demidova and Nikolai Grinko (the mother's  colleagues at the printing factory). For those who speak Russian, it's a  pleasure just to hear their finely tuned dialogue.
Although the film was  widely criticized for being too difficult to follow, it was also praised by  many Russian critics for capturing the spirit of an entire generation. It  may not be to the taste of everyone, since it is constructed more like a  poem than a conventional film narrative. However, for those who are willing  to make the leap of faith, it is uniquely rewarding.
Kino on Video's new  DVD looks absolutely stunning. Having seen the film a number of times in  various less-than-ideal incarnations on video, I was impressed at the way  the DVD captures the richness of the film's cinemtography. The film is  above all a sensuous experience, so every extra bit of detail in the image  and sound helps add to its overall emotional impact. Kino has used the same  transfer for their new VHS edition, but the DVD is clearly preferable and  it's the same price. It doesn't have any special features, unlike Kino's  new release of Tarkovky's THE SACRIFICE, which includes a making-of  documentary. However, it's hard to complain when the film itself and the  video transfer are so satisfying. In summation, I can hardly recommend this  particular title more highly.",952819200,69,2832,5.172185430463577
7812329,5,630154028X,"This is an excellent copy, worthy of any Tarkovsky fan.  The video quality is good (maybe not criterion collection pristine, but still very good).  The movie starts playing immediately, rather than defaulting to the DVD menu like most DVDs, but audio and subtitle tracks can be rotated through using the ""Audio"" and ""Subtitle"" buttons on most remotes.

The audio defaults to a 2.1 (stereo plus subwoofer) track, but can be toggled to the original mono track.  There are a myriad of subtitle languages, and from what I can tell (at least with the English subtitles) the RUSCICO edition translation was very thorough (and not missing large chunks of the dialogue, as with another release of this movie) albeit a little hard to follow in the poetry sections because of how fast the lines of text have to change out to keep up with the poetry.

This release is a Region 9 (all region compatible) NTSC DVD, making it universally acceptable for anyone with a NTSC-compatible DVD player.

Notable difference from the product image:  the cover of the copy I received says ""Mirror"" with the Russian directly beneath it, not ""The Mirror"" by itself.  Otherwise, the DVD cover is the same as shown.  See photo.",1520121600,,1198,4.833333333333333
7812330,3,630154028X,"The only things I appreciate about this film are the interesting and sometimes beautiful images, which are worthy of being shown in a Museum Of Photographic Arts.
Otherwise, what I hear is a narrator reciting a senseless poem, dialogue consisting largely of criticism and blame, and dialogue containing pronouns without antecedent nouns, so that the pronouns lack referents and don't communicate.  I see numerous images of rain and of fire, but I haven't the slightest idea what they mean.  The narrative, if one can call it that, is not in temporal sequence and is chopped into short scenes that are shuffled, with much extraneous material spliced in at random.  I found no emotional connection to the story or characters, most of whom are nameless.  A possible hypothesis is that an egocentric auteur makes a film like this to feel superior to his audience, who find the film incomprehensible.  Another possible hypothesis is that the auteur is engaging in self-indulgence.",1519516800,,975,5.1069182389937104
