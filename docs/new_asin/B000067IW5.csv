7963063,4,B000067IW5,"In Old Caliente, 1939 film

The early days of California attracted settlers, fortune hunters, and outlaws to threaten the established order. The story begins with two riders watching covered wagons in the distance. Gabby provides background information. There is a song by cowboys after a cattle drive to bring beef to miners. A gang of robbers plan a highway robbery. They grab bags of specie, cold cash. [Note the anachronism of cartridge pistols in the 1850s.] Don Vargas fears the new immigrants will affect their quality of life. These immigrants speak of their legal rights as citizens. There is conflict until the Don arrives, and breaks with Roy. The settlers camp near the ocean, there is another song. An earthquake? Welcome to California. Roy and Gabby see the foreman in an unusual place. Gabby's dog doesn't like this man. Roy and Gabby capture the gang, but Sujarto acts to free them. The gang chases Roy, but the Don's men catch them. Sujarto places the blame on Roy and Gabby. [No explanation given?]

The ""general"" returns to the settlers. Gabby's niece Jean asks to see him, and asks Don Vargas if he asked for an explanation. The guests hear two shots and go to the wine vault. Roy and Gabby are blamed, but escape with the help of Rita, Don Vargas' daughter. A wanted poster lists 5,000 pesos reward for Roy. [Gold and silver specie have intrinsic value.] Carlos finds Roy in the hidden cave. Roy convinces Carlos of his innocence. They plan a trap to catch the outlaws. They sell a herd of cattle but take payment in a cannonball-sized gold ingot! The outlaws attack the good guys retreat. How will they divide this loot? Roy, Carlos, and more than a dozen men attack the outlaws who lug their gold ball. There is a shoot-out and a chase for action. A fight in the surf leaves one man standing. Roy leaves the Vargas ranch. Will there be a happy ending for Roy and Jean?

This western takes place in 1850s southern California. It involves saving a big ranch from robbers who steal gold, not the cattle that were sold. It has a trusted foreman who is in cahoots with these robbers. Don Vargas must have poor judgment in trusting Sujarto (or there is some hidden relationship). Jack La Rue played as a villain in many films. This average story uses a background that is educational.",1424995200,,2301,4.676543209876543
7963064,5,B000067IW5,"In Roy Rogers lore there is BEFORE King of the Cowboys and AFTER King of the Cowboys. Any western buff knows that after his debute in Under Western Stars,a film made for Gene Autry but who was ""on strike"" against Republic Pictures, Rogers was retained but demoted to ""straight"" westerns.i.e., no musical against fiesta, parade, rodeo, or stage-like settings, no fancy shirts, no silver saddle for Trigger, no ""modern"" setting or plot, no Sons of the Pioneers or ""hit songs"" When Autry went into the Air Force in '41, Republic produced ""King of the Cowboys"" with Roy Rogers. The Autry format of modern plot with production musical numbers was simply transferred to Rogers. Dale Evans and Trigger, Smartest Horse in the M ovies, were quick to follow. But IN OLD CALIENTE, made in 1939, we have an exception. I never saw this film as a kid, but on a DVD Rogers collection. I had to double check its date, even with Lynn Roberts as the heroine which would place it in the late 30s or 1940. Not only does it have all the production qualities( genuine Calfornia hacienda, sea shore scenes, good songs with setting, silver saddles,... all the musical western promo associated with Gene Autry's great hit SOUTH OF THE BORDER .In Old Caliente is a genuine mid 1940s musical western with a So California/Spanish flavor. Even without the Sons of the Pioneers, its musical numbers are among Rogers' best. The straight western COLORADO is also an exception to the second banana role cast for Rogers at 1930s Republic, co starring Milburn Stone, its better than any Gene Autry movie except for South of the Border",1336521600,,1599,4.776173285198556
