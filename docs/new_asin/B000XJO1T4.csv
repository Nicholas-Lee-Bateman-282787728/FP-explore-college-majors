8228677,3,B000XJO1T4,Part 1 box started about half way through the season.  The discs were numbered and still had the wrong episodes on them.  I'm not sure that I even got all the episodes and I bought parts 1 and 2.,1492041600,,195,3.9743589743589745

8228682,5,B000XJO1T4,"Season 1 part 2 is great.  It picks up where part 1 left off.  But, these videos are different than other videos I have seen which may cause you to think there are problems with sequencing.  The videos immediately start over when finished which makes them run in a ""continuous loop"".  This may be confusing if you're not paying attention.  It makes you think it's sequenced wrong and you're watching something you've already seen.  But the sequencing is correct and plays properly to the end (then it starts over).  If you notice where it ends, it's perfectly normal.  I found no serious problems and would buy it again.",1401926400,,620,4.675925925925926
8228683,1,B000XJO1T4,"I bought these and all the other American Hot Rod DVDs to replace the video tapes I used to make as the show was airing. I had watched all the episodes a couple of times before and it was a good long while before I attempted to play these, the season 1 and 3, parts 1 and 2 DVDs all played perfectly but these DVDs are a mess. Here is a listing of the actual contents of the DVDs I received:

Season 2 Part 1 Disc 1
1. '40 Woody Part 2
2. '40 Woody Part 3 Finale

Season 2 Part 1 Disc 2
1. '63 Corvette Part 1
2. '63 Corvette Part 2

Season 2 Part 1 Disc 3
1. '63 Corvette Part 3 (Finale)
2. Crazyhorse '65 Mustang (Finale)

Season 2 Part 2 Disc 1 DISC DEFECTIVE, WILL ONLY PLAY IN A COMPUTER
1. Crazyhorse '65 Mustang (Finale Again)
2. Rat Rod Build Off Part 1

Season 2 Part 2 Disc 2
1. Rat Rod Build Off Part 2
2. Rat Rod Build Off Part 3

Season 2 Part 2 Disc 3
1. Rat Rod Build Off Part 4
2. '40 Woody Part 1

After waiting too long to watch these I was unable to even contact anyone about the problem so I leave this review as a warning to others.",1276300800,7,1053,3.695067264573991
8228684,2,B000XJO1T4,"One of the discs don't work, and the episodes on the disc don't ""match"" with the actual ones. No menus on it or anything. Cant say i would recommend it to others, since it seems like they have just taken the whole season devided it into 1hr 45 min ""clips"" and burned it on a dvd.",1204761600,6,279,4.0
8228685,1,B000XJO1T4,"This is perhaps the worst DVD set I've ever owned.  It is composed in no particular sequence - as already outlined in a previous review it starts (Disk 1 part 1) half way through a build and half way through the season.  Then you have to hunt through the remaining 5 DVD's to find the rest of the episodes.  There is no idexing, DVD extras or any other features.  If I had taped the show from the original broadcast and simply burnt it randomly on to DVD's I would have come up with the same product.  Discovery's first season release was also terrible as you have to purchase each episode one at a time, but at least you could figure out the logic to the composition.

Overall - the worst DVD ""set"" ever - way to go discovery.",1200182400,7,727,4.231884057971015
