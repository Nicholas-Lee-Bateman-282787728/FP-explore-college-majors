8197470,3,B000QUEQIG,"When I saw this I got excited thinking all the Christmas classics my parents showed me when I was little were collected onto one DVD. While this DVD has a lot of the goodies:

~ Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer - On Christmas eve, Rudolph is visited by Santa and recruited to lead his sleigh through the thick fog (this story is pretty self-explanatory)
~ Christmas Comes But Once a Year - an orphanage of children get a surprise visit from a jolly man who dresses up as Santa and creates toys out of ordinary household items
~ Hector's Hectic Life - Hector the dog finds a picnic basket on his front porch and 3 puppies that coincidentally look like him pop out and wreak havoc in Hector's home. Hector tries to hide the pups from his elderly master at the risk of being thrown out of the house, himself
~ Snow-Foolin' - This cartoon begins with a bunch of animals coping with winter weather and transitions into a ""Jingle Bells"" sing-a-long
~ Jack Frost - A young bear cub thinks he's a mature grizzly and can take on anything, until old man winter decides to bully the little bear. Jack Frost appears to help the young cub get back home.

Other episodes are included too, which I had never seen before. This DVD is missing one cartoon, however. I can't remember what it's called but there's a cartoon where children from all over the globe stowaway in Santa's sleigh. When he returns to the North Pole, the children clean Santa's house and make him a special present. I know there's another DVD that has this cartoon (search for ""Christmas Classics"") and I wish I found that DVD before purchasing this one.",1262304000,,1607,4.518900343642612
