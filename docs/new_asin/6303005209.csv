In ""Stacey's Big Break"", The BSC is putting on a play for everyone.  They are doing ""Snow White"" and Stacey gets Charlotte to play the lead.  But only if she, Stacey will help her.  Then one day after baby-sitting her ""little sister"", Stacey discovered by a modeling agency and is asked to model their products.  Everything is going fine until Stacey starts to mix up her priorities and gets stressed.  She wants to be a model, but she also wants to be with her friends and help Charlotte.  Will Stacey make the right choice?
This movie is really heart warming and very family oriented.  I like Stacey and Charlotte's friendship.  It's really sweet.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the books. It's GREAT!!!

The BSC Movie (released in 1995) was okay, but the casting did not even come close to that from these primary videos. The casting of the 7 leading girls is PERFECT, especially Avriel Hillman as Kristy Thomas, the leader of the pack. She seems also custom made for this character. This, to me, is the major strength to these tapes. The shows have a little bit of a cheesy edge to them, but if you love the books and the characters, it's plenty of fun. I would definitely recommend them for the accuracy of the casting and the enjoyable storylines for kids and all fans. And if you like these, I also recommend the Ramona videos, which also do a wonderful job of making their corresponding books go even further.",1059091200,5,938,4.365714285714286
7835143,5,6303005209,"This is one of my favorite BSC videos in the series. It focuses on Stacey's once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a bigtime model and her struggles to find her priorities. She wants to be a model, but she also misses her friends and all the kids she babysits for, especially little Charlotte. It's a good video with a good message. They're good videos to use to teach little kids about friendship. The actors do indeed bring the book characters to life, and they do a great job at it.",1022457600,6,487,4.545454545454546
