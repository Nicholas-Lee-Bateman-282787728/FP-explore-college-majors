3853895,1,B0026IQTO0,"What a disappointment.

This movie sets out to tell a story of ""forgiveness and redemption"" (according to the extras).  It does neither.  How sad to get into a story that's afraid, or does not know how, to resolve what has been set up.  I love Westerns but this tedious, overlong, and way too talky dud is firing blanks.

This film purports to be about spirituality.  In fact, it has the trappings of a ""Christian production.""  But sadly, it is without a soul.  Or commercial prospects.  I'm glad I saw it for free.  I wonder, just who is the intended audience?  I can't imagine.

There's a powerful story in the premise.  But I guess no one involved in the production actually experienced forgiveness or redemption.  Hollywood can do that to a person.  I know.",1247443200,8,761,4.616541353383458

3853902,5,B0026IQTO0,"I find this movie to be very well crafted, with good photography, story, and acting.

Technical Details: Widescreen, Dolby Surround 5.1, R rated for violence (there is no nudity), with English subtitles available (for hearing impaired). The only extras are a short ""behind the scenes"" and the trailer.

This movie is about a man who returns to his small town in New Mexico to find revenge for his father's murder. It is set in the period just before and after the Civil War. The story is somewhat dark, as is perhaps appropriate for a movie called ""Shadowheart"". Westerns have traditionally been about good and evil (and good always wins), but this one is a more modern theme - it could have been set in any age or time. The fact that it works very well in this period piece is a testament to the writer and directors. The writers manage to give a good experience of how the west actually was, rather than succumbing to Hollywood stereotypes. The movie has a lot of depth because of the script.

There are no bad actors in this film, which is nice to see in an independent production. I think that the best character was the villain; he was thoroughly evil, and yet was also pitiful. One got the impression that he was evil but at the same time tired of life. The acting for this character was really great. The lead character was also quite good, showing the conflicts he felt about his mission of revenge versus his inner feelings that he had simply seen too much violence. The other characters were well acted, but did not have as much script material to work with.

Photography is focused on the action, and in general very well done. They do not use screen time on expansive scenery, which is done a lot in westerns (but would have detracted from the dark plot). I thought the filming supported the movie well.

The only negative in the entire movie was that I felt the Native American involvement did not quite come through as well as I would have liked. There was not enough time in the script to develop their characters, and I found their actions in helping the main character to be a bit, well, sudden.

Summary: A bit depressing, but a very thoughtful movie. It is worth watching, even if you don't like westerns. Highly recommended.",1368057600,,2244,4.555831265508685

3853904,2,B0026IQTO0,"SHADOWHEART is a Western that contains just about every cliche you could imagine from a Western...all of it delivered clumsily and with almost no new spin.  Westerns are by their nature formulaic...they are a genre that hews closely to established turns.  That's why they have often struggled in modern times...it's rare they find an embracing audience because they often feel tired and uninspired, unless crafted with real skill and fervency (I'm thinking of UNFORGIVEN or the 3:10 TO YUMA remake).  This Western, based on a story by its star Justin Ament suffers from a low budget which did not allow the money to hire skillful lead actors, craft a good script or even provide for technical technique that ever rises above mid-level TV movie quality.

As a young boy, James Cooper's preacher father is killed by town trouble maker Will Tunney...so James flees his New Mexico  home to head east.  He leaves behind his best friend, a young girl named Mary as well as his shame at not having the nerve to kill the man who murdered his beloved father.  Year later, James returns to his old town a Civil War He arrests veteran who has been hardened by his work as a bounty hunter.  He finds that Will is now mayor and a major landowner, but still a vicious killer.  Things don't work out as easily as James would like, and the movie takes many predictable turns.  Although the body count of ""good"" guys is higher than normal).  It even echoes DANCES WITH WOLVES at times.

While little in the film is new, a well done Western can still be engrossing.  Simple passions and clear boundaries between good and evil can make the films satisfying and emotional.  But SHADOWHEART suffers because its lead ""good"" guy (Ament) is not only bland, but downright bad.  He rarely musters up any convincing emotions (and his efforts are not helped by a corny soundtrack that contains a couple of songs so bad as to be laughable).  And as Will Tunney, character actor Angus Macfadyen might just as well be twirling a mustache and typing folks to railroad tracks.  We hate him mostly because he's so unconvincing.

The film, set in New Mexico but filmed in California, looks nice and that's virtually its only redeeming quality.  It is violent, but most of the violence is not terribly graphic, which I suppose might make this a good movie for an older audience that yearns for the days of films with no bad language, nudity or overt sexuality or violence.  That's not a knock on that kind of film or audience member.  SHADOWHEART is one of those movies that was probably a labor of love from Ament and director Deann Alioto (who also co-wrote the screenplay and takes on a major supporting role).  I'm not sure how they got the supposed budget of $10,000,000...but I'm guessing they were disappointed with the returns on the investment.

I almost hate to criticize this film, because it feels a little like yelling at a group of youth league football players for not being able to beat a college team.  It feels like a movie made by folks eagerly trying to break into the big leagues, even though they don't have the skills.  But when there are so many better entertainments out there that deserve your attention, I must try to steer you away from spending 114 minutes on SHADOWHEART.",1319241600,,3265,4.685964912280702
3853905,3,B0026IQTO0,"Shadowheart came out in 2009 and was set in the years of the civil war. Despite its intro scene which features a Navaho dancer, and the marketing push which states that there's a lot of Native American aspects to the movie, it is primarily about a white couple. We begin with the boy and girl in love in the town of Legend, New Mexico. The music seems almost lifted directly from Lord of the Rings scenes of the Shire. After the boy's father is slain he runs off, experiences the horrors of war, then returns home to make things right. Much of the movie is fairly stereotypical complete with slick-back-hair bad guy and his sneaky sidekick.

The funniest part of the entire movie has to be the existence of Vampire People in Legend. I watched this movie twice, two years apart, and each time I burst out laughing when I saw their evidence. But we'll get to that in a minute.

The movie promotes heavily its native American layers - and indeed the title Shadowheart refers to how dark the hero feels. However, there are only random glimpses of native Americans here. First, as Shadowheart is bounty hunting after his civil war stint, he runs into a small group of Navaho who have been rousted from their home in Tsegi, Arizona and are being brought to live on a reservation. He gives a knife to two of them so they can escape. This brother and sister pair are played by Michael Spears and Tonantzin Carmelo. Michael is Sioux. He played ""Otter"" in Dances with Wolves. Tonantzin is half Tongva / Kumeyaay - tribes of southern California. The movie was filmed in California, too. Maybe I'm too picky, but it always bothers me when they film something that is all about a ""place"" with certain ""people"" and then neither are accurate.

Back to the story. There is of course conflict between the good guys and bad guys, and the two Navajo have to come in and help out. I won't give away any spoilers, but the movie is certainly not focused on the native American aspect of things, which the rest of the marketing might lead one to believe. It's primarily an Old West love / revenge story.

Now, as to the Vampire People. Or maybe they're zombies. In any case, they are some sort of people who don't age at all despite the passage of ten years. At the beginning of the film, the main lovers are maybe 11 or 12. Young love. As they first get into the town of Legend, a very distinctive pair of women are walking on the street with giant parasols. One parasol is white, the other black. It's hard to miss them. A guy to the left lounges in a fringed shirt with white pants.

Then we fast forward to when Shadowheart returns to town after his years of civil war grief and bounty hunting. He strolls back into his home town for the first time in a decade or more. Look! It is the EXACT SAME PEOPLE in the exact same positions standing in the street! What, is this where they stand all the time, waiting for him to see them? They haven't aged a day, they haven't changed their clothes, they are maintaining the same relative position to each other.

Spoooooky.

In any case, watching this once was not overly exciting, and watching it a second time just reminded me of the silliness from the first time. The saving grace is that I loved the characters of the surveyors. They were minor characters, but so well done. They really came to life. It made me realize as an author that this was something to aim for, to give even minor characters this kind of vitality.",1317427200,,3448,4.437598736176935
3853906,2,B0026IQTO0,This movie was billed as best western since tombstone. IT was a far cry from being anywheres close as good as tombstone. At best it was ok as a B movie.

3853907,4,B0026IQTO0,"Although I'm not a fan of westerns I have to say that this movie is decent. It's not so much the typical plot carried out by so many other westerns. This is more of a growth and discovery of self type movie... with a western movie set. I think that's what is deceptive about it. People expect a western and are dissappointed by it.
The plot itself could work in a number of settings, which I found interesting in and of itself.
Although it is a bit slow to get started, once I realized this wasn't a typical western and changed my point of view I was pleased by how the story moved.
If you're expecting a true western then this is not the movie for you. If you are looking for an inner growth type movie then you should like this one... just realize the setting is not the usual.
All in all a decent movie. Acting, sets and music nicely done. Great plot and deceptive setting.",1296950400,,876,4.220238095238095
3853908,5,B0026IQTO0,"This movie is unlike any other western I've seen. My opinion runs contrary to the others here.

I highly recommend this movie.",1296345600,,323,5.0
3853909,2,B0026IQTO0,"Unlike many people my age (who don't quite fit into Generation X or the Millenials), I was raised watching Westerns and it is a film genre that I particularly enjoy. My parents were Baby Boomers and they made sure my siblings and I knew about Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Paladin, the Lone Ranger, and the Cisco Kid. Most of the films we watched were somewhat melodramatic with a formulaic plot that included a good dose of humor and or music. I've re-watched some of those films recently and even the most formulaic of these stories is better than the average films Hollywood now pushes out. There are certain characteristics of the genre and the reason Westerns often seem to fail nowadays is because filmmakers just don't understand the genre. Such is the case with SHADOWHEART.

SHADOWHEART is an independent, low-budget Western that revolves around the character of James Conners (Justin Ament). The opening segment of the movie shows the relationships between Conners with his best friend, Johny Cooper (the older version portrayed by Shawn Reaves), his sweetheart Mary Cooper (older version portrayed by Marnie Alton), and his father,
Thomas Conners (William Sadler). Thomas is the pastor of the small church in the town. The church building is one that he has built by his hand from the bottom up. On a summer day he is putting the finishing coats of white paint on the steeple when he is approached by Will Tunney (Angus MacFayden). Tunney is a local drunk and lowlife. However, Tunney informs Rev. Conners that last night in a game of cards he won the deed for the land the church sits on. He gives the Reverend two days to pay off the money he still owes on the deed otherwise he is evicting him. The Reverend is dismayed and Tunney shoots the man in cold blood. However, there are no witnesses to the crime and when the sheriff arrives two traveling lowlifes claim they saw the Reverend preparing to throw a hammer at Tunney. Thomas last words to James are that he forgive those who wrong him. With that, James is left an orphan and leaves behind his town and sets out for family who live in the South.

Fifteen years pass by. The Civil War has come and gone and now Tunney is a respected businessman and mayor of the town. Through murder, extortion, and other unsavory means he owns all of the land in town. When James returns home to seek out his long-lost love, Mary, he also plans on seeking revenge on Tunney. But Mary and Thomas Conner's words of forgiveness weight heavy upon James and leave him conflicted. What will he do, what will he do?

Angus MacFayden gives a wonderful performance as Will Tunney. He steals every scene he is in. Most of the other cast give decent performances, though there are some moments of blandness. That's about the only redeeming features about SHADOWHEART. The rest is a hodge-podge mix-match mess.

Let's start off with what SHADOWHEART portends to be.  The DVD cover states that the movie is an exciting Western about a man who returns to his hometown to seek revenge for his father's murder only to, ""discover a Native American world where justice has no name and vengeance rides in the shadows."" Well, there are only two Indians in most of the movie and neither one of them seems to be part of the world in which they are living. In fact, they are escapees from group of natives being moved to a reservation. When we first meet them they appear more like a line of slaves being brought to market instead of the actual groups of people that were forced to move to reservations.

Most of the dialog is quite silly and melodramatic. The actors do what they can with it, but there's only so much you can do when given pressed ham and cheese to work with.

The story is all over the map. You think the overall story is going to be about James coming home to seek his revenge, but finding redemption instead. Well, he does, but then the bad guys escape and instead of redemption, James is left wanting revenge again. Bad guys appear out of nowhere, none the more apparent than a character called Spider who seems only to exist as a deux ex a machine for the bad guys and to give the director an opportunity to act in the movie. Railroad men, who were some of the most ruthless and consistent figures in history, alter their plans for a railroad at the request of a small town land baron whom they will never see again.

Oh, and then there's the whole them of SHADOWHEART.  Is it about revenge or redemption? Well, the two are kind of related, but they are distinct things. The movie confuses the two all the time and ends with a message that you can get redemption through revenge even if it goes against everything else in the movie. James father, his girl Mary, and even the Indian woman he meets all tell him that he won't see his loved ones again if his heart if full of shadow that is tinted with bloodlust. Yet, that's exactly what he does and in the end everything turns out alright. It just doesn't fit.

I realize that my taste in movies are different from my parents. They were lovers of Westerns. So, I keep asking myself what my Dad and Mom would think of SHADOWHEART. I think they would say, ""It's okay,"" and that would be it.  That's about the highest praise this movie should receive because beyond the acting, particularly Angus MacFayden's performance, SHADOWHEART should be a movie better left in the shadows.",1296259200,,5372,4.568016614745587
3853910,5,B0026IQTO0,"This movie was very well casted and allowed the viewing audience a peak at what it was like to live during the time of the western frontier. Not only needing to be on constant alert for indians, but also fellow townspeople who surrounded themselves with an unsavory regiment of killers and men with no morals in order to take over a town and everyone in it. The quality of the DVD was excellent and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
shadow Heart touched my soul in a way no other movie has to date. This is a 5 thumbs up movie!",1288915200,2,533,4.235294117647059
3853911,4,B0026IQTO0,"The Western genre is difficult to pull off, but ""Shadowheart"" makes a valiant and worthy effort, even if the pacing is slow. But after ""Unforgiven,"" the modern Western had the bar raised as high as an elephant's eye.

Give the movie credit. It starts with that most classic and elemental hero's desire: revenge. James Conners sees his father (the wonderful actor William Sadler, who the director praises in the audio commentary), a town preacher, murdered by Will Tunney, the psychotic land baron who chews up the scenery and injects vulnerability into the role of the antagonist. Conners leaves town, returns after a stint in the Civil War, reconnects with his sweetheart Mary Cooper, and sets out to avenge his father's death, even though his father told him to leave justice to God. Unfortunately, James's anger is as blatant as the bordello-esque crimson Will has painted his father's church. Tunney must die, much to the anguish of his madam girlfriend.

""Shadowheart"" is watchable, even though it takes some tangents such as two ""noble savage"" Native American allies introduced late in the film, and Daniel Baldwin gives a creditable performance.",1283644800,,1152,5.122340425531915
3853912,3,B0026IQTO0,Nothing new with this one. Obviously little money spent here and it shows. No sprawling vistas as seen in the the classics. Some good acting but it's not sufficient for me to recommend this.,1279152000,,190,4.617647058823529
3853913,1,B0026IQTO0,"Simply put, ""Shadowheart"" is an atrocious film. Although it's not as bad as some of the other films I've seen, ""Shadowheart"" is poorly written, badly acted, and historically inaccurate.

What kept bothering me throughout the movie wasn't the fact that this Western wasn't actually set in a correct era, it was the fact that no one in this film speaks as if they were in the 19th century New Mexico. The dialogue, as well as the accent, are modern-day. The music, the sets, the costumes - everything rarely has a feel of the olden era about it.

All in all, it's almost as if someone read the Cliff Notes as to how to behave in a Western and made it into a film.

Perhaps in his first film debut, Dean Alioto shouldn't have overextended himself by trying to be a triple threat (writer-director-actor); he should've focused on one area. He needed to have concentrated more on honing his script to include character development and realistic dialogue, directing his actors, and doing something besides looking moody and mysterious as a supporting character, Spider. Alioto attempts to project his inner Sam Elliott in the film and comes up quite short.

Furthermore, it's unclear why Alioto needed 114 minutes to tell the most basic of all stories and why he needed to use every minute of film to drag out the most basic of plots. The plot begins with the murder of James Conners (Justin Ament), the preacher of the town of Legend, New Mexico. Conners runs away, fights through the Civil War, comes back to get the girl of his dreams, decides not to avenge his father's death and realizes how wrong he's been about ""turning the other cheek.""

A film that could've dealt with Conners' inner turmoil and the questions of forgiveness and religious beliefs vs reality, ""Shadownheart"" barely even hints at these themes and provided no others for the viewer to contemplate.

The only possible highlight of this film is Angus Macfadyen. Macfadyen plays Will Tunney - the film's villain - a murderer, philanderer, and a business tycoon. Tunney is a character that's a lot more promising than the purported hero of this film. However, Macfadeyen has very little to work with in terms of script and is thus unable to carry this movie.

The cover for the DVD for ""Shadowheart"" claims that this is ""The best movie since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tombstone/dp/6304711905/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tombstone</a>."" The only way that this can be the case is if the person providing such feedback (Peter Sherayko, who is a ""Western historian"" according to the DVD cover) has not seen any other Westerns since ""Tombstone."" To even draw comparisons between ""Tombstone"" and ""Shadowheart"" is to think excessively low of the former and optimistically high of the latter.

Even though I never push my opinion of a movie on others (realizing that everyone has different taste), I must recommend against watching this film.",1274313600,,2945,5.057731958762886

3853917,2,B0026IQTO0,"""He came for revenge...he found redemption"" is the tag-line for this movie. I won't spoil the film, but as far as that tag-line goes...not really.  And that is my main problem with this film.  It had no idea what it was trying to say.  It leads you in the direction of God and redemption, completely ignores it, and pays you off with...well, I can't say without putting spoilers in the review.  I'll just say, the ending should have been different, considering the actions and words of the characters.  At the same time I was afraid that this would be a movie that over preachy, and it was not.

The plot, briefly, is typical Western fare.  A preacher is killed, the son goes off and comes back years later for revenge.

Cinematically, this feels like a Halmark or Disney channel made-for-T.V. movie.  Having grown up on the films of Sergio Leone, I have a love of Westerns where you can feel the grit.  Where you can smell the stink coming off the actors on the screen.  In ""Shadowheart"", everyone has perfectly shampooed hair and bright clean clothes.  Even after a fight, characters have perfectly and artistically applied dirt and blood to their clothes.  The most hilarious is the main character's glued on mustache when he returns to town, to let you know he's a ""tough guy"".

The writing and acting, for the most part, is fairly dreadful.  The ""bad guys"" are the most hilarious of caricatures.  Black Bart meets Yosemite Sam.  The Navajo are portrayed as both the ""noble savage"" and as the ""magical healers"".  Two stereotypes for the price of one.  The railroad surveyors are hilarious anachronisms.

The only saving grace for this movie is that, in spite of its relatively safe PG-13 approach to filming and story, there is a surprising amount of darkness to the film.  This is what actually drew me in to the story and kept me from turning it off after 10 minutes.  Still, given all of countless great westerns that exist, I would put this film way down the list of movies in that genre that should be seen.  It wasn't entirely dreadful.  2.5 stars, rounding down.",1264032000,2,2073,4.647382920110193

I saw a review on here saying this was the best western since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tombstone/dp/6304711905/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tombstone</a>. Not even close. First off, let me explain the title of my review. Now I don't mean by saying that this movie is geared toward octogenarians/80 year olds as an insult. What I mean is this is the type of western made by Roy Rodgers and John Wayne back in the 50s and even 40s. They are pretty dry for the most part and look like they are shot in the hills behind the Hollywood sign. Nothing fancy in those oldies and nothing fancy here. The main building in the movie, a church, looks like a large version of a tool shed.  What drew me to this movie was the mention of the Civil War and it had a 2 minute Civil War scene that must have put them back [...] bucks to shoot. Another reason I wanted to see this move is because there haven't been many westerns made recently but surprisingly the ones getting the most publicity have been pretty good. Shadowhart is not.

Westerns started having much more of an edge in the 60s. Bad guys starting being really bad. The main bad guy in Shadowheart is annoying. Heck I wanted to shoot him 20 minutes into the movie just to shut up his bad dialog and mannerisms.  The story was very predictable. The acting was mixed, some were a little better then others, but overall what you would expect from a low budget indie or made for TV movies. When I am watching a western and thinking to myself that the women are out acting the men, Houston, you have a problem. Great films are the ones you want to watch over and over. I hope to never see Shadowheart again.

While formulaic, I loved the scenery and the whole feeling the movie gave.
I know some of the music didn't fit, I know it had huge gaping plot holes. The story line wasn't very strong. The acting wasn't very strong.
But, for all it's faults, it kept me involved and I was entertained. And, it wasn't as bloody as westerns are known to be, which I also appreciated.
So, bottom line... worth watching if it were on the tv, or if you could borrow it from a friend. :)",1253750400,2,556,4.254716981132075
3853921,2,B0026IQTO0,"Dean Alioto cast himself as the gunman Spider & also directed.  He was interesting as the assassin who kills for the bad guy Will Tunney.  Angus Macfadyen plays the bad guy with relish.  He does a very good job, although Alioto does him no favors with several over-the-top moments where it's hard to tell whether he's playing comedy like ""L.A. Dicks"" which Alioto also directed or a seriously evil man.  The dialogue and characterization tends to make Tunney ridiculous rather than callous as when he checks his hair in his pocket watch rather than attend to a mayoral meeting.  Add to this the sorely limited acting of Justin Ament who handles the grief of his wife's loss with sad puppy dog eyes, not even nearing the level of intensity needed to motivate the final scene.  The two actors playing American Indians, Michael Spears as Washakie and Tonantzin Carmelo as Miakoda, do well in the film, except for brief melodramatic touches by Carmelo.  Marnie Alton as Mary Cooper does an excellent job in her appearance as the bride.  Ines Dali is also quite impressive as Velma, the lady of the evening who somehow has a crush on the evil Tunney.  Shawn Reeves also turns in a good performance as Johny Cooper, Mary's brother the stable keeper.  Unfortunately, the script doesn't hang together very well.  I believe this film was intended to appeal to a Christian audience because of its philosophic emphasis on nonviolence.  However, it winds up portraying Christians as weak people who would rather allow their families to be killed rather than stand up to evil.  While I sympathized with the intent, the execution irked me.  William Sadler did a nice cameo as the preacher.  I stopped this film several times not wanting to watch more.  I did eventually make it through the entire film, but once was more than enough.  Taxi!",1253577600,2,1826,4.801282051282051

James Conners played by Justin Ament goes off to grow up and joins the ranks in the Civil War, witnessing horrific acts and learning to survive. He returns to avenge his father and marry the girl he left behind, Mary Cooper played by Marnie Alton.

They marry but do not live for long in happiness for she is killed and thanks to Native American Indians, James Conners in the end avenges his father, finding peace and living up to the image of Shadowheart, a transformed individual thanks to his experiences while living with his Navajo friends.

He returns to the town he grew up in and re-acquaints himself with a lost love (Marnie Alton).  What really hurts Shadowheart more than anything is the ultra-cliche nature of it all.  Everything featured in this film has been seen in plenty of westerns before it, and done much, much better as a result.  The film is so predictable from beginning to end, and it way too long in running time to boot.  Seriously, it doesn't take too long until it feels like torture getting through this film.  The horrible acting and sloppy direction don't help matters here either.  All in all, Shadowheart is by and far something worth avoiding.

3853924,4,B0026IQTO0,"Shadowheart was an interesting movie for me.  I liked the story overall, set in early west New Mexico, pre/post Civil War, where a young boy leaves a gritty growing town only to return to deal with his angst from his childhood and to cleanse himself from his difficulties he went through during the Civil War.

The movie itself is a little slow paced, yet the story itself is engaging with a few glimpses into some great potential. The actors do a great job in their parts.  You will recognize a few of them.  Telling is the work of Angus MacFadyen (who played Robert the Bruce in Braveheart).  He is the bad guy in the movie, and you really get this gut wrenching feeling about the character, so he really does a great job.  Frankly, we get the bad guys always looking smart or clean, but this guy is just an ugly mess.  Great performance.

The movie is soft on language and not much if any gore.  Although the violence is not completely off screen, there is no spurting blood everywhere when someone gets shot, so at least, you are more into the story than the gore.

Justin Ament is fairly new to me, so I was impressed with his acting, very serious brooding character who has flashes of insight on where he needs to be as a person.

I liked this movie and rated it a 4 for overall, yet the story line itself would be a 5.  It made me feel a little like Unforgiven as far as the feel of the screen work.  It could have used a little more on the wide view or panorama view to get a larger feel.  I think it would make a great TV pilot and would make a good TV show  like Lonesome Dove.

The only negative I felt that there were too many lines to follow, his childhood, the Civil War, the run in with the Indians, the train and the bad guy.  More focus by taking one of the items out would have helped.",1253145600,4,1803,4.179710144927537

The cast of young fresh faces is peppered with some authenticity by Sadler, Howard, Napier in their small roles.  While the production design could use a few more pounds of dirt and there are moments where the music just doesn't fit, I found myself engaged and fairly wrapped up in this tale of the wild west.  The authentic Navajo spoken by the Native Americans was a nice touch, and this movie serves up a ""cartoon"" classic bad guy in a good way as well.

When a young man returns to his hometown he tries to turn the other cheek when wronged, but when he loses the love of his life to the same man who murdered his father, boundaries of good and evil get blurred.

The plot started out great, with a Preacher, and sweet son, and then came the bad guy, who took over the town. By the middle of the movie it became more cheesy than anything good. I would say this would qualify for a Hallmark movie, my husband hated this movie and made rude comments about it being cheesy throughout the whole thing. I thought it was okay, there was no sex, and only one curse word that I could remember, yet there was some violence, not bad considering the normal violent movies. Although James did seek revenge in this movie, it was just deserved. I hated the bad guy too, and I guess that means he played his part well.

And Will Henry, that author makes the hundred years war seem a picnic in comparison. But this story has young love, the most miserable villian imaginable and a really great supporting cast of classic western actors that I enjoyed seeing. I hope this crew gets together again for another western with a more unique story. This was well done but it became a tad preachy in parts, remembering his father the slain minister.

3853931,4,B0026IQTO0,"I like the western film genre a lot.  Most of the films are about a west that never existed, but every once in a while you'll see something that's entertaining.

""ShadowHeart"" is the sort of film you might see on the Hallmark Hall of Fame Channel.  The script is okay, and the acting is actually pretty good.  What makes it sort of an average film is the rather slow pace at which the story unfolds and lack of character development.  A lot of this film, especially the rather mawkish beginning, seems to be one establishing shot after another.

I watched this dvd in two sittings.  During the first sitting, I got through the first half- hour or so.  After that I lost interest.  At that point, the Justin Ament character, James Conners, had returned to his hometown as a bounty hunter and proceeded to demand justice for his father's murder ten years or so previously.  At that point, Ament basically looked like a kid whom someone slapped a fake handlebar mustache on, and outfitted with typical cowboy gear. And way too laid back.

It seemed improbable.  Someone hell-bent on revenge or justice would have had a better plan.  In retrospect, I guess the James Conners character was supposed to be such a tough guy that he inspired fear in anyone he came into contact with.  That really didn't come across too well. The end result wasn't due to any lack of acting skill on Ament's part; it had more to do with the script itself.

So, at that point you had to use your imagination, because the film wasn't working very well. Which was why I turned the thing off and did something else.

During the second sitting, I picked up where I left off and watched if the pace would pick up.  Eventually, it did, and the story started to unfold at a faster pace.  I'm not going to go into a plot synopsis, because you probably wouldn't be interested in reading it anyway.  Besides, if you really want to know what the story was about, you can read one of the other reviews.

The film managed to hold my interest to its conclusion, but to be honest, I really didn't have anything else to watch anyway.  By the end of the film, I thought that ""ShadowHeart"" was about a B minus western.

The most notable aspect of this film was the actor Angus Macfadyen , best known for his previous role as Robert Bruce in the Mel Gibson Film, ""BraveHeart"".  His acting style in portraying the villain Will Tunney reminded me a lot of Rod Steiger. I really liked his performance - it was fun to watch.

""ShadowHeart"" isn't a film I'd want to watch over and over and over again.  It's not ""The Wild Bunch,"" or even ""The Hired Hand"".

There's not a lot of action here... And certainly nothing to shock a viewing audience.  However, if you're a hardcore fan of the western film genre, this family-oriented film  might be worth a look.",1252540800,,2805,4.479289940828402

The years pass and James Connor survives the horrors of the Civil War to return to Legend to fulfill his destiny. But all doesn't turn out as one might suspect.

Aside from the nice pace of development, Shadowheart lacked any ""sizzle"".  The acting was unremarkable.  The scenery was unremarkable. The plot was depressing.

There really isn't much to say about this movie.  The villain is totally disgusting and so you definitely want to see the hero get revenge or justice, but the ending is really nothing more than depressing.  Sure it might have been cliche to have a ""successful/cheerful"" ending but it would have been a lot better than how this plot failed.

3853936,1,B0026IQTO0,"Being a proud member of Amazon.com's Vine reviewers, I found myself pondering why some movies were available on occasion (usually ones I've never heard of), while others were not. I also consider myself a responsible reviewer; in other words, I'll read, sample, or watch whatever it is I get from Amazon's Vine program, regardless of what it looks like on the outside. Unfortunately, a pattern is emerging for The Vine program films. These are the seldom heard of ones I mentioned earlier. To give you an idea as to what types of films are being offered through The Vine, I'll use this one -- SHADOWHEART -- as an example.

First, let's take into consideration the fact that the film was produced by first-time film production company Desert Moon Pictures. Okay. So. Big deal. Now let's look at the main actor, Justin Ament. His film repertoire is not exactly stellar. He's had a lot of uncredited work (see ""extra""), obviously trying to break into Hollywood's mainstream. He's written two screenplays: this one, and another for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Path-of-Evil/dp/B000BGR0WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Path of Evil</a>. The Path of Evil, like Shadowheart, hasn't been lauded as very good cinema. But why?

Well, the easy answer is that the films just aren't that well thought-out nor well put together. In Shadowheart, we see cliche after cliche, and old character after old character. It's a recycle mish-mash of seriously poor proportions. Think of just about every Italian western starring Clint Eastwood and you'll have seen every character in this film many times over.

The only exception to the poor characters is Angus Macfadyen (best known for his role as Robert the Bruce in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braveheart/dp/B000NQRE0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braveheart</a>) as the wicked -- but still cliche stereotype -- Will Tunney. He played (perhaps overplayed) the role of the ruthless and amoral killer and made it, at the very least, fun to watch.

Everything else in this story was completely predictable. When I saw the young protagonist with the young girl in the beginning, I knew what would befall them long before it actually happened. And when I saw the sheriff trying to take the dastardly Will Tunney to the next town for imprisonment and possible hanging, I knew they'd never make it there. And this list of obviousness goes on and on and on and on.

So, getting back to my original quandary: why are some films available on The Vine and others aren't. Well, it's becoming painfully obvious now. Those DVDs that can't sell are given away in hopes of finding a sympathetic audience. But I simply cannot sympathize with drivel such as this. I'll write my review and post it for all to condone or trash, but I simply cannot give this film a positive spin when there's simply none to be found.",1251676800,2,2924,5.293103448275862
3853937,3,B0026IQTO0,"Quick, what is the first word that comes to mind to describe ""Shadowheart?"" Weak. Review finished.

Just kidding. The movie wanted to be good, the director tried, but too much of the film seemed cobbled together and not smoothly finessed. Film students in high school could have done better. In no particular order, here are things that marred the production and truly bothered me:

1. Opening: What does an Indian dance have to do with this film? A reason for its inclusion could be stretched, but mostly it's cobbled.

2. The biggest blunder comes with Will Tunney, movie's bad guy--gambler, womanizer, cheat, dissolute and immoral--played wonderfully by Angus MacFadden, although a bit over the top. What is the blunder? In his first scene he has rotten nubs for teeth. A few years later he has perfect teeth, obviously not ""false."" But yes, false, in that they are not false (which he carefully picks clean in public--I wanted to gag every time).
Note: I intentionally wrote #2 vague to show how vague was the non-explanation for the miraculous improvement of his teeth. The seeming moral here is that, if you take other people's land, your teeth will improve?

3. Time jumps. The most disturbing comes when James meets the two Navajos, brother and sister, on their forced march to New Mexico. He slips them a knife to free themselves, yet the story line later reveals that they escaped from the reservation where they learned really good English. The viewer is given no information about a time jump. So how the discrepancy? This is major.

4. The insertion of a Navajo woman who has become a Bible-reading Christian. She is shown receiving that Bible, then in a short period learns how to read it. How? She is the Christian witness in the movie and would have been very effective had the time problem been explained. But no, it's just a throw-in.

5. Shave off a man's big thick mustache and he becomes a new man. Maybe.

6. **SPOILER ALERT**NUMBERS 6-8 CONTAIN SPOILERS. READ NO FURTHER!
This is my own personal objection to plot development. It very well could have happened.
The marriage is not consummated!! Yes, good for moving the story forward, but oh so disappointing!! I object!!

7. When the bad guys beat up and shoot James, he just looks roughed up, not beaten to a pulp. The shooter is a ferocious, scary killer, yet his shot lands in that little sunken space between the breast bone and the shoulder. A big blunder!

8. James is shot repeatedly yet has the strength to get back to Mary's grave to die. Strains credulity!

9. Even though James kills in revenge and hatred, he still goes to heaven. Not a chance.

3853938,4,B0026IQTO0,"OK! I'll admit I'm one of those people that checks out the special features first. After viewing the ""Making Of"" I was all set for what's known in the theater as a vanity production.
  I too watched many Westerns with my grandfather, my father (and his sister after his death). In fact I may have watched too many. Perhaps the genre became less character driven as the violence ramped up. Perhaps the genocidal policies used  against the native population made seeing them as ""the bad guys"" less tolerable. Perhaps the politics of John Wayne and Ronald Reagan drove me away. Regardless it's a genre I rarely seek out these days.
  Shadowheart  includes all the beats I expect from a western, and face it they can't really be anything other than cliches today. Most of them are still being used  over and over again  in Space Operas. They define the genre.
  The real cliches  of Black Hats vs White Hats, or Cowboys vs Indians, are tastefully avoided. The production values are not cheesy.
  I found a few things in the script that could have been improved but not enough to complain.

3853942,5,B0026IQTO0,"""Shadowheart"" is what you watch westerns for in the first place -- a great journey with a hero you want to root for from the first scene in. ""Shadowheart"" tells the tale of James Conner, portrayed wonderfully by newcomer Just Ament, an earnest man who's preacher father is killed by the twisted town's land barren, Will Tunney, played superbly by Angus Macfadyen (""Braveheart""). The movie, which feels like a cross between Clint Eastwood's masterpiece ""Unforgiven"" and an old John Ford western, follows James when he returns to town many years later as a bounty hunter. He must make the choice between taking revenge, or holding his moral ground -- per his father's last dying wishes.

The heart of this story, however, is the long lost love of James' life, beautiful played by Marnie Alton. She underscores Jame's choice, challenging him to rise above retribution and find redemption. Unfortunately, another tragedy befalls James, one so horrible he may not come back from the dark side over. With the help of two native Americans, poignantly played by Tonantzin Carmelo and Michael Spears, James tries to remove the shadow in his heart. Without giving too much away, the film wraps up to an emotional and action-packed climax that leaves you wondering why they don't make westerns like this anymore.

Other performances worth noting are Will Tunney's henchmen, played by Courtney Gains and Anthony Michael Jones. James' father, William Sadler, gives an amazing performance that sets the whole movie into motion. Will Tunney's saloon girlfriend, Ines Dali -- quite haunting performance. And turning in a very charismatic and creepy performance as Tunney's deadly assassin, is the films director, Dean Alioto.

Speaking of the director, this film's execution feels more like a studio level movie than a direct-to-video release. The music, by Gregor Narholz is magical and John Williams-esque. The film is lush and richly photographed in widescreen by Andrew Huebscher. And the sets, by Travis Zariwny are epic. All this and a great script by Dean Alioto and Peter Vanderwall and Brad Goodman keep this film high on my DVD collection.",1249344000,3,2133,5.141210374639769
3853943,5,B0026IQTO0,"Shadowheart is a very powerful film that is intelligently produced.
The filmmakers should be congratulated for their skill in making an independent film that plays like a multi-million dollar big screen epic.
Set in an old western backdrop, the breathtaking vistas draw you in to a wonderful story. You can't help but root for the good guys and hate the bad guys.
There is an underlying message that gives the viewer cause to pause and ponder ""How far can one be pushed until action is taken....right and wrong....justice...forgiveness."" It's all there wonderfully acted, written and directed.
The ending reminds us that there is always something beautiful on the other end of our time here on earth.
Well done!!!",1249344000,8,713,5.0508474576271185
3853944,5,B0026IQTO0,"a traditional, heartfelt story of romance and revenge... angus macfadyen plays villain to newcomer justin ament's sweet but tortured soul. ines dali turns in a memorable performance as velma. beautifully filmed. the director makes the relatively small budget look like a much bigger studio picture, and also does a smokin hot performance as badass spider, madfadyen's right hand man. i liked this much more than 310 to yuma, and surprised it didn't make it to theaters.",1249257600,6,469,5.184210526315789
3853945,5,B0026IQTO0,"That guy, Robin Simmons, who reviewed this film sounds like someone who got fired off the film for being a jerk. Anyone who found the Nicholas Gage movie KNOWING ""sly"" and ""brilliant"" hasn't a clue what ""sly"" and ""brilliant"" is -- especially his argument that KNOWING was about humankind having ""free will"", when the kids in the movie are all kidnapped by aliens! His other reviews are very quasi-spiritual in nature so I would discount this bitter person (he ends his SHADOWHEART review with: ""Hollywood can do that to a person -- I should know"").

Back to this planet where a classic epic western drama that is brilliantly directed and written, not to mention earnestly acted, is a rare commodity and should be treasured. The movies theme of struggling over doing the right thing versus seeking revenge is even more timely in today's world. The end, which I don't want to spoil, has the lead character, played fantastically by newcomer Justin Ament, making a choice, not out of revenge, but necessity -- for the better of the town. He willingly falls on that spiritual sword. Though Mr. Simmon's very superficial un-insightful review completely missed this major distinction, I can not say how much I appreciate the filmmakers choice in portraying a character who must ""not be perfect"" in order to do the right thing.

And as far as the film having the ""trappings of a 'Christian production'""... PLEASE!  Mr. Simmons obviously has an axe to grind against Christians (see his other reviews) and is grossly misdirecting his anger at a film that is superbly poignant, spiritual, and transcending. And lastly, if THIS is Mr. Simmon's reactions to seeing a film for free, then maybe he should pay for his movies like everyone else!

Simply put: SHADOWHEART is that great western that you want it to be!",1249171200,6,1799,4.869281045751634

Random Comment:
- The title's a lot ""cooler"" than the movie. Title's a stretch for what actually happens.
- It's an okay western movie with some predictable plotlines and very pretty scenery.
- The bad guy's a tad overblown, but it's good in a ""hey, you're supposed to hate this guy"" sort of way.
-  Not exactly a ""feel good"" ""warm and fuzzy"" sort of movie, but then Westerns rarely are... so that fits fine.
- Dialogue and acting are fair.

Conclusion: Check it out if you're in the mood for a movie with horses and guns and clear-cut goodies and badies.",1457136000,,654,4.52542372881356
