8212352,5,B000U37U00,"Purchasing this DVD was basically done with fingers crossed and hopes of finding a few Music Videos by Whitney that I have had problems locating.  I have never been a fan of Dr. Dre - Whitney, YES.

There are 13 videos by Whitney:

Count On Me
Shoop
Fine
I Believe In You & Me
I Learned From The Best
If I Told You That
It's Not Right But It's Okay
My Love Is Your Love
One Of Those Days
Heartbreak Hotel
Step By Step
When You Believe
Why Does It Hurt So Bad

There is NO menu to navigate through, so the viewer must wade through 17 videos of Dr. Dre before reaching Whitney's
13 videos.  I just put my DVD player into fast forward - problem was solved.

I have always enjoyed Whitney's Music Video's, and was happy to locate those I have been searching for.  The picture quality was good as was the sound.",1338940800,,806,4.128205128205129
