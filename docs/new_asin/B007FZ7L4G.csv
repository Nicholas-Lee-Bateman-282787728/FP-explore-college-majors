5084066,1,B007FZ7L4G,"This play was HORRIBLE! It was very unrealistic, filled with hypocrisy, and it made the entire family look like naive idiots!",1355011200,3,125,5.0
5084067,5,B007FZ7L4G,Great performance.  Enjoyed it very much  Would recommend this play to all of my family and friends.  Money well spent.,1343865600,2,119,4.85
5084068,5,B007FZ7L4G,"I have enjoyed watching A Fool and His Money,  The play was very touching and entertaining. I have always enjoyed David E. Talbert's play and this one was no different.  I pre-ordered my copy and it arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend this play to others.  The cast was wonderful.  First time that I saw Rddie in a play and I really enjoyed him.  I was very satisfied that I purched this play to add to my David E, Talbert collection.",1341532800,,444,4.301204819277109
5084069,3,B007FZ7L4G,"Things wrong with this play.

1. Parents were too loose with their daughter's behavior with her boyfriend.
2. You don't walk into a Black family's house without knocking and door answered.

3. Decent Blacks don't allow their daughter to go out anytime she wants with a
  man much older than her..come in 7 a.m. in the morning and Daddy say nothing.
  Not a Black father. She was a teen...he was in very late 20s, early 30s.

4. Did not check out the boyfriend who was a 'dope pusher'and he had son and
  daughter in his pocket, ruining their lives.

5. They are broke with no money; Daddy don't listen to his kids, or son who is
  telling him he can win a million dollars on the radio.

6. Son puts their name in anyway and they call; daddy acting crazy on phone with
  contest people, and son had to grab the phone and holler out the answer to the
  contest and they win a million.  Then Daddy says,he won the money, Its his
  money.  What? They son won that money.

7. Daddy now controls all the money, gives silly daughter a $100,000 credit card, a
  teen; he did not give son a card. They blow all the money, did not pay taxes, go
  broke. Wife buys 20 pair of 1,000 shoes; 30 purses @ $5,000 each, etc.

8. His brother who he did not want to come to his house, or let him stay a few days,
  came to save them but Daddy with his mean attitude, everybody wrong but him, wolfs
  the whole time. Don't want to listen to anyone.

9. Boyfriend comes to kill son, etc; uncle saves him, daddy want to throw uncle out.
  Uncle is the one with the life raft for them all. Millionairs they were. They did
  not deserve anything from their behavior. Mean spirits winning.  No good.

This is the worse I have ever seen David E. Talbert write. Really bad play, and he said his funniest. He must have had a hangover this time. LOL",1340496000,6,1820,4.198250728862973
5084070,4,B007FZ7L4G,"Husband (Michael Beach) and wife (Cindy Herron-Braggs, formerly of En Vogue) both work hard to provide for their family, yet they struggle to pay the bills. And the stress becomes worse when Mr. Jordan loses his job. But then there's a call from a radio station, and the Jordan family's financial situation is changed.

I saw the name Michael Beach (Third Watch, First Sunday, Ruby Bridges, Soul Food, ER) and decided to watch this play. I didn't realize Mishon Ratliff (R&B singer, dancer, actor) was cast as the teenage son; when he came onto the stage, I became even more interested. I remember Mishon from Lincoln Heights, a show that aired on ABC Family and, in my opinion, shouldn't have been cancelled. He is a talented young man and his presence is what made this play so entertaining for me.

After what Mrs. Jordan said to her husband because she was tired of having so little (I felt for Mr. Jordan at that moment), I thought she'd be more responsible when the money came. Actually, I thought they'd all have better sense than to make so many bad choices, and I kept wondering how they could be so wasteful, but the play is called `A Fool and His Money' - Jesus warned us to beware of selfishness and greed (Luke 12:15). Barely scraping by had affected Mr. and Mrs. Jordan's marriage and their son's education, but I guess they forgot all about that when dollars signs were all they could see. They needed to change their mindsets, and then they would have dealt with the million dollars wisely.

David E. Talbert shows how family members can allow money to tear them apart. He also shows how you never know who you're going to need: The family didn't like it when a long lost uncle (Eddie Griffin) showed up unexpectedly, but it turned out they were blessed to have him there. And he shows how some females will settle for less than they want in a man. There is also an important message of forgiveness in this well-acted stage play.

A Fool and His Money is a musical comedy-drama. I liked the singing, the humor (my favorite part is when Mr. Jordan had his son get out the Bible), and the ending.

5084090,5,B007FZ7L4G,"This was very nicely done.  It was food for thought on just how we'd all act after coming into a large amount of money.  $1 mil. is nice, but it's not a  heck of a whole lot after taxes.  HAHA.
The movie songs were good, the story line.........good, but not 100 percent realistic..........well, not in my home.  HAHA.  The ending was perfect.  Eddie Griffith brought his cool suave acting to the fore in this.",1401235200,,409,4.445945945945946

5084095,5,B007FZ7L4G,I REALLY LIKED THIS. PEOPLE DO SOME STRANGE THINGS FOR A PIECE OF CHANGE. MONEY CAN BE A FOOL SOMETIMES,1386806400,,103,4.2
5084096,3,B007FZ7L4G,I think I like the script more then some of the actors. Some characters seemed to be over acting and some underacting. But I do like the concept and how it plays out. David E. Talbert has great talent I just wish his cast did as well. I normally try to watch this on BET but I never finish it so when I found it on here I went ahead a finished it.,1381104000,,347,3.767123287671233
5084097,4,B007FZ7L4G,"Unique cast members. All very seasoned. Hadn't seen Cindy Herron in years from her EnVogue days. Of course she was first with Clarence Muse agency in LA before music.
Not as good had it been created for film, but they did a good job with stage. Talbert's is slightly comparable to Tyler Perry's.",1380672000,2,295,4.584905660377358

5084100,4,B007FZ7L4G,This play is ok. I am not all that crazy a out it.its nothing to me to write home about.,1372377600,,88,3.45
5084101,2,B007FZ7L4G,seemed a bit contrived couldn't make it to the end. make believe is only fine when the audience wants to play along . i didn't,1370822400,,126,4.08
5084102,3,B007FZ7L4G,"Much of the story line had to be filled in by the viewer's imagination. This is not unusual for stage plays, but the story line was a bit trite. I think I overlooked the words Play in the description and that added to my disappointment with the product. It was OK but the story line was still a bit shallow.",1368489600,,307,4.133333333333334
5084103,1,B007FZ7L4G,"When I started watching the play, I anticipated a moral story on how the love of money is indeed the root of many evils, and how money works as a magnifier that brings out the true character (flaws and all) of those who come upon it. I thought the play would show how money exposed their deeply morally derelict and jaded characters, and that the resolution would be introduced by their flaws being pointed out, addressed, and then the characters would be convicted of the need to change in order to be immune to the ups and downs of life, and not be so flimsy at the call of a dolloar.

But no. The characters were all completely foolish. AND--it stayed that way!! That's what hurt the most. So much frustration anticipating yet never seeing a realistic resolution.

~ The father was everything but a wise manager of his home which showed through his poor ability to realize his daughter's foolish decisions and in how he was actually promoting her degeneracy by endorsing her rude, ignorant, foolish boyfriend, and accepting her unacceptable behavior. What's more, when his wife tried to point these things out, he brushed her away as if her concerns were not realistic!

~ The mother was rightly frustrated at their prolonged situation--yes--but she was a horrible keeper of the home, also. Her husband loses his job and she doesn't so much as comfort him, but instead immediately chooses to begin blaming him for their situation and for his inability to provide for them (as if he chose to lose his job???). And then--get this--she decides that she can't handle the rough-and-tumble broke life anymore, so she's going to leave him and the kids and go get the, and I quote, ""finer things"" she deserves--that is, until she finds out they've won a million dollars. Oh, then she's down ;D.

~ The son is extremely uneducated, ignorant, and simple (if well-intentioned) in his ambitions to help the family through hard times by skipping classes to find work and support his family. The father, of course (and the mother, too!) are the ones to blame for such poorly intellectually raised children. You can be smart and wise even while you are broke, so money is no excuse.

~ The daughter is a bubble-gum-pop, care-free, can't-be-bothered pretty girl that pays her mother no regard, but *adores* her father who endorses whatever she does (regardless of how inappropriate and destructive it may be). Apparently (at least to me, and maybe you, too once you get further into the plot), she has horrible confidence issues, yet places her worth in the love her father has for her and dates a man who treats her like his personal pleasure property. Just a play in the life of another poorly-reared child continuing the cycle ignorance and horrible decisions. Though it is not delved into very deeply, she is clearly looking for love and hurting inside; she's looking for something real, unconditional and unwavering, yet is pitifully clueless and ignorant.

~ The well-meaning, Bible-knowing grandmother is a nice staple addition that no ""Black play"" would be complete without. The old-timer that knows ""the Word"", loves the Lord, but is all too naive and powerless, and makes no real Christian impact on her family, though she cares much for them and her heart clearly bleeds for their circumstances (she is caring, yet naive and ineffective).

You'd think with ALL these issues the writer would bring some focus on the fact that this whole family is certifiably ""jacked up"" and is in serious need of an awakening and some character salve, right? ---NOPE!! The revelation of a little heart-warming act by Uncle Skeeter at the end takes the focus off of their severe dysfunction, and money (and a little cute moral learned) saves the day!! Whooo!!!

-_-.

This play grieved my heart. The actors were great. Their talent was very good and the singing, too, was well-done. But the plot--OOOHHH the plot--a complete bomb. The acting, the *flow* of the plot (not the plot itself, mind you) and the script style were each acceptable, and...*Siiigh*...it all really had such a grand opportunity to edify people (even if the writer didn't want it to be ""Too Christian"", it could have STILL had a deeper resolution, although I strongly think if you're going to include Jesus, include Him, and if not, then don't. No wishy wash please!). But instead of giving a deep moral revelation and deep edification, it glazed over some good ideas, some nice little acts of heart-warming kindness, and missed the WHOLE point. Wow. Grieved. Grieved. A fool's play, indeed this was.",1366243200,4,4552,4.855670103092783

5084126,4,B007FZ7L4G,"Not to be taken too serious. A fool and his money is a simple nice story that centers around 8 characters. If you try to analyze this story, you will find hundreds of flaws. The best way to enjoy it is to take it as a light sunday afternoon low budget play, sit back and enjoy.  (Wish they changed the setting though! The entire story was played out in one room even after winning a million, the house remained the same. Plus Tabitha, the daughter could not buy a new set of boots even after winning the big bucks! I got tired of seeing the same boots on her).  However, Good job David! I enjoyed the happy ending the most.",1356912000,,623,4.183333333333334
