1229792,5,B00000IPVN,"I saw this movie back in the sixties, when I was a teenager still at high school. In my mind, I kept  the image of a great western. Just out of curiosity, I got it from a video rental store the other day to see it  again. Well, I decided I had to buy it and have it in my classics  collection. It seems to me that it became even better after 33 years.  Brando in his prime, Saxon cynical and tense, and what a beauty was  Anjanette Comer.",947894400,4,438,3.8764044943820224

1229814,5,B00000IPVN,A wonderful film. The first time  I saw this movie I thought to myself it would be even more terrific in widescreen and I was right. It looks great. Throughout the movie Marlon has his moments where he completely owns the scene and it makes u appreciate his craft. I recommend it,1438300800,3,279,4.365384615384615

1229818,5,B00000IPVN,I have always liked Marlon Brando as an actor and especially in a western. He is good in this movie. I have been looking for this movie for a long time. I am glad Amazon had it.,1395014400,,177,3.810810810810811

1229820,3,B00000IPVN,"This is Brando's 'spaghetti Western,' released at the height of that sub-genre's popularity in 1966, but only in terms of style since the film was shot in California and Utah rather than Spain. The Southwestern scenery is spectacular and worth the price of admission. Imagine one of Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns but with gritty realism rather than goofiness and you'd have a good idea of what the film's like.

""The Appaloosa"" is essentially a revenge tale entailing Brando's trip to Mexico to get his horse back. John Saxon stars as the villain who steals Brando's horse after beating him up while in a drunken stupor. Ajanette Comer plays the babe.

I wasn't all that impressed with the story the first time I saw it, especially since I compared it with Brando's Western masterpiece ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Eyed-Jacks-Slim-Case/dp/B0007WPJBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One-Eyed Jacks [Slim Case</a>]"" (a powerful precursor to the spaghetti Western and the only film Marlon directed). The story in ""The Appaloosa"" is rather slow-paced with few action scenes. I saw it again recently and it dawned on me that the director and writer were not shooting for a run-of-the-mill Western. In the mid-to-late 60's it became fashionable to make films as gritty and realistic as possible. (Brando's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-of-the-Following-Day/dp/B00009AOBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night of the Following Day</a>"" from 1968 is a good example). What would happen in REAL life if a man went to Mexico in the late 1800's and tried to retrieve his stolen horse? This picture shows you. Consider the confrontation-in-a-saloon scene; we naturally expect it to end in a cliched brawl or shoot-out. It doesn't. In other words, it sneers at Western conventions. Or how about the final shoot-out? Some have complained that it's uneventful and quick, yet isn't this the way such death-duels end in real life most of the time? In short, don't expect ""The Appaloosa"" to play like a Hollywood blockbuster or typical spaghetti Western with corny one-liners and goofy action scenes.

Another thing I like about the film is the Brando Character's relationship with his adopted Mexican family, which shows genuine kinship and warmth that transcends blood ties. Same thing with his relationship with an old man in Mexico.

So ""The Appaloosa"" is worthwhile, but the story drags and holds it back from greatness. Still, if you're in the mood for a Mexican Western with slow-moving realism, look no further.

GRADE: C+ or B-

Brando made two other Westerns and both are masterpieces, albeit totally different: The aforementioned ""One-Eyed Jacks"" from 1961 and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Missouri-Breaks/dp/B000B6CO48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Missouri Breaks</a>"", which was released 15 years later and co-stars Jack Nicholson. Brando played one of his most fascinating characters in the latter, an eccentric loner who takes jobs killing horse thieves.",1361059200,,3093,5.831858407079646
1229821,2,B00000IPVN,"Co-star John Saxon memorably summed up the basic storyline of ""The Appaloosa"" (1966): ""Boy meets horse, boy loses horse, boy gets horse."" No wonder Marlon Brando looks bored in this lackluster effort - he's doing little more than fulfilling a Universal contract. Russell Metty's impressive photography is offset by the pretentious direction of Sidney J. Furie. It's a pity that Brando never made a truly outstanding Western.",1343779200,,424,5.343283582089552
1229822,2,B00000IPVN,"Marlon Brando was a great actor, but that doesn't mean that everything he did was great.  In this film, which you can tell he didn't take seriously because he barely acts, the only thing he adds is a little atmosphere.  The story is also ridiculously unrealistic:  the lone wolf setting out for revenge against a bunch of greasy, really bad Mexicans.  He dreams of starting a ranch, has an extended family he loves, meets a (stunningly beautiful) abused woman (by the baddies, and yes, he saves her and maybe falls for her).  There are a few fun scenes, like the arm wrestle or the glinting rifle, but this does not a movie make.

Not recommended.",1338768000,,647,4.582608695652174

1229824,3,B00000IPVN,"It is good to see Marlon Brando again in this 1956 western, although he is not really given a good chance to show his acting skill. John Saxon plays a Mexican bandit with many henchmen, and does a very good acting job. It is 1870, and Brando has returned to the area where he grew up with some money to start a ranch and an appaloosa horse. He admits to a priest that he has killed men and women in war and now wants peace. Unfortunately, Saxon and his men steal Brando's horse, and Brando feels compelled to go and retrieve his property despite the overwhelming odds against him. The film focuses for the most part on his encounter with Saxon and his men, the difficulties that he has, and his attempt to rescue a woman that Saxon is holding captive.",1315440000,,751,4.333333333333333

Shot in Technicolor on location in the Texas/Mexico border area by spy thriller specialist Sidney Furie, this competent, well-paced  western features striking vistas and strong performances from its two principals.

1229827,3,B00000IPVN,"I watched ""The Appaloosa"" the other day because I think Marlon Brando was an outstanding actors (who, alas, did not always pick the right roles).  I was sure that I'd never seen this movie before until about two thirds of the way through.  There was a scene that gave us a look at a unique form of armwrestling.  I realized that I had seen that before but I didn't recall any of the rest of the movie.  Frankly, that's not surprizing give the way this movie drags on as long as it does.  However, I did notice something that intrigued me.  This movie has a lot of facial closeups and I couldn't help but notice what excellent teeth everyone has.  I mean, teeth this clean, white and perfect had to have cost thousands of dollars.  It wasn't just John Saxon either.  Everyone has perfect teeth!  All this in a remote desert bordertown in 1870.  You might think I'm overdoing this but ""The Appaloosa"" left me just bored enough to look for something to take interest in.",1167782400,3,967,4.4375
1229828,3,B00000IPVN,"Matt Fletcher (Marlon Brando), is a tight-lipped loner who returns from the Civil War to his surrogate family in the border town of Ojo Prieto to settle down. When Matt's prize Appaloosa stallion (played by Cojo Rojo) is stolen by bad banditos and spirited away to Mexico, he goes after them with a vengeance. Somewhat slow, and the title character isn't in the movie all that much.

1229829,3,B00000IPVN,"As much as I'd love to love this film,it didn't really do it for me. Although I did love Brando's performance in this movie as a weary run-down man ready to start a new life, but disrupted by thieves who steal his prized appaloosa. And although the movie is beautifully shot, there are some funky camera angles and close-ups that could have been done away with. The story is short and very simplistic, which is not a big problem, but it could have had a little more meat to it. Like for example, the ending shoot-out scene. Brando's character fires a line of shots and the main antagonist is killed, just like that, so simple, no real tension build up, no long series of shots fired back and forth just a few shots and that was that. I was left sitting there saying, ""Is that it?"" I guess I can say I liked the film a liitle bit, but didn't love it. If you must see this film by all means rent it from the library or video store, or catch it on AMC. But if you just can't resist, then order it used and as cheaply as possible...sorry",1090886400,6,1033,4.1959798994974875

This is a story about a group of banditos who raided Matt Fletcher's (Brando) ranch left  him for dead and stole his appaloosa.  Brando stalks the thieves obsessed  with getting his beloved horse.  The rest of the film shows Fletcher's  struggles with the thieves in a succession of action packed  showdowns.
This is one of my favorite westerns.  Brando was serious,  courageous and determined.  He is a great character actor who can adapt to  almost any role and play it well.  This is Brando at the top of his  game.
They don't make films like this anymore.  The movie was well cast  and very genuine and realistic.  If you like westerns, this is one you  shouldn't miss.",967420800,23,730,4.712
