8311767,5,B001J2SFMS,Great old B Western Series - staring Buck Jones & Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton - staring as US Marshals.  What makes this especially wonderful is that I only discovered Buck Jones - whom many believe to be the greatest of the B Western Cowboys - this year.  What is also great fun for those fans of the B Westerns - is being able to recognize the bad guys - such as - Jack Ingram -  Slim Whitaker - Charles King -  John Merton and a whole slew of other downright nasty henchmen.  Highly recommend.,1423008000,,497,4.189473684210526

8311773,5,B001J2SFMS,"Buck Jones was one of Hollywood's first super-stars. He produced and directed many of his 200 westerns when westerns were the biggest of all money makers.
In his later years came some of his best moments in Monogram Pictures' popular Rough Riders series. Only now when he stood up to the bad guys, he didn't go for his gun, he reached for a stick of chewing gum. That was a signal to every kid in the audience to look out, a bad guy had just given him some guff and was about to get his head handed to him.
Someone asked Buck why he didn't play a bad guy once-in-awhile. He said he didn't think ""the little shavers"" (his fans) would like it.
No, those liitle shavers would not have liked it at all.

The Rough Riders ride beware
the Rough Riders ride take care
they're the finest bunch of fighters in the land
chasing every rustler and guerilla band.

The Rough Riders watch the trail
the Rough Riders never fail
they keep law and order everywhere they go
without a fear of any foe
and you know they know you're always on their side
when those ol' Rough Riders ride
when those ol' Rough Riders ride . . . YES!",1359331200,8,1109,4.251184834123222
