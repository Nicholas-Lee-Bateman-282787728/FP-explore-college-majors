3556305,5,B001EN1R18,"We never had this detailed instruction to tap into.  It's the ""little things"" that are overlooked.  Those ""little things"" always turn into ""Big Things"" when not addressed in practice.  Not only should every coach have these tools of learning, but every parnet needs all of the instruction ""The Ripken Way"" has to offer.  Why have the burden of breaking bad habits?  The parnet can now coach his/her own children, and take a active part in coaching their team.  Mystery over.  Bill and Cal Ripken breaks the game down to easy to understand principles, the most important aspect of Playing Baseball is Playing, no matter what age you are.  Nothing changes, the bigger the boys, the bigger the toys; with the game of baseball, we can play as kids through playing/instructing our kids.  The bigger we get, the faster we pitch, the further we hit, etc., if we have proper training and instruction. We now play, and have fun learning with ""The Ripken Way"". Priceless!",1345852800,,961,4.810975609756097
3556306,5,B001EN1R18,"I'am a first time baseball coach, life long athlete. Although I grew up playing baseball I was a little hesitant to to take the title as a 11 year old baseball team ""Head Coach"", ""Baseball the Ripken Way"" gave a perfect outline of simple fundamentals and drills that can be applied at any level of play.",1337472000,,303,4.428571428571429
3556307,5,B001EN1R18,My kids play baseball and have for many years.  This video set is educating and alot of fun to watch and learn.  Even if you are good at Baseball you could still learn a few things about this.  We highly recommend it.!,1328659200,,218,4.142857142857143
3556308,5,B001EN1R18,I love it. it show everything you need to now about pitching batting and defence Grate DVD I recommend this DVD for all kid of all ages I even learned a couple of things there.if you ate just staring baseball or you want some pointers thie is the the DVD for you.,1310601600,,263,4.076923076923077
3556309,5,B001EN1R18,"These videos are fantastic- I highly recommend them for anyone who wants to coach or teach their kids the right way to play baseball. The drills can be started at a young age (in parts) and continued up thru the high school level.  The video's don't go over every possible situation or skill, and I don't think it was ever their intention to do so, but they do cover those skills and fundamentals that are critical to future development. While the videos cover basic skills, and then some, the detailed explanation, subtle tips & cues and drills make the difference between almost learning a skill and learning a skill. I have tried most of the drills with my team and the kids love them, without really knowing how advanced the techniques are. A must for anyone that wants to teach their kids the right way to play.",1298246400,7,816,4.551020408163265
3556310,5,B001EN1R18,"Baseball has always been a passion, and I just wanted to share this love of the game with someone I care very much about. Although this person is still relatively young, and new to the game, this was the perfect introduction to feed a hungry soul. They just didn't have wonderful instructional information like this when I was his age. The knowledge that a great deal of information can be passed along, is comforting to someone like myself who is a great distance away. It contains concise information that can be practiced, and then you always have the information you need right at hand, by simply reviewing the DVD again. P.S., if you wanted to know anything about Baseball, Cal Ripken Jr. would be a great choice.",1420329600,,718,4.661417322834645

3556314,4,B001EN1R18,Thought the DVDs were good.  I wish they would have provided more details with the hitting lessons.  The hitting lesson was very basic and didn't provide more details about angles and balance.  Overall I thought the we're good.  I would recommend purchasing.,1405123200,,258,5.071428571428571

3556318,5,B001EN1R18,"As a baseball coach of youth baseball I found this to be one of the best video series I have ever used.  The drills are easily repeatable, and the instruction is thorough and easy for kids to understand.  I watch the videos, and then have the parent and their son or daughter watch the video, and then we do the drills.  The kids really pick up quickly on the instruction.

Well worth the money!",1389139200,,395,4.297297297297297
3556319,5,B001EN1R18,These DVDs are really well done.  I got these in the hopes of picking up some coaching tips and new drills and was amazed how much I picked up watching them. My seven year old son loves watching them as well.  I wish the Ripken's would make some more.,1385856000,,251,4.1020408163265305
3556320,3,B001EN1R18,"Overall good, but the Ripken brothers spent too much time talking crap about each other. I guess they need that to fill in time  for the DVDs.",1384646400,,142,4.2592592592592595
3556321,5,B001EN1R18,"I am an assistant Little League coach with two small kids of my own playing (ages 5 & 6).  These DVD's are a great addition to coaching and teaching kids of all skill levels.  We incorporate many of the instructions on a daily basis during practice, not to mention the work I do with my own kids.

The instruction from the DVD's have helped our team incorporate new exercises into practice.  I can definitely see changes in our team and an improvement in technique that these instructions have helped foster.

In addition, my kids really enjoy watching them.  By simply watching them, they then try to mimic what is taught on the video without me explaining the exercise too much.

I would highly recommend these video's for all students and coaches of the game.",1381708800,,762,4.641791044776119
3556322,5,B001EN1R18,the video is an excellent tool for young baseball players.  I have coached youth for years and this teaches it right in an easy to understand format.  It could maybe go in depth more for the more advanced kids,1374451200,,209,4.333333333333333

It is amazing and full of information and practice tips that can be shared with ballplayers of any age. My son and I coach 12 years of age baseball players and we are incorporating this DVD 3-Pack into our practice format. It really is super, super, super.
