But, it is a very informative dvd and if you can take a couple of hours torture, you will learn a lot about T-SQL programming. The quality of sound is quite better than other DVpress products, but could be even better. Over all 3.75 stars for this product which if we round up will give ****",1114905600,3,361,4.246376811594203
7999393,1,B0000CGDQT,"Here is my honest opinion:

I couldn't recommend this DVD if it were priced at $9.95!

Where to start? It commits a multitude of sins: poorly organized, rambling and hesitant delivery, using terms without defining them first, misspelled words on the power point slides, jump cuts, lip synch problems, continual promises to explain or demonstrate something later -- some never fulfilled.

I was a technical training professional for a number of years, and I think that a beginning student would suffer greatly and get little practical information.  I feel that my money was wasted.  Stick to a book.

As always, your mileage may vary.",1112400000,3,633,5.038461538461538
