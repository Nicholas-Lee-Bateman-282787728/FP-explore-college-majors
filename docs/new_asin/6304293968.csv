834554,5,6304293968,"Honey We Shrunk Ourselves is diffrent for comedy wannabies. This film is so funny, you may feel like to have to use the bathroom. Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) has been banned from useing his shrinking machine by a goverment and his wife.
One day, His wife named Diane (Eve Gordon) and his sister-in law named Patty (Robin Bartlett) are going on a vaction. Wayne and Gordon are staying at Wayne's house to babysit. Even his brother's kids two.",991267200,4,444,4.705128205128205
834555,3,6304293968,"My five year old son watched this film at Christmas and I sat with him by the fire.  Have you seen the back of the video?  It looked like a re-hash of the first story but much worse - adventures like ""getting stuck in a bubble"" - ""So good you won't even see it at the cinema!""  I was expecting it to be so bad, but sat through it with my son, dreading having a rubbish afternoon.
But all in all I was pleasantly surprised.  My son laughed and had a good time - I didn't laugh much I have to say, but it's a kid's film.  My son loved the first film (which we have had on video for years), didn't like the second one (""It didn't have any 'shrunking',"" he said), and liked this one second best.  After renting it that day, we're now planning to buy it.  Worthwhile if you liked the first (in my view a bit weaker though) and if you thought the second was a disappointment.",990748800,2,869,4.017441860465116
834556,4,6304293968,"A friend and I watched this movie last night and we really enjoyed it.  I found myself laughing a lot while watching this movie!  This movie also has  a really good plot.  It is a good, clean, entertaining movie for the whole  family to watch.  It is a movie that the parents will enjoy just as much as  the children.  Also, unlike some sequences, this movie is just as  entertaining as the first, 'Honey We Shrunk The Kids'.  Also, you do not  need to see the original movie to understand this one.",967593600,,499,4.315217391304348

It was cute, it was entertaining, it was amusing, it had a  great message at the end, and NO, it was not in the least bit BORING!  My  five year old daughter was even intrigued by it; unfortunately, it was on  past her bed-time!  I'm thinking of buying it, though, because it would  make a fun addition to our movie collection!  This is a great family movie  for all ages.  My opinion?  Watch it, and I bet you'll end up laughing and  being pleasantly surprised by it yourself!",965952000,,641,4.1735537190082646

  I found  Honey we shrunk ourselves to be funny and exciting.  It is a true family movie..It is very creative and fast paced.  The values of family concern for one another comes through in a very natural way.  We really loved this movie!.
  Honey I shrunk the kids is also very exciting and funny.  The two films are very different  from one and another.  This one does have some romance between the teenage girl from one family and the boy from another  on their adventure to be found and saved.  It involves two small parts were they kiss for a while .It is an enjoyable movie I made mention of the kissing in case a parent would find that not suitable for their young child.
I watched both movies with a 14 year old.  We loved them both.",1424390400,,822,4.219354838709678

835561,5,6304293968,"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves is a direct-to-video Disney movie, and is the 3rd film in the Honey, I Shrunk The Kids Trilogy. This movie is really funny and I love it. It's really fun, and it is just as enjoyable as the original. The parents are hilarious and so likable. In this movie, the parents accidentally shrink themselves, and they have to go on an adventure through the house and find a way to get the attention of their kids so that they can get big again.

This is a fun movie and I totally recommend it.",1375574400,,512,4.278350515463917

835565,5,6304293968,"I haven't seen this movie in a long time. I enjoyed it when I first saw it and still would now. I really like it because it shows how older children (despite what their parents think) are abel to take care of themselves. Case in point, when Ricky drags Jenny away from the party to steal an unwanted kiss Jenny discourages him and calls off the party. A great and fun movie for the whole family!",1328140800,,395,4.2105263157894735

835696,4,6304293968,"Even though I really enjoyed Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, I did not care for the trailers for Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, so I skipped that one. But when Honey, We Shrunk Oursevles was released on the Disney Channel I wasted no time in watching it and loved it. I had taped it on video but decided to purchase it on DVD throgh Amazon. It was unfortunate that when it and the other DVD I ordered with it came in the middle of my moving to a new place so it was a while before I viewed it, and a while before my review. The disc played perfectly with no skips or other problems, and I enjoyed the antics of Wayne, Marcia, Gordon and Patty, as they tried to figure out a way to return themselves to full size while viewing with growing apprehension the antics of their children. While some scenes, such as how Marcia and Patty get transported to the top of the counter for Mitch's medicine, strained my credibility a little, it is still a movie that brings out a lot of laughs and chuckles. The part where some older boys break in on an impromptu party may be a bit much for younger kids. One scene involving Wayne and Marcia's son and a certain magazine that opened Wayne's eyes up to the fact maybe his son wasn't meant to be a scientist, and how Patty's daughter proves she is more responsible than her mother thought at first, might give parents insights into their own kids' feelings about similar matters.",1245196800,,1403,4.2981132075471695
835697,5,6304293968,"I know that the first  movie in this series is the classic, but if you ask me, the Real classic is this one. The storyline,the morals, the special affects, and the humor are all 100% better than the first  movie. Also, it is tamer and funnier for kids. Also, this movie is a lot like ""Home Alone"" if you like ""Home Alone"", you will like this movie, too! It is very funny and also has a few loving morals (Many  parents want their children to grow up to be like them. However, some children have their own interest in life and do not fallow their parent's path. When this happens, parents should not be disappointed, but supportive, and encourage their children to go in their own direction. It's  not wrong to be different from your parents and have your own path in life!)  My favorite part is when the kids are doing all the things they were told not to do becuse they are home alone...(or think they are!!)
 Every movie series is differant, sometimes the original is the original and best, sometimes they do better the 2nd time round, and sometimes they save the best movie for last, as they did here. so see the ""Grand Finallie"" of the series, the best of the series, the REAL classic!",1216080000,3,1189,4.406392694063927
835698,3,6304293968,"Remember the funny movie ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,"" and the almost as funny ""Honey, I Blew Up the Kid?""  Well, this movie is much like those.  Except in this movie there is a different wife.  Oh; and there are kids missing.  And now Wayne Szalinski's (Rick Moranis) brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin) has appeared.  Perhaps this movie is not so much like those after all.

We quickly learn that a few things have changed for Wayne since last we visited him.  The FDA has forbidden Wayne to use his shrinking machine on people.  Wayne is in the process of sending his shrinking machine to the Smithsonian.  Wayne and Gordon's wives are heading off to a vacation, leaving Wayne in Gordon in charge of the house.

All initially seems sort of well, except that Wayne wants to shrink a Tiki man that his wife wants to him to throw away.  Predictably, something goes wrong and Wayne and Gordon are accidentally shrunk.  Shortly thereafter the wives, realizing they forgot to leave medicine behind, return.  Soon the wives are accidentally shrunk, and we are once again on a path for a few yucks and a few groans.

This movie is reasonably decent.  Much of it seems somewhat of a retread.  There are the usual moments of fear as the foursome run from a cockroach and help a daddy longlegs spider, more moments of fun in a ride on a toy car, a dip in the dip, a ride in a soap bubble, and more.

This direct-to-video movie has less imagination than the first two movies.  The atmosphere of this 75 minute ""full-length"" feature is that of a made-for-tv movie.  I did enjoy the movie, but I wish I had looked for it in a bargain bin somewhere rather than paying full price.

If you really liked the first two movies, you will likely enjoy this movie.  If you cared little for the first two movies, you should avoid this one.  Even if you think you might like it, the movie still feels like something made for the Disney channel.  Good luck!",1131408000,16,1927,4.474137931034483
835699,3,6304293968,"This direct to video entry in the one-time imaginative series is mildly entertaining, although it is little more than an adult retread of the original.  This time Rick Moranis (with a new wife played by Eve Gordon and only one kid this time) shrinks himself, his wife and his brother (Stuart Pankin) and his wife, and they find themselves confronting a giant cockroach as their main enemy, and a cute daddy longlegs helps the mommies out.  It's not all that inventive but I found myself chuckling every once in a while.  Might entertain the younger set.",1124496000,6,553,4.739583333333333
835700,3,6304293968,"Contrary to popular belief, this is not a new movie.  Not at all.  This is actually Disney's very first direct-to-video live action films, which was first released in 1997.  It did not go over well and has long since been the hardest to find of the trio.  Unlike the other two theatrical films, this movie was only ever released in full frame... so us widescreen enthusiasts have nothing to complain about here.  What I can complain about is the overall cheap-feeling that this film has.  Rick Moranis is the only original character, and the action does not have the epic, theatrical quality of the original films.  This feels like a 2-day shoot soundstage production with a very closed-in feeling.  It's kind of like taking the first five minutes of ""Toy Story,"" with the army men on the staircase, etc. and extending that claustrophobic feeling for the 65-minute running time.  All in all, this most compares to a typical Disney Channel Original Movie.  In fact, it's been shown as one ever since its release!!  Not exactly a Disney highpoint, collectors will want this third film to complete the collection...",1035417600,9,1112,4.861702127659575
