Milarepa is one of the most well known and respected yogi poets in Tibetan history. Marpa made him experience  years of hardships to negate his karma from killing by sorcery. Finally, master Marpa gave him  teachings. His life is like a legend inspiring  faith.

2951784,3,B000VSPN4O,"The ""Life of Milarepa"" is a religious classic, a very inspiring hagiographic biography of Tibet's beloved spiritual master and poet. Sonam Tulku's film is an earnest but flawed attempt to portray this on screen. I am guessing that a low budget, and its Taiwanese production, probably precluded it being made in Nepal, Bhutan, or anywhere resembling Tibet; moveover there were many anachronisms, such as bandits having rifles (in the 11th century!), porcelain bowls instead of wooden Tibetan-style ones, modern rugs and locks, etc. The action is very slow, and potentially dramatic scenes (such as the hailstorm destroying Milarepa's village) are alluded to but not shown (budget, again). Only the first part of Milarepa's life is shown, and none of his striking songs or profound teachings are presented. There is another film of the same name coming out, by the director of ""The Cup,"" filmed in the Himalayan region of India--hopefully, it will be able to do better justice to this wonderful story. On the positive side, there is some lovely scenary (Mysore? Taiwain?), fine amateur actors, and a wholly accurate-seeming although somewhat ""cleaned-up"" portrayal of traditional Tibetan life.",1191369600,3,1191,5.340425531914893

We were very impressed with the cinematography and scenery.  The story was an interesting journey that gave us insite into the culture of Bhutan.  Yes, this is about a Tibetan saint, but directed by Neten Chokling, a Lama from Western Bhutan.  We only wish hat the promissed second part, or sequel, was made.

I was familiar with the story of Milarepa (the murderer/sorcerer who repented and underwent severe trials to obtain enlightenment).  The visually stunning  movie  immerses you into ancient Tibetan culture. The movie was more professionally produced than I expected. It would have been nice to have the characters less one dimensional and fleshed out more.  However, the casting and acting was good.

I enjoyed the early part of Milarepa's life story, but was more interested in his life as the disciple of a great master. It was disappointing to find at the end of the move that this part would be told in a sequel. However, after reading that part 2 was planned for 2009, I figured that it would be available (in 2015). With a little research, I discovered that the sequel was never made.

People interested in Buddhism (or spiritual practice in general) will probably find this historical movie worth watching. Just be aware that it ends at the point where he repents and decides to seek spiritual liberation.",1441152000,3,1069,4.97191011235955

The effects are there to serve the tale and not overdone. This is as far away from a hollywood film as one can get yet is as good as the best indie dramatic films. I suspect part two is delayed for lack of funding as this story probably appeals to a limited number of people.

Unfortunately the film does not take the story of this great Tibetan saint far enough and it does not show how Milarepa manages to overcome all of his obstacles/ignorance/ negative karma and accomplishes what most people can not accomplish in one lifetime.

2951835,4,B000VSPN4O,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 Milarepa (2006) is an interesting Tibetan film chronicling segments from the life of a Tibetan yogi, Thopaga / Milarepa, who lived in the 11th century in western Tibet, who was born into a wealthy family but on the death of his father, was robbed of his inheritance by his father's greedy family. His mother complains about suffering throughout the film but to the viewer, she really doesn't have it that bad, it seems like she only longs for more wealth. Hence the universal themes of vengeance and yearning dictate her motives and disposition. She influences her son Thopaga / Milarepa to study sorcery to inflict revenge on his father's greedy family, leaving his female companion, who is quite beautiful.

The first half of the film is quite good and simple in nature, familiar conflicts play a vital theme. The landscape is absolutely stunning and the low key, natural realism of the actors is very momentous.

The film loses some of its impetus when it delves into silly Computer-generated imagery during the sorcery scenes. These could have been left out altogether, and insinuations, inferences, and basic camera tricks would have sufficed much better to keep it resembling an elementary human drama. The silly Computer-generated imagery knocks the sorcery scenes down to a ""sword and sorcery"" Hollywood look-alike.

I enjoyed it though and it was capable if you are intrigued by foreign films. In all, it is an above average film that imparts a universal common, human leitmotif, that is of human meaning and human predicaments.",1389225600,2,1580,5.038314176245211
2951836,4,B000VSPN4O,This story is about a young man that seeks revenge for a wrong done to his family. He gets his revenge but has to pay for it. The culture and scenic cinematography make the story worthwhile. The plot grabs your attention and manages to hold on throughout. The lesson is learned.,1378598400,,278,4.470588235294118

2951838,3,B000VSPN4O,I would've given this a higher rating if I had known that it was not the FULL story of Milarepa. There is nowhere in the description where it says this is only Part 1. The movie ends with saying there is Part 2 coming but it doesn't seem to exist! Besides that the production of the movie is good.,1364774400,,297,4.0508474576271185
2951839,5,B000VSPN4O,"To start off, I'll mention what many others already have: the story is split in two and this is only the first part. The frustrating thing about this is not that you have to wait but that a specific year was given (2009) for its release and yet one cannot find Any information about it anywhere - unless you count dozens of people asking where it is as information. I don't hold this against the first half but it is annoying that there is no way to predict when or if the director will finish the story.

That said, I must admit that this movie was extraordinarily well done. It is not incredible by Hollywood standards and it has the distinctive feel of a heavy foreign film, so if you are expecting something different then look elsewhere. However, it is great for what it is: a subtle story that is meant to reflect elements of human nature and Tibetan culture. The movie does not rely heavily on special effects, violence, or even music, rather it is interaction between actors and the natural background that allow the movie to express its messages. There are periods of silence throughout many scenes, something that I appreciated because I felt it added a necessary depth to the dialogue - at the same time, if you do not care for silence based conversations it could be a downside to the film. There are a few scenes that people often criticized for taking away the naturalness of the movie by using special effects but I did not feel that they worsened the film: they were kept to a minimum, weren't focused on, and personally I cannot imagine the film without them. The thing I liked most about the movie was the film location and the authenticity that it had. Milarepa was filmed in Bhutan, a country that has only recently opened up to the modern world and actively works to maintain its Tibetan culture by limiting visitors. For this reason the film had access to locations, tools, and buildings that seem ancient yet authentic. The director did such a good job that it was not until the movie was over that I realized the challenge that would be inherent in filming a movie based in a time so distant from our own - it drew me in so well that it didn't occur to me to question it.

In all the movie was a subtle and effective storytelling of a celebrated Tibetan tale. It did an incredible job at expressing the messages, finding suitable actors, and maintaining the Tibetan culture inherent in the tale.",1356825600,6,2419,4.52054794520548

2951848,4,B000VSPN4O,"Filmed in the Spiti Valley on the Indian-Tibetan border, this award winning film tells the story of the first half of Milarepa's life (1052-1135), whose path to enlightenment began with revenge. A second movie is planned to complete the story.

When his well-to-do merchant father died, Milarepa's uncle and aunt took all the family's wealth, suddenly thrusting Milarepa and his mother into poverty. His mother plots revenge by sending Milarepa away to study sorcery. Milarepa comes back to the village and causes a violent lightning storm to kill many people.

When the villagers chase him, Milarepa causes large rocks to fall from a ridge blocking their way. As he escapes Milarepa meets an old monk, and learns of Buddha's teachings. Milarepa returns to his sorcery teacher, who advises him to study with Marpa. The film ends with Milarepa seeking Marpa.

The landscape is stark and beautiful. The special effects are quite well done - I especially liked the scene where Milarepa gains mastery in sorcery, a bit like a Pink Floyd psychedelic trip from the 60s. My favourite scene was when Milarepa meets an old monk while escaping from the villagers, and sits quietly with old Buddhist paintings all around him on the wall. You can feel that his redemption is at hand.

As companions to this movie, I highly recommend reading a book about his life such as The Magnificent Trickster - The Story Of Milarepa by Molly MacGregor, and some of his teachings like in the book Milarepa: Songs On The Spot by Nicole Riggs.",1254268800,20,1516,4.88715953307393

I have written Milarepa's story elsewhere before, there are actually more inspiring, touching, and uplifting stories of him when he began cultivation. Unfortunately, this is not captured in this movie. May be we'll see a sequel?

This also reminds me of today's Milarepas, millions of practitioners of Falun Dafa (Falun Gong). They are truly remarkable as well, overcoming great tribulations and offering salvation to sentient beings, in light of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance, the fundamental characteristics of the universe and the ultimate in Buddha Fa ([...] If you have not heard about it, check it out, you will love it.

2951851,2,B000VSPN4O,"With enough elements for a first rate secular fantasy - a family squabble over inheritance, thievery, murder, revenge, and sorcery -  the story of Buddhist saint Milarepa could have been a great movie.  Unfortunately, it's not.  Not even close.  It is instead a plodding film that suggests little of magic and even less of the spiritual.

As presented in broad strokes by first time Bhutanese director Neten Chokling, the story of one of Tibet's greatest saints is reduced to its bare outlines - the evil relatives who usurp Milarepa's inheritance and leave his family in poverty, his mother's dream of revenge, Milarepa's training in the dark arts, his revenge on his relatives, and his eventual turn to Buddhism to alleviate his guilt.

Very little of the story is fleshed out.  We don't understand how Milarepa's uncle is able with impunity to confiscate his brother's wealth, nor why his wife continues to live in her brother-in-law's home, even though her family has been reduced to near beggary.  Are there no other family members or villagers to speak on their behalf?  Why is the uncle is so villainous to his sister-in-law and her children?  How is he able to silence an entire village?

Milarepa's mother seems like the typical self-effacing Asian woman and the actress who plays her brings such quiet reserve to the part it's hard to believe her turn into the spiteful harpy who drives her son to learn sorcery and threatens to kill herself unless he makes the uncle suffer.

We never learn what Milarepa thinks about all this.  He moves around as directed by the other players.  For a character with so little self-motivation, the actor who plays him turns in a surprisingly appropriate performance.  From beginning to end he maintains the same confused and slightly open-mouthed expression.

While the story has great mythical qualities, the film is shot in a fairly straightforward manner.  Director Chokling and his director of photography Paul J Warren have in the mountain scenery of India's Himmachal Pradesh a magnificent setting, one that in it's soaring peaks and vast empty landscapes suggests a world rich in the supernatural.  Very little else does.  There are some fairly simple special effects - levitating rocks, running at high speeds, the conjuring of a storm - but no great panning shots, no off-centered camera angles, no filters, fuzzy edges, or high contrast.

Besides being a fairly pedestrian take on the legend of Milarepa, the film is also at times something of a disappointment for missed opportunities.  Director Chokling is a Buddhist lama, a person of some scriptural and spiritual authority, who should be using what opportunities he has to again remind the world of the Chinese occupation of Tibet.  With a little finesses and sensitivity, the thieving uncle ruining Milarepa's fatherless family could have been written as the Chinese taking advantage of the leaderless Tibetans.

If you know absolutely nothing about Milarepa, this might be an interesting place to start learning something about him.  It's certainly a better film version than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006-Taiwanese-production-from-director-Sonam-Rinpoche/dp/B000VSPN4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006 Taiwanese production from director Sonam Rinpoche</a>.  Still, you'd likely learn more from some of the more interesting written accounts, plus you'd get the full story.  The film takes the viewer up only until Milarepa's decision to seek a Buddhist master.  The second part of the story is scheduled for a 2009 sequel.

3186281,3,B000VSPN4O,"The ""Life of Milarepa"" is a religious classic, a very inspiring hagiographic biography of Tibet's beloved spiritual master and poet. Sonam Tulku's film is an earnest but flawed attempt to portray this on screen. I am guessing that a low budget, and its Taiwanese production, probably precluded it being made in Nepal, Bhutan, or anywhere resembling Tibet; moveover there were many anachronisms, such as bandits having rifles (in the 11th century!), porcelain bowls instead of wooden Tibetan-style ones, modern rugs and locks, etc. The action is very slow, and potentially dramatic scenes (such as the hailstorm destroying Milarepa's village) are alluded to but not shown (budget, again). Only the first part of Milarepa's life is shown, and none of his striking songs or profound teachings are presented. There is another film of the same name coming out, by the director of ""The Cup,"" filmed in the Himalayan region of India--hopefully, it will be able to do better justice to this wonderful story. On the positive side, there is some lovely scenary (Mysore? Taiwain?), fine amateur actors, and a wholly accurate-seeming although somewhat ""cleaned-up"" portrayal of traditional Tibetan life.",1191369600,3,1191,5.340425531914893

3186332,4,B000VSPN4O,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 Milarepa (2006) is an interesting Tibetan film chronicling segments from the life of a Tibetan yogi, Thopaga / Milarepa, who lived in the 11th century in western Tibet, who was born into a wealthy family but on the death of his father, was robbed of his inheritance by his father's greedy family. His mother complains about suffering throughout the film but to the viewer, she really doesn't have it that bad, it seems like she only longs for more wealth. Hence the universal themes of vengeance and yearning dictate her motives and disposition. She influences her son Thopaga / Milarepa to study sorcery to inflict revenge on his father's greedy family, leaving his female companion, who is quite beautiful.

The first half of the film is quite good and simple in nature, familiar conflicts play a vital theme. The landscape is absolutely stunning and the low key, natural realism of the actors is very momentous.

The film loses some of its impetus when it delves into silly Computer-generated imagery during the sorcery scenes. These could have been left out altogether, and insinuations, inferences, and basic camera tricks would have sufficed much better to keep it resembling an elementary human drama. The silly Computer-generated imagery knocks the sorcery scenes down to a ""sword and sorcery"" Hollywood look-alike.

I enjoyed it though and it was capable if you are intrigued by foreign films. In all, it is an above average film that imparts a universal common, human leitmotif, that is of human meaning and human predicaments.",1389225600,2,1580,5.038314176245211

3186335,3,B000VSPN4O,I would've given this a higher rating if I had known that it was not the FULL story of Milarepa. There is nowhere in the description where it says this is only Part 1. The movie ends with saying there is Part 2 coming but it doesn't seem to exist! Besides that the production of the movie is good.,1364774400,,297,4.0508474576271185
3186336,5,B000VSPN4O,"To start off, I'll mention what many others already have: the story is split in two and this is only the first part. The frustrating thing about this is not that you have to wait but that a specific year was given (2009) for its release and yet one cannot find Any information about it anywhere - unless you count dozens of people asking where it is as information. I don't hold this against the first half but it is annoying that there is no way to predict when or if the director will finish the story.

That said, I must admit that this movie was extraordinarily well done. It is not incredible by Hollywood standards and it has the distinctive feel of a heavy foreign film, so if you are expecting something different then look elsewhere. However, it is great for what it is: a subtle story that is meant to reflect elements of human nature and Tibetan culture. The movie does not rely heavily on special effects, violence, or even music, rather it is interaction between actors and the natural background that allow the movie to express its messages. There are periods of silence throughout many scenes, something that I appreciated because I felt it added a necessary depth to the dialogue - at the same time, if you do not care for silence based conversations it could be a downside to the film. There are a few scenes that people often criticized for taking away the naturalness of the movie by using special effects but I did not feel that they worsened the film: they were kept to a minimum, weren't focused on, and personally I cannot imagine the film without them. The thing I liked most about the movie was the film location and the authenticity that it had. Milarepa was filmed in Bhutan, a country that has only recently opened up to the modern world and actively works to maintain its Tibetan culture by limiting visitors. For this reason the film had access to locations, tools, and buildings that seem ancient yet authentic. The director did such a good job that it was not until the movie was over that I realized the challenge that would be inherent in filming a movie based in a time so distant from our own - it drew me in so well that it didn't occur to me to question it.

In all the movie was a subtle and effective storytelling of a celebrated Tibetan tale. It did an incredible job at expressing the messages, finding suitable actors, and maintaining the Tibetan culture inherent in the tale.",1356825600,6,2419,4.52054794520548

3186345,4,B000VSPN4O,"Filmed in the Spiti Valley on the Indian-Tibetan border, this award winning film tells the story of the first half of Milarepa's life (1052-1135), whose path to enlightenment began with revenge. A second movie is planned to complete the story.

When his well-to-do merchant father died, Milarepa's uncle and aunt took all the family's wealth, suddenly thrusting Milarepa and his mother into poverty. His mother plots revenge by sending Milarepa away to study sorcery. Milarepa comes back to the village and causes a violent lightning storm to kill many people.

When the villagers chase him, Milarepa causes large rocks to fall from a ridge blocking their way. As he escapes Milarepa meets an old monk, and learns of Buddha's teachings. Milarepa returns to his sorcery teacher, who advises him to study with Marpa. The film ends with Milarepa seeking Marpa.

The landscape is stark and beautiful. The special effects are quite well done - I especially liked the scene where Milarepa gains mastery in sorcery, a bit like a Pink Floyd psychedelic trip from the 60s. My favourite scene was when Milarepa meets an old monk while escaping from the villagers, and sits quietly with old Buddhist paintings all around him on the wall. You can feel that his redemption is at hand.

This also reminds me of today's Milarepas, millions of practitioners of Falun Dafa (Falun Gong). They are truly remarkable as well, overcoming great tribulations and offering salvation to sentient beings, in light of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance, the fundamental characteristics of the universe and the ultimate in Buddha Fa ([...] If you have not heard about it, check it out, you will love it.

3186348,2,B000VSPN4O,"With enough elements for a first rate secular fantasy - a family squabble over inheritance, thievery, murder, revenge, and sorcery -  the story of Buddhist saint Milarepa could have been a great movie.  Unfortunately, it's not.  Not even close.  It is instead a plodding film that suggests little of magic and even less of the spiritual.

As presented in broad strokes by first time Bhutanese director Neten Chokling, the story of one of Tibet's greatest saints is reduced to its bare outlines - the evil relatives who usurp Milarepa's inheritance and leave his family in poverty, his mother's dream of revenge, Milarepa's training in the dark arts, his revenge on his relatives, and his eventual turn to Buddhism to alleviate his guilt.

Very little of the story is fleshed out.  We don't understand how Milarepa's uncle is able with impunity to confiscate his brother's wealth, nor why his wife continues to live in her brother-in-law's home, even though her family has been reduced to near beggary.  Are there no other family members or villagers to speak on their behalf?  Why is the uncle is so villainous to his sister-in-law and her children?  How is he able to silence an entire village?

Milarepa's mother seems like the typical self-effacing Asian woman and the actress who plays her brings such quiet reserve to the part it's hard to believe her turn into the spiteful harpy who drives her son to learn sorcery and threatens to kill herself unless he makes the uncle suffer.

We never learn what Milarepa thinks about all this.  He moves around as directed by the other players.  For a character with so little self-motivation, the actor who plays him turns in a surprisingly appropriate performance.  From beginning to end he maintains the same confused and slightly open-mouthed expression.

While the story has great mythical qualities, the film is shot in a fairly straightforward manner.  Director Chokling and his director of photography Paul J Warren have in the mountain scenery of India's Himmachal Pradesh a magnificent setting, one that in it's soaring peaks and vast empty landscapes suggests a world rich in the supernatural.  Very little else does.  There are some fairly simple special effects - levitating rocks, running at high speeds, the conjuring of a storm - but no great panning shots, no off-centered camera angles, no filters, fuzzy edges, or high contrast.

Besides being a fairly pedestrian take on the legend of Milarepa, the film is also at times something of a disappointment for missed opportunities.  Director Chokling is a Buddhist lama, a person of some scriptural and spiritual authority, who should be using what opportunities he has to again remind the world of the Chinese occupation of Tibet.  With a little finesses and sensitivity, the thieving uncle ruining Milarepa's fatherless family could have been written as the Chinese taking advantage of the leaderless Tibetans.

If you know absolutely nothing about Milarepa, this might be an interesting place to start learning something about him.  It's certainly a better film version than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006-Taiwanese-production-from-director-Sonam-Rinpoche/dp/B000VSPN4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006 Taiwanese production from director Sonam Rinpoche</a>.  Still, you'd likely learn more from some of the more interesting written accounts, plus you'd get the full story.  The film takes the viewer up only until Milarepa's decision to seek a Buddhist master.  The second part of the story is scheduled for a 2009 sequel.
