As a musician-in-training myself (I study cello), I try to seek out inspiration from great artists and performances such as this.  I admit to having a significant Kremer bias -- he's my favorite violinist.  I love the way he pushes the boundaries and breaks the conventions of acceptable tone, concert programs, etc.  Something else that stood out to me was how these musicians didn't take themselves or the music too seriously -- they have fun with it!  Just look at the men's fun colors of bowties, the frequent smiles from the players and glances at each other, the way the timpanist plays with the sticks of the mallets, the humorous cadenzas.

This concert is no exception, and the whole group brought impeccable technique, love of the music, energy, and a sense of humor.  I always love to see musicians smiling as they play!! :)  The unity and rapport of Kremerata Baltica was evident and so much fun to watch.

This was actually my first exposure to each piece on the program.  I mostly picked out the DVD because a friend urged me to listen to the Sinfonia Concertante, and I was not disappointed.  This a very beautiful and complete work by Mozart that was engaging from start to finish.  I thought that Kremer and Ulijona complemented each other nicely, although there were a few moments where she didn't quite match his bowing technique.  However, I liked how each of them brought a slightly different, individual style to the piece for a harmonious partnership.

The next work on the program was quite the curiosity!  The instrumentation is quite odd: 2 violins, viola, bass, timpani and string orchestra.  You can see the musicians having so much fun as they play this piece!  The way the soloists interact with each other and with the rest of the ensemble is brilliant.  And just wait for the humorous cadenzas in the rondo . . . !  I won't spoil the surprise for you, but you're in for a treat.  The encore to this piece was also quite hilarious and enjoyable.

The tail end of the program dives into two contemporary works by friends and collaborators of Kremer.  Prt's ""Mozart-Adagio"" was a beautiful re-imagining of an adagio from a piano sonata.  As the booklet article explains, the composer took the original brief dissonances of Mozart and lengthened those moments, plumbing the depths of pain therein.  It is a very fitting elegy for Oleg Kagan.  I absolutely loved the interplay between Kremer and cellist Sudraba -- they had such unified, achingly lyrical playing.  The piano part felt like a distant commentary, a tenuous connection to the original real world of Mozart.  The unconventional lighting added to the drama.

Without pause, all the lights go out and the musicians start playing odd murmuring figures with fragments of Mozart still identifiable.  Yep, ""Moz-Art  la Haydn"" is quintessential Schnittke!  His style is obviously not to everyone's taste, but I thoroughly enjoyed this piece, even more than some other less-accessiblie Schnittke works I've heard.  I think it is a genius piece of tragicomedy, perhaps in the same way as Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"".  This piece mixes serious tones with jaunty, humorous interludes.  I was quite impressed by violinist Nemanyte!  She was every bit Kremer's equal and played with real fire.  Surprises abound . . . I'll let you see what I mean!

Overall, I found inspiration in this video.  Music should be fun, and also serious at times.  Music can take us to another place, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a real place.  Music allows us to plumb the depths of human emotions in a safe and meaningful way.  These extraordinary artists achieved all of that and more in this concert.  Their high level of preparation, technique, passion, and improvisatory fun elevated each work on the program.

I can highly recommend that you buy this disc! :)",1482105600,,3968,4.85096870342772
8246704,5,B0012L2KBS,"Gidon Kremer is somewhat younger than I am, which means we are both older men (wiser, too, perhaps). I have followed his career since its beginnings, and honestly he has never given a poor, or false, or lazy performance. His commitment to music and his devotion to composers are the ne plus ultra of classical music. This is the level of musicianship that will save classical music from being overwhelmed by the sheer riot of competing music. And I would add only because of this excellence of the performers making such an eloquent case for it does classical music deserve to survive. Enough said. Now to the music. For me the essential work on this generous recording is the Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364, written about the time of his breakthrough opera, IDOMENEO.
This double concerto is Mozart at his most graceful, inventive, beguiling and, yes, profound. This strikes me as music that derives from the Heart Chakra, and goes directly into the listener's. If you are a decent human being, not a saint or a hero, just a good person, this music will reward you by lifting your spirit, cleansing your soul, delighting your mind and making the rest of the day celebratory. Yes, this is all true. Music that comes from the Heart Chakra of which Mozart was a master has this spiritual effect. You only have to open your ears, concentrate on the waves of gorgeous sounds, receive the music and you are the best possible self you are capable of being. How long will this blessed condition last? I cannot presume to predict something so variable and personal. So - when this is finished, listen to Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 or Symphony No. 40 or - well, you get my drift. Maestro Kremer, let the music take over!",1415404800,4,1713,4.675496688741722
8246705,5,B0012L2KBS,"This disc contains works with a Mozartian theme and contains items recorded at Salzburg in 2002. It also features Kremer's own orchestra which he created as a celebration of his 50th birthday and which consists of a group of young and fine eastern European players known as Kremerata Baltica. The booklet has an article entitled `Moz-Art: a carnival evening in Kremerland'. This basically sets the scene for this rather unusual but very enjoyable disc.

Kremer himself has a reputation both as a fine virtuoso violinist and also as a bit of a maverick. This is in the sense that he delights in stretching some of the boundaries. Examples might be the use of an unusual cadenza, such as we have here, or an extension into unusual repertoire, which we also have here. There is frequently the feeling that there is a sense of humour at work as well as an investigative mind - hence `Kremerland'. All of these aspects can be experienced on this disc.

The disc starts with a fine and lively performance of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola. Kremer is joined in this performance by Ola Ulijona who matches Kremer very well in what is essentially a straightforward performance. This is followed by the Serenata Notturna which strays off the straight and narrow with some diverting musical asides and unusual mini-cadenzas for double bass and also for timpani (played with the wooden handles to give an appropriately crisp and military sound). I found this very entertaining.

The encore for that concert features a totally amusing parody by Teddy Bor and entitled `McMozart's Eine kliene bricht Moonlicht Nicht Musik' where various Scottish items are skilfully interwoven with original Mozart. This short piece is the perfect encore and greatly amused the audience.

The remaining two items come from another concert and are quite different - very serious. The Arvo Part composition' Mozart-Adagio' is a reworking of a piano sonata slow movement with extended dissonances and was written in memory of a recently deceased friend. I personally found it an effective composition and successful on its own terms. The remaining piece by Schnittke, `Moz-Art a la Haydn', was not so successful for me. This starts with an improvisory section played by the musicians in complete darkness and which continues when the lights come on again in a sound world that I simply do not inhabit. This is a personal opinion and will therefore not affect the final rating.

The whole disc is well recorded with crisp imaging in good colour and with involving camera work which captures the changing moods of the two occasions. The sound is clearly recorded and is presented in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and stereo.

This, in my opinion, is a most enjoyable collection of pieces and should appeal to anyone who is prepared to go with Kremer and his orchestra and explore a bit off the main pathways. For me, I feel that it fully justifies a 5 star rating on those terms.",1343001600,3,2949,4.8997995991983965
