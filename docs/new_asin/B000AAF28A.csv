If you realize that we all call each other names anyway and that stereoptypes are meant to be talked about so we can break them down, then get this DVD and laugh your F*!<3n a** off in the process!!!",1129161600,,371,4.515151515151516

2383778,5,B000AAF28A,"Lisa Lampanelli lets it all hang out here.  The humor is ethnic but done in fun, and the audience has many ethnic people laughing at themselves and the racial stereotypes she is saying.  Sex is also a big part of her act.  People that have never heard Lisa usually go nuts, they cant believe what they are hearing while they are rolling on the floor laughing.  I have seen her in person a few times, and this dvd captures the essense of a real good show.  If you want to laugh and don't easily get offended, you gotta buy this dvd.",1128211200,,531,4.217821782178218
2383779,5,B000AAF28A,"This is one of the funniest stand-up shows I've ever seen. Lisa Lampanelli -- the proclaimed ""Queen Of Mean"" -- keeps the jokes running at break-neck speed, with all of them being hilarious. Just be warned, she doesn't get the nickname for nothing. Amazon.com shows this DVD as rated PG. I have suspicions that is false information. There is plenty of adult language to go around, and the subject of most of her material is very racy for children. Not only is ""Take It Like A Man"" extremely questionable for young viewers, but undeniably questionable for the easily-offended. She has a great sense of humor, and the majority of it revolves around making fun of certain types of people. As her saying goes, ""It is fun to make fun of everybody"". She shoves it to white people, black people, gay people, hispanic people, christians, muslims, jews, and much more. If you are at all proud of who you are and can't take a joke, avoid Lisa Lampanelli! This is raw, mean humor, intended to bring us together by laughing at ourselves. A fine job she does at that. Just don't be taken by surprise when you find yourself laughing to death over completely politically incorrect jokes that are sure to make even the meanest of comedians blush.",1126569600,35,1230,4.6728110599078345

2383788,5,B000AAF28A,"At first my views of ""LL"" were not very endearing, but after watching two of her specials and having seen her numerous times on the various Comedy Central Roasts, I have acquired an affinity for her.  She's brilliant and so underrated.  If you are easily offended or have a thin skin, she's simply not for you.  If on the other hand, you enjoy a good zinger at your own expense or at the expense of another, you will love her.  Long Live The Queen!!!",1300665600,,450,4.321428571428571

2383791,5,B000AAF28A,"This is the funniest stand up comedy ever! You just need to view it with a open mind and good sense of humor, people criticize her for being racist, but her act is more of a parody of racist people, she wants you to see how ridiculous stereotype and racism really look like. She includes everyone and no minority group is left out.",1271980800,,331,4.26984126984127

2383793,1,B000AAF28A,"I saw a snippet of this comedian on you tube. I thought she was hilarious.  So, I bought this CD. I was a little disappointed in it because I felt she was a too vulgar and that she spent too much time talking about her sex life.  Parts of it were funny, but too much of it was not, in my opinion.",1241222400,4,296,3.7580645161290325

2383796,3,B000AAF28A,"I had high hopes for this DVD after seeing Lisa on the Comedy Central Roasts, but this wasn't as funny or clever as I thought it would be.  The DVD is 60 minutes with no bonus features, and her material was literally like 5 minutes of jokes buried under 55 min of insults, often-repeated and vulgar.  Not that I mind dirty language, I just like there to be SOME substance behind all the foul talk.  If you've seen her Comedy Central roasts, you've pretty much gotten the essence of this DVD - only buy it if you're a BIG fan of hers and aren't expecting a lot of clever writing or huge pile of actual JOKES jokes.",1237075200,4,613,4.222222222222222

2383804,5,B000AAF28A,"Lisa Lampanelli is easily one of the funniest people working the comedy circuit today.

2383806,5,B000AAF28A,"I've watched this at least half a dozen times and love it each and every time. Lisa Lampanelli's a crude, rude insult comic, so her brand of comedy is not for everyone, but if you're willing to accept and enjoy her brash type of humor, you'll love her performance. Her timing, facial expressions and Jersey Italian accent all make her talent truly priceless.  There were about 10 bits that had me and my partner laughing to the point of tears.",1194739200,,443,4.5375

2383808,4,B000AAF28A,"I like Lisa. I think she's funny, and I remember comedy in the days when we weren't all afraid of our own shadows and ""offending"" someone. If you can't see this woman's heart through the coarse humor, nothing I have to say will convince you. Don Rickles WASN'T...and STILL ISN'T...a bigot, and neither is Lisa. One of the ways to take ALL of the power away from intolerance and bigotry is to laugh at it, to make it the very SUBJECT of ridicule. Rickles GOT IT. Lisa GETS it. I like Lisa, and maybe you will too.",1179273600,3,512,4.288659793814433

2383810,5,B000AAF28A,"Ms. Lampanelli's brand of humor is uncomfortable, but it is devastatingly funny.  In this short stand-up comedy disc, she manages to insult every race without offending them.  Not for the faint-hearted.",1170806400,9,202,5.483870967741935

2383812,5,B000AAF28A,"I bought this dvd as a gift for my best friend. We laughed so hard. Everyone was fair game in her humor.

It's too bad this show only comes on rarely on the weekend and at like midnight because it's so raunchy.

2383817,5,B000AAF28A,"After watching this my jaw ached for a day!  I really wasn't prepared for what I heard, but holy cow, it was teriffic!!

Lisa is definetely the Queen of Trash Talk.  Her delivery is fresh and wonderful; and just when you think she has completed the punchline, she turns out a new one, ripping the rug from underneath you.  Excellent performance and a must buy.

Note:  Every reviewer is correct in saying ""Buyer Beware"".  This material, although not the most offensive I have encountered, is right up there.  Just be prepared to hear things you only think, but would never say aloud.  You'll enjoy this much more if you get in that mindset.",1147737600,3,640,4.592920353982301
2383818,5,B000AAF28A,"I believe that Ms. Lampanelli has picked the wrong vocation. Her talents are, frankly, wasted in the entertainment world. Upon hearing her, I could not help but imagine her sitting at an international round table, instructing diplomats on what, exactly, they could do WITH THEIR FREAKING FOREIGN POLICIES! Or, hosting her own self-help show, giving people helpful instruction on HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR PATHETIC *^%$ING LIVES! Yes, Ms. Lampanelli owes it to the world to share her gifts with those other than us weak souls willing--eager!-- to listen to arguably the best comic in 40 years while drinking unconscionable quantities of alcholic beverages and feeling up our dates in public. See ""Take It Like A Man"". You owe it to yourself. ""Life is short. Eat Desert First."" You will NOT be sorry, you stupid *%^$.",1146441600,2,816,5.007352941176471
2383819,4,B000AAF28A,"I saw Miss Lampanelli on The Tonight Show (other guest was Simon Cowell). We get Leno here on MNBC - a few days after the actual broadcast. I thought she was hilarious and immediately ordered both her shows. I watched this one first and loved it. If you like humour and stand-up, this is DEFINITELY a DVD to add to your collection. BUT. There is a big fat BUT. Don't buy her other show on DVD, even if you love this one. It is called ""The Queen of Mean"", and the audio and visual standards are pathetic and amateurish! I am not making this up or trying to be harsh - but it looks like a pirated copy from China. And the saddest thing was that she did almost the EXACT same material in that show as she did in this show. Hence 4 stars and not 5. A lot of the things I laughed at on LENO also resurfaced in this act. Quite ironic that the word IMPROV is clearly visible above the stage through most of the show. But back to compliments - her lines and delivery are VERY funny, that's for sure! I hope this information helped with your decision.",1145491200,23,1042,4.137931034482759
2383820,5,B000AAF28A,One word - wow - she had me laughing from beginning to end.  Her comedy is shocking yet refreshing in a world that is so uptight.

This is the most hysterical female comic on the planet ! Lisa is the gal that would be cool to hang out with the guys at the bar and really have a wild time at karaoke night. Her humor is definitley not for the sensitive,squeamish, meek & mild, faint of heart, etc. etc. I'll tell you who she is for though; People who want to laugh and can appreciate adult raunchy humor at it's hysterical, almost-wet-your-pants best ! She's on the ball and has that gifted knack for quick snappy comebacks, great pacing or timing;the jokes and lines just fly at an alarming speed and are aplenty! She doesn't miss a beat at all. She's an equal opportunity gal and won't leave anybody out from the audience. Gives everybody a fair shake. You will even catch Lisa Lampanelli snickering and snorting or chortling to her own jokes or observations (trying to stifle her own laughter);that's cause she KNOWS her material is awesome! I highly recommend this for the open minded and for those who want to just have a great time sharing this with friends (of the same humor, that is) ! ...

BTW, even if this is or isn't available on audio cd, you have to watch the dvd format to really appreciate the hilarious facial expressions/ character contortions,body movements,ethnic accents this woman creates when she's really into her routine. Just for her expressions is worth the price of admisson alone !",1139356800,5,1570,4.684782608695652
