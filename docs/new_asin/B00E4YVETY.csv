5890728,3,B00E4YVETY,"Having been a fan of Jess Franco for quite a while now there was no way I was going to miss this steamy Severin blu ray release.
An AMAZING job was done in compiling interviews, restoring footage and even finding the non English speaking 'HARD BANANA' version that I viewed after watching the restored blu ray version of the film.
Great insight into the relationship between Franco and his longtime muse Lina Romay whose treatment of a banana in the film is definitely worth the price! First 2500 get the extra disc 'HARD BANANA' version so don't hesitate...",1384128000,6,558,4.704081632653061
5890729,4,B00E4YVETY,"Great looking bluray with minor print damage & telecine wobble here and there.  It features many obvious cutaways and very little nudity IMO.  The ""hard banana cut"" featured on the limited to 2500 copies edition seems to be the real cut to me. It is the film I expected to see, with plenty of flesh on display during the sunbathing scenes and just about everywhere else (completely different takes by the way with the actors).  The hardcore scenes (very few) also feature Lina Romay, not some inserts.  I really feel this is the true cut, though the poor quality tape source hampers things quite a bit (it is anamorphic widescreen however & in French with English subs).  This reminds me a lot of Shreik Show's first attempt at Lizard in a Woman's Skin; good quality edited print, poor quality for the uncut.  Anyhow, I'm glad I was able to see it, but without the bonus disc, this might be a complete waste, despite Lina's lovely eyes often zoomed upon (Leone style) in the cut Bluray version.  I'll even go so far as to say that the film plays much better in the ""hardcore cut"" and the ending works better for me.  If anybody can offer further info about the various cuts, I'd love to know.  For now, I consider the Blu just an awkward tease & not worth owning without the bonus.  The banana rape scene doesn't exist, nor is it even eluded to on the bluray.  If you've ever read anything about this film, sorry, that's not on the Blu.  Get the limited edition while it's available.",1381363200,16,1483,4.492537313432836
5890730,4,B00E4YVETY,"Franco's 1975 domestic drama, Hot Nights of Linda, aka Brutal Nights of Linda, aka But Who Raped Linda? brought out on DVD from a recently discovered 35mm print which nevertheless shows a certain amount of wear and grain.  The print has not been cleaned up much (there are speckles and some minor scratching throughout and reel-changes are noticeable with slightly more wear) but nothing critical or major and in fact it's endearing. The rough grindhouse filminess of the presentation adds the the experience.

Marie (Arno) is sent to a mansion on an island to help an older man (Paul Muller) take care of his daughters Lina Romay (playing the nymphomaniac Olivia) and Catherine Laferiere (playing the crippled/catatonic Linda).  Family secrets ensue and a hidden trauma as well as casual and increasingly twisted sexual activities slowly unravel.

It's a fairly typical middle-period Franco with similarities to Female Vampire, Doriana Gray, and Eugenie de Sade.  The plot is minimal and loose and stream-of-consciousness: Arno basically shows up to talk, watch, be seduced and sunbathe.  The film presages his slower atmospheric and dream-like Golden Films from the '80s.  Linda is moody and erotic, mostly due to the naked flesh on display and Arno's gaze. The camera loves her and she knows how to simply watch, as we do.  The stunning Spanish location and the house in which it's shot also looks beautiful and tactile with its textures, stone details and plaster walls and plants.  A slowburn of perversion and dread permeates.  Franco uses some artistic lighting and effects, and there's a great (apparent) post-coital scene between Romay and Arno where Romay explains something while smoking and leaning against a doorframe that's bathed in red light.

Also, in spite of the wear the colors on the print look fabulous.  There are occasional focus issues and shifting lighting qualities which no doubt were due to production resources (or lack thereof) and not due to a fading or mis-timed print.  The blu-ray looks luminous even though sharpness is not great.  Arno's blonde hair particularly seems soft but it's almost an aesthetic element.  The shadows, the stone walls and steps, the white plaster and the fleshy bodies on display (no Kate Moss types for Franco) on sunny balconies all create a kind of sterile lushness that makes the film feel warm, hard and mysterious.  The DVD looks almost as good.

The intrigue leads to a couple big reveals and nice reversals as things play themselves out and the film loses interest in Arno and becomes more interested in following Romay mess with the servant and investigate her father's secret.  Without any big setpieces (no burning buildings or shootouts) the film ends in a gesture towards a suspended state of was-it-a-dream/ambiguity as to what happens next, par for Franco and effective as always.  Extras are a great mixed bag of stuff collected from various places including a filmed conversation with Romay and Franco and a short making-of conversation with Stephen Thrower and outtakes.

Also, if you order direct from the Severin site they currently have a limited edition (2500 only) edition that includes an alternate French cut, the ""Nuits brulantes de Linda/Brutal Nights of Linda"" that is sourced from video. It's pretty grainy/blurry/poor quality but there are alternate nude takes of some of the scenes and a couple added scenes of a sexual nature. The emphasis is more towards hardcore (mostly with women alone) and plays differently, replacing a comedic subplot in the ""Hot Nights..."" version with a detective taking pictures (?) for more extended naked encounters between Romay and almost every member of the cast including herself.  These long interludes loosen the plot to the point of distraction and make the film much more of a sleazy fever-dream.  It's a great (if murky) variant.  The alternate scenes were shot by Franco on the set, we're not talking about inserts that someone put in later, so while the softer ""Hot Nights..."" HD version is apparently his preferred version the ""Nuits brulantes..."" version is also a Franco-shot and worth owning for fans.

Many Franco films from this period are being issued of late, this one is a lesser-known but strong example of his sensual melodramas, Arno and Leferierre (in a somewhat thankless roll) are very good and Romay, although saddled with a pretty bad dub job in the HD version (the French variant has subtitles), is as beautiful and enthusiastic as always.",1381104000,16,4490,5.094133697135061

8601296,1,B00E4YVETY,"Boring, no music, no skin, pretentious. Jess Franco fail in this one as nothing original here. Sure, supposedly there is a plot and some sexual situations but words supposedly and situations do not  substitute in this case. Blu ray  not really perfect either. Done in about 1975 it reflect simple fact that Jess Franco is afraid to show female body.",1403654400,,349,4.8
8601297,5,B00E4YVETY,"Excellent movie, it came in three dvd. one did not work, the second was the copy after editing. Then the third was the original, and it was great, and you can tell that the editor cut the very good parts of the movie, and without it, the movie will be worth nothing, I suggest to have a copy of it, because it has all the nudity parts, close up shots. the sexploitation parts. and intercourse part. I suggest to buy it in order to watch few times, and have it in your lina Romay great sexploitation collection.",1396742400,3,510,4.268041237113402

8601299,2,B00E4YVETY,"The cut version is what you get on blu...Looks ok, but a lot of the story line is lost with all the cut scenes...The banana version is the better version, but is only standard definition and it looks terrible...Looks like your standard bootleg...I think that footage was lost and someone definitely took a video camera and set it in front of a computer monitor or TV to record it from a VHS tape..So it appears..Dark scenes are really blurry..Some day scenes are seriously washed out, there is tape roll--(You know when the vhs looses tracking and you have the ""roll"" going on..For those of you old enough to remember beta and vhs..) and the  audio is horrendous..It has a serious buzz in the audio track which is really prevalent when run through a home theater system....Hopefully someone will be able to get a good banana version released sometime, but I'm afraid this is the best we are ever going to get...",1387238400,4,911,4.658385093167702
