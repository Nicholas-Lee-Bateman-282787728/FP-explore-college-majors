2058003,4,B00023ELYG,this was such a great and fun movie.  I loved it from the moment I saw it on tv.  Roma and Eric were terrific. I have been searching for it on dvd for a year and I finally got it!!!,1127347200,10,181,3.5
2058004,5,B00023ELYG,"What can I say. Everyone that I know  has been trying to purchase this on DVD or VHS. I bought both. Normally the VHS tape is better - the reason is, it  has a full screen - too many heads get chopped off in DVDs. Roma Downey is always good in shows, the little  girl ""Chloe""  is a very good actress, as is our favorite, as always, Hector (can't spell his last name, you know the actor - Runaway Bride, Pretty Woman, etc.).

I have waited several years for this movie!!! Thanks for finally releasing  it for the  home box office.",1125878400,49,529,4.178217821782178

2058012,5,B00023ELYG,It is nice to find a great little movie with a wonderful story line that is so family-friendly. I highly recommend it.  We bought the VHS version of this movie years ago and have worn the tape out watching it.  To find it on a DVD is marvelous.,1518134400,,244,4.0625

2058015,4,B00023ELYG,"This is a favorite Christmas movie of mine, and a tradition to watch every year. I have a soft spot for Roma Downey. It is interesting to hear her try to do an American accent that fades every few sentences.

This version is different from the TV version, as it included a lot more sexual references that were cleaned up for TV. While the story is cheesy, it is still a fun watch, and you go from hating the main character to feeling for him.",1517270400,,442,4.2

There were a few twists I hadn't remembered and the story was really good, as was the acting.  The little girl was such a good actor and will win your heart.

2058026,5,B00023ELYG,"I was born when this movie came out, so I obviously watched and enjoyed it later on. We had this on VHS and I watched it over and over. We kept moving houses and I eventually lost it. Over the years I'd forgotten the title, but would think about the film from time to time. Today I found out it's been on Prime! So glad I can watch it again. It does have a couple of corny moments, and I'm just staring at the screen like , but it is overall such a heart warming movie. My day is made fr.   ugh~ and it's winter rn too   .. Thank you Amazon.",1515110400,,541,3.8468468468468466

2058037,1,B00023ELYG,Infantile storyline ... poor acting. It may be amusing to a small child of three or four at best. It lacks chemistry and believability in the characters and the plot. Even the score is twinkly and repetitive. I want to say something good ...,1514332800,,241,4.5
2058038,4,B00023ELYG,This movie is a Christmas classic for me. My mom watched it with my siblings and I when we were young and now I'm hooked.,1514332800,,121,3.88
2058039,1,B00023ELYG,"One of the worst made for tv movies I ever watched.  It starts out badly and just keeps getting worse; I only made it abut 60% through.  I like cheesy movies, but this one has really terrible acting, is beyond transparent (you can anticipate every detail), and the kid is very affected/fake, obnoxious cutesy. The heroine's kid behaves poorly, not respecting other people's things, then the mother has the nerve to criticize the guy for saying it's not acceptable/ok to step in and tell her child ""no.""  He may be ""the bad guy"" but he's also just declaring reasonable/normal boundaries, like, you may not use or destroy my stuff.  Kids can just behave badly and people have to tolerate your kids not listening and doing what they want to their stuff?  Nope, sorry, don't agree.  The kid in this is beyond annoying, and I love kids.  This movie attempts to manipulate the viewer into being charmed, but fails miserably, having the opposite effect.  The one highlight is the boss/angel actor.  Overall, this is quite a turkey.  Avoid.",1514246400,,1032,4.779661016949152

2058043,4,B00023ELYG,"A Christmas Romance with good acting. It's predictable for most of us as far as the plot goes, and with actors with a bit more chemistry, it'd have been better, but they all do well enough with it to make it believable and enjoyable. If you're looking for a decent Christmas romance that isn't too taxing, this is the movie for you.",1513987200,,332,4.370967741935484

2058055,5,B00023ELYG,Absolutely charming and even touching. My only complaint is that the leading lady looked old enough to be the bacholer's mother. Surely the makeup artist or stylist could've done something.,1513641600,,189,5.333333333333333
2058056,5,B00023ELYG,perfect condtition!,1513641600,,19,9.0
2058057,2,B00023ELYG,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't make it past the first 20 minutes of this movie.  It was so dated and fake...not an authentic feel to the story at all.  For example when the young girl runs into the rich guy's house, he doesn't even say ""Why are you in my house? Who are you?"", and it was the same thing when her mother ran into his house after her daughter.  Who just looks casually at 2 intruders with no curiosity as to what they are doing in his home?  The movie had potential, but I just didn't see it ...I'm puzzled as to the high reviews.",1513555200,,539,4.056603773584905

2058068,3,B00023ELYG,"Honestly had to skip most of the parts with the little girl. She was for the most part a spoiled, drama-causing, disobedient child. In fact, that's the only way our lovers meet, so you can tell it's pretty integral to the whole movie. Annoying voice and typical 90s cliche brat that the parents have to compensate for and fawn over. Can't believe the guy had to apologize after getting righteously upset at her messing up his stuff, and the little girl was not held accountable whatsoever. And the mom was both complicit and in denial, ""She won't mess up anything."" Couldn't stand the kid's scenes at all, it kind of tainted the whole movie. Thank goodness there's a skip ahead button.",1512864000,2,685,4.669421487603306
2058069,5,B00023ELYG,"I first saw this movie in hallmark one year at Christmas, and then never saw it or could find again on tv! I finally remembered who the actor was and googled it and had to have it on dvd since Ive been waiting for it come back in tv.

2058090,5,B00023ELYG,"Excellent acting by all, nice sets, pleasant music, you know whats going to happen but its all heart-warming anyway. It takes place during the Christmas holidays, and one of the characters may be an angel, but the religious aspects are soft-pedaled. There is simply nothing in this movie that can offend anyone, and lots that can please everyone. I didn't notice any rating, but it is suitable for a child of any age and his/her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents.

I do have one reservation, though it doesnt affect my rating. The male lead is super rich  mansion, butler, maids  so money is never an issue. For many people, money is an issue, and watching the lifestyle of the super rich can be off-putting. But hey, this is a fantasy, and a lovely one at that, so don't let that bother you.

Precocious they say? BRAT I counter. BRAT with ratty hair. I hated the kid so much that I could not stand to watch the end of the movie. Not one more second of that brat child who never did what she was told and was the kind of kid that made childless couples know they made the right decision. BRAT.

It is no surprise that the purveyors of felonious abrogations of Article XIII enslaving humans to their abusive divorce racketeering swindles find it ""necessary"" to persecute and prosecute professional substitutes in the broader world since their ""religion"" objective of inflicting human misery and subjugation denies humanity the benefits otherwise available as demonstrated in this charming film.",1499904000,,721,6.2727272727272725

2058783,5,B00023ELYG,"I want to say that this movie dvd digital video disc rocks. It's one of the greatest dvd digital video discs of all time. The reason why I say that is because this takes place at christmas time. It was filmed in christmas time so it's considered a great holiday dvd digital video disc. I just want to say the actors and actresses are Roma downey, eric McCormack and hector elizondo. This christmas, even strangers can become family. Dvd video borrowed hearts 2010 echo bridge home entertainment. The best christmas gift of all. . . Is family. Sam field ( eric McCormack, TV's will & grace), a single, powerful businessman is about to close the biggest deal of his career with industrialist Javier del campo (hector elizondo, pretty woman), a self-proclaimed family man. Problem is, sam prefers freedom to fatherhood. To impress Javier during his holiday visit, sam convinces single mom Kathleen (Roma downey, TV's touched by an angel) and her daughter, zoey, to pose as his family for cash Kathleen desperately needs. With a little christmas magic, sam learns to open his heart to the best gifts of all: love and family. At the beginning of the movie it starts out with zoey come help me Thats what the mother said for her to help her in the kitchen. Zoey come on will be late. She has to ride with her mother in the car. Then the car breaks down. Zoey has a dollhouse in her house and her dream comes true when she sees the actual dollhouse in the film. The gentleman says in the film if you don't do the crime you don't do the time. I'm sorry mommy Thats what zoey said when she got in trouble in school by making up stuff in school. Then the mother said to her daughter I guess someone doesn't want her christmas present if she keeps on misbehaving. The turning point of the story is zoeys grandmother told her you have to behave and if you behave you will have your guardian angels on your side all the time. Zoeys father abandoned her but not her mother. The father you will see later on at the very end of the film but tells zoey I love you but her real father in the story I'm referring to is that its a true film just fiction not a nonfiction story. It's just a fiction story like a make believe story like a fairy tale which is almost made up like a true movie story. But its just a story. I would like to tell you more but the amazon.com customers will have to buy the movie to see if they like it or not. I hope the amazon.com customers will buy the movie and they will really enjoy it but I'm not forcing anyone to buy this film or anything off the website its just there preference. When you buy any amazon product from the buyer amazon directly you get shipping and handling free for orders over $35.00 plus the state you lived in you might have to pay a state tax.",1398124800,,2779,4.325670498084291

FFF is the group that puts out movies and cuts what they deem inappropriate.  I know some people like that and thats okay, really.  If you like the cut version, great, but let us know it's been cut!  I'm not a big fan of FFF (sorry, I'm not).  I find their films boring and hacked up.  So, if you like the cut version, stick with FFF.  If not, stear clear of FFF versions.

What I like about this movie:
1) It is entertaining.
2) No gratuitous obscene language or sex.  I am not against either (I like girls and I swear) but I don't like movies that depend on these for customers at the expense of plot, acting, etc.
3) This can be watched with children, your self-righteous friends, your mother-in-law and your too correct, straight laced aunt.",1350864000,3,612,4.638888888888889

It's a lovely romance which begins as a business proposition, and Roma Downey is both luminous and no-nonsense as a single mom doing her best to give her daughter a good life against very trying circumstances.  Eric McCormack is also good as her boss, and you can easily see his future star rising.  And who can forget the always fabulous Hector Elizondo who seems to be able to inhabit every character he's ever played, even an angel!

2058956,5,B00023ELYG,"Made-for-TV movies tend to be really corny or try to force Christmas cheer. Borrowed Hearts actually succeeds. The relationship between Sam Field (Eric McCormack) and the little girl Zoey works really well. They share a moment as they reminisce over how they've struggled to satisfy their parents expectations. McCormack is very convincing as his character learns the value of spending Christmas with the family. The love between Kathleen (Roma Downey) and Field is a bit forced, but is somewhat believable and is probably the weakest part in an otherwise undervalues Christmas movie.",1322352000,,584,5.358695652173913
2058957,5,B00023ELYG,"This is one of my favorite holiday season movies.  For years, I tried to catch it on TV, and even once was able to record it onto VHS, so I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I can't say exactly what it is, but the mix is right, with a man who is caught up in trying to run the business he inherited from his father, a woman who wants to make ends meet without her daughter missing the father than left them, and a little girl who just wants a real home.  While ""pretending"" to be a family, each seems to find something they need through the others. Hector Elizondo, as the visiting businessman, adds just the right touch.",1320796800,2,629,4.097560975609756
2058958,5,B00023ELYG,"This movie was enchanting and heartwarming the first time I caught its initial airing on TV, and I wait for it to appear on cable every year since.  How can you resist a rags-to-riches story involving characters who truly deserve it, and the magical, warm feeling you come away with after viewing it?  It's funny how the poorest character was Sam Field (played by Will and Grace's Eric McCormack) until an angel posing as a Mexican businessman (Hector Elizondo, who is great in everything he plays) brings him together with his plant employee, Kathleen (beautiful Roma Downey), and her little girl Zoey (Sorry, didn't catch her real name!).

Kathleen is a poor, single working mother with a child to raise and a deadbeat, golf fanatical ex-husband who only cares for himself.  She needs a safer place to raise her daughter and her car is literally on its last wheels.  Sam is a wealthy businessman who understandably attracts lots of women, but he is bankrupt inside because of the emotional damage his father inflicted upon him as a kid.  When big family man Senor Del Campo insists on doing business with only like-minded clients, Sam hires Kathleen and Zoe to pose as his wife and daughter.  Moral conflicts arise, and Zoe is not only precocious, but is still longing for her real daddy.

I enjoy watching the situations that unfold as Del Campo's heavenly magic heals the three of them and brings them together.  It is a wonderful, magical story I never get tired of viewing around the holidays, but I only have one complaint:  They should have let Roma Downey use her Irish accent, because it's such a pleasure to listen to!",1320710400,,1629,4.74468085106383

2058986,4,B00023ELYG,"Two popular TV stars, Roma Downey (""Touched By An Angel"") and Eric McCormack (""Will And Grace, ""The New Adventures Of Old Christine""), team up for this lightweight, feel-good 1997 holiday romance. Downey is very good as Kathleen Russell, a feisty single mom who is determined to make a better life for herself and her young daughter Zoey (Sarah Rosen Fruitman). Kathleen's boss Sam (McCormack) is an ambitious, handsome, but rather cold-hearted businessman. In order to successfully complete a business merger with an enigmatic client named Del Campo (Hector Elizondo), Sam must produce an ""instant family"" over the Christmas holidays. Kathleen and Zoey fit the bill nicely. It doesn't hurt that Sam's huge mansion is an exact replica of the dollhouse Zoey has always wanted. But what Zoey really wants is for her dead-beat dad, Kathleen's ex-husband, to return. This time around, it is Elizondo, not Downey, who portrays an angel in disguise.
  The conclusion is completely  predictable from the moment the plot is set in motion. But the chemistry between Downey and McCormack makes the movie worthwhile. Their  strong lead performances carry the movie over several sentimental spots, mostly involving an increasingly annoying and weepy Fruitman.",1293321600,5,1247,5.346938775510204

2058994,4,B00023ELYG,"Sam Field, owner of Field Industry, is about to close a big business deal (a merger). Kathleen works in his factory and having been recently divorced, she is trying to earn money for a down payment on a house. She wants to move her daughter to a better neighborhood. By an odd set of circumstances, Kathleen and her daughter, Zoey, end up in Mr. Field's home just as he is looking for a woman and child to play his family. Seems his business associate has played up to the man with whom they will be signing the merger, Mr. Del Campo. He is big on family and likes to do business with family men, so his associate has told him that Sam has a family. As scenes at the beginning of the movie indicate, Sam is anything but a family man, but now he needs to acquire a family ASAP.

Of course, Kathleen and Zoey get the job as his family and proceed to turn his world upside down--all the while little Zoey is longing for her real Dad who left town six months ago without saying good-bye.

My purpose here is just to clarify what has been edited in the Feature Films for Families version and what is still in this version. I'm not passing judgment on what is appropriate for you and your family--I'm just noting the differences.
In this version, and not in the Feature Films version, in the opening scenes Sam is having a formal dinner with a girlfriend. They start out at opposite ends of the long table and end up together at one corner. Though they are ""just eating"" it is done in a very ""steamy"" manner--if you can imagine. The next thing you see is the following morning when Sam is obviously not fully dressed beneath his robe and the woman from the dinner scene is fully dressed and storming out of the house--implying that she had spent the night. In his factory that day he tells his associate about the situation and that the angry departure was because he learned she was a mother and he doesn't date women with children. His associate replies that if he didn't do the crime he doesn't do the time (implying that if he is not the father he needn't be punished by being saddled with the child) and jokes with him about how he goes through so many women. While Kathleen is working that morning she makes a comment to a coworker that includes a reference to testosterone. The first ""hired wife"" (who doesn't get the job) tells Sam that if he wants to sleep with her it will cost him an extra $100. In a conversation between Sam and Kathleen he asks if she doesn't think of him when she is in his bed (in their pseudo-marriage she sleeps in his bed and he sleeps on a cot in the dressing room/closet).  He then says, ""Tell me you're not tossing and turning and wondering."" She admits that she is. There are also a couple of incidents each of swearing and profanity. That summarizes what I could detect, having watched both versions recently. In the edited version I only noticed one time where it was obvious that something had been cut.

I like the movie. Corny?--at times, but overall an enjoyable, fluffy holiday romance that tries to squeeze in a message about the importance of family.",1290470400,33,3092,4.409807355516637
2058995,5,B00023ELYG,"After all the reviews I have read about all previous releases of this movie being an edited version, I was reluctant to order this DVD.

Do they really expect someone to pay $60 for a dvd?
So I was glad when Amazon finally released it for a normal price. It is a good ""Family"" movie, or ""Christmas"" movie, but it's also a nice romantic movie.

Well, that's only because Amazon.com doesn't allow for negative stars, so I can't actually give it a proper rating. However, I can tell you that this is a hatchet-job of editing that removed, seemingly for no reason whatsoever, key scenes in the story that left us scratching our heads in disbelief.

2059016,5,B00023ELYG,"Borrowed Hearts is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Saw it first on TV and searched for years for a DVD.  It's very different, and very entertaining.  Gives you the warm fuzzies and makes you want to see it over and over.  Great Christmas movie, which I watch during the year, not just at Christmastime.  Love the actors!",1278979200,,328,4.4
2059017,5,B00023ELYG,"If you like this film when it was on television.  I believe this is the one you have to purchase.  The Feature Film For Families video was disappointing in that it let out certain things.  Well this particular film from Echo Bridge Home Entertainment is the one you have to purchase.  I had bought this one in hopes that all the movie would be there as I remember watching from television.  Alas, it is the one from television.

If you read the other reviews about this film or even remember it.  It is enjoyable film for the Christmas holidays.  All I can say it is worth the price for being the entire movie from television.  Since I had purchased both with hopes of being the uncut version and I am glad I took the chance.

If you enjoyed this film, then buy this one.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borrowed-Hearts/dp/B003C5FMOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borrowed Hearts</a>",1278547200,5,923,5.175675675675675

The images are so dark that the movie can barely be seen.  Shame on Echo Bridge Home Entertainment for selling such a low quality DVD.

2059023,5,B00023ELYG,"Amazon has listed no details about this item so I am thinking it is a reissue of the Roma Downey movie ""Borrowed Hearts"". I researched on-line and found Echo Bridge Home Entertainment is issuing this movie on June 1, 2010. Searching the Borders and Best Buy websites I found pre-release listings for the Roma Downey movie. So I am taking a chance and ordering this movie in the belief it is ""Borrowed Hearts"" starring Roma Downey and Hector Elizondo. Pretty certain it is, but if wrong I can return it. Echo Bridge, Borders and Best Buy show a release date of June 1, 2010. Amazon shows May 25, 2010, but after I ordered the checkout form shows a date of June lst. You decide.

It wouldn't hurt to send an e-mail to Amazon asking they provide more details to their listings. I hate title only listings with no details. I have written with no results from Amazon. Maybe if enough people complain they will get on the ball.",1272585600,6,921,4.482142857142857
2059024,5,B00023ELYG,This movie is a little cheesy and has a predictable story line. And I love it! Saw several comments that scenes were cut from the TV airing. It has been so many years since I saw it on TV that I can't say I noticed. But if it comes on this next Christmas season I will be sure to find it and check that out myself (I'll be curious to see what was cut as this is very much a G rating movie). In the meantime the DVD copy will make me happy every time I watch it. :-),1270166400,,465,3.707070707070707

2059028,5,B00023ELYG,"This is without a doubt one of the best, heart warming movies that I have seen in years. Roma Downey plays a divorced single mother, (which I can really relate to). Her boss is played by Eric McCormick, a wealty man, who hires her to portray his wife for a business deal.

Being in such close proximity, he learns what it is like to live in the real world, like those of us who do live pay check to pay check.

Every Christmas I looked forward to seeing it on TV, and it wasn't on any channel this year, so I bought the DVD as my present to myself! The best gift I gave and received!",1263513600,2,583,4.017241379310345
2059029,1,B00023ELYG,"Borrowed Hearts has been shown on The Family Channel for the past 3 years and I wanted to own the movie myself, so I purchased it from Amazon.  After I watched the movie, I realised that the movie was missimg at least 5 different scenes.  This is NOT what I expected Amazon to be selling.  For the price I paid, I expected the ENTIRE movie, not part of the movie.  I am very disapointed with my purchase and with Amazon.

I have decided not to order it on DVD. I hate it when a good movie is tampered with by someone who values their on opinion on how a great movie should be.

2059039,4,B00023ELYG,"Just a cute holiday movie of which there are many to relax you during the season.  Nice to have gentle movies made with lots of love in them.  The daughter, Chloe and of course Hector were especially good in the movie.  Kind of thought Roma Downey and Eric McCormack were an odd match.  But I very much enjoyed the story.",1231200000,2,321,4.3

I ordered from one of the sellers, received it promptly, in good condition and was very pleased with my purchase until I watched it.  I just about blew a gasket.  Parts of the movie are missing and actually some of the lines that are missing are my favorite parts.  I don't know who in the world decided to make a dvd and market it as the actual item but it's missing parts and I am very disappointed.

UPDATE JAN 2011:
I just purchased the dvd where Roma Downey and Eric McCormack have their heads together on the cover and I am SO Happy that it's the movie in it's entirety. The other shouldn't be allowed to be sold without a warning of being cut. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on that one but you buy the one with the new cover you do get the whole movie. HURRAY!!!!!
Now I would rate the movie 5 STARS.",1229472000,5,909,4.055865921787709

I remember no mention of the fact that the movie content was altered.  If they had made full disclosure, I would not have purchased it as I had no complaint with the TV version.  I am an adult with no children at home and would prefer to see the movie in its entirety.  I went back to my home-taped VHS version complete with all the ads.

2059060,2,B00023ELYG,"I was disappointed in this product as it had been edited from the TV version I had originally seen.  I didn't realize the DVD was being offered by a 'family values' group.  Although the original version was barely PG, the editied version is now definitively G.  Several lines of dialogue between the 2 main adult characters were removed and an early scene which defined what kind of man the main character was has also been removed.  It's still a good movie and if you haven't seen the original, you probably won't care.  Personally, I dropped off the DVD at the Salvation Army and just kept my video-taped off the TV version - commercials and all.  For me, the interaction between the 2 main adult characters was what had made the movie worth $25 (with shipping), so losing that was a big disappointment for me.  For me, it was a waste of money.

2059062,5,B00023ELYG,"This is a great movie.  I loved it when I saw it on TV a couple of years ago.  It is set at Christmas time and it sends several great messages about people and what's in their hearts and what's really important in life.

The story line involves a local businessman who ""borrows"" a wife and child to secure a big business deal with an out-of-town businessman.  Throughout the deception, you learn the human side about the people involved.

Hector Elizondo is excellent as the out-of-town businessman.  He is so smooth and classy.  You may remember him as the hotel manager in ""Pretty Woman""--the guy who helped her ""find a dress"".  The little girl is adorable and an excellent actress.  She makes you want to grab her and hug her throughout the movie, especially in the heart-wrenching scene when her real father is about to hit the road again.  The local business man is great.  And Roma Downey, I always loved in her ""Touched By an Angel"" role.  I often find myself using the term ""a wee bit"" which I copped from her, (but it's OK because I have a little Irish in me, along with the other multi-nation parts).

This is a great family-values movie for the whole family.  It's all about love and caring for people and feeling sensitivity towards others.  Get it!  If you are a kind, sensitive, loving person, you will love the movie.",1165276800,18,1332,4.533613445378151
