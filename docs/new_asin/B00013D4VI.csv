8005957,5,B00013D4VI,"My grandson got this for Christmas, and we all watched the DVD in the afternoon.  The stop-action filming is good, and the creativity and details are fun.  The stories are simple and sweet; they're a pleasant change from most fast-moving adventures for kids of today.  My grandson thinks it's great and told me he's watched it again, during school holiday time.",1389225600,,361,4.885245901639344
8005958,5,B00013D4VI,"My 8-year-old son got this DVD for Christmas and loves it.  It makes the whole family feel good.  He just told me that Old Bear is his favorite (""He's just so kind!"") and Rabbit is his second favorite.  These are great stories for snow days, sick days, or cozy before-bed moments.  We like the stop-motion animation, which isn't as jerky as you might expect.  This show shows genuine, warm, friendly feelings you don't see on many kids' shows these days.  It's got fun and adventure galore.",1389052800,,490,4.6395348837209305

8005960,5,B00013D4VI,We love Old Bear episodes. Anton Rodgers does a wonderful job giving the characters personality through his voice. There are some parts we laugh at every time. I love how they concentrate on little details with the movement of the characters that make them really appear alive and real. Highly recommend this DVD for all.,1240531200,2,321,4.8545454545454545
8005961,5,B00013D4VI,"All 3 of my kids (ages 2, 5, and 7) LOVE this DVD.  My 7 year old has memorized several of the episodes word for word--including the British accent!  They are calming and sweet.  THumbs way up!",1213660800,4,193,4.162162162162162
