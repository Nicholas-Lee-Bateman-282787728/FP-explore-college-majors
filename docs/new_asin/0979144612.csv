7794879,5,0979144612,I think this DVD provides valuable information to those that want to train their own horse. A good foundation is needed and Smokie provides this in a format that is easy to understand. If you have the basics solid the advanced comes easier. This is also a very affordable DVD to help you get started and a good review if you are more advanced.,1329177600,,343,4.375
7794880,4,0979144612,"I was pleasantly surprised by this dvd.  Based on his description of using Andersons methods, I guess I was expecting something drastically different than what was on the dvd.  As a parelli student, I would say it is a good and interesting look at maybe a different way of getting a horse to want to be with you.  And I would have to say that upper level students or anyone who is dealing with rescues, unhandled colts or wild horses, would benefit from watching this. Why?... Because you don't need to make a huge fuss and battle of wills to be good with horses.  While it is basically similar to Parelli in principle, there are some differences in technique.  IE: missing the 'send'..and 'neutral' (more about these later)...other than that, I don't see anything that contradicts Parelli in concept or principle, nor any other sophisticated method.

Now here is a really good compliment coming.  In my new journey, for my own education, I have adapted a screening process for deciding if I like a concept, technique, method or trainer.

First.....How would I feel if I was that horse?  Would I mind being the horse of that human?  For this dvd and for Smokie, I would have to say he gets high marks in this category.  Based on the dvd, I would not have minded being his horse.

Second.....does this concept/technique make sense and is it getting the results they say it is?  Again....for Smokie...YES!

Third.....Would I send my fragile Mustang to Smokie to be started?  The list of trainers I would hand my horse over to, is a VERY short list indeed.  Seriously....less than 5 people so far have made it on that list.  I have to say......based on what I saw so far....Yes I would.

I liked his philosophies, they align well with being a Parelli student, yet there is enough ""different"" that makes it worthy of watching.  In other words, we haven't seen it a 1000 times already from Pat and Linda.

The basic purpose of his technique is to get a horse to ""hook on"".  Something like Monty Roberts 'Join Up' meets the Parelli 'Catching Game'.  No reason you could not add a 'send' into the technique he is using to make things a teeny bit clearer for both horse and human.  He does not do the stand in the middle 'neutral'.  Personally I have deleted that one from my list of 'rules' anyways, and have demoted it to a temporary tool, so two thumbs up there, as long as you find an in motion 'neutral'.  His technique I find also aligns with Carolyn Resnick's Water Hole Ritual ""leading from behind"".

I liked that he also, takes the time to just BE with the horse before he starts to make ANY requests.  Which also kinda goes along with Water Hole Ritual #1....""Sharing Territory"" and Parelli's task of `Undemanding Time"".  He gives the horse time to settle into their surroundings, and also to 'settle' with his presence.  This is something that few trainers or owners do, that I feel could very well be standing in the way of your success if it is lacking.

He also does not seem to promote drilling a horse, or running it ragged, to wear it out, and have the ""hook on"" be due to fatigue, fear, or dominance.  Which is probably why I was most surprised, as he states he kinda uses Clinton Anderson techniques and yet I find him far more benevolent than Andersons dictator fashion, and nothing he does appeared to Anderson like to me at all.  They just look nothing alike.  Which is good for Smokie in my opinion as Anderson is FAR too aggressive for my liking.  Smokie, for me, seems to encompass principles gleaned from far greater masters of the horse.

I have to say that it is evident in watching Smokie with the horses in his presence, that he truly cares about the horse.  But more than just caring, honestly he treats them like a friend.  I like that....ALOT....so for people who are not Parelli students, and thus have not seen tons of videos already....I give this 4****'s, definitely a must see, and is a good educational dvd.  I didn't fall asleep, and I was interested listening to him.  He has the Language, and the Leadership, and most importantly....the LOVE!

If you really wanted to know...given the choice....I would choose Smokie over his far more famous brother Buck....every day of the week and twice on Sunday....but that is a matter of a different`review'.

7794881,2,0979144612,"This video is of the most basic of methods for working a horse in the round pen.  If you know much about horses at all, you will not learn much.  The video shows horses that are already trained-it does not show how Smokie got to that stage with the horse or even why you would want to do this with a horse (in other words, where do you go from here).  It is a general overview of basic round pen work, but nothing here for serious trainers.",1326844800,,440,4.0344827586206895
