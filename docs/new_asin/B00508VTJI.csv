8450896,5,B00508VTJI,"I enjoy VirtualActive's DVDs with Johnny Pearman. Even though he is calm and has a low-key style, he still manages to motivate me through a solid workout on my elliptical, exercise bike, and treadmill.

My favorite part of the Northern Rockies Run was revisiting Yellowstone National Park, 'Old Faithful', etc. It was a realistic virtual run and Johnny makes occasional reminders about the intensity of the run. As usual on his runs, this ride ends with a cooldown surrounded with rushing water that made me just want to jump in!

These are great DVDs. I enjoy visiting these places or going back again, this time being able to see some sights that we never had time to see when we were there on vacation.  I'll enjoy more of these as soon as I can. There are many more places I want to run/walk with Johnny Pearman.",1385596800,,816,4.575342465753424
8450897,5,B00508VTJI,The scenery is beautiful. It brings back wonderful memories because I have hiked most of the places in the video. The guide is great. I will purchase another DVD in this series in the future.,1383782400,,191,4.485714285714286
8450898,3,B00508VTJI,"I am a big fan of the VAFitness DVDs.  They are, hands down, the best, most beautiful and most inspiring for home Spinning.
This one was clearly made before the others.  The scenery is stunning and it encourages a good hard ride.

Some negatives

1. Voice of coach is, unlike the others, not one that I could listen to again and again.  ""Awesome"" and ""Great Job"" sound like they are from my kid's computer learning games.

2. Only 40 minutes, no choice of time.

3. No cool down.  It just stops.

4.  The scenery changes too quickly.",1364169600,,533,4.402061855670103
8450899,2,B00508VTJI,"I was disappointed in this virtual cycling product.  The music was very repetitious and didn't seem to be a good match.  The cycling pace stayed constant whatever the terrain (uphill vs downhill), which didn't make it seem ""realistic"" to road cycling.  Then it switched from road cycling to mountain biking, which I don't do.  Feel as though I wasted my $$!",1363564800,,357,4.80327868852459
8450900,5,B00508VTJI,"Great instruction, keeps you motivated, not shaky, good view and pretty landscape. I use it with my indoor trainer, so I make modification as to the rpms. Bought the Wild California also",1360022400,,186,4.84375
8450901,5,B00508VTJI,"This is by far my favorite cycling DVD.  I hate cycling indoors, but some days I just can't get outside.  This is the DVD I pop in whenever I have trouble getting myself onto the indoor trainer.  Challenging, varied workout, great soundtrack and awesome scenery makes the time fly by.",1353196800,2,284,4.64
8450902,4,B00508VTJI,"I got this video to watch while running on my treadmill.  The picture quality is great and the camera is smooth.  It's definitely interesting to watch and a refreshing change from watching normal programming on the idiot box.

My only complaint is the editing.  In the video you only get about 10 seconds of footage and then there is a jump cut, usually to an entirely different location.  Why?

I'm assuming the reason for these edits is the camera man has heavy gear on and he can't run two miles straight.  Why not slow down?  He looks like he's practically sprinting thru these locations and the film is not sped up - you can see people walking in it - and people they narrowly avoid colliding with.

I can understand a log in the road so you have to stop.  Why not just continue on the other side of the log?  Why jump to four different locations within 60 seconds?

Maybe they conducted research and found people prefer these jump cuts to cut down on monotony?  I'm not sure, but I find them annoying.  Given enough time, I could probably edit the video myself and have a better product than the original (for my own personal use only).

It's too bad they couldn't film in 1080p as a digital download offering.  The digital download is  640 x 360.  If they could do that and do a better job editing, it would be five star.

EDIT:  11/4/12 - I am still watching this video every time I get on my treadmill.  I have become used to the jump cuts and they no longer bother me so I am upping the review to four stars.",1340496000,3,1518,4.293286219081272
