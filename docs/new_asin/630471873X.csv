7876704,4,630471873X,"Excellent video. The soundtrack, while good, does not always seem to fit well with the mood of the images. Would suggest muting the sound and playing a more pastoral music mix on a cd or mp3 as a background.",1492819200,,207,4.333333333333333
7876705,3,630471873X,I really enjoyed the VHS version of this film. The audio of the DVD is a little harsh.,1419897600,,86,3.8333333333333335
7876706,5,630471873X,This was a gift for friends who were going on an Alaskan cruise.  They watched it the day before leaving.  They loved it; said it was just beautiful.  It was a recommendation from a friend who lives in Alaska and loves the beauty of that land and sky.,1378771200,,251,4.1875
7876707,5,630471873X,"Every time I loan this out , I never get it back. One copy of this bought me FIVE steak dinners!  You must have a copy of this to add to any collection!  Don't buy this if you can't stand the most beautiful scenery magically combined with the most awesome music...PURE DREAMLIKE ARTIST MAGIC and I'm not lying.  There are others...but this one is THE BEST!!!!!",1369008000,,360,4.424242424242424
7876708,5,630471873X,"Nice work in the Pre-HighDeff days of filming the various inspirational shots one would expect from Alaska.
Instrumental soundtrack from some of the Staple Performers in New-Age music.",1293667200,,184,5.607142857142857
7876709,5,630471873X,"Contrary to what two earlier reviewers suggested, this DVD is NOT a nature program.

1) It's an artistic endeavour in which the editor(s) have attempted to combine quality contemporary instrumental music with beautiful (video) photography.

2) There is no (semi-)famous personage reading from a script concerning what we are seeing and a subject about which he probably knows less than you the viewer.  If anything, the music should be regarded as the narrator.  This is ART.

3) For someone to offer this to fans of PBS (""Pretty Blatant Socialists"") as a production that would be of interest to them is misleading.  PBS-lovers probably will not enjoy this DVD; it doesn't encourage a materialistic (i.e. quasi-Marxist) world-view.

On a ""positive"" note, if this DVD has the same visual material as the original VHS, then by all means get it!  If you have even a passing interest in photography, I suspect you'll be deeply impacted when you watch this.  In fact, once you view this production you may never again be able to look through your camera's lens without hearing music in your head.  (Okay, maybe that's an overstatement; but I think you get my point.)",1210377600,2,1161,4.938144329896907
7876710,5,630471873X,"Bookstore often have a selection of oversize books featuring gorgeous nature photographs. True North expands on this idea by going from still photos to moving video and adding music. The shots were taken in Alaska and Canada and each track focuses on a theme including rugged solitude of mountain peaks, the impossibly deep green of the temerate rainforests, orcas and humpback whales, glacial ice melted into abstract sculptures, and the wonders of the Aurora Borealis. The music of John Serrie, Paul Speer, James Reynolds and Tangerine Dream (who only provide a single track - sorry fans!) fits very well with the scenes.
Given the technical expertise in obtaining the photos, creating the music (which is pretty much all synthesizers), and editing them together, it is somewhat surprising that the DVD doesn't seem to be put together as well. The main menu consists of eight boxes, each with a number. No thumbnail video, not even the name of the track. And for you ""special feature"" junkies, there's really nothing available. You are given the option of having the tracks repeat or run in random order, like you might do on a CD player, but that's it. (And while I'm venting, the disc itself is hard to get out of the case.)
So while the disc itself has some annoying quirks, the content itself is spectacular and you'd be hard pressed to find much at the same price.",1038873600,6,1371,4.813559322033898
