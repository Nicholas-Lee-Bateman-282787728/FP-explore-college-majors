5390759,3,B00A6Y9EZW,"I like documentaries like this...""vigilante"" type deals where the 99% stand up to the 1%.  That said, this film also left me hanging quite a bit.  We never got to see the finished course or what ultimately happened to the various residents, for that matter.  Did they get their water turned back on?  Did Trump plow down half that man's house because it supposedly was on his property?  Did the wind farm end up happening?  I guess I expected more answers!  It feels weird to have to turn to Google in order to get them.  Perhaps they could have kept filming for another few more months (or longer) in order to give the viewer a more complete picture of the final outcome rather than leaving us hanging.  (BTW I streamed this movie, so I'm not sure whether or not there are any updates contained in the bonus features of the physical DVD).  Regardless, the documentary is worth watching.",1365552000,10,887,4.556962025316456
5390760,5,B00A6Y9EZW,I highly recommend this documentary.  It is well made and gives an unbiased view of the situation regarding Donald Trump's purchase of land on which to build a golf course.,1365552000,3,172,4.733333333333333
5390761,4,B00A6Y9EZW,"The 2011 documentary YOU'VE BEEN TRUMPED echoes a 1983 fictional film from which it borrows clips, LOCAL HERO.  Both features depict foreign business interests stealing a community in Scotland, similar to what the European nations of the Berlin Conference did to Africa in the nineteenth century.  The difference between YOU'VE BEEN TRUMPED and LOCAL HERO is as stark as that of a happy ending and an unhappy one.

YOU'VE BEEN TRUMPED proves an apex of the one percent's assault on the world.  No longer content to pilfer from fellow citizens, now the moneyed interests go international in pursuit of what belongs to others, full circle from that Berlin Conference.  In YOU'VE BEEN TRUMPED, Donald Trump wines and dines Scottish authorities into forcing locals to sell their property so he can build a golf course.  Perhaps because Trump comes off so egregiously in this documentary as he bad-mouths the lifestyle of a Scot landowner who won't sell, the filmmakers soft-pedal the fact that Trump's fortune started with an inheritance of $250 million Trump's father made building government-subsidized housing.  Not that Donald Trump couldn't soak taxpayers on his own; he got a $60 million tax break to refurbish a hotel in New York City in one of his first real estate ventures. Like father, like son.

One more fictional movie comes to mind when I think of YOU'VE BEEN TRUMPED, the 1987 classic WALL STREET.  While Gordon Gekko's words, ""Greed is good"" is the line most quoted from WALL STREET, another of his remarks rings a louder truth: ""If you're not inside, you're outside.""  A foreigner he may be, but YOU'VE BEEN TRUMPED shows us billionaire foreigner Donald Trump is on the inside and regular people whose property he covets from more than 3,000 miles away are on the outside.",1365292800,17,1786,4.9630872483221475
5390762,5,B00A6Y9EZW,"This film has been made in real time by a producer who felt empathy for the people at Trumps mercy, the actions of the vindictive, cold hearted Trump is basically criminal and he is shown to have complete contempt for the people who live in the area he has chosen for his golf course, all they have done is want to preserve the area they live in and keep their homes, but trump has given them 2yrs of misery and destruction.
The part where the filmaker is arrested will leave your mouth wide open, grampian police are way out of line and its all fimed with complete dignity, if all these things were happening to most of us we wouldnt be so calm and dignified as these good people are.
A great film with humor and intrigue into the crazy world of Trump! A must watch for our American cousins, see how Trump conducts himself abroad.",1362873600,11,831,4.333333333333333
5390763,5,B00A6Y9EZW,"If you are a fan of reality television (I'm not), you have obviously seen a lot of Billionaire real estate developer Donald Trump and know that he loves to hold whatever control and power he can get over individuals. While not a reality series with a planned plot, this recent wonderful documentary by British documentarian Anthony Baxter is REAL; captured in real time by Baxter (and even some of the local residents in a small community in Scotland - where Trump planned to build the world's largest golf course - when given hand help camcorders by Baxter).
One of my favorite ""small films"" is ""Local Hero"", a fictional feature film made in 1983 by Bill Forsythe which revolves around an American oil tycoon (played by Burt Lancaster) who sends his representative (Peter Riegert) to a similar Scottish community to buy up farm land and drill for oil. Baxter draws the parallel but incorporating scenes from ""Local Hero"" into his 100-minute film. What makes the store in ""You've Been Trumped"" so disheartening is that here there are real people who have lived on a beautiful coast with gorgeous sand dunes and lots of natural wildlife. And, as Baxter captures on his camera, the local police are - not surprisingly - on Trump's side because the politicians want the notoriety of the big project, damn the longtime residents.
Environmentalists will shed a tear as they watch the land being destroyed to make way for tee-off spots and a big hotel.  The film is self-narrated by Baxter (who is an engaging speaker) and the residents. You are really drawn in to the story.
The DVD has a few two-minute clipsz of ""unused footage"" but the really special bonus is the 25-minute episode of Bill Moyers' show ""Moyers& Company"" where he interviews Baxter and urges ALL his viewers to see this important film. I, too, urge you to see it. And highly recommend watching the Moyers interview. It will give you even more to think about and adds to the material in the film.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

This film is directed by Anthony Baxter, who lived not far fromwhere the actions took place, in Aberdeenshire. It is about the futile efforts of long-time residents to stop the Trump organization from building an enormous golf course on the Aberdeen coast of Scotland in an environmentally sensitive area which was an estuary and natural preserve. At first the Scottish government said no, but Trump promised that it would boost the economy and there would be 1,000 jobs and it would be the largest luxury golf links in the world.
. (Actuall y there were less than 100 jobs.) Michael Forbes, Susan Munro and other residents refused to sell their land to Trump and he proceeded anyway, and in doing so shoveled with giant machinery cometely obliterating . and flattening out the dunes and filling the residents' wells with dirt, cutting off their electricity and barring Mike Forbes' access to his work. Mr. Baxter was arrested by the Trump-paid Scottish police and jailed for a day. He and the residents were tbreatened by Trump's goons. Excellent job by Baxter and the brave families who told their story. This, however, is one of dozens of examples of how Trump operates.

Seeing the way that ""The Donald"" chooses to treat these Scottish citizens is very telling and speaks volumes of a man with no real character or moral compass to speak of. On the occasions that you do see The Donald interacting in this film he makes no attempts at mutual cooperation of any kind and even appears to take pleasure in knowing the suffering and hardship he is causing in this small community of people fighting to save their homes and their way of life. Most of the time what you are looking at is the wake of the destruction left behind by those who doing Trump's dirty work for him, those in his back pocket, including local politicians, local university and even the police.

It is sad. Sad for not only these hard working decent people, but sad for the The Great Dunes of Scottland and The North Sea, that he has single handedly forever changed and destroyed.

5391071,5,B00A6Y9EZW,"I won't go into detail the way so many have. Trump went to Scotland, and wanted to build the best Golf Course in the world. Unfortunately He does it at the expense of the last Natural Dunes Scotland had, and ruined them. Trump also used his money to play local officials, of every kind, and tried to push people off their land. When it became a dog fight for the last few houses, Trump degrades them by calling their homes slums and he would have to spend money to hide their houses so the world class golfers and anyone on the course would not see them. Basically David vs Goliath story. I am sure there must have been somewhere on the water near the beach, where Trump could have built the course without putting pressure on people to sell their homes, insulting them to the point of embarrassment of his behavior. Trump once through a contestant out of the boardroom and fired him for using the word ""white trash"". It is a common used term. I am white and I don't take offense. But what he called and described these people to be just because their homes were in their family for over a 100 years and so many generations? It made me think some of what he says on his show maybe just for the camera's, and he is not quite as honest as he would portray himself as.

Why not just look for another spot on the beach and leave the homes, and the natural Dunes alone. And so you see the battle and the interactions between the many people involved. The film crew, they get thrown off, I think arrested? And there was no charge. It is truly about Trump's influence on a small part of Scotland where small town people don't want high level billionaire types pushing them around.
