8692326,3,B00QQRBKEQ,"I hate step. I should start by saying that because it really guides my review of this disc. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the other reviews that said a ""traditional step warm-up"" etc. I was thinking we were using the step to change elevation levels and make the leg workout harder. But we are usually using the step as a, well, step aerobics kind of step. I despise that. I hate the leg up leg over bounce back do a repeater type stuff. And that's what we do. So I find myself doing what I like to do on the step, which is lunges, box jumps, Mary Katherines, etc. And if I'm not following the DVD, I don't find it to be that great. Also, the entire warm-up is choreographed step aerobics and I don't like it. I also tried a couple premixes and found them to be super jumpy - meaning the transitions aren't smooth from one to the next. It's probably the nature of the premixes that I choose, but other times I've picked premixes and I'm generally really impressed with how they transition the chapters.

What I do really like is the mixing of cardio and weight intervals. I don't use the weights Cathe et al use and I don't keep changing between barbell and dumbbell. I typically pick 8 or 10 pound dumbbells and just use them for the whole workout.

I've only recently discovered Cathe Friedrich (past year or so) and although I really love some of the DVDs I've used, I'm not a total convert. Seems like most folks love every DVD that she puts out, but I definitely like some more than others. This is not a favorite because of my aversion to step, but I do think it delivers a good workout. Not sure how that will pan out for me as far as how often I reach for it. 3.5 stars",1496361600,4,1687,4.219814241486068
8692327,4,B00QQRBKEQ,"I love this workout, and would have given 5 stars except for the warm up which is too fast paced for a warm up IMO. I do a regular warm up, and then use Cathe's warm up as part of the cardio section. Apart from this, it's a great lower body and/or step workout. Fun and I like the music.",1489622400,,287,3.8
8692328,5,B00QQRBKEQ,"Fantastic workout!!  Challenging and never boring.  It's nonstop and definitely not for beginners.  All of Cathe's dvds are great, but this one takes it up a notch from her previous series.  I highly recommend for individuals looking to get their heart rate up and keep it there.  You do weights and cardio intervals throughout.  Definitely a new favorite!!",1453507200,,357,5.068965517241379
8692329,5,B00QQRBKEQ,Thanks!  Awesome lower body workout.,1444089600,,36,6.2
8692330,5,B00QQRBKEQ,I'm always excited about buying cathe's dvd's. She challenges me beyond my limits and I'm left feeling great about what I've accomplished. She never disappoints.,1434585600,,161,5.48
8692331,5,B00QQRBKEQ,"I was completely humbled by this workout.  I was thinking that this wouldn't be that hard since my legs are the strongest part of my body. Well, I was mistaken.  But it was all in a good way, of course.

This wonderful workout combines cardio blasts with leg strength training moves.  It is one very tough workout.  I think it's the hardest of the Ripped with Hiit Series.  I couldn't use the same weights as Cathe by a long shot.  My heart was pounding and my legs were fried even when I was using significantly less weight!  I also wasn't doing the high impact jumping off of and onto the step that Cathe was doing.  Yet, my heart rate was up there.
