VALDEZ IS COMING

Released in 1971, ""Valdez is Coming"" is a significant Western that champions human dignity. It's a tale of the meek (not the weak) versus the arrogant.

PLOT: Bob Valdez (Burt Lancaster) is an aging Mexican-American constable who runs into a ruthless rich cattleman, Frank Tanner (Jon Cypher), who senselessly causes the death of a black man for sport more than anything else. When Valdez humbly insists that Tanner provide a little money ($100) for the black man's pregnant Indian widow he is ridiculed, scorned and ultimately tortured. Valdez pulls out his old Indian-fighting uniform, his antique buffalo rifle and goes forth in the name of justice -- attaining the hundred bucks at all costs and wiping out anyone who opposes him.

Burt Lancaster was 57 years old at the time and is almost unrecognizable as Valdez. Some have complained about a blue-eyed man of Mexican descent, but it's not terribly uncommon for Mexican-Americans to have blue eyes, as well as Puerto Ricans (in fact, Hector Elizondo has a minor role in the film and he's a light-eyed Latino). Some complain about Lancaster's accent but I think he comes off authentic; besides, are there any recordings of Mexican-American accents from 130 years ago? Lancaster does a fine guesstimate.

""Valdez is Coming"" is essentially a one-man army tale. It's not so much about revenge, as some claim, but rather justice and simple human dignity. Although I'm sure Valdez was infused with a spirit of vengeance to some degree when he first sets out against Tanner and his henchmen -- especially seeing he was just horribly disrespected and tortured -- any need for revenge is clearly expunged after the mounting blood spilling; by the end of the film it's obvious that all he wants is the $100 and the case would be closed.

A hundred dollars is an arbitrary number; what Valdez really wants is Tanner to pay for the senseless death of the black man and acknowledge the existence of his Native widow. Tanner is corrupted by power, pride, greed and racism and looks down on everyone else, especially non-whites like Valdez, the black man and the pregnant Indian. But he makes the mistake of underestimating Valdez because of his meekness, ancestry and disheveled appearance.

Speaking of disheveled, one interesting contrast in the film is the difference of Valdez before and after he goes after Tanner. Before his quest for justice he appears spent, unkempt and slightly portly; but when he dons his old uniform and sets forth to attain justice he appears focused, orderly and trim.

Throughout it all he's the embodiment of nobility and humility. The more one ages in enlightenment and spirituality the more one acquires humility. We see this wonderful quality overflowing in Valdez from the start (kudos to Lancaster), but it's woefully absent in Tanner.

Susan Clark has a significant role as Tanner's woman, whom Valdez kidnaps. Susan is notable for her stunning appearance and non-verbal acting skills.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Spain.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Valdez is Coming"" is essentially a one-man army Western. Although it's far less compelling than, say, ""First Blood,"" in its favor are a sense of grim realism and a potent message about human dignity, justice and the superiority of humility over arrogance. It's also a smart film that refuses to spell everything out in a spoon-fed fashion, but it leaves little doubt for those who take into account all the blatant cues.

GRADE: B+ or A-

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END? ***SPOILER*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film). The further Tanner's lead henchman gets into the conflict, the more he sees the truth about both Tanner and Valdez. He consequently calls off his men, saying in effect, ""This isn't our fight; you're on your own Tanner.""

At this point Tanner is stripped of his protective covering and stands alone against Valdez, and he painfully knows he can't beat Valdez in a draw. He's lost and so takes the only reasonable option, paying the $100.

This works better than merely killing Tanner as he would never be able to live down such a masterful humiliation. With numerous witnesses to spread the word, Tanner would die a thousand deaths.

Rejoice the victory of the righteous, humble man.

THE RIDE BACK

""The Ride Back"" is a B&W Western from 1957 starring William Conrad (aka ""Cannon"") as a hard-luck Texas lawman sent to Mexico to bring back a charismatic man wanted for murder, played by Anthony Quinn.

Plot-wise, the film is reminiscent of another B&W 1957 Western, ""3:10 to Yuma,"" but ""The Ride Back"" was released about 4 months prior to ""3:10"" and was adapted from a ""Gunsmoke"" radio program episode. Conrad played Matt Dillon on the radio show in the 50s and early 60s but was too short and portly for the TV version that premiered in 1955 with James Arness starring as Marshal Dillon. Conrad produced ""The Ride Back"" in response.

Viewing ""The Ride Back"" for the first time, it is interesting to see William Conrad some 15 years before starring in ""Cannon"" and Anthony Quinn is as larger-than-life as ever, not to mention the stunningly beautiful Lita Milan as Quinn's Mexican girlfriend. Yet I discovered that the true appeal of ""The Ride Back"" transcends these surface attractions.

The first thing that happily struck me about the movie is that the filmmakers strove for realism in the manner of notable 50s Westerns by Stewart/Mann and Scott/Boetticher. Such realism is observed in the heavy use of Spanish in the early Mexican segments and the film's depiction of Indians. The Native Americans here are elusive wraiths more than anything else, but that's the best route to go at a time when more close-up portrayals of Indians typically came off artificial and even laughable, especially as seen through modern eyes.

After the first half-hour the film morphs into a moving character study. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Hamish (Conrad) slowly realizes that Kallen (Quinn) is everything he's not: Hamish is brooding and self-loathing while Kallen exudes life and confidence; Hamish's wife hates him while Kallen's girlfriend is so devoted she chases him across the desert; Hamish is a loner while Kallen inspires love and loyalty, so much so that the Mexican villagers are willing to kill Hamish at Kallen's word; an orphaned girl withdraws from Hamish while naturally bonding with Kallen, etc. We also learn the reason for Hamish's obsessive hunt is that he wanted to finally do something right and prove himself to his wife and the people of his Texas community. As the story progresses Hamish is increasingly enlightened to the greatness of Kallen. It's a testimony to his character that this enlightenment doesn't result in hateful envy bur rather admiration and respect. ***END SPOILER***

The title song was sung by Eddie Albert of ""Green Acres"" fame; a lot of people hate it but I thought it was pretty decent. Hey, it's better than similar Western theme songs from the era, like the horrible ""North to Alaska"" (wonderful film but lousy theme song).

The film runs 79 minutes and was shot in California and Mexico.

FINAL WORD: I was braced for an artificial 50's Western but got a potent character study instead. Who would have thought? The only negatives I can cite are that it's in black & white and has some slow, less-than-compelling parts. Regardless, I prefer it to the original ""3:10 to Yuma.""

GRADE: B+ or A-

=========================

BUFFALO BILL AND THE INDIANS

Released in 1976 and directed by Robert Altman, ""Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson"" stars Paul Newman as Buffalo Bill Cody, the star of his famous ""Wild West Show"" in the shadow of the Rockies in 1885. After Chief Sitting Bull of Little Big Horn fame (Frank Kaquitts) arrives with his Number One (Will Sampson), Cody is irked that the chief isn't a slaughtering savage, but is silently heroic and honorable. Cody fires him, but relents when star attraction Annie Oakley (Geraldine Chaplin) sympathizes with Sitting Bull. Then President Grover Cleveland (Pat McCormick ) visits with his entourage.

This is revisionist Western, a ""message movie"" that Altman uses to criticize popular ideas or myths about the Old West. The titular hero is merely a showbiz creation who can no longer differentiate the truth from his made-up image. He's a blustering fool who asserts to be one with the Wild West, but lives in extravagance, play-acting in his Western circus. His hair is fake, he can no longer shoot straight or track a Native; and all his theatrical duels with owlhoots and Indians are fixed in his favor.

The theme is interesting and the ensemble cast is great (which also includes Burt Lancaster, Kevin McCarthy, Harvey Keitel, John Considine, Noelle Rogers, Shelley Duvall and Denver Pyle, amongst other notables). It shouldve worked, but it didnt. Its somewhat akin to Little Big Man (1970) but less of a comedy and nowhere near as entertaining (not that I'm a big fan of that movie or anything, but at least it has its entertaining moments). While the Wild West circus elicits some entertaining moments (e.g. rodeo stunts) they cant save the flick from being an arty, pretentious, tiresome bomb. Moreover, the principle Native Americans are ironically so one-dimensional and wooden I thought maybe Altman was making a snide aside about ""wooden Indians.""

Lastly, the ideology is blatantly one-sided against the New Americans, depicting Not-as-New Americans as super-noble while conveniently ignoring their documented dark side, e.g. the heinous torture tactics most tribes inflicted on their captive enemies, including other tribes-people, so as to hinder their condition in the afterlife (the ""happy hunting grounds"" or whatever). For instance, they'd gouge out enemies' eyes or mutilate their genitals so they (supposedly) wouldn't be able to see or copulate in the after-world. Yup, that's just so virtuous (sarcasm). Actually, I could handle this lopsided perspective if the movie itself were entertaining, but that's hardly the case.

The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, mostly at Stoney Indian Reserve.
