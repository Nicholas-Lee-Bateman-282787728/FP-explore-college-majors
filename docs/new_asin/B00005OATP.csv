7948510,3,B00005OATP,"The opera's from Wagner got me into opera in general but it are his opera's I return to at the end of the day and can't get away from. And it is from these opera's that I want to hear as many different versions (and interpretations) from as possible.

The big plusses from this production are the beautifull -19th century with classic elements- stage scenes and clever - around the action- stage directions from Patrice Chereau and the orchestral work under the baton of Pierre Boulez. Boulez is one of my favorite Wagner-conductors (along with Karl Bohm and Clemens Krauss). Boulez let the music ""breath"" and do its work. With him there's always a lot of movement and fluidity. No artificial exaggerations in volume or pauses in tempi to ""enhance"" the effect of drama (merely an effect it stays then).

The big con of this production is the voices (yes really). Expecially Gwyneth Jones looks much better then she sounds as Brunnhilde. Every time she reaches her ""Schlussgesang"" I reach for the volumebutton on my stereo to give it turn to the left. Manfred Jungs' Siegfried has a voice that scares the cat and Fritz Hubners' Hagen sounds much to thin. Watching these production reminds me of what really makes the story and the drama in an opera: the voices, backupped by the music, the acting and (eventually) the scenery on stage. With this one it is the other way around. Does that prevent the drama from taking off? No, this is a case of bad singers transformed into good actors (because that they are) set in a wonderfull stage environnement that makes a very accessible compelling story. But is only with Gwendolyn Killebrews Waltraute singing that you experience what this production might have been if the rest of the cast was likewise up to their role. Almost all the ingredients for superb drama are here, only the main ingredient falls short, and that prevents me of giving it 5 stars (3.5 out of 5 would be my rating).",1117670400,5,1932,4.696165191740413
7948511,3,B00005OATP,"At the heart of this production - and probably the single biggest reason to either like or dislike it - is the somewhat avante-garde staging, replacing the classic furs, leather, and armor with business suits and workmen's clothing.  Instead of water nymphs at the bottom of the Rhine, you get prostitutes at a hydroelectric plant.  For me, it just doesn't work.  It's no secret that the Ring was symbolically linked to the class struggles and rebellions of mid 19th century Germany, nor is it a secret that Wagner, himself, was a political activist.  But even he, by the time he got around to writing the music for Gotterdammerung had completely changed personal philosophies (he had embraced Schopenhaur).  My feeling is that the Ring is best portrayed in it's organic mythological trappings, and left for individual audience members to apply the symbology as they see fit.  That is if they even WANT to take it for more than a huge musical tapestry.  'Nuff said about that.  I very clearly remember when the centenial production was staged, and how poorly the performances - especially those of Ms. Jones (who I personally saw sing an electrifying Isolde at the Met two years prior)- were recieved.  Interestingly, when the LP version of that Ring was released, Gotterdammerung was released as an analog recording (the other 3 were digital).  The word at the time was that the producers were so dissapointed with the performances that they didn't want to invest the additional money to make a digital recording of the final opera.  Apocryphal?  Maybe.  Rgardless, the singing by the Met company, headed by an amazing Hildegard Behrens and James Morris SO outshines this production that there is barely competition.  As a historical document the Boulez ""Centennial"" Ring is interesting, but if you are going to invest in only one ""Ring"", this is NOT the one to buy - stick with Levine and the Met!",1115251200,9,1899,4.912225705329154
7948512,5,B00005OATP,"This is one of the best DVD recording of an opera that I've watched. Brian Large's videography is simply great! The sets are good, and the acting and direction are of superior quality. The singing is, by and large, forceful and true to the spirit of the music. I admire Gwyneth Jones in the role of Brunnhilde - a great actress and a powerful singer, even though there're a few (very few, actually) squalls. Manfred Jung is not the traditionally heroic Siegfried, but his portrayal works well in this specific production. The other characters all look their parts as well. The chorus sings lustily and Boulez and the excellent Bayreuth orchestra do a fine job. I would recommend this recording to all.",1087344000,2,701,4.754098360655738
7948513,5,B00005OATP,I won't be able to write a lot. Suffice to say that I found the production to be brilliant and the singing and acting to be of superlative quality. This is the kind of modern operatic performances that can prove to most people that the genre is as exciting as any other kind of theatrical performances and is worthy of doing.,1078272000,8,325,4.344262295081967
7948514,4,B00005OATP,"When I watched for the first time this DVD (well, it was a Laserdisc, for that happened prior to the release on DVD) I knew the music of the Ring for 6 years (more or less) and I hadn't yet seen any other production. I have to confess that it was watching it that I had for the first time a feeling of understanding not only the music but the drama. Since then my relation with Wagner's music and drama changed completely and he became one of my great musical loves along with Puccini. As time has passed I have also my regrets to this production (the dullness of the image) but I still love it. That cannot say in the same degree about the other operas of the cycle, specially about boring, with nothing to say 'Siegfried'.
I'm not a fan of Boulez conducting Wagner operas. I also think that his axionatic 'return to the truth' when conducting this Ring in Bayreuth in the 70s and his negative to accept tempi acquired by tradition was an out-of-place extrapolation of the phenomenological principles that guided him in composition (that's to say, to do music as if one had been born out of the world, had no bias derived from tradition and had to invent the laws of music from zero).
Nevertheless, although I'm opposed to almost all of Boulez's ideas about music, I feel confortable with much of his music and sometimes also with his conducting. This is the place with this Gtterdmmerung, the highest peak of an irregular and overall not very satisfactory Ring cycle. With a disciplined, a little constrained and in some sense modern orchestral sound, with the help of excellent actor-singers achieves some moments of such profound tragicness that I cannot forget while hearing any other recording.
These are my irrepetible moments:
- Act I: Scene between Brnnhilde and Gutrune. I will never forget the tragic accents, the description of the end of an old world, by Gwendoline Killebrew and the sober response by Brnnhilde 'Welch banger Trume Mren meldest du mir"". Also excellent her downfall minutes later when Siegfried comes in disguise and submits her.
- Act II almost in its entirety. Haunting first scene between Hagen and Alberich, frightening, almost nazi scene of the vassals, heartbreaking realization of the downfall of the Gods through Hagen's manipulations when Brnnhilde holds her violent agonistic scene with Siegfried, scandal of the people, and final bloody vendetta trio.
- Acto III. Full expresionistic final scene from the moment in which Gutrune (Jeannine Altmeyer) cannot sleep due to nightmares, the murder of king Gunther (great actor Franz Mazura, also excellent Schn/Jack the Ripper in Boulez's Lulu and Moses in Solti's 'Moses und Aron') by his brother for the possesion of the ring and appearance of apocalyptic Brnnhilde in a final monologue for which I haven't words enough.
Ok, this Gtterdmmerung has not a brilliant funeral march or a Siegfried singer to compete with many others (althogh here he is much more inspired that in his boring rendition of the role in 'Siegfried'), but it has the Brnnhilde that made me understand the deepest feeling of this work (Gwyneth Jones, and I mean the Ring complete cycle) and I still have to listen to it when want to remember the true sense of this metaphore of the world's destruction by the greedness of the powerful.
Sorry for my English.

7948515,5,B00005OATP,"This is a splendid summation of a memorable Ring Cyle. The drama and stage direction are compelling, and the standard of acting is superb across the board. Although Wagner probably doesn't forsee that such dramatic and scenic up-dates would occur to his mighty dramas, to a modern audience like myself who is familiar with such a kind of approaches in straight theater, I found the production immensely enjoyable.
As I've suggested above, the standard of acting is wonderful. Much of the singing is also very fine, with the entire cast led by Gwyneth Jones in one of her best recorded performances ever. I do like Manfred Jung's Siegfried that much, but I believe such an approach is part of the production's dramaturgy. The others, including the chorus, immersed themselves totally into the production and drama, and Boulez's kept a tight rein on his fine orchestra and, thanks to Bayreuth's unique acoustics, never overwhelmed the singers.
It's all very memorable indeed. I suppose that I'll be watching it over and over again in the days and years to come.",1056931200,6,1059,4.955056179775281
7948516,5,B00005OATP,"This is in many ways a splendid production of a mightly opera. The staging is pleasing to the eye and the direction is imaginative. The acting of the singers has reached a level rarely attained on the operatic stage. The singing here is also fine, although perhaps a notch below the level of acting. Fortunately, we have the magnificent Brunnhilde of Gwyneth Jones to anchor the entire enterprise. Handsome in stage presence, Jones sings with great power and abandon from start of finish. This is really an exhilarating portryal of a hugely demanding role. Manfred Jung's voice is not of a high quality, but he definitely looks the part. Anyway, it's a very memorable stage performance that is now well-captured on DVD.",1031529600,2,719,4.901639344262295
7948517,4,B00005OATP,"This is a strange production of the Gotterdammerung, which first appeared in the 70?s and was apparently met by booing. Since then it has achieved some measure of acceptance.
The general response to the release of this production that apparently was filmed in the 80?s has generally been positive as far as the music is concerned although it is thought that Jung who sings the role of Siegfried is not up to it.
Prior to this I have heard recordings of the work by Karajan, Solti and Janowski. Although I preferred the Solti the sound quality of this DVD is excellent and generally the singing appears flawless.
It is hard however to watch the production totally dispassionately. Part of the problem with Opera on DVD is that one is a lot closer to the action than one is in the theatre. The appearance of the characters can jar one from the suspension of disbelief which is critical to any film or entertainment experience. In this case Gwyneth Jones is simply to old for the part of Brunnhilde. The looks a fare way the wrong side of 50 and she wears a rather shapeless smock. When she appears one is continually jolted back from being part of the action to realising that this is a performance in which she has been chosen for her voice.
The production sets the actions around the late 19th early 20th century so that the aristocratic characters wear eveningwear and suits and the tribesmen dress as French factory workers. Obviously trying to suggest that the opera had something to say about the break down of a society based on privilege and aristocratic values under the pressure of revolutionary ideas. From memory Wagner himself might have muttered something along these lines before he became conservative and in love with notions of race.
However again it is difficult to suspend one?s disbelief. Hagen wanders around looking like a dishevelled bank clerk holding a rather large spear. Siegfried seems to ponce around with a breast plate and a small dagger which is meant to be his sword. Gunther?s retainers, the French factory workers grab spears in the action scenes.
Still as you see it more, it seems to make sense. When I first saw it I would have joined those who wanted to burn the producer at the stake, but you sort of get used to it.",1030147200,4,2255,4.668341708542713
7948518,5,B00005OATP,"Due to the high cost of this collection, I decided to purchase my favorite opera from the Ring, which is Gtterdmerung. If the rest of the Chreau Ring Cycle is as incredible as this production of Wagner's Gtterdmmergung, then my only regret will be that I didn't save money and buy the entire Ring, which as a set is sold at a special price.  This glorious production is on 2 discs (over 4 hours) with rich, full stero and surround sound of the highest quality that DVD has to offer. The sound quality is superior to a lot of opera productions on DVD that were made much later than this one. Unfortunately, the picture quality is not always at the same high level of the sound quality, especially in the darker scenes, of which there are many in this opera. Even so, the picture quality is no worse than slightly below average, and often it is quite good. The singing is first rate--Gwyneth Jones' Brnnhilde especially captivated me. For me the entire cast was outstanding in bringing this amazing work to life. Of course with Wagner the orchestra as is vital as the singing, and the Bayreuther Festspeile Orchestra under Pierre Boulez is radiant throughout. This is a modern production, and while controversial some 20 years ago, it seems just right for today. I prefer it to the more traditional Ring productions, but that is a question of personal taste. I look forward to viewing the rest of the highly acclaimed Chreau Ring cycle, for if the standards are a high as they are for Gtterdmmerung, it will rank for me as one of the greatest accomplishments for opera on DVD.",1006041600,25,1574,4.601423487544484
