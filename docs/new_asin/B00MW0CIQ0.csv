8674939,5,B00MW0CIQ0,"I purchased this set of movies a few months ago, and am glad I did. At the time, I believe it was priced at $7.99. I am a avid Prime shopper and rarely purchase anything other than Prime items, but when I saw this was not Prime, I still decided to buy because my daughter and I enjoy lounging around in out pajamas, watching movies that make us laugh and cry (why? I have no clue). However, even with this item not being prime, I am happy to say that it was delivered within the next week.",1480636800,,489,4.051546391752577
