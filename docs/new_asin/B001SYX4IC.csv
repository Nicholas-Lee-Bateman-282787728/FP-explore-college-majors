8340233,3,B001SYX4IC,"For a low budget Sci-Fi movie, it is okay. The actors, while relatively unknown, do an adequate job, there is the usual cliche casting, the hard bitten sergeant with a heart of gold, and the hot blonde ace pilot who flies the drop ship like it is a fighter. The special effects are what one expect of a movie of this genre. The plot is solid, pan-dimensional aliens are attacking human space and turning everyone, even children, into zombie slave warriors. There is lots of overblown action segments. Mostly to offset the low budget-ness, I guess. If Sci-Fi ""B"" movies are your thing, then this should be in your library.",1429833600,,621,4.654545454545454
