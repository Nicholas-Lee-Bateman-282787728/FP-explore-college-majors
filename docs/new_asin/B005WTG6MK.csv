4899934,5,B005WTG6MK,"This was truly a riveting character driven drama with some quirky comedic moments.  It was excellent but I can understand why it may not be some folks cup of tea.  It is meant to hit you in the face with some disturbing emotional situations.  This IS real life for some people.  The acting by Ellen Barkin was outstanding and it is a shame she was overlooked for an Oscar nom.  Ellen Burnstyn also did fantastic and surprisingly so did Demi Moore.  My wife and I would highly recommend this film, but beware, it is not a warm and fuzzy drama or comedy, which may have left a bad taste with some people who were expecting something different.  Sundance thought it was excellent, and it is.  Get it and be the judge for yourself.",1330214400,2,727,4.413533834586466
4899935,2,B005WTG6MK,"Even with the likes of the actors working here, this script CANNOT BE SAVED!  Many lines and character interactions are forced and overly dramatic.  The dysfunctions in this family are not unheard of and certainly have been dramatized in the past to much greater effect:  poor Lynn cannot seem to find her core nor her power and is left whimpering to her children or barely relating to her clueless husband.  Paul, the ex-, is never really fleshed out and is alternately sympathetic and pathetic.  His wife, played by a strident Demi Moore, is the stereotypical other woman.  Ellen Burnstyn's character as the matriarch is just emotionally confusing and confused.  There is no place in this film to ""hang your hat"" and it comes off as a bad French film looking for some continuity and clarity which never materializes.  I avoided this film for a long time and wish I had continued to do so.  Two stars because the actors, an incredibly talented cast, gave it their best shot.",1329177600,,975,4.755952380952381
4899936,5,B005WTG6MK,"Sam Levinson wrote and directed this Official Sundance Film Festival Winner.  The movie is co-produced by Ellen Barkin and applies a hauntingly moody soundtrack (Olafur Arnalds), lending another character to this already over-crowded weekend wedding in Annapolis. An unflinchingly dialog-driven story of a family during a very short time without previous character building.  It's really not necessary to know these people any more than you are shown, only to see the dysfunction of the direct and indirect families. This is not a feel-good movie as the title facetiously implies - ""Another Happy Day"" - quite to the contrary as this is filled to overflowing with melodramatic conflict. We meet Lynn (Ellen Barkin), the mother of two sons who remain living at home with her.  The eldest, Elliot (Ezra Miller is a standout), is in-and-out of rehab and full of his own personal demons.  The youngest son, Ben, says about himself that he has ""a bit of Asperger's [syndrome]"".

Lynn is agitated and hurriedly driving to get to the event. Ben is videotaping her while she's being sarcastically interviewed about her family issues by Elliot.  In Elliot's usual caustic manner, he questions Lynn to the point of explosion, causing Lynn to shout at her son to ""shut off the f*ing camera"".  This gives an ominous introduction to what they are heading into; a maelstrom of familial Discord.  Dylan, Lynn's son from her previous marriage to Paul (Thomas Haden Church), is getting married at the family estate.  Living in the home is her mother, Doris (Ellen Burstyn), and father, Joe (George Kennedy).  Joe is in very poor physical health while Doris is blatantly cold and insensitive to her own children; Lynn and her two sisters. Of these four women in the family dynamic, Lynn seems to be the only one with any feelings and they are understandably quite damaged.  Her two sisters remain gossipy and emotionally vacant throughout the weekend; backbiting and obnoxious.  They all offer neither support for Lynn nor any advice in dark times such as these.

Paul has re-married Patty (Demi Moore), who is completely selfish and vengeful toward others although she did help to raise Dylan.  Paul and Lynn's fragile daughter, Alice (Kate Bosworth), is also coming to her brother's wedding. I wanted to protect her from her own family as she is extremely vulnerable. While their son Dylan is highly favored by Paul, in contrast, Alice has been neglected by her father and is now very self-destructive because of these issues.  Lynn plays defense for her daughter during the weekend while Alice apprehensively tries to get to know people in the family better.  Her father wants to get to know her more as he now realizes how his abstinence has affected her, it's all too little and definitely too late.  Alice is so weakened that she cannot attach to her father any longer and has many problems with relating to others in general.

Throughout the weekend, the teenage cousins remain unsupervised and deceptively do whatever they have a mind to, especially Elliot.  Lynn tries always to gain control of her children, stay aware of her dubious family, and remain available for a socially inhibited Alice.  This pushes her to the point of emotional exhaustion several times.  She must get through the never-ending arguments with Paul and Patty's jealous rages that reach the extreme of literally choking Lynn. She is constantly anxious and walking on eggshells while keeping up her tough facade, although her emotions undermine her every time.  Lynn's 'problem' (If you would call it such) is that she is able to feel within a family that has no consideration for others, empathy, or sympathy.

The ending will linger with you.  This is an exhausting film as it pulls your emotions in all directions; an extremely harsh reality for some families ...",1328140800,26,3830,4.995275590551181
4899937,5,B005WTG6MK,"I was strangely riveted throughout this movie. I can see why some people might not like it. Go into your kitchen if you want something sugar-coated.

4899939,2,B005WTG6MK,"A good cast of seasoned performers works hard to make ""Another Happy Day"" into a kind of ""Ordinary People"" but they are saddled with an unwieldy script and way, way too much dialog.  Demi Moore does a good job as the very  histrionic and controlling stepmother; Thomas Hayden Church plays himself, essentially, as the estranged father trying to reconnect with his adult daughter.  The son, Elliott, played by a newcomer, is superb as an addicted adolescent whose mother covers over his drug problem with psychobabble and her own emotional issues. Ellen Barkin's overdramatization wears thin by the end of the movie.  Tears are shed, regrets are dwelled upon, old wounds clawed open, rivalries explored, etc etc.  It was a little too close to real life for my taste and its hard to imagine the audience this would appeal to.  There isn't a narrative arc in this film. No one changes, there is no central conflict, and basically not a lot happens.  I gave it two stars because it's better than the stuff they used to show on Mystery Science Theater :-)",1327622400,5,1050,4.767955801104972

But americans will reject anything that isn't too happy talk boosteristic- look at news anchors- gabbling along as they sell their items- shallow as parking lot puddles.

When they arrive tensions begin to mount as Lynn's son, her mother, her father, and her ex husband and his new wife all try to coexist for a weekend. This is a hard movie to review as well as watch. The movie itself is not that exciting and if it was not for the amazing cast I would have shut it off. This is a movie that reminded me a little of ""Rachel Getting Married"" in the way that it revolves around a dysfunctional family at the time of a normally happy occasion. The problems ultimately overshadow the wedding and the spiral continues until the ending that feels like a slap to the face after watching the struggling family. The title is very ironic. This is not a happy movie at all, and one of the most depressing movies to come out in a long time. Overall, a very OK movie but because of the cast you stay interested until the end. A good one time watch. I give it a B-.",1324166400,4,1032,4.190954773869347

Unfortunately, it was a movie about a grossly dysfunctional family forced to be together for a wedding...the battles, both emotional and physical never let up the entire movie...the nonstop crying and yelling  and fighting was not enlightening or thoughtful, just boring and ridiculously melodramatic and depressing....what was the point of a movie where people are so screwed and yet  for decades, have made no progress or resolution of their issues. The only one who made any progress was the daughter Alice who had not seen her father for 7 yrs and she asked if she could spend a lunch with her Dad alone, he made it clear that no, he would bring her stepmom. She then made a very non emotional decision and said no to him, she would not talk to him. The one who was portrayed to be most emotional fragile and damaged was the strongest.

I'm amazed they managed to figure out how to feed themselves. Coarse, vile, vulgar, cowardly, drunken, addicted, narcissistic, infantile, but let me tell you how I really feel. Watching these imbeciles wallow in self pity and anger over petty deeds from the distant past is torturous. One hopes this is not a reflection of the average because it would propel any virtuous individual out of the country in a nanosecond. These morons don't seem to have a clue about simple concepts like chivalry, courtesy, honor, modesty, truthfulness, or any other virtue. They are clearly a product of the absurd ""self esteem"" movement popularized by trust fund babies, where concluding a stint in rehab is considered an achievement.

4899950,5,B005WTG6MK,"From reading several of the other reviews, it appears the subject matter was lost on many viewers. One reviewer refers to the Ellen Burstyn character as a ""lovely woman"". By all appearances, she is, which makes this gruesome and abusive character all the more interesting. Ellen Burstyn does it again, only this time, she plays a Covert Narcissist. The subtle and not--so-subtle interplay between the Narcissistic (and cruel) mother, her scapegoat daughter, Ellen Barkin, and the sisters renders a portrayal of a woman suffering from not only the abuse/neglect from her childhood but from the chronic invalidation from her ""mother"" in her adult life. Ellen Barkin's portrayal of a very damaged, needy, and confused DONM (daughter of a narcissistic mother) who is shamed and shunned by all the other women in her life, including her ex husband's new wife (also a malignant narcissist) is brilliant. The audience not only gets to see but also feel Barkin's pain as she tries to hold her life together, understand why she ""is the way she is"". The character believes, all along, that she is 'defective' when, in fact, the dysfunction lies within her mother; her father too, for enabling his wife. As things begin to fall apart, the audience sees Barkin's character begin to figure out that....she is never going to be able to ""figure it out"". That is the insidious nature of NPD. It is a shame most people do not know what this movie is about. I would place this film in the #1 position for DONMs. It blows ""Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood"" to smithereens because it is realistic. There is no ""happy ending"" for adult children who were unfortunate enough to have had a mother with this disorder; lack of empathy, neglect, gas-lighting, lack of attunement, cruelty, and self-involvment to the detriment of at least one if not all of her children. The actors clearly demonstrate the dynamic of triangulation and one can actually feel Barkin's isolation within her large and seemingly ""happy"" family. Ellen Barkin aptly captures feelings of emptiness and longing for her mother's love and validation. It is excruciating to watch as this character comes to terms with loss and wanted reconciliation which will never take place.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who is or was neglected and abused by their mother. For those who believe Ellen Burstyn to be portraying a loving mother and devoted wife who is the victim of her daughter's (Ellen Barkin's) ""dysfunction"", give this film another go.",1383350400,9,2499,4.964200477326969
4899951,4,B005WTG6MK,"Dysfunctional families have long been the fodder for film makers. Like any type of movie they achieve varying degrees of success. This, for my dollar, is one of the better ones.

Here's the scoop. Ellen Barkin is headed to Annapolis, MD., with her two boys, to attend the wedding of her oldest son who has been living with her divorced husband. Her oldest daughter will meet her there and it will be a dicey situation to say the least. Being that some of these folks haven't seen each other in years, they're not quite certain what to expect or how to act.

I am almost always in awe of these kinds of movies because plot takes a back seat to character and they seem so impossible to write. Writer/director Sam Levinson has done a good job here. There are a lot of characters to keep track of and a very fluid dynamic. Being that he's had only one previous writing credit and only 4 acting credits, it's something that the producers would give him, not only a green light on this, but an awesome cast to work with.

These are some screwed up people. Barkin is divorced and she's raised three of her four kids. Two of the three are really screwed up and the third was told he was autistic but he seems normal. The oldest son, who was raised by dad, and whose wedding they're attending seems completely normal, so the finger is pointing at Barkin as being the 'Typhoid Mary' of dysfunction. She's pretty far gone herself and seems to always put herself at the center of the conversation and butt heads with everyone else there. Her older son, Elliot, is very bright and a real character,but is regularly in and out of rehab. The daughter cuts herself and is studying child psychology. Not a fun bunch.

Some like this film more than others. I, myself, have questions. Barkin's ex, at one point in their marriage, punched her in the face. He doesn't seem a bad guy, so what happened? Did she goad him into it? Had he finally had it up to his throat with her? His new wife (Demi Moore) has had no problem with him. They allude to Barkin's wealth. The significance of this escapes me. There are other things but, for me, the good here far outweighs the bad.

If these kinds of films float your boat this should do you just fine.",1381363200,2,2223,4.412195121951219
4899952,4,B005WTG6MK,"This film is not for the faint hearted, but it is a genuine look at the backbone of a family. Open and unresolved issues are around every turn, and this may make you feel better about your family.

Ellen Barkin produced this film, and Sam Levinson wrote and directed. Ellen Barkin plays Lynn, a wife, mother and woman at her neediest. Her mother Ellen Burstyn, is a lovely matriarch of the family, and George Kennedy the ill and slightly demented father. All the children are on their way home to the family compound in Maryland for the wedding of Lynn's estranged son, Dylan. It seems someone abuse took place in Lynn's first marriage and her husband took the son and Ellen the daughter. The daughter, Alice never recovered from her father's lack of live and cuts herself. Lynn has two sons with her new husband, and Elliott, played by Ezra Miller is uniquely observant and addicted to all kinds of meds. The younger son has Aspergers.

Here they aren't the wedding, where nothing goes smoothly. Lynn seems to bevtheonlynonevwith emotions. Her two sisters cope with drink and gossip.  The ex-husband Paul is a doozy and his new wife played by Demi Moore put the cap on the entire weekend. Two traumatic events collide and the family deals with these events as they always do. Another Happy Day, no way, Hose!

Wonderfully acted and moving film.

4899953,5,B005WTG6MK,"I don't know why I like this film so much. A family gathers and argues. The arguing escalates. Ellen Barkin breaks down (her performance will rip your heart out) and her family shows its teeth. The ultimate dysfunctional family, with countless problems.

And yet, who is it that sticks by her in the film's final scenes? Her children. Who, as it turns out, have given her the most stress throughout the entire film.

In this odd way the film is strangely touching. And not only in the ending...in what is perhaps the film's most beautiful moment, Ellen Barkin walks outside, weeping uncontrollably, and collapses by a tree. Her conflicted son enters the frame, sits down in the grass, and the two weary souls embrace.

Talk about emotional cinema.

THAT'S it! The reason why I like this film so much: its overflowing with emotion. Be it good or bad (and usually both within one scene) each character demonstrates a wide range of emotion. Ellen Barkin especially.

She owns this film. It is very much HER story, even though many other characters are given plenty of screen-time. The actions and side stories of others directly affect her. In many ways she is the glue holding the family together. The only problem is...she dried up before the film even begins.

Melodrama. Good, old-fashioned human interaction. Very entertaining here.

I was surprised by this film. Its ended up being one of my favorites. Movie: 5/5 stars.

The DVD has good video, considering its not blu-ray. Currently this film isn't available on blu-ray in the US. The video quality is average for a newer DVD release. Video: 4/5 stars.

The audio is a hit and miss. The film's music is extremely moving, often times acting as the nail in the coffin during many emotional scenes, and is presented well on the DVD. The dialogue can be heard okay, but in a few quieter scenes they could have spoke a little louder. When they're screaming at each other, its great. Audio: 4/5 stars.

Overall: 5/5 stars. Not exactly a ""feel-good"" movie, although I find many scenes to be oddly touching. I recommend it to fans of ""different"" films, as well as fans of any of the actors in the film, they all do exceptional work.

Rating: Rated R. Strong language throughout the film. Verbal bullying takes place, which may make some viewers uncomfortable. Some of the characters display signs of extreme emotional stress, this will make many viewers feel drained. This is an adult film. Some brief graphic nudity in one scene. Some characters use drugs dangerously, this might disturb some viewers. Ages 18 and up.",1369353600,2,2565,4.806818181818182

4899967,3,B005WTG6MK,"""Another Happy Day"" is yet another dysfunctional family-themed drama written and directed by Sam Levinson (his directional debut). The film stars Ellen Barkin (who also produced) as Lynn Hellman, who is going to attend the wedding of Dylan (Michael Nardelli), her beloved son with her ex-husband Paul (Thomas Haden Church). Lynn does not like the idea of meeting Paul and his new wife Patty (Demi Moore) as her first marriage ended in a very acrimonious divorce. And Lynn's two sons Elliot (Ezra Miller) and Ben (Daniel Yelsky) are not very helpful.

The film offers some darkly funny moments, but it does not give us a single reason why we should be staying with these mostly annoying characters for nearly two hours. Of course, in comedies or serious dramas, you are often fascinated with these ""annoying people"" and the ways they behave, especially when they offer something funny or insightful, which we could hardly find in ""Another Happy Day.""

For Sam Levinson, who should have handled each scene more carefully as director, tries so hard to show how messed-up these people are, that there is little room left for empathy. Though the actors all did a fine job, the character they play repeat the same things over and over again, except a few moments where these talented actors are allowed to show what they can do, like Ellen Barkin's Lynn, who finds herself unable to speak when asked to make a speech.

This is where ""Another Happy Day"" is most impressive. Equally impressive is Kate Bosworth as Alice, very vulnerable and sensitive, whose role is, brief as her screen time is, most convincing. With the characters emoting to each other and the film's heavy-handed attempt at satire, ""Another Happy Day"" goes on too long. What it needs is emotions in restraint, not in excess.",1356566400,,1786,4.887788778877888

8488107,4,B005WTG6MK,"This film seems like another fraught and pretentious drama with the standard formula: a family gathers for a wedding or a funeral, and all their dysfunction is revealed. The characters are written not so much as flawed human beings, but as stereotypes of every trendy disorder in the DSM V.  You have borderline personality disorder in the daughter Alice (Kate Bosworth) who is a cutter and probably anorexic; passive-agressive narcissism in the mater familia (Ellen Burstyn); histrionic personality disorder in Patty (Demi Moore), who also serves as the cliched, inappropriately sexual wicked stepmother. The main character, Lynne (Ellen Barkin) is the long-suffering family scapegoat who suffers from depression.  Her youngest son has Asberger's. The men in the film are stereotypically portrayed as oblivious and in denial (Jeffrey DeMunn), or distant and insensitive (Thomas Haden Church.)  At the center of it all is Eliot (Ezra Miller)--the substance-abusing, possibly bipolar middle son who acts as the Greek chorus for the family's dysfunctional shenanigans. All this Psych 101 stuff could get tiresome pretty quickly. What saves this film from being relentlessly bleak and cliched is the darkly funny dialogue, which brings much-needed comic relief,  and the performances of an ensemble of consummate actors, the two Ellen B's especially. But the biggest reason to watch this film? Two words: Ezra Miller.  Wow. This kid is a revelation, a gifted young actor with a unique, startlingly beautiful face. He is a rising star who steals every picture he's in.  So while this can get tiresome in its reduction of characters to Psych 101 stereotypes, it is well written and very funny in spots. And his performance alone is worth the price of admission.",1451347200,2,1756,5.298561151079137
