I know some might have the issue with the age gap and all that but I mean, come on, there has been worse. The drama between the characters, the love triangle, the backstabbing of teenage girls, the insecurity and portrayal of a woman who doesn't know what love is, how to show it or how to receive it make this such an endearing show. I only wish that there would have been a bit more of the two of them for the finale.",1525824000,,567,4.071428571428571
