8314522,4,B001KANIJE,"This fifth edition of the Banned! in America shockumentary film series contains graphic footage of death and violence and came out in the year of 2000 showing scenes of blood and gore. I have not seen this entire movie, however, but it was good. Notable footage in this volume includes an accident involving a F/A-18 Jet that exploded while in the air that killed a navy officer, which happened at China Lake, California, on May 7, 1989.",1503705600,,437,4.688311688311688
8314523,4,B001KANIJE,"I got this for a friend of mine for his birthday, as we are both fans of the series. I chose to watch it beforehand due to people complaining about bootlegs floating around on amazon. Just so you know I got mine from newtownvideo . The video quality is not the best but if you have ever seen brain damage 'shock' documentaries that is just the way they are, also DVD-RW is the disc format brain damage films uses. I was happy to find the video was not a bootleg and in original packaging. Graphic and gruesome as ever.
Hope this review helps and stay spooky my friends!",1487635200,,569,4.277777777777778

8314526,4,B001KANIJE,"If you don't have a strong stomach or even really stiff nerves don't watch this. It really doesn't get any more real than what is contained within this volume. It's pure shock value is in it's reality. Live video of suicide, car crashes, beatings, riots, and at points just the bizarre. I have watched and looked at a ton of this stuff and some of the content is bone chilling. The real negative is the terrible backing soundtrack. That alone frays the nerves in it's pure irritating form. Does add to the creepy atmosphere though. Consider just how hardcore you're willing to go.",1358985600,,580,4.640776699029126
8314527,3,B001KANIJE,SEEEN THESE YEARS AGO . DIDNT WATCH THEM ALL. WISH I NEVER BOUGHT THEM. BUT I HAVE THEM NOW AND ILL KEEP THEM TIL SOMEONE HAPPENS ALONG WHO MIGHT WANT THEM.,1340150400,,156,4.064516129032258
8314528,2,B001KANIJE,"Only the 1st DVD is worth watching. All 5 other ones are nothing but still pictures of dead people and same stuff shows in all of them. Quality of the videos are horrible. Looks like everything was recorded in the 70s or 80s. Very disappointed, but again if you think the $$$ is worth it for only 1 DVD go ahead.",1337212800,2,312,4.131147540983607
8314529,2,B001KANIJE,"Pix quality is bad and this is being nice!!!  Sound was ok!!!  They reused some videos 2 or 3 times throughout the set and have these DUMB sceens with their uncle!!!  THIS IS/WAS A CHEAP HACK AT THE REAL FACES OF DEATH which I own and give 5-STARS to (FACES OF DEATH NOT BANNED IN AMERICA)!!!!!!!!!!!  If you bought it RETURN IT ASAP DON'T EVEN WHATCH IT, IT SUKS

8314530,4,B001KANIJE,"This set is great but you better have a iron stomach as this is about as gruesome as it gets. This is NOT for kids and in fact should only be watched by 18 or older. If you like real death, you will like these!",1282521600,13,210,3.688888888888889
8314531,4,B001KANIJE,"This is a collection of some of the things the censors don't want you to see. Its gruesome, bloody, gory and entertaining all wrapped in one. With live suicides, executions and some stupid human behavior. This is definitely not for the faint of heart and the warning at the beginning of the DVD should not be ignored. If you haven't seen any of the Faces Of Death, you should watch it just to prepare yourself as this is much... Much more graphic and everything is 100% real.

But nonetheless this is a good buy for the mondo or exploitation film lover.",1274313600,20,553,4.475247524752476
