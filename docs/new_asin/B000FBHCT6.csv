THE PRIDE OF JESSE HALLUM (1981- Made for TV) starring Johnny Cash as an illiterate coal minor who comes to the big city with his daughter, who needs spinal surgery.

THE CONFLICT (1973- made for TV) also titled ""Catholics"", starring Martin Sheen as a priest who has to convince a stubborn Irish community to accept the new liturgy of the Catholic Church.

ESCAPE FROM SORBIBOR (1987- Made for TV) Sorbibor was the only concentration camp that had at least a partially successful escape.  Alan Arkin is great as always but the rest of the cast is beyond terrible!

MARK OF THE HAWK (1958) with Sidney Poitier and Eartha Kitt in colonial Africa.  Serious film but Eartha still manages to get a musical number in!

CROSSBAR (1979- made for TV) starring Brent Carver as an ummm..... one-legged Olympic high-jumper [!?!]

BALLAD OF ANDY CROCKER (1969- made for TV) Lee Majors as a Vietnam vet who comes home to find that - surprise! - his girl has married someone else.  Cast also includes Joey Heatherton, Agnes Moorhead, Pat Hingle and - whoa! - Marvin Gaye!!!

FIREHOUSE (1973- made for TV) with Richard Roundtree dealing with racial tension as the first black fireman in an all-white firehouse.

THE STARS THAT LOOK DOWN (??) I've no idea, unless it's the British 1940 film directed by Carol Reed.  That is supposed to be excellent, but I doubt it would be included with 1960s and 70s TV-movies.

CRY OF THE PENGUINS (1971) This IS a British film starring John Hurt as a biologist studying penguins.

The films are presented in full frame with virtual surround 5.1, and include such extras as a Johnny Cash bio, the classic radio episode of ""Blind Courage"", and assorted movie trailers.  If the quality of these films are anything like the quality of the CONFLICT DVD I recently rented, be prepared to have a bottle of Visine by your side!  Still, you can't beat the price, and judging by the talent - especially if you love rather cheesy 60s and 70s TV-movies - this is certainly worth checking out!",1151884800,4,2031,4.711048158640226
