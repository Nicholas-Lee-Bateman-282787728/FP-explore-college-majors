7809762,5,6301169735,I thought this was a very gripping and a well made movie but NOT very much chemistry between these two but they really tried and they did create a gripping movie in spite of the chemistry between the two because I think they BOTH are GREAT actors but just not together.,1416960000,,269,4.294117647058823
7809763,4,6301169735,"I enjoyed watching this movie.  While Joe Penny is believable and good as Eddie, I did not feel Melissa Gilbert was the best ""match up"".  Possibly, a ""stronger"" type actress?
I also felt the story had some ""weak"" moments.  But, overall, it's definitely worth getting!",1359244800,,267,4.888888888888889

7809768,5,6301169735,"This was an excellent story of a mafia family which was very powerful and ruthless.  Joe Penny did a superb job as Melissa Gilbert's husband.  At first he courted her, and it showed how much he loved her and how very much she loved him.  But then as mafia business and revenge grew, he changed and could not disappoint the family.  Melissa suddenly realized what she had gotten into and she tried desperately to leave the family, but was not successful.  She is a wonderful actress and showed how innocence and naivete came to be her downfall.  I loved this movie!!",1054857600,9,565,4.544554455445544
7809769,4,6301169735,"Another romantic-tragedy for Joe..  Good story, it was interesting seeing Melissa Gilbert in something other than ""Little House"".  Joe was cool and good looking as usual.
Die hard Joe Penny fans will enjoy.",1035244800,4,206,5.212121212121212
