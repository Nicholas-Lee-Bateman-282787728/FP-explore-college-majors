I go regularly to Chicago, NYC and have been to Detroit and Flint, but the most segregated--or, perhaps more accuratey, ""African-American"" city--I've ever visited was Washington D.C. on three occasions in the '90s.  That detail matters for a film like this to drive home its point about what ails America, what's right, what's broken, what can be fixed.

The story centers on two young men, barely in their 20s, both of whom happen to be single-parent fathers.  Rico is trying to better himself in order to be the best father to his pre-schooler son; his best friend Scooby shares almost the identical situation, except his parental responsibility is to his bright, fast-growing little girl.  Rico is the more quiet and laid-back of the pair, waiting for Scooby to come up with a plan of action for the evening.  Although Scooby takes the initiative, his authority is humorously undercut each time he reaches down to pull up his pants, which he seems to be conflicted about: on the one hand, it seems clear that he wants his low-riding hip-hopper trousers to drop low enough to display his colorful briefs; on the other hand, he possesses some sense of propriety and adult responsibility as a parent.

Scooby's problem with his pants is an image that represents the conflict both characters experience between wanting to be free-ranging boys and wanting the best for their own kids at home.  In the end, the film is a love story--between parents and children, between two close friends (who are not ""too cool"" to proclaim their love for one another); and between the hood and its 1000 pound pig.

The film also captures the black vernacular like no other movie that comes to mind.  ""What are they saying? How do they understand each other?""  Those were the questions I had throughout the film. Like large but sequestered families, these characters seem to be members of an extended, isolated  community of African-Americans that has developed its own system of signs and words--a ""signifying monkey"" except in the 21st century and in a large metropolitan area.

But in one telling scene, Scooby speaks in universally understood and ""approved"" English when he asks his daughter if she's been working on ""learning her numbers"" and her ""A B C's.""  One language is an identity marker--at once a protective shield and a banner of pride; the other is the language of opportunity, of ""code-shifting"" for the sake of the two young men's own prospects but even more for their kids (who are only 17 years younger than their fathers).

Charlotte is in two of the movie's five ""acts,"" and she's worth the wait.  Against the odds, Charlotte has been embraced by the community for 2  years (most livestock pigs are ""processed"" at the age of six months) and seems stubbornly attached to the 'hood in which she is highly regarded as a key member.  When Animal Cruelty steps in and forcibly removes Charlotte from her ""home,"" we sense her life is about to end--either at the processing plant or by another means.  Many pigs are unsuccessfully relocated, despite the best intentions.  Removing them from the ""herd family"" they have adopted as their own is tantamount to depriving them of identity and life.  A pig that's placed in a sanctuary by a family that no longer wants it or is able to house it, frequently cannot even relate to its own kind and succumbs to morbid depression.

Fortunately, the outcome for Rico and Scooby seems more sanguine.  The two boys have each other in addition to their two children.  Moreover, they have taken responsibility for a young dog, taking its welfare seriously while seeking to place it in receptive hands.  By the end of the story, we learn that they've succeeded in selling the animal for a profit--an omen of better things for all concerned.",1462579200,,3913,4.813153961136024

8740933,5,B017X7UO9E,"Sweaty Betty is one of a kind.  Filmed as a documentary with some reenactment it brings you into the hearts, lives and dreams of people living in the hood.  The story of Charlotte the pig groomed to be the Redskins Mascot and other side stories reveal the resourcefulness of people living in a neighborhood that provides little opportunity for its residents. The strength and commitment of the two young fathers to their children will also touch your heart..  The film has moments of pathos, tenderness and humor.",1454025600,2,513,4.873563218390805
