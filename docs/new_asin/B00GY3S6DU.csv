8628584,5,B00GY3S6DU,Great story plot and builds sympathy for the female lead character as it progresses. Glad it had a happy ending or it would have been depressing. Bears close watching to understand how the various characters evolve under difficult and sometimes surprising circumstances. One of the best anime series I've seen in recent years. Done is very good taste and equates with social problems that exist today!,1428796800,3,401,5.090909090909091
8628585,5,B00GY3S6DU,"I first saw this Anime on Youtube long time ago. I forgotten about. So I pick it up. Good story and artwork.
The story is about life good and the bad. In the end, it has a good ending!",1416009600,3,184,3.7435897435897436
