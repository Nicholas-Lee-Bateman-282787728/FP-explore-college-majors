5721321,5,B00CFCTFJ8,I gave this as a gift to my best friend and she was very pleased.  I think we will both enjoy watching it together.,1389139200,,115,3.7916666666666665
5721322,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"It was a gift and he loved it.  He couldn't wait to rush home, shut off the phone and watch it.",1389052800,,95,3.5238095238095237
5721323,4,B00CFCTFJ8,I have loved the band since their early days and saw them twice in Manchester in the 80s. This documentary took me back. they sounded just a fab and i wish they would play here in New York. I would LOVE to see them live again!,1388966400,,226,3.9347826086956523
5721324,5,B00CFCTFJ8,This is a great mix of old and newer footage of a legendary band! Great interview clips and the b/w practice sessions for the tour are awesome!,1388880000,,143,4.333333333333333
5721325,4,B00CFCTFJ8,"Great behind the scenes and concert footage, but would have liked there to have been more live concert and a little less about the people waiting in line to see them. Amazing band!",1386979200,,180,4.484848484848484
5721326,3,B00CFCTFJ8,"Bit of a puff piece. I think the filmmakers love of the band got in the way, frankly.

Adore the Roses, and their music, but if this was any other artist, I'd give this film 1 star. Almost no storytelling of any kind, no drama, no exhausting research into why the band was so epic. No music critics extolling their virtues. You never get any insights into why the band reunited, beyond the original press conference which has been on YouTube.

The 3 star review is really only due to the final 7 minutes of the film: John Squire's face melting solo during their big live debut. If you love the band, this is a must see. If you are indifferent to the band, not much here for you.",1386633600,15,678,4.248062015503876
5721327,3,B00CFCTFJ8,"Good material. It would've been great to see the full concert, but there are only bits of them. Not being a huge fan but liking their music very much, I was hoping to see their concerts, but there are no more than 10 minutes in total.",1385942400,,234,4.108695652173913
5721328,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"Huge Shane Meadows fan, director of THIS IS ENGLAND and this will be a great addition to my rock doc collection. When The Stone Roses reunited and headlined Coachella Music Festival this year most of my American friends didn't know who these guys were or why they never heard of them. If you need to catch up on their music, check out tracks ""This Is The One"" ""I Am the Resurrection"" ""I Wanna Be Adored"" and ""Made of Stone"" to name a few..but definitely see this doc to get the band's full story.",1382140800,13,496,4.344086021505376
5721329,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"Awesome. Wish they would play stateside. My only complaint, and not really a complaint, I cant understand half of what was said. I watched the live footage at the end three additional times.",1483920000,,190,4.787878787878788

5721331,2,B00CFCTFJ8,"Not much substance, alot of live clips to fill it etc. Some might appreciate that but most already on youtube. Not bad but not great",1483574400,,132,4.32

5721342,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"I grew up listening to the stone roses, and firmly believe that for a couple of years they were the best band on earth. Told bad they collapsed. It is great to see the story of their reunion and watch them play once again.",1472774400,,222,4.068181818181818
5721343,3,B00CFCTFJ8,There is nothing very interesting going on here but if you're a fan it is fun nonetheless. This is a doc of their 2013 reunion. That's it. Doesn't even cover all of it but it was fun and harmless.,1472774400,,196,4.051282051282051

5721360,3,B00CFCTFJ8,"Great band, great music.  A lot more could have been made of history and band dynamics, drama and breakups.  The archival footage was the most interesting stuff.  I agree with another review that the filmmakers were probably too smitten with their favorite rock gods to make much of a hard hitting doc.  Still, SRs are unquestionably one of the greatest and most influential bands to have ever existed in their relatively short lived and sporadic career and it's hard to fault them.  Even in their reunion gigs, their music sounds fresh and exciting.  They are definitely not Howard Jones.",1463184000,2,589,4.898989898989899

5721363,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"It is already an hour and 40 min but I do wish it would have covered more of their early days. How they all met and more info on their antics. That aside, it is an awesome movie for any Roses fan. The finale of them playing Fools Gold live and going into a jam session is amazing!",1458000000,,280,3.8448275862068964

5721371,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"Where was I when Stone Roses were first so popular?  Well...it is never too late and now that I know their music, I am certainly enjoying it.  The documentary on their comeback is fascinating.",1446595200,,192,4.617647058823529
5721372,2,B00CFCTFJ8,"I love the Stone Roses but was incredibly disappointed by how little rehearsal or reunion concert footage was included.  When the band announces a free preview concert on Facebook the director chooses to spend an interminable length of time on interviewing the fans who rush to the venue to get and then wait for their wrist bands. A flashback segment focuses on a boorish ""interview"" the band gives with a reporter as they rudely and sullenly dismiss her questions. Footage in cars, on trains, on planes is monumentally uninteresting. These guys play fabulous music....why that was not the sole focus, I do not understand.  When Alan Wren derails the reunion our premiers the director turns the camera on himself to worry about it. Alan is never interviewed (nor is Ian who calls his drummer a c**t when the Amsterdam audience begs for an encore that can't happen without the drummer. Oh well, it was great to hear some tunes in surround sound, but as a film this is a failure.",1446249600,3,978,4.747058823529412

5721375,2,B00CFCTFJ8,"Disappointing.  Felt like most of the film was comprised of street interviews with fans over an in depth documentary.  After watching, i don't think I know much more about the band than before.",1441584000,,193,4.818181818181818

5721379,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"I'm biased because I think their self-titled debut album was brilliant, but I loved it. Maybe the documentary will get some people interested and they'll go out and get it - The Stone Roses were too good to be forgotten. From the documentary, I often replay the beginning slow-motion sequence of ""I Wanna Be Adored"" over and over - gives me chills. A bit off topic, but I always get a kick out of the part in Shaun of the Dead where one of them is about to throw the LP of Second Coming at a zombie and the other says defensively ""I liked it"".",1436227200,,543,4.180952380952381

5721381,4,B00CFCTFJ8,Interesting watch....if you are a fan you will love it. Would have been better with longer clips of the early years but I realize time constraints etc etc etc. Really enjoyed watching the preconcert practice sessions....makes you realize how good they were. I was impressed as well with how well Ian Brown and Remi sang together. Once again...if you were even a semi fan its a worthy watch.,1431820800,,390,4.75
5721382,4,B00CFCTFJ8,I wondered what happened to them. Now I know.,1428710400,,45,4.111111111111111
5721383,4,B00CFCTFJ8,"One the best live performance/rock docs you will ever see.  Shane Meadows reveals himself to be a huge fan and then gives you an unbiased glimpse at the true band.  Told in three scintillating acts, you feel like you are there.  The finale of ""Fool's Gold"" is a locomotive that ultimately proves that all of the fans captured here were right.  Beautifully shot, beautifully edited.  Masterful.",1428019200,,393,4.893939393939394
5721384,4,B00CFCTFJ8,"Good show if you were a fan since back in the day, but nothing too in-depth storywise for anyone who wants to learn the whole back story of The Stone Roses. If you like the music then you should enjoy watching it. If you don't know the music then this film will probably make you a convert.",1427587200,,290,4.105263157894737
5721385,4,B00CFCTFJ8,Really enjoyed this. Great sound and video quality.  Would have liked a bit more on the breakup and where things went wrong but then this was more about the reunion.,1426723200,,165,4.5
5721386,5,B00CFCTFJ8,Amazing documentary on the seminal Manchester band from gritty film maker Shane Meadows. Riveting.,1424649600,,98,6.071428571428571

5721391,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"This was absolutely AMAZING! I wish this band could stay together, but I see they are under so much stress! You brought back so many memories and made my day! I watched with my two year old girl and she danced with me!",1418342400,,218,4.093023255813954
5721392,4,B00CFCTFJ8,"As a hurge fan this was a great film. Because its focused on their reunion it's mostly footage of those activities. However, there are some old pics and video interwoven. Really made me wish they were on tour again.  The live version of Fools Gold at the end is worth the wait, as the band tears through it!",1417996800,,307,4.293103448275862
5721393,5,B00CFCTFJ8,Sadly seems to be just a record of another passing phase in the history of the Roses but essential for any fan from the eighties and nineties. Final concert footage is immense.,1416873600,,176,4.53125

As soon as it finished, I wanted to watch it again.",1416700800,,93,3.7
5721395,5,B00CFCTFJ8,I wish this was a full concert film. It's a nice documentary on the return of the Stone Roses but the snippets of music leave you wanting more. The Fools Gold makes it all worth while. John Squire's use of the Echoplex is fantastic to watch!,1415836800,,241,4.260869565217392
5721396,5,B00CFCTFJ8,A great introduction and,1415145600,,24,5.25
5721397,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"The opening scene may be the best scene in a music documentary I have ever seen. From there the glory continues, with some delighting photos and videos of a very young Stone Roses coupled with thorough background stories, especially of Ian Brown, who is clearly not at all the caustic lad we used to see in interviews. Rather a kind and mellow soul, completely at peace with himself and the world. Also, depictions of a band that has become quite smitten with one another, their careers and their lives. This film reinforces the notion that youth is indeed, generally wasted on the young, but in this story its friendship and the love of playing music together that has prevailed. Turns out what's made of stone is the spirit of this band; not their hearts.",1414800000,,757,4.656716417910448
5721398,2,B00CFCTFJ8,"I'm a huge fan of the band, have been since the early 90's but I was not impressed with this at all. It's basically a chronicle of the reunion tour, lots of great concert footage but zero insight into the band or their heads. The director admits at the beginning that they are his favorite band and he's genuinely starstruck to be doing this, and it shows. This would have been better to be just a concert doc of their reunion, hell there aren't even any modern day interviews of the band members. The archive footage brings up the rift and that the band broke up in the mid 90's but no one ever discusses what exactly happened and why it took them 20 years to figure it out. Awful filmmaking, very disappointing from the standpoint of wanting to learn anything new about the band.",1410912000,3,781,4.393103448275862
5721399,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"I bought this after seeing a commercial on TV - and had a flashback to my college days when the Manchester sound was the scene.
Want I liked most about this was is the build up to the final concert scene. From the announcement of a reunion, through practice sessions, to small venue gigs, leading to bigger and bigger stadiums. Awesome.
Sound and picture quality are great - I'm sure I annoyed my neighbours when I turned up the volume.",1410480000,,436,4.4625

5721401,3,B00CFCTFJ8,Footage of Meadows was dead boring.  Should have been a Stone Roses doc followed by the Heaton Park show.  Rehearsal footage was great.  Movie was well shot.  Was sad for the poor fans who couldn't get into the free show.  Empathize because they never come to the U.S..,1405468800,5,269,4.520833333333333
5721402,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"For fans, this is must see.  For those who don't know the Stone Roses, this can help explain what all the fuss is about.

I really like the style of this documentary, i.e. no ongoing commentary.  The film is told with real footage and solid editing.

I also think the sound was excellent.  Even the taping of the practice sessions sound fantastic.  The live concert footage also has excellent sound.  Turn it up and rock!

The only thing that I didn't like was the editing of the Parr Hall show.  That show deserves to be shown in its entirety.  Same goes for the Heaton Park concert.  They should release both of these separately.",1400803200,,631,4.495575221238938

5721408,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"I was in my 20's during the whole Madchester thing and spent many a happy (hour?) weekend in clubs and fields through-out the 80-90s. Great band that are head and shoulders above most of the one hit wonders and nonsense that were also around at the time. Their first album is constantly voted one of the best albums of all time and I never tire of listening to it, and as such this is a great documentary type film from a fans point of view without becoming too 'gushy' or fawning over the band. Nothing particularly new in it or revealing but still great footage for those of us who never got to see them live.",1394150400,,611,4.275862068965517
5721409,2,B00CFCTFJ8,"This documentary is about 70% fans gawking and squawking over their love of the Stone Roses.  I know the Stone Roses were awesome, I don't need to hear from Joe Nobody that he saw them in a small club before their first album came out.  It would have been infinitely better with more live (er, music) footage than fluff.  It had its brief moments, but in the end all I felt was old and out of $20.",1393977600,4,397,4.12987012987013
5721410,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"Wonderful documentary about a reunion no one thought would happen. The music is incredible, and the obvious love and camaraderie among the band is touching. This film is made out of pure love for the Roses.",1393632000,,206,4.75
5721411,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"It's a film for the hard core fan. If you love the Roses you'll enjoy it. It does go into some background on the band but for a casual observer its not much.
The performance sequences though are simply amazing and remarkably well shot.",1392681600,,235,4.363636363636363
5721412,3,B00CFCTFJ8,Not much else though.  Kind of slogged thru the content myself and I am a big fan of the Stone Roses.  Ian Brown without a producer has his own idea of what is in tune.  I think I would have likes to see a bit more sound checks and warmups than what was presented.,1392163200,2,264,3.8518518518518516
5721413,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"There was nothing else like them. Maybe not as in-depth as I would have preferred, but Shane Meadows is a fan. Fans don't make in-depth, they amplify the fun we have as fans. So, good on him. How much sweeter can you get than when the little girl running with her father to get in line for the free concert says, ""We'll make it, dad.""?",1391990400,2,335,4.1692307692307695
5721414,2,B00CFCTFJ8,Documentaries commissioned by the band and directed by fans are never very good. This doc is a perfect example of that.,1391040000,2,119,4.714285714285714
5721415,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"Nice look into the band's inner workings, and the ups and downs of getting this reunion to go smoothly. Must have for any fan of the group.",1390867200,,139,4.185185185185185
5721416,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"Absolutely loved it, although more rehearsal stuff would have been great. Fools Gold at Heaton Park sounds amazing, would love to see a standalone DVD/Blu-ray of that gig.",1389225600,,171,5.142857142857143
5721417,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"This documentary nicely interweaves recent footage of the Stone Roses rehearsals, interviews and performances with footage from their very beginnings through their temporary disbandment.  Any fan of great rock and roll documentaries like The Who's ""The Kids are Alright"" or the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" or even the spoof documentary, ""This is Spinal Tap"" will enjoy the film's layout.  All fans of great guitar band based rock and roll will appreciate the early and newer performances too.  Turn up the volume for the recent performance of ""Fools Gold"" from their historic Heaton Park reunion show, with sublime extended guitar solo. This was a staple of the Stone Roses' set during their 2013 world tour, but this particular performance has to be one of the best if not the best.",1389225600,4,787,5.0852713178294575

8581263,5,B00CFCTFJ8,Five stars for the live footage of great musicians with some the catchiest songs from 90's britpop. I liked their first album when it came out but I gained a new respect for these guys when I watched this doc and was blown away by just how great they are live these days.,1491091200,,271,4.132075471698113
8581264,5,B00CFCTFJ8,"Interesting/intriguing bio-pic of this notoriously inconsistent & enigmatic group that die-hard fans will love. But, for those not so inclined, probably three stars at best... until, right at the end, when for anyone remotely interested in rock music it's catapulted into the five star category by a thirteen minute work out of ""Fools Gold"" filmed at Heaton Park, Manchester in 2012 that's up there with the very best live tracks I've ever seen on film. Worth the price simply to own this slice of audio-visual brilliance.",1487030400,,522,5.0813953488372094

8581270,2,B00CFCTFJ8,"This doc. kinda dragged on, like the band...know when to end it! Their time to make music has passed, and they missed it. Now they're just a tribute band to themselves, like the Rolling Stones! Funny, maybe if the word ""stone"" is in your name, you're doomed to replay your glory day songs ad nauseam. That said, they're okay...sort of a flash in the pan, jam band version of the Charlatans.",1484870400,,390,4.507042253521127
