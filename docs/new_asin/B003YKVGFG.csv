4230806,4,B003YKVGFG,My boys (2 and 4) love this DVD. The footage is current and well put together. The commentary is a little cheesy but the kids don't mind so that is fine with me.,1307923200,,161,3.909090909090909

4230809,5,B003YKVGFG,This movie is a lot of fun for my three-year-old son and even his 18 month old brother will sit for a few minutes at a time to watch.  The three-year-old can sit through the ENTIRE video without a peep other then how awesome each of the machines is.  He loves the entire Mighty Machines series. I'm not sure of any boys this age that wouldn't love this stuff!,1300924800,2,359,4.188405797101449

4230882,2,B003YKVGFG,"Again, this cd was not what we expected, too boring, not enough action, too much talking.  My grandson will not watch it.

So, had I know I would not have ordered any of them.  We tried to get Crunch/Chop/Tear (I believe that was the name) which my grandson had worn out from watching, but you advised it was no longer available, so I ordered the above, and was completely dissatisfied.",1401494400,,386,4.485714285714286
4230883,5,B003YKVGFG,"Hours of enjoyment my grandson gets out of this dvd he watches it over and over again. Boy, you don't have to wonder what he's doing when  this dvd is playing because he is right in front of the tv.",1392940800,,198,3.95

4230885,5,B003YKVGFG,"My son loves mighty machines.  I bought this as a replacment after a grandmother broke the first one.  How do you break a disk in half?  She did.  Anyway, he was happy to get a new one.",1363478400,,185,3.918918918918919

4230907,3,B003YKVGFG,This CD was okay but I ordered it thinking it was about construction vehicles (hence the cover photo).  The majority of the video features water crafts.  I also ordered the Mighty Machines Diggers And Dozers which was much more of what I was looking for.,1357603200,2,254,4.622222222222222
4230908,5,B003YKVGFG,"My boys are 4, 5 & 7 and they were very happy to have a NEW Mighty Machines to watch!",1355702400,,85,3.3
4230909,5,B003YKVGFG,I never knew that even machines could go to school!  It was a very facinating footage of where machines go when they are resting and not being used.,1354579200,,148,4.285714285714286
4230910,4,B003YKVGFG,"My grandson can watch this over and over.  Also, it is interesting for us as well, unlike animated construction videos.",1344124800,,119,4.95
4230911,5,B003YKVGFG,It's a hit with little boys.  My 5-yr old grandson loves Mighty Machines & this one is his favorite. Put it in a DVD player in your car for trips.,1331683200,,146,3.8666666666666667
4230912,4,B003YKVGFG,"My 4 year old son and I have watched five of the Mighty Machine DVDs over the past few weeks (perhaps too often), and, while I still intend to purchase a copy of this 5 episode collection, I would rank this one as the least favorite so far.  4 of the 5 episodes in this collection are ""newer"" (from season 3 in 2008 vs. season 2 in 2004 and season 1 in 1994).  While the first two seasons seem to focus more specifically on various machines working collectively on specific projects or at specific worksites (i.e., on the farm, at the lumber yard, at the recycling plant, etc.), these particular episodes from season three seem to focus more on a single machine and its function.  The first episode of this collection - GO, BOATS, GO - is a primary example of this.  We're given an individual focus on a hovercraft, an airboat in the everglades, and a luxury paddleboat in British Colombia.  While there's a decent amount of information in this episode, I notice that, at times, my son gets a little bit disinterested with this one.  While some of this may be associated with personal preference, I tend to believe that the lack of interrelated action with multiple machines and the lack of a tangible, goal oriented process make episodes such as this one less enjoyable for young viewers.  Moreover, with the segment highlighting the luxury paddleboat (a.k.a the ""Empress""), it started to feel like the episode was more of a sponsorship from the B.C. board of tourism, and less of a children's educational piece.  (When the ""Empress"" character voice-over says things like ""hey kids, did you know that I'm a floating hotel...Each of my rooms has its own balcony,"" followed by further discussion and images of elegant fine dining, one tends to suspect that the target audience is the parents who are watching the episode with their children).
In spite of these minor flaws, this is still an enjoyable Mighty Machines installment.  The 5 episodes included are: 1) GO, BOATS, GO!  2) MACHINES GO TO SCHOOL (Bulldozers, Graters, Trenchers, and other construction site machines develop their skills at a test site).  3) UNDER THE WAVES (Mainly Submarines and one-man submersibles).  4) BOARD THE FERRY! (Ferry boats that fraternize with each other while they ferry cars and trucks around the B.C. waterways).  5) ALL ABOUT RECYCLING (This was an episode from season 2 - incongruent from the from the other episodes on the DVD - back again to the concept of machines working together, this time in the process of recycling bottles, cans, paper, etc.",1329782400,11,2543,4.805045871559633
4230913,3,B003YKVGFG,"My son likes the names of all the machines and the noises they make, he loves all the machinery and construction trucks so this video is good for that.  But it is too long, gets boring, kinda drags on instead of keeping kids interest.  My son still loves it and it was a good price, under $10, so I still think it is a OK video.
It does have some different machines then what we saw before so my son liked that.
The ""Onsite Bob the Builder"" videos are made way better and more fun, educational.  We have 3 of those.  But for under $10, this video is still a good buy.",1326067200,,567,4.035714285714286
