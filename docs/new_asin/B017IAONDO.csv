8739396,3,B017IAONDO,"I'm a very generous person when it comes to anime, giving each and every series I was a big benefit of the doubt. But, this one really falls short of my expectations. Yes, there is a sumptuous amount of panty shots and fan service, on par with its cousin, Highschool of the Dead anime. However, as in the case when an anime is developed based on an ongoing manga series, you can expect a series that doesn't really wrap itself up very well, It's the case in this series. At only 10 episodes, It feels a bit rushed and some characters are not fully developed. The plot is a bit weak and I really did not develop an affinity with any of the characters. Well, this anime isn't released yet in the US. Sentai Filmworks has the license for it.",1476316800,,738,4.2785714285714285
