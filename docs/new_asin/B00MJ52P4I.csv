Ive done it twice now but I really think I need to try it a few more times before I can give it a full review.  But for now, Id recommend it generally speaking.  Probably the reason that its hard to review is theres a lot to it.  The lake views on the first fifteen-minute or so section are very nice with tall mountains in the background and those fancy Italian towers coming into view as you go through all the little towns.
I really enjoyed the section in Verona- what a romantic place- and also there was a town, I cant remember the name, but it had endless hills of sunlit vineyards and an AWESOME medieval castle on the top of a hill.  And after seeing the castle from a distance, you get to ride up to it and take in the views- a very life-like experience and something Id actually want to do if I was there!  So, ,like I said, theres more to this video that I haven't mentioned but if even for just these parts- all in all, yes its a winner!",1410566400,,1018,4.090452261306533
