8453135,5,B0051S37ME,"I recently streamed this series from my online rental provider, and it was available free as part of my subscription.

Jimmy McGovern, who created this series who also created the very successful series Cracker starring Robbie Coltrane about a criminal profiler with a gambling problem, an absolutely excellent series which was spun off into  a less successful American series.  He also wrote another series called The Street which ran for several seasons in the UK which I have not yet seen.

How it differs from your usual law and order or police procedural is we do not have a recurring cast of characters.  Each episode is entirely self contained with its own cast of characters with little or no overlap.  Each program starts out with someone in a holding cell at the court who is then escorted into a courtroom.  What then follows is the story of how they got there and the outcome.

Often it's regular people who are not habitual criminals who get into a situation through happenstance, and the series explores a variety of themes, of people who have had to make hard choices.  Sometimes the characters are portrayed in a sympathetic light, and the story may have some intriguing red herrings which will keep you guessing until the end.

What does a father do when his daughter comes home from the park in tears and has been molested by a stranger?  What about a guy with financial problems who has to pay for his daughter's wedding, and finds an envelope of money sticking out under the seat of a taxi?

What about a mother on a housing estate ruled by thugs who threaten her life and her livelihood?  Often the story's twists and turns come out of left field.  What about a woman in a nasty custody battle who looks certain of winning except her husband's father is a policeman?

Some of these episodes feature well known actors.  Andy Serkis, who you may know from King Kong and Rise of the Planet of the Apes plays a taxi driver with a gambling addiction problem, who breaks into the house of an attractive female customer and then becomes besotted with her.  I found this episode to be unbelievably creepy, and had to stop watching it at several points, but also had to see it through to the end.

The best episode I think is about the two friends who join the British Army and go to Afghanistan.  One of them them is bullied.  I found this one to be very real, so much so, I wondered if it was based on a real event.  Really outstanding.

Another very strong episode features Sean Bean as as Tracie the Trannie.  You may remember him from his many manly action roles where he often plays the bad guy.  In this, he plays a really bad ugly looking transvestite, who is totally different from his English teacher by day character.

Dressed as the English teacher,  a customer with whom he has developed a relationship passes him by in a mall in broad daylight without recognizing him.  He follows the customer, and things happen.

There is the story of a boy who suspects that his mother's nurse poisoned her.  She then moves in with his father.  His suspicions may be delusional, or......

Jimmy McGovern clearly is a tremendously skilled writer who plays with our expectations and keeps us guessing, and I suspect that as with Cracker this could be developed into an American series, and like Cracker I doubt that such a series would hold a candle to the original.

I think with McGovern there is hope for the human condition, a crime may be committed to protect those one loves. In some situations if there no hope, then there is justice.

I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful.",1383609600,4,3606,4.566978193146418

I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this you will not be disappointed!  except for not being able to get in here in the US!",1348272000,6,337,3.8260869565217392
8453137,5,B0051S37ME,"This series is highly emotional, complicated, stressful and unpredictable.
I watched each story, there are 6, and I literally wrung my hands and dreaded what would be the outcome...guilty or innocent.  There are good and bad events and alot of gray in the judgement of the facts that are not simple and often painful.  The 6 stories are an experience even for those who think they have seen every version of a crime or injustice on film.  That alone holds your interest and concern.

I highly recommend it. The writing, acting and directing is the best.",1342137600,5,553,4.729166666666667
