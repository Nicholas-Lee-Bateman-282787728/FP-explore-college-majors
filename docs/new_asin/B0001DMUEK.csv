1991558,5,B0001DMUEK,Excellent story with outstanding acting. My opinion is that it personifies a five star film.,1142899200,3,92,5.2
1991559,5,B0001DMUEK,"This is one of those series that just improves with age!  The writing for this show is terrific.  The characters are developed so well.  The scenary is magnificant!  It's been several years since I've been in Scotland but this show reminds me of how and why I fell in love with that country in the first place!

I've seen so many episodes of this series that I'm beginning to think of all of them as family.  Certainly they're as quirky as my own! The understated humor is just terrific.  I just wish BBC would release the individual series to the U.S. a little sooner.  It's my understanding we're behind by a couple series.

Watch them!  You won't be disappointed!",1109548800,8,666,4.5210084033613445
1991560,5,B0001DMUEK,"Monarch of the Glen is an incredibly solid, well-crafted series from BBC Scotland, and the first two seasons are exactly where a newcomer should begin.  Although the individual episodes are self-contained (and usually include multiple storylines), there is a strong continuity among the characters that  requires chronological viewing.  Series one is the slower of the two here, with so many characters to be introduced and established, but the momentum builds and by series two events are really bouncing along at Glenbogle, the fictitious (but built on solid foundations) Highland estate of young Archie MacDonald. And series three and four are even better.

Impeccably scripted and performed, MOTG brings us the (mis)adventures and troubled relationships of the MacDonald family of Glenbogle plus their assorted friends, families, retainers, and interlopers.  Each episode lasts less than an hour, but they are so tightly written and fast-paced that you feel you've watched a full-length feature film every time.  This is quality stuff, folks, chock-full of bittersweet romance, generational conflict, the struggle to balance traditional virtues in a modern world, and classic British eccentricity on parade.  Richard Briers and Susan Hampshire are particularly marvelous as the doting (and dotty) Hector and Molly MacDonald, Laird and Lady of Glenbogle, but the show revolves around their son Archie (Alastair Mackenzie) and his pursuit of the woman of his dreams (whoever she may be)  along with  elusive financial solvency for the aging estate.  Each episode brings Archie new challenges on both fronts.  Can he possibly sort out his love life before his parents drive him crazy?  Will Glenbogle again escape the grasping claws of  creditors,  tax-assessors, and meddling politicians?  Will Lord Kilwillie ever manage to boast of the ""Tallest Tree in Scotland"" or make off with Hector's prize cask of single-malt whisky?  The terrific supporting cast and guest stars make this show a treat for any Scot-ophile, and the  scenery will make you want to plan your next vacation in the Highlands. Charming as a day in Brigadoon, without the Clan Bogus kitsch.",1108080000,24,2160,5.4
1991561,5,B0001DMUEK,"Run and purchase this 'sleeper' of a series. What marvelously secretive characters...what surprises...what delicious machinations, unexpected!

The scenery, alone, is worth it all.

Nothing else to say but, with extraordinarily good casting and talent, this is a joy to be savored VERY slowly, indeed! Revel in it...",1097452800,10,316,5.702127659574468
1991562,5,B0001DMUEK,"This is a series that makes one wish for the Scottish Highlands.  It is beautifully written, has breathtaking scenery, and it an easy way to spend a few hours.

Transporting the viewer into the world of Young Laird MacDonald, and the mishaps that plague him at every turn, it quickly engrosses the viewer into the life and moral struggles he faces as he comes to terms with his unwelcomed birthright.  Although longing for the independent life he has created, he is dedicated to his family, especially his mother, and does his best to rectify the damage done to his family's assets by years of neglectful management by his father.

The stories move quickly, and are filled with colorful characters, fast and light humor, and scenery of a beautiful country, which is a supporting character in its own right.  The costuming is fun, the dialogue appropriate for the setting, and the native wildlife interacted with respectfully.  It is sure to be a crowd pleaser, but people who are not familiar with the Scottish brogue or common Scottish slang may have a difficult time with comprehending the supporting characters and their conversations with one another.

Monarch of the Glen is appropriate for most general audiences.  There is some mild violence, some inferred mature themes, and some mild oath muttering, but nothing that should be considered offensive to even the most sensitive viewer.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a good story, especially those who enjoy the setting of the beautiful Scottish Highlands.",1094428800,15,1525,5.01984126984127
1991563,5,B0001DMUEK,"Monarch of the Glen is a wonderful Drama brought to us by the BBC Scotland and Ecosse Films. It has fun, lighthearted comedy, romance and whimsey. It is appropriate for all ages, races and backgrounds.

This is just the best programme on television, pure blissful escapism. The beautiful scenery and the greatest characters. Drama, romance and comedy in bucketfuls!

This show has captured my heart. Immense beauty, exciting and real characters, true and truly felt writing, and wonderful actors are only some of the reasons that I can not and will not do without this show.

Monarch of the Glen is a beautiful programme which manages to combine romance, comedy and drama all before the watershed. It appeals to the whole family and the actors are all fantastic. The storylines are great, with many twists and turns but always ending like a fairytale. The amazing scenery is magical and it really takes away the dreading of monday mornings. It is shown in 44 countries and all boglies (fans of monarch) are now eagerly awaiting series six. It has 50 million viewers worldwide and after watching just one episode you'll see why.",1093478400,10,1127,4.890052356020942
1991564,5,B0001DMUEK,"I have watched many BBC productions, but this is the greatest of all, I wish they would hurry and release 3 & 4.  For 4 nights I have watched the program and have decided to keep this set and not sell as I do with so many others.  I will watch them again when they release the others.  Archie is the best, Hector is the funniest and I love all things Scottish.  If you have a chance to buy this set, go ahead you won't be sorry.  Ellie",1085011200,19,435,3.897727272727273
1991575,5,B0001DMUEK,"Seasons one and two are hands-down the best two seasons. The third season starts to lose some steam and by the time one of the most memorable (and lovable) characters leaves, it just isn't the same.  I cannot say enough about this series-it is smart and hysterically (roll on the floor) funny.  If you have seen The Churchills, you will remember Susan Hampshire who plays the lady of the estate in Monarch.  This is an absolute must-see!",1203292800,3,437,4.64935064935065
1991576,5,B0001DMUEK,"The characters are so lovable, the scenery beautiful and the scripts very well written.  This series is able to  stir the entire range of emotions and is my new favorite series.",1198022400,3,177,4.67741935483871
1991577,5,B0001DMUEK,Great TV series ! It lets you appreciate the customs of Scotland not to mention the breathtaking views! Just awesome!,1195257600,3,117,4.9
1991578,5,B0001DMUEK,"This series is excellent with a strong cast of characters, each one very appealing, and with story lines that are intriguing. The scenery is spectacular and production value is very high. Beneath the twists and turns of various situations there are conflicts that present only difficult solutions due to hundreds of years of history within a country or a family, and lessons for viewers to ponder. I enjoyed each episode and wanted to continue watching to the end of the entire series.",1169856000,3,485,4.926829268292683
1991579,5,B0001DMUEK,"I was hooked on the first episode.  Fantastic scenery, great acting, and witty humor.  I have purchased all the series as they come available.",1168819200,2,142,4.875
1991580,5,B0001DMUEK,"This is a great series. The scenery is fantastic. If you have been to Scotland, think of the lands between Perth and Inverness. Tall mountains, deep lochs, lots of trees. The story always blends comedy and romance, with a wee dram of morals. The charecters are warm and friendly, all have a bit of baggage they carry, but who doesn't. Since this is no longer shown on PBS or BBC America, it's a must for your personal library",1168300800,3,425,4.461538461538462
1991581,5,B0001DMUEK,I have seen every episode right up till it ended. Makes you think that life in Scotland is like that and the sun always shines. I wish. I'll watch them all again and again,1153872000,2,171,4.0588235294117645
1991582,4,B0001DMUEK,"Quirky, friendly, intriguing and fun.  Except for season 2 which is unnecessary (boring) to the rest of the otherwise wonderful, colorful  and delightful series, the entire series is fun to watch.  The characters are memorable, the music is great, the scenery is unrivaled, and that castle!!  Wow!",1153180800,,297,5.25531914893617
1991583,5,B0001DMUEK,"I always thought British show is very boring but after watching Monarch of the Glen, it changed my thinking.... This show is great and funny! Furthermore, it has nice scenery as well.... I am always crazy about Highlands, etc ^_^ I will definitely go for Season 3, 4 and 5.....

Oh yeah, their British accent is ""cute""!",1152748800,2,319,4.5964912280701755
1991584,5,B0001DMUEK,"The stunning scenery of Scotland is reason enough to want this series. A young man has left his ancestral home and spent some years in London. When his father has a boating accident Archie is called home. The father recovers but informs his son that he is now the Laird. At first Archie can't wait to get back to the city, but he is continually drawn into the life on the estate, partly because of trying to help with major financial troubles. The actors in the film are all outstanding. I now own all the episodes and wish there were more.",1151280000,3,540,4.356435643564357
