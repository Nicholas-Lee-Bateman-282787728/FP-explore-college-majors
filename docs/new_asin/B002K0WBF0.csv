8371673,3,B002K0WBF0,I believe it is unrated for the shame of it.  Monica Gambee is gorgeous but displays little skin.  An accidental boob shot is pasted over with black tape.  Lots of blank spots for transitions.  Sort of like it has been clipped of all goodies.  Blood is pretty much gone.  Not the movie I remember.,1367539200,,297,4.407407407407407
8371674,3,B002K0WBF0,"Call Back (2009) is an independent production that actually does qualify as `torture porn', as it features some of both.  It is a tale of revenge that quickly takes a dark turn, and though the intensity wavers, the focus stays mostly on course.

Casting actresses for his new horror film, director Levi Rausch (Rob Benedict) is quite bored, listening to girl after girl pretend to scream for her life.  That is until he encounters Meadow (Monica Gambee), and asks her to drop by his home later that evening for a screen test.  After Meadow arrives, Levi begins to shoot her with his video camera while taking her on a tour of his home, and showing her some of the props used in his horror thriller called `Vice'.  It appears that Levi may be about to take advantage of the young actress, when he is suddenly ambushed and knocked out.

The director awakes lying face up on the floor, a prisoner of the torture device featured in his movie.  Each of his wrists is locked in a vise, that is bolted to a concrete block.  The weight is too heavy for him to get up from the floor.  Holding him prisoner are Meadow, and her lesbian lover Sonia (Chantelle Barry), who also auditioned for him earlier that day.  As she begins to torment and torture the helpless man, it becomes clear that Meadow's agenda includes making Rausch experience some of the same brutalities featured in his film.  Rausch's brain scrambles to figure a way out, but it seems there isn't one.

Sadistic females, and the uncertainly about what will happen, are the film's primary draw.  Sex is part of the equation, but it usually involves the ladies getting busy with each other, providing the opportunity to  cut away from Rausch lying on the floor.  Things get even darker, when the truth about the director is eventually revealed, as something that Rausch can't remember, is an event that Meadow can't forget.  Before they leave, the ladies do some heavy damage.

Behaving in an overly theatrical way, the characters are not very believable.  Rausch has a very low tolerance for pain.  He screams too much, whines like a child, and isn't very convincing when being tortured, or later when he attempts to escape, supposedly with two crushed wrists.  Sonja and Meadow carry on with a spirit of carefree glee, such as when they play a bloody game of tick-tack-toe, cutting into Rausch's belly.  While Call Back does entertain, it's a little too slick, with much that doesn't rings true.  If revenge and torture are of high interest, this might be worth a rental.  Rating of 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.",1308960000,,2566,4.678571428571429
8371675,2,B002K0WBF0,"Call Back is a movie that some might enjoy if you want to watch 90 minutes of girl on girl action, and some grit your teeth moments ,other than that it's a drawn out torture porn flick with most of the really disturbing torture done off camera and what they did show had little or no effects..yeah yeah they put a couple of rubber fingers in a blender,So what~!The acting is quite good I will give kudos where kudos are deserved.and the girls are sexy ""I'm a straight woman who loves slashers so that didn't sweeten the pot for me"".I see gore in other reviews?????? What gore? the bleeding finger? Yes, there were some very uncomfortable scenes that are wince worthy but no pay off.
I kept waiting for something really good to happen visually, but ,No it didn't. The premise was revenge driven and the writing had it's clever points such as the ending, it just didn't translate on film in a way that was satisfying. I usually watch all of these kind of movies but I found myself wanting to fast forward my DVD player to see if I could get to the steak instead of the spam..Alas,No steak to be had.",1273104000,2,1097,4.382352941176471
8371676,5,B002K0WBF0,"If you like ""revenge"" films, particularly those where the ladies turn the tables on the men, you won't want to miss ""Call Back"".  Starring the superb cast of Monica Gambee, Rob Benedict and Chantelle Barry, this nail-biter is not for the squeamish.  The box says it all: ""Lights...camera...torture.""  ""He called back.  They got parts.""",1271980800,,335,5.148148148148148
8371677,4,B002K0WBF0,"If you like hot women, comedy and gore then this movie is for you. Loosely contructed as a sequel to the indie great, ""swiming with sharks"", ""call back"" succeeds on its own terms. I wish I saw this in the theaters!

Warning: the blender scene might cause you to hurl. You've been warned.
