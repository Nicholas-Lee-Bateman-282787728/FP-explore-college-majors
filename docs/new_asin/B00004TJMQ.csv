7923041,2,B00004TJMQ,"This is great history and exceedingly well told -- but the program is a visual let-down.  This ""Blu-Ray"" disc is HD pretty much only when historians are being taped on visually boring indoor sets. But the video quality deteriorates abruptly to SD (and fairly lame SD at that) for outdoor shots of the world's great golf courses.  This discontinuity was made all-the-more jarring by the justaposition of alternating clips with widely varying image quality.  The distributers initially sent me their SD version in error (a mistake they quickly corrected) but I am not sure how much visually discernable difference there is between the SD and Blu-Ray versions.

A lot of people will buy this disc expecting to see the exqusite detail of lush fairways.  They will be disappointed by smudgy golf course footage which looks almost like VHS in places.  Couldn't the big-budget Golf Channel afford to shoot some true HD from scratch?  This apparent reliance on their older archival footage and or cheaper stock footage mars an otherwise great program.  I have been spoiled by true Blu-Ray products such as the visually breath-taking ""Visions of Britain and Ireland"" which are entirely high definition (and expensive to shoot from helicopters).  But ""The Story of Golf"" falls far short of that visual standard.  I can only imagine how exhillerating it might have been to have seen dazzling HD imagery shot from above gorgeous golf courses.

Amazon ought to require producers of ""Blu-Ray"" products to disclose on their packages the percentage of the program actually shot on some standardized definition of HD.  I would have returned this disc had the program itself not been so good.  It is well worth having but I would try to pick up the Blu-Ray version used if the sellers don't drop the price to a level which more accurately reflects the limited visual appeal of their product.",1294963200,,1873,4.983922829581994

He said the dvd is great, and provided him with all sorts of new, interesting information.",1197331200,2,260,4.285714285714286

the history of golf. My dad loved it!!",1168387200,3,95,4.277777777777778
7923044,5,B00004TJMQ,"First of all, let me tell you that this dvd is included if you buy the book : ""BOBBY JONES and the quest for the grand slam"" for free!!! the book itself is fantastik. I bought it here at amazon.

About the dvd , it is a tremendous journey trough the  HISTORY of GOLF, from the very beginnig to the present day, so everyone is present not only tiger woods.

It covers almost every aspect of the game : the backround, the equipment and the changes thru time, the improvments in the ball, the courses, rules, tournaments, the media (first the magazines, then the tv) influence, and of course THE PLAYERS; and believe me everyone is present.

 I recommend it higly.",1120262400,8,661,4.429752066115703
7923045,3,B00004TJMQ,"This video covers a wide scope for golf history. From how to make a feather golf ball to golf course. Golfers can make use of the contents to test other colleagues. One point to be criticized is that there is little to link with Tiger Woods (...) (actually it is Narr. by Jim Mckey). There is only one chapter mentioned Tiger but it also mentioned other great golfers, in similar manner. That's why one star has been eliminated. Dear Tiger fans, please note.",1004140800,6,458,4.530120481927711
