THE DARK HOUR is a mystery programmer directed by Charles Lamont (he also worked with Abbott & Costello, and did Ma & Pa Kettle and Francis the Talking Mule films).

The story follows a classic format: two detectives investigating the murder of an elderly millionaire are presented with a number of suspects, all of whom have motives for homicide. The movie also diverts from the familiar and expected: the two detectives, one old, one young, work independent of each other and cautiously compare notes. After a second killing occurs, the men decide to join forces to solve the case.
