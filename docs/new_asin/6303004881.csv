Just plain fun. Not on dvd as of this rating. Wished it was.",1177027200,8,123,4.545454545454546
532299,5,6303004881,"This is probably on of my top 10 movies.

I love how they use muscle cars and drag racing.

I don't see why they never made anymore movies like this one . Great combination of humor and muscle cars. The chevelle from the movie is awesome",1098662400,,237,4.130434782608695
532300,5,6303004881,THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE LIKE IT,1075507200,,57,3.4615384615384617
532301,4,6303004881,"Yup, this movie is the first to be written and directed by Stephen Sommers, famed writer/director of The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Deep Rising, and more. That alone should tell you what to expect, because Sommers' sense of humor is present throughout this film. Mind you, he filmed it entirely with independent funding and so you can pretty much expect minimal special effects (almost none, to be honest), but it's definitely fun to watch.
The story is a rather forumla plot, though with a few twists that make it at least a little different. Melissa Hanson (played by the talented but largely unsung Loryn Locklin) is trying to raise money to save her high school from being closed down by the school board but no one will help her. Dylan Malone (Matt Lattanzi) is a smart-but-poor high school student who earns money by drag-racing. Together, he and Melissa hatch a plot to save the school by racing for cash on the school's dime.
But you don't watch this movie for the plot alone. The sense of humor--which is pure camp, and hilarious for it--is what really makes this film. (Listen for the same kid shouting ""Knock it off, you butthead!"" at every new scene in the school, for example)
If you like Stephen Sommers, you may like this movie. Trust me. :)

532549,5,6303004881,"Catch Me If You Can, not to be mistaken by the Leonardo DiCaprio movie is one of my all time favorite films. It's not the highest quality or highest budget film, but it was very well produced to be entertaining. Being a car buff the movie appealed to me right away but it's got a nice story and great car racing scenes. I give this move a 10 out of 5 stars.",1365552000,2,357,3.9722222222222223

I love to watch it and see how a small time drag racer, with little money to have no money and win the his way to keep his school open and to also win a scholarship to go to college.  This action packed action movie is one of my favorite.  Many great actors play star in this movie, and dylan has the fastest car, but things get hectic when his car is destroyed.  Then when the fatman think he`s won, dylan, mellissa find fast freddy(Principal) has the 57 Chevy for the Twin city run, and time ticks as dylan beat the fatman.
