2193107,4,B0006SH25C,"First of all, I should say that the X Files is my favourite show, and I hold it with the high regard of being the finest television programme ever created. Although, I bought season's 1-7 seperately, and will not be purchasing 8 and 9 because in my eyes and many others, they are not really the X Files.

Anyway, aside from that, the special features really aren't as great as you keep saying. Yes, we get a 10 minute or so documentary, but 9 times out of 10, when they talk about some episodes from each season, they miss out talking about the best ones. Like, why was there no mention of how Quentin Tarantino was supposed to direct the final ever Glen Morgan and James Wong episode? In fact, there was no mention of the final Morgan and Wong episode at all. There are also no outtakes which would have been brilliant. No interviews with Duchovny or Anderson directly for the DVD's. Plus, the episodes are in broadcast order, which sometimes messes the plot up somewhat (But fortunately it tells you the right order on the box).

Anyway, all of that could be forgivable seeing as what you get with the special features are all excellent. However, why is it that season 6 has such lousy quality? Every episode looks like a video transfer, and a bad one at that. Duchovny's AMAZING episode in season 6, looks partially stretched from time to time. Apparently the sound isn't surround either, but I wouldn't know because I don't have a surround system.

Oh well, maybe I'm just complaining about the features because it's such a complicated show, with so many hidden links in minor episodes, that you want some extra info on the features.

But, saying all of that, it's still the greatest TV show of all time, and it will never be topped seeing as they covered so many interesting stories, that if anybody ever tried to do a mythology show again based on the unknown, they would immediately be compared to the X Files, and it would be so hard to find new ideas that it will probably never happen (Although I'd like to see it). And saying that, I would have bought seasons 1-7 even if they had no features, and the picture and sound were pretty lousy on all the episodes.

Hope I've been of some help. Happy shopping.",1119657600,8,2215,4.5
2193108,3,B0006SH25C,"For the price that they are asking for this set they should include a dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  I got Star Trek Voyager recently and that included a 5.1 soundtrack, heck even the original Star Trek series has a 5.1 soundtrack.  Until they either reduce the price by half or include that dolby 5.1 I will not pay for this DVD set.  Otherwise, this is probably my favorite TV series other than Voyager.",1111104000,8,397,4.486111111111111
2193109,5,B0006SH25C,"Before praising this series and set to the heavens, I want to begin with a complaint. Although this set comes with some of the finest special features I've ever seen with a box set (the set lacks only the X-FILES movie to be complete), it remains, like all of the individual seasons of THE X-FILES, hideously overpriced. The moralist in me reacts to the kind of gouging that takes place in sets like this. There is very little reason to price any single season of this or most other series any higher than around $60 list (so that discount outlets like Amazon would sell it for around $40), and for all nine seasons of THE X-FILES any price above around $360 discounted is completely unjustifiable, even with all the extras. I feel I ought to dock this set a star simply because of the outrageous pricing, but won't only because of my overall regard for the show. I consider the current discounted price of well over $600 to be a complete moral outrage. The content gets the five stars, not the pricing, which is simply atrocious.

On every level and by any standard, THE X-FILES was one of the truly great shows in television history. It is also remarkable for its extensive influence on other television shows. Its impact, in fact, on other shows has been profound. In part this has been by making fantasy-supernatural shows more acceptable, but in part by making the ""mythology"" shows with immersive, long story arcs popular. Without THE X-FILES and shows it influenced like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (many major members of THE X-FILES staff would later join Buffy's Joss Whedon on various shows, including David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, Howard Gordon, and Jeffrey Bell, all of whom played major roles on each show), the long story arc that plays such a central role in many of television's finest shows would probably not exist. THE X-FILES was the first non-detective show, non-soap on television to feature complex story arcs that extended over several seasons. The show made possible kinds of series that had been impossible before. Without THE X-FILES, it is hard to imagine such shows as BUFFY, ANGEL, FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DARK ANGEL, all of the later STAR TREK shows, FARSCAPE, SIX FEET UNDER, ALIAS, 24, DEAD LIKE ME, and LOST being given an opportunity (or not being given an opportunity in the cases of FIREFLY and WONDERFALLS) to thrive. Before THE X-FILES, the only acceptable format for genre shows was the stand alone episode. Plots had to be resolved each week. It had to be possible for first time viewers to immediately pick up on the central elements of any episode. And seasons had to be wrapped up neatly as the end of each year. THE X-FILES, on the other hand, while most of the episodes tended to be stand alones, featured a host of episodes that were part of a multi-season narrative. Many plot elements were left unresolved on various episodes. With the complexity of the long term story line it was often difficult for newcomers to get into the show. And every season of the show ended with a cliffhanger. Indeed, even the final episode, which was written knowing that it would be the last, was written with an open-endedness. It didn't close off the past so much as gesture towards the future (and for fans of the show, hopefully a series of feature films). Only recently I read an article on the demand for new ""X-FILE"" type shows in the wake of the unexpected success of ABC's LOST, a show that is a definite descendent of THE X-FILES.

It is almost impossible to enumerate all of the things that this show got right. To speak of the most immediately obvious, the casting was absolutely perfect. In the history of television, regardless of genre, it is impossible to come up with more than a very few duos as outstanding as David Duchovny as the ever credulous, passionately curious Special Agent Fox Mulder and Gillian Anderson as the detached, sceptical Special Agent Dana Scully. So vividly did they bring their characters to life that the expression ""to Scully"" someone has become part of the language (i.e., to doubt someone). Indeed, Mulder and Scully enter television's ranks of the greatest teams with such duos as Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton or Archie and Edith Bunker. Duchovny is not one of the great actors television has seen, but he brings a commitment to his role that made it work. He likewise has a fundamental likability and a gift for comedy that helped the show, especially beginning in Season Three, swing effortlessly between truly scary episodes to delightfully funny ones. His good looks didn't hurt either. Unlike Duchovny, Gillian Anderson is an extremely capable actress, capable of convincingly evincing nearly any mood asked of her. Indeed, she is so superb as an actress that many of the finest episodes of the nine seasons focused almost entirely on her character, whether in a Christmas episode where she shockingly learns that despite being barren (because of a Season One abduction), a young girl is apparently her genetic offspring, or in a Season Seven masterpiece where she encounters a man she had had a passionate relationship with years earlier, causing her to reevaluate whether the decision she had made to become an FBI agent rather than a doctor had been the right one. In fact, the more she is pushed in the show, the more her skills as an actress become evident. She is also one of the most delightfully short actresses to head a TV show, and one of the joys of the show is to watch the ongoing struggle of wardrobe and make up to high her shortness, watching them play with various coats and outerwear, spotting the occasional huge heels that poke from underneath her carefully hemmed pants, or reading about the boxes that she would sometimes stand on to keep her in the frame with Mulder. Her height is improbably listed as either 5'2 or 5'3 on websites, but clearly at least two or three inches below that.

But the marvelous cast didn't end with Mulder and Scully. Mitch Pileggi played Assistant Director Walter Skinner for most of the show's run, initially as a stubborn sceptic and mild antagonist, but in the end a true friend, ally, and true believer in all of the conspiracies that Mulder insisted existed. Tom Braidwood (who was also one of the show's assistant directors), Bruce Harwood, and Dean Haglund teamed to form The Lone Gunmen, who proved so popular as supporting characters that they briefly got their own spin off series. When Duchovny more or less after Season Seven, he was replaced by the unexpectedly magnificent Robert Patrick as Agent Doggett, and when he needed a new partner in the final season, Anabeth Gish stepped in as Agent Monica Reyes. There were a host of other recurring characters, none more crucial to the show's success-especially in the mythology episodes-than William B. Davis's extraordinary character The Cigarette Smoking Man. The CSM became synonymous with conspiracy in its worst possible forms.

I wish I had space to extol the virtues of the writers. Unless one has watched the show all the way through, one cannot possibly imagine the spectacular consistency of the writers, or the overall excellence of the writing for the show. Time and again they attempted to stretch the show to new limits, to try new kinds of episodes. Beginning in Season Three they even started writing comic scripts, and I have to confess to being on the fence as to whether I prefer the serious or comic episodes. The extreme virtuosity of the writers is obvious from beginning to end. Then there was Mark Snow, who with his synthesizer managed to produce absolutely perfect scores for the series from its inception until its end, including that eerie but incredibly appropriate theme. Although the crew as a whole was largely anonymous, the show possessed one of the most unique looks in TV history. Whether special effects or make up or set design, the show stands out from almost every other show.

THE X-FILES greatest legacy is probably going to be the way it has made possible enormously complex story lines. We have already seen this influence in the shows I mentioned above, but I think the effect is going to ripple down through all of what we see in TV in the future. If THE X-FILES had been merely a critical success, it would not have had this influence, but the fact that it managed for most of its run very high ratings showed TV execs that it was possible to have both a very complex story line and high ratings. Unfortunately, there was a lull in this attitude during the lamentable rise of the reality show, but with the unexpected success of LOST, the prognosis for the complex mythology show is once again quite high. Paradoxically, my only complaint with THE X-FILES is that it wasn't terribly consistent in its mythology. Chris Carter by his own admission acknowledges (in DVD add ons and elsewhere) that they were more or less making up the storyline as they went along. It sometimes shows. Many of the shifts in the mythology storyline fail to mesh well with the rest of the mythology. Parts contradict other parts. Until we got the series finale in the Ninth Season, for instance, it wasn't at all clear what happened to Mulder's sister or what his precise biological relation to The Cigarette Smoking Man was. Even at the very end, although they were clearly a deeply committed romantic couple, it wasn't clear that Mulder and Scully had ever slept together (despite her having had a child by him, but that it another complex issue). In other words, there is vagueness at many points in the show that was superficially cleared up in the finale.

By any conceivable standard, this is one of the truly great shows in the history of television. But it is more than that. I am not much of a fan of television. I rarely find more than one or two shows to watch during the typical television season (I currently watch only LOST and ALIAS and 24), but I do believe, unlike many of an intellectual bent, that television actually possesses an inherent superiority over film. Series simply have more time than a movie does. If handled properly, this allows for a degree of narrative exposition that is absolutely impossible for any movie to match. Very few television series have managed this. THE X-FILES is one of the few exceptions.",1109894400,201,10254,4.764341957255343

2193116,5,B0006SH25C,"I've purchased this UK edition from a third-party seller, STMedia. It comes in a nice sturdy box made of high-quality material. It contains all of the individual seasons on Blu-ray which you can purchase separately but I would recommend getting this box set so you can have them all in one box set (there is even an empty space allocated for the Event Series/Season 10). Some complain that this is not truly a ""collector's set"" but if you are simply looking to upgrade your old DVDs, this is really an amazing upgrade. Blu-ray quality is simply fascinating. There are no artifacts on any of the episodes. HD video and audio quality are crystal clear. They did a superb job with the Blu-ray transfer. Some episodes are grainy and dark but that's because they were filmed that way, so that has nothing to do with the transfer. I owned all of the individual seasons on DVD and I was simply looking to upgrade my old DVDs. This did the job perfectly. I've read some complaints about the changing of the format and some special effects being reproduced for the Blu-ray versions. Frankly, it had been a long time since I watched the episodes and I cannot tell what's different about these versions. I'd probably have to watch the old DVDs and these Blu-ray versions side by side or back to back in order to be able to tell the difference. Unless you are picky about the original format and the original special effects and can tell the difference, these versions will serve perfectly fine.

My only complaint, if I have to have one, would be the difficulty in closing the each case. They are nice thick cases that hold multiple discs but once you open them, they are not easy to close unless you make sure the edges of the case are properly aligned. It is a bit of a hassle. Other than that, I have no other complaints.

X-Files is probably the only TV show that I was ever hooked on. I don't even watch TV. But aside from the cleverly written episodes about the supernatural and paranormal and the alien conspiracy mythology, I think the reason why this show was magically successful was the chemistry between Agent and Scully, brilliantly portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, respectively. Their devotion to their work, their dedication to finding the truth, their professionalism and their trust for each other in a world where ""no one to be trusted"" is what made this show phenomenal. The X-Files will always be very special to me, the same way The Twlight Zone (the original TV series) and Star Trek (the original TV series) were special. I cannot think of a lot of shows which I regard as highly as I regard these shows.",1515801600,2,2633,4.611940298507463

The navigation on the DVDs is beyond frustrating. You choose between light grey and white to highlight episode name, play, or play all. Its hard to figure out what epIsolde is highlighted.

We did a home improvement project and cut flimsy dvd sleeve in half to be able to see episodes without having to remove it each time.

Subtitles: English, French, Spanish
However, after I received my package and checked the product details listed behind every blu ray, I noticed it says that it only comes with subtitles in English.

2193191,3,B0006SH25C,"What this product IS: Blu-ray discs of The X-Files, Seasons 1-10 w/ special features, and a slip case containing an additional place for the 2-disc Blu-ray edition of the movies
What this product IS NOT: Worthy of the title ""Collector's Set""

Here's why:

First and foremost, the package itself arrived in great condition. The product inside? Not so much. Even through the plastic wrap, all of the corners have scuff marks and signs of poor handling.

Second; Once you actually get everything open, you realize that the box is just filled with discs that were intended for individual sale. Yes - these are the exact same as if you just bought all of the Blu-rays individually by season. There is no difference. The most annoying part of the process was having to remove the white sticker label from the top of Every. Single. Case. Again, back to the individual sale thing.

Third; Four of the ten cases ended up breaking in some way, with every single one showing some signs of cosmetic wear; whether it was pieces from the inside that broke off and were rattling inside with the discs, or pieces that were somehow shaved off the outside of the case. There's not a single case that's in mint condition, which is ludicrous.

Fourth; The placeholder they include (where you can put the 2-disc movie Blu-ray case) is freaking GLUED IN. Why?? I literally had to rip off part of the inside of the box to remove it. Whose genius idea was that?

So, all that said, is it worth it? Even after all of my complaints (which may or may not be a deal breaker for some), I still say yes. Why? Well, the price makes it a good deal even with all of the cosmetic flaws that should not come with a brand new product. I got this for $128 ($108, after using a gift card). If these discs were somehow slightly different from the individual ones, and were in brand new condition, this would be an absolute steal. But, as it is, you get the entire series with special features for about $12-13/season. And, from what I've seen, the actual quality of the episodes is excellent, and honestly that's what really matters here.

2193208,4,B0006SH25C,"First things first: MULTI FORMAT DOES NOT INCLUDE DVDs!!!  Yes I foolishly bought this hoping it would have DVDs in it, but it turns out it's ridiculously hard to buy all 9 original seasons on DVD, and it would be more expensive (even buying used) than just getting this.  I bought a blu-ray player just for this boxset.  When I opened the Amazon box and saw this beauty I wanted to cry.  It's a great looking box and the disks have awesome artwork on them and there's a (blu-ray sized) space for season 10 and it's so pristine and shiny and smooth.  This is a must have for the paranoid X-Files fan scared of Netflix removing the series forever.
The disks themselves are nicely labeled, but I was upset at the lack of paper materials inside of each disk container.  The list of episodes is behind the first disc on the reverse of the case jacket, and has no episode descriptions for when you can't quite remember an obscure title.  After putting in the disc, one might be discouraged about the quality of the blu-ray, but you have to have reasonable expectations when working with a series from the mid-90s and on.  Yes the title sequence is still grainy.  It will always be that way.  The disc menu was basic, a little hard to see which option is highlighted for selection, but the basics are all there.  You can select to play all of the episodes on the disc straight through without returning to the menu, and the special features are quite amusing.  Some blew my mind and others (like the foreign clips) were simply cute little things.

All in all, a must have, but limit your expectations.  Beautiful, modern packaging, but the same old X-Files we all love inside.
(Also, I can't tell the difference between the Multi-Format and regular blu-ray package.  Go for whichever is cheapest!)",1484006400,7,1791,4.588050314465409
2193209,5,B0006SH25C,"If you're an X-Files enthusiast, you can't go wrong with this Blu-Ray collection. Every single episode, including last year's event series, is included, along with an invasion of behind-the-scenes materials and commentaries. Nearly all of it is meticulously remastered to a starting degree - you've never seen it this sharp.

Now I did say ""nearly."" There are one or two caveats to the update that you should be aware of. First, the block lettering of the credits didn't benefit from being cleaned up - in fact, they look downright ugly at times. Second, scenes involving special effects are still rather rough, probably because cleaning them up would have made them stand out even more. But these are minor quibbles in what should probably be the definitive X-Files collection (well, until another season gets made, anyway).",1483833600,,825,5.111111111111111

I wish there were more episodes per disc because I'm lazy, and the show is on Netflix which doesn't require me getting up. The reason I got the set was for the bonus features, and they're a little abyssmal. No bloopers, even?! Ugh. But, for quality and collectivity, this boxset is top notch.

Also the new season has special features about the comeback of the series and the cast and crew reactions to coming back after so many years apart.

As an avid X-Files fan I welcomed finally seeing the re-mastered episodes on Netflix. I remember saying to my wife during EVERY episode we watched together, that it was like watching the episode for the first time because the detail was so superior to the DVD box set.

I have made this purchase today because not only is it a steal at $122.99, but it isn't going to be on Netflix forever. It is a small price to pay for the greatest TV show ever made, on bluray.",1468972800,7,908,5.04

2193274,5,B0006SH25C,"It maybe a re-release, but I really like that they're releasing some of this stuff on blu-ray. It looks a ton better than any release before!

Yes, the first few seasons are framed slightly tight as they've been converted from 4:3 to 16:9, but this is NOT a Buffy disaster! It's been said that they had widescreen planned from the beginning so room was left on the negatives for widescreen (if I'm not using the right terms, sorry!). Really, I think it looks great widescreen.

Also, there rarely is a scene where it's unconverted from the DVD release because the original film was lost or bad or something. It's an obvious drop in quality when that happens, but it's the best they had. They also redid the special effects because the originals were not HD. For the most part they look good but they leave a little less to the imagination than lower resolution effects so there's more uncanny valley going on. I think it's as good as the other shows they redid effects for like Star Trek.

They also redid the fonts for any onscreen text, and I wish they had matched them better. You can see the changes on the main title, actor mentions at the beginning of the episode, and when they show a place name on screen. I think the new text font looks slightly less X-Files--maybe slightly less spooky and a bit more generic? It's not a big deal, but I wish they would have put a bit more care in that.

As far as the deal of the Day for $130, it's a good deal for both. This is just the bundle of the complete series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files-Complete-Seasons-1-9-Blu-ray/dp/B01729J1O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X Files: Complete Seasons 1-9 [Blu-ray</a>] and the new season ""The Event"":&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Files-The-Event-Series-2016-Blu-ray/dp/B01BX7WUCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Files: The Event Series (2016) [Blu-ray</a>]. So you're saving about $60 off the current price (online it says for one day in January that the 1-9 complete box dropped to $130, but that was without ""The Event""). If this is like other Amazon bundles, you're getting the exact same thing as if  you bought them separate. Same extras, same lack of digital, same packaging. While the new season won't come inside the collector's set, there is a space in the collector's set box for the new ""The Event"" season. The movies are not in this collection.

The disk packaging is great. The collection has each season in separate blu-ray style plastic cases. There's none of that cardboard disk-holder junk here. I'm very happy with how the disks are packaged and the collectors box is ok too.

If you love X-Files and want everything hi-def, this is a great box set. Yes, you can watch the same upgrade on Netflix, but the blu-ray looks even better than streaming. I've not watched most of this since the original run so it's been fun to re-watch this.",1468972800,57,2947,5.089026915113871

Everything else is a big let down.  The font issue with the logo in the open is really inexcusable, how a company can mess up the logo for a show is unbelievable, it's not even close.  I have to compare these to my original dvd set with it's wonderful packaging and simple menus.  This Blu-ray set comes in a simple box with each season the new standard box set plastic cases, one per season.  The discs don't have the episode names on them and the only listing is underneath the first disk.  The menus are tiny text in white, medium gray, light gray, and black over gray very hard to read and require you to scroll to see the episode then often click down to play.

Also, they throw big plain stickers over the barcodes for the individual seasons that cover up some of the descriptions as opposed to printing new sleeves that are blank.  So these are literally the individual seasons that they cut the plastic off of and covered the barcodes with big white stickers and put them in a single box.

I was consumed with my job with a lot of overtime including weekends.  I missed out while the series was active all those years ago.  Recently, when the X-Files mini-series was released, I watched all six episodes.  This unleashed an insatiable appetite for MORE! :-)

I went online and discovered that the entire X-Files collection were available and in stunning HD!  OMG! I had to have it and so I ordered it.  I was blown away by the suspense and awe that each episode delivers.  The actors, storyline, the ambient music and sounds are phenomenal.  Chris Carter is a true master and craftsman to have the ability to deliver this epic series!  Hats off and a THOUSAND cheers for this monumental series.  I love the X-Files and I can now say I'm truly a devoted fan.

I'm on episode two now and if you've never seen this series before, it must be watched from the beginning as later episodes make reference to past episodes.

I'm so happy that the mini-series came out so that I'm now able to enjoy this epic series that I missed all those years ago.  I hope that more X-files seasons are created in 2016.  I'll be first in line to order future episodes!",1458086400,3,1363,4.449392712550607

2193346,4,B0006SH25C,"First as others have pointed out this is just the single seasons in a fancy box. I was lucky to purchase as a deal of the day item, which meant I got a worth wild price break. Had that not happened I would have been greatly disappointed in the price for the product. I do wish that in addition to un-wrapping the individual seasons (all have some wrapper on the spine and one still had a portion attached to the bottom) the stickers were removed from the top too.

The episodes them selves are amazing. I have been lucky to watch them on a new Samsung Series 8 TV and it is just wow. The conversion is great and the TV's upscaling is even better. I would never be able to say enough about how great the picture is. My buddy, who is a bigger X-files fan than I am has been over and watched several episodes with me and has agreed about the stunning quality. If you watch the extras, which are on a meh level, they are not converted and really show the difference.

Now one down side to me is the menus. It is hard to tell between the dark gray and the light black, which is the selected color. The play single episode or play all can be confusing until you realized the default is play all and you have hit up for the single episode selection, again what causes this is the lack of color difference. I know they were going with a theme but really having to guess and check what option you're on is a pain, or guess if you are about to play an episode or change the subtitles.

All in all this is an amazing set to own, and any fan needs, weather the collection or the individual season. Do your self a favor and check which is cheaper at the time of purchase. For the quality of the episodes you will not regret it.",1455408000,,1714,4.125748502994012
2193347,3,B0006SH25C,"As a long time X-Files fan I've been waiting forever for the series to finally get an proper HD Version. Watching the original 4 seasons on Standard Def DVDs was painful. The picture quality was frankly, terrible. However, as someone who owned the entire series on DVD and then purchased it on multiple Digital Platforms I was determined not to go to the well again, especially when Netflix is streaming the HD Version and the cost of the set was ridiculous expensive - $400. So when it was on sale for $120, I couldn't help myself. Was so excited to receive this and then the disappointment set in.

The audio and video quality of the HD Transfer is top notch. There are zero complaints in that department. My issue is how lazy this release is. Especially at the ridiculously expensive retail price.  The packaging is terrible, it contains all 9 seasons in separate season jewel cases, and the boxes aren't labelled at the top so when you are looking at it from top down, you don't know which case goes to which season - granted if you are organized you'll probably just keep the cases in order, but still it just seemed like no thought went into the packaging beyond the beautiful outside art work.

Considering how long fans have waited for a Blu-ray release, this has almost zero original extras. All of the featurettes are from the original DVD releases from 10 years ago with no picture or audio updates. The picture quality on these are terrible, there is a lot picture fuzz around the edges and the audio quality seems to be in stereo.  And there's no digital copy, which frankly annoys the crap out of me. It just seems cheap when studios don't include digital copy codes in Box Sets or ""Collectors"" editions and way to milk more money out of people.

I don't expect Fox to release another upgraded edition of this anytime soon and that's a shame because fans deserved better than what we got.",1455321600,6,1902,4.58235294117647
2193348,4,B0006SH25C,"Received this box set on February 9th after ordering it on January 25th as part of amazon's 'Deal of the Day' priced at $129.99.

My thoughts:

At $129.99, each season costs $14.44, each disc costs $2.36.

The original DVD box set, 'The Complete Collector's Edition', which I also own, came with a sliding drawer that contained a decent enough episode guide, nine episode cards (mine were noted as 'pilot', 'deep throat', 'conduit', 'ice', 'fallen angel', 'eve', 'Beyond the Sea', 'Darkness Falls', 'Tooms' and, 'The Erlenmeyer Flask'), a $5 coupon redeemable for X-Files graphic novels at checker book publishing (probably expired at this point, no expiration date noted), issue 13 of an X Files graphic novel, and, 'The X-Files Fight The Future' movie poster. None of these items come with the new blu-ray set.

The packaging is flimsier than the DVD set and contains a removable black box (behind season 9) for the insertion of season 10 into the box. Also, a second black box sits behind the removable one and that one is glued tight to the box, so, removal is not recommended. For me, the inside cardboard piece glued to the top of the box came apart a bit when I slid out the drawer containing the blu-ray sets. So, lesson learned, be careful when sliding out the drawer.

I watched the first two episodes of Season 1 and am very impressed. Video and audio are exemplary. I, also, listened to Chris Carter's commentary in episode two and note that it also had good clarity and presence. I should note that it appears to me that all of the extras associated with the previous DVD release are here.

I, also, watched some of Season 8. It appears that I have the incorrect Season 8 (I checked the product number on the back of the disc as well as read up on this problem on several web sites). The kicker is, for me, this Season 8 is not that bad. Is it me? Maybe. Is it my system? Maybe (Panasonic plasma TV). So, I'll do a little more reviewing of Season 8 before I commit to contacting Fox and making the exchange. In the past, I have made exchanges successfully for discs that had problems, so, if you feel strongly about this issue, I suggest you follow through and get replacements.

All in all, I am very satisfied (it must be dinged at least one star) and can't wait to watch the entire thing again (oh, dear). The whole reason for buying these is the vast improvement in the video and audio. I can take the blu-ray season sets out of the box and place them on my shelves, preserve the box elsewhere. I plan on keeping the DVD set; it would be difficult to sell if I keep the extras that came with it. So, I highly recommend this set purchased as is, or, as separate season sets depending on the price. To be honest, after all this, separate season sets might just be the way to go. According to what I have read, Season 8 is being dealt with and the replacements may appear as part of any retail set beginning in March, and, maybe the price will be even less by then. Keep an eye out for sales, etc.",1455148800,,3011,4.443840579710145
2193349,5,B0006SH25C,"FOX did an awesome job with this! I am an old school X-File fan from back in the day, and I had all of the seasons on VHS. With this new revival in 2016, I felt it was finally time to upgrade my collection into the 21st century. What an amazing difference! Even the oldest episodes are crystal clear, and truly widescreen, which I think is new for the earlier seasons. On the techie side, these are scanned at 24MBps AVC.

I have not tried it on my surround sound yet, but on my headphones you can hear every detail crystal clear. I highly recommend this to any X-Files fan. You will not be disappointed.

The first, ""Fight the Future"", should be watched after season 5 and before season 6. The second, ""I Want To Believe"", should be watched after season 9 and before the new season 10.

You get nothing extra in this box set besides the cardboard box. The individual seasons are packaged just the same as if you were to buy them separately, and it might actually be cheaper to do that depending on the current price of this complete set.

The results of the HD restoration are a mixed bag. In general, the new scans from the original film stock look amazing, but FOX didn't want to pay for the visual effects to be redone in HD (understandable, as this would have cost a fortune). So, the shots with effects in the early seasons are up-rezzed from the original standard def footage, so sometimes the contrast between the shots is jarring. I wish the first few seasons had been preserved in their intended 4:3 aspect ratio, but I guess I have the original DVDs if I want to watch that.

The title sequence was redone poorly, with the wrong font used that will irk fans. This was very lazy, as they could easily have found the original font with a little effort.

2193373,4,B0006SH25C,"'The X-Files' happens to be an obsession of mine, so this glorious set was a must have for me! I have owned the original DVD set for not even a year, yet I decided to purchase the Blu-ray upgrade without hesitation (and may I say it was well worth the money!). The picture is stunning and the sound is superb!
I just received this in the mail yesterday, so I didn't yet go through the bonus features spread throughout each disc. I have only viewed a few of my X-Files favorites throughout each disc. What I can say is that visually the HD transfers are amazing. The boxset as a whole is beautifully done (the artwork and all) and many will notice a cardboard place holder for the upcoming 2016 season. Upon opening the box I was pleasantly surprised when I saw TWO place holders. I was hoping I'd be able to purchase the X-Files Movie set combo (which unfortunately wasn't included -- I knew about this prior to purchasing the set. It's certainly dumb not the include them, considering 'Fight The Future' is important when transitioning from season 5 to season 6.)... but the cardboard place holder is GLUED IN. Such a disappointment.

Speaking of glue. On the  boxset a description (on glossy paper) of the set was glued right to the back. I wish that it was just printed on the box itself. I don't intend on removing it.

Another disappointment of mine was the fact that it's pretty hard to navigate through the main title menu on each disc. I haven't tried watching this on a traditional Blu-Ray player. My navigation trouble could possibly be because I'm viewing it on my Xbox One, but I'm just sharing that I certainly had trouble with it and wish it was designed differently.

Although the set has faults, the stunning quality and bonus features (that I can't wait to go through!) certainly makes up for them!

I suggest you should buy this over the DVD version. It's a can't miss! Perhaps waiting for the price to go down would be more ideal but I just couldn't wait!! Overall I give this set a 4/5 stars.",1452902400,23,2012,4.501369863013698
2193374,5,B0006SH25C,"There's new (little) stuff to me from the soon to be obselete box set from fox. I own the collector's dvd box set release in 2007. It includes the first movie(dts sound-truth behind the movie(26:50)-commentary(C.C-R.B) and 3 trailers) and a dvd threads of mythology(there's four of them,short of a half hour).The threads are include on blu-ray,but not the movies,they exist on blu-ray but they are rare and costly(and don't know if there's more bonus than dvd),wait for a re-re-release. I bought the br at 14,99$can 55% of the basic price(bought 2 get one free),it's likely it will drop to 60-70%-10$ a season be patient. About the framing and sound i expected no miracle of something shot for tv in the 90's,it looks good(better than the br jacket,the actors look creepy)and it's loud. I just watch the first disc and the last one season 9. I suppose the deleted scenes,documentary and promo are all the same. The main new stuff is 10 new intros,They don't say much in 30 sec and 1min30 to resume the pilot and the series for people who know about the series it's kind of useless(i don't know yet when it was record,2005 or 2015).The really main new stuff is the 17 new commentary tracks,i listen the first one and sound like it was record in 2005. Does it mean the blu ray where ready since 10 years and they sit on it?? or they wanted to release the series br with the second movie??And the last new bonus is the wondercon 2008(26:48),it's the panel they went to talk about the second movie,We had seen bits of it on the bonus features of movie 2,it's the only new thing on the bonus disc,they could had full a disk with panel,why just that one,did like star wars and put the wink at the show(the simpsons parody).The dvd's had a menu for each show and no play all. The blu-ray got the play all option,the scene selection are call timelines you can skip every minutes of a show. The english subtitles are distracting,they are talking too much or the writer can't keep up or something they don't fit. The discs resume playback. 2 down 53 to go. Can't wait for season 10 or 7b.

10 feb---I'm now in season 5-half done. Starting season 4 the mixing is better,i suppose they had 5.1 in mind at the broadcast of the show. The commentaries were done 2005(the ones with Carter for sure).The introductions after the first 2 on disc 1 are missing or well hidden(weird).The level of dark are getting high,can't watch it in a well light place can't see anything(like the dvd's).Like criterion(grey on white) the menu can be hard to know on what your selecting(black on grey).I wrote 7b because people said it was a reboot but it ain't it's in continuity with season 9.",1452297600,,2660,4.588235294117647

2193381,5,B0006SH25C,"""The X-Files"" is a science fiction horror drama that ran for nine seasons from 1993-2002. The two principle characters are Fox Mulder(David Duchovny) and Dana Scully(Gillian Anderson) who are FBI agents who specialize in investigating paranormal phenomena.
The blu-rays looks great and appear to have been remastered and cleaned up. All of the seasons are now in anamorphic widescreen whereas on the DVDs the first four seasons were only in full screen. I checked one frame of the episode of ""Ascension"" just to see how the image looked on the blu-ray in comparison to the DVD, and there is much more image on both sides such that it now fills the screen. So there is actually more of the original image showing from the original master negative, as opposed to the image simply being stretched to fill the screen. There was also a bit more on the top, but a bit less on the bottom of the image of the blu-ray compared to the DVD's full frame image (which showed black bars on the sides of a flat screen TV). The sound is also in 5.1 HD Master Audio surround sound as opposed to 2.0 on the DVDs. Some of the images occasionally appear to have been shot in a lower resolution, or are slightly out of focus, so they look a bit grainy, though in most cases the images look pristine in 1080p with much more clarity overall. And it appears that most of the special features from the Collector's Edition sets have been included. All in all these episodes look great and fresh.

Perhaps the only real negative is that this box set has nothing extra compared to buying the individual seasons separately on blu-ray except for the box itself which actually costs more at this time than buying the individual seasons. And maybe it also would have been nice to have had the episodes labeled on the discs like my DVDs are, instead of on the inside front cover as seen through the blu-ray holder, or to have had a episode card included. All in all though these episodes look great. Watching the episodes in high definition everything looks so clear, and the images are now stable, whereas the DVDs showed jaggies and other anomalies.

The mixture of sic-fi, horror, myth, and mystery really grabbed my attention, and I was a fan until the end of this groundbreaking series.  If you are a fan of the original broadcast of this series, you may be thinking that the transfer to widescreen format from the original full screen may be a problem.  I was quite amazed at how crisp and clear the new widescreen transfers are with lots of detail and bright colors.  While I have not watched the entire set on Blu ray, what I have seen is truly amazing.  I really wasn't expecting to see the detail and crispness of the image.  The sound is also a huge improvement over the DVD counterpoint.  With all of the extras from the previous editions present here, this is a no brainer for any true fan of the series.  You are not likely to ever see or hear this series in better quality than this blu ray edition.",1449619200,7,935,4.2727272727272725
2193385,4,B0006SH25C,"Let me give you guys the real deal.

This is the best release to date of one of the best TV series of all time.  The episodes have been re-scanned in HD from the original film sources and the results are mostly amazing.  Episodes from the early seasons are especially stunning.  The difference between this set and any of the earlier DVD releases is night and day.  If picture quality is your primary concern, and you have an interest in owning all nine seasons of the show, stop reading now and buy this set (or wait for it to go on sale, then buy this set).

If you care about the presentation of the physical box set or the creative/historical integrity of the new HD transfer, things get more complicated.

While the episodes have been scanned from film sources, the CGI effects in many episodes were originally made on video meaning no high-resolution master exists of some effects shots.  To bring these shots into the HD era, the team behind this box set had to re-create them.  I don't know what methods were used but the results are mostly good however, they're not identical to the original shots and you can tell in a side-by-side comparison.  Sometimes they look too neat or crisp, but that might just be because we're used to seeing them in low-resolution on fuzzy formats... which were fitting for mysterious images of the unidentified and unexplained.  Long-time fans will immediately notice that the on-screen text titles look vaguely different as well, for the same reasons.  Even the main ""The X-Files"" title at the beginning of each episode has been redone, and to my eyes doesn't look as mysterious as it used to.  These changes just remind us from time to time that we're watching a new interpretation rather than the same show we watched in the 90s, and it feels a little funny.

Another significant change is the first four seasons are now in a 16:9 format to fill your HDTV, possible because the original film was shot with consideration for an eventual 16:9 release.  However, this doesn't necessarily mean these earlier seasons were *intended* to be seen in 16:9. Cinematography purists will balk at the empty space around the edges of some shots, particularly on the left side of the screen.  Reframing is also an issue some vertical space has been lost (along with details that were originally onscreen) in favor of expanded horizontal space (and details that were previously offscreen).

These issues mean this set is completely unacceptable as a *preservation* of the series as it originally aired.  Is it improved?  Possibly.  But is it a true restoration of the source material?  No.  That may never be possible given the limitations of the original computer effects, but it would have been nice to at least have the option of buying new HD transfers of early seasons in their original 4:3 framing.

The box set itself is adequate but not a five-star effort.  You get all nine seasons the same as they would be if you bought them individually, plus an attractive box to hold them in.

The presentation of the discs is pretty lazy.  Each disc is labeled generically with a season and disc number.  To see which episodes are on each disc, you need to remove the first disc from the case and peer at an index printed on the inside of the case's paper cover art.  The Blu-Ray menus are similarly bare-bones.  This presentation isn't worse than many other series sets on the market, but it is a clear step down from the early DVD releases of The X-Files, which were absolute works of art, especially the original ""collector's editions.""

Warts and all, this is probably a must-have for enthusiastic X-Files fans or people getting into the series for the first time (as long as they don't forget the movies, which are oddly not included in this set).  Fans who are in no particular hurry to revisit the series might be better off waiting for a more later edition that might include the 2016 ""event series,"" a more satisfying approach to the disc and menu presentation, and maybe even a preservation of the early seasons in a 4:3 ratio.",1449619200,252,4061,4.701555869872702
2193386,4,B0006SH25C,"This X-Files collector's set is nothing more than the X-Files Blu-rays for each of the seasons placed inside a cardboard box. There is no special book or even an insert listing all of the episodes. You are left with the episode index for each season, which is printed on the back of the paper liner for the season, meaning it is hard to read the print because it is covered by the inside of the plastic case. The box contains a removable cardboard filler, which can be replaced with a Blu-ray case. Apparently this is for you to place the Blu-ray of the upcoming six-episode Fox X-Files revival. There is also an attached cardboard filler, which can probably be removed without damaging the box. That space could be filled with a Blu-ray size case containing the two X-Files movies, which are not included in the collector's set. When compared to other complete series collections like Smallville, this is certainly less than I X-pected. Unless you are getting this set at a bargain price, there is no reason to pay $299 when you can purchase all seasons separately for much less. I lucked out by getting my box for $149 through Fox Connect during a brief sale. The last time I checked, the price was back to $299.",1449619200,10,1214,4.599078341013825
2193387,4,B0006SH25C,"Let me be clear, I love the show and Fox did a good thing by putting this together for fans. Why it took so long, I'm not sure but the wait WAS worth it.

Now, the box, what's so special about it compared to buying these individually? Nothing. It's just a big box. It's a handsome looking box  and there is a slot for the mini-series but no room for the two movies.

The series? It's all here. While the great stuff was really great but the bad, well, it was pretty bad. That's the good thing about a series though, you know, having seen the series which ones are great and which ones not so much. There's more great than bad and plenty of good, too.

Fyi, the Japanese got the series, a I Want To Believe poster, three special cards with commissioned artwork, an episode guide (well, it is in Japanese. We do get it on the inside of each season on the inside of the slip sheet.

I'm not sure why this doesn't have spots to put the two movies in the set (ok, in my universe there was only ONE movie)

So other folks here have covered the content. I'm going to,focus on how this looks.

First the set is presented in a Amray Blu-Ray cases. Most of them are the same size but given that the second season had the most episodes of any season, it is slightly bigger than the others. No room for the movies.

It looks exceptional. There are some visual effects shots and stock footage that was upscaled. Is that a problem? Well it doesn't look wuite as good as the rest of the show but it's not a huge drop in quality. Since ""The X-Files"" tried to use practical effects where possible for many scenes. Some visual effects shots were recomposited for HD transfers it all depended on how the effects were crested, if the original raw footage was available.

Please note that some folks have reported problems with black crush (which is usually associated with either sloppy transfer, encoding or both. Since season 8 is my least favorite season, I hadn't watched that set until today and, yep, it is a problem but as far as I can tell, it's the only season with this problem.

For purists looking for the seasons presented in 4:3, you will be disappointed. As was evident when presented on Netflix and the reports from sites like the digital bits, these hsve been reframed from the camera negative. What does that mean? There's always side area outside of the frame as originally presented and the director of photography masks that area off or it is masked off during the transfer (or both). However, to use that extra width, they had to sacrifice some head room or I formstion at the bottom of the frame. That's been done here is tasteful but it isn't as originally presented so purists will have to keep those DVD sets for that reason. The trade off is that the HD is stunning looking.

As mentioned, the visual effects were often created in SD and transferred from video. They have upscaled those here and they do suffer from edge enhancement among other flaws that exist with sharpening the image however, they are brief as many times the team would use practical effects unless it wasn't practical or too expensive to do that way based on their budget.,some shots were recreated in the HD realm where possible.

So why not present those years in originally seen 4:3 in that aspect ratio? Frankly, the Industry has the perception (based on market research) that these shows are perceived as ""old"" (much how black and white movies and TV shows were perceived that way when early video releases were done. That's why Turner and some other companies at the time chose to colorize them--bexause they did some market research where some consumers would be less likely to buy older shows. The purists and huge fans, of course, will not care but the studios need to appeal to as wide an audience as possible to make money back on these sets. Why not present both? Good argument but when that has been done-the original ""Battlestar Galatica"" excepted--the concern was that it added cost to the set as they have to reframe and redo some of the work and also confuse the average consumer or those who don't do their research.

I doubt that we will see these early seasons in 4:3 any time soon unless there is a great demand for them and they can justify the price by redoing these offsetting them. There are people called asset managers at studios that budget resources and figure out a way to justify the expense of redoing those seasons vs. spending their limited resources on other series. That's not an excuse just the nuts and bolts of Joe things operate.

The transfers were done at 2K--it is a pity that Fox chose NOT to do 4K as this locks the show at a lower resolution.

The sound is marvelous. They've done a nice job of repurposing the sound for 5.1 from stereo going back to the original stems/sound track elements. Dialog is clear even if you listen to The sound through stereo speakers although I should note it is a bit softer and a bit more lost in the mix compared to the original stereo sound track. It's not a huge difference but you might want to put on subtitles for scenes involving a lot of action in the sound department.

All of the extras as far as I can tell have been ported over to this new set. I haven't watched the entire series yet (what? It would be impossible in two days). I'm not going to go Into the special features here in depth as it's been covered before in w variety of reviews and there is, at the time I wrote this, an exhaustive list of what is included.

To Fox-great job! The price? Well it is too rich even for me. If you can get a deal, jump on it (that's the only way I would have gotten mine. I'm not willing to pay $299).shop around and check Fox's website for specials as well.

The $270 price point is absolutely ridiculous.

This is basically a box with 9 BR cases in it with the seasons. It is not even possible to tell what season you will be pulling out of the box since you open the box from the top.

There are no movies included (already knew this) but the kick in the teeth is that there IS a space for TWO more BR cases. But Fox decided to screw us over and glue a box on the INSIDE of the box to prevent a case with the movies going in. So you can only put in the new season inside since that spot is available.

The box look HUGE in the pictures, but when you get it and hold you think - hmmm really?

Honestly the series deserved more than this.

People who just give this a 5 star review need to check on expectations, otherwise every good series will be treated as poorly as this.

2193391,5,B0006SH25C,"Being the progenitor of many sci-fi TV shows that became global trends in recent years, the most legendary television programme of the '90s, THE X-FILES, is finally making its blu-ray appearance, after years in the process of remastering from the original 35mm negatives, presented in 16:9 widescreen format, and including new DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 tracks. All 202 episodes are featured, with more than 23 hours of special content across all 9 Seasons, and including bonus features from the previous DVD releases, such as audio commentaries, deleted scenes and featurettes. For the first time, we have the chance to own a piece of television history in superior quality, in the fasion of the glorious ""TWIN PEAKS: The entire mystery"" set from last year that was also finally presented in HD and in its entirety. Having created a huge buzz months before its release, here is the complete and official details, for those who wish to know exactly what the box includes, and also what it looks like.

Packaging: The box contains 9 - 1 for each Season- cases, and leaves a space reserved for the upcoming mini-series set (due to be released next year), all housed in a glossy, sturdy slide-off box set. All Seasons are 6-disc sets (except for Season 2 which, being the longest, is spread over 7 discs), presented in double, not regular-sized, clear blue amaray cases. Each Season contains all the episodes and special features from the individual Seasons-sets, which are now also available individually on blu-ray. No guides or booklets are included in the box, the only info available is an episode list and a special features list on the inside of each case. The discs of each season have different artwork on them. (Australian release features an additional 2 blu-ray discs for the feature films ""Fight the future"" and ""I want to believe""; Japanese box, also, includes the 2 films, plus, a poster, a set of cards with commissioned artwork, and an episode guide).

Picture/Audio: The entire show was originally broadcast in standard definition. As the series was launched after the early widescreen TV boom of the early '90s, it was filmed with widescreen in mind. The first 4 Seasons were produced in 4:3 format. The series then went to a 16:9 widescreen format for the remainder of its run, as anamorphic widescreen displays were starting to become common. Thus, it now appears as originally intended, which is rather amazing to watch after 2+ decades (only the pilot was shot somewhat differently, and so the result is some unavoidable cropping in order to get it looking right; but that is a minor gripe that only eagle-eyed viewers will notice). The sharpness is astounding, it is even more impressive than some HD footage shown on German TV a couple of years ago. The audio is equally impressive, crisp and clear. The extra features are presented in HD as well, indicative of the effort made to present a pristine package altogether.

To those interested in buying this, this will be of interest: I bought the UK box set for 140 (about $150). Amazon.com's $270 price is ridiculous, but amazon.uk's 100 plus p&p is one of the best deals at the moment. Both UK and US boxes feature the exact same material, which is exactly what one will get when purchasing all seasons individually (but why not have the complete thing when you can buy it at a good price?). If I could recommend one of the 2 sets, I would go for the UK box, because the packaging is better-looking (thicker outer-box, and all 9 cases are double ones - US box has 8 normal ones + 1 double for Season 2). The notes I have included about the picture and audio quality and the remastering are based on selective viewing. Obviously it will take a while to watch everything on here, but I will make an update if I encounter anything worth sharing. Let us all rejoice, this is super exciting, I am sure most avid fans of the show can share my enthusiasm! The truth is - finally - out there!

2193392,5,B0006SH25C,"Just in time...

I bought the first season on DVD when it came out.  But sadly I never bought the entire series maybe due to fact I probably watched every episode that aired in the beginning.  I remember seeing the promos for the pilot episode back in the early Fall of 1993.  It showcased what looked like FBI agents investigation an Alien Abduction event.  I was hooked.  I'm not sure if I would have been hooked from the beginning if they hadn't targeted the extra terrestrials story line for the pilot.  But from the very first episode you were hooked.  I remember seeing the scene where Fox Mulder is checking out some sort of lump on Dana Scully's naked body.  At the time the only redhead I liked was Dr. Beverly Crusher.  But after watching Gillian Anderson portray her for nearly a decade yeah things changed and she looks even better now when you can see her on Hannibal.  But very soon we will once again see them both in the new chronicles of the X-files miniseries.  We didn't get movie number three but this is just as good till that happens and it will.

For those who stuck with the X-files there was another beloved treat from James Wong and Glenn Morgan before they departed.

Space Above and Beyond - The Complete Series
http://www.amazon.com/Space-Above-Beyond-Complete-Series/dp/B000BCCAEQ

I wish this series had gotten more love and another season.  My only hope is if they can release it on Blu-ray one day in HD.  This series never got a chance to past the first and only season but I was also just as hooked and in some ways even more hooked onto this series than X-files when it came out.  Since they created it you can only blame them for liking something else they made.

Remember Trust No One except Deep Throat and The Lone Gunmen but avoid Cancer Man at all costs...",1449014400,7,1798,4.5625
2193393,5,B0006SH25C,"$14.99 for each season at target,$135.00 for the complete set,much better deal!",1448928000,10,79,5.666666666666667
2193394,3,B0006SH25C,"As of 11/30/15 you can buy all 9 seasons of the x-files on Blu-ray individually for $213.41; so I guess when the Collectors set falls well below the $200 range will be the time to buy; who would buy this set at the crazy price it is currently listed at?

As of 12/28/15 the 9 seasons are now $173.72. This is definitely better pricing. May want to snag the seasons going for $14.99 now and get the others when the price drops. That would put the total set cost around $150.00. Who needs a cardboard box for the extra money. If this set included something new and unique it might have been worth it. Sorry FOX, you goofed again!",1448841600,10,627,4.26890756302521

12/25/2015 - Look at all the people whining about my review and I was 100% right! People are paying 135$ extra just for a box! If you look around you can find every season at 15$ (9 x 15$ = 135$) and they are NO different than tho ones in the box set!",1448668800,15,410,3.823529411764706
2193399,4,B0006SH25C,"I am waiting on including the 5th start to see how they handle this. The BIG thing that's kept this from happening is the fact that HD was not a ""thing"" for most of the series. So, being on bluray now... Are all the earlier episodes still 4:3 or did they reformat for this update?? If so, wouldn't they need to redo any CG effects?? I know I know ""who the hell cares!?"" I'm just wondering.

2193421,3,B0006SH25C,I love this show but I am suprised more people don't talk about the unimpressive transfers of these dvds. Particularly the early seasons. They certainly don't look very good here. I watched this show when it aired and I am pretty sure it looked better way back then. Sharpness is is rather low and many dark scenes look washed out. The picture also seems strangely jittery particularly when the camera is panning. A letdown for such a great show. Hopefully a BD release is in its future.,1397001600,2,487,4.609195402298851

Season 5 is my favorite season and guess what? Faulty discs. Very annoying and cheap product. STAY away from this particular set!!",1394236800,,353,4.446153846153846
2193425,5,B0006SH25C,"""The X-Files"" box set is the ultimate viewing experience as it contains all episodes, special features and the two films.

The television series and movies cross numerous genres including: drama, horror, thriller, mystery and most notably science fiction. This provides viewers with diverse and highly interesting narratives, and also sets The X-Files apart as a franchise.

Perhaps letter Z of The X-Files story is still pending with the possibility of a third and final feature film, which is certainly something to look forward to.

What I received were the 9 seasons taped together with the new movies. Advertising for one product and selling another is called bait-and-switch, and last time I checked it wasn't legal. I've been very careful what I buy on Amazon because of how hard it is at times to know what you're really buying, and this is the first time I've been burned like this. AMAZON really needs to change their site and policies so that people get what they actually think they're buying.",1390262400,13,629,4.478260869565218

The exploration of Faith vs. Science (reason) goes back and forth in a very thoughtful manner throughout the 9 seasons.

2193430,5,B0006SH25C,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE X FILES!!!!! My uncle introduced me to the X Files this past summer and I have been hooked ever since!! It is the best tv show I have ever watched!! This show came out a few years before I was born but I still love this series. The love story of Mulder and Scully is I think the best romance I have ever seen! Especially one of the best tv love stories! Nothing else compares to this show. I am obsessed with everything about the X Files. The episodes have great plots and you never get bored. They usually leave things unanswered but most of them your forget about and they won't bother you to much! ;) It's a great sci-fi, mystery series. I think the series may of lasted at least 3 more years if David Duchovny had still wanted to go on with the series.

I chose to get the complete collector's edition of the x files because I saw how great my Uncles was. He got his set from Costco a few years after the series had ended and he loved the collectors edition. Upon seeing his I decided to come here to look for my own set.

All the ones that I saw on amazon even used were about $300.00 and my mom was not willing to pay that amount and neither was I, especially if it was used. So we searched for weeks until we finally found one for a reasonable price. I was thrilled. I did have my heart set on a new one, especially since I wanted the set to include all the goodies that came in the drawer on the inside of the box.

I contacted the seller and asked if there was a drawer to make sure I was not getting the wrong one, and he said he didn't even know that there was a drawer!! He said all the stuff inside was in mint condition. He said he had only watched the whole season once so the whole set was in pretty good condition. So I purchased the item and anxiously waited for my x files.

By the way, the box in the picture does not look like a light turquoise blue color, it looks like a nice royal blue with some shimmery silver.

The box came in even better shape than I expected. The bottom was pretty scratched up, but I didn't care since I would never see the bottom. But you should be aware with the box, it can scratch pretty easily so handle it with care. When scratched it shows a bright silvery under layer. If you drop it on its side you are sure to dent a corner. And I would try not to open and close it as much as you can help. It starts to show crease marks and you start to see silver in the cracks, so if you are planning to watch the whole set, like I did, I would leave the bottom drawer open like I did so that the magnetic lid will not have to reattach and unattach itself every time you want to get in it. There were a few minor scratches to the front of the box along with some wear marks on my box, but your really don't notice. Especially if your are not paying attention. The first few seasons showed a little bit of ware on the spine and edges of them, but not a big deal. The discs were almost prefect!! They pretty much looked brand new. I only found a few minor scratches on maybe two of the discs and they all played perfectly. I really loved the bonus discs, which was part of the reason why I also wanted the set. It includes special features for some of the episodes that are on the episode discs and then you get even more on the separate bonus disc about the whole season and some behind the scenes. There is a bonus disc for every season and you get the ""Fight The Future"" movie that you watch between seasons 5 and 6. But let me tell you, that movie was awesome!! They made the movies plot to where if you were an x file regular you would have a little more information about what was going on. But even if you were someone who was watching anything x file related for the first time you still wouldn't be lost. It would still make perfect sense, you could still follow along, and it would be an awesome movie.

Finally I am going to give a brief summary of what is in the drawer. Since the man who sold me this set didn't even know that the drawer existed, I got everything that came in the drawer in mint condition! Which I was super happy about. If everything is included you should get, an X Files summary guide for all the seasons and a short description about the movie, collectable cards about some of the episodes for Season 1, a comic book, and the X Files ""Fight The Future"" movie poster. If you can't get all of these things, I would at least try to order one that included the x files summary guide. Its really helpful and you can look up an episode you want to watch with ease. It tells you which season and episode, gives a short summary and a picture of the episode. I really loved this booklet.

Overall the set was really, really great. I adore it so much and I am so glad that I finally found one at a reasonable price. If you are an ultimate X Phile like me then you should defiantly get this Collectors set, it was one of the best purchases I have ever made! :)",1386633600,3,4947,4.072895277207392

2193449,2,B0006SH25C,"The first season was good entertainment. Things become garbled in season 2. The race to the bottom begins in the season 3 finale. The series hits rock bottom in seasons 6 and 7.

An entire website has been dedicated to documenting Chris Carter and his writers' disastrous decisions, specifically in regards to the main mythology. Everyone knows the 'monster of the week' episodes were grist for Fox but a decent amount were clever, especially Vince Gillians's episodes. Yet, even these degenerated when Duchovny and Anderson's characters were gutted by the writers. The website is:[...]
The show's mystery was extinguished. The Smoking Man was trivialized. The Informants disappear into thin air. The mythology was too interspersed between the grist episodes, which only became monotonized later on, and consequentially was never developed. Thus, plot holes, seemingly crucial detail from story-lines, characters and inexplicable events are scattered all over the place. Some are dropped while others linger on.

At season 3 and onward, it felt as if Carter was just making stuff up on the fly to keep the thing rolling. Fox was probably offering him a ton of money to do so, but that's not sufficiently blameworthy. It could have been done better. Carter said the show should 'evolve', which amounted to ruining Mulder's impetus (and thus the show), his sister's disappearance, and contriving a few tasteless 'comedic' episodes stuffed with toilet humor. The writers should have maintained the nature of series 1. Instead they and all of the actors and actress's subsequent careers were engulfed in the show's implosion. And Carter always tried to deny this. Where is he today? He is back surfing 24/7.",1359504000,,1703,5.211678832116788

The following is my thoughts about the show, not the product being sold (I saw some negative reviews about that). To keep this short, the concept of the show is good, but I felt the deviations away from the main theme of the ""alien/government conspiracy"" was just filler for the FOX network to capitalize on. It seemed that the show picked up steam when that theme was present. The annoying deviations I'm referring to were episodes that dealt with various, and many times laughable, assorted creatures or other non-alien related ""paranormal"" phenomenon. Bottom line: I don't regret watching this show, but I'm glad I spent as little as possible (I watched it on a popular online video streaming service).",1359072000,,812,4.848920863309353

2193456,4,B0006SH25C,"I'm very ambivalent towards ""The X-Files"".

The claustrophobic conspiracism of Chris Carter's series feels even more relevant today than it did during the 1990's, when guys like Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela and Vaclav Havel at least created the illusion that progress, prosperity and democracy were on the rise. I didn't believe it either, and precisely for that reason I felt almost suffocated by the pessimistic super-conspiracism of ""The X-Files"". The series was darker than anything I could come up with.

On the other hand, it was often great fun to watch the ""monster of the week"" episodes, especially since they were often intended to poke fun at the paranormal. (Back then, I was a self-proclaimed atheist and materialist.) The monsters in the series often smacked me as being even more bizarre than those mentioned in the Fortean magazines I read as a kind of guilty pleasure. John Keel was a pretty conventional guy compared to Fox Mulder and Dana Scully! The best episode features a green alien dragon abducting two teenagers, and makes excellent fun of the entire UFO-conspiracist subculture.

But, of course, the main plot of ""The X-Files"" is the increasingly complex and convoluted battle between Mulder and a UFO-related government conspiracy, led by Cancer Man a.k.a. The Smoker. Many conspiracy theories are inherently pessimistic, and ""The X-Files"" never really resolves the issue either - the last episode is a cop-out of major proportions, with Mulder realizing that humans are immortal souls, and that the alien invasion of 2012 therefore doesn't matter much. An almost literal deux ex machina!

Still, ""The X-Files"" is an interesting pop culture phenomenon, with its mainstreaming of conspiracy theories usually associated with the lunatic fringe. The Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter even attacked the series on its editorial page about 10 years ago. The attack was written by one of those ""official optimists"" who believed that ""The X-Files"" might have worked during the pessimistic (!) atmosphere of the 1990's, but during the glorious 2000's, with all curves pointing upwards, it felt like a bizarre anachronism. I wonder where this guy is today? Probably in the same editorial office, desperately attacking all ""extremists"" who want to ""take advantage"" of the Euro-crisis. Ah, feels like the ""pessimistic"" 1990's all over again...

I'm not sure how to rate the claustrophobic, lunatic, fringey, hilarious ""X-Files"", but eventually I give it four stars.

All of the acting is great, and the interwoven plot lines are fantastic. To have it all unedited and without lousy commercials is heavenly.  There are some bonus materials, but overall I would have liked to have seen more.

The only real complaint I have is that Fox did a very poor job of transferring these to DVD, especially since this was a flagship show for them.  The first 4 seasons' episodes look like total crap - very grainy overall and the dark colors look absolutely horrid - even when played on a Blu-Ray, which supposedly upconverts the quality.  However, as the series goes on, the picture quality gets better, with the occasional episode still looking bad.  Thankfully, the sound quality is solid throughout.

The only drawback is in the packaging which is a bit under par from what I and some others have experienced. Although the case it's self is a work of art, you MUST handle it carefully! Mine is cracking at the seams where it unfolds to reveal the discs and so I have consequently had to Package tape it to ensure it's survival.

It lasted too long, the F/X and film quality as well as the story lines were simply too good to be true. Several different writers were brought in for many episodes including the master of horror, Steven King (Chinga, Season 5) and the writing and directing skills from both stars, Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny.

Of all the complete sets of TV shows I own on DVD/Blu-ray, the packaging of this X-Files set has fared the worst. By the time Amazon delivered the product to me, the cardboard cover/flap (which goes over the opening of the box revealing the DVDs and falls across the widest side of the box) had broken off. So I now just hang that part of the cover on my wall since it serves no purpose to put it back together with the box. The DVD cases (paperback book type covers) also had worn out around the edges by the time it was delivered to me, but the DVDs were unharmed. However, having now watched the entire series over the past year, and having handled the case and DVDs with extreme care and only during this rewatch since I bought the product, I have now had to buy new plastic DVD containers myself and transfer all the DVDs to them because the box/cases simply cannot handle them anymore. The photos that you see printed on the box are also printed papers that are stuck to the box that came off about a year ago. (More for the wall! Sigh.)

It arrived really really beat up.  Most of the damage was hard to see until the shrink wrap was off and I really think this item was damaged and re shrunk or maybe sent back and re shrunk and then sold again.  Not acceptable to send out a product in this shape.  The lid hinge is completely broken and torn, it looks like it's been opened hundreds of times.  There are other scratches and tears and there is wear on every one of the season containers.  I have real concerns about the disks, some appear scratched and all are smudged and dirty.  All of the first season played as well as a dozen or so I tried at random. But.. I really think it's likely some will have problems.  Amazon gave us two options when we complained and we picked one, but the option I really wanted to return this one, and have them send us a set in at least decent shape. That wasn't offered.  If condition issues bother you, I would strongly recommend you let this once pass you by.  I was very disappointed.  This series deserved way better handling.",1301961600,5,1181,4.246636771300448
2193480,5,B0006SH25C,"I assume most people contemplating buying this set already know what they're getting into so I won't review the show, just the set.

I got this about two years ago.  I read lots of complaints about the sturdiness of the box, so I took someones advice from another review and turned the bottom drawer that contains the poster, comic book, episode guide, etc. upside down.  My box is still in great shape so maybe that does help support the weight of the DVDs.  I've made it all the way through the set and every DVD played fine, no defects.  I'm very pleased.

As most of you know, this contains every season of The X-Files and the first feature film.  This does not contain ""The X-Files: I Want To Believe"" as this box set was made before that films release.  They can't really help that.

Included are ALL special features from the original DVD sets.  It's great to have them available again.  Each season includes a featurette, deleted scenes, audio commentaries, a DVD-ROM game, TV promos and assorted behind-the-scenes stuff throughout (special effects clips, interviews, etc.).  The X-Files was the first TV show to be released on DVD and they set a great standard, going all out.  Also included is a bonus disc with the featurettes from the Mythology set releases.

The nick-knacks are inessential but a nice addition.  There's an episode guide, a cool poster for the movie which I hung on my wall, a comic book (mine came with two copies!), and art cards.  The episode guide contains a few paragraphs about the season, a list of all episodes with a small still and short description of each.  It's nice but don't get your hopes up, it's nothing that would be sold by itself.

Great set if you want to get all the seasons at once with all the special features, as most of the single season sets in print right now don't include the bonus discs.  The price is a little high right now. When I bought it two years ago, it was $150 on Amazon.  No idea why it's jumped over $100.  I thought prices usually go down after time.",1300147200,3,2026,4.526170798898072
2193481,1,B0006SH25C,"I have never written a review of an Amazon purchase, good or bad, before so you can imagine how upset I must be to pen one now.  The fact that I had anticipated purchasing this set for over a year just adds to the utter disgust that I now feel.  I really wish I had read through the 1 and 2 star reviews better before I ordered this item because I would have known to inspect all the discs immediately upon receipt.  The first 2 episodes on the season 1 disc 1 played with no problem, but episode 3 was so bad that it hung up Power DVD on the Dell desktop to the point that I had to use Task Manager to shut it down and I could never get the episode to finish.  I examined the disc and found scratches, so I figured they were either an anomaly or something I caused by accident.  Especially after episode 4 played ok as well as episode 1 on disc 2.  However when I got to episode 2 on disc 2- once again I was unable to get the episode to finish on either the dell desktop or laptop.  This disc was scratched, as was every other disc in season 1.  I'm so discouraged now that I don't even want to bother checking the other eight seasons' worth of discs and to add insult to injury, my return window expired on 1/31/11, so my only recourse now will be to contact Amazon customer service and see what they will do for me.  Hey, I have given Amazon a lot of money over the years, so maybe we can work something out.  Shame on Fox, you would think they would put out a better product than this.  They are as bad as ABC not making episodes of the new ""V"" available online this season.",1298678400,12,1579,4.028846153846154

For anyone who was/is a fan of the series, this set is your ticket - packaged very nicely; the extras are cool plus you can't beat the price - I originally was going to buy Season 1 when it was first released, but not for $80!

2193483,4,B0006SH25C,"With even greater influence than ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits,"" ""The X-Files really charted unknown waters.  Making such a long-lasting series out of a couple of renegade FBI agents investigating the paranormal was an accomplishment that no one could have predicted -- and, naturally, this lack of preparation and planning created numerous inconsistencies -- especially with the eventually tiresome track of an alien invasion.  The best episodes were those that stood on their own and didn't seek any stake in the soap-operaish alien theme.  But, with any series that extends long after its expiration date, the writers continued to churn out stories that were (for the most part) engaging and highly entertaining.  Gillian Anderson provided ALL of the backbone and genuine drama.  Duchovny was at his best when delivering witty quips and displaying a deprecating sarcasm toward his superiors.  Toward the end of his tenure, I got the sense that he was just walking through the scripts.  It was high time for him to go or for the series to end, but the show went on.  With Duchovny out, Anderson stepped up her performance to an even higher notch to make up for any slack.  Robert Patrick was a breath of fresh air from the suffocating Duchovny-Anderson relationship (that should never have happened).  Patrick, coming at The X-Files as a complete skeptic, was a smart way of revitalizing the initial dynamic of the program (where, originally, Scully was the skeptic, and Duchovny was the ""believer"" or at least would-be believer).  Without the awards and accolades garnered by ""The X-Files,"" we wouldn't be seeing the avalanche of sci fi/paranormal programs now shown on television.  The full body of work is impressive and will survive as a kind of historical photo album of the TV broadcasting limits existing in its time.",1298332800,,1837,5.0664451827242525

The Collector's set includes the 1998 movie ""The X-Files: Fight the Future"", trading cards, a comic book and a poster promoting the movie. I do feel that the full price, as listed on Amazon, is way too much for this set. I am still a big fan of ""The X-Files"" after all these years, however, I would never be willing to pay nearly $300.00 for a set that is NOT Blu-Ray, and for a DVD set of a television series which has been off-air for about 8 years now.

2193487,3,B0006SH25C,"First of all, i have made several purchases with amazon and except a few occasional slightly damaged items i am a very satisfied customer. However, i believe there may be a production issue with this box set since at least five of the thirty dvds i have already viewed from it have been partly unreadable. In almost every case, the reading became difficult or impossible at the end of the second episode(last 2-3 chapters) on those dvds and continued for almost the entirety of the third episode of the dvd,and generally without affecting the fourth and last episode contained on the media. I did manage to read everyone of those dvds with two different blu-ray readers from Sony without even any stutter,but this solution is letting me puzzled as to the precise probable cause of this problem. I also tried six different dvd players but only managed to get minimal improvement of readability. In all of the devices i used, i also experienced extremely loud noise while some of my viewing. In short, the price at amazon.com is quite good for this product (cost me about 3$can per dvd after shipping and duties) and the box corners arrived with superficial damage, which would of happened anyways in my opinion, but the playback difficulties might be a big inconvenient for some.",1294531200,,1278,4.8136363636363635
2193488,5,B0006SH25C,"When I first encountered with the ""X-Files"", I had the impression that this was something brilliant and very well done. I still think the same and with this set, I can now be sure to see every episode and movies of that TV show. Everything, I mean absolutely everything is included in this collector's box set. All the DVD from the weekly TV episode from start to finish, both movies, a poster from the first movie and even a book that tell you the facts about the X Files. All of this stuff is neatly offered in a large box that ressemble a chest. When opening the top, you find all the DVDs and underneath, in a convinient drawer, you will find the book and the poster. To me, it is the largest DVD set I have ever seen and beacause of ti's size, some shipping issue were brought up. The size and weight of this thing made the shipping fees skyrocketed along with custom duties made a final bill of more than $400.00 canadian dollards. When I first saw all the buying option, the DVD set stated at around %175.00 and the highest priced one was at more thant $300.00. I have tried several time with different sellers to get the box set at lowest price possible but, everytime I would have to get another seller beacause it was impossible to ship to my adress until I came to the box set offered by amazone at around $260.00. They were able to ship it at my place but with the extra shipping charges for size & weight. This coupled with custom duties & money exchange rate came up to a bill of over $400.00 Can. So if you are to buy this DVD box set, BEWARE OF SHIPPING CHARGES that might turn into a surprise! The first time I saw this Box set it was in a local store at my place and it was priced at $350.00 can. If you add fedral & provincial taxes you come up to a price of slightly above $400.00 Cana so in the end, I mght have paid let's say $20.00 can more than I would have paid for the one box set offered here but,the box set that was here in my town is no longer available and the only place I saw such a set was on amazone  and starting at less than $300.00, I sure saw it as a big deal! But I would have never tought that it's price would total up so much so remeber: It's the nicest DVD set offering I have never seen and everything about it is beyond comparison so if you want to buy it, treat yourself but, keep in mind that it is a very large and heavy item and that shipping it to your place will probably cost more than usual. By the way, despite it's size, this box set is made in a way that it will fit in your DVD case shelf, armoire, or anything else you have at home to stow your DVD collection.",1291507200,,2619,4.075581395348837

2193490,5,B0006SH25C,"The X-Files is one of the best show that's been on television, in fact it has been brilliant, up until the last couple of seasons. When Mulder began disappearing in the early part of season 8, the quality of the show began to fade away along with him.

To me the essence of The X-Files is the combination of Scully and Mulder working together to solve the mysteries of the unknown, and without that team work, it's almost not worth watching. They had a unique balance between each other that consisted of mutual respect of each other's differences and a great friendship that helped them overcome all the odds they faced over the series' 9 seasons run.

The subtle and quirky humor Mulder had was one of many things that made the show so excellent, and the yin and yang like qualities that were seen in both Mulder and Scully perfectly complemented each other and created a dynamic relationship that forever changed the face of television, not to mention the tremendous character development seen as both grew older and wiser. It was very interesting to see how their platonic love evolved over the years to become a romantic, deep and transcendental love.

The show's cast over the years was excellent, with such unforgettable characters as Alex Krycek, the Cigarette Smoking Man CGB Spender, Assistant FBI director Walter Skinner and the list goes on. Despite numerous continuity problems with some of the characters, especially regarding Mulder's sister and the arching storyline of the government-alien conspiracy, the show remained intriguing and enchanting.

All that changed once John Dogget and Monica Reyes replaced Mulder as the show's other half, and although they've proven themselves as good actors, nobody can make up for the loss of the series' main character. It would be like watching Seinfeld without Seinfeld, or Star Wars without Luke Skywalker, in other words there is virtually no show without either character, because the series is based on that central character, or combination of characters.

I knew 'The X-Files would not last without Fox Mulder, and that the ratings would bottom out, and they did, which led to the show's cancellation. Even though I will greatly miss The X-Files, I was glad to see it end on a good note (Mulder returns in the final episode) rather than to have it drag out into obscureness with characters that have really nothing to do with what 'The X-Files' was all about, such as the super-soldiers sub-plot. The heart of the show was Mulder, with the aid of Scully, figuring out the far-reaching conspiracy while solving the occult and unexplained.

Even the last two seasons which were the weakest are still far better than most TV series, past and present. I have this collection because a series this great is worth owning forever, and I know there will never be a series quite like it, nor as good.

The corners had been beat up and the shrink-wrap around the box was unusually loose and torn.  I should have followed my gut instinct and sent it back right away, although I couldn't find a replacement anywhere.  (It's not an easy collection to find).  So, I wrapped it up and gave it her.  When she opened the package it was VERY DISAPPOINTING to find each booklet had worn corners and the DVD's were scratched and dirty.  Clearly this was a used product re-packaged by Amazon and sold as new.  For $300 there was no way we were even going to play a DVD.  It got sent back.

The reason for the two stars and not one is because most of the fault with this is on Amazon, not the product.  We really didn't try the DVD's to see if they had problems.  The box though didn't look very well built and I'm not a big fan of the cardboard holders.  You can find the complete seasons for around $25 each.  $25 x 9 = $225.

2193504,1,B0006SH25C,"Yes, like a lot of other reviewers point out, many of these disks are faulty and that sucks a lot of value and enjoyment out of the content. The disks are faulty in the sense that they don't play well on a range of players. I have four DVD players around the house each of which stumbles over the discs at some point or another so I have to chop and change. It can be an irritating process and it means I can't just sit and watch the discs where I choose - instead, the discs often dictate where and therefore when I can watch them. None of the many hundreds of other DVDs and Blu Rays I own behave like this.

Other reviews say enough about the content which is, of course, excellent. But the poor quality of the disks, and the consequent inability to access that content, makes that fact to some degree irrelevant.

UPDATE: I've downgraded my rating from ** to *. These disks are maddening. If I can't watch the material I've bought, how is that different from not having the material at all?

2193515,5,B0006SH25C,"If you're a big fan of the series then this massive 60+ disc DVD set is just what the doctor ordered. Take a trip back in time to the 90s where television was at its golden age and where Fox reinvented the Sci-Fi genre with this definitive and ground breaking series. The boxed set includes all 9 complete seasons of the X-Files, the full-feature film Fight The Future, and numerous special features and bonus material including some very Lovecraftian art cards based off of the first season that are a personal favourite of mine. Just rewatching the first season just brings back so many great memories of the show and as you progress through the boxed set from season to season you see the acting and special effects improve and for the most part the story. Just watching some of the cheesier episodes early on as well as the cheesy effects is just classic in retrospect. This series was so far ahead of its time that it's unbelievable. Although some hardcore X-Files fans would conclude that the series really ends at the onset of season 8 with Mulder no longer being a regular on the show, the last two seasons still do have something to offer in terms to rounding out the story despite not being on par with the first seven. The extras are great too, especially the mythos/monster of the week ones and the gag reels are just hilarious. If you're new to the show then I suggest renting the first season and seeing if it's your cup of tea. If you enjoy government conspiracies, aliens, monsters of the week, and the paranormal then you'll definitely enjoy the X-Files.",1260748800,,1571,4.594306049822064
2193516,5,B0006SH25C,"This gargantuan DVD box set features every episode (plus the 1998 film) from all nine seasons (1993-2002) of THE X FILES; its release provides an opportunity to assess what is in all probability the single greatest television show ever aired.

Although a casual awareness of the X FILES may bring to mind government conspiracy, aliens, ""spooky"" supernatural phenomenon, the core issues in the show are that of truth, faith, love, good and evil; in other words, those issues that have captivated mankind's imagination for as long as it has had the capacity to record its artistic, philosophical and revelatory reactions. Over the course of the series, Chris Carter and the ""1013"" productions team were put to the test in coming up with interesting and (somewhat) cohesive storylines that would weave the aforementioned themes in and around the practical (business related) realities they faced behind the scenes. Though not without missteps, the dramatic intensity of the myth arc was maintained in a slow but inexorable journey that (bit by bit) revealed much of Carter's culturally subversive ""underground project"" (culminating in the beautifully moving final scene of the series finale).

In so many areas, whether it be writing, acting or the sheer beauty of the production, THE X FILES was truly a miracle occurring in a medium which doesn't often rise above mediocrity. The credit for this phenomenon was shared amongst many dedicated individuals, most working behind the scenes. The ""1013"" production team delighted in playful, embedded concepts that recurred time and again in the background of the show. Without going into ridiculous detail, there was a certain archetypal X FILES iconography which developed more and more with each successive season: fondness for neon lights or flashing sirens of ambulances and police cars; a humorously morbid fascination with the bathroom as a crime scene (etc). One of the true beauties of the X FILES was that it was so layered that one could appreciate it on any one of a number of levels; this is why it's possible to watch these episodes over and over again and not be bored.

Composer Mark Snow's custom tailored music was simply gold: consistently excellent, moving work (with the occasional sly quote from classical composers woven in).

The directors (especially Rob Bowman and the stalwart Kim Manners) framed their shots in very interesting ways. The lighting, sets and camera work were redolent of high quality film making (television standards were left in the dust).

The writers (truly the core of the show) created complex scripts that challenged the considerable talents of Anderson and Duchovny (not to mention the numerous excellent guest actors chosen by superb casting agents). And if irony constitutes one of the primary elements in the work of great authors, the core writing staff (Frank Spotnitz, Vince Gilligan, Darin and Glen Morgan) could at least be described as having strived for greatness. The self-reflexive humor constantly on display in FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully fleshed out the nuances appropriate to the background of these unique personalities.

Obviously, a very strong part of THE X FILES' appeal is the complex relationship between the main characters. However, one needn't be married to the notion that the show revolved completely around (what eventually evolved into) a romantic relationship; it's sufficient to acknowledge the respect, camaraderie and genuine love (both in its platonic & romantic phases) the two share. Mulder and Scully, two deeply serious (however witty) people helped, through trust and self-sacrifice, ""ground"" each other in their respective quests.

Finally, regardless of what some embittered fans may opine, Chris Carter, as the creator of the show, deserves credit for having continually guided his creation (a labor of love) over nine grueling years. For many seasons he maintained the integrity of an artistic vision that the Fox executives were smart enough to take a gamble on (given the ""franchise"" nature of the X FILES, their gamble certainly paid off). And, if parts of the final seasons were rough, Carter and company's overall achievement can with certainty be termed magnificent.

To conclude: in terms of a ""bare bones"" grading approach, the individual seasons ( + 1998 film ) contained in this DVD box set can be summed up as follows:

SEASON 1 ( 1993-94 ): A-
SEASON 2 ( 1994-95 ): A
SEASON 3 ( 1995-96 ): A+
SEASON 4 ( 1996-97 ): A
SEASON 5 ( 1997-98 ): A

SEASON 8 ( 2000-01 ): B-

I ended up hating this series because I got sick and tired of them NEVER resolving a story but always leaving you hanging and totally confused. Each episode teases and teases and then NEVER resolves the story. Really pissed me off. I watched the entire series and still don't have a f*$*ing clue what in the hell it was about. The only highlight is the set packaging which is really good.

Addendum April 10, 2013
  The above is my initial review because The X-Files totally confused me. I did some research and learned how to make sense of this show. The X-Files is actually 5 shows in one, which is why it can be confusing. There are stand alone ""creature feature"" segments, and 4 mythology segments..Abduction, Black Oil, Colonization and Super Soldiers. Here is the break-down from the set as best as I could research it.

2193524,5,B0006SH25C,"Ok, as with a few other reviewers, the last season and a half or so (with the exception of the series finale) absolutely sucked animal 'nads.  But still, overall, this is one of the best Sci-fi series ever made.  Seasons one thru five totally rock, seasons six and seven tell you everything you need to know and rock, seasons eight and nine, blah.  I mean, they had their moments (anything with Mulder and Scully), but you can tell they were grasping at thin air trying to come up with storylines.  The bonus features are great as well.  It still plays good. My biggest complaint I guess, and this is just nitpicking a little, but in the episode ""Jumping the Shark"" when the Gunmen die, they should have done the montage at the end without voice-over.  You know, do the funeral scene, then do the montage showing them from first appearance to then.  I didn't think the voice-over by Morris really did the Gunmen justice, but that's just one humble Philers opinion.",1247961600,,964,4.60233918128655

I was SO excited to get this box set.  I thought it was an amazing value for the cost (I ordered it when it was $160 new).  I received the box in great condition and was very relieved since I had heard so many people had gotten boxes that were broken or damaged in some way.

I inspected each disc and made sure they came with all of the correct seasons and discs... another problem some people faced.  Everything was in order.

I watched through the entire first disc of season 1 and it was fine.  A few tiny skips in the playback but nothing I couldn't deal with.  When I put in the second disc it would not play, at all.  The disc could not be read by my DVD player, or my computer, or my other DVD player.  I tried brushing it off, wiping it down, everything, but it would not play.  I tried disc 3 and 4 with the same problems.

Hoping it was just a season 1 flaw, I put in a few discs from other seasons, and they would not play either.  Apparently, only season 1 disc 1 worked at all.

At this point I was completely discouraged and had to ship them back to Amazon.  I am still waiting to receive the refund I should be getting... and am not sure if I will order them from another seller or not, as Amazon has stopped selling them now (maybe because of all the problems??)

I know that other people have had success with this series and I am really hoping that I will be able to get one that works at some point, but at this time I would not recommend this low quality product that Fox put out without much care.",1242086400,19,1725,4.5732899022801305

2193532,4,B0006SH25C,"I just finished watching the entire series from beginning to end. It took me about a month, I got the box set. I hadn't seen the show sense the series ended back in 2002. I orginally gave the show a 5 stars but after watching it from the beginning to the end after all this time I gave it a 4. I was going to give it a 3, but the last two episodes were just great so I bumped it back up. Now onto the review

X-Files, a show that lasted a few seasons to long but still ended on a high note.

X-Files was a unique show when it first came on back in 1993, I'd never seen anything like it. Capturing my imagination about aliens, monsters, and the like. The characters were great. I'd break down the series into four chapters.

X-Files seasons 1-2: The beginning we see Mulder and Scully for the first time and are introduced to many other like the THE LONE GUNMEN, CSM, Skinner and others.

X-Files seasons 3-5: The relationship between Mulder and Scully crows even more with Scully's cancer. We go deeper into the alien conspiracy and into other characters lives and characters die like X. The stories are great and are leading to a climax.

X-Files seasons 6-7+movie movie: At the end of season 7 is when the show should have ended. David Duchovny was leaving the show. The characters of Mulder and Scully had reached a point where they loved each other even if they didn't say it. The stories were reaching conclusions, we learned what happened to Mulder's sister, the group behind the conspiracy were all but dead. In my opinion the show had reached it's climax. There wasn't anything new to add. This is when the show was a 4 or a 5 stars.

X-Files seasons 8-9: The show goes way down hill here. First Mulder is gone, then we get Scully's miracle baby. I mean come on, that was defiantly a desperate attempt to keep the show going for another two years. The addition of John Doggett played by Robert Patrick, and I like the actor he just didn't fit in well with the show. The stories began to go way down hill unless they focused directly on Mulder and Scully's relationship, everything else sucked. The only thing that saved the show from getting a 3 or even a 2 was the series finale two episodes. They were just great, you could tell the actors were moved by it coming to the end. Ultimately the show wasn't a classic or great but very good and I would recommend everyone to watch the series.",1240704000,3,2397,4.351230425055928
2193533,5,B0006SH25C,"I'm not really a big TV watcher. Yet for some reason, this TV series captivates me. When I initially saw the series for the first time, I was so impressed with the stories that I just couldn't stop watching them. I went through all nine seasons within a matter of weeks.

Now I find myself unsure of what to do, and so sad that there was ""only"" nine seasons. Yes, this series is just that good. Everything about it...the characters... story... the epic theme music... it is all just so well done that it's hard for me to accurately put it into words.

If you are interested in crime solving type shows, the paranormal, the supernatural, or just a fantastic TV series unlike any other you've ever seen, the X-Files is for you.",1240704000,,725,4.443609022556391

Once you watch you honestly can't stop. It's most enjoyable if you have the benefit of watching every episode from the beginning in order. There are many subtle back referances and an ongoing underlying story line that will have you watching hours on end.

The box set itself is beautiful with great box art. Each season is seperated into it's own case inside the box and the box itself closes with a magnetic fold over top. The bottom of the box also has a small pull draw that opens to reveal several x-files memorabilia goodies.

The set also includes an episode guide which really comes in handy when you're looking for a particular episode.  I wish the set came with more extras- the comic and trading cards were pretty unimpressive.  Still, I am giving this set five stars because this was one of the best sci-fi shows ever, and a must have for any fan(unless you own the individual seasons already).",1233619200,2,574,4.490384615384615

I'll take a disk out, watch It, and put it back.  When I'm finished watching all the episodes, in about a year, I probably won't touch it again for another 10 years.  Maybe the kids will be interested in the X-files at some point, but even then the disk won't have been dragged across the surface of a cardboard sleeve more than six times in the next decade.  I think the disks can withstand the abuse - don't worry about the packaging!

(It's interesting how, in today's more cynical atmosphere, their modest and covert government conspiracies seem almost... quaint.) I had the first three of the original season by season releases, and some of those discs had problems; these are flawless so far.

The packaging is fabulous, a flip-top case with 10 little pocketed books that are like miniature versions of old 78 record albums. The books make it easy to get the discs in & out, which means you're not juggling a clumsy yard-long fold-out with one hand and trying to put the DVD in with the other. For me, that translates into actually putting them away.

  Well, NO REGRETS here, let me say!  Of all the Christmas presents opened by our family last month, this is the one that is giving everyone the most enjoyment.  None of us--even the old folks <g>--had seen the entire series completely in order (I started mid-series and had to watch the early stuff all jumbled up, on cable) and my daughter was just a little kid when X-Files started, so we're all enthralled with the chance to watch the evolution of the show, and the character development, in order...

  Additionally, every few nights (we're into Season 2, now) we stumble upon that rarest-of-the-rare, that Shangri La, that undiscovered gem: an episode NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN!  What a thrill!  What a cause for celebration!

It comes with every season 1-9 in individually packaged hard cover ""books"" where you flip the pages for each disk. It also includes loads of deleted scenes, the first X-Files movie, a pull out drawer with a poster, original artwork cards, a cartoon X-files comic book, etc, etc!

Obviously if you own a few sets of this show, don't bother getting it since you'll just be getting the same stuff, but if you want to own a great series in a great box (with magnets to keep it closed!) then this is the thing to buy.

I saw a lot of comments about the box falling apart. I don't know how their boxes fell apart since mine came very sturdy ""cardboard"" like, it's very stiff. I mean i've only had it for 3 days now, so I guess only time can tell, but the way i've moved it around and felt it, the only way this box is falling apart is if you're abusing it in some way.

We didn't get very far (probably into season 2), but recently we viewed all of the seasons and just finished. This is one of the best, most clever and humorous shows I've ever seen. The transfer leaves much to be desired, especially the earlier seasons.

The episodes introduce interesting phenomena, and interweave the mystery of the UFO phenomena, with wit and edginess. If you've never seen the seasons, it's never too late. It's a great blend of scientific explanation unexplained occurrences, that leave you wondering and guessing. Magnificent show, not to be missed by anyone interested in UFO's, the paranormal, and the unexplained. I was fortunate to have watched the entire set in a few months time, to not lose any continuity.

2193558,5,B0006SH25C,"The X Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X Files so enjoyable. The inside DVD case is nothing special and even has some failings with some editions coming with a seventh bonus disc that is just sitting in a slot in a piece of card and falls out easily, bouncing around the box. However not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 discs in total for a grand total of 24 episodes. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are sometimes commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material for most seasons except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. Other seasons have more bonus material. The actual presentation is not short of shoddy work. They could have at least provided us with the X Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap... but it is still the X Files. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained. It is not until season 5 that the X Files go Widescreen 1.78:1

Season 1:
(*****/5)
The Paranormal Anthology of a Lifetime starts right here
The X Files: Season one, delivers as a fine example of how such a simple premise can land like a bombshell on the international television scene. There are no real cheap budget restrictions evident either, as what is on display is mostly quality acting and storytelling using natural American environments. Most of the characters in the X Files series are found in the pilot episode `pilot' on disc 1, however Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) doesn't show up until near the end half of the Season in episode 20 - `Tooms'. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) does not appear in the Pilot show, but is in the first episode. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) appear in episode 16 - `EBE'. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) makes quite a few appearances. The series gels from the word go with some enthralling SF thought and implementation. Not since Star Trek had the world seen a series like it before. Apart from a lot of episodes borrowing from films like `Wolften' and `The Thing' the X Files was doing wholly new stuff that even movies like `Good Will Hunting' have borrowed from. Season one of the X Files is mostly about alien abductions, government conspiracies, shape shifters, wild men, poltergeists, artificial intelligence, body snatching parasites, the face on Mars, UFO crashes, eugenics, psychics, hermaphrodites, possession, aging, faith healing, werewolves, alien insects, alien bacteria, reincarnation and alien DNA. Although many of shows might not be completely logically and even have some serious plot holes, the general weirdness going on still makes the show one of the best ever. `EBE' is the most popular show in Season One, next to the cliff-hanger last episode `The Erlenmeyer Flask'. `Fallen Angel' is a classic UFO crash X Files episode, `Shapes' is scary and `Darkness Falls' is a great original alien story. The bottom line for The X Files: season one is that it is a classic. It is not necessarily the most conspiracy orientated X Files season because it covers a lot of paranormal ground. The real bonus is seeing Mulder and Scully looking really young.

Season 2:
(*****/5)
The Critically Acclaimed Season II
Although X Files: Season one landed like a bombshell on the international television scene, it was Season two that sent it flying up the rankings with Mulder and Scully on every magazine cover from the bottom to the top shelf. Season two kicks off from the cliff-hanger ending of Season one where the X Files has been shutdown, Mulder and Scully have been reassigned to separate bureau departments and Deep throat has been murdered. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is in from the start, this time with a more active role in the field along with the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund), who are all reoccurring characters from Season one. Deep Throat has been replaced by a new Deep Throat character, the mysterious Mr X (Steven Williams) and Mulder has been teamed up with a new agent named Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) who may be working for the Cigarette-Smoking Man. There are also more revelations about Mulder's missing sister and some strange history about his dad. So the season starts very differently, upping the paranoia levels with a stronger focus on government conspiracy and developing this theme throughout most of the episodes. There is also much more hard-hitting action and gets very violent in parts with Scully even getting beaten-up badly in most episodes. Season one was more about delivering individual episodes covering a broad general range of paranormal topics whereas Season two links more episodes together by homing in on a unified underlying cause that the government is trying to protect. Still though there is plenty of room for the separate paranormal episodes that are just as good as the unified ones (known as ""the mythology"" or ""mytharc"" episodes). Season two has a greater mix with much more original ideas than Season one did. It also boasts a lot of recognizable supporting actors you have seen in the movies. Season two of the X Files is mostly about - SETI projects and the Wow Signal, mutants, toxins, military experiments, sleep deprivation, alien abductions, vampires, NDEs (near death experiences), ancient life forms, alien human hybridization, ghosts, fetishes, the devil, Wicca, voodoo, alien bounty hunters, alien abduction of animals, rapid aging, circus freaks, demonic possession, viruses, dark matter and cannibalism. In Season two the episodes are more logical than Season one, less general weirdness, and more explanation, but still has some rough edges, and questionable moves by the main characters at times, but that is only cribbing. `The Anasazi' is the most popular show in Season Two and also the cliff-hanger last episode, but `Duane Barry' `Ascension' and `One Breath' are all classic episodes about Scully's abduction. `The Host' is a great monster story and `The Calusari' is very freaky. `Our Town' is downright horrific. In fact `The Calusari' caused the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) to give the whole Season box an 18 certificate (strictly for adults only) because of scenes involving children committing murder (the BBFC has banned these types of films before, so the UK was lucky to even get the 18 cert). The episode also had strong themes of child murder and violence towards children. There are a number of episodes that contain totally gross content that is hard to stomach. `3' could be the worst X-File episode of all time. It really stands out as a poor episode among the rest. The bottom line for The X Files: season two is that it is widely considered by fans to be the best season of them all. The last episode is a great way to finish off the season with lots of revelations and some more exposure of what the truth might be. There are quite a few `to be continued' double episodes in this season also. This season has 25 episodes!, the most any X Files season has to offer but as a note, watch out for the last episode ""The Anasazi"" which may not be on the last episode disc but is on the seventh bonus disc (the only episode on that disc)!

Season 3:
(*****/5)
Alien Black Oil
X Files: Season two, widely considered the best X Files season by fans, sent the show flying up the rankings with the season finishing in a cliff-hanger `to be continued' ending with the possibility that Mulder had been blown up by the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis). The first episode of X Files season three is also another `to be continued' which in the second episode results with Mulder and Scully back as a team with an X Files mandate directly instigated by Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund), the mysterious Mr X (Steven Williams) are also back. The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") is introduced. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) also makes a return. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) appears in a dream sequence and in a special effect. A lot of characters in the previous seasons episodes almost make surprise apperances towards the end. Between Season Two and the start of Season Three there is a whopping three-part X Files episode. The X Files is firmly reinstated at the FBI. The Cigarette-Smoking Man is having a hard time pleasing his bosses. There is lots of double-crossing. There is more history and revelation about Mulder's dad. However instead of making every other episode conspiracy orientated, Season Three decides to bulk the conspiracy right at the start and middle, with a little at the end for a low-intensity cliff-hanger, but leaves room for lots of sequential individual episodes with some that may actually be better than the mythology episodes, which is a change from Season Two that has better mythology ones. Season Three is less violent than Season Two and the hard-hitting action has been toned down (Scully doesn't get beaten-up as much this time). Season Three writers go back across the same grounds as Season One covering a broad general range of paranormal topics. Still though there is plenty of room for dealing with the unified underlying causes that the government is trying to protect and there is a greater revelation about a `date' for a threat that faces the Earth. Season Three also boasts a lot of recognizable supporting actors you have seen in the movies. It has also redone the opening theme. Season three of the X Files is mostly about - Majestic 12, human experiments, lightening, clairvoyance, reincarnation, fat-sucking vampires, phantom limbs, empathy, alien autopsies, stigmata, alien robots, astrology, gargoyles, alien black oil, willpower, shaman, organ theft, eye witness testimony, succubus, lake monsters, mind control and colonization. In Season three the episodes are much more logical, with very few episodes going for general weirdness, with more explanation and hardly any rough edges, with the characters doing more believable things. `Piper Maru' is the most popular show in Season Three because it contains our first images of the mysterious Alien Black Oil that became synonymous with the X Files. However the individual shows `Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose' about psychics, `Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'' about eye-witness testimony are great episodes and very memorable. So are `Quagmire' about lake monsters, `The Walk' about astral projecting serial killers, the `Nisei' about alien autopsies and the `Grotesque' about demons is scary. `Talitha Cumiare', the low-intensity cliff-hanger episode is an interesting mythology episode. Although not as gross as Season Two, all of the episodes are highly enjoyable. There are a lot more murder orientated stories so it feels a little bit like the other `Millennium' series that X Files creator Chris Carter produced. The X Files: Season Two it is widely considered by fans to be the best season of them all but Season Three can hold its own. There are quite a few `to be continued' double or triple episodes in this season.

Alien colonization or lies?
X Files: Season four follows in the steps of Season three, produces a virtually unstoppable series of great episodes, now that it has been firmly established as mainstream TV series viewing, finished with the `to be continued ending' of Mulder getting caught between a shape-shifter alien and a miracle-working alien battling it out, revealed that there is a possibility that the truth he is searching for has something to do with hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is back along with Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). The mysterious Mr X (Steven Williams) is here, but also introduces us to the new mystery deep throat type contact, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Back are `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund). The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") is here. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) has a surprise. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) even turns up again even though he has been dead for over three seasons. The X Files season four goes for the formula of giving us the conclusion to the previous season's cliffhanger but immediately spins right back into the individual episodes about various supernatural things that is more like season one, however this only lasts for half the season and the remaining half has some of the best X Files the series has had to offer so far. There is more mythology however there is lots of revelation to suggest that the X Files is being misled to believe that Aliens exist. This season also boasts a lot of recognizable supporting actors you have seen in the movies. Season four of the X Files is mostly about - alien colonization, inbreeding, mutant albinos, past lives, demonic surgery, the cigarette smoking man's past, serial killers, deadly cargo, El Chupacabra, Jewish mysticism, deadly tattoos, resurrection, dying, stealth assassins, UFO crashes, time travel, reproducing shape shifters, Skinner's crime, mind control and aliens in the ice.  Episodes ``Tempus Fugit' Unrequited', `Tunguska', `Synchrony' stand out the most but the best episode is Skinner's cover-up of a crime in the episode `Zero Sum'. Ending sets the scene for Season five.

Season 5
(*****/5)
The Critically Acclaimed Season V (This season goes Widescreen)
X Files: Season five follows in the steps of Season two, produces a virtually unstoppable series of great episodes, now that it has been firmly established as mainstream TV series viewing. Although the `to be continued ending' of Season four is not the best beginnings to a season, and the first few episodes are a bit dodgy, this is all forgiven when the screenwriters decide to go back and follow in the steps of Season 2's acclaim. There is a crazy role reversal. Mulder believes that the hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth is a con to detract from what is simply a series of government experiments on the citizens of planet Earth and the alien agenda just subterfuge. Scully however is absolutely convinced that Mulder was right all long and so takes the lead role as the paranormal investigator while Mulder turns sceptic. This character switch works wonders and kudos to the screenwriters for doing it. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is dead as is Mr X (Steven Williams), however packs of Morleys turn up from time to time. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is more aware that something paranormal is going on and even sides with Scully when Mulder lambastes both for being delusional. Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden) has a secret. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back and even have their own private episode of how they came to be together. The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") is back and Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) has another surprise in store. Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) is gone, long since dead, however Section Chief Scott Blevins (Charles Cioffi) from Season 1 (and a bit of Season 4) is back for a very important double episode. There is also the introduction of Special Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) who also plays a significant role. Robert Modell (Robert Wisden) from Season Two's Pusher is back.

The X Files season five is some of the best X Files to date. More mythology and more major revelations, means that you will be hooked from disc 2 onwards, right to the staggering finale. There are also a few supporting actors you have seen in movies. And yes, thankfully after 3 seasons of Scully's overrun cancer suffering, this is about to come to an end. Season five of the X Files is mostly about - pre-X files back stories, Scully's cancer, mothman, mystery offspring, Frankenstein, Modell the pusher, psychotherapy, witchcraft, AI, vampires, extraterrestrial wars, hoasting alien experiments, blind psychics, Angels and Demons, government toxins, monsters and ESP. Episodes ""Kitsunegari"", ""Kill Switch"", ""Bad Blood"" and ""All Souls"" stand out as great non-conspiracy episodes, but the final episode is one of the best mythology episodes to date. The best episode is ""Folie  Deux"" which has a terrific monster story and some really mad special effects for a television episode. Season 5 is all top stuff.

NOTE: Remember before moving onto Season 6, you are supposed to watch X Files the movie first (sold separately to the box set).

Season 6:
(*****/5)
Picking up where the Movie left off... and this season has Bruce Campbell!
X Files: Season six has Mulder reconstructing a private X Files after the destruction of his affairs at the end of Season five. This is very much a mythological alien invasion packed season. Mulder is back and believing that the hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth is not a con but a real threat and no longer sees it as just being a government propaganda vehicle. Scully is back to her critical ways. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) shows up again. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is here for more of his director of FBI lecturing the bizarre duo.  `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) makes a return. Special Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) has more screentime who alongside Agent Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) have been assigned the X Files which they ignore and censor. Apart from the main theme of an alien conspiracy the single episodes stand out as some of the funniest of the X Files seasons. Season six of the X Files is mostly about - Alien hegemony, sonic death, time travel, altered states, demons, weather, ghosts, photography, poisons, astral projections, leviathans, killer dogs, fantasies, the lone gunmen, baseball playing aliens, hallucinogens and alien artefacts. The episodes are so good it is hard to pick out the best of the lot. The episode ""Rain Man"" is absolutely hilarious. ""Terms of Endearment"" features Bruce Campbell who is excellent in everything and it is a pity they didn't keep his character on for more. ""Tithonus"", about a crime scene photographer, is quite creepy. ""SR 819"" is like the movie DOA featuring Skinner dying from a mystery illness. ""Arcadia"" is about a strict neighbourhood that hides a secret monstrosity. ""Agua Mala"" is one of the best monster hunting episodes to date. ""The Unnatural"" is the classic episode where a baseball player is really an alien. Season 6 is worth every penny. If you thought the X Files couldn't get better then this one puts the X back in the files.

Season 7:
(*****/5)
The Mulder Abduction (where David Duchovny leaves the show)
X Files: Season seven is full of Special Agent Mulder but effectively he leaves the X Files at the end of this season only to make guest star appearances in the next two seasons, so this is the last season to see Mulder full-time. Season seven begins with Mulder facing a problem of an extraterrestrial telepathy that threatens his life. Scully is off trying to discover the meaning of life in terms of new facts that have presented themselves in religion and biology. A whole pile of questions concerning the alien agenda are answered in the first few episodes and what happened to Mulder's sister. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is back along with Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) make a few shows. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) makes a return. Special Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) is dead as is Agent Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Season six of the X Files is mostly about - Alien hegemony, telepathy, mutants, luck, Millennium's Frank Black, speed, demons, magicians, Christian snake handling, Mulder's sister, reality TV, computer games, celtic voodoo, a cure for cancer, wild women, love, Hollywood, tobacoo, fighting, genies and Mulder's abduction. This Season changes to try and provide a new type of humour halfway through and so the style varies along with the X files / Cops hybrid show and the mixing in of Millennium (You may want to see all of Millennium before you watch this Season as it ended before Season 7). Season 7 has a lot to offer. Of course it really all hinges on the two episodes `Closer' about Mulder's Sister and Mulder's finale in `Requiem'. Season 7 is probably the oddest of the traditional Seasons (1-7) because of the pace changes and David Duchovny resigning himself for only guest star roles in the last two Seasons (apparently he wanted to do other things like film). It is sad to think that this is the end to Spooky and we have enjoyed being with him now for a run of 7 Seasons which lasted 7 years.

Note: effectively this season is the end of the X Files for many fans. Duchovny is practically gone and the producers reduce Scully's role. Instead they try to lead the show with Dogget and Reyes who appear in Season 8 and 9 which happen to be also the worst seasons of the X Files. There are only a handful of good episodes (could even fit on 2 discs) and Season 9 doesn't even contain a deserved wrap up of the traditional Mulder/Scully storyline and even ends with a cliff-hanger. The much tooted `the truth' double episode ending in Season 9 doesn't contain anything new you haven't learned already. You may just as well stop here.

Season 8:
(***/5)
They are replacing Mulder and Scully with Dogget and Reyes,
X Files: Season eight is the one where Mulder leaves the show (in order to pursue a career in film) only to appear part time. You may even be in for Mulder's death. The show begins with a brand new introductory credit sequence which actually looks very good and there are two versions, one containing Mulder leading and one without Mulder with Scully leading. This way you know if Mulder will make an appearance or not. The new agent Dogget (Robert Patrick) is set to replace Mulder as Scully's partner. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is gone from the show. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) has more of a lead role. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back as is Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is also a brand new addition. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) is really playing the bad guy this season along with the new mysterious insider Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin).

Season eight of the X Files is mostly about - Agent Dogget, Gibson Praise, time travel, monster bats, religious cults, ghosts, drugs, alien pregnancy, x-ray vision, metal man, pain, Indian mystics, viruses, Mulder, alien black oil, Doggett's son, alien colonisation, mutants and Scully's child. Dogget is essentially the new sceptic so he and Scully have a lot of fun in the single episodes. Also thankfully Season eight completely omits the slapstick humour change that Season seven tried out towards the end.

The major problem however is not with this season but what the producers are hiding from us. You don't see this until season nine. Essentially Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is here to replace Scully. Yeah the producers are going to be moving in the direction of Special Agent Monica Reyes and Agent Dogget leading the X Files for Season nine and possibly more. However Season nine killed the X Files. It is easy to give this series 4 to 5 stars without knowing what the producers are planning (I originally gave it 5) but when you know the truth! you can easily dock down. So Mulder essentially did leave the show in season 7 and Scully is leading for the time being but doing bit parts in season nine

Season 9:
(*/5)
Deceptive and misleading train wreck with little Scully and practically zero Mulder
X Files: Season 9 is a problem. The way to solve this problem is easy. Stop with Season 7. If you enjoy watching good TV seasons then stop at 7. If you are an X Files fan and want to complete things then fine but you know what is happening and if not here goes. Duchovny has left the show but appears for only a few episodes between Seasons 8 and 9 and when he does turn up it's not worth it. Now we know that Dogget is the Mulder replacement, but what Season 8 didn't tell you was that Reyes was the Scully replacement. So Season 9 is mostly Dogget and Reyes investigating something. The stories are all mostly terrible and a chore to sit through. It is like the writers and producers have lost all heart. In fact X Files Season 8 should never have been called the X Files. A better title for this would be Dogget and Reyes Season 2.

The show develops the new introductory credit sequence. There are a few versions, one containing Mulder leading and one without Mulder with Scully leading. Some have Skinner, others don't. It is mostly Scully, Dogget and Reyes but looks can be deceiving... and they are because Scully is in like 5% of the show if she is in the credits.

So Agent Dogget (Robert Patrick) replaces Mulder. Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) practically replaces Scully. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) leaves his lead role from Season 8 and virtually vanishes from this Season. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back for one or two episodes. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) isn't really heard of. Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin) has a episode or two but make no mistake about it, this is all Dogget and Reyes.

Season 9 of the X Files is mostly about - water, satanic murders, skinning, serial killers, flies, Mexico, looking for Mulder, more serial killers, crashed saucers, kid's imaginations, near death experiences, numerology, the Lone Gunmen, profiling, disfigurement, psychokinesis and finally... the truth .

Season 9 is bad. I cannot see how anyone who has sat through the amazing stories that were Seasons 1 to 7 could like, let alone recommend, it. What is there good to say about it? Duchovny was the X Files. They don't even try to tie loose ends up. Even the double episode `The truth' doesn't reveal anything you haven't already heard before and ends in a cliff-hanger that has never been answered and probably never will. The producers are trying to sell us a different show under the banner of the X Files and didn't even have the courtesy to give us a decent Mulder/Scully ending. To top it off the episodes are a slog to get through and lots of them will insult your intelligence. This isn't just a bad season of the X Files... this is a catastrophe that many wish they never sat through, including me. It may well be the worst TV season for any series that I own. I think anyone who throws out boxes 8 and 9 from their X Files collection is rightly justified in doing so.

However the traditional X Files seasons 1 to 7 are excellent shows and is one of the reasons why the X Files manages to get into the Top 10 TV series of all time. Having this collection is worth every penny and you will watch it over and over again. It is an amazing journey and one well worth taking.

Pros:
- One of the best TV series of all time.
- Huge story arcs throughout the seasons.
- The dialogue and classic Mulder one-liners.
- Repeated viewing

Cons:
- You might be able to get Seasons 1 - 7 cheaper than the whole collection boxed.
- No remastering.
- Seasons 8 and 9 are terrible.",1220918400,28,30587,4.896970866293652
2193559,5,B0006SH25C,"This is a must have for any X-phile. If your heart is telling you to buy it, do it. All nine seasons and the movie. And every featurette you could hope for. It's all here. If you have a craving for any episode, and time of the day, you've got it. What could be better than that?

What they say about the box is true - it was broken when it was delivered. But that wasn't Amazon's fault. The DVDs are just too heavy for the box to hold. I just ripped out the inner pannel and it works fine now.

It's a bit pricey. But if you love this show... and if you do, you know what I mean... you'll want to own it. It beats all my old VHS tapes.",1219795200,4,635,3.803030303030303

Anyway, now that I am out of graduate school and have had time to watch shows, reruns in particular, I have found that the X-Files is one classy show and that the episode mentioned above was a rarity (thank God for it still scares me).  I purchased this set after watching about a season of reruns for I knew it appealed to my sci-fi and action escapism needs.  I am sooooo happy with this set and its associated items, especially the listing of shows which has helped me find my favorites fast.  I watched the entire set in about a week or so - religiously obviously!  And now with the new movie out, I am about to rewatch the series again.  Even with the DVD set, I still catch episodes on SciFi or TNT channels when I can.  Too much fun.  This set is appealing in every way and for those that enjoy this genre, it is a purchase that highly recommended by me and many others.  Definitely a classic show that will last many decades to come.",1218931200,3,1220,4.3628318584070795

I have yet to see the most recent film ""I Want to Believe"" (2008) but I really want to, despite the negative reviews it received.

I am still wanting all seasons and film(s) on DVD, but the Fox keeps re-releasing them.  I suppose this is a money making ruse.  Yet the cost of all nine season set is $809.99?  I don't get it.  What do I get for this price?  I hope characters come to life once the disc is put in the player.  In all honesty, the X-Files were one of the best shows on television, but not at this price.",1217808000,8,665,4.093023255813954

Although I felt like they should have included the brief Lone Gunmen series to make it truly the ""complete collector's edition."" Of course with the new movie it should be the nearly complete collectors edition. Maybe the new movie will fit in the drawer?

It arrived today and I'm very excited. I'm watching the Pilot episode right now.

What comes in the box is all 9 seasons + the flight to the future movie. It came with about 10 collector cards, a flight-to the future movie poster, a small comic, and a book that gives a one sentence description of every show in every season...plus a offers a small photo beside the description. In stead of actual DVD cases the disks comes in small flip-book size holder so they can be easily removed.

This series was unlike any other show on television and it's appeal is almost universal even if you don't like Sci-Fi.

The drawer is a real betch too, you have to hold it sideways to slide the material out. The discs are held in VERY bad packaging. It's just as bad as There Will Be Blood, it'll take a LONG time tog et one disc out since it's tucked in to the paper very tightly. It looks easy to get out, it is not.

2193580,5,B0006SH25C,"My job required constant international travel, so I missed most of the X Files and other TV shows during their heyday.

I became a TNT X FILES on Monday night junkie. Actually, the shows began on Tuesdays at one AM and went until five, and also usually ran on one more early morning per week, plus fill ins.

When TNT scheduling changed and it appeared that the X Files were not going to be a regular part of the line up, I found this on AMAZON and was amazed at the price break and FREE SHIPPING, NO TAX savings.

but the product.  before i bought it, i read a ton of reviews talking about how the drawer on the bottom gets smooshed by the main compartment above it collapsing on to it... i think they've corrected it.  The drawer had a nice brace inside it to keep the top compartment from collapsing...  and in general i feel the construction of the box is sturdy enough for a gift set type product.  For example, my Seinfeld gift set is not really any better... meaning that they're both good.

So, the XFiles set looks great and is convienient.  I love the little books for each season.

My only concern is that the way the CD's are placed in the books.... i haven't had an scratches yet, but the paper sleeve is kind of precharious... but i'll be careful.

2193594,4,B0006SH25C,"I just purchased this set from Amazon for the great low price of $164.99.  I've never seen it cheaper in any brick and mortar store - and besides, how can you beat the free shipping and no tax?

I was a bit reluctant to pull the trigger at first.  I was a die-hard X-Files fan for the first several years that the season was on television.  I began to lose interest during the Doggett years and never finished watching the series.  I questioned whether or not I could still have interest in this series after so many years of not watching it.  Let me tell you - it was a really great purchase.  I've told my husband several times over the past few days how glad I am to have made the commitment.

My package arrived fairly quickly - within 5 calendar days.  The box that it was shipped in was pretty much trashed, and not much packing inside.  The box set itself was unscathed, though.  I was careful to remove the shrink wrap so as to not hurt the box.  Like most other reviewers, I had problems getting the ""goody drawer"" open.  Each season comes in it's own ""flip book"", with each individual DVD taking up a page and sliding into sleeve of cardboard which leaves the top half of each disc exposed for easy removal.  Since there are nine seasons, there are nine flip books, plus one skinnier flip book for the movie.

The first thing I did was remove each flip book from the box and then tried to pull open the goody drawer.  Even with the weight of the flip books gone, the drawer was still very difficult to open.  I finally did get it open, and reviewed everything inside.  It came with a very nice episode guide book, a comic book, a movie poster and several art cards - the same type that were found in the VHS box sets.  I decided to put all the goodies back in the drawer and just leave it closed.

The flip books are so nice that I have decided to display them individually in my DVD storage rack.  This way, I can access them easily without having to pull out the whole box to get to them.

As with other reviewers, I was concerned about the cardboard sleeve pages of the flip books.  These pages caused some scratching on several discs.  Instead of contacting Amazon about this, I have decided to watch the discs to see if I have any trouble playing them.  So far, disc 2 of the first season seems to be scratched the worst (visually), but it has played wonderfully.  I would suspect that most sets have some scratched discs, and trying to return the set will only get you another scratched set.  My advice would be to check all of your discs when you get the set, and try out the ones that you feel might cause you problems.

I would have given the set 5 stars, but due to the goody drawer functionality (or lack there of) and the scratching of some discs, I give it 4 stars.  The series itself deserves 5 stars.

If you're wondering whether or not to buy this set (like I did), and you're willing to deal with the minor imperfections, it's truly a must have.  I don't regret buying it for one second.  The X-Files is truly a classic show and I'm so glad that I purchased this set.",1206835200,5,3094,4.262886597938144

2193598,5,B0006SH25C,"Finally! The X-Files arrives on Blu-ray - completely remastered in HD resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio! I have to say, having owned them on DVD, watching them on Blu-ray is almost like viewing the series again for the first time. They looks SPECTACULAR.

It should be known that the DVD releases of Seasons 1-4 were in 4:3 aspect ratio, and Seasons 5-9 were in wide screen. So it is very nice to have all seasons in 16:9 this time around, with crystal clear picture. The series was shot with BOTH 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios in mind, knowing that the eventuality would be to broadcast the series in HD format. So which ever way you view the show, it is exactly what the creators intended, and is not zoomed in and cropped for wide screen like some other shows have done. It is simply one of two ways the show was intended to look. Personally, I'd take the 16:9 format over 4:3 ANY day.

I'll admit, the set does have a few faults. While the previous DVD collection (see previous review below) included the first movie, this set does not. It also does not contain the second film, ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe."" The outer box of the Blu-ray collection is pretty flimsy, and mine arrived with some dents, which is unfortunate. But on the PLUS side, every season is in much better Blu-ray plastic packaging, which is a huge upgrade from the packaging of the DVD collector's set, which was all cardboard with the discs inserted into slits. You don't have to worry about the Blu-ray packaging scratching your discs, and Blu-rays are much more scratch-resistant anyway.

For special features, the Blu-rays include everything from the old DVD collection, along with intros for eight random episodes. These were originally released on The X-Files Revelations DVD set, which was sort of a promotional set released just before the second film hit theaters in 2008. All other special features were on the previous DVD sets as far as I can tell, including the features from The X-Files Mythology sets. If you have never seen any of the special features before, they are quite extensive and worth watching!

In short, this set is a great buy, even for those who already have the DVD sets. Believe me, the episodes have never looked better, and seeing them in wide screen is quite a treat. I adore this set!

Below is my original review from the DVD collector's set...
----

I originally bought all nine seasons of The X-Files on DVD when they were first released as individual sets (not the slim-packs or the mythology sets) in those flimsy packages where sometimes the outer slip case wouldn't slide over the inside box properly. I shelled out at least $80-100 per set. I believe they were so highly priced because they were one of the first TV shows ever to be presented on DVD. They may have even been the first.

Anyhow, when I saw this ultimate collection, it made me a little mad, as it has every single disc from the original sets that I bought, including all the bonus features. It also includes the movie, and the ""Threads of the Mythology"" features that were on the Mythology sets. Lastly, it includes a complete season guide, a comic book, trading cards and an X-Files movie poster!

This is a collection that typically sells for $329.00, and is now selling on Amazon for $165.00! I couldn't pass it up. I just have to accept that now I'll never get all the money back that I spent on the original poorly packaged sets, and be content with making back at least some of the money I spent on this Ultimate Collector's Set when I sell my original sets somewhere.

I will say, however, that the drawer that other reviewers have had problems with works fine for me. If it doesn't simply slip out, I just tilt the box back a bit so that the weight of the discs isn't sitting directly on the drawer and then the drawer pops out just fine.

My box did receive some wear and tear on it on one of the corners on the inside, and I think it was like that even before it shipped, as it was covered by the outer shell of the collector's box and that had no damage at all. This seems to have been an issue for past buyers off of Amazon.

Anyhow, if you previously bought any X-Files box sets in the past, just sell them somewhere and buy this. It is really a steal!",1206057600,3,4250,4.492227979274611
2193599,4,B0006SH25C,this is obviously one the alltime great tv series and you really get a lot for your money. the only thing preventing me from giving this a 5 star rating is the poor design of the product. the drawer is a PITA to open because of the weight of all the dvd's sitting on top of the drawer. the inside of the box that houses the dvd's is torn from being cheaply made and not strong enough. you have to take all the dvd's out to open the drawer which contains all the extras.,1205539200,,469,4.0

The box itself is brilliantly conceived, providing a pull out drawer below the DVD compartment to store the collectors book, however mine was damaged in shipping - the weight of the dvds (which are above the drawer) broke down into the pull out drawer compartment, making it necessary for me to glue the base of the DVD's container back securely into the box in order to allow the drawer to pull in and out again.

The DVDs are of great quality and the case they come in is strong and built to last.  One little glitch is the drawer that pulls out to get to the episode guide.

As stated in so many other reviews, the box that the set comes in will have problems with the drawer.  This, however, appears to be due to an inferior design and nothing that Amazon.com or the USPS has done.

The pros:

It is exactly what it claims to be.  The packaging of the individual seasons is very nice, and the episode guide is very nice.

There really isn't much more to say.  If you are a X-Files fan and want th entire series, this is the way to go.  All of the material for a fraction of the cost.  And if all that is wrong is a little drawer...

I never bought any of them though, $80 a season was a little steep (much to my husband's dismay).  Then, the slim sets started coming out and I was excited and that is what I originally intended to buy, until I saw this beautiful box set!!!  I purchased this during an amazon promotional sale on TV shows, etc...so I got this box set for about half price, HOW COULD I PASS IT UP!!!

This includes all 201 episodes of the X-files, packaged really well in my opinion, with the exception of I hate sliding DVDs into pockets of any sort...it scuffs the disc, and the seasonal folders are a series of cardboard pockets.  My husband has relocated all of the DVDs into round slim cases that he thinks will still fit into the box, which leaves him free to use the original season boxes to use as decor.

This set also includes the movie along with tons of deleted scenes, featurettes, etc...It is just wonderful!!!  The picture quality and everything is perfect and appears that everything is in order.  There is a book with a listing for every episode, which is an excellent reference if you're the type that is constantly strapped for time but can't stop watching...you can always check to see if you're getting into a 2-parter episode which is really helpful...I have a hard time walking away in the middle of a story.

This set has all 9 seasons and it's size and weight are substantial, make special room for this on your shelf as it will dominate your DVD collection, it also has a complete episode guide to go along with your wonderful disc sets. Some have stated some packaging issues and damage with shipping but most venders now have solved that problem with some creative packaging and delivery, so don't fear. If you want to believe then go ahead, now with this set the truth is REALLY out there and you can have it today in one big package, it won't last forever.",1202428800,,1160,4.663414634146341

When they first started being released, the price per season was more then my X Files obsessed mind could deal with. I waited five years for a cheaper way to buy The X Files on DVD so I could get rid of my VHS collection, and here it is! I am glad I bought it last week when it was 50% off now that I see the price went back up again! If you have been waiting for the perfect time to buy, I would buy now. With the movie coming out this summer, I imagine the price will go up some more.

The packaging is wonderful for me. I know there has been some comments about it's design, but I have found nothing wrong with it. To have such a rich show given to you in one case is a godsend. Much better then buying all of the original season's one at a time in their big box sets! Saves room in your entertainment center too!

The extra material is wonderful to watch! The only thing I found missing are the gag reels! :) But you can find those online.

If you've been waiting, you should buy it now! What a difference a week makes in pricing!

P.S. - The only downside was when I watched ""Patient X"" and ""The Red and The Black"" last night, I was reminded of how much of a jerk Mulder was during those episodes. But he ended on a good note! :-)

2193634,1,B0006SH25C,"The last two seasons of The X-Files are nothing short of heartbreaking, cowardly, traitorous, and completely myopic in my opinion, and I'm quite sure in the opinions of many others who were loyal fans of this series for 9 long years. In an attempt to make an extra buck, Chris Carter and his corporate goonba accomplices sacrificed content and continuity for series longevity, and in the end succeeded in tarnishing a one-of-a-kind program.

I would love to know what kind of rationale was in play when those in charge decided to kill off some of the most important characters, thereby severing story lines, plots, and important character interdependencies that had been cultivated from the beginning. The Lone Gunmen, C.G.B. Spender (Cigarette Smoking Man), Krycek, and The Syndicate (to name a few) formed an impossible-to-replace group of characters, and I lost all respect for the show when these characters were eliminated and nothing of substance was created to take their place.

Carter should have called it quits when Duchovny left, but no. What we have instead are two additional seasons that are total monstrosities and an insult to viewers who placed emotional stock in this show and its characters. Carter obviously had zero loyalty to the program's fans, otherwise he would never have made such a callous decision to ruin this show's legacy by tampering so radically with the storyline. What was left after the deed was done? Absolutely nothing.

The series finale was perhaps the biggest disappointment in programming history. From the very first episode, the series revolved around an extraterrestrial storyline, and what did we get at the end and in return for all of our years of loyal viewing? We get Mulder and Scully sitting in a hotel room, reminiscing about old times, not knowing where to go or what to do next. And to top it all off, Carter always promised he would never entangle Mulder and Scully in any type of sexual intrigue, and what did he do during the last two seasons? You guessed it.

It's been a long time since this series went off the air, but the greed and selfishness surrounding the production of the last two seasons, and in particular the last season, still resonates because this series did mean alot to so many people, myself included. Chris Carter is set for life, but he has lost my respect. He and his retinue's opportunism makes me sick....",1199491200,19,2390,4.893827160493827

The cardboard separator isn't strong enough to hold the weight of the dvd's and it rests on the drawer. So, you can't open it and is worthless as a storage drawer.

It is poorly conceived, and even more poorly executed. The drawer holding the printed material is jammed and split, and the interior of the box that holds the DVD's is ripped all along one side. All of this was undetectable when the product was received, as the box comes factory shrinkwrapped, and the drawer is covered by a fold-over front flap. Other reviewers have clearly had the same issues, which, as has been said, are unacceptable for a set costing as much as this one does.

In respect of the price, I paid $230 before Christmas, only to find that it is now $165! I appreciate Amazon agreeing to replace the set for me due to the damage, but the price drop does rankle somewhat.

 The box set seems fine to me and any problems people mentioned in earlier posts seem to have been addressed. The section the DVDs rests on is now thick cardboard. Apparently earlier sets had only thin paper there. I am sure anyone who has that problem can easily solve it with some cardboard and elmers glue. It stinks when things come damaged but sometimes a home remedy fix it can be very satisfying.

To save myself grief everytime I wanted to look at the episode guide, I decided to leave the drawer out and just keep the printed materials in the slot without it. Yes, the box should have been built sturdier, but it doesn't ruin my enjoyment of the set.

Except for the drawer problem, I like the packaging. Each season comes in a different colored compact book and you can access the disks easily (so much better than the clunky original season 1 packaging which had endless flaps to open to get to each disk).

Negatives:
the box they live in comes dented and the drawer that is on the bottom can't be pulled out.  I had to use a knife to retrieve the episode guide and other information that was stored in the drawer.  This isn't a big deal, but the design of this is just really dumb.

The other thing that I don't care for is the way the DVDs are organized.  They aren't in a traditional DVD case; they are smaller and thicker and therefore can not be stored with my other DVD's.  They have to be kept in the dumb box otherwise the disks will slip out of their envelopes.

Positives:

2193649,5,B0006SH25C,"I was one of the few who held out on buying the individual seasonal box sets, mostly due to the price. After I'd placed an order for the first season slim set, I found out this complete collector's edition was coming out and, for the price, I couldn't refuse.

Here's how it went:

The box arrived this morning via DHL Next Day service, and the shipping box was opened when it arrived, although the tape hadn't been broken. The DHL delivery man suggested I inspect the package before he left to ensure there weren't any problems, and indeed the actual product was not damaged. I was relieved.

The product itself has a flip open cover which is magnetically sealed to the base. To open it, you flip the cover up and then fold it back behind the box, which reveals the DVDs. This cover came unglued almost immediately, however I suspect that is due to being in the cold in the back of the delivery truck for so long (I live in Wisconsin, and it hasn't been much warmer than the mid-40's for quite some time). The box is still structurally sound, and is not falling apart by any means, it's just that the cover folds ALL the way back now, instead of just partially. I suspect I'll be able to reglue this on my own.

The individual sets are NOT in slim cases, like the slim set re-releases are. They are in cardboard containers, like little booklets, with 2 DVDs to each ""page"". They are held in place by cardboard ""sleeves"". Unfortunately, I have noticed that some of the disks are scratched, though the scratches are small and about the width of a human hair. I have not yet encountered any difficulties with playback, however I am only on the third disk of the second season yet, and this was the first one I noticed to have any damage whatever.

One of the cardboard containers, the last one housing the 9th season set of DVDs, came unglued from its housing, however I would also attribute this to being in the cold for so long. I am also confidant I can fix this myself.

There is a drawer set into the base of the box, just above the magnet, which holds the episode guide booklet, a series of cards relating to first season, the comic book, and the poster, which is of the X-Files movie.

So far, I have absolutely NO complaints about the box, despite the damage. I've heard of similar problems with the Alias box set and some others, but I do not think this should dissuade anyone from purchasing it. As I said, I have not yet encountered any problems with playback, and none of the disks I have yet inspected have had any damage more severe than you would find on the average rental DVD.

My advice? If you can afford it, pay for the 1-day shipping. This way, you ensure your box is handled by fewer people, and thus it should arrive in better condition.

Again, I highly recommend this product to any fan of the series who has not yet purchased the individual sets. This is what you've been waiting for. If you're worried about the quality of the box, remember that Amazon has an exemplary product return system. Don't miss out on this.",1194480000,16,3041,4.416071428571429

However, if you don't have them, this is a great price for all of them.  You're basically getting the entire series for around half price as opposed to buying each set individually.
Also, I'm guessing the reason Fox released this set now was to produce revenue for the new X-Files 2 movie which starts filming in December, which of course, I can't wait to see. :) I'll eventually end up picking this box set up when I get the cash together.
I currently have the Mythology collection which is not ""pointless"" as other people have stated.  However, if you have this box set, you obviously don't really need the Mythology collection as long as you know which episodes are part of the mythology.",1194048000,6,881,4.598726114649682

Only the first Act from the very first episode 'Hot Snow' survives but this offers a tantalisingly bried introduction to the series.

Following on from this, 'Girl on the Trapeze' showcases the characters Dr Keel and his 'Avengers' girl, secretary Carol Wilson in a fantastic episode that is full of tense situations and twists and turns and is an amazing episode that leaves the viewer wanting to see more of these early Avengers regulars.

The final Season One episode still in existence is 'The Frighteners' in which Dr Keel,Steed and Carol join forces to bring down an illegal activity involving three men who physically beat and threaten people for financial gains, however there is more to the story than just that....

The Emma Peel related stuff, although not my most favourite era of the show, is interesting. The black and white American introduction is 30 seconds of fun. The 3 minute advertisement for the 1967 colour series is interesting and great for completist. The addtion of a New Avengers episode seems quite odd though and a waste of time as it is the first part of a two part story and brief cameo appearances by Emma total about 10-15 seconds only.

The documentary is excellent, only a shame it wasn't in depth a bit more but great to hear the main regulars talking about their time on the show.

However once I heard the announcement of a complete set of the originals plus the movie and extras from the mythology sets I decided to forego buying the other slim pack sets and just buying the complete collection. The set has each of the nine seasons, the Fight the Future, and the threads of mythology disc with four featurettes. Each actual season comes with the bonus features that were released on the original X-Files sets which include deleted scenes, tv spots, commentaries, documentaries, and more for each specific season.

I say that if you are a huge fan of X-Files or want to complete your X-Files collection this is a must buy.",1187654400,283,952,4.567251461988304

2193658,4,B0006SH25C,"I found this DVD very intriguing because it allows the viewer to see the evolution of the show.

My favorite duo is John Steed and Emma Peel and was a little disappointed that there was just a small interview segment with Lady Rigg back to what seems to be the eighties. I would love to see her in a current lengthy interview explaining the show and maybe taking questions from an audience panel. However, this show has not been part of her life for many years and she is more engaged in the theater.

Anyway, I love this DVD because it covers the whole spectrum of the show from the early episodes to the very last series with Ms. Lumley. It definitely is a must for the collector.",1173657600,,682,4.3203125

2193661,5,B0006SH25C,"Does it get any better than the X-Files? Each episode is packed with more thrills, chills and strange turns of events than most blockbuster films you shell out ten bucks to see. The X-Files has the advantage of a team of writers committed to creating stories based loosely in fact and incorporating frequently from the pages of history.

Political cover-ups, mind control, and reports of extraterrestrial contact an elite team of government officials is quick to stifle. None of this can be relegated to the annals of science fiction. Only a victim of memory altering experiments will suggest that the government is open and honest about its science and its knowledge of the strange and alien that Fox Mulder is so passionate about.

The X-Files succeeds because most of us believe that certain events and discoveries have been quickly concealed for the so-called good of the population. Some of us are more extreme than others. True conspiracy fanatics have come to regard the X-Files creators as harbingers of the truth, cleverly doling out information through pop television.

Most, though, simply enjoy the brilliance of each episode, as our hero Mulder, with his linear, skeptical and yet strangely sexy sidekick, Scully, uncover more phenomenon than most Hollywood producers could dream of in a lifetime.

Mulder is a loveable FBI agent in spite of his almost manic drive to uncover the truth, the product of a childhood experience that haunts him. Scully is like the sister you just want to shake and douse with water as she doubts what she sees even as ghoulish things slither from sewers in front of her.

The beauty of this show is that it doesn't rely on any one thing. The conspiracy theme can stand on its own because it is steeped in truth and it is apparent that the writers believe. The story lines are fascinating and often disturbing, whether you believe that such strangeness exists or not. The regular characters (you will love and hate the shady and infinitely powerful ""smoking man"" if you have not already met him) are joined each episode by new and dynamic players created by brilliant minds.

I received the entire X-Files collection as a gift and it is a durable one. I have almost gone through them one by one and, I suspect, I will one day do it all again. Because the truth is out there, my friends. And I'd like to be among the chosen one when THEY finally come for us.",1146009600,2,2399,4.7548076923076925
2193662,5,B0006SH25C,"I just wanted to to say that i do agree with the price of this set being WAY too high.  But there is 1 thing people are not concidering.  amazon sells 2 versions of each season the cheaper $40 ones are not the boxed sets you see here.  but then again are the original boxed sets worth that much more?  who realy watches 50 hours worth of bonus material anyway?  Personaly id rather pay the 40 bucks to just get the re-released sets that just have the episodes.  i don't need to pay double for features i don't even watch.  as far a the show itself goes, it is by far the best series i've ever seen.  and instead of going on for 2 hrs saying why ill just leave it at that.",1144800000,,671,3.992481203007519
2193663,5,B0006SH25C,"The X-Files is one of the best show that's been on television, in fact it has been brilliant, up until the last couple of seasons. When Mulder began dissappearing in the early part of season 8, the quality of the show began to fade away along with him.

To me the essence of The X-Files is the combination of Scully and Mulder working together to solve the mysteries of the unknown, and without that team work, there isn't a show worth watching. They had a unique balance between each other that consisted of mutual respect of each other's differences and a great friendship that helped them overcome all the odds they faced over the series' 9 seasons run.

The subtle and quirky humor Mulder had was one of many things that made the show so excellent, and the yin and yang like qualities that were seen in both Mulder and Scully perfectly complemented each other and created a dynamic relationship that forever changed the face of television, not to mention the tremendous character development seen as both grew older and wiser.  It was very interesting to see how their platonic love evolved over the years to become a romantic, deep and transcendental love.

The show's cast over the years was excellent, with such unforgettable characters as Alex Krycek, the Cigarette Smoking Man CGB Spender, Assistant FBI director Walter Skinner and the list goes on.  Despite numerous continuity problems with some of the characters, especially regarding Mulder's sister and the arching storyline of the government-alien conspiracy, the show remained intriguing and enchanting.

All that changed once John Dogget and Monica Reyes replaced Mulder as the show's other half, and although they've proven themselves as good actors, nobody can make up for the loss of the series' main character. It would be like watching Seinfeld without Seinfeld, or Star Wars without Luke Skywalker, in other words there is virtually no show without either character, because the series is based on that central character, or combination of characters.

I knew 'The X-Files would not last without Fox Mulder, and that the ratings would bottom out, and they did, which led to the show's cancellation. Even though I will greatly miss The X-Files, I was glad to see it end on a good note (Mulder returns in the final episode) rather than to have it drag out into obscureness with characters that have really nothing to do with what 'The X-Files' was all about, such as the super-soldiers sub-plot.  The heart of the show was Mulder, with the aid of Scully, figuring out the far-reaching conspiracy while solving the occult and unexplained.

Even the last two seasons which were the weakest are still far better than most TV series, past and present.  I have bought each season of The X-Files on DVD, a series this great is worth owning forever, and I know there will never be a series quite like it, nor as good.  This is the TV collection to own, no doubt about it.",1142640000,4,2935,4.826693227091633
2193664,5,B0006SH25C,"A&E Home Video get closer to the completion of The Avengers on DVD with the release of this very special disc, available as part of the Emma Peel Mega-Set or as a stand alone disc. It may only appeal to real Avengers fanatics, but in itself it also provides a very key example of early television drama - a far cry from the stuff modern TV is made of indeed.

I am not entirely sure why this disc is part of the Emma Peel box set or indeed why the adorable Dame Diana Rigg appears on the disc sleeve. This disc is really a tribute to the earliest era of The Avengers, when the series mainstay, John Steed played so admirably by Patrick MacNee, was in fact the secondary character to that of Dr. David Keel, played by Ian Hendry. Only two and a third of the twenty-six episodes from the first season of the long running show have survived and they are all included here. Considering the age of the material and the less than perfect conditions in which they've been maintained, the quality of these prints are surprisingly good. Indeed, in many cases, this restoration and remastering is certainly superior to the discs of the later stories featuring Mrs. Cathy Gale, which were released a few years back. These episodes really have very little relation to those later episodes, but they are still engrossing enough and you can begin to see the formula for the more widely known later format emerging. Steed himself doesn't even appear in two of these stories - or at least he doesn't appear in what remains of one - and thus Dr. Keel is given his chance to shine in the lead role, abetted only by his `nurse' played by Ingrid Hafner. A far cry from the later Avengers ladies.

Even though I consider myself a huge Avengers fan, this is the first time I've seen these stories and I am not at all disappointed. But if you are a fan of the Emma Peel and Tara King episodes, then I suspect these stories may not be of much interest to you other than from a historical point of view.

Mrs. Peel does get to appear on this release with two gems from the archives. The black and white ""Chess Board"" introduction that was used to open her first season on US TV is included, as is the very short color mini-episode filmed as an introduction to the characters of Steed and Mrs. Peel for American viewers. There's also an episode from The New Avengers, made in 1977 that features a cameo by Mrs. Peel, albeit using rehashed film footage from a decade earlier. As this is already available in The New Avengers 77 box set, its inclusion here is a little redundant. But there's a gem to be had in a documentary made for British TV in 1991 - Avenging the Avengers - which features interviews with MacNee, Honor Blackman, Linda Thorson and many of the production team, along with some footage of Dame Diana Rigg from earlier interviews. Plus there's bonus footage not seen in the original broadcast.

It's all terrific stuff and a very worthwhile bonus disc. Thanks to A&E indeed for gathering up this `stray' material. It's much appreciated.",1142380800,37,3026,4.496363636363636
2193665,5,B0006SH25C,"My husband is a HUGE x-files fan and has always wanted the series on DVD.  There is NO WAY I'd pay $810.00 for the complete series so I did some research and found it on Amazon UK for $271.00 US dollars (including freight). You do need to know a couple of things though.  First, U.S. DVDs are region 1 and U.K. DVDs are region 2.  YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THESE DISCS ON YOUR REGULAR DVD PLAYER.  You will need to buy a region free dvd player.  The one I bought is now discontinued by the mfg but I paid $150 for it online. Just do a search for region free dvd players. Secondly, most of these sets are sold via third party and they don't ship orders internationally. I did get mine from Amazon UK and not a third party.  It seems as though there is limited availability so they don't always have it.  I just checked their website regularly (for about a month) and got lucky. If you really want the complete set, want it affordably and are patient, you can get it. My husband is thrilled with it.  It arrived in great condition and in a timely manner.  He has watched several episodes and they play beautifully.  By the way, I bought the complete Ally McBeal series from Amazon UK for myself for less than $150. It's not even offered here in the US.

No, Amazon, forget the fact that everyone and his brother has pointed out the multitudes of other places from which this set can be obtained just as easily for but a fraction of cost. Just forget that.  Rather, double your price.  IF you do that, you'll make it seem that you're so obscene in your pricing, that you have to be offering a superior, but altogether exact same, product.  Brilliant move.  These incremental moves from $600 to $800 and change are for nancy-boys.  Do it big, and do it right.  Move straight up to $1600 or something.

At long last, ""Avengers"" fans here in the US will get to see on DVD the two surviving episodes from the show's first season with Ian Hendry as Dr. David Keel, and also the first twenty minutes of the very first episode ""Hot Snow"" which is all that survives.  The tone of this first season is radically different from the ""Avengers"" we know and love best with Diana Rigg, but ""Avengers"" fans will need to get this to see how it all began.

The ""New Avengers"" episode that featured an unimaginative cameo of Mrs. Peel through recycled film footage will also be included in the set, but it's the Ian Hendry episodes that make this essential.

2193670,5,B0006SH25C,"I agree with the reviewer below.  This is a great box set, but it is hideously overpriced.  I recommend that if you truly want this for a lower price, visit the amazon.co.uk site.  You can get the UK version that was just released for 134.99.  That's what I did.  Ended up paying about $230 US, including S&H.

Of course, this only works if you have a DVD player set to play region 2 DVDs.  But that's an easy fix.  :)

I'm not quite sure why the US version costs almost 3 times as much as the UK version, because they both have the same episodes and extras on the 59 discs.
