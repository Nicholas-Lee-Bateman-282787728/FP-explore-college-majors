5008411,1,B006O1OTVA,"How could the UFC put this out without specifically saying it is just highlights of these fights. Disgraceful, I want my money back",1332806400,7,131,4.739130434782608
5008412,2,B006O1OTVA,"I got the Blu-ray in hopes that it would contain full fights as the running time was listed as being longer than the DVD version. The main feature is only 2hrs 4mins and only contains two full fights, Velasquez vs Dos Santos and Silva vs Leben, both of which are super quick 1st round knock outs. As far as full fights go, that's it for the first disc, everything else is just highlights. Also, no bonus features on the first disc, just the 2 hour highlight reel. The second disc does contain full fights but there are not ""30 ultimate matches including 13 title fights,"" there's only 20 bonus fights and (off the top of my head) only 7 of them are title fights.

It seems that someone wised up and figured out that people were just getting the 'Best of' collections and skipping the event DVDs and still getting most of the good fights of the year. So I guess they decided to make this years 'Best of' into a teaser in order to try and get you to spend more money and pick up the events on DVD. This wouldn't be an issue for most except that they only release the events on DVD in SD quality which is a big concern to some. I would gladly buy the events on Blu-ray but they don't release them this way so I can really only pick up compilations that come out on Blu-ray and hope that they include the fights I'm interested in. I really hope that they move to releasing the events in DVD/Blu-ray combo packs or just separate editions on each format because I can't even buy compilations anymore because of this highlight non-sense.

It really is surprising how a company can have the best year of its existence only for the 'Best of' compilation to be such a letdown.

5008414,2,B006O1OTVA,"I wanted this DVD to relive fights that I enjoyed from 2011 as well as to see fights I had not yet seen. Amongst putting in the DVD I was pumped to watch these fights.
 First fight was JDS vs. Velasquez, but was highly disappointed to find out the rest of the fights were not full fights, but mere highlights of the best parts of the fights...
 Don't expect to watch the full fights that you paid for because that's not what you will get. This irritates me to no end. I feel like I got ripped off, I bought the DVD, I just want to watch the full fights!! I almost feel like I want to go find a rip off copy of these fights, why? Because I already paid for them.. and I didn't get them. Call me an angry customer.",1332115200,5,712,3.972027972027972
5008415,3,B006O1OTVA,I bought this dvd for the matches that were not going to be put out on dvd ( I own all  the event and seasons of the Ultimate Fighters). I thought it was a little overpriced as it was just for the five fights I wouldn't be able to own otherwise. What I got was highlights of all the fights instead of the full matches. This is really just for a causal fan and not for the hardcore fan. There's a second disk with some full matches on it. The two fights shown in full (not on event dvds) were Velasquez vs Dos Santos and Guida vs Henderson.,1332028800,12,539,3.990740740740741

5008417,4,B006O1OTVA,"Having attended a few UFC cards live last year (UFC 130, UFC Versus Pittsburgh, UFC 132, UFC 133, & UFC Versus Washington DC), there were some incredible fights that I can't wait to re-watch on Blu-Ray.  They have not yet announced the fights yet but out of the 13 title fights, a few of them I would not consider the best of 2011 just because they are title fights (GSP vs Jake Shields was a snooze fest, and Florian vs Aldo was as well)... I really hope they revive some of the fights that were on the undercards like Michael McDonald vs Edwin Figueroa, Edson Barboza vs Anthony Njokuani, Nik Lentz vs Charles Oliveira, & Alex Cacerees vs Jimmy Hettes... Tons of great fights last year and I hope they can get it right on this blu ray... with 17 fights left, I'm sure they will",1330300800,,779,4.335616438356165
5008418,2,B006O1OTVA,"The cover is deceiving stating 30 ""matches"" when it should say ""match highlights"".

It doesn't take a genius to figure out both discs should be nothing but full fights starting in chronological order. This way you can review the prior year in proper context. I would've left enough room (appx. 2 fights worth) for a 15 minute highlight reel at the end of disc 2 from fights that didn't make the final cut. HOW people in charge make such moronic decisions is beyond me. I don't have a college degree and if put in charge I could've produced a better reviewed product than this!

This is a step down from the past 3 annual blu-ray editions at appx. the same price. Companies should only be trying to improve their products like Madden games. Every year they try to make it better NOT take features away!",1330128000,3,801,4.517241379310345
5008419,5,B006O1OTVA,"Review changed thanks to UFC's deceiving packaging.

As you will see from other reviews, despite promising 30 ultimate matches and 13 title fights, you actually get 22 full fights and approx 7 full title fights - the rest are chopped up highlights.

This set is still very good, and the 22 complete fights are excellent ... however, it's a massive step down in quality from the amazing 2010 Blu-ray set and also the 2009 Blu-ray set.  However, it's not as bad as the 2008 set!",1328745600,6,476,4.576470588235294
5008420,3,B006O1OTVA,"MMA fans are critical, so I'm not surprised by the ridiculous amount of ""1"" stars on this product- but those reviews shouldn't be taken seriously. Yes, the majority of the fights are just highlights unless they ended early in the 1st round, which is why I gave this product a 3 instead of a 5. However, you are still getting a great value & the 2nd disc does have a good number of full fights. The problem I believe, is they take up pointless space on the disc with background information on the fighters & events before they show the fights. They should cut that out. I'm buying this disc for the fights, not to hear someone talk about the fights. However, those giving this 1 star should buy the ""Ultimate Fight Collection""s if they don't see any value whatsoever in this blu-ray. I'm not looking to pay that much and have that many discs sitting around.",1353369600,,856,4.45859872611465
5008421,2,B006O1OTVA,"I bought this set after so long because of the recent price drop and I have to admit that previous reviews I have read really hit it pretty spot on.  The first disc, DVD or Blu-ray, is just a typical show based off of highlights

I don't think it's any surprise at this point that this product isn't what fans were expecting.  I think the mistake that the people who put this set together really made was that they weren't just gearing this towards a casual fan, but the kind of person who really doesn't know anything about the trend of how 2011 went.  It basically shows every big name fight while emphasizing the important parts of each bout.  Highlights really aren't that important to me, personally speaking.  Especially when most of the fights highlighted are noteworthy fights worth being on a set in their full.  Realistically, would Cheick Kongo vs. Pat Barry been such a crime to have in its entirety, or even Tito Ortiz vs. Ryan Bader?  These are both one round fights and although the action didn't come off with a bang to say that they were big points of the year would be an understatement.  Replacing full fights for a show composed of highlights felt a lot like a slap in the face.  It also hurts the fact that on the Blu-ray many of the fights shown on the highlight reel were shown in their full on the second disc so it came off feeling repetitive.

I think the 2007 set was the best set the UFC has put out to date because not only were highlights kept to a minimum but it emphasized fights that were truly the best of (with the exception of missing both of Couture's fights that year) but it had variety.  Now, I'll admit that the fights that are on this set are well balanced between true ""best of"" but the set attempts to balance out quantity against quality with a number of the fights.  Who doesn't love a good knockout?  But what other reviews fail to mention is that while the number of fights on this set are comparable to other sets most of these fights are short, and I mean short first round knockouts.  I think another problem with that is knowing that many of the knockouts on this set will be shown later in ""Ultimate Knockouts"".  At least this set emphasized a few fights that involved fighters that are not as well known, something that every set since 2007 has tried to touch upon but has gone more with selling big names rather than quality fights.

This is what it boils down to for me personally, the 2011 set feels like a cheap shot at the fans who rely on these sets to buy the best fights of the year.  Let's face it, sometimes it's just smarter to buy these sets.  But the way this set works it feels slightly insulting.  MMA fans are generally a pretty knowledgeable group of people (at least I think so).  So, when it comes to sets like these it really does come across like a slap to the face.

It's long enough into the current year to realize just how important 2011 felt.  2012 has been marred by injuries, cancelled fights, rearranged cards and it really goes to show just how big of a year 2011 truly was.  Not to say it hasn't been a good year, a few fights certainly stand out and it represents the opportunity to make up for this set.  Cause, at this rate pay per views aren't as packed from top to down to really warrant a buy.  Again, hopefully the next set is better.",1353110400,2,3326,4.341423948220065
5008422,2,B006O1OTVA,"Unfortunately, the UFC has swung and completely missed on this one.  We get less fights in their entirety than last year.  This is very disappointing given that an avid UFC fan can only get these fights on blu ray through this Best of disk.  It is a shame the UFC has changed course on what was always a great annual Best of release just to, for what I can only assume, is to get more sales out of the event DVDs.  I, for one, am not biting on the event DVDs after wasting my hard earned money on this DVD set.  Way to turn off the fans who spend enough money on the live PPV's.",1338595200,,578,3.991304347826087
5008423,1,B006O1OTVA,"Its mostly just highlights...  The previous best of were great this ones falls far short especially considering the beginning where they talk about ""changing it all""",1337990400,2,165,5.346153846153846
5008424,1,B006O1OTVA,"The first annoying thing on this dvd is that the dvd shows the finishes and results of the fights in the intro before it shows the highlights of those fights.  So you know who has won each fight before you start watching the main part of the dvd.
In addition, the highlights of each fight are short.  They are cut up so much that they do not let you get in the mood for the fights.  This is unnecessary.  The UFC suits did not cut out all of that action so that they could fit more fights onto each disc.  How much material can a dvd disc hold?  Over 3 hours?  The first disc of this 'best of UFC 2011' only has 2 hours worth of footage and yet the UFC businessmen have chopped out most of the action from the fights.  For example, Noguiera vs Mir, they don't show you Noguiera's initial domination of Mir with his superior boxing and just cut it to the last moments of the fight where Mir submits Noguiera.
Why have they cut so much out of the fights?  Here is my guess: the UFC are using this as a 2 hour long set of trailers that is supposed to give you a taste for the full events so that you buy a dvd for each event.  This is cynical and aggressive marketing and I will be boycotting all of the UFC dvds until I have heard that they present a proper 'best of' dvd.  If this dvd is meant as a trailers package through which to advertise the full event dvds, then the UFC suits are sly almost to the point of crooked.
This snippets of action from each fight on disc 1 will insult the intelligence spans of probably all who watch it.
This dvd is a waste of money; watching the first disc is a waste of time.  It is a waste of time ordering and waiting for this product.  I could have played my guitar last night instead.  What a waste of time watching the first disc was!",1337817600,2,1774,4.060344827586207
5008425,2,B006O1OTVA,There isn't much to say beyond that this set advertises over 30 full fights but that is simply untrue.  On previous sets there were full fights that played as part of the feature montage in addition to several full bonus fights. I believe 2010 had 40+ full fights while this set only has around 5 full fights. It's a disappointing highlight reel from the year and many of the highlights aren't that great.  I was upset with this compilation.,1337385600,2,441,4.569620253164557

5008427,3,B006O1OTVA,"I was HIGHLY disappointed to learn that the UFC has made the regretful decision to show only highlights on the first disc of this release. Having previously purchased Best of 2009, Best of 2010, and 100 Ultimate Greatest Fights, I look forward to being able to watch complete fights on Blu Ray.

Despite this, there are still a lot of really fun fights on the second disc, shown in their entirety, especially fights like Edgar/Maynard 2 and 3, Cerrone vs Diaz, and Guida vs Henderson. Still, its somewhat of a tease to see these great fights in full, then be stuck watching only highlights of Cruz vs Johnson or Aldo vs Hominick.

Disc 2 contains 10 full fights and it's the stuff that the fans want, not the overview that is disc 1.
