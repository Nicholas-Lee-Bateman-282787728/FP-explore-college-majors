Both films have killer dogs though. The action was very good. Those looked like real vicious wild dogs. The music was very good and super creepy too at times. Lots of intense moments in this one. I had a fear of dogs most of my life and this movie really scared me at times. I would highly recommend checking out this one. Thanks to my buddy in Australia for recommending me this one. I wrote this review once for the on demand version to rent. The bluray is great too, looks nice in HD and has a making of The Pack as well. Can't go wrong with this Pack. 5/5",1467676800,4,734,4.034246575342466
8757079,5,B01DX0NCOY,"Mans best friend becomes his worst nightmare when a horde of bloodthirsty wild dogs descends upon a familys farmhouse. In a remote stretch of the Australian Outback, a sheep rancher (Jack Campbell), his veterinarian wife (Anna Lise Phillips), and their two teenage children live in bucolic isolation: until a horrifying night when a pack of , rabid beasts besiege their home. I hate to make such a broad statement but I love me some Australian films. This one is no exception at all, such a ton of suspense and implied danger. The one and maybe only drawback is the typical angry daughter. I really loved the performances because for all intents and purposes all 4 of these performers and the pack themselves were the only performers and did a great job all around. will I recommend this....absolutely but this is very intense at parts so the age may be a factor.",1495497600,,863,4.7218543046357615

8757081,5,B01DX0NCOY,"SEE. THIS. FILM. The Pack (2015) is a gem of Australian Horror, the kind of movie that makes wading through all the other dreck worthwhile. When I first saw the cover art, I assumed this was from the cheap-but-occasionally-charming SyFy Channel school of film-making. I was wrong. This is a smartly scripted and acted story. The situation is simple enough. It's about an Australian family in a remote farmhouse who find themselves under siege by wild dogs, a Night of the Living Canines scenario. Tense, frightening, and atmospheric, it's a beautifully crafted movie. Move over, Cujo, I'm declaring it top dog in this category. Unqualified purchase recommendation for lovers of man vs. animal films. (I have the DVD and it's well-mastered, nearly blu-ray quality.)",1480291200,,764,5.169354838709677

8757086,1,B01DX0NCOY,"Utterly contrived and very tame killer-dog movie. You might just fall asleep before it even gets to the first dog scratch...

I love creature features, but this is no Cujo.

The Pack is more of a familial drama with a handful of brief dog-attack scenes thrown in. Much of the run time is bereft of action and is mostly comprised of long stretches of ""suspense"" (I use quotes because it's not intense at all) where the family just tries to be quiet while an unseen dog may or may not be stalking nearby. Occasionally, one of the dogs will jump out and attack, but its all PG-esque rapid-editing that just shows snapping jaws, the victim gargling and some blood (though the very first kill--one of ONLY two--has some brief gore). Every scene of ""tension"" plays out the exact same (long stretches of characters either whispering into walkie-talkies or performing actions VERY slowly for fear of a dog hearing them; random dog sometimes jump-scares and immediately gets killed by his human prey). From the first minute of the movie, the storyline goes nowhere, doesn't evolve or even have a climactic finale. It's all just SO standard, so boring and completely lacking in suspense, terror, ingenuity or even a single standout moment or attack (gotta love them off-camera bits). The whole movie feels as intimate as a shrug.

Even someone who's never seen this movie could correctly guess how it plays out/ends as it does nothing to deviate from what's been done better before it.

It's also hard to root for our heroes/be against the enemy herein as the antagonists are just dogs with nothing more to their behavior than simple instinct. They're not evil. By the end, all I could think was congrats... You just killed a bunch of dogs? in Cujo, the dog's demise was something necessary but tragic due to the compelling plot structure, incredible practical effects and sets (the bedroom construction/scene for one) and the build-up for Cujo himself; witnessing him go from good to bad. From man's best friend to vicious killer.

The Pack is like The Breed (or like the recent and equally terrible Night of the Wild) but with a larger budget and more polish. However, it's also extremely boring, not dramatic, not suspenseful and not even the music is interesting in the least. Everything about The Pack is extremely by the numbers; the kind of movie you stream for free and then forget a week later. Movies like this can be done well (The Prey for one) if they apply even a semblance of originality, but as it is, The Pack is just a sluggish, uneventful hour and a half of fearful looks and an occasional dog bite.",1469750400,,2608,4.73568281938326
