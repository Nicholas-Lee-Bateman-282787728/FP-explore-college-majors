8668254,4,B00LULFVUW,I enjoyed this documentary but it could have had a few more full songs on it.,1432512000,,77,3.875
8668255,3,B00LULFVUW,For being a documentary on Meddle they did not play one song in it's entirety I was disappointed in this DVD it could have been a lot better,1422403200,5,140,4.035714285714286
8668256,3,B00LULFVUW,"This review explores the era during which Pink Floyd made their transition from a Psychedelic band in distress to the full-on Progressive Rock of Meddle and forward.  The usual suspect in these documentaries appear, giving their views, some informed, some not so bright. As usual for these sorts of things, the music itself is given short-shrift in favor of other issues.",1421798400,7,371,5.081967213114754
8668257,2,B00LULFVUW,"Like many of you, I am a sucker for anything that might appear to be new about PF. If this video was about PF circa 1971 my guess is there would have to be SOMETHING new and interesting to fill the running time. However, this video is really a full history of PF up to DSOTM. As such, there is no new material of any kind, just some unknown talking heads informing us that PF were really revolutionary and great - wow! Keen insight.",1419206400,12,432,4.154761904761905
8668258,5,B00LULFVUW,"Ordered this for my husband for Christmas.  Meddle is his favorite Pink Floyd album and from the reviews I read, this one focuses on the making of Meddle (among other things).  He's going to love this!  I'll review the DVD after we see it.",1418515200,,239,4.386363636363637
8668259,5,B00LULFVUW,Thank you!,1417651200,,10,4.5
8668260,1,B00LULFVUW,"What a surprise, a Pink Floyd DVD with nothing original by Pink Floyd, a few out-takes from 'Live at Pompeii', no interviews with any members of the band and only a few minutes, total, of snippets of Pink Floyd music. This should be titled, 'Old Rock & Roll Journalists Talk About Pink Floyd for an Hour"".",1417392000,27,305,4.464285714285714
