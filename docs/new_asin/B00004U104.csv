1353320,5,B00004U104,"""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" is one of the best, if not the best, film that touched on so many important issues that effect the every day lives of lesbians each and every day.  Each episode was so well  written, cast, acted and directed that I never tire of watching the film  again and again.  The first episode with Vanessa Redgrave was so  heartwrenching to those of us in the gay community who know how few rights  we have under the laws that are inherent to the heterosexual community.  Yet by the same token it sent such an important message to the heterosexual  community of the basic human and legal rights that gays are denied by not  being allowed to marry.  Not having grown up in the 60's, the second  episode was eye opening to me from a generational standpoint, yet no matter  what the era, the message about stereotyping and exclusion was provocative  and it was a reminder to us to be accepting, rather than exclusionary, even  within our own gay community.  The third episode with Ellen DeGeneres and  Sharon Stone was outstanding.  The dialog was funny and poignant, the  acting was superb, the directing was well done and the message came through  loud and clear.  Love and families know no boundaries of race, gender,  sexual orientation, ethnicity, generation, etc.  As long as people love and  care for each other as human beings, eventually the ugliness, hatred, bias,  bigotry and discrimination don't matter quite so much.  They can all be  overcome and we all have the capacity for acceptance and change.  It just  doesn't get any better than that.  And while many of our goals are a long  way off and we have many battles to fight, films like ""If These Walls  Could Talk 2"" and the courageous people who make and broadcast them  help to bridge that chasm of misunderstanding and bring us all a little  closer together as a society.",963187200,43,1859,4.638888888888889
1353321,2,B00004U104,"What Happened?  This is a sad follow-up to the incredible ""If These Walls Could Talk"".  I was excited about the potential when I first saw the show advertised. Homosexuality can be as divisive a topic as abortion  in our society and the potential for this film to reach out and enlighten  the hetrosexual population in the same manner as ""ITWCT - 1"" was  great.  Once again, the film contains a trilogy of shorts each depicting a  different era.  It starts out with a bang with Vanessa Redgrave (who was  absolutely incredible)portraying an elderly lesbian dealing with the death  of her partner.  I was in tears by the end of this first segment.  It was  even more poignant because the situations she encounters are still  realities in today's world; they have not been relegated to the past.  Unfortunately, the second segment seemed to be a re-hash from ""Boys  Don't Cry"" - It almost felt like it was something that hit the editing  floor from that movie and the producers wanted to still use it....so they  stuck it in here.  The third and final episode was absolutely the  lamest....basically an R-rated Ellen episode with lots of prolonged bedroom  scenes between Sharon Stone and Ellen.  All in all, I would buy this for  the first segment, but feel that more time should have been spent on  development of the other two stories.",961632000,6,1336,4.7336244541484715

Three generations of people in very different times in their lives all share a commonality of being queer women within the same house but given the political climate around what it means to be queer each generation has very different experiences. The film deals with the hopes, dreams, sadness and joys of everyday life but from a specifically queer experience.",1466035200,3,558,4.88421052631579

1353349,3,B00004U104,"Since I enjoyed the original IF THESE WALKS COULD TALK on DVD recently, I took some online advice from a review that said the sequel was even better. Trust meit isnt. I assumed that the stories would be another abortion anthology and since Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres were pictured in a loving pose on the cover, that one of the tales would involve a lesbian couple.

All three stories are about problems faced by lesbian couplesno abortion dilemmas this time aroundset in 1961, 1972 and 2000 in the same house that was featured in the original film. I can only recommend the first segment, in which Vanessa Redgrave gives one of her usual tour-de-force performances as a schoolteacher who loses her life partner Marian Seldes unexpectedly. From the opening scene in a dark movie theatre where the two are watching the climactic scene in THE CHILDRENS HOUR where Shirley Maclaine professes her feelings for Audrey Hepburn (and basically seeing themselves onscreen), to the awkwardness of the hospital scene where she learns shes just become a widow yet is not recognized as such, Redgrave underplays perfectly and rips your heart out. But things get worse when Seldes nephew and his wife (Elizabeth Perkins making the most of a small part) swoop in to start picking over Aunties belongings. Not only is Redgrave treated like nothing more than a roommate, she learns she is being evicted and many of her prize possessions are being handled and snatched up like ripe produce at a farmers market. This kind of thing is likely still happening today and should serve as a warning for same-sex couples to ensure they have an iron-clad will to stop greedy relatives from picking them clean.

Unfortunately, the second and third segments are a severe come-down from the first, with the 1972 story featuring Michelle Willlams as a radical feminist whose friends have been banned from their college womens group due to their agenda. When they stop in at a lesbian dive bar to brood, Williams meets and becomes intrigued with the mannish Chloe Savigny, much to the frustration of her pals, who see Savigny as nothing more than another subjugating male with a vagina. I suppose the story is about accepting ones self as is, but it is nowhere as meaty or interesting as the first.

The final act is even more frivolous with Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres as a successful yuppie couple trying to conceive. When the two aren't sitting on the hood of their car staring longingly at school kids on their recess break (creepy) or making love to Dido in extended montages, Stones dancing around to Annie Lennox or Natalie Cole in her pajamas and Ellens doing her usual stammer (this time about how shes angry she cant get Stone pregnant!). The only message I got from all this was how privileged and lucky these two were compared to the women in the 1961 segment.

Worth seeing for Redgraves performance but overall lacks the punch of the 1996 original. Act I gets five stars, Act II gets three and Act III gets two stars from this reviewer.",1437264000,,3029,4.78585086042065

1353351,5,B00004U104,"This is the second installment of the HBO ""I These Walls Could Talk"" series and it is just as powerful as the first. The three individual stories take place in different decades, but all in the same house as it changes ownership through the years. In the first, Vanessa Redgrave struggles as her life partner passes away, and she forces herself to conceal the true depth of their relationship when her partner's family comes to take over the house that the couple lived in, and she has to move out and leave so many of their memories and mutual possessions behind. In the second part, Michelle Williams and Chloe Sevigny play college age girls who fall for each other but have to endure the constant scrutiny and negativity of those around them. In the third, Ellen DeGeneres and Sharon Stone play a couple who want to have a baby together in their own way. All three stories are well-acted and make you laugh and cry.",1433894400,,918,4.569696969696969

1353364,5,B00004U104,"This brilliant lesbian drama traces the evolution of the feminist movement beginning with the inception of the bra-burning era of the sixties with the opening of the anthology in 1961, when two elderly lesbian couples tender loving relationship is shattered after one of the ladies falls from a ladder while attempting to avoid a sterling that is escaping the bird house while checking on a new egg laid by the sterling, and her lesbian lover contacting her nephew who was named in her will - who insists on selling the house to avoid an inheritance tax being levied by Uncle Sam and forcing his aunts lover to relocate, despite the fact that his aunts lover owned half the house, given the fact that she had jointly paid for the mortgage with his aunt, and insisting on taking everything belonging to his aunt with total disregard for his aunts lovers feelings; the second segment moving forth to 1972, during the era, when the lesbian community were struggling against dressing code stereotypes, and were just breaking free of those dress codes by dressing in a feminine fashion, a group of lesbians found objection with one of their lesbian members taking up with a lesbian that feels more comfortable in tomboyish clothes, and seeks to have her dress in feminine clothes  that makes her uncomfortable, and seeks to break-up their friend relationship to no avail; and the final segment fast forwards to the year 2000, just as it was becoming acceptable for lesbian couples to seek artificial insemination by sperm donors and features Sharon Stone and real life lesbian, Ellen DeGeneres, searching for a donor with the right profile for whom they conceived of what they want their child to be and finally getting Sharon Stone pregnant by inseminating her during the period of ovulation, much to their delight.

1353366,5,B00004U104,"All three of these stories are bittersweet, each in it's own way.  They reflect three, very different, time periods in the lives of lesbians.  In the first story the love the two women have for each other is almost palpable.  Having been the world to each other just to have their world torn apart by lack of the protection of laws concerning healthcare and death, and the insensitivity and greed of ""family"" members whose blood gives them rights over love, shows us both how far we have come and how far we have to go.  This story is still going on everyday in the U.S. as well as the rest of the world even though it is not as common as it once was.

The second story also has a then-and-now theme.  Prejudice towards those people who are different from the majority in any way is still rampant, be it femme/butch, black/white, college educated/trade educated, etc., etc.  The culture has changed in many ways since the '70s but minority groups of all sorts are still largely marginalized.

The third story's light-hearted view of being childless is fun and interesting, but no less heartbreaking to childless couples, be they straight, lesbian, gay or mixed-race.  Just because this couple is lesbian does not mean they are any less sad than straight couples.  Besides their childlessness they must endure society's view that it just couldn't be that important to them or they would have married men.

Laws have changed somewhat since the '50s and so has our culture.  Even so, everyday life for lesbians and gays is a struggle in some way, battling the prejudicial views and misconceptions of the dominant culture.  And that is the good part.  There are many, many places and ways that LBGTQs are not only discriminated against but downright hated, attacked (physically and emotionally) and killed and the end is not in sight.

On a happier note, this film is awesome.  The stories and acting are superb, especially including the nuances of how lesbians were/are together as they go through the world.",1409184000,,2005,4.784883720930233

The family comes in and takes her home, her belongings, etc. and she is left with basically nothing after a lifetime of love.  It then moves to the 70's - same house - and then present day.

I really think that EVERYONE should watch this movie to get an understanding about the Gay lifestyle and what they go thru. Gay people want the same rights as heterosexuals... and why shouldn't they have it?

Whats so wrong about falling in love with someone of the same sex? So what? Who are they hurting? So men fall in love with men and women fall in love with women. Big Deal. If it makes them happy and that's who they choose then why not? Who are we to judge?

People need to open their eyes and their hearts and just realize that they're PEOPLE who just happen to love the SAME SEX!

1353411,4,B00004U104,"This movie presents the lives of lesbians, all of whom have lived in the same house, in three seperate ""chapters"".  The movie spans over 40 years.  The first piece is about two older lesbians and is set in the early 1960's. One of the women dies and you see how people outside the relationship deal with the surviving partner.  It is touching, yet a reminder of why we need to be so vigilant.

The second piece is set in the 70's.  While it is interesting to see the development of the consciousness of the young women, it is a bit sterotyped.

The final pice is set only a few years ago.  It is current, funny (after all Ellen Degeneres is in it) and sexy (Sahron Stone is in it).  It deals with modern issues in serious and light-hearted ways.  Taken all together the three pieces tell a very interesting story of lesbians and how their lives haved changed over the decades.

I was living in a Women's Studies dorm on a college campus that year. I'd be the first to call an off note or historical inaccuracy. There isn't a single nuance of this part that is false. From the clothing to the feminist/Lesbian standoffs to the Lesbian bar...all pitch perfect. Michelle Williams and Chloe Sevigny were terrific...lovely work from both of them.

The 3rd segment with Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres fell very flat for me. Stone did nice work but the story just didn't work for me. It is possible that following such an amazing act was not fair. I found myself wanting more of the 1972 piece and less of the Stone/Degeneres one.

Redgrave has been properly lauded for the ""1960"" piece but I think Paul Giamatti gets overlooked too often. He took a thankless role and gave it warmth. I thought it would have been unwatchable without him.",1202774400,4,1000,4.708571428571428

Venessa Redgrave was the first story up, and I didn't think that woman could outdo herself, but she did. I think she got a golden globe and an emmy for her perfomance, it is stunning. The other stories are good as well, and besides Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone as lovers trying to get pregnant was fun to watch. There is another segment with Chloe from Big Love, and a gal name Michelle (I think) who played the wife of Heath Ledger in Brokeback Moutain.

1353422,4,B00004U104,"If These Walls Could Talk 2 explores female same sex relationships in different eras, but in the same house.

The first story deals with an old woman who loses her longtime lover due to a fall from a ladder and the eventual death. The dead woman's son and daughter-in-law and granddaughter show up and basically take what is lawfully theirs, the house and its possessions. The old woman is left with nothing and is forced to start over somewhere else despite being in her 60s. I kept thinking to myself, all of this could have been avoided had the dead woman made a will. This story basically deals with how same sex couples don't have the same legal rights. Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the left-behind lover, can't even visit her companion in the hospital room because she's not a relative or spouse. This was definitely the heartwrenching one of the three vignettes.

The second story takes place during the women's feminist movement. Some college lesbian girls go to a gay bar where one of them, Michelle Williams, meets Chloe Sevigny and a romance develops. The only thing, Sevigny's character is butch. And Williams' friends have a problem with a woman acting like a man in order to live the lesbian lifestyle. They see it as defeating the purpose of being a lesbian in the first place. Pretty good performances all around. Nia Long and Natasha Leonne are in the story: both who have played lesbians in other movies.

The third segment deals with a lesbian couple trying to have a baby. It stars Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone. This one is boring. All you see is frantic anticipation and turkey basters. There is a surprising steamy sex scene. It's surprising because I never thought a sex scene with Ellen Degeneres could be steamy. I applaud Anne Heche as a director for being able to pull that off. But, it's still a less compelling story than the other two.

All in all, If These Walls...2 is a good movie. It's certainly more tolerable than its predecessor.",1157587200,6,1969,4.698550724637681

1353431,4,B00004U104,"""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" is neither as controversial nor as depressing as the first HBO movie in what could be an interesting series if they keep changing the topics as they go along. The first time around the conceit was that all three women who lived in this particular house found themselves pregnant and dealing in different ways at different times in history (post-World War II) with the topic of abortion. This time the house in question is inhabited by lesbians and not only is the death count half what it was before in this 2000 movie, it actually goes with a cute ending, something obviously precluded by the abortion topic.

The common denominator here is to depict the decidedly different problems faced by lesbians at different points in time. In 1961 we have a pair of ""maiden aunts,"" Edith Tree (Vanessa Redgrave) and Abby Hedley (Marian Seldes), who dare not walk too close in public and who have to stop hand holding when anybody might be watching them in a dark movie theater (where, pointedly, ""The Children's Hour"" is showing). When one of the women dies suddenly, the other has to endure her partner's relatives (Paul Giamatti and Elizabeth Perkins) showing up ready to clean her home out. The fact that the two women were lovers is unspoken, but palatable, as insult is added to injury. When I see something like this, where a relationship that has lasted decades is so casually dismissed because it is socially unacceptable, I always think of the irony that Britney Spears getting drunk and decided to get married in Las Vegas (and then annulled) one weekend in Las Vegas is, in contrast, to be considered a sanctified relationship. Irony abounds. This segment is certainly the most touching of the three, and offers solid performances from all involved.

In 1972 a quartet of lesbian college students are inhabiting the house. In contrast to Tree and Abby, these girls get to flaunt their sexual orientation. Then they discover that they are too blatant for the other feminists on campus who are caught up in the women's liberation movement, and are a decidedly different generation of lesbians from those who came before when they come across a lesbian bar. The culture clash comes crashing down on Linda (Michelle Williams), who finds she is interested in Linda (Chlo Sevigny), who binds her breasts and wears a shirt and a tie. Here the irony is that her housemates (Nia Long, Natasha Lyonne), who do not want to be judged by others, are so willing to judge other lesbians for not doing it the right way. Some lesbians being prejudiced against other lesbians is an interesting twist.

When we get to 2000 the problem faced by Fran (Sharon Stone) and Kal (Ellen DeGeneres) their lesbianism is not so much a problem as a twist. The couple want to have a baby, which means they have to jump through the same sort of hoops faced by couples with more traditional, for lack of a better word, problems with infertility. This segment stands out from the others because it is pure comedy where the conflict is over which sperm donor to use and finding creative ways to keep for Fran to keep her legs in the air to help facilitate the fertilization. Regina King and Kathy Najimy join in on the fun as well.

The 2000 segment was written and directed by Anne Heche, a fact that adds all sorts of interesting elements of irony to watching it. The 1961 segment was written and directed by Jane Anderson, while the 1972 segment is directed by Martha Coolidge with a teleplay by Sylvia Sichel, who wrote the story with Alex Sichel. The three segments are certainly sympathetic to the sexual orientation of the characters, who are spared any overt attacks on their life style, unlike the women in the first film, where both sides were present in all three stories. Now the question is what will they come up for the ""If These Walls Could Talk 2""? Will it continue to be a female oriented series or do walls talk about males as well? Stay tuned.",1123372800,4,3960,4.685344827586207

The acting is perfect, they make you feel all the emotions you're supposed to feel in different scenes. Its 3 short stories that all have a different meaning/struggle within lesbianism. The first one is about and elderly lesbian couple and how they had to hide all their life even after one of them  was gone. The remaining ""wife"" was left with no one else in the world. The second one takes place around the hippie era when feminist activists were at large. It shows how the butch type lesbians were looked down upon. The last one stars Ellen and Sharon Stone as a lesbian couple in the 20th century trying to have children and how difficult it can be. I hope I didn't give away too much but its just hard to explain the plots without giving it away! I really do recommend this to everyone. I say everyone not just gay people because I think its something that even straight people need to be aware of.

1353440,3,B00004U104,"As much as I admire what this movie tries to be, the end result is not terribly impressive. This series of 3 short stories deals with various lesbian issues over a span of time. The first story is about an elderly lesbian couple and the lack of legal rights for same-sex partners. The second story is about ""being yourself"" and draws an interesting parallel between the women's group that excludes the lesbians (because they're too radical) and the lesbians who exclude the cross-dresser. The final story is about two lesbian Yuppies who want to have a baby and mostly consists of Sharon Stone dancing around in her pajamas and being ""wacky.""
Although these are all interesting issues, the movie itself is strictly by-the-numbers. There's nothing original or creative about any of this; the acting is mediocre, the dialogue is mediocre, the cinematography is mediocre... it's more of an exercise in pro-lesbian propaganda than an actual movie.
Mind you, I agree with everything it's saying, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a film that plays it TOO safe. All our protagonists are flawless, endearing people, while all the ""normal"" heterosexual people are ugly, narrow-minded, and hypocritical.  Also, the lesbians are all slim and attractive while the heterosexuals are all overweight. It's this sort of thing that makes you realize that ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" isn't nearly as progressive as it would like to be.

I saw ""The Hours"" first, now this and it features three stories throughout time that happen to occur in the same house. I didn't make the full connection until I saw Vanessa Redgrave and then I remembered her performance as Mrs. Dalloway.
I am most interested in how the stories are told, although not in a single day like ""Mrs. Dalloway"" or ""The Hours"", yet I can't help but feel that this piece had a tremendous amount of influence over the style.
Chloe` is beyond beauty in this film as well as in the film ""Boys Don't Cry"", except it was interesting to first see her in that movie as a very feminine woman, and in this one as the butch. She has a soft seductiveness either way that is extremely spell binding and captivating. I don't think I've ever seen a woman on screen so able to arouse with her silence and gentleness.
Vanessa Redgrave also has such elegance, even in her grief, that her words and manner wins your heart just like she did in her other film as the character Mrs. Dalloway.
Sharon Stone injects new hope into lesbians with her vivacious character who just is *so* in love with the witty Ellen Degenerous. The love scene between the two was a bit over powering, seeing Sharon in that position, I can only surmise what Ellen herself must have felt like during the filming. I'll bet when she got home Anne had some questions for her!
I wondered, in hindsight, if those love scenes may have egged on Anne's stressful change of life? The fear of possibly ""psychologically"" or ""emotionally"" losing Ellen may have triggered her episode and created such anxiety and distress for her internally, exposing her fear of losing the one true love of her life. Seeing this, I feel it may have caused the entire collapse of their relationship and her sanity temporarily as other doors began to close, squeezing her out. Just an observation.

I can't help but watch it everytime it comes on.  I thought every story was very moving, with the perfect cast to pull it all off.  I thought the first segment was very touching, but I couldn't really relate to it, so it was hard to really get into it.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the second and third segments.  The second segment with Michelle Williams, Nia Long, and Chloe Sevigny were fantastic.  It struck a chord in me, I realized how biased the world can be towards one another.  I liked the irony of one lesbian being incredibly ignorant to another, because they weren't ""lesbian"" enough.  It revealed to me how cynical we all can be.  I disagree with a lot of the reviews about the third segment, I thought it was great!  It was humorous and heart-felt.  It is by far, Ellen DeGeneres's best performance.  Sharon Stone was so comical, which the enitre movie needed.  Ellen and Sharon had great chemistry, in my opinion.  The seemed very believable, from the passion towards one-another, to the commitment of trying to conceive.  They were a truly loving and commited couple, which I respected very much.

The idea of that one is really an important one, too bad this silly, kitchy... let's face it, stupid, part ruins it. And the sex scenes with Ellen and Sharon aren't even sexy, very badly done....

I also felt a connection, and understanding. I have never been one to be prejudice agianst people, but I think I was naive. This movie really opened my eyes to a lot.
 I liked this movie, and each segment, but they didn't seem to work together as in the first ITWCT movie. Sure, they all dealt with lesbianism, but all with such differnet angles.
The first segment I have seen many, many times... and I still cant get past it without crying. It was superbly acted by everyone! Vanessa was amazing, I can't think of a word to describe how moving her perfromance was. Elisabeth Perkens was magnicificent. Didn't we all want to slap some sense into her and her husband. Even the little girl acted very well. You got a sence that she instinctively knew what was going on, and with a child's ""honesty"" and naivity (don't think thats a word, but you get the idea) tried to comfort Vanessa in the only way she knew.
The second part didn't speak to me that much. I'm not sure why, but I didn't enjoy it all that much. The scene with the friends trying to change Chloe was horrid and almost painful to watch though. That was the only moving scene for me. As for the lovemaking scene, and I speak for the one in the 3rd segment also, I thought they were tastefully done, and showed the beauty of two women, not the male ""eroticicsm"" factor we normally see of two women. It was beautiful.
The third segment was nice to watch, but was far out of place. It was the only segment in either of the movies that was comical. It seemed a bit light and superficial. Some moments were great, like the turkey baster! And what was with them at the park. If I saw two people, no matter who repeatedly coming to watch children there, none of which were their own, I frankly wouldn't feel comfortable.

To my mind the 1st episode of the trilogy is the most touching, I mean the tenderness of the ild couple. The 2nd is sort of experimental, as the young feminist doesn't really know, that she would like a sexual experience with the female (though I believe she hadn't any serious sexual experience till that moment at all). The last story attracted me by the part Sharon Stone played, I haven't thought that after all the men-tempting roles she would do smth like that. There is no doubt, that she played very naturally but it all seemed to be like a big funny game about a child, and not a real problem that female (as well as male) couples face.
I believe it looks like a scientific analysis, and not like a review, but I wanted to express myself somehow. All I wanted to say is this - if you are sensitive enough to feel the tenderness and beauty of love, you should see this movie, and it doesn't really matter, wether it is love between the representatives of the same sex or ""normal"" relations.

1353461,4,B00004U104,"This movie made me cry, made me think, and made me laugh my head off, all in that order. The stories of 3 generations of lesbians, all intertwined in that they share the same house, from the 50's, to the 70's, to the 00's. They were different characters, different personalities, and different issues, but ALL of them are important not just to lesbians, but to history.
The first story by far is the most powerful. Vanessa Redgrave plays a woman who is widowed after her lover of 50 years passes away. The insensitive nonchalance of her lover's nephew and wife is in stark contrast to the pain on Ms. Redgrave's face as she holds her lover's pajamas in her hands. The use of the glass birds in this story is poignant and important: birds, like love: fragile yet meaningful, often unnoticed, often ignored.
Michelle Williams shone in the 2nd story, about a 1970's ""modern"" woman whose feminist lesbian friends don't understand when Michelle falls in love with an ultra-butch [girl]. It was interesting to see the 1970s prejudice against butch women, knowing that here, in the 00's, lesbians still cant get past those labels of femme and butch. My girlfriend and I actually turned the movie off after this segment and talked about why there is so much internalized prejudice. Although not the most powerful segment, this story, like the first, held the same importance to history.
Last, but certainly not least, Sharon Stone displayed her impeccable comedic timing as the trying-to-get-pregnant partner of Ellen Degeneres. This segment was worth it just for Stone's outfits. Outrageous and laugh-out-loud funny, this 3rd portion of ITWCT2 was nonetheless endearing, especially to lesbians who dream of sharing a child with their partner. The tender moment of the ""conception"" scene had me with tears in my eyes.

The Second Story is terrific! Fantastic cast: Michelle Williams, Chloe Sevigny, Natasha Lyonne...historical look at our Sisters of the 70's. Very relevant for today.
The Third Story is my least Favorite of the Trio...but still quite good. Sharon Stone is suprizingly natural and seems more comfortable in the girl on girl scenes than Ellen DeGeneres (GOOD JOB, SHARON!)...This story is directed by Anne Heche (not bad for a directoral effort).

1353465,5,B00004U104,"This HBO movie should have been a theatrical release. There would have been nothing better than to see these characters on the big screen. All the other reviews give you a synopsis of the plot, so I'll talk about what made this film so great.
Each segment had a thoughtful and detailed script, superbly executed by the actors and the directors. Vanessa Redgrave has never been better, as a woman who loses her life partner. But it's the little historical details that caught my attention. Like Vanessa and her partner waklking home from the movies with 3 feet between them, least anyone suspect they are anything more than friends. And before the newphew and family come to the the house she rearranges the bedroom to make it appear like they are nothing more than roomates.
The second segement, with Chloe Sevigny and Michelle Williams seems to be alot of peoples's favorite, and for good reason. These two have remarkable on screen chemistry together. So much of the sexual tension was delivered though looks. When they looked at each other (and they did it quite often) it spoke volumns. The love making scene is so intimate and real there's no response but silence. Again there are couple of little details here which make me like the film even more. When Sevigny's butch character takes off her shirt her breasts are tightly wrapped, a common thing to do in the historical butch community. Also, when William's character tries to undress Sevigny, she gently but firmly takes Williams hands away from her belt twice, and tells Williams to ""just relax"" letting the audience know that she will be the assertive partner here. That is yet another subtle detail in the sexual history of the butch/fem culture.
And before I move on from this segment I have to comment about how striking Sevigny is as this young butch. I was quite taken by her, and not just by how adorable she looked with her motorcycle jacket and tee-shirts and puppydog blue eyes, although that was definitely a highlight to this film. But after seeing her play sort of a fem opposite Hillay Swank in Boy's Don't Cry, I was impressed by her ability to play the flip side of the coin, with some real sensitivity. She did not take this character over the top, but rather gave us an insightful portrayal of a masculine young woman living on the edge of her own community. My question is, how in the world could she makeout with both Hillary Swank and Michelle Williams, and still not be batting for the other team? Ah well.
As for the last segment, with Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone, a lesbian couple trying to have a baby, all I have to say is that I just enjoyed watching this. Some people complain that Ellen was just her character from her former sit-com put in a new situation. My response to that is, so what. That's exactly what makes her so funny. And what a great lesbian fantasy, to have Sharon Stone for your girlfriend, it doesn't get any better that.
With so much going for it, this film will definitley become one of the classics for our culture. I just hope I don't spend too much money wearing out copy after copy after copy.",1014681600,25,3110,4.615523465703971
1353466,3,B00004U104,"If These Walls Could Talk 2 - An HBO Film.
This made for cable film is the second in a series, focusing on the lives of women and a specific issue. The first film, centered on abortion. This film, on women's sexuality. The format is identical, three stories, placed in three specific timeframes.
Vanessa Redgrave won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her portrayal of an older lesbian in the first segment of this trilogy (taking place in the early 60's).
However, it is not that segment, nor the much over-hyped Sharon Stone/Ellen Degeneres final segment that plays the best.
It is the middle segment, starring a wonderful Michelle Williams (""Dawson's Creek"") and Chloe Sevigny (""Boys Don't Cry"") who I believe really shine here.
It is this central episode of the trilogy that takes place in the 70's during the feminist movement. It is kind and sweet and rings most true. I was most surprised by Michelle William's here - she did an amazing job. ""Dawson's Creek"" does not do her justice as she's proven to be an excellent actress. Chloe Sevigny is always fun and interesting to watch, but I think Michelle Williams really steals her scenes and holds her own with this Indie favorite.
Going back to comment on the opening segment where Vanessa Redgrave plays an older lesbian - Watching Venessa Redgrave is always a pleasure and she's wonderful here, as well. Perhaps it's the tone of the opening segment - it so lacks joy.
Regarding the final story - Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres on the other hand - they don't fare so well. Specifically, I'm not exactly comfortable with them sitting on the hood of thier car watching children play in a park, repeatedly. This would seem down-right creepy regardless of the gender of the couple.
This third segment is the one that seems the less ""real"" or true.
I was also very disappointed that the DVD version of this film had no additional footage or special features.
All in all - this film is worth viewing, but I doubt it would be something you'd watch again and again. You're likely to view your favorite segment more than once, but not the entire thing.
My favorite segment, the one I would recommend for re-watching is the middle one.

1353470,5,B00004U104,"I absolutely loved this movie!!! I've watched the 2nd and 3rd stories three times.  The first I liked but felt it was so sad that I wanted to view it again.
The movie begins with a glowing performance by Vanessa Redgrave.  She loses her partner of 50 years.  What was sad was that she could not grieve over the loss of the one she loved.  She kept her love's secret even in death.  Not telling staff at the hospital that she was family.  That this was the woman she had spent her life with.  Or the wife of a heart attack victim that she too was worried for her partner.  She could not tell her ""in~laws"" that she was their in~law.  She paid a wonderful tribute to her partner out of love.  She removed any item from the home that would tell others of the love they shared, the life they shared.  The ultimate was losing her home, their home to a greedy family.
The second story with Michelle Williams and Chloe is yummy.  I actually had never thought that Lesbians discriminated against themselves.  It opened my eyes and made me feel for those lesbians in the 70's who were butch.  Michelle's school friends are all femme lesbians.  They visit a bar where they are face to face with ""butch"" lesbians.  The friends become uncomfortable and choose to leave.  Yet Michelle stays behind having been attracted to one particular butch at the bar.  I myself am attracted to ""butch"" lesbians so seeing Chloe's tough girl persona and yet shy disposition was a real turn on.  The scene where Chloe visits Michelle's friends and they try and dress her as a girl was very dramatic.  As it makes them face their own fears.  Michelle's statement to her friends when Chloe runs out, That they don't like anyone not just like them is very poignant.  Especially since they are asking to be accepted as lesbians and they themselves can't accept a girl who wants to dress in men's clothing.
The third story is set in the year 2000 where Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone want to have a baby.  It is the trials and tribulations that they face to have children.  For me though, the story of them having a baby was flat.  What was strong in the story and worth the time to watch was the relationship between the two.  I loved the humor between the two.  I loved seeing a Lesbian couple, enjoying life, having fun.  I especially LOVED the sex scene between the two.

1353473,4,B00004U104,"The three stories portray three different phases of lesbian relationships. ""1961"" depicts a 50-year relationship that suddenly ends with the death of one partner; ""1972"" depicts a new relationship between a college-aged lesbian feminist and a blue-collar boyish female; ""2000"" depicts an established relationship of a middle-aged lesbian couple attempting to have a baby. These stories also show the evolution of how lesbians are viewed and accepted in society, the first showing extreme repression, the last showing more openness.
""1961"" is the most emotionally powerful, both in acting and photography. The dark, subdued lighting reflects the somberness of the story and gives the film a nostalgic, long-ago quality. Vanessa Redgrave is superbly brilliant as Edith Tree, the widowed partner who sees her life falling apart after her lover Abby dies. Poignant and sad, the story serves as a painful reminder of the deeply closeted, repressed lives lesbians were forced to lead (and still do to some extent). The two women are shown walking home from a movie, far apart, not daring to touch each other, lest they attract attention and jeers. Before Abby's heirs come over to stake claim on household possessions, Edith carefully removes photos and mementos that would indicate a ""less-than-proper"" relationship between the two spinster schoolteachers. You can see the quiet, intense desperation of Edith when she is denied access to dying lover in the hospital because she is not family; and again when her home and possessions are taken away by the Abby's greedy heirs. Redgrave portrays Edith with dignity, and strength, contrasting splendidly with the callous greediness of her lover's heirs.
""1972"" is the story of a lesbian feminist, Linda, who is attracted to Amy, a butch female whose fashion statement is men's clothing and ace bandages for lingerie. Linda is torn between her intellectual feminist ideology, which eschews traditional male-female roles (even for lesbians), and her strong attraction for the boyish, ""politically incorrect"" Amy. Linda's roommates object to Amy, showing blatant hostility to Amy's nonconformity and her indifference to the feminist movement. Chloe Sevigny is quite a scene stealer as Amy, giving off an androgynous sexiness reminiscent of Elvis Presley or kd lang. The steamy lovemaking scenes are quite arousing, yet tastefully done and fitting with the story. Hair and costuming are especially superb, reminding me of my own high school days in the early 1970s. An underlying message in this story was the exposure of the ""nonconforming conformity"" of the feminist movement, which ultimately caused many lesbian feminists to break away.
""2000"" is a cheerful, sweetly humorous, upbeat story about a lesbian couple wanting to have a baby. Even the lighting, costuming, and sets are bright and cheery, which sharply sets it apart from the previous two stories. Sharon Stone is delightfully daffy as Ellen's girlfriend and the Mother-to-Wanna-Be. Ellen DeGeneres acts too much like Ellen Morgan from her old sit-com. Apparently she hasn't gotten that character out of her system yet, or else Anne Heche did not give her much insight into the character. Speaking of Anne Heche, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see this story is obviously autobiographical-Sharon Stone as ""Fran"" (rhymes-with Anne!) is playing Heche, complete with Anne's hairstyle and ditsy personality. I like the positive portrayal of two caring women who love each other and their desire to have a child. Unfortunately, too much is borrowed from Ellen's old sit-com, resulting in an uneven movie that vacillates between light comedy and downright dumbness. The lovemaking scenes are contrived and appear to be an afterthought-I didn't think they added much to the story at all. DeGeneres looked especially uncomfortable in these scenes, keenly aware that Heche was watching every move she made. While there was definite sexual chemistry and spontaneity between Williams and Sevigny in their lovemaking scenes, Stone's and DeGeneres' lovemaking looked choreographed and rehearsed.
Still, in spite of the flaws of the last story, this film is a must-see for everybody. Buy the DVD from Amazon.com today-you'll find yourself watching it over and over again.",985651200,,4266,5.378176382660688
1353474,4,B00004U104,"I bought this on DVD only a few days ago and it is still on my mind ... pieces from all three segments come to haunt me when I least suspect it.
For instance, the indomitable Vanessa Redgrave, here, so tender and fragile, being told at a hospital by a woman, whose husband has had a heart attack, how lucky she is that she (Vanessa) has never married, for she will ""never know the pain of losing a husband"". Meanwhile Vanessa's character is in that exact pain that moment, as her lover of a lifetime lies in a bed dying. Worse, she is refused access to her, as she is not ""family"".
There was also the awful sight of seeing the next of kin later swoop in and seize upon Vanessa's love's worldly goods as though little more than fun trinkets they stumbled upon... It was a powerful opener. However this first segment was too hard to watch twice, and I doubt many people will want to see it more than once.
The second part did not grab me so much, but I was too young for the '70s to see the feminist movement in its hey day, to see the women's groups distance themselves and grow fragmented from the lesbians, lest they were all tarred by the same brush. I never got to feel the pain where freedom meant not being too butch or too ... whatever... It meant fitting in ""just so"" or not fitting in at all. It was interesting in that horrifying sort of way of politics mingled with peer pressure.
Chloe Sevigny was predictably cute as the adorable, mannishly attired seductress of the femme. It raised some very valid questions and pared back the layers to reveal the hypocrisy of many women during their fight for freedom. But it seemed to me to lack the power and richness, the heart, of the first segment. But not through lack of trying. And all the women in it gave it their all.
The third segment, the much feted Ellen and Sharon Stone piece was what I bought this DVD for. If you are expecting Ellen to rise above her stand-up comic background and turn into a Meryl Streep, forget it. That's not her forte and never will be. She handles the comic elements brilliantly as always, but when expected to deliver a dramatic monologue to camera about how frustrated she is she can't get her girlfriend pregnant, her voice goes up an octave into the whiney zone, and I kept half expecting her to crack a joke, the way she might have on her TV show.
Thus, for our pre-existing comedy expectations, and Ellen's lack of dramatic training, it could be argued she was awfully miscast in this segment.... Except for one very important thing: I doubt I'll ever see a more believable f/f sex scene from Hollywood than that of Ellen and Sharon, because for the first time in who knows how long, at least one of the actresses actually, gasp, looked like she knew what she was doing.
Ellen was convincing in conveying the love. It came across as natural and beautiful instead of salacious and mere titillation for the menfolk, ala Basic Instinct, Sharon's other flick.
And while Sharon was there to look good in this scene (mission accomplished -- and looking eerily like Anne Heche at times), it was actually Ellen who stole it, as she was breathtaking in her sincerity. (Heck her face was even flushed deep red -- as though from passion, or embarrassment, who can say. *g*)
For this scene alone I recommend the DVD. And as a whole, for a beautiful way to showcase these three chapters in lesbian history, you can not do much better than this. A worthwhile edition to the home library.",980553600,8,3468,4.45440251572327

The most refreshing film seen in a long time - at last, something positive for lesbians that was well acted and well scripted...and sexy.  Music was fantastic, but can't believe the remixed version of Dido's 'Thank You' is not available on the cd.

This movie truly opened my eyes on how the same sex can have such a loving bond and the unfair ridicule they are subjected to. You will laugh , cry, and sit in total silence. This story depics three different eras and all ages of lesbians and how living life them as a lesbian is looked upon and how they are treated. From an old couple losing their parner in the 50's to college students coming out and their unacceptance from the community in the 70's to a couple trying to have a child in the 90's. A must see film and an eye opener. Watch Sharron Stone,Chloe Severny, and Vanessa Redgrave.",977875200,12,692,4.290076335877862
1353477,5,B00004U104,"This is a good three-part movie. I think the quality of the segments decline from beginning to end.
The first segment - Vanessa Redgrave stars. It's incredible. It details a lesbian couple in their ""golden-ages"" during the 60s. It is one heck of a performance by Redgrave, who mourns the death of her loved one.
The second segment looks at a group of feminist lesbians - one of whom (Williams) falls in love with a non-feminist lesbian (Sevigny). This, I believe, is certainly the best acting duo of the trio of segments. These two work well together, and Chloe honestly has the best performance of the movie. Her role, as a ""guy dressing"" lesbian is absolutely incredible. Michelle Williams is definitely deserving of credit here - for being able to step outside her Dawson's Creek - and play someone else entirely. I must say I was surprised at her doing a nude scene. Not bad or good, just surprised - something that she might have been shooting for (as per Jessica Biel's Gear nude photoshoot).
The final segment is a bit too quick, and honestly unbelievable. I didn't think there was much chemistry there between Degeneres and Stone (who play a lesbian couple in 2000 trying to have a kid.) Degeneres quickly stepped into her ""Ellen"" role - and Stone seemed arrogant, and slightly aloof. It was definitely the funniest of the three segments, but I enjoyed this the least of the trio.
Overall, the script was very good, and certainly took a good look at what being lesbian has meant throughout the past few decades. Very well acted, very well casted, very well directed, very well written. Great movie.",976579200,28,1606,4.739285714285714

I adore it, makes me cry and laugh and all the stuff a movie is supposed to do, plus Chloe Sevigny (sp??) makes a really really hot manly butch chick.
My only problem with it is the lack of chemistry between Sharon Stone and Ellen.. the ""romance"" in their segment is pretty lame, but the rest of the film is excellent. I'm buying it as soon as it is normal movie price and not 80 dollars! For now, rent and enjoy!",974592000,19,561,4.203703703703703
1353479,5,B00004U104,"In a time where America is on the brink of breaking down the walls of segregation of gays and straights comes a movie that provides not only historical educational insight but also an entertaining and beautiful view of delicate and powerful relationships!  The first story is the most compelling of the three, Vanessa Redgrave gives a performance for the ages as a woman who loses her lover of fifty years only to endure an inappropriate battle with her dead lovers relatives.  Brilliantly executed and directed, it pulls on your heart strings and makes you think just how terribly prejudice people can be for no reason at all.  The second story is set in the confusing and often socialogically brutal early 70's featuring a group of lesbians fighting college campus politics.  Michelle Williams plays a confused young woman who falls for Chloe Sgveny at the opposition of her fellow lesbian friends.  It's not as emotional as the first presentation but it presents a good point on how people take someone too much at face value, losing sight of the soul they were in love with initially.  The third segment is kinda fun to watch simply because Sharon Stone is very relaxed with her role.  Ellen Degeneres doesn't fit the role she plays but I understand why she was in this.  The intensity of the movie fizzles with the last segment unfortunately and doesn't depict as strong of an issue as the first two segments.  Overall, considering this movie makes such a bold statement for homosexuals everywhere, it really makes you think a little bit about how future generations will continue to fight and change the way things are for gays and lesbians-making the world a better place for us all.",974160000,32,1690,4.820069204152249

He is not quite as open minded as I am but I think he could appreciate the overall plot and struggle of homosexuals in their daily life. I thought the role Sharon portrayed was so real, she could have homosexuals overtones herself. This is what great actresses and actors are made of. Sharon Stone is the beast!
