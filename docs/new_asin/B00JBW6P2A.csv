I understand this is an Import (Blu-Ray) but I expected better.
The picture was grainy and movements seemed choppy at times. The audio levels fluctuated frequently.
The concert length was 42 minutes, plus a 1 minute photo gallery, not 60 minutes as listed. Also, audio was edited for profanity.
I've made Standard-Definition DVD burns from VHS that look better than this.
It seems like this was recorded off a broadcast. I saw this concert on Palladia a few years ago and wish I burned a copy then.
""Import"" DVD's are a crapshoot. Rare releases, because they dodge copywrite rules. But quality may suffer.
I hope AC/DC releases an official full length version of this show on Blu-Ray. Currently it's available in the Backtracks Deluxe box set. But, it's out of print and very pricey if you do find it.",1420848000,3,815,4.787234042553192
