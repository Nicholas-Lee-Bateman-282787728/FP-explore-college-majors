5763860,5,B00CZCXQO8,"If you want a real challenge- this is a great workout. Michelle Dozois can give you challenging footwork and make it easy for anyone with her expert cuing. Finally, a DVD that gets your heart rate up enough to give you a good cardio workout. Michelle you're my favorite!",1394236800,3,270,4.530612244897959
5763861,5,B00CZCXQO8,"This is a great interval cardio workout!!  Because of bad knees, I cannot get as airborne on some of the exercises, but I am still able to get a good sweat and good workout.  I like that the participants in the video can't always do the entire workout.  They stop, catch their breath and go slow.  It makes them very believable and makes you not feel so bad about your level of fitness.  Would highly recommend.",1393804800,2,411,4.355263157894737
5763862,5,B00CZCXQO8,"Following the success of the Peak Fit System and its subsequent videos More Cardio Interval Burn and More Cardio Strength, Michelle Dozois now brings us Cardio Interval Burn Remix and Cardio Strength Remix (to be reviewed on an upcoming post).  Like their predecessors, these make great additions to the Peak 10 family of videos.  As mentioned in other reviews, Peak 10 workouts generally follow the following framework:

5-Minute Warm Up

Five training blocks, 10 minutes each, broken down into two repeated 5-minute segments per block.  Each 5-minute segment follows this pattern:

Basecamp  (< minute)  A short recovery time, preparation for the next rise
Initial Ascent (~2 minutes)  Intensity begins to ramp up
Climb (~2 minutes)  Fast-paced, challenging, sometimes uncomfortable, yet still fun
Peak (< minute)  The body is pushed to the maximum effort. Not sustainable for a very long period of time.

5-Minute Cool Down/Stretch

As any first time user should, I previewed the 60-minute video before performing it myself.  If you're not at least somewhat familiar with the choreography, its going to come at you hard and fast. I would also recommend the Movement Review track on the DVD.  This is a convenient way to watch Michelle demonstrating some of the trickier moves in advance. Even after the preview, it took a handful of workouts before I had this one under my feet. Having said that, I am continually amazed and pleased with the movements this routine requires.  Some of the choreography is familiar (e.g., grapevines, repeater knees and hamstring curls), but it seems that with each new segment, Michelle has created step sequences that are utterly original, effective and fun.  She has a new low-stepping lunge that is appropriately called the Groucho Marx Lunge that always puts a smile on my face.  And there is a move that is a sort of Figure 8/Stand Up Paddle/Dig that I love so much, it is the highlight of the entire workout. I even think about this move before I hit play on the recording.

Aside from the great attitude displayed by Michelle and her six enthusiastic cast members, another huge motivating factor in Cardio Interval Burn Remix is the music.  Michelle spends untold hours selecting just the write tunes for her DVDs, and this effort is clearly evident in the soundtrack.  Like music youd hear in a party club, these melodies are incredibly fun and easily get me motivated to get my body moving and leaping off the floor if necessary. There have even been several occasions when Ive heard these songs in my head during the day, before Ive chosen my workout. Like a magnet, this one draws me in, again and again. There is absolutely no dread factor involved, despite the fact that its more than sufficiently challenging. The body is worked intensely, but Im having such fun doing it, I don't mind at all.

No extra equipment is required for Cardio Interval Burn Remix.  Simply clear space in which you can move, and put on comfortable clothes and shoes.  Have a towel and plenty of water standing by.  I promise you, they will come in handy.  I also lower the temperature in the room, as the perceived temperature is going to go up quite a few degrees after you're fully engaged in the workout. Thats one of the things I love about home exercise, as opposed to a gym.  I can control the elementsroom temp is great, and I don't have to worry about rainy days. My biggest challenge as an exercising mother is keeping my little rug rats occupied elsewhere so that I can have the hour to myself.

For you veteran Peakers who are curious about the term Remix in the title: You can rest assured that this is not an indication of recycled video footage from previous workouts.  Every second is new, with the aforementioned new music, set and choreography.  You may recognize a few movements that Michelle has done in other workout videos, but most of them are the kind youd find in many routines. Jumping jacks, mountain climbers, etc. may not be new, but she works them into the brand-new moves in a fun, fresh way.  This DVD has absolutely no recycled feeling to it at all.  The patterns of Basecamp/Ascent/Climb/Peak continue the Peak 10 trend, but thats merely the framework underneath all the innovation.

Cardio Interval Burn Remix once again shows why Michelle Dozois videos are among my favorite workouts.  Her presentation is very motivational, the music and choreography are fun, and my body is pushed to its maximum potential every time I give 100% on my end.  The endorphins produced in my body elevate my mood, even on stressful, frustrating days.  That not only helps my well-being, but it makes me a better wife and mother for my family.  This hour spent on physical training is worth the time and effort, and filling it with Cardio Interval Burn Remix is a great way to do it.",1390003200,11,4823,4.795399515738499
5763863,5,B00CZCXQO8,"I have all of her new videos and I really like them. They are very challenging so you do not get bored. I still can't do the full video! I love her instructions, enthusiasm and the music is great!! I am surprised there are not more reviews on her videos. Tells me not enough people know her yet!",1380412800,,295,4.103448275862069
5763864,5,B00CZCXQO8,Great workout!!  Fun and challenging.  There's no time to be bored or rest too long.  I love the 10 min. segments and Michelle's personality!!  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something new that will leave you dripping with sweat!!,1378166400,,245,4.902439024390244
8587887,4,B00CZCXQO8,"I struggled for a bit with what rating to give this DVD.  In the end, I was weighing complicated choreography and cueing versus how much my heart rate got up.  And I decided that I *did* get a good workout, so I decided to go with a mostly favorable rating.

I actually have a hard time tolerating this DVD for the full 50+ minute interval.  I'm not sure why that is.  I think there is a little boredom involved.  But that is purely on me, and may have to do with the fact that I am getting tired of cardio after doing 75+ minutes of it a day, all year, in an effort to lose weight.  (I've almost lost 40 pounds at this point, so my effort has been successful.)

One other issue may be the organization.  There is a short (3-4 minute) warm up.  It is fine for me.  Then there are 10 interval segments (5 are listed on the DVD menu; the other 5 are repeats of the first 5 but you use the other leg/arm).  Between segments there is a ""base camp"" session which is just a minute or so.  It is a good time to get a drink of water, and I do very much like the actual chance to get water during a workout (some DVDs don't make it easy).  Then there is an ""ascent"" segment, a ""climb"" segment (technically, those words mean the same thing in this context...), and a ""peak"" segment; these are of increasing intensity.  I guess my issue is, you finish one, and you're like, oh goodness, now I have to do 9 more of these?  It just doesn't move as quickly as I would expect.

Then again, this irritation with the organization may be peculiar to me.  On the plus side, I can totally see myself using this for days when I've already done about an hour of cardio and just need something to get an extra 10-20 minutes in.  So even though I don't want to do the whole workout, I can still get value out of the segments and use out of the DVD.

As for the workout itself, I do feel that I got a good workout.  There isn't much downtime at all, and I like that.  The ascent and climb sections are nothing to slouch at.  (I don't know that I found all the peak segments super challenging, but I am quite fit at this point.  Burpees don't even scare me off any longer.)  Perhaps because it was new to me, but I did break a sweat in under 15 minutes.  I didn't have difficulty completing the DVD, but felt challenged.  (If you find it too hard, just do one or two or three of the interval segments and then cool down.  Work your way up to the whole DVD.)

My other beef is with the choreography.  This is far from the worst-choreographed/cued DVD that I've done lately, but I did find myself flailing a few times.  If you have done workouts from The Firm, some of the moves will seem familiar to you.  Like the dreaded ""jazz box"" (though I think the instructor here calls it something else).  If I did not have that background from The Firm, I would've been hopelessly lost.  I picked up *most* of the move sequences after going through the DVD once, but not all of them.  Because the ascent/climb/peak segments are relatively short, you just don't get to go through the choreography enough to really learn it unless you do whole DVD a couple of times.  (Or unless you are really good at picking up dance moves, which I am not.)

Otherwise, I have no complaints.  The instructor seems friendly and she is easy to hear.  The other demonstrators are able to follow along with ease (no flailing from the demonstrators like with Tae Bo workouts...), plus they look fit.  There are two men (who seem a little out of place, to be honest) and a handful of women.  Ms. Dozois knows what she is doing and she doesn't hesitate.  The music is standard workout DVD music, so nothing I recognize.  I pretty much tuned it out, which I tend to do and which is fine for me.  There are no 2-minute-long unskippable promo segments on the DVD (that really only happens with Gaiam productions, I think), which is appreciated.  If you use a fitness tracker, you will get quite a lot of steps from this.

In the end, this does get my heart rate up and is a good workout that can be used in various ways depending on your fitness level.  I will use the DVD whenever I need 10 or 20 extra minutes of cardio (which is still very useful to me) but I probably won't be running through the whole thing all that often.",1476230400,2,4266,4.216316440049444
8587888,5,B00CZCXQO8,Peak 10 is one of my favorite workouts.  Definitely for intermediate/advanced exercisers.  Works up a great sweat!,1471392000,,114,5.647058823529412
8587889,1,B00CZCXQO8,Philosophy sounds great but workout was filled with hard to follow routines that changed every 5 seconds!,1455926400,,105,5.235294117647059
8587890,5,B00CZCXQO8,Love it!,1438560000,,8,3.5
8587891,1,B00CZCXQO8,"I did not like this.  I love fast paced workouts with not a lot of dancing, and this was just too much of too many moves.  I love jari love DVDs: will go back to hers.",1436659200,,167,3.611111111111111
8587892,5,B00CZCXQO8,"This is by far my favorite Peak 10 cardio interval burn of her first 3. Michelle's choregraphy is not complex, however; she moves quickly so it takes a few runs through to get everything down perfectly. Regardless, I still kept up well enough the first time through to get an amazing sweat induced workout. The quick changes between moves keeps me engaged and even though you complete a round on each side, it doesn't feel repetative to me. I also happen to love the peak moves she chose. Michelle is the best at matching music to each move and no need to count- she guaratees each side it worked equally. I absolutely look forward to this workout and have to keep myself from doing it too often!",1432512000,3,696,4.488188976377953
8587893,5,B00CZCXQO8,The hour flies by on this one! I own two other of Michelle's other workout DVD'S (Peak 10 Cardio Strength and More Cardio Strength) and  this one did not feel quite as challenging as the others but you do get a great workout. It combines some basic moves with more advanced moves for an overall interesting and effective workout. I LOVE Michelle's workout and plan on trying more!,1431820800,,380,4.588235294117647
8587894,4,B00CZCXQO8,Very hard to follow for someone not familiar with her workouts,1431302400,,62,4.7272727272727275
8587895,5,B00CZCXQO8,"I first came across Michelle Dozois back in high school when she was part of the instructors who did the Buns of Steel workouts.  I always loved her personality and came across her name in a fitness article which led me to this DVD.  I've done the workout twice now and I highly recommend it.  Michelle still has the same positive, upbeat personality.  This workout lasts an hour, but you don't realize it with all the different segments within each level.  It is a fast paced aerobic style workout, no weights, but you will be sweating within the first 20 minutes.  Love the music, it helps me stay moving when I got tired towards the end of the workout.  Overall rating A.",1401667200,5,674,4.475409836065574
8587896,5,B00CZCXQO8,This is as good as it gets for advanced exercisers totally awesome I am very advanced and I had to pause and take breaks Michelle Duzois workout are the only thing that has completely toned my inner thighs I can wear short shorts,1400198400,,229,4.348837209302325
