8599691,5,B004ZX561G,A well made film telling the terrible story of the Krakatoa volcano eruption and the devastation it made.  I found the characters believable and the story was factual and horrifying for those who lived it.,1489104000,,205,4.857142857142857

8599693,1,B004ZX561G,The video only plays 3/4 of the way through and then freezes up. And if you try to fast forward past the part the freezes up it won't work. The whole last 1/4 freezes up. I do NOT recommend this product,1387238400,6,202,3.951219512195122
