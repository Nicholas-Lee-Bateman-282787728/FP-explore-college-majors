8068762,5,B0009WSOBG,"I remember dancing at 5am in the morning, thinking ""This is crazy!"" as I saw AC Milan collapse to the Liverpool assault. 3-0 up, only to lose 4-2 on penalties, it is surely one of the greatest matches ever seen in football.

About this DVD, it contains all the highlights and goals from Liverpool's matches in Europe (not alot though :P). Worth it, for it captures the drama that led a great club on the brink of oblivion to become the kings of the continent.",1132963200,2,459,4.4
8068763,5,B0009WSOBG,"Love this DVD, Got it from SoccerVideos.com last month, just checked and it is still available there. They will also have the Road To Istanbul DVD that includes the complete final match.",1125446400,,186,4.84375
8068764,5,B0009WSOBG,"I have been a liverpool fan forever. I remember watching them take the league title one after the other in the 70's and some in the 80's. But this past season was a rocky season for Liverpool, but (and a HUGE but) they took the mother of them all the Champions League cup. Not only than but they made me a witness of the greatest final of allllllllllllllllll time. Coming back from 3 goals down and clinching the title was unbelievable. You can't fit every little detail of the season in one DVD, but they sure did try. I liked it so very much, and it is a piece of history that I will keep with me. I so very much recomend it to any liverpool fan.",1125273600,4,648,4.110236220472441
8068765,2,B0009WSOBG,"i don't know if the other ""reviewers"" of this DVD have seen it or not (i have yet to), but the product description states ""including footage"" of the Final.  This is not good enough, it needs to be the whole match, to really experience the pure drama and raw emotion of the game.  i'm sure the DVD is plenty good, but not quite good enough.  I, well, i'll be waiting for the DVD with the whole final on it, complete with interviews etc.  I may well buy this one too, as it is the biggest night of my life as a Liverpool fan ( was too young to remember the European Champions of the late 70's and early 80's.)",1120608000,5,607,4.07563025210084
8068766,5,B0009WSOBG,"I am from England, Liverpool and Lucky for me a Liverpool fan, I know Soccer is Slowly building in Usa.. I can assure you if you had watch the Final Between Ac Milan V Liverpool  (European Cup Final 2005) you would of seen how Thrilling the Match was, The Game was that Exciting you felt like it was an Hollywood Movie. Liverpool being 0-3 Down at Half time and to be fair it could of been 0-5... Then came the Second half and the English Lions Spirit step back onto that pitch... Then it happened the MOst unbelievable Come back EVER... Liverpool Somehow drag them back to 3-3 within 15 Minutes of second half...

After 90 minutes and scores Still level, there was extra 30 minutes extra time... In this time Dudek made a double save, that Could only be save in the Movies...  But Me and MILLIONS Around the world watch as dudek stuck his hands out in front of him and Shevchenko struck the ball from about 4 yards & Somehow it bounced off Dudeks hands and flew over the Bar..!! U got to see it to Believe, Each time I watch it, I get Goose Bumps in my neck expecting it to go in goal...!  I recommend this DVD just to watch final game at the End.... COME ON YOU REDSSSSSSSSSSSSS",1119744000,3,1180,4.254464285714286
