1339104,3,B00004CJY4,"Roger Corman was in the middle of his Edgar Allan Poe/Vincent Price cycle when he took time out to make this low budget but fascinating war movie which takes the same basic plot as The Dirty Dozen and  which appeared in 1964 as opposed to the better known movie which was not made until 1967.

Stewart Granger plays Major Richard Mace ,a British army officer,who is tasked with a mission to rescue an Italian general (Enzo Fermonte)from captivity at the hands of the Germans. He has vital information which the enely must not find out .The mission involves landing behind enemy lines in Dubrovnik ,on the Adriatic sea,and snatching him from his captors

The mission members are all criminals undertaking the job for pardons .There is a sharpshooter (Henry Silva),a former gang leader(Raf Vallone),a dynamite expert (Mickey Rooney),a forger (Ed Byrnes) and an art faker (William Campbell).They are aided by two partisans -Peter Coe and Mia Massini.

There is a neatly executed twist ,revealed at the conclusion of the mission

This is quite a bleak movie and has some sharp dialogue courtesy of screenwriter R Wright Campbell and overall its an exciting B -Movie .It lacks the powerhouse cast and budget of The Dirty Dozen but it well acted by a cast of solid character actors and is worth the time of all war movie lovers .Roger Corman directs -as ever -with pace and panache",1195776000,27,1375,4.834042553191489
1339105,2,B00004CJY4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Nothing makes sense in The Secret Invasion (1964).  Director Roger Corman is out to lunch with the script, but the scenes are shot rather well.  He's managed to scrounge up some decent actors and highly ambitious locale (the city of Dubrovnik, a Croatian city on the Adriatic Sea) but does nothing with them.  He was probably filming five other movies to save money.  Most of the actors are so annoying that you'd wish for their death early on.  They are cardboard thugs, not emphasizing any emotion at all.  Mickey Rooney as Terence Scanlon, Henry Silva as John Durrell and Stewart Granger as Major Richard Mace are just a few found in this stinker.

The Germans aren't much better since they seem to be played by idiotic Slavics and a highly annoying boneheaded commander.  They can't seem to shoot very well either, having great difficulty in killing the idiotic ""Secret Invasion"" force.  The last half just deteriorates so badly that it won't do you any good to watch it.

It's hard to tell what Raf Vallone (Italian footballer and international film actor) is saying with his heavy accent, it's even harder to tell why he's snapping his fingers throughout the film.  The plot is so convoluted that you have to stop just to scratch your head.  These guys take a small boat into German-occupied Yugoslavia and find a graveyard to dig a hole to the big German-occupied castle that has some Italian general.  They dig a few hours, and it must be about two miles to the big German-occupied castle.  Okay, brilliant guys.  Then they get caught and are stuck inside and manage to kill about every German guard inside.  Heck, why not send them to the Italian front to defeat the German divisions?

The ending made no sense at all either.  But that wasn't really surprising.  In all, I guess people who don't appreciate decent war films will love this ridiculous rubbish.  Anyone with a brain will probably go get Hell Is for Heroes (1962), directed by Don Siegel and starring Steve McQueen for the tenth time.",1461542400,2,2048,4.728813559322034

1339108,4,B00004CJY4,"An unusual WWII based film for perennial low budget B film director Roger Corman. This film was entirely shot on location in and around the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia in the former Yugoslavia. This Blu-ray release of the film shows the beautiful scenery and coastal areas used as locations in the film to great effect. This film is very similar in format and plot to the Dirty Dozen but shot in 1964, three years before the Dirty Dozen film was released. Expect some interesting plot twists in this film versus the more linear Dirty Dozen. A few graphic bloody scenes are included so not exactly a G rated film. No language, no sex or nudity. While definitely a B film, with a mostly second string cast to match, this film is none-the-less entertaining and worth seeing. My rating would be 3-1/2 stars, if that were allowed.",1452988800,4,824,4.6506849315068495

1339120,1,B00004CJY4,"Warning spoilers ahead.... Still here? good... now THIS is an awful film. The premise is similar to that of the Dirty Dozen with convicts being used for a secret mission and, yes, this film preceded the DD by a few years. The cast is actually pretty good; familiar faces all and each with a certain amount of charisma -  but they are given NOTHING to work with with here... the weakest link is actually poor Mickey Rooney (love Mickey Rooney but his Irish accent is possibly the worst ever and he is simply too spritely - not to mention the dated Irish streotypes...) That being said the execution of that premise here is dreadful. First, we aren't properly introduced to anyone, we don't get a sense of who they are and therefore we aren't engaged in what they are doing, we have no reason to care about these people... speaking of what they are doing the objective of this ""Secret Invasion"" is muddy to say the least - we aren't given a clear plan as to who will be doing what and why so, again, who cares? Now for my biggest criticism - the plot point where this thing completely lost me... Henry Silva's character at one point accidentally smothers the baby of an underground resistance fighter to avoid getting captured by the Nazi's... why this woman would be engaging in subversive, dangerous and possibly deadly activities while carrying around her infant is a question I won't hazzard to posite an answer for... but here is the kicker - these guys end up SURRENDERING to the Nazi's only a few scenes later... I am pretty much out whenever violence to children becomes a plot point but WHEN IT SERVES NO PURPOSE? come on! I am not a film snob. I can handle low budget b movie fare but NOT when it's just garbage... this had a chance to be a cool men on a mission film BUT they had no story, no script, no characters, pointless action and one of our heroes is a baby killer. This isn't a B movie, this is an F.",1423958400,5,1917,4.4
1339121,3,B00004CJY4,"The Secret Invasion, 1964 film

British Commandos are sent on a secret mission in 1943. They attack an enemy ship and destroy it, then walk ashore to meet the Partisans. Their mission is to rescue an Italian general who is not a Fascist, is beloved by his troops, and can be persuaded to join the Allies. [Switching sides to join the winners is an old custom.] Can the tunnel be dug out in time? One man was caught; will he talk? The approach of soldiers is the answer! Will a crying baby give them away? No! The men flee over the tiled roofs, chased by Germans. It was an accident. Are they trapped? They give up. Another prisoner joins them. Later Major Mace is beaten to make him talk. Another prisoner is chosen for questioning. Then another. One man will be sensible. A hurt man is taken away.

They are able to overpower their guards and get to the captured general and free him. Will he trust them? He is placed on a litter and carried out using impersonation. Will they be caught? Shots are fired, some men fall. Mortars fire on them. [The wounded show blood.] Enemy soldiers fire on them. Are they trapped on the hill? Partisans arrive to fight the German soldiers, who run away! Major Mace walks to mislead the pursuing dogs and soldiers. The others seek refuge in a monastery. Did they rescue the general? Could an impersonator fool the soldiers? One man makes it work! The others speak to the troops and turns them around. More shooting follows, bodies fall. But their mission was accomplished.

This is worth watching for its scenes of Yugoslavia (created after World War One and recently unconsolidated). It is a European movie, its story is different in details from a Hollywood movie. It has American actors like Mickey Rooney and Edd Byrnes (remember him from 77 Sunset Strip?). Stewart Granger is the star. Was this story based on an actual event? Probably not.",1420416000,,1879,4.619760479041916

1339124,3,B00004CJY4,"Predating The Dirty Dozen (1967) by several years, Roger Corman's World War II adventure, The Secret Invasion (1964), features prisoners recruited for a covert operation behind enemy lines.  The rationale for the mission is questionable, and why prisoners were selected is not revealed, however once things get rolling, it is not a bad film.

It's 1943, and British Army Major Richard Mace (Stewart Granger), is in command of a multinational group of prisoners that includes Robert Rocca (Raf Vallone), Terence Scanlon (Mickey Rooney), Simon Fell (Edd Byrnes), Jean Saval (William Campbell), and John Durell (Henry Silva).  Each man has a special skill, but there isn't a lot of time for character development, and things move along rather briskly, and the group is soon in the Balkans, meeting up with a group of partisans.  Mace's group learns they are to free an Italian general being held prisoner by the Germans.  They begin a farfetched plan to dig into a castle used as a prison, but they are captured before they get very far.

The Germans are remarkably patient, torturing the prisoners one by one.  Mace seems to have lost control of the situation, but things change when the prisoners come up with a plan to free the Italian general and escape.  It is remarkably successful, and somehow receives massive partisan support.  A raucous, though disjointed battle on the mountainside takes place.  Most of the team do not survive, but the General is delivered safety.  There is however a twist, that requires one final sacrifice to ultimately make the mission a 'success'.

Although early on the film has some low budget aspects, B-move pioneer Roger Corman (Death Race 2000), makes excellent use of locations in Yugoslavia and Croatia, producing a film that looks quite good, featuring some beautiful scenic shots, including those of the fortress prison and the Mediterranean Sea.  The plot may have flaws, and Corman may not have had a lot of experience staging large scale battle scenes, but The Secret Invasion is a film that fans of World War II action should consider seeing.",1255564800,10,2087,5.0144927536231885

1339126,1,B00004CJY4,"Another horrible war movie which should have never been filmed.  Poor plot, terrible acting, and a disgrace on Mr. Rooney's tremendous film career.  Maybe worth one star but this film is a real STINKER.",1239321600,4,202,4.911764705882353
1339127,3,B00004CJY4,"Although this is no ""Guns of Navarone"", it shares a great deal of similarity with it and ""Dirty Dozen"". It turns out it was released three years before the dozen. Good acting, good story, and beautiful Italian countryside. I still couldn't quite rate it as well as ""Guns of Navarone"", but I like it better than ""Dirty Dozen"". I am certainly glad I had the opportunity to rent it. It certainly deserves at least three and a half stars. A group of prisoners are offered their lifes in exchange for freeing an Italian General from a German prison to help the Allied invasion of Italy. The cast includes Stewart Granger, Mickey Rooney, Henry Silva, Ed Byrnes and Peter Coe. Mickey tries to pull off an Irish accent and although he doesn't quite do it he is still kind of fun watching as he tries to play the part of Irish demolitions expert. The rest the cast are quite good in their roles. Great directing by Roger Corman, decent production values, and good effects. It certainly comes close to making the A list. Overall a decent WWII movie for the whole family.

1339128,4,B00004CJY4,"Three years before The Dirty Dozen was released, director Roger Corman made this movie, The Secret Invasion, dealing with a similar subject although with a much smaller budget.  In Cairo in 1943, five men are brought together by British Major Richard Mace, each of them specialists in their field.  The catch you ask?  They're all convicts with sentences ranging from a few years to immediate execution.  Mace has brought them together to help the Allied invasion of Italy by making the situation in the Balkans easier to handle.  Mace and his convict commandos will attempt to free an Italian general from a German fortress who is suspected of contacting Allied agents.  They hope to break him free and tell his Italian soldiers to fight against, not with, the Germans.  For a low-budget movie, this one packs a wallop with plenty of action.  The build-up can be a little slow, but the last 40 minutes are non-stop action including a running battle up a hill with Germans in hot pursuit.  This movie has finally got a DVD release, so take advantage, it's a lot of fun from beginning to end.

 Part of the movie's enjoyment comes from the cast who all seem to be having a blast making the movie.  Much of the cast is character actors finally given a chance to spread their wings with a meatier role.  Stewart Granger plays Major Mace, the one officer in the group who has an alterior motive on this mission.  Raf Vallone is the real star here as Roberto Rocca, the Mafioso who planned crimes for the mob and will organize the rescue operation.  Mickey Rooney seems to be enjoying himself the most as Terrence Scanlon, a feisty Irishman who fought with the IRA as an explosives expert.  Edd Byrnes plays Simon Fell, the forger who's not convinced he should tag along at all.  Henry Silva is very good in the role of Durrell, a paid assassin with some personal issues we see as the mission progresses. The last of the convicts is William Campbell as Jean Saval, a master of disguise and an impersonator who doesn't trust anybody.  The rest of the cast includes Helmo Kindermann as a German commandant, Spela Rozin as Mila, a partisan woman who bonds with Silva, and Peter Coe as Marko, the resistance leader.

 The recently released DVD unfortunately has no special features, not even a trailer.  But when it comes to fans of the action movie, the important thing is the actual movie and it looks perfect here in a widescreen presentation.  The locations in Yugoslavia benefit the most, and all the colors look pretty good.  You'd never know this movie was released almost 45 years ago.  So for an exciting WWII movie with a strong cast who all seem to be having a good time, check out Roger Corman's The Secret Invasion!",1214956800,7,2719,4.651991614255765

As Fascist Italy is near collapse, this group of infiltrating allied commandoes is sent into Nazi occupied Yugoslavia to provoke an uprising of the Italian troops there against their German allies which would hopefully help the U.S.,Britain and their allies, the Yugoslav partisans in the liberation of Yugoslavia from Hitler.
