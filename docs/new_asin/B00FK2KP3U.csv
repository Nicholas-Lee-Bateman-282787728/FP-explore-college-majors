5994219,4,B00FK2KP3U,"Agree with the other 4 stars.  With the concept it could have quickly gone overboard so  I'd even give it another half star for the easy presentation.  Nothing over the top, not even their respective crazy personality aspects.  Good rom com.  You should enjoy",1491264000,2,259,4.795454545454546

5994225,4,B00FK2KP3U,"Very funny concept, where each character has to put up with constant advice and narration from people inside their head! I thought the acting, overall, was decent and the production values OK. This is not a high budget, glitzy Hollywood film, but it had some nice moments, funny characters and a good message.",1488412800,,309,4.849056603773585
5994226,2,B00FK2KP3U,"I know that 3 stars is supposed to be ""it's Ok"" but I didn't think it quite deserved 3 stars even though I would classify it as ""it's ok"".  It's not a great movie, but it's not entirely horrible either.  The premise is cute in that it has this cast of characters who are the voices in your head who are always having you look at every situation from several different perspectives.  I mean we all have this...the practical side, the young and hopeful side, the selfish driven side, etc.  That part we can all relate to and it's presented in that cute fashion of each of these sides being a person always talking to you.  But the story doesn't have a lot to it past that.  Vivica Fox was good however, my favorite 'voice in the head'. The language is rough; tons of  'F' bombs and sex scenes...this is NOT a family film.  I prefer something more wholesome so be forewarned if that is important to you too.  I couldn't find a rating for it but to me....definitely an 'R'.",1487980800,6,969,4.30939226519337
5994227,5,B00FK2KP3U,"The premise of the movie - that we have different sides to ourselves and these sides conflict and converge to make us act - would be difficult to show on the screen. Not so. It's done brilliantly here.

The two characters each have their own cast of inner thought 'characters' who speak and discuss. The viewers get to know them The main characters move to the background for most of the story just to allow these personified attitudes take center stage. It could have been done badly but it is a skillful display of some scriptwriter's talent. Very enjoyable.

Of course, McCall and Carter are sweet and engaging as a couple. They are fine actors.",1487721600,,648,4.626086956521739

Liked Beth Litttleford's role in the film, funny and hot.",1483228800,,177,4.5625
5994232,5,B00FK2KP3U,"Kudos to Nathan Ives! Although the ultimate outcome is as expected for a romantic comedy, the humor is edgier and utterly delightful.  Dont write this off as a chick flick.  My husband and I both enjoyed watching it.  I think everyone can relate to the many different, often conflicting, voices we hear in our heads, and Mr. Ives brought those to life cleverly and honestly.  The acting in this movie is generally strong across the board, but my favorites were Erick Avari and Ross McCall.  In short, Its Not You, its Me is a more sophisticated romantic comedy than most.",1433548800,,571,4.67
5994233,1,B00FK2KP3U,"I'd skip this very annoying movie.  A romantic comedy is what it is, and IMO for it to be decent, you have to feel some sort of connection to the characters.  Here's the thing, the vast majority of characters who appear in this movie AREN'T REAL.  That's right, they are voices in the heads of the two protagonist's.  This movie could have been a very good movie if it actually dealt with the story of the two main characters and what they were going through.  The problem is 85-90% of the movie are the voices in these characters heads giving cliche commentary given what particualr voice is speaking.  I can't tell you how annoying it was that when every time I was getting interested in seeing what was going to happen, the one guy(voice) would start blabbering about sex or getting laid(all he talked about all movie), or the psychotic voice in a strait jacket would start yelling about smelling a pillow or jumping off a building.  this was the entire movie folks...the main characters were interesting and I would have loved to have seen a fleshed out film seeing them deal with their situation...but it was ruined by the characters(voices) popping up ever minute or so talking a bunch of nonsense and ruining the entire film.  Yeah, I guess it's different...but that's not a good thing.",1430784000,,1293,4.665198237885463

5994238,5,B00FK2KP3U,"This is a quirky and fun romantic comedy. It revolves around the main characters who find themselves battling the voices of their consciousness as they navigate the trials of being in a relationship and making a commitment. Having been in a few myself I felt I could really connect. Overall I think it does a nice job of capturing how crazy and complicated the modern day relationship is. ""It's Not You, It's Me"" is definitely not the same old Hollywood drivel you might come to expect. I highly recommend it.",1411344000,,509,4.666666666666667

5994242,4,B00FK2KP3U,"Saw this indie film at the Breckenridge Film Festival; funny and  tender.  Not your average rom com, has a little more depth.  Well acted and written.  Worth a couple of hours of your time.",1411084800,,189,4.470588235294118

5994247,5,B00FK2KP3U,I watch the movie at Q&A with the director Nathan Ives. I didn't realize until later that he was featured in the film. So not only do I think of highly as a director but an actor as well. The plot was relatable. It shows how complex to human mind is.  I would watch it again and again.,1403222400,,285,3.913793103448276
5994248,3,B00FK2KP3U,"This movie could have been ""MUCH"" better without the ""f"" bombs and bedroom sex...I think the writer could have been more creative with suggestions in the bedrooms.

5994250,5,B00FK2KP3U,"I just viewed this film tonight at an indie screening in Dallas and thoroughly enjoyed it! I really like the format of the interaction --and conflict-- between the 'voices inside the heads' of the main characters. I don't think I've ever seen the male viewpoint of a romantic relationship 'at the crossroads' so well depicted with such humor and poignant understanding. Nathan Ives also does a great job with the female point of view. You'll laugh and then possibly cringe with self-recognition; but, you'll leave hopeful, very hopeful!

I highly recommend giving this film a view; it will provide lots of conversation after!",1401148800,,625,5.067961165048544
5994251,4,B00FK2KP3U,"This film started slowly but picked up with the the introduction of the woman's ""voices.""  I could relate to so much in this film. The male and female voices were spot on, and the online dating suitors were pulled right from my online dating experience. Nathan has an amazing connection to the male and female psyche! A must see for single men and women everywhere!",1401148800,,365,4.615384615384615
5994252,5,B00FK2KP3U,"A well paced film; easy to watch.  Lots of laugh lines.  And for people who like a bit of intellectualism in their comedies, this one does that with lots of interesting characters that will be fun to watch.",1400716800,,206,4.394736842105263
5994253,5,B00FK2KP3U,"This is one of those thought provolking likable films you'll be sucked into.  Life is complicated, and mostly because we make it so.  Making such facts truly funny is the strength of this movie.  Plan to talk with friends after, as you'll find yourselves curious about just how you and your life relate to the movie. Oops, I'm making it sound like a chick flic, and it is.  But any guy who watches more than sports and violence will be entertained, and probably more than a little intrigued.  I'm a male senior citizen who likes sports and (not gratuitous) violence, so I'm not kidding.",1400716800,,586,4.596153846153846

5994258,4,B00FK2KP3U,"A good ""date"" film?  Depends on where you are with your ""intended"".  Very humorous.
If a gal/guy ever wanted to start that conversation about ""commitment"" in a relationship, this would make a great film to view.  Humorous and smart, the film broaches the subject head on.  Could make some people squirm.",1398643200,,303,4.882352941176471

5994260,1,B00FK2KP3U,"Stay away. Just put 3.99 on the trash can. Could not watch it past 10 minutes. It has this strange thing of a bunch of people talking with the main character during the entire movie- inside voices trying to tell him what to do (break up with my girlfriend or not, even though there is really no reason to), including a version of him as a kid which is this annoying kid that cries all the time. These ""inside voices"" are played by horrible actors, but the two main actors are pretty horrible themselves also so you don't even know what's worse. But the trailer shows you nothing about these inside voices talking to him ALL THE TIME which makes the movie UNBEARABLE, it would have been just horrible if it wasn't for that. There is no substance or nothing, main character is a jerk who things he is great and the movies reinforces negative treatment towards women from the society.

That's all I can say without giving too much away! Brilliant writing and direction, great acting, and being from Los Angeles, I loved how the city was represented.",1397779200,,528,4.627659574468085

5994268,5,B00FK2KP3U,"The twist is that the characters actually behave in ways that make sense! The dialog is genuine, the acting is terrific, and you never have those moments of wanting to roll your eyes and the insane actions of the characters. There are many, laugh-out-loud moments, and many more chuckle-out loud lines. Very little man-bashing (or woman-bashing) even while showing the characters working through some very typically male and female relationship issues. Caution: this is not for kids, or even teens. Some very explicit sexual situations.

It is hard to believe this is an independent movie. Only the opening credits seemed at all low budget, and even then the soundtrack was great. The writer/director and his crew must have a great deal of experience, and the actors were top-notch. I saw this at the theater and was really surprised by the quality, and how much it made me think about relationships while being completely entertained. The inner dialog of the main male and female character provide amazing insight into the male and female mind, and also provide the vast majority of the laughs in this movie.

Interesting method of distribution: the writer/director came to the showings throughout the country, much like an author's book signing. He answers questions for the audience and seems committed to independent film-making.",1397088000,,1333,5.166666666666667

I tried to recall the times the words in the title were said to me or even when I had the opportunity of saying them myself.  The movie was tastefully done.  It wasn't over the top romantic.  In fact, at times, it was too real in terms of the raw emotions that come with a break up or letting 'the one' get away.  ""It's Not You, It's Me"" is highly relatable to those of us who've 'been there, done that, got the t-shirt.'",1396828800,,545,4.211538461538462

5994278,5,B00FK2KP3U,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I might have given it an ""8"" but I wanted to counterbalance the ""7's"" it got from reviewers whose words heaped praise on the film yet who's number grades didn't match those words. I laughed a lot during this film. Dave, (Ross McCall) can't commit to buying a Chai latte and so his feeling queasy about staying with his girlfriend isn't all that surprising. It REALLY IS ABOUT HIM since Carrie (Joelle Carter) is just about perfect. What gives the story punch is the committee inside Dave's head who vote on whether or not to dump Carrie. The most vocal is Neil, a misogynistic philanderer who never expresses a tender feeling for anything. He gets the most lines but the others are quite funny as well. There's Dave's inner child, Dave's accountant voice, Dave's morbid fascination with death voice and a pretty blonde female, the only one, who is sensitive and is seeking (for Dave)a meaningful lasting relationship with a good woman. She gets voted down a lot. The way they trade insults is part of the fun. But the negative voices win out and Dave dumps a perfectly good (and also pretty) girlfriend. The movie then splits into what happens to these two characters concentrating more on Dave. Carrie has a series of bad dates the funniest of which is with a man who ""falls"" for her in the first ten minutes. Her reaction, out loud, is to say she's changing her address and phone number and it doesn't even stop him from gushing some more. There's also a Trekkie, and a really self-absorbed Yuppie. Dave goes into therapy and does some delving into his past where the trauma occurred which instigated all his fear. This is glossed over and while there may not have been time to cover it in more detail, the quickness of it made me not believe his transformation that he professes to in the final scene. I didn't want Carrie to believe him because I didn't see enough evidence to support the change. I won't give away the ending but I wound up accepting it. It wasn't the one I expected.

I happen to have this same problem in my own life (fear of falling and committing) and so I had a keen interest in the outcome. I'm not sure I learned from the story but that goes more to the complexity of the problem than the effectiveness of the film. I was impressed with the quality of the production and acting. It didn't have an indie feel, more like a normal Hollywood movie. I hope it gets widely seen.

I should add that Carrie had a committee as well but her ""voices"" weren't as amusing to watch. Perhaps the reason for that was that they didn't strike as many chords that exist out there in the real world. The closest was Carrie's inner child who wanted to be loved and held. There was a woman in a straight jacket who was too over the top, a black chick who was too cold and calculating, and a hippie (male) who was so ephemeral and wispy that there wasn't a single utterance of his that showed even the slightest knowledge of what life is. Being pathetic isn't funny to me. I was missing the biting humor that was frequent in Dave's inner world.",1395360000,,3091,4.467256637168141
5994279,4,B00FK2KP3U,"So,the title is a clich. Sometimes clichs persist around because they happen to be true. I found the story encouraging and uplifting. If only more of us had the courage to be alone and work out our issues,we would do better in relationships. You will see yourself and people you have encountered. Sometimes that's funny. Sometimes that's uncomfortable and eye-opening. Don't expect the typical corny,over the top,pandery(I'm not sure thats a word) type of movie. It is funny,but it's also down to earth which I enjoyed.",1394841600,,519,5.046511627906977
5994280,5,B00FK2KP3U,"After my Netflix binging on series like Dexter and Breaking Bad lately, its was a refreshing change when I sat down to watch the romantic comedy Its Not You, Its Me.

Right off the bat, I couldn't help to think How has no one named a movie this before!? Of all the clich phrases that you hear in the dating world, I had thought they must have all been used up!  But then, as if the bidding wars had finally ended and the most over-used break-up phrase of all times and this movie was released.

The story follows the tale of a Dave (Ross McCall), a commitment-phobe, and Carries (Joelle Carter) relationship and breakup.  But, its not just the story on this movie, its the way its told.  It doesnt just follow the relationship, it analyses every specific characteristic through the two main characters brains interior dialog.  As the story proceeds from a day in the life scene with our characters, it will then shoot to the scene inside their head where different characters representing different aspects of thought.  The characters in their heads battle out ideas that eventually decide our main characters next move. At first, I didn't get it.  But then again, it started from the guys point of view, and we all know my understanding of that particular gender.  His brain was filled with a child, a man consumed with death and a misogynist, among others.  Yep, that seems about right!  When it got to Carries inner thought process, thats where this movie for me, became a lot of fun.  I loved the inner dialog of the characters in her head dealing with the dating world.  What was really funny to me, was that they managed to cover every aspect of the female psyche from a character trying to find reason, the diva who just says Screw it! all the way down to the inner girl in the strait jacket feeling like weve lost our mind completely dealing with our love life!

The story is fun for both guys & girls & told in such a creative way!  I recommend to go check it out on Amazon or iTunes & feel better knowing that we all have a little spicy Vivica Fox inside us.",1394755200,,2068,4.448275862068965

First time I thought it would be good therapy of couples going through a breakup or people who were afraid to commit to marriage. The acting is good and didn't have to rely on music to build the emotion. In fact it is amazing that Nathan Ives could produce a film without using music.  In this case I think music would have taken away from the raw feelings.  The second time I watched it, I became more emotionally involved with the characters.

5994339,4,B00FK2KP3U,"I did like it, but it's definitely not a movie to see with anyone elderly.  My biggest complaint has to do with the character playing the testosterone in the leading male's brain.  There was too much of it.. Too many f-bombs and some 2-on-one sex scene complete with leather and whips.  Did we really need that?  Romantic comedies are usually for women and their dates.  This is one that I suppose will very much appeal to their dates more than the women that take them there.  So, did the character play his role well?  Maybe a little too well.  The beginning of the movie was fraught with more of this than the end.  so, if the women can stick in there, you'll probably like it.  2 people left the theatre before getting to that point.  At least you've been warned!

Again, I did like the film.  And, it's really cool what Nathan is doing.. He's personally going around the US to introduce this movie.  I think  you'll see good things from this man in the future.",1389139200,,965,4.403409090909091

5994343,4,B00FK2KP3U,"While it's not for everyone, I loved how the concept is acknowledged and played out in this film of how we make decisions by listening to the many voices in our heads. The script and actors for those 'head voices' were intelligent, spot on, and hilarious. Like the multi-taskers we've become, I was laughing and soul searching at the same time. Good charisma between main characters and loved this take on creating a 'meaty' romantic comedy.",1389139200,,441,4.815789473684211

5994345,5,B00FK2KP3U,"This is not your typical formulaic romantic comedy. It's very entertaining. The device used throughout the film is the ""Herman's Head"" style inner monologue of the main character, complete with inner child, woman, macho-male, and negative-Nellie. It's about a guy who is a commitment-o-phobe and breaks up with his amazing girlfriend for no good reason.

He then goes on a journey of self-discovery while apart, learning about his problems with relationships in therapy, and fortunately, is able to get back with the girl when he is ready. The girl even leaves an amazing guy that she is dating behind. Throughout the film, the various components of his inner-self are at war with each other, as struggles with decisions.

FYI, my favorite character in the film is the girlfriends ""inner-hippie"", true comic relief.

I highly recommend this independent film. The director is currently on tour in various cities screening it, I highly recommend going to see in person if he happens to be in your city.",1389139200,,1000,5.048484848484849
5994346,5,B00FK2KP3U,"This film exists somewhere in between the rom-com fluff that ties stories up in nice bows at the end in a formulaic way and the dark films that depict human nature as inherently evil...just like REALITY! The ""voices in their heads"" device is laugh out loud funny and the script is really natural and flowing. Good chemistry between the lead actors set in a ""love affair with Los Angeles"" setting, in the way that Woody Allen has you falling in love with NYC in his earlier work. Great character acting by the supporting staff. I've seen it three times since I bought it!",1389139200,,570,4.543689320388349

There are no wild sex scenes, explosions or car wrecks, except for the ones that happen in the walls of our own minds--and the minds of the folks we are trying to love.  This movie helps you see that, and it's funny to boot.  See it with the one you want to love!",1389139200,,420,4.085365853658536

Funny and great dialogue with a look inside what goes on with all the various mind chatter when dealing with life lessons.
Very well done.
I saw it twice at my local Indy theater.
Worth watching!",1389139200,,252,4.270833333333333
5994349,5,B00FK2KP3U,"Loved this film because it's relatable to anyone who's been through the trials and tribulations of dating. The concept of using the inner voices as characters who reveal the thoughts of the two main characters is very cool. Both men and women will find this film entertaining. Oh, and I should mention, the lead actor is a hottie, ladies!",1388880000,,338,4.745762711864407

5994354,4,B00FK2KP3U,Entertaining  and funny look at the things our heads and hearts tell us when confronted with the potential of a serious relationship that could last forever - or not.  Told from two points of view - the guy's and the girl's.  Extra bonus - if you live in LA it is fun to recognize where the scenes were shot!  Download this movie and watch it with your friends! Or your main squeeze if you dare........,1384387200,,402,4.32
8616226,4,B00FK2KP3U,"Really cute! Great for a chick flick with humor. I loved the concept of the main characters' inner thoughts and feelings portrayed through another set of characters. However, these characters were quite cliche, especially the loud black guy as Dave's ""dick"" (come on, can we please stop with the stereotypes!?! Unfair, untrue, and not helpful to society.) Hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, acting was fun and laid-back, scenes moved quickly, and I think the theme was great, the lesson that we can make ourselves better if we choose to, and that love also means forgiveness with a blend of understanding our own past in order to make it work. Spoiler alert: that said, it was a little cliche at the end when she accepts him, but I'm glad at least it wasn't a wedding scene or her saying yes--that would've been unrealistic and too much. Good job!",1527638400,,855,4.706666666666667

Spoiler alert: guy breaks girls heart and as soon as he says he wants her back, she leaps into his arms. The closing scene one of the ""thought"" characters pulls out a wedding ring from his pants. First of all kind of yucky, second of all, tired of movies that have the theme that all a woman really wants is a wedding ring. I think its possible to have a more modern romantic comedy.",1524009600,,477,4.139784946236559
