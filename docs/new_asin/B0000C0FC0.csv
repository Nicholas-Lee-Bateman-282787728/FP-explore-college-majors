1909776,5,B0000C0FC0,This is a great workout! Never boring and very thorough. It's tough enough but not so much that I can't complete it. Emily's enthusiasm is infectious.,1063670400,7,150,4.8076923076923075
1909777,5,B0000C0FC0,"I've owned this workout since it came out and as long as you put in the intensity and continue to increase your weights, you will not outgrow this workout!

1909779,5,B0000C0FC0,"This workout is fun and energizing!  I don't have the bar, but I can do the workout just fine using a few sets of hand weights (3, 5 and 10). I like the way the Firm workouts alternate upper and lower body moves. This shunts the blood back and forth between the upper and lower body, which causes a bigger calorie burn. Again, as with most Emily tapes, cueing could be a little better.",1424390400,2,385,4.202702702702703

1909782,5,B0000C0FC0,"I have 20 ""The Firm"" workouts, this is my favorite by a long shot!
Emily is an excellent instructor, her cuing is good, her enthusiasm pushes you to keep going but doesn't get annoying.
This workout touches EVERY single part of your body, multiple times, and leaves you feeling like no part has been ignored.  The ""Fanny Lifter"" the Firm's high-step, combined with a weighted bar, and 3, 5, and 8 lb dumbbells allow you to customize this workout for any fitness level.  Suzanne, a Firm instructor, guides you through the beginner moves and gets you headed in the right direction.
I have been doing workouts at home for over 25 years and this one is as challenging today as it was the day I bought it SO many years ago.  If you're looking for a good full-body workout that will challenge you for years to come, look no further!",1421971200,7,826,4.493333333333333

1909792,4,B0000C0FC0,"This is actually my ""go-to"" for a harder workout w/ the sculpting stick.  I've been looking for other DVDs w/ the stick, but haven't found one out of the three that came w/ the stick.  Kind of frustrating.  Thought this would be a different one becuase the cover is different, but same one.",1367452800,,290,4.433962264150943
1909793,5,B0000C0FC0,"I actually have owned this DVD workout twice (and traded it for other workout DVDs in the past) yet I keep missing it so much, so I always ""re-buy"". This time I am keeping it once I receive it.

Let me tell you, ALL fitness levels will be able to do this workout! It's easy enough to modify, yet for advance exercisers like me can heavy up on the weights and make this a more harder workout.

Even tho this one is not as tough as the older ""FIRM Classics"" (Vol 1-6 from the 80's), this one still has an old FIRM ""feel"". The workout FLYS by and Emily is very good on leading you through all the moves and segments. I actually saw differences in my body (usually with any workout if you stick to it, you see results in 2-3 weeks). This one I always reach for because it just isn't a workout, but a FUN one. For some reason I just never get board doing this one! It has a great total body workout, but doesn't leave you feeling drained or out of breath when you're finished. Just refreshed and more motivated!

I do not own the sculpting stick (never did), although I DO own the 2 peice fanny lifter (the blue and purple boxes). Instead of the stick I subsitue with 8-10lb dumbells or a 8lb barbell (the barbell alone with NO weight plates on it and works just fine)!

I love that you can make this a nice light cardio/scuplt workout by using only 3-5lbs on some days for the whole entire workout, or you can heavy up for a more ""weight lifting"" workout by using 8-15lbs.

I must keeper!!",1347148800,9,1485,4.196491228070175
1909794,5,B0000C0FC0,I can attest to losing weight from this DVD!! Whenever I've tried anything else nothing provided me with faster results than from using this DVD.

It's a good workout. However, I cannot stand Emily's hyperactive manner and annoying squeeky voice!!  For that reason, I rarely do this workout.  I prefer calm and poised instructors (Tracie Long, Pam Cauthen, for example).",1324944000,2,397,4.695652173913044
1909797,5,B0000C0FC0,"I love this Firm workout.  It's slower paced which is nice but it works your but off!  And it's almost a full 60 minutes so you really get the calorie burn that you need to lose weight and get in shape.  I really like Emily Welsh -- she's a great instructor -- not overbearing at all.  This is a wonderful well-rounded workout.  It makes you feel really good after completing it -- like you have really accomplished something.  And it works -- you will see results after a few weeks.  I would recommend it for any level -- beginning to advanced.  After the insane Turbo Fire workouts -- this is a like a breath of fresh air.  I feel that Turbo Fire is great -- but I also feel it can be a little dangerous (I felt so dizzy after doing the Fire 55 I had to really sit down and get myself calmed down AND I'm an advanced exerciser!!) and should only be done once a week at the most.

1909800,5,B0000C0FC0,"I originally had this one on vhs when I purchased The Firm System II in the summer of 2003. I have this workout on dvd along with the maximum cardio burn. I have been using The FIRM for many years and I am 21 years old now and I have to say this workout is the best one I lose more weight with this one. It's fun she can be a lil annoying with her accent but she's great nonetheless. The only downside is they don't call their products, ""The Firm,"" for nothing I tend to bulk up so I run daily and and I have lovely legs thanks to Emily. If you are going to buy a Firm Video buy this one I sorta dislike many of the other ones that came out like Cardio Dance Express Alison Davis is a weird lady she's too advanced or something I just don't like her.",1299024000,,750,3.8766233766233764
1909801,5,B0000C0FC0,"I have been doing various exercise dvds for years now and found The Firm about 2 years ago.  Since then, I have been doing only The Firm because I like the combination of cardio and weights and I find them challenging, fun, and I like all of the instructors.  I had only used the ""pink"" dvds and saw this one and thought I would check it out.  I didn't have a stair step and had trouble even finding a fanny lifter to buy online.  I picked up a stair step from another maker and it works fine with it. I don't have the stick they use but you could use a broom - I found it more challenging to use nothing for help.  I think this is one of the toughest dvds I have done and I felt it today but in a good way - hams, glutes, and fanny are a tad sore.  Although I had a little confusion with the step cardio section, I really like the stair step - it is really killer and gets your heart going.  I think after I get used to it, I will be fine with the choreography.  I typically do some of my own ab work after I finish most routines but the ab work in this one is the toughest yet.  I could not do another crunch.  Emily is an excellent instructor - very motivating and clear in her cues.  The dvd is longer for The Firm - about an hour but I never got bored.  If you like The Firm or you have a stair step and are looking for something challenging, I highly suggest this dvd.  I liked this so much I found a couple of other Firm step dvds to try out.",1298246400,6,1449,3.871186440677966
1909802,2,B0000C0FC0,"I thought this was actually 5 discs. It's not. It's only 1, plus they want you to have some bar type thing of theirs when you work out. So you have to buy that too.",1297468800,,164,3.7142857142857144

1909805,4,B0000C0FC0,"I've always liked this work-out.  It's a good work-out. Like all Firm videos, the cardio is easy, but other than that I enjoy her lunges, squats, and other moves.",1273190400,,162,4.586206896551724
1909806,5,B0000C0FC0,"Don't normally put in my 2 cents in reviews, but I wanted to up the ratings on this one because it is a great all-around workout. I've been exercising to videos for 17 years, so I'm not a beginner by any means, but I think this workout can be done at any level. It can be a bit on the slower side but that is only because it is important to get your form down; otherwise you are not properly toning your body. Instructor is very encouraging and she hits many muscle groups. If you want to lose weight, mixing cardio moves with weights is the way to go! You cannot go wrong with any of The Firm workouts.",1268352000,3,603,4.07563025210084

I was skeptical to try out a new instructor (Emily Walsh) but i bought the dvd. EMILY ROCKS IT! I love her and this dvd is PERFECT.  I cant say enough about it.  The aerobics are not high impact, they were comfortable to do. She gives the best queing by far of any instructor i have worked with.  Take a chance on this one you won't be sorry!",1263254400,2,467,3.9361702127659575
1909809,5,B0000C0FC0,"I had orginally bought this Set along w/ the Fanny Lifter and the Add-on DVDs when they were first released from infomercials in 2003. It was my second attempt at working in my then apt, Power90 being the first. Even though I was young, 21, with more energy back then and also weighing less, I didn't stick to the system and quit after just 10 days. These sat in my collection now for 6 years and now it's time to see if they hold to the hype of the Firm and their followers.

After approx 5 months off from ALL exercise due to pre-post knee op, I have lost most to all of my endurance and my strength/stamina are quite low. I have decided that being 27 I can no longer afford physically to do the workouts that I had been doing; High Impact and Ultra Heavy weight lifting with Cathe Friedrich and also working with Body Building Trainers. Instead I need to focus on Functional Fitness, Heart health, Muscle strenth/endurance, joint health, and some fat loss. I gained back about 15-17 lbs in that short time and that coupled with the loss of stamina, this DVD kicked my butt all over the place!

I have to admit that I am an Informercial-loving, DVD collecting addict with more than 500 DVDs in my collection. I have often been let down by informercials and/or gimmicky products like we all have. This is one however, that will stand the test of time and produce the results we want if we stick to it and work our way up to the more advanced levels shown. Bc I want to get back into working out regularly SAFELY, I followed most of the Beginner Options, staying low impact, not kicking as high, no weights with Tall Box Climbs/Leg Presses (14 inches), and lowered the amount of weight I would normally reach for. Shoulders I used no weights and used mostly 5 lbs, with 3s for triceps, and 8s for chest, back, and 1 set of biceps. Beginner Option has you using NO Weights for 97% of the lifting exercises, but I needed some challenge as I am well aware of proper form and I knew I could safely and effectively lift the weights for the Weight-Only exercises.

Now just re-reading that statement really shocks me! Here just 6 months ago I doing Dumbbell Chest Presses with 35-40 lbs Dumbbells, Biceps Curls with 27.5 lbs, and Cable Back Rows with 225 lbs; and this Workout with those low weights KICKED MY BUTT!!! I was dripping with sweat, breathless, and my legs were toast during and now after the lower body work. I was unable to complete all of the Leg Presses due to not only being out of shape, but also my knees are still fragile (4 weeks post-op with another surgery in a few months). So when my knees begin to hurt, it's time to stop the motion. I will say though that if you can make it all the way through the leg presses, especially the set with stepping off to the side w/ side leg raises, those will fry your entire leg and butt region, no questions asked! If you have knee issues like myself, do the leg presses with no weights and it makes a world a difference. You can also do them on the 8 inch Blue Platform until your leg muscles are strong enough to take some of the stress off of the knee joint. Doing this workout, I can't imagine that taking very long!

Needless to say, I am very happy with this DVD and along with the other Firms that I own will now be a regular part of my workout rotations. In fact I loved this workout so much that I decided to go out and buy many of the Firm Pinks for days when I want a Hard/Firm workout but something easier on my knees. I am really surprised that this collection has recently been discontinued by many online retailers as it is AMAZING! Get this DVD! I remember that Total Body Sculpt + Abs was a favorite and this one not so much when I first purchased this; this will now be ranked as a favorite. A hard, sweaty, butt-kicking favorite!",1254096000,8,3803,4.307262569832402
1909810,5,B0000C0FC0,"I really enjoy this DVD.  It is a full body workout and a good one at that.  The instructor is really friendly and motivating.  I like that the DVD is strength intervals with cardio in between to keep your heart rate up and burn more calories.

My only complaint about this workout is that the the instructors change positions too fast for me.  While they are already onto the next exercise, I am still setting up.  However, this minor problem can be solved (if you're a slow poke like me) by simply pausing the DVD.  I do not find this a big enough issue to lower the rating.  I really enjoy this workout and feel really good afterwards.

You will need a step box, prefereably one with two levels like the ""fanny lifter"", various dumbbells, and a ""sculpting stick"" or just a weighted bar if that's all you have.",1231286400,,812,4.395973154362416
1909811,5,B0000C0FC0,"I own 30 or so workout videos, and this one is my favorite. I agree with some of the other reviews that this workout, as presented, may be a little much for a total beginner at first- just adjust the # of reps and the weight until you're stronger. No problem. The choreography is easy and enjoyable. Eventually I could do this whole workout and more, in only a few months. You'll be surprised how quickly you progress, if you do this 3 to 4 days a week. I made the investment of the stick and the Fanny Lifter (pretty cheap off eBay) and was very glad I did. Substitutions are fine if you want; but remember a mop or broom weighs next to nothing while the stick weighs 8 pounds, so you're losing resistance if you go that route, and may not see results as quickly. Also, a household stepstool is not going to be safe, IMHO. You've got to be able to put your entire weight on the stool, on one foot sometimes, without worrying about tipping over and injuring yourself. So if you buy only one workout tool, get the Fanny Lifter. Your legs and backside will look great if you use this correctly. It's sturdy and durable and I love it. (One more thing. Watch out for your ceiling fan. Learned that one the hard way.) ;-)

Let's face it, most workout videos have similar moves. There are only so many ways to lift a weight and do cardio in a small space. The reason I love this workout is mainly b/c Emily is such a good leader- likeable, enthusiastic without condescension or over-perkiness, and she tells you what to do next on the last rep of the previous exercise, so you can keep up. That is extremely helpful. Also, I love the music. It is a great motivator to me - if a workout video has cheesy music I won't use it, no matter how effective the exercises are. Of course, everybody's tastes differ, but give this one a try. I have this video to thank for losing 30 pounds and 4 dress sizes within a year. I've bought many newer videos lately to switch it up, but I keep coming back to this one.",1210118400,6,1995,4.25
1909812,3,B0000C0FC0,"I am new to the firm workout series.  I am a runner/martial artist so I usually do these two activities for exercise.  However I have been looking for videos that have some strength training aspects to them to round out my total fitness.  My favorite firm videos so far are Super Body Sculpt and Supercharged Sculpting.  This video was too much aerobic not enough weights.  If you like  the combo of the two activities then it is a decent choice. The ab section was good and the instructor didn't annoy me. However, I thought the use of the sculpting stick was pointless.",1200700800,,571,4.549019607843137
1909813,4,B0000C0FC0,"I would rate this workout as a solid intermediate to low advanced.  I would rate a Cathe Friedrich strength workout as an Advanced.  This is a very fun with no dread factor true AWT workout.  Emily is very personable and cues quite well.  The pace of the workout allows for the exerciser to up the weights.  The reason I find this workout so fun and effective is because it includes a little of everything and at the end I feel as though I've had a good total body workout.  This workout includes some step routines, hi-lo, strength and floorwork.  The variety is very motivating to reach for this time and again.  The music is good. While the set is not as elaborate as The Firm Classics it doesn't take away from the workout.  Everyone looks as if they are enjoying working out and this adds to motivate you to do the same.  Of this series the other workout I also enjoy is Allie's Maximum Cardio Burn.  Both of these are a favorite of mine.",1189296000,2,943,4.362068965517241
1909814,5,B0000C0FC0,"I am startled that some people find this video to easy. I am an advanced cardio exerciser (5 days/ week 40-60 minute sessions) and I follow the advanced Firm rotations. I consider myself to be at an intermediate-advanced shape.

I do NOT have a sculpting stick, I have the TransFIRMer, and I found this video to be very challenging and HEART PUMPING! The trick to any FIRM workout is to really push yourself. Do you think the girls in the videos got so fit and sculpted using 3-8 pound weights? I don't! I busted out this video using 5-20 pound weights.

The heavy 4-limb at the beginning of this workout is 4-limb work at its best. I was truly huffing and puffing. Throughout the workout, any time the instructors used the stick for ""balance"" and held one dumbbell in their hand, I grabbed both dumbbells and really felt the burn.

I loved Emily as an instructor; I thought her cueing in cardio segments was right on. I found her cardio segments to be more fun than other FIRM instructors (I am a huge kickboxing fan). I did find the transitioning to be tough to keep up with, but there is a tiny little button on the DVD played labeled ""pause"" and I am not afraid to use it! I think that being challenged from quickly going from segment to segment when learning a new workout is a good sign, so when you are comfortable with it, there will be less waiting around for explanations.

My only problem with this video is doing chest work on the ground. I usually pull out a stability ball for other FIRM workouts, but Emily combines the chest exercises w/ tricep pushups, which need to be done on the ground.

All in all, this is so far my favorite Cardio + Sculpt workout!",1187827200,5,1671,4.412337662337662

I consider it to be low impact but I am dripping with sweat when I'm finished.  There is very little jumping involved but the workout comes via the step and sculpting stick.  Even the equipment is worth the money.  Emily Welsh does mix up her left and right cues at times, but it's really no big deal.  This Firm workout is one of four that I own and I like all of them.  I sweat hard with all of them and they make me feel like my hour was well spent.  Keep your water bottle and sweat towel close by because you'll barely have time for a sip or a wipe between routines.  The music matches the routine and it all flows perfectly, in my opinion.",1186358400,,762,3.9025974025974026

1909818,5,B0000C0FC0,"Enough people have given this video a glowing review that I probably don't need to add my voice as well ... but in case anyone needs more convincing, buy this video! I own nine Firm videos and this is probably my favorite.

Emily does a fantastic job and this is absolutely one of the hardest Firm videos -- but it's also one of the most fun. More than any other Firm video, this one leaves my muscles (especially the legs) feeling like jello by the end.

Emily keeps things moving along, which is really key, especially since the workout comes in at just over an hour long. Just when you think you can't possibly take more of a certain exercise, she moves you to a new muscle group. Her cardio and step segments are very fun and help the time go by very quickly. This is one video where I feel like it's over not too long after I've begun. The step moves do take some getting used to but I've had a harder time learning moves from other videos (such as the ""box step"" from Allie Delrio's Transfirmer video -- I've given up on ever getting that right and just march in place instead).

A quick word on The Firm in general: I have been doing The Firm off and on for about five years and religiously for the past four months. It is an awesome exercise program and has helped me improve my fitness enormously. It actually is fun, and it's efficient enough that you will see results quickly and thus remain motivated to continue. In the past four months I have made absolutely no dietary changes and yet I have lost almost ten pounds. I think this is especially significant because I have gained a lot of muscle, which weighs more than the fat I have lost.

If you are new to The Firm, expect to not finish a workout the first time through. Just watch the video and walk in place until you are comfortable and then pick it up again. The good news is that a) it works, b) you'll get used to it and be finishing workouts in no time (for me it was less than two weeks), and c) because it's so tough, you can continue using these workouts for months and even years without plateauing. Good luck!",1176076800,9,2087,4.275949367088607

Talk about a good cardio and weightlifting workout. WOW!! I am not what people would consider overweight, by any means, but if you are looking to tone up THIS is the DVD for you.

I have owned Complete Aerobics and Weight Training for almost three years, and I continue to find it challenging. The aerobics portions are fun and invigorating, and the weight training leaves you feeling stronger.

Besides enjoying the FIRM's effective choreography, I find the cuing in this series very easy to follow. The instructors never suddenly throw something new at you. You always have plenty of time to prepare for the next move.

It uses light, medium, and heavy dumbbells, the fanny lifter, and the sculpting stick. Its a cardio + sculpt video. I really enjoy the step aerobics segment. Emily is a great leader. She cues well and she is energetic. This video has an extra long stretching part (i think its about 12 minutes) in the end which is very relaxing and really soothes your muscles after working them so hard in the workout.

1909822,5,B0000C0FC0,"But,now I LOVE it!!!

I had a really hard time figuring out the different moves used  during the Aerobic sections.  So, for awhile, I found myself either marching in place with a lost look on my face, or flying head over spandex off of my fanny lifter.

There's not a single workout video (or dvd) that I've liked, until after I've done it once or twice, so I can get the moves figured out.

However, this one requred a lot more effort, than usual, before I finally reached that golden moment in which I realized that I knew what to do as she called out each movement!  YIPPIE!!!

So yes, I do highly recommend this.  Emily is a wonderful instructor, and I love the choreography she's come up with for this workout. My favorite part is with the punches, kicks and jabs, great fun!  And the music goes great with it!

You may find yourself like I was, and in need of some extra time to learn the moves.  I recommend you keep trying, until you hit that ""A-HA!!!"" moment.  You'll be so glad you did!!!!",1149638400,12,999,4.311827956989247

The sculpting stick was not needed, and the 'fanny lifer' was used to just sit on much of the time when the exercises could have been modified standing or kneeling.

I am extremely disappointed. I wasn't sore or challenged. This might be a good workout for someone who is extremely overweight and needs to go at a slower pace, but anyone looking to drop 5-20 lbs or firm up this isn't for you!",1147305600,12,717,4.303703703703704

I found myself breaking a sweat when the instructor was going through the first 4-limb movement (combination of bicep curls and lunges on the fanny lifter). The whole workout is fun and I love the last sequence with the abs. The chest processes were good, but not the most challenging sequence. The tricep exercise toward the end (right before the ab sequence) is great. I like how she provides us with ways to make the workout easier or harder.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get toned fast! Hope this helps :)",1141689600,6,679,4.520325203252033
1909826,5,B0000C0FC0,"I have had very little experience with The Firm, but lately, I've been enjoying videos that feature aerobic weight training (such as the FitPrime and WHFN series), so I decided to give this a try.  Complete Aerobics and Weight Training is a 58-minute workout which combines cardio segments with cardio/sculpt intervals to give you a great workout; it's led by Emily Welsh.  Equipment used in this workout includes The Firm ""Fanny Lifter,"" a 2-part step (both the full step and the low position are used here), 3 sets of dumbbells, and The Firm ""Sculpting Stick"" (dumbbells can be substituted and/or you can use a wall/mop for balance).

The workout begins with an basic 6.5 minute warm-up that quickly gets the heart pumping, especially with the set of push-ups at the end.  Next comes 4-limbed toning work, combining squats and dips with shoulder presses and bicep curls.  Upper body only work follows, and then it's the first cardio segment, which includes some fun punches and flows nicely from one combination to the next.

More lower body work is next, this time incorporating the bar for balance--you could double up with the weights and forgo the bar, but this section is tough even with it!  The stick is also used as a weight for hover squats, but I just substituted heavy dumbbells, which worked fine.  The next cardio segment uses the low portion of the Fanny Lifter.  Because I don't do step aerobics, I had a little bit of trouble picking up the choreography here, but still, I found the moves to be fun and especially enjoyed the kicks.

Alternating lower and upper work follows with plies and bicep curls.  The stick is again used for balance leg presses with abduction.  There is also triceps work with the french press and triceps kickbacks--the latter set is short, so you probably want to use both arms for the entire set instead of alternating as shown.  The final cardio segment uses the ends of the sculpting stick, or ""twigs,"" but just pick up light weights (I used 3#) and you'll be fine.  Again, the moves are kickboxing-inspired, with punches, side kicks, and a fun little hop move.

The final toning work is on the floor and includes a 1-arm triceps push-up, flies, pullovers, triceps press, and chest press.  The floorwork finishes with a nice abs section that moves quickly through several different crunch variations.  (During this section, I recognized some of the music from the Crunch Fat-Burning Pilates floor segment.)  A nice final stretch is performed mostly on the floor; Emily is thorough, but none of the stretches are held very long (although I did really enjoy the final neck stretch!).  I felt great at the end of this workout--nicely worked out, but not exhausted--and I was pleased to see on my heart rate monitor that I had stayed in my target zone for a full 40 minutes PLUS had burned 341 calories.

Although one of the background exercisers shows modifications throughout, I wouldn't recommend this video to absolute beginners who are unfamiliar with weight training.  However, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to more experienced beginners to intermediates looking for a fun, effective routine.  I really enjoyed this workout and know that I will use it often; I will be looking to try other Firms as well.",1141430400,63,3259,4.844765342960288

This video is challenging and fun.  It is tough and definitely a good workout overall.  Each exercise transitions well into another.  The cardio is fun that includes a bit of kickboxing.  The weight training is more intense than The Firm 1.  I highly recommend this video.  I have always enjoy The Firm exercise video.  The only setback is, everytime The Firm comes out new videos, you are required to purchase a new equipment for their new workouts.",1137715200,7,603,4.666666666666667
1909828,4,B0000C0FC0,"This was one of the first The Firm workouts I bought.

I was disappointed with the warm up, I don't think even now that she does enough on this, especially with the amount of climbing and squatting that is done. I just learned to do alittel additional stretching beforte I started.

That said, the rest of the workout is pretty good. She transitions well from one move to another (some of the other video's it seems you aren't quite where you need to be for the next sequence, or you just aren't where you need to be) giving it a pretty good flow. She alternates upper and lower body with aerobics making it fun to do.

If the warm up isn't great the cool down and stretch is one of the best and I incorporate some of the stretches into other video's. I still use this workout even though I have others that are newer. My biggest complaint about the Firm is that for every new video I buy I have to get a new piece of equipment, I wish they would incorporate some of their old equipment into new workouts.",1137110400,6,1005,4.2513089005235605

Emily Welsh is a great instructor, she is cute, and has a positive motivating energy about her.  Emily is amazing the way she can continue to instruct throughout the abdominal exercises.

Anybody who says this video doesn't have a warm-up obviously didn't get past the first 15 minutes.  If you get discouraged with the steps, keep trying!  The steps become way easier and a lot of fun if you stick with it.

I don't have a sculpting stick (bought the video at a used books store), and I think it's probably more for beginners or those with weak knees. I do the whole video start to finish without the stick and I've had no problems and still get a great workout.  No, it's not a beginner's video, but you can always follow the exerciser doing modified beginner moves to start with.

Also, if you do not have ""The Firm"" equipment you can modify.  I use a stick as a sculpting stick, I have 4 sets of weights and I bought a step stool at a department store.  You can also intensify or lessen the weights for more or less of a work out.

1909835,4,B0000C0FC0,"The is the one and only Firm video led by Emily Welsh, which is part of the Firm's second Body Sculpting System which introduces the Firm's Sculpting stick. The stick is a 3-1 body bar that weighs about 8 or 9 lbs. The ends are removable which they refer to as ""twigs"" which are 2lb light weights used for resistance, the stick fully assembled is used for balance and stability. If you do not have the stick a broom or mop handle will do just fine. The video also uses the Fanny Lifter, but again a regular step would work for the aerobic routines and a stool would be fine for the leg presses. Finally you will need a few sets of dumbells, 3, 5 and 8 lbs are recommended by Emily.

This is an aerobic weight training workout, alternating strength and cardio segments. Some of the strength segments consist of compound movements, where you work upper and lower body at the same time, lighter weights are best for these sections. Some of these include squats with overhead presses, dips with bicep curls, and plies with bicep curls. The sculpting stick is used quite a bit in the video, for balance mainly but also allows you greater range of motion in some of the moves. You hold the stick in one hand and a weight in the other for squats, lunges, and leg presses. There is also a set of unweighted squats that utilize the stick as well. As you get stronger some may find they don't need the stick, which is fine too. For upper body you will see bicep curls, french presses, single and double arm lat rows, etc.  All of the muscle groups are covered well.

Alternating with the strength segments are some fun cardio routines, one being lower impact with step taps along with some punches and jabs, low jacks etc, another segment that uses part of the fanny lifter for step aerobics, and a 4 limb section using the ""twigs"" for some shoulder work and some kickboxing moves. A tough ab section ends the workout before a well deserved cooldown and stretch.

Emily does a good job in this video, she is motivating, energetic and looks like she is having a great time. This is a good workout with a nice variety. I recommend it.",1112486400,11,2122,4.433333333333334
1909836,5,B0000C0FC0,"For this series (one of three), a 14"" ""fanny lifter"", sculpting ""stick"" and dumbbells are recommended. However, you can use just dumbbells and a regular aerobic step with an old broom handle (that's what I do)! This is a fun workout; it's got weight training, cardio, and lots of variety. I am 48 years old and have been doing the Firm since the first one came out in the late 80's. Truthfully, I have a tight, toned body that everyone says looks no older than 35. If you do these videos, you WILL get results.

This starts by by warming up with Fanny Lifter, then launches into weight work that alernates upper and lower body exercises, a technique called PHA (peripheral heart action) training that burns more calories by forcing the heart to pump between distant muscle groups. Cardio intervals are interspersed throughout, everthing from kickboxing to step aerobics. Then it's time to hit the floor for upper body work and an abdominal section that will change your mind about ab work! The stretch is long, relaxing, and complete- a great finish! This workout is about an hour long.",1111795200,3,1086,4.746031746031746

You will tone all parts of your body while getting a cardio workout. There is a lot of variety in this workout;step aerobics, kickboxing, and low impact aerobics are alternated with sculpting segments.

I like the pace and I like the moves.  The lunges are effective, but a little softer on the knees than the heavy-weight, deep-knee lunges of the original Firm tapes.

Also, I think it's important to have a good warm up before getting into any workout and you won't find that here. I also found it very annoying the way you have to keep moving your fanny lifter, sculpting stick and weights out of the way as the segments change. It completely interrupts the workout.

I like all three tapes in the system, but this one is my favorite.  Emily is a very sweet instructor who explains movements and add-ons very well.  She's also very motivating without overdoing it and annoying you.  The only problem I found, which isn't actually a problem, is I am not very coordinated when using new tapes, so I found the second aerobics interval a bit hard to follow the first few times I used the tape.  I like that the three aerobic intervals are spaced nicely so you don't feel too pooped out.  As I said before, I love this entire system, and you will definitely feel positive changes early on if you use the system faithfully, but I like this tape the best out of the three as I feel I have worked out every muscle in my body when I'm finished and if you stretch properly at the end, you will not be sore.  I would suggest however if you haven't been doing ab work regularly, to follow the instructor showing the beginner movements.  I no longer follow the beginner through the rest of the workout, but the ab work I still do, so don't push yourself too hard!!  Enjoy the workout and love your results!!  I'm keeping track of my results to submit a testimonial to The Firm a few months down the road.  That's how good these will work if you make a concerted effort to be healthier.",1076716800,9,1429,4.334586466165414
1909855,5,B0000C0FC0,"You're gonna sweat with this video. It's just excelent. I don't know how she does it but she doesn't hesitate to explain every single excersice, even when she's doing them herself. It's good for beginners 'cause it shows how your can start doing the excersice and go on to the next level. I just hope you have fun with it.",1076544000,2,322,4.383333333333334
1909856,4,B0000C0FC0,"This DVD is fun and CRAZY!!! Workout moves really fast so I have to be on your toes...or have the ""pause"" buttom ready to stop and setup. I did the program yesterday for the first time following the beginner instructor and today my thighs and inner thighs are a tad sore....which is good...it was what I was wanting. The only negative thing I can say is that the decription of the DVD both on the packaging and on Amazon does not tell you that you need a Sculpting Stick and preferably the Firm's Butt-Blaster steps which are taller than normal steps. I had to run out and purchase these items after starting the DVD and realizing I didn't have them. They also ask for 3#, 5# and 8# weights. Luckily I had those, even though the beginners some times do not use them at all. So, make sure you have these items. The cost was low, but I still had to make a trip to go buy them. ENJOY...this workout is the cardio/muscle sculpting tool I've been looking for. Plus, you don't need alot of space. KUDOS!",1076284800,11,997,4.336898395721925
1909857,5,B0000C0FC0,"This video has it all!  I am intermediate to advanced and got a real challenge out of this workout.  The workout effectively combines strength training and cardio focusing on both the upper and lower body.  The instructor is really good - I like her encouraging remarks, ""you look great"", it makes you feel like you have your own personal trainer in the room with you.  Another plus is that the cardio sections are not overly complicated - for us not so coordinated folks.  My only complaint - as it seems to be with all Firm videos - is that you switch from one set of exercises to the next very quickly - so you need to have your equipment handy, but I always find that after doing the video a few times staying on pace is not a problem.  Lastly, and most importantly, the workout is fun and enjoyable which means if you buy it you will probably actually want to do it.  Hope this helps.",1075161600,6,889,4.319277108433735
1909858,5,B0000C0FC0,"I agree will all of the positive reviews.  I love this workout.  You can always add more weight to make the workout harder.  I use 10 pound ankle weights during parts of it as well.  This makes it much more challenging. I have also found that straping my ankle weights to the sculpting stick works GREAT for floor work.
This workout is the best in the Sculpting System 2 group, but I really like them all.  The whole kit is expensive, but the cost is so worth it.  It really works and it is much cheaper and better than a gym membership. I do one workout each day and my fanny REALLY is firmer.  The Fanny Lifter is wonderful.  I thought that it was a waste and that any step would work.  It is not true.  I have been working out with a shorter step for a while without great results to my rear-end, but, now that I am using the Fanny Lifter, I am getting much firmer and starting to really look good!!!  Get the whole Sculpting System 2 three tape group, get the fanny lifter and workout every day.  Your shape will change!
One more comment - The whole system is wonderful for beginners as well.  One person on each of the Sculpting System 2 videos does the whole workout modified for beginners.",1073606400,10,1196,4.262222222222222

1909860,4,B0000C0FC0,"After using the The Firm Body Building System with the Fanny Lifter,to add variety I purchased the The Firm's Body Building System I with the Sculpting Stick. System II contains three videos (Total Sculpt plus Abs, Complete Aerobics & Weight Training, and Maximum Cardio Abs) and stick only. I've tried each of the workouts several times and found the routines to be very similar to the original System routines, except it used the stick to provide stability or give a little more resistance. Because I'm short, the stick gave me more stability when doing the exercises that required me to step up on the 14"" Fanny Lifter. Using the stick for stability also allowed me to do deeper squats. I found the Lift & Hover Squats to be a bit more challenging, because I wasn't use to having anything spread along my shoulders. After my first workout, I could feel the more intense workout throughout my hips, thighs, and calves.
There are several exercises in the Total Sculpt plus Abs video and Complete Aerobics & Weight Training video that requires the stick to be disassembled to use the ends as 1 lb hand weights. After several workouts, I found the disassembling of the stick was not worth my time, since the 1 lb was like working empty-handed. I now use my lightest dumbbells during this segment of the routine.
Overall, I found the stick to be an excellent source of stability, but other workout sticks can be purchased at a much cheaper price or simply use the stick from a broom or mop. I still think The Firm gives a good workout with great benefits and quick results, but it's Fanny Lifter that remains the key to an individual's success.
For the best workout at a cheapest price, if you're an original Firm user purchase this video and use a household broomstick. Those new to The Firm can purchase an entire system containing the Fanny Lifter and the Stick. Because the workout helps me to get tone and sculpt, it still deserves 4 stars.",1070582400,30,1943,4.651162790697675

This workout is fun, challenging and rewarding! Definitely (like they say) after 10 workouts I noticed a difference in my body. The pace of the workout is easy but effective. And I really like Emily. She is thorough in explaining exercises and keeps you motivated! You have to get this workout - expecially if you are tired of all the other workouts you have at home now. I can't say enough - I love it!",1070323200,14,551,4.257142857142857
1909862,5,B0000C0FC0,"I consider myself an intermediate to advanced exerciser and have been doing The Firm for a few months now and LOVE THIS. I borrowed the BBS 2 from a friend but from the 3 workouts, this was my fave so I bought it separately.  It really is the classic combination of aerobics then weights then aerobics which is what I look for. I loved the kickboxing moves and the slightly different use of the fanny lifter with legs out to the side - a nice twist on the typical up down move.  I was sweating within the first 10 mins, getting a thorough workout. A fantastic ab section too. Definitely one of my favourites.",1069113600,15,608,4.324561403508772
1909863,5,B0000C0FC0,"I have been using the firm for 2 years and this is the absolute best video they have made. Emily makes the video fun and easy to follow. She switches from weights to cardio a few times and then to the arms and abs. It is a great one hour workout and I recommend this video to people who need that extra visible result they have been looking for, this one covers all the bases. Don't forget to purchase your firm fanny lifter and sculpting stick, you need 3, 5 and 8 pound dumb bells. The firm by far is a great program for me and I hope that you give any firm video a try because it's great for your heart and their cardio routines are fun, the fanny lifter makes you work your thighs and butt it's really a great system I actually recommend the whole program, hoping that it will work for you.",1068595200,6,794,4.096153846153846

This video was my fave from the collection, and I lost a ton of weight on it. I used it religiously for years alternating days between Firm workouts and hour-long walks.  It kept me lean and strong and in the best shape of my life for many years.  As others have mentioned, you DO need the fanny lifter and sculpting stick for these or something comparable to use in their place.  After a few years' absence, I'm hoping to return to this workout.

7998075,4,B0000C0FC0,"Great work out! Great pacing too.  Not too danc'y either since I have 2 left feet. I love programs that includes both cardio and strength trading with weights. Perfect for beginners. But I'm more advanced so had to modify some things for a couple of reasons to get a truly effective workout. I 1. I don't have the weighted bar they use but I do have a 9lb body bar which is basically the same thing. That said I stopped using it since I thought it took away from the exercise. Unless you have real balance concerns and need the support, don't use it. I found I was inclined to lean on it which took away the effort I should be applying towards balance/control and power used in the legs. I have light hand weights for the kickboxing session at the end where they have you disassemble that sculpting stick down to two lb weights. It did take some getting used to which weights I needed for those segments to push myself, but eventually I found a formula that worked. For me that was 15s, 10s, 8s, and them 3s for the kick boxing. 2. I don't have the fanny lifter. So I used my regular step turned long ways since none of the moves had me go in front. But after I did the workout a few times I just used my rubber-made brand stow and step tool container that is basically the same size as the lifter (~1/2 inch shorter). Perfect. I like the setting for the workout, fairly timeless with clean lines, non descript outfits, and good camera work. The 4 vs 5 stars is because the instructor was ok at queuing but lacked some enthusiasm, very monotonous. Felt really scripted. Music seems a little slow too. I'm looking for something a little more motivating. Also, Im used to more instructions on getting good form on moves, that feels lacking here. However, I will continue to use the program. Glad I purchased. It's nice to feel ahead of the curve and more advanced sometimes with workouts.",1489622400,,1886,4.404011461318052

A very good work out and one I've been using for over 5 years.  Remember to keep your back pressed against the floor during the floor dumb bell lifts.  This tape is fast paced - little down time between exercises - and the Firm isn't always the best in describing proper form.  Especially in weight lifting.",1476748800,,466,4.435294117647059
