I do not think there are any actors in the movies today who can ""act"" without words or swearing. Like Gloria Swanson said in Sunset Blvd, ""We didn't need dialogue, we had faces."" Valentino had the face AND the acting. He would have made the transition into talkies as he had a nice baritone voice that matched his dark and handsome looks.

If you really like to watch acting, you will like all of Valentino's movies. ""The Son of the Sheik"" was wonderful due to his duel acting role as his own father and the chemistry with Vilma Banky. It is just beautiful. ""The Eagle"" with Vilma Banky was wonderful too. ""Four Horsemen"" was also wonderful. ""The Married Virgin"" was great.

It is a nice trip back in time to spend quiet evenings with Valentino and to immerse yourself in his acting. Watch how he uses his body language, his hands, his face, his smile, his smirk, his sparkling laughing eyes and his famous seductive smoldering eyes to convey his emotions. Valentino will pull you in and mesmerize you without saying a single word! Sigh. We are missing so much in today's movies.",1350345600,8,1232,4.621004566210046
