8377270,1,B002PQT21A,"Strictly for beginners.  Way too much time spent on too few techniques.  For example, one technique was shown 83 times by four fighters after Mr Franco demonstrated it.  Kicks were barely mentioned and were not part of the sparring demonstrations. The last 15-20 minutes were used to advertise Mr. Franco's other DVDs.  If one has several hundred dollars to spend on all of his DVDs, I believe that one can learn a lot.",1419811200,,419,4.698630136986301
8377271,5,B002PQT21A,"In this DVD, Sammy teaches you straightforward tricks to beat your sparring partner. As he explains, not all of these techniques are applicable in a street fight. However, if you're a beginner at sparring, you are constantly in ""survival"" mode and don't learn very much. ""Sparring"" teaches you how to level the playing field to allow you to learn from your sparring sessions.",1415232000,,375,4.968253968253968
8377272,5,B002PQT21A,Great DVD arrived on time and had the quality I was promised. Thank you for your item and fast service.,1326067200,,103,4.2
8377273,5,B002PQT21A,The tips and techniques in this DVD will take your sparring to a whole new level.  It is a must for any martial artist's collection.,1255996800,,132,4.28
8377274,5,B002PQT21A,"I've been looking forward to a DVD on sparring for ages, and this is now on my list of favorites by Sammy Franco.  If you've ever sparred with a more formidable opponent, you already know why, too.  Unless you're a boxer, you don't spar for the sake of sparring.  You spar in order to learn and benefit from the skills and attributes you can improve that will make you a better fighter.  But like Mr. Franco says in the DVD, when you're a beginner or if you're sparring with someone more advanced than you, you go into ""survival mode"".  You defend as much as possible, try to land a few hits every now and then, and hope for the best.  You don't learn much, frankly.  But it doesn't have to be that way.

This DVD will teach you the skills you need in order to start learning and to ultimately dominate your sparring partners.  You will feel more confident and wonder how it is you ever sparred without these techniques in your arsenal.  Oh... and you will LOVE the ""steamroller"" and ""cover & crush"" techniques!",1255305600,2,1011,4.416216216216216
8377275,5,B002PQT21A,"This DVD tuition should be in all fight training regimes. If you are a beginner, then you MUST have this no-nonsense DVD. I wish I had these approaches when I was starting out, as I would've hit the ring running.
For intermediate trainees, this will fill any gaps in your sparring, and for the advanced fighter... there are techniques here that can be added to your growing skill base, without a doubt.

There is never an end to learning, and I especially enjoyed the ""Steam Roller"", and will be using it from now on.
I use a variation of the ""Bait and Smash Technique"" already, and it was good to see it presented to the masses for sparring!

My sparring has now taken on a more varied and technical flow, and am already seeing the benefits in sparring... and a more cautious partner (and myself, as well).

Thanks Sammy & CFA, for giving me more tools, with which to perfect my training goals.",1254960000,3,895,4.478527607361963
