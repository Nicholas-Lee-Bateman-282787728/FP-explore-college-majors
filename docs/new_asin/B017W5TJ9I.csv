7535801,5,B017W5TJ9I,"The Adventures of Gumby, the 60s series
Samantha Alexander 12 years

This is a very enjoyable and fun claymation series that is about a green humanoid character named Gumby and his side-kick and best friend Pokey. They go on wacky adventures throughout all the episodes. Some of my favorite episodes are The Zoops, The Glob, Santa Witch, and Hidden Valley. There are lots of other great episodes in this series as well, but these really stand out.

Something I immediately noticed about this series is that the animation isn't like any film series you see made today. It is a clay animated show. This type of animation is particularly interesting because, they photograph each movement the characters make. The animation process is described in the bonus features. This show is also very creative. I watched the episodes and was amazed. I often wondered how they came up with these ideas. From the punch lines to the plot lines of each and every episode, it is fun and unusual.

The bonus features on this DVD disc are something special. They included behind the scene footage, a photo gallery from making the series, the first aired pilot episode with sound and a very rare episode called space ball. I love that they includes photos because it gives you an inside look at what was happening when they animated and it makes you feel connected to the show even more. Also, getting an exclusive look at never before seen special episodes is very cool because, while watching them, I kept thinking about how rare they are.

I recommend this series for ages 5 to 18 because they are classic films that anyone can enjoy and they first aired over 60 years ago so this disc is perfect for anyone who grew up with Gumby and would like to see him in action again. I give this series 5 out of 5 stars because they are fun episodes that anyone can enjoy and the animation is interesting. Also, seeing the bonus features on the disc make a it much more enjoyable because I knew what went into making this classic show.

7535802,4,B017W5TJ9I,"It is great that these chronological Gumby sets are being released. Over the years, I've collected all the 1980's VHS releases by Family Home Entertainment. My VHS collection accounted for all but 3 episodes from the 1950's and 1960's Gumby series. I was excited to hear that these episodes were not only being released on DVD, but are all-new restored transfers. That means that I can finally retire my Gumby VHS collection, right? Nope. If I want my collection to be complete, I will need to hold onto a few of the VHS tapes until further notice because it appears there is a short list of episodes that are intentionally being skipped over. Read on as I explain what I mean by that.

The episidoes on this set simply go off the order they are listed on the official Gumby website. When I bought the set, I looked at the episode listing and noticed something that seemed to be off. The last 3 episodes on this set are ""Pilgrims on the Rocks"", ""Son of Liberty"" and ""Gumby Crosses the Delaware"". I knew that ""Pokey's Price"" should've been between ""Pilgrims on the Rocks"" and ""Son of Liberty"", but it is not there. I then compared the listing on this set to the listing on the Gumby website to see if any other episodes are missing and indeed there is another one that is. The other missing episode is ""Siege of Boonesborough"", which should fall between ""Tricky Train"" and ""The Missile-Bird"".

Some may ask why I am making such a big deal about two episodes not being on this set since this is a ""Volume 1"" and they may appear on ""Volume 2"". The fact of the matter is, if these two episodes appear on ""Volume 2"", then they are now releasing them out of order. These episodes were probably intentionally skipped over because of politically incorrect content that is contained within them. Both, ""Siege of Boonesborough"" and ""Pokey's Price"" stereotype Native Americans in an unflattering way. It was common for these stereotypes to exist in children's cartoons back in the 1960's. I understand the reason why these episodes were left off, but I also believe that it is wrong to apply censorship. The right thing to do would be to include these episodes on the set and provide a disclaimer such as ""These episodes are products of a time when racial sterotypes were comonplace in American society. While these views are considered wrong in today's society, it would also be wrong to censor these works of art and pretend such stereotypes never existed"". A disclaimer such as this has commonly been used by Warner Bros. on their DVD releases of ""Looney Tunes"" and ""Tom & Jerry"", so why not use it here?

Aside from the missing episodes (which may or may not be on a future release), this is still a very solid purchase for anyone, whether you want to relive childhood memories watching Gumby, or introduce Gumby to a new generation. Most episodes on this set are indeed newly restored transfers. The only episode that is not a new transfer is ""The Missile-Bird"", but since it is the same one that video-on-demand services Kabillion and Ameba have used, a restored version might not exist (yet).

The bonus materials also make this set worth the purchase. We finally get a complete version of the original 1950's pilot film with audio. We also get the complete version of ""Space Ball"" with its original soundtrack. The ""Behind the Scenes"" feature is nice, but leaves more to be desired. Perhaps there is some more home movies in the Clokey vault that are being saved for ""1960's Volume 2"".

Overall, I give this set a 4 out of 5. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because of the two missing episodes. But still, this set is a solid purchase and I do indeed recommend it as well as the 1950's set and all future volumes.",1457136000,20,3714,4.604229607250756
7535803,5,B017W5TJ9I,"This is the stunning second volume of chronological episodes in the Claymation masterpiece known as GUMBY.  Creator Art Clokey has yet again outdone himself here, and these are indeed the original soundtracks.  Even better on this volume are the special featuers, including a pilot episode in which Gumby sings a little song about himself vastly different from the more familiar theme that you'll also finally hear on this series of collections.  And there is a special edition of the volume here, this time with a POKEY figure.  The transfers are stunning and the individual episodes are surreal and interesting.  I cannot wait to get a third volume, perhaps finishing out the 1960's collection!

This collection also includes the three shorts featuring characters called RODGY AND HANK, a bird and bear team that also go on adventures by entering books.  Dallas McKennan shines as the man of 100 voices for this series, along with Art Clokey himself.  Gumby is everything in this stunning volume, from a hot rod racer to a knight in shining armor, saving a kingdom from a fierce dragon who has no control over its firey onslaught.

This and the previous volume, spotlighting the complete 1950's series, is indeed a labor of love, and it belongs in any classic animation collection!",1456876800,5,1283,4.985915492957746

The next installment of the 1960's Gumby Show will occur on September 13th, 2016, according to an e-mail response from the NCircle website (the DVD publisher). I can't wait to pre-order the next DVD. Perhaps someone at Amazon can accomedate, better sooner than later, this time ???  If they could only publish the complete series runs of: Felix The Cat, Hercules, Sinbad Junior, and Space Angel from the 1960's too. The early ""BIRD"" gets the worm :) :) :)

These episodes are ""Siege of Boonesborough"", ""Pokey's Price"", ""Gold Rush Gumby"", ""Indian Country"" and ""The Indian Challenge"". Us fans want to see those as well!!! They are a part of history which even Whoopie Goldberg said should be shown despite what may, or may not be said about them. Other cartoons have been released (Popeyes ""Scrap the Japs"", ""Your a Sap Mr Jap"", plus other cartoons series). Not sure why you would omit these. Its not a complete collection without them.

7535830,5,B017W5TJ9I,"Although I was a child of the late 80s/early 90s, Gumby was still a part of my childhood growing up, thanks to re-runs. So when I discovered the old cartoon was getting released on DVD, I knew I had to have it. And popping in just one of the two discs instantly brought back a ton of memories for me.

I'm sure everyone in the world has seen at least one Gumby cartoon at some point, but for the un-initiated, Gumby is a young boy made out of clay, who lives with his mom and dad in a timeless fantasy world where anything is possible. Along with his best friend, a red/orange horse named Pokey, he spends his time exploring the world; helping the various characters he meets, and having adventures; many of them via literally jumping into books in the library. From Toyland, to the Old West, to outer space, every episode is only limited by your imagination!

This DVD release is pretty nicely put together, with all the episodes unedited, and cleaned up to today's standards of picture quality. There's a few issues with the overall picture and sound, depending on the episode, but considering how old this series is, it's to be expected. That's a fault of the age, not the DVD. After loving the first DVD set of all the 50's shorts, we now get into the 60s, and finally see the introduction of Goo, Professor Kapp, and Prickle the dinosaur. . All the included episodes are cute, innocent, and charming; sometimes teaching valuable lessons--other times just taking the viewer on a surreal experience. But simply put, they don't make cartoons like this anymore.

The special features are fairly cut and dry. Included is the first aired pilot that introduces us to Gumby and how his world works (and the animation is pretty rough compared to the later years), ""Space Ball""--a rare episode that introduces Professor Kapp, a photo gallery, and a quick ""behind the scenes"" featurette that's actually just a few home movies of Art Clokey in the filming studio. I was still expecting there to be something about him and his life, or some other behind the scenes of how he created Gumby. But considering the dry release of the previous DVD set, the features this time around are a bit of an improvement.  And as a bonus, you also get a bendable figure of Pokey!

If you loved (and still love) Gumby, this is a must have set to get. And even if you're a brand new viewer, you can dive into any episode and not be lost. In comparison to today's television, which seems to have fast paced shows with nothing but talking, this series is far more quiet and laid back in it's delivery, and allows the viewer to breathe and soak in the world, and run away with their creativity. It's one of the most unique and imaginative shows ever created, and I strongly recommend it to kids and families everywhere. Here's hoping the rest of his adventures are eventually released.",1477612800,,2856,4.581213307240705

Thankfully I have these episodes from the Australian box set, which was not viciously bowdlerized in this manner. Go check them out on YouTube, where you can be trusted to form your own opinions.
