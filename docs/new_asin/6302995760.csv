535562,5,6302995760,"A very nice Jimmy Stewart performance from his pre-WW II period. There is a marked difference in his character and performances in his before and after the war movies. Margaret Sullavan, as always, was lovely. She and Walter Pidgeon do a first class job of acting.",1387756800,3,264,4.760869565217392
535563,5,6302995760,"Jimmy Stewart is at his charming best in this film.  If you thrive on the action films of today you may not like this one, but if you love old movies that tug at your heart, you can't beat this gem!",1378166400,2,198,3.8292682926829267
535564,5,6302995760,"This lovely little film is a superb example of Golden Age Hollywood at its best and in particular of MGM.

I did not know of this picture when many years ago I saw it as the second half of a double bill at a repertory theater. Its charm and understated treatment of what reads as a melodramatic romance have remained with me ever since.

The film is not dated in the least. Perhaps most noteworthy is the mature handling of the lovers' relationship between Margaret Sullavan and her agent, Walter Pidgeon. The raw intensity of their relationship is made tangible by the script and H.C. Potter's subtle direction -- with the actors' clothes on, of course, and indeed with little physical contact. (Here is one of thousands of examples how the self-censorship Production Code which ruled Hollywood till 1966 helped make movies better.) The impact on them of rube James Stewart's sweet, nave crush on Miss Sullavan's glamorous Daisy Heath is the clincher of the plot, not, as one would expect, the relationship between the two principals.

The final scene is a masterly illustration of the far superior direction of the era compared with today's. With no dialogue, Potter dramatizes perfectly the bittersweet d&eacute;nouement. His final shot of the tearful Miss Sullavan, struggling to finish her song after learning the dread news, is unforgettable. In those days filmmakers understood the poetry lies in what you see, not in talk. They also understood the dramatic value of distance, as against the crude tight shots so common today.

When we hear it said, They don't make 'em like that any more, Shopworn Angel is the kind of movie being discussed.",1360454400,13,1649,4.920863309352518
535565,4,6302995760,"""The Shopworn Angel"" is the second onscreen pairing of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. They are a delight to see and certainly their offscreen chmsitry is evident onscreen as well. In this film, Margaret's role as a jaded actress and James's as a naive, starry eyed soldier perfectly complement each other. Though opposites, their relationship is believable. James's innocent charm would be imposible to resist, even for such a wary woman as Margaret in the film. Especially effective in this movie are the small details such as James's boyish posting of Margaret's photograph in his army locker, the ice cream they share at a drugstore, and the figurine of the Staute of Liberty they win together at a carnival. Each detail is handled with such care in the film that when the staute of liberty figurine is later broken at one point in the movie, the vieiwer feels as if James and Margaret's relationship has been broken. Though the film may seem overly sentimental and predictable (Margaret and James get married, James dies a hero in the war, Marget's cold heart turns warm and she's from then on friendly to all her fans--especially the soldiers), it's the sincerity and strong performances from the lead actors that make it overcome its weaknesses. Rather than fall into trite melodrama, it is a touching, quiet film that is one of the best exampes of James Stewart's early career and leaves no question as to why he's considered the classic All-American actor.",1295308800,5,1470,4.931451612903226
535566,4,6302995760,"SHOPWORN ANGEL is a movie about a worldly Broadway actress (Margaret Sullivan) who meets a doughboy (Jimmy Stewart) just before he leaves for France. Stewart is a naive cowboy from Texas who brags to his army buddies that he knows Sullivan. When they actually do meet Stewart immediately falls in love with her. The only complication is that Sullivan really loves her business manager Walter Pigeon. This awkward situation forces both Sullivan and Pigeon to look deeper and learn new truths about life and love.
Margaret Sullivan is superb as her character changes visibly from a spoiled and egotistical mess into a warm and giving adult. Stewart, Pigeon and Hattie McDaniel give their usual strong performances mostly playing themselves. Sullivan's singing is dubbed by Mary Martin.
H.C. Potter also directed MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE, HELLZAPOPPIN and THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.",1059782400,16,887,5.20979020979021
535567,3,6302995760,"In THE SHOPWORN ANGEL, the image of folksy Jimmy Stewart was solidified.  His Bill Pettigrew is the all-American innocent, slightly fumbling of manner and drawling of speech; in fact the most effective moments of the movie centers around apple pie!  There was a certain chemistry between Sullavan and Stewart that's rather elusive; perhaps it was the result of their own friendship and understanding of each other.  Sullavan had a wistful and appealing aura and the ability to show the feminine side of a woman; vulnerability was Maggie's forte.  The setting is New York in 1917 just after America's entry into the World War, when a rather glib actress - Daisy Heath - (Sullavan), almost knocks over a young soldier, Bill Pettigrew (Stewart).  Daisy finds this young farmer from Texas refreshingly different from any man she's ever known...............The sentiment nature of Dana Burnett's novel, PRIVATE PETTIGREW'S GIRL needed a lot of shoring up for 1938 audiences (it was filmed priorly in 1928 with Gary Cooper and Nancy Carroll).  It's the authority of the two lead performances which make this film bearable; Sullavan invested her scenes with an eloquence of expression and Stewart made his characterization solid, even though the script gave him little to work with.",1006041600,15,1275,5.195121951219512
535568,4,6302995760,"Interesting variation on the small-town-boy-comes-to-the-city theme, with Jimmy Stewert as the noble-hearted hick falling in love with a girl from  New York who's been round the block a few times, but to whose dalliances he  remains impervious. My favourite scene is where Jimmy is told how the  cattle are rounded up in Times Square. Let down only by a slightly  sentimental ending.",967161600,10,383,5.129032258064516
