8448714,5,B004YQ334Q,"An outstanding moderated discussion of the intellectual integrity of Christian theism by three eminent Oxford professors, representing academic fields as diverse as mathematics, philosophy of science, theology, biology, and philosophy. Two of the three participants used to be atheists, so they bring insight about that worldview to the discussion. This is not a fitting DVD for ideological atheists (see some of the negative reviewers for examples) or uneducated theists (or atheists). Ideological atheists will not be able to acknowledge the significance of the dialogue without feeling threatened. Uneducated theists will struggle to understand many of the lines of thinking and conceptual references. I have read more than one hundred books related to science, philosophy of science, theology, philosophy, psychology, and theory construction. I found that I could easily follow their discussion. However, that would not have been the case ninety books ago. For example, an important concept in the philosophy of science is abduction, also known as inference to the best explanation. When Ward, McGrath, or Lennox alluded to this idea, I understood the significance of their reference. If I did not know about abduction, I would not have appreciated its importance to the matters under discussion. If there were a single DVD on the topic of science, philosophy, and God (hot topics today), that I would recommend to sufficiently open-minded and educated persons, atheist or theist, it would be this one.",1459728000,2,1506,5.495689655172414

8448716,3,B004YQ334Q,Very little new analysis coupled with marginal audio earned this DVD three stars.  If a viewer had limited prior exposure to the material a better star rating might be appropriate.,1406851200,,180,5.0
8448717,5,B004YQ334Q,"This two DVD set is an excellent exploration of more subtle minds who happen to believe in God and are Christians. It is not apologetics and not a debate. It is a philosophical and theological exploration of ideas. All of the scholars have a distinguished body of work to pull on and the conversations are very constructive. Anyone looking to understand the relation between scientific and theological concepts in an open minded and deeper way, this is a great video set. It will send you looking for the books that these men have written.
  It should be noted that I have actually purchased and closely watched these recordings. The content of the other review here on Amazon comes from someone who almost certainly has never seen these videos at all. The remarks are tangential at best and non-sequiturs in the main. It is obvious that this is someone who hates Christian theology and will put out random one star ratings wherever they can. These kind of reviews should really be screened out.",1352592000,11,995,4.77906976744186
8448718,1,B004YQ334Q,"There is NO 'debate' on this dvd. Just another example of true believing Christians pretending to be ""scientific"" and ""logical"", and pretending that the ""evidence"" is, of course, on their side. It's sad that contemporary Christians are so desperate to prop up their faith with so much pseudo-science and other irrational arguments, and even some twisting of facts. I don't know if the makers of this dvd are true believers or not, but there is a great deal of charlatanism going on in the US regarding Christianity. Telling Christians exactly what they want to hear is a multi-billion dollar business in the US. $$$$. For just a few dollars here and there, you can be told that your faith is true and correct, and supported by ""history"" and ""evidence"". Those charlatans should be put in jail for fraud.

ps: Anytime someone goes out of their way to ""sell"" you on how real and important their credentials are, that in itself should be a red flag. Think -- then think again.",1333497600,2,972,4.7176470588235295
