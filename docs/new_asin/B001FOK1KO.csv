I fell asleep watching this. If you don't already own ""That's it, that's all,"" buy it instead of this!",1262563200,,263,4.931818181818182
8458920,5,B001FOK1KO,"With the winter tradition of Absinthe Films releasing their latest installation, Ready does not disappoint.  If you love big mountain and free riding, this as with every other Absinthe film, is your DVD.

If you're a park rat who has never ventured to the backcountry and encountered 40 degree slopes, waist deep pow, and narrow chutes, this is NOT your DVD.",1226275200,,358,4.852459016393443
