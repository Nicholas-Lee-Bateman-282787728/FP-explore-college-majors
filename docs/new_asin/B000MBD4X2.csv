2727912,5,B000MBD4X2,Got it for my husband for Christmas.  He loved it.  Watches it over and over and thinks it's still funny every time.,1374192000,,116,4.2272727272727275
2727913,4,B000MBD4X2,Was very funny.  It had so many comedians and we really enjoyed watching it.  The sound was low at times but still worth seeing.,1372896000,,128,4.291666666666667
2727914,5,B000MBD4X2,"With Don Rickles being the Roastmaster and the usual guests on the roster, I fell out laughing with Foster Brooks and Gladys Ormphby turn at the podium. This brings back memories of good clean comedy from the '70s.",1368144000,2,214,4.657894736842105
2727915,3,B000MBD4X2,"I own both the DVD and VHS, the quality of course for the VHS is not the best.  Check to make sure which you have when you buy.",1355356800,2,127,3.5357142857142856
2727916,1,B000MBD4X2,"First let me say I love Dean Martin.  I have DVDs of his weekly shows.  I looked forward to watching Dean get roasted.

First - the sound is so poor I had my Sony flat screen at max of 95 and it was barely audible.

Second - there is no captioning which is necessary for this DVD with just terrible audio.

Third - there is no ""pause"" available soooo once you start the DVD you must sit there until the very end.

Would I buy this again?  Yeah - I'm a Dean Martin fan and although this DVD really stinks I had to have it.  Soooo - if you gotta have it, you gotta buy it.",1353715200,3,570,3.853448275862069
2727917,3,B000MBD4X2,"I love Dean Martin but I detest Greg Garrison who narrates ""and ruins"" anything having to do with Dean Martin.  I have a complete set of Martin's TV shows and Greg Garrison ruins every disc - you have to jump over his nonsensical narrations - who wants to hear Greg Garrison blab?  Anyhow, got this DVD 'cause I had to have it.  So, buy it if you love Dean but you will suffer with the narrations if there are any on this DVD.",1350604800,3,426,4.108433734939759

2727925,5,B000MBD4X2,"This is a great episode of the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. We laughed through the whole thing. It was nice to see all the greats again, and ""Columbo's"" tribute to Frank Sinatra was priceless.
