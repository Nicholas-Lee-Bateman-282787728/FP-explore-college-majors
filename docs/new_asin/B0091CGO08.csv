8534021,3,B0091CGO08,"For fans of the Manga thinking about plunking down the $74 or so that some are asking for the imported DVD pack, it's really not worth it.

The movie follows the story of Kirin, a corporate grunt by day and on the off-hours, a veteran motorcycle street racer.  It takes place during the later part of his life (I don't know the manga that covers this part of the story so I can't compare), where he's haunted by three things: the loss of his wife and daughter, a crash that happened while racing a white Porsche 911, and his Katana liter bike (the one developed by BMW for Suzuki) that he thought he totalled.  THe movie is predictable: he finds a new love, finds his old bike has been rebuilt by a friend of his, and races the Porsche again...

There aren't any good fiction movies in the motorcycle genre (although a few good documentaries), mostly the motorcycle stuff is stupid and unrealistic - Kirin is only a tiny bit better.  The motorcycle stuff is conceptually realistic - so no sportbikes jumping over speeding trains without a ramp - but nevertheless all the riding is faked.  So if you're looking for a movie with some cool motorcycle scenes - you'll have to stick to documentaries like Faster, and On Any Sunday.

What this movie does have for motorcycle fans is some nice motorcycle props.  Some nice ""vintage"" Japanese sportbikes: something we don't see a lot of in the movies.  SO for motorcycle movie fans and fans of the Kirin Manga, this is (probably) a must-see.  Just don't pay more than the regular DVD price to see it.",1368057600,2,1542,4.534296028880866
