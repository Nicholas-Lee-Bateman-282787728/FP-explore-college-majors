8723713,5,B0117KSHM4,Woody has been my favorite teacher for years. This DVD is great. Challanging on some but not too difficult on others. Most importantly his compositions are cool.,1488153600,,161,5.0
8723714,5,B0117KSHM4,"Woody Mann is a great guitar player and a fantastic teacher. This DVD set truly kicked my understanding of the guitar into a different gear. I'm an experienced guitar player who have been playing for years but, like many others, had gotten stuck in the blues scale and some more or less basic chords. Woody elegantly breaks the guitar apart into essentially the left and right hand of the piano and leads you on a journey across the fretboard. I was surprised how quickly I began to visualize the different shapes up and down the neck and how that advanced my understanding and fluency of across the fretboard. Plus, the songs Woody teach on this DVD are just great and now the favourites of my repertoire. This is not a DVD for beginners however as some of the songs are fairly complicated. I practiced fingerstyle blues guitar for about a year before getting this and I'm guessing you'll be frustrated if you don't have a solid foundation with this. But if you're looking to take your guitar playing to the next level in the company of terrific teacher, this is a perfect resource.",1466380800,,1083,4.616580310880829
