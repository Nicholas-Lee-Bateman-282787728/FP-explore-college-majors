Personally, I would live at the beach if I could so this is the next best thing.  And after all, Im under doctors orders... so yes, five stars here!",1438992000,,402,4.333333333333333
8646608,3,B00IYTDHQ8,"Have bought Bike-O-Vision DVDs in the past and was curious as to the Hike version of these DVDs.  Unfortunately, all seem to be DVD-R now instead of actual DVDs (like in the past).  With the Hike version, there is a noticeable up-and-down camera motion from the walking action, which is distracting and makes me slightly dizzy.  Compared to the Bike-O-Vision DVDs, in this one there is no music and only sounds from the surrounding area/ocean.  In my view, the walking pace is too slow, so it will not suit someone jogging or running on a treadmill.  The 'Virtual Active Hike' DVDs are superior in quality, suit treadmill jogging/running better and cost about the same.",1408320000,,669,4.833333333333333
