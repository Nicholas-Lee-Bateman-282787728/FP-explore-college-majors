2860074,1,B000R7FM3Q,"Wow. I heard some positvie things about this collection of short films, but was shocked to find it to be scattered and poorly made. Sparing the first and last films, the collection was actually hard to watch. I have no idea how it won any awards.

""Open"" is actually possibly the worst short film I have ever witnessed. And I have seen short films made on a zero budget by friends. The dialogue was trite and the acting horrible. There was a lot of ""humorous"" moments the fell short of even being tolerable. Like a lesbian pretending to hit on a chair? That is...what? funny? Or two girls doing exaggerated impressions of female porn stars that just go on and on. Is that supposed to be racy? Just the worst piece of film I have ever sat through. If only it had been longer than ten minutes I would have turned it off.
""Sugared Peas"" makes me shudder to even think about. So obvious and contrived, it makes me wonder how anybody ever considered actually putting it out for release on this collection.
""Open Studio"" is about a lady trying to reclaim her long lost artistic ability. It has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with lesbians. (I think her daughter might be a lesbian.) Also, the film is very poorly written and the overly dramatic acting just made it obvious that this was an amatuer work.
The first film, ""Unspoken"", is actually really well shot and professional. Decent acting and dialogue also contributes to it being a well made film. Only problem is that it has a beginning and a middle but no ending. It was like watching a part of a movie and then having someone turn the tv off. I know it's a short, but short films are still supposed to tell a story (last time I checked) and not just give you a snippet of someone's life.
The last film, ""Different"" was the only one I actually enjoyed. Seemed like a film school project, but one that was somewhat original.

Another odd thing about this collection is that it obviously collected films made over at least a decade. The films were only loosely bound by the lesbian theme. Other than that they had no relation to one another.
All in all this was not worth any money. It was a huge waste of my time.
I've seen enough poorly made short films to last me a lifetime and I didn't need to buy a new collection of them.
There are other collections of short films that are far better than this.",1205625600,10,2345,4.413394919168591

2860161,5,B000R7FM3Q,"Yeah--the last film ""OPEN"" was the best short film on here!  Clever, engaging, authentic, and hilarious!!!  Cool how they shot it backwards in time for the ""reveal.""  Definitely a comedy when three lesbians are experimenting with an open relationship.  Loved when they poked fun at ridiculous male-directed porn.  Funny and real!",1402876800,,329,5.372549019607843
2860162,5,B000R7FM3Q,why? because it is not what you think. it is lesbian relationships. bit it really is not sexual. it is about relationships. it is well done and viewers will come away feeling counseled on their relationship whether hetero or gay.  i will watch it again.,1402876800,3,253,4.622222222222222
2860163,2,B000R7FM3Q,I can't really comment on it because I watched it once...that's all I could take.  I'm not sure if I just didn't like because the short stories left me hanging or what.,1392681600,,168,4.25
2860164,1,B000R7FM3Q,Not good and I did not even watch more then a few minutes so I wouldn't waste my time watching,1391904000,,94,3.75

2860166,1,B000R7FM3Q,These stories were very weak at best. I did however like the last one which was a way to deal with homosexuality on a reverse angle. Very clever idea.,1368489600,,150,4.206896551724138

2860178,2,B000R7FM3Q,"it's okay. i got the first story, but after that it pretty went down hill from there. i like that the girl from PLL is in this movie! she is super purrty. othere than that pretty low quailty and kinda all over the place.",1354924800,,220,4.0227272727272725

2860180,1,B000R7FM3Q,"1. super 90's self loathing.
2. no clear plot lines.
3.not one good film... not even close.
if you want to enjoy a series of short lesbian films you won't find it here. if you on the other hand want to remember how hard being in the closet was during high school, this is your film!",1336780800,2,282,4.053571428571429
2860181,1,B000R7FM3Q,This is one of the worst things I've ever wasted my time and money on. I'm sorry I sacrificed an hour of my life on this rubbish. Someone needs to make a lesbian movie that actually does us some justice.,1332460800,3,203,4.1
2860182,5,B000R7FM3Q,"This collection deserves all the praise and awards it has received. Really,no faves here,all the films are winners! Truly unforgettable experience.",1326153600,,147,6.0476190476190474
2860183,5,B000R7FM3Q,"The characters in this ""film"" are pretty depressing to watch, but it does have a point about lesbianism and bullying.",1316044800,2,117,4.9
2860184,5,B000R7FM3Q,"Five shorts; all with their own surprises.  Not always 'happy ending's, not always the greatest acting, yet they all held their own. And all for different reasons. Gay/lesbian films are always a toss up; you never know if you'll feel good for watching it. This was a smart, sexy, sometimes sad, selection. I don't regret watching it!",1310342400,13,333,4.842105263157895
2860185,2,B000R7FM3Q,Most of the short films had no clear begining middle or end. The stories were okay but it was hard to form an opinion on something so short. I really thought since I was paying for this that it would be of a higher quality than the webseries girl/girl scene which is free. Although I do like the last short film in this movie.,1305504000,3,326,4.109375
2860186,4,B000R7FM3Q,"I wasn't really expecting much because so many LGBT films are so low budget and usually not that good. But my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised. It's several short films. The first was the best, about a high school experience I think almost every gay girl goes through. The second was my least favorite. But the rest were all pretty good. Decent quality. Good story lines and over-all enjoyable. A lot of lesbians will be able to relate to some of these stories.",1277337600,37,471,4.619047619047619

8199201,1,B000R7FM3Q,"I could not figure out how to give zero stars, otherwise I would have. This is without a doubt the worst thing that I have ever seen. I have seen toilet flushing that was more entertaining and better scripted than these ""films"". I thought that people were being harsh in their reviews, but if they had not been so undeservedly kind I would not have wasted my two dollars.",1432252800,,371,4.391304347826087

8199203,5,B000R7FM3Q,This movie certainly expresses many views that will interest anyone. It shows true emotions that many girls battle with. It is a sweet story that is complex as well as well as simple if you only understand the innocent confusion of a girls view.,1424044800,,245,4.590909090909091
