8446681,4,B004XC5LKU,"Once upon a time, CBS offered something other than football on Sunday afternoons: an invitation to meet and converse with a variety of significant, twentieth-century figures. All had accomplished much and had achieved a level of fame attending their achievements; few were ""celebrities"" in today's glitzy sense. They included Leonard Bernstein, Pearl S. Buck, E. B, White, William Faulkner, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Sugar Ray Robinson. Their stories were introduced by Alistair Cooke, who himself went on to achieve a level of fame for his articulate journalism and reporting. We are fortunate that this compilation has survived. I docked one star for three reasons. First, I wished for more in the collection. Second, among those included, I wished for more from each subject. Third, the audio and video are indeed subpar, though the elements with which the DVDs' producers had to work were doubtless in very bad shape. Nevertheless, for those interested in some of the best of American culture in the mid-twentieth century, this video volume deserves a place on your shelf. These men and women left upon us indelible marks for good; ""Omnibus: American Profiles"" allows us to meet them simply, without pretense or razzle-dazzle.",1511395200,,1228,5.238578680203045

8446686,5,B004XC5LKU,"The EB White segment about lobstering in Maine is worth the purchase price alone; the bonus was everything else.  A great interview with James Thurber and a fascinating one with Frank Lloyd Wright.  Alistair Cooke, cigarette in hand, was a talented interlocutor.  The video quality isn't great but will be familiar for those of us who grew up with a TV antenna and all of three channels from which to choose.",1350345600,6,408,4.71830985915493
8446687,5,B004XC5LKU,"I recently got into a discussion of music in general which triggered a memory of this long-ago TV Series.

I remember many of these shows vividly, but not all of them.  Mostly I remember the feeling of anticipation, the reveling in the sheer joy of discovery, and most of all the introductory music and image collage.

Remembering the music, I rummaged in my mind for the title of ""that old TV Series"" -- and after a few days what surfaced was the word OMNIBUS.

But I couldn't remember the moderator, though I do remember how incredibly impressive he was.

So I googled Omnibus TV Series and came to the wikipedia page that said Alistair Cooke.  It's a very short entry but reminded me why the series was so impressive.  It won a lot of really hard-to-win awards.

If you are looking for a TV Series on DVD to share with your kids over dinner on Sunday night, try this series.

If you want to study exactly how to put together a non-fiction TV Series that will be remembered for decades, get this DVD.

Now don't forget this is very primitive video because they didn't have much back then, and it's amazing it still exists.  It's the material and presentation -- the title, the music, the manner of the moderator, but most of all the ""make-the-most-of-limited-means"" production.

The production values may look laughable now, but look at how this was funded by grant money -- it was an exceptionally low budget creation that relied wholly on content and elegance of technical execution.

If you are aiming to produce something for YouTube or to write a low-budget movie script, this TV Series is where to start studying how it's done.  Penetrating and Memorable.",1350172800,10,1663,4.670103092783505
