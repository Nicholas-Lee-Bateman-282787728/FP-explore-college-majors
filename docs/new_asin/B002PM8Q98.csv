8377094,1,B002PM8Q98,"This movie was horrible.  Made in German and done over with English.  Sound was horrible.  Sounded like you were in a room without furniture - lots of echoing.  During the video, there was a ton of crackling in the sound which made it impossible to listen to.  Take my advice, do not waste your time or money with this.",1448150400,2,319,4.338983050847458

8377096,2,B002PM8Q98,The acting and the story plot looks like this could have been a good movie.  But this was a German movie dubbed in English-the lip sinc was way off and I just couldn't get past that.  I thought that much of the English voice was without emotion and it was painfully obvious the characters weren't really saying what was on the screen.  What was even more painful was that I payed much more for this movie than I payed for many other disaster movies which I felt were alot better.  Save your money and don't buy this movie!,1268352000,4,522,4.295918367346939
