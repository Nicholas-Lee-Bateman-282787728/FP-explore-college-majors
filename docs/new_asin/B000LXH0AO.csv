2717410,2,B000LXH0AO,"Ignore the first movie, they've changed the rules and brought the dead to life to compete in another installment.  This one owes even more to Porky's than the last one did.  People go missing, few care, the witnesses from the last movie are conveniently forgotten, just the lone crackpot (miraculously alive) remains to tie them together (plus a clone, a last minute explanation to explain another holdover from the first movie).  Ridiculous.  It also ends with a threat...""THE END, maybe.""

2717412,3,B000LXH0AO,"DECOYS
THE SECOND SEDUCTION

Well Luke is back and he is trying to get over what happened in the first film which was one of the better parts of the first one. This time around it is basically the same exact film but with a different cast and well that is it. The ladies are back and they are needing some sex once more and of course the fellas are down to get down, we guys are so easy. But thanks to Luke and another kid that happens to see them much like Luke did in the first film they may not succeed.

The first film was kinda funny and had some enjoyable moments in it and this one follows that same formula, this time though there is some good T & A. That is basically the biggest difference this time around as some of the ladies bare it for the cameras so this must be the unrated edition on DVD. Writers Tom Berry and Miguel Tejada-Flores really didn't change things up much for this go round and director Jeffery Scott Lando keeps things about the same.

I am not really sure if I like this one better or which film I prefer but I guess they are about the same, did I already say that? Corey Sevier returns and is seeking some psychiatric help because he is not sure if the events were real. Oh and also the Lampoon style of the first is here in the form of a contest between the guys as they have to film their interactions with the opposite sex with their camera phones. Tyler Johnston plays Sam and is the lead this time around that learns of these creatures first, much like Luke in the first.

Dina Meyer is good in this one as one would expect, you may know her from SAW 2, 3, and 4 and appearances on shows like BURN NOTICE and MONK. Also of SAW fame we have the great Tobin Bell in this flick and he is actually in a bit more then one would think. The ladies look good in this film and in fact I prefer the ones in this one, that may be because the strip in this one. The acting is fine and at times over the top much like the first, but it is this kinda flick.

This is a decent flick and worth a rental or catching on TV or something I guess if you liked the first I think you will like this one. I was lucky enough to buy both for the price of one in a two pack so I guess it was worth it.",1244073600,,2212,3.9506726457399104
2717413,5,B000LXH0AO,a very good sequel to Decoys and I usually do not like sequels at all!!,1178409600,,71,3.8
2717414,2,B000LXH0AO,"Did we really need a second DECOYS?  No.

Is this one any better than the first?  It's really the same movie.

Is it any good?  Barely.  It's more of a comic horror film than straight.

Is there lots of t&a?  Yes, but isn't that what this is all about?

Will there be a third?  What do you think?",1176249600,,296,3.9482758620689653
2717415,4,B000LXH0AO,"The alien seducers from the original movie are back and they are trying to be more careful.  Our hero from the first movie is also back and in therapy.  He is also devouring evolutionary biology in some hopes of understanding what he went through.  But the main characters are a group of horny college students how have put together a contest to see who can sleep with the most women.  One of the roommates is a little reluctant 9he's holding out of someone else), and another is a virgin who would do it with anyone (except a gorgeous babe who is interested in him).  But the other two are fully into the idea.  Their attempts to pick up girls overlap the alien girls' attempts to mate with human males.  Unfortunately the babes still have the usual problem of freezing their mates.

The alien babes are not as careful as they should be so some students other than our hero begin to suspect that something is going on.  As the evidence piles up the students know that the authorities would never believe them so they set out to locate and stop the aliens before they either kill more or succeed in their plans.  Eventually all of the characters are working together and put together a plan of action.  Will they succeed?  Will they be forced to have sex with beautiful aliens?  Will there be another sequel?  You will have to watch in order to find out.

The original movie had the tag line, ""They can seduce anyone.""  But in the first they had trouble with this.  In the second movie they still do.  The characters you would think are the most eager are actually the most reluctant.  But other than that, this actually follows the first movie better than most sequels do.  Monsters, beautiful women, nudity, camp, and a reasonable plot actually make this better than a lot of the horror coming out these days.  I was somewhat surprised when the alien leader told the others that they had to take move more slowly in their seductions (more foreplay) so they don't freeze their mates and then they seem to move even faster.  Oh, well.  This movie does not try to be what it is not so it succeeds at trying to be what it is, a silly sex comedy/sci-fi horror film.  Watch out for the flying ice cubes!",1176163200,3,2199,4.467336683417085

there's always some males around.  3 stars is the maximum this movie should get.  The filmmakers could have extended the movie by 1/2 hour by

continuing the movie at the end because it was getting good but noooo... might as well spit at the fans and end the movie and keep the rest for a possible decoy 3.",1174348800,4,450,4.174418604651163
2717417,5,B000LXH0AO,"""Decoys 2: Alien Seduction"" is a fun sci-fi romp through the world of joking, jocking college kids that delivers on every level advertised.

The babes are hot (for blondes), Tobin Bell and Dina Meyer are good, Corey Sevier great and the alien-sex-tenticle-deaths are hilarious and well done.

This is fun movie--not the scariest movie in the world, but a great looking, well produced cross between ""Porkys"" and ""Species"".

Who cares about the overused plot about college males who make a bet and nasty aliens in disguised which want to conquer the planet yet again? Watch it at the first degree: bimbos, hunks lusting after everything in a skirt, heavy jokes, happy ending.

8165149,4,B000LXH0AO,"Released in 2007, Decoys 2: Alien Seduction chronicles events at a Canadian campus where female aliens masquerade as hot blondes and seduce male students in order to perpetuate their dying species. Corey Sevier and Kim Poirier return from the first film, the former as a secondary protagonist and the latter is one of the key aliens. Michelle Molineux plays another notable alien, amongst others, all gorgeous. This time Tyler Johnston and Kailin See star as the student heroes assisted by a few others. Dina Meyer and Tobin Bell are on hand as a psychiatrist and professor respectively.

Like the first movie, Decoys 2 mixes elements of 1995s Species with the campus environment of 1998s Urban Legend, but also adds a subplot from 1999s The Rage: Carrie 2 in that the male students compete in a game to see who can bed more hotties. If you like any of those films then youll probably like this one, which is on par or better (except I prefer The Rage for reasons cited in my review). In any case, Decoys 2 is cut from the same cloth as its predecessor and might even be a little better. It offers possibly even better women (e.g. Kailin See, Meyer and Molineux) and definitely has better F/X as the appearance of the creatures has noticeably improved. The cast is even better in that a group of students and someone else team-up against the aliens and their camaraderie is a pleasure.

While many people hate the Decoys movies I give them a relatively high rating simply because they're entertaining, which is my main criteria for the worthiness of any movie. Both Decoys and Decoys 2 hit most of the mandatory checkboxes for an effective horror flick. I particularly like the campus-in-the-dead-of-winter locations, which no other slasher/monster flick has done to my knowledge. Speaking of the locations, Decoys 2 was shot on an Edmonton campus, roughly 2000 miles west of the Ottawa locations of the first film.

Maybe the reason horror aficionados dislike the Decoys films is because they add humor and camp. I usually don't like horror films that mix-in comedy, like 2002s crappy Cabin Fever, but the Decoys films mix them in a palatable way. Neither of these movies is scary, although there are a couple of got ya scenes and the aliens are hideous, but they're satisfyingly amusing with good casts and superb women.

The film runs 94 minutes.
