1845751,4,B00008G6JS,Found this tape very useful for the intermediate player.  Has some intermediate to advanced chops on finger style flat top that are the roots of a lot of electric blues.  I've been picking songs off by ear for years but Keb Mo has some exotic sounding but simple chords- if you see where they are played.  Beats the hell out of $30.00 worth of private lessons!,979689600,7,360,4.424242424242424
7983558,5,B00008G6JS,I really enjoy Keb's teaching style. I am an intermediate level guitarist and this DVD is a good fit for me.,1437868800,,108,4.190476190476191
7983559,5,B00008G6JS,"I favor electric blues to acoustic but I would buy this DVD and watch it for the sheer joy of watching Keb Mo (one of the best acoustic blues men of our time in my opinion) work. if you want to play acoustic blues please do not pass this up. if you are a fan of great guitar playing don't pass this up. it is awesome. by the way, the tabs are on the DVD. You just need to locate and print them",1419379200,2,393,3.746987951807229

7983561,5,B00008G6JS,"Keb Mo has a strong command of the blues tradition, and does an excellent job of conveying what he knows in this DVD. He is very good at breaking down various aspects of blues guitar playing into manageable chunks, and then demonstrating how to put them back together again. If you already play guitar, and now want to learn to play finger-style blues, perhaps inspired by players like Robert Johnson, this is a very good starting place.",1361750400,,437,4.688311688311688
7983562,5,B00008G6JS,"I truly am impressed by Keb Mo and his talent. I've not even put a dent in this product and I'm already feeling more confident in my skills. Keb Mo is one of those artist I heard of years ago and I never gave him much thought, perhaps because I was so busy trying to emulate people that were truly talented as musicians but had no staying power, and ultimately no soul. Keb Mo has soul, and with this product he demonstrates that and conveys it in such a way that you totally understand it. Thanks for a great product, and thank you Keb Mo for all you do. I only wish you still lived in Compton so I could perhaps check you out for some private lessons.",1349913600,4,653,4.109375
7983563,3,B00008G6JS,"Masterful player, however sometimes hard to follow.  Some basic explanation of chords and strings noted would have made it much better.",1346025600,,135,5.428571428571429
7983564,5,B00008G6JS,This is your guide to improvising acoustic fingerstyle blues. I have yet to watch a video with so much packed into it. Keb is a patient teacher and full of gems that drop every second of the video. You could watch this tape 100 times and get something different out of it every time.,1281571200,,283,4.2592592592592595
7983565,3,B00008G6JS,"Watching this is like sitting down with a friend who plays well and occasionally slows down to let you try and see or sound out what he's doing.  Mo's hands are not particularly easy to read, neither he nor his assistant stop to mention which strings he's playing on, it's impossible to see, and the company that makes the DVD doesn't bother to superimpose any fret diagrams--even amateurs teaching on youtube will often do that.  I love Mo's music, and I am learning from this, but without the booklet that comes with it, the DVD would be not much help, so don't buy a version without that.  In fact, the booklet by itself would be nearly as useful as the whole DVD.  Not the best value.  I'm charmed to learn Perpetual Blues Machine and to jam along with Mo, but not so charmed I'd recommend purchasing this DVD to anyone.",1281312000,13,824,4.466666666666667
7983566,5,B00008G6JS,"If you want to learn the blues.....there is no better teacher.....and there is a version of the song ""Henry"" on here that will knock your socks off. Keb's guitar teacher assists him on this video and he is great too.",1244764800,2,216,4.425
7983567,5,B00008G6JS,"Keb'Mo' and his guitar teacher show you how it's done.  NOT for beginners, but very informative to learn new techniques in blues guitar.

It's even entertaining for those of us (like me) with no musical talent.  I bought it for my husband.",1168300800,4,239,4.642857142857143
