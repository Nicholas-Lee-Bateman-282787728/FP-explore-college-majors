7669123,4,B01BTDOSVS,"Actually quite good. I really liked it! But then again I have always liked movies where the characters are trapped in a house/building/etc without a way out.

Most of all, I enjoyed not knowing who would survive and who would make it. This is why I prefer watching low budget horrors: You never know which direction a movie will go.

The acting was alright, the cast was likable, the FX were great (only bad FX I thought were the CGI dogs of hell), the sets/locations were great.

Definitely much better than your average SYFY movie.",1461628800,,533,4.589473684210526
7669124,1,B01BTDOSVS,"So I have to input the minimum text necessary to say...yeah, it really was that bad",1461369600,,83,4.25
7669125,1,B01BTDOSVS,"I was a fan of this cheesy movie when I saw it on SyFy, but I'm not a fan of paying 20 dollars for DVD-R. I could make that myself by finding the movie for free online and burning it onto a 25 cent blank DVD. And the movie and music industries wonder why their sales are tanking and projects can't get funded.",1458518400,7,309,3.9206349206349205
7669126,5,B01BTDOSVS,"I have to say, that if you don't take this movie too seriously, and are looking for pure entertainment, They found Hell is
great for what it is. Obviously, this movie is very tongue in cheek and the interpetation of Hell is not to be taken
in anyway as a Biblical truth. If you like the stupid black humor/gore of many 80's movies, They Found Hell works!",1458086400,5,354,4.298507462686567
7669127,2,B01BTDOSVS,So some whiz kid science kids open up a hole in Russia using some teleportation device. Then then end up sending themselves into Hell or into Dante's Inferno. Little to no background of the students or the school or the science program is given. It just happens. So the movie is kids being killed by monsters and so on. The movie is just mayhem for the fun of it I guess. I found the movie to be barely watchable. I was wanting this movie to be over some 13 or so minutes into it. It's not awful it's just a pretty pointless story. Why was I supposed to care about any of the characters? Watch it for the monsters I guess.,1458086400,,622,4.148760330578512
7669128,1,B01BTDOSVS,"Avoid at any and all costs. Was it more gory and risky than what SyFy normally pumps out? Yes. Funnily enough ripping the arm off a living screaming human, a pretty forward lesbian scene and some leathface inspired costume design A-ok! But showing a demon take a bite out of a severed limb is where they simply must draw the line.
So just go in and don't expect much of anything!",1458086400,2,379,4.352112676056338

8751414,5,B01BTDOSVS,They found hell is a  great moive but there. Is a lot of blood ln it still.a.good movie,1487635200,,87,3.8333333333333335
8751415,4,B01BTDOSVS,"When a group of gifted college students run a secret teleportation experiment, they accidentally open a portal to another dimension, trapping them in Hell. One by one they are hunted, tortured, and killed by the denizens of Hell who are bent on stealing their souls. Do not take this movie too seriously, this id one of those movies that were meant to be a bit of fun and rather gory. You have your usual cast of characters, nothing much different there. I really did like it a lot and I was not expecting too much....surprise! The ending left me a bit cold and the rest of the movie held my interest and the actors....pretty good for a bunch of names I never heard of. The concept was even different enough to really keep me engaged. Not for everyone because it is very bloody but still to me....worthwhile enough to watch.",1479340800,,824,4.5
8751416,1,B01BTDOSVS,"Like a Hi-8 a 14 year old made with his friends with ok CGI. Better than some, worse than most.",1477353600,,95,3.8

8751419,2,B01BTDOSVS,"A group of college kids who dropped out of drama class create a transporter and accidentally make a gateway to hell...and get sucked in. For most of the film we watch them battle various creatures which would normally make a great film, but since this was made for US TV it got watered down with boring dialogue, except for the guy who died first.

Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity",1468800000,,382,4.457142857142857
8751420,2,B01BTDOSVS,"Didn't realize this was a Syfy channel movie until the very obvious cuts for commercials started on the DVD. Decent practical effects, okay story, but first-time actors and incredibly poor CGI monsters ruin the movie.",1465084800,,217,5.228571428571429
