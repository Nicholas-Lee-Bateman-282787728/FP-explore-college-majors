2714881,5,B000LV6OJY,"I just love this show! I found it by accident when purchasing other British comedies on Amazon. It's a comedy along the lines of Fawlty Towers, The Thin Blue Line and Blackadder. Yet, One Foot in the Grave is distinctly unique. It covers an overlooked segment of the population (the recently retired & aging segment).

If you have never saw One Foot in the Grave, start at season 1 and work your way up through all the seasons. The show and characters are more enjoyable watched in order, as many times they will work off something that occured in a previous show. Season 1 & 3 are my favorites, but, Season 2 has its share of hilarious moments. My favorite episodes are ""We have put her Living into the Grave"" and ""Love and Death"".

An overview of the show, is about a 60 year old man (Mr. Victor Meldrew) whom is forced into retirement and has his whole life turned upside down. He feels he's just been forced to wait for death. As he battles against a world that now longer makes sense, trouble seems to find him at every corner. Richard Wilson plays Victor Meldrew and Annette Crosbie plays as his wife Margaret Meldrew. Both Crosbie and Wilson are hysterical & believable. Victor being on the brink of a breakdown all the time, and his wife the voice of sanity, that brings humor to every situation. Or is Victor the sanest of them all?

The older I get the more I identify with grumpy ole' Victor Meldrew.
Great show that gets funnier every season. If you are a fan of British comedy this is a must see!",1210464000,2,1509,4.420863309352518

2714883,5,B000LV6OJY,"If you loved Season 1, you'll love Season 2.  To me, this is one of the best BBC series I've seen, and I can watch it over and over again.",1202428800,,138,3.6
2714884,5,B000LV6OJY,"This series is hilarious. Our PBS station no longer shows it (sigh) but at least it is available for purchase on Amazon. If you want a good laugh, spend an hour or two with the long suffering Victor, and his wife.",1199664000,,213,4.219512195121951
2714885,5,B000LV6OJY,"This is a must-have for the Brit lovers who like their humor on the dark side.  The episodes beyond the first two seasons just get better and better.  Poor redundant Victor and his long-suffering wife get into so many tangles, and with such hilarity, that on more than one occasion my wife and I have had to wring the tears of laughter out of our socks.
By all means get seasons one and two and then join the queue demanding the release of further episodes.",1194220800,2,457,4.364705882352941

2714887,5,B000LV6OJY,The Muldrews are a couple who get along but are adjusting to retirement and what being around each other all the time entails. Mr Muldrew tends to be a very crabby old man and it's funny watching him trying to explain his crabbiness. The accent is not so thick that you need closed captiions which is a help to us in the Americas,1190678400,,329,4.238095238095238
2714888,5,B000LV6OJY,"This is one of the best British comedies. The Meldrews have more than there share of problems and Victor tells it like it is. When Margaret has had enough of the pissing and moaning she lets Victor know it!!!

I wish there was more of this series on DVD. I know there is more as I recall an episode where they all went on a trip to the continent and thought the were being detaned by the local authorities in a rundown hotel. Please do the whole series.",1178928000,3,453,4.1477272727272725

8164472,4,B000LV6OJY,"The BBC Worldwide video (Released March 27, 2007) consists of two discs. Disc 1 has the season two episodes and disc 2 had the Christmas special. Disc 2 uses the DVD-5 standard format and I have no trouble reading it. But disc 1 uses the DVD-9 format and neither of my players can read it. (See Wikipedia for a description of DVD-9. They are dual-sided, dual-layer discs with a capacity of 8.54 GB.)

My players are a 2010 Sony Blu-ray player (model BDP-D370) and an older Panasonic DVD player (model DVD-F87S.)

I can play disc 1 on my 3-month old PC which uses a Sony Optiarc model AD-7280S reader/writer.",1334448000,,607,4.559633027522936

8164474,5,B000LV6OJY,One of the best British sitcoms. Mr. Meldrew's crankiness reaches new heights (or lows?) in the second season. Also included is a very funny Xmas special. British sitcoms fans should love it.,1299628800,,191,5.0
8164475,4,B000LV6OJY,"Season 2 consists of two disks. The second contains only the 1990 Christmas special.
The Second season is better than the First. Most of the situations and jokes related to senior citizen life are comedy gold, they are funny and enjoyable, yet I think a better actor than Wilson (Victor) could make them much funnier.
A few situations do not work, or are just ridiculous. One example would be the turtle painted over with the street median paint line. A picture of a painted over (by a machine) road kill has been circulating the Internet for a long time. It is funny with a flattened road kill, but it is peculiar with a large, live, moving turtle.
Another such situation is the machine gun for Christmas in Disk 2. Machine guns, and for that matter all guns, even modestly powered air pellet guns are illegal in England. Even then I could overlook such weakness if the situations were funny, but they are not.
The performance of the supporting cast is excellent and funny.",1248220800,,974,4.635838150289017
8164476,5,B000LV6OJY,I have been looking for this series for quite some time. I am very pleased with my purchase and will contiue to purchase from Amazon!,1224806400,,133,4.36
8164477,5,B000LV6OJY,"Rating a comedy series is difficult because it really is a matter of personal taste.  Having said that, if you like good british comedy and possess a somewhat dark sense of humor, then I would highly recommend that you try this series.  I have all that are available.  Without trying to describe exactly what is going on in this comedy, suffice it to say that it is about a retired couple and all of the awful things that happen in the course of their lives.  Not awful, as in huge, but awful in the sense of the stupid stuff that happens that just makes life so darn difficult sometimes.  And it all happens to this poor put upon husband.  He is very cranky, but I would be too under the same circumstances.  His wife is patient and long suffering, but not really sympathetic to his ordeals.  Makes for many hilarious episodes. I watch this series over again every few months and I laugh just as hard each time.  But, as I said, this is not slapstick, falling down type of humor, of which I am not a great fan. If that is more your cup of tea, so to speak, this may not be the series for you.  No idiots here.  Not a lot of silliness either.  Just a man trying desperately to cope with the many speed bumps of life.",1215820800,,1216,4.216450216450217
