173583,1,0970742231,"I am not an atheist and actually am very interested in both sides, but this video has so many false segments and facts. He says that scientists haven't figured out how to create cold light like a firefly can. This statement is FALSE! I have actually created the exact same light a firefly uses in a lab and it is very easy. It's the same light a glow stick uses. So I still believe that evolution is the best know explanation we have for explaining the life we have today. I mean I'm not saying there are no flaws in evolution, but it is definitely the best way to explain the world around us.",1295740800,28,593,4.2105263157894735
173584,5,0970742231,"I purchased vol. 1 and then decided to also purchase volumes 2 and 3 as well.  We are thoroughly enjoying these videos.  I am using them as part of my homeschool science curriculum.  My kids beg to watch more than we have scheduled for the day.  For all of us, it's amazing to see how God created these animals just the way they needed to be to survive!",1253664000,6,353,4.147058823529412
173585,5,0970742231,"A reviewer below complained that this DVD is saying in effect, ""Life is complex

and so evolution could not have happened.""  That is not correct.  The DVD -

and so much more in nature than it has time to show - is showing the

IRREDUCIBLE complexity inherent in life forms on earth.  This starts at the

cellular level as microbiologist Michael Behe details in ""Darwin's Black Box.""

But this DVD is more fun than Behe's book, because it is so beautifully visual.

If you want to know more about the irreducible complexity of life, and lots

of other scientific facts that defy evolution (hey, Darwin was a 19th century

naturalist, not even a scientist and we have learned soooo much since then)

the DVD The Case for the Creator is also great to watch.",1169942400,2,755,4.552238805970149
173586,1,0970742231,"This video is complete nonsense. The thesis of the whole presentation can be summed up like this: ""Nature is extremely complex, therefore evolution is a crock."" or ""Look how amazing this is... there's no way THAT happened by accident!"".  Apparently this dentist musician biology undergraduate has never actually learned the most basic principles of science and natural selection. It insults the intelligence with his pathetic attempt to rationalize  what he was taught as a child and is unwilling to shake.  Very shallow, a bad excuse for science, not recommended and especially dangerous for kids who might actually believe some of the stuff.  They should change the title to "" Incredibly Ridiculous Pseudo-scientific  Beliefs that Defy Knowledge, Reason and Overwhelming Evidence"".",1134950400,36,783,5.491666666666666
173587,4,0970742231,"Three weeks ago I reviewed the first DVD in a series produced by Reel Productions. I very much enjoyed Incredible Creatures That Defy Evolution I and was eager to see the sequel. I was glad to see that volume II is every bit the quality production of its predecessor. In fact, it is probably just a little bit better.

My only complaint about the first volume is that there was perhaps a little too much still photography and not enough video. This was resolved in volume 2. This episode is packed full of amazingly detailed video showing some of God's most amazing creatures.

The Incredible Creatures That Defy Evolution series is hosted by David Hames and features commentary and narration by Dr. Jobe Martin, a former evolutionist who is now a convinced creationist. The format is much the same as in the first video. David Hames introduces a segment (with humor that will probably appeal more to children than adults) and Dr. Martin then provides the story of an incredible creature. At times it seemed to me that in his enthusiasm he may have lost track of the purpose of the production, which was not merely to discuss God's amazing creatures, but to show how they defy evolution. This was more clear in the previous volume. Of course there is still much to learn here about whales, fireflies, glowworms, hippos, sparrows and many other animals.

As with the previous video I highly recommend this one and feel this is a great addition to any library - public, school, church or personal. It is enjoyable for just about any age group, from small children (my five-year old enjoyed it) to adults.",1121731200,20,1602,4.714285714285714
173588,1,0970742231,"I cant believe this..... thousands of years of progress and now we start heading backwards.... if it were up to people like the producers and viewers of this DVD we never would've had the technology to make DVDs!!!!!
Idiots might disagree and make a stupid claim that technology has nothing to do with evolution (or science for that matter). But if the divine is the explanation for everything, then the periodic table would not exist ('Water is too perfect to be a simple cobination of Hydrogen and Oxygen'.... 'they're both gas' the Intelligent designers would claim). We'd be taught that the earth is the center of the Universe (why qestion the bible?) and so on and so forth.",1107216000,35,679,4.762711864406779
173589,5,0970742231,These videos are some of the best I have seen on the topic. They leave very little wriggle room for those who espouse Darwinian evolution. There HAS to be an Intelligent Designer.,1394409600,,179,4.625
173590,5,0970742231,We originally saw this on Netflix.  I've seen some terrible shows that try to justify evolution and make it coexist with creationism rather than just going by what the Bible says.  This show completely debunks the evolutionist theories in very clear and logical methods.  The best part is that the main individual in this show was once a believer in evolution and taught it to others.  Now he teaches creationism and explains why.  Fantastic! I strongly recommend seeing the entire series.  We bought this one as a gift but we will undoubtedly get the full series for ourselves.,1382400000,2,578,4.846938775510204
173591,5,0970742231,"I heard Dr. Jobe Martin, the biologist who explains these fascinating creatures, speak sometime in the last 10 years, and more recently came across the Incredible Creatures series (though it was probably available when I heard him speak). If you are a solid believer in God, or if you aren't, the 3-disc Incredible Creatures series is equally valuable for all people who are open to the idea.

I will use just three examples here of why the Incredible Creatures series is so great. (The second and third examples actually come from disc 3. I'm only slightly modifying my review of the 3-disc set for Amazon's Disc 2 page.) 1) The Pacific golden plover knows, without demonstration, how to fly 88 hours from the Arctic to Hawaii. It has to be accurate and not mess up by even a degree, or it will die. Thus this skill couldn't evolve by trial and error, because it has to be gotten right the first time! 2) The mussel's means of reproduction is for its larvae to imitate a fish's bait, so that the larvae will be snatched by the fish and grow within it for several weeks. This also had to be gotten right the first time, instead of learned over time by trial and error and gradual stages of evolution, or the mussel would be extinct. 3) The main creature that knows how to pollinate the vanilla orchid is the Melipona bee, and the vanilla orchid is only open for 2 1/2 to 3 hours before wilting. The Melipona bee pollinates the vanilla orchid so the vanilla bean can grow. The vanilla orchid needs the Melipona bee to survive. According to the beginning of Genesis in the Bible, all life was originally created in short succession, not millions of years. These two life forms (the vanilla orchid and Melipona bee) were made for each other, Jobe Martin argues.

Dr. Jobe Martin uses several principles in this series to refute evolution. (Note to skeptics: He was trained to be an evolutionist and studied biology and dentistry with that in mind. His journey away from evolutionary thinking was gradual and the result of being convinced by evidence.) Among these principles are:
1) Survival has to be gotten right the first time, in many cases. Evolution by trial and error or slow mutations could never produce success under that kind of pressure.
2) Genetic material is never gained, always lost. Therefore we know from genetic science that evolution to higher forms is not possible. There are over 700 varieties of dogs because genetic information has been narrowed/lost.
3) Where are the missing links/transitional forms between species? Why are new creatures not showing up? Why would we have to worry about endangered species if new creatures were constantly emerging by evolution?
4) The interdependence of the earth's ecosystem (for example, photosynthesis - plants need animals, and animals and people need plants), and of the components/processes within an individual creature, demands that all the components be there at once. Gradual evolution doesn't work.
5) How could impersonal forces create intelligence by accident? Chemicals are not ideas/intelligence.
6) Explosions (the Big Bang) create chaos, not order!
7) Evolution is speculative philosophy/metaphysical naturalism, and cannot be determined by forensic science (fossils) or operational science (reproducible, experimentally verifiable laboratory work). Evolution is not science. It is a way science/data is interpreted.

This series is one of the few things I would say is a MUST see. I can't recommend it strongly enough.",1372464000,2,3494,5.0
173592,5,0970742231,"I had no idea how much care and thought God put into making the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and even creepy crawly things.  It's evident that God is especially fond of ALL His creatures.  What a WONDERFUL God I serve!",1367280000,,232,4.133333333333334
173593,5,0970742231,"Incredible Creatures that Defy Evolution II contains amazing and fun critter facts and places the authors encourage research! The following are a few examples of the amazing creatures in the video.  Humming birds are tiny and use lots of energy, but they can migrate across an ocean.  We should learn how these birds do it and use it on airplanes and cars.  Fireflies and glowworms make cool heat; can we do it as cheaply as they do and save money?  How does regeneration work in some creatures; can we figure it out and get someone to grow a new arm or nose?  This is a fun video and asks many questions. Living beings are incredible, and this video gives a fun taste of awesome life here on Earth!",1363996800,,699,4.4296875

173596,5,0970742231,"This film (as well as the two others in the set) is a complete delight, with enough interesting, scientific facts to captivate intelligent adults, while being entertaining enough for younger school-aged children. Undoubtedly, any creature could have been used as a subject since the complexity of a single cell alone is mind-boggling, but the animals used as subjects in this series all have multiple God-given features that refute the myths of natural selection, survival of the fittest, and other evolutionary myths. A former evolutionist myself at one time, this film strengthens one's appreciation of our awesome Creator.

As an aside to all the individuals who have swallowed Carl Sagan's delusion that evolution is scientific fact, there is precious little true science in evolution theory; evolution is actually an atheistic religion developed to keep God out of the equation and, thus, requires much more faith to adhere to its tenets than does Christianity. Evolution theory's claims have been scientifically refuted but their lies continue to be printed in textbooks so that more people can be brainwashed. I would recommend seeing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Expelled-No-Intelligence-Allowed/dp/B001BYLFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed</a>&nbsp;and also the excellent series ""Have You Swallowed the Hook?"" on youtube. Using sophistries such as the idea that change takes place over millions of years equates to ""once upon a time"" thinking and shows evolution in the light of what it really is: a fairy tale.",1352764800,4,1596,5.909090909090909
173597,5,0970742231,"If a person really looks at this piece of work and truly attempts to be subjective they will find that at no point is there a subjective view presented.  One of the very first points is made about the Bombardier Beetle that has been proven to be untrue and identified many years prior to this commercial for Christians.  I challenge all who decide to watch this to do a simple google search of the subject and then subjectively analyse the content, if that is possible.  If a person is able to subjectively look at the information they will find this work to be laughable.  I think it does a great Job at looking silly, hence the 5 stars.",1314576000,4,638,4.38135593220339
