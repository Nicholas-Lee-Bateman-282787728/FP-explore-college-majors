5643684,5,B00BLN4UVU,"good show. Can tell Eric Fleming is tiring of his role. Still will complete collection. Nice,clear picture quality compared to other shows from that period.",1374451200,2,156,5.28
5643685,5,B00BLN4UVU,"My wife and I love Rawhide with the great stories, guest stars and the stars themselves.  It does not get any better than this.",1372550400,5,127,4.291666666666667
5643686,5,B00BLN4UVU,"Love all of Rawhide, just wish they would realize Eric Fleming was THE star of the show.  He died early in his career so everyone thinks Clint Eastwood was the star, but he wasn't.  Will buy Season seven, but not season eight.",1372377600,13,226,4.357142857142857
5643687,5,B00BLN4UVU,"Continuing the mostly solid sixth season, these 15 episodes feature excellent performances by the series regulars as well as the guest stars. CBS and show producers learned quickly in the first season never to allow the guest stars to overshadow the regulars and here all work in concert for satisfying results. Though mostly town-bound, Episode 15 in volume one featured Paul Brinegar as trail drive cook George Washington (Wish) Wishbone in a humorous shotgun-wedding in the making tale. Episode 16 in this volume again features Wish, but this time it is a deadly serious and intriguing tale in which we learn more of the character's background. It also shows the deep bond the drovers have developed over their long odyssey. The only real letdown is the season finale which features Robert Cabal as the superstitious remuda wrangler Hey-Soos and guest star James Gregory as a saint-sinner trying to persuade a strange Indian tribe he led them astray. Side-note:  According to author David R. Greenland the CBS suits were leery of permitting the character to be billed as ""Jesus"" even though that is the proper spelling of the Spanish name. Instead they insisted it be spelled as pronounced - Hey-Soos. Another side-note: During the premier run of ""Rawhide"" Eric Fleming as Gil Favor was the acknowledged star. Clint Eastwood was a co-star. Since CBS-TV began releasing these DVDs the cover art has featured Eastwood with Fleming in the background. First time viewers with no history of the series may be confused why. This is a modern merchandising technique to boost sales since 50-odd years after the first run Eastwood has been an international celebrity for decades while Fleming, who died September 28, 1966 in a raging Amazonian river while filming a TV movie, is mostly forgotten.",1372204800,13,1790,5.067796610169491
