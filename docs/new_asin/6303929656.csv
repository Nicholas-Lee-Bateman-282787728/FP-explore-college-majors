In ""The Secret of Dagger Rock"", the evil magic collector Mozenrath kidnaps Aladdin and Jasmine and demands Genie as ransom! Then, all of a sudden, he frees Jasmine - after all, the ""little princess"" couldn't be a threat to him! Obviously, Mozenrath doesn't know Jasmine!  This episode is just great.  Jasmine proves why she's one my top 3 Disney Princesses, & there are some incredibly funny moments from Genie (the history of man & the wrestling match are priceless).  A+

Then, in ""Forget Me Lots"", Abis Mal tries to gain power over the Sultan with the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness. But, when an unknowing Aladdin gives Jasmine the rose as a corsage, she loses her memory - and finds a whole new career as the head of Abis Mal's gang! Can anyone stop her from overthrowing the palace?  A clich plot is given a fresh twist, & results in a pretty good episode.  B+

This is much better than the last one I reviewed.",1365552000,2,969,4.497142857142857
7857194,3,6303929656,"Don't let it fool you that this 2 episode video is deemed part of the Disney ""Princess Collection"".  It caters more to the action-oriented than to fans of sweet fairy tales.  My 5-year-old twin daughters tend to favor the latter.  Personally, I am ok with the stories but I thought I should warn others that the villians can be pretty scary and there are periods of intense cartoon violence (hitting, slugging, sword fighting, etc.)
