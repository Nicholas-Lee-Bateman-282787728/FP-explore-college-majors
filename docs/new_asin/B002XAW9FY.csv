8383581,3,B002XAW9FY,Poses rather routine and not real valuable for anyone who has been taking Yoga regularly. Disappointed in content of DVD.,1383436800,,121,5.1
8383582,4,B002XAW9FY,Have used Lilias's yoga since 1971. I bought this for my brother with hope him and his wife might give yoga a try.,1363305600,,114,4.0
8383583,1,B002XAW9FY,"This is not a DVD that will give you a Yoga workout. Between the 2 discs, there might be 15 minutes of actual exercise. It's hard to tell just how much time I spent exercising because it seemed like I spent more time fast forwarding, rewinding and changing the disc looking for more yoga. I couldn't believe I actually spent 28.00 (of course, not eligible for free shipping) on this bomb. After way too much time searching, I just put on a Rodney Yi DVD and got down to doing some yoga! This review site made me pick at least a 1 star rating. I would give it zero stars.",1362009600,,570,4.1909090909090905
