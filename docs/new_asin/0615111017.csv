7788129,5,0615111017,"My 3 years old son has been fascinated about tractors since he was 1 years old. ... This one I purchased him for last Christmas and he loves it a lot. I like the narration of this film, because it is realistic, without any stupid stunts, but still it is interesting for a young child. This farm has a lot of really big equipment and that is what my son loves!!",1029110400,,360,4.084507042253521
7788130,4,0615111017,"Frank Hurley is best-known as the photographer and filmmaker of Earnest Shakleton's amazing Antarctic expedition which began in 1914.  After surviving the Antarctic trip, Hurley continued making films of unexplored regions of the world.  This video covers his entire career and includes great footage of Hurley's first expedition to Antarctica, the Shakleton expedition, and his later expeditions to Papua, New Guinea and the interior of Australia.  However, if you're interested in this video for the footage of the Shakleton expedition, be warned that the Antarctic footage only comprises about one-third of this film. At least half of the film focuses on Hurley's filmmaking career later in his life.",977702400,,703,5.4907407407407405
