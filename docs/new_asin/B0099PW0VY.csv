8538111,5,B0099PW0VY,Sarah is an amazing yoga and mindfulness teacher. If you are a yoga teacher this is a good DVD to help you learn the words for teaching yin yoga and go deeper within yourself.,1414454400,,175,4.176470588235294
8538112,4,B0099PW0VY,"I really enjoy these but am partial to her previous Insight yoga DVD. I prefer her to be speaking directly as she performs the poses than the presentation on this video. I also wish there was more support on the meditations as in her previous DVD. I really miss a longer shamata and more of her vast knowledge on different breathing styles to use. This presentation just does not make me feel part of her class as previous and that is what I enjoy. She has great information as always though and I hope she produces more soon for those of us with families and wish we could travel to see her but are constrained by time, finances, etc.",1381104000,8,635,4.34453781512605
8538113,4,B0099PW0VY,"NOTE:  I received free copies of each of these two DVDs to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews.

The two DVDs in this set were each previously released individually; see also my reviews for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insight-Yoga-Heaven/dp/B0076L0ROU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insight Yoga Heaven</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insight-Yoga-Earth/dp/B0076L0S30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insight Yoga Earth</a>.  Both DVDs feature yoga instructor Sara Powers and her husband, Ty Powers, founders of the Insight Yoga Institute. The DVD inserts explain that Insight Yoga involves a balance between the lower body, which is the earthy or ""Yin"" region, and the upper body, the heavenly or ""Yang"" region.

In Insight Yoga Heaven, the focus is on the relationship between the earth-based energy, which represents stability, and balancing the opening of Yang energy in the upper body.  The DVD offers the following practice options:
~Practice Overview (9 min; audio only)
~Strengthening the Lung Chi (65 min)
~Ground Support: Breathing Into the Hara (45 min)
~Meditation Practice: Karuna Meditation (16 min)

In Insight Yoga Earth, the emphasis is on drawing strength from the ""hara,"" or the belly center. Both the two yoga practices and the two meditations on this DVD focus on deriving energy from the hara to nourish the entire body.  There are several practice and meditation options on this DVD:
~Practice Overview (9 min; audio only)
~Grounding Down (55 min)
~Spiraling the Universal Chi (31 min)
~Shamata Meditation (20 min)
~Vipassana Meditation (18 min)

Powers has a soothing manner in these practices, and those who have enjoyed her previous work will likely enjoy this DVD as well. On the other hand, those familiar with other styles of yoga might have some difficulties connecting with her approach.  In particular, there were a few things about Powers' presentation that I didn't like. First, although the inclusion of the ""om mani padme hum"" mantra was potentially an excellent tool for breath regulation, Powers frequently talks over the mantra, making it difficult to hear. Second, the meditation practices are quite lengthy, especially for those new to meditation; Powers might have better served her viewers a by offering shorter options.",1360022400,8,2374,5.93841642228739
