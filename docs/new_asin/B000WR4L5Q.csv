2990444,5,B000WR4L5Q,"The great Christian apologist GK Chesterton once remarked that the trouble with so much modern art and literature (he was thinking of Ibsen etc.) was that it had a great knowledge of hell but no knowledge of heaven - unlike writers of the past such as Dante. I think however that he would have approved this beautifully shot, well acted and inspiring film. Although Maria Goretti's life was tragically short and filled with so much pain and hardship, nevertheless, within it, she created a niche of light, a way towards redemption. This film captures this very well.

The young actress that plays Maria is convincing and enchanting. The young Italian saint serves as an inspiration to everyone of how we can find heaven in often hellish situations. I watched this film whilst I was sick in bed and felt refreshed at the end. It reminded me of the Ignatian principle of contemplating those things that are life giving - Ignatius himself learned this principle when he was recovering from the wounds of war.

Some of the best sorts of films and books are those that make you look at life anew and see what goodness you can bring to the world. This was one of the first films I watched this year and could well end up being the best.

Please buy and watch.

As an English viewer I am curious why these and other similar films are not available in the UK.",1233878400,5,1351,4.5473251028806585

2990446,2,B000WR4L5Q,"Very dull, no real insight. Maria Goretti's great act is of forgiveness and of how she lived in God's love despite a hard childhood, NOT that she fended off a rapist. What female wouldn't do as well. Maria's story is of reconciliation, peace, and love for all. Acting was poor, and I found the actress who played Maria to be the weakest.",1212710400,8,337,4.451612903225806
2990447,5,B000WR4L5Q,"This movie of Maria Goretti gives an impressing insight into the saint's and martyr's life. The film shows that Maria was a natural and friendly girl with many talents and a deep love for God and her family. She resisted strongly the sexual expectations of Alessandro Serenelli who tried to abuse her. The young man didn't want to give up and became her murderer, but she forgave him and showed an example of love and mercy. I highly recommend this movie to believers and non-believers!",1207699200,8,486,4.729411764705882
2990448,5,B000WR4L5Q,"I am addicted to this movie.  I remember seeing a movie about Maria Goretti in Catholic grade school - but only once.  I should have been made to see it over and over and the teachers should have made the students discuss it over and over.  The music, scenery and the wretchedness of the times are overwhelming.  I have tried to find more information on the actors but there is little.

Please read Allessandro Serenellis final letter which I did found.

""I'm nearly 80 years old. I'm about to depart.
Looking back at my past, I can see that in my early youth, I chose a bad path which led me to ruin myself.

My behavior was influenced by print, mass-media and bad examples which are followed by the majority of young people without even thinking. And I did the same. I was not worried.

There were a lot of generous and devoted people who surrounded me, but I paid no attention to them because a violent force blinded me and pushed me toward a wrong way of life.

When I was 20 years-old, I committed a crime of passion. Now, that memory represents something horrible for me. Maria Goretti, now a Saint, was my good Angel, sent to me through Providence to guide and save me.

I still have impressed upon my heart her words of rebuke and of pardon. She prayed for me, she interceded for her murderer. Thirty years of prison followed.
If I had been of age, I would have spent all my life in prison. I accepted to be condemned because it was my own fault.

Little Maria was really my light, my protectress; with her help, I behaved well during the 27 years of prison and tried to live honestly when I was again accepted among the members of society.

The Brothers of St. Francis, Capuchins from Marche, welcomed me with angelic charity into their monastery as a brother, not as a servant. I've been living with their community for 24 years, and now I am serenely waiting to witness the vision of God, to hug my loved ones again, and to be next to my Guardian Angel and her dear mother, Assunta.

I hope this letter that I wrote can teach others the happy lesson of avoiding evil and of always following the right path, like little children.
I feel that religion with its precepts is not something we can live without, but rather it is the real comfort, the real strength in life and the only safe way in every circumstance, even the most painful ones of life.""

Signature, Alessandro Serenelli",1206662400,64,2392,4.419134396355353
2990449,4,B000WR4L5Q,"This was generally a good video to share with tweens and teens. The translation into English was a bit awkward. It would probably be best to watch it in Italian with English subtitles. We watched it in English with English subtitles (don't ask) and because the mouths did not necessarily move in sync with the translation we got a real ""Jackie Chan effect."" Also, I was surprised that Maria was pictured on her first Communion day wearing white when she is reportedly supposed to have worn red (the red was so much more significant). Anyhow, besides these two negative remarks the film was very good and the character Maria was excellent along with the supporting characters.",1198800000,16,675,4.827586206896552

2990451,5,B000WR4L5Q,"I was really impressed and moved by this film. It uses some artistic liberty in telling the story of Maria Goretti but it remains faithful to the core of her life. Some films based on lives of Saints will take an unreal approach to its story and characters and I sort of expected it here, so I was really surprised by the strength of the writing, character development, and acting! Each member of the cast fully realizes his/her character. And even though you know and expect the ending, when it comes, you can't help but cry. It's a very touching and powerful portrait of Maria Goretti.",1195862400,36,587,4.547169811320755
2990452,5,B000WR4L5Q,"This is another very moving film in the growing group of inspiring, well made feature films on lives of saints produced in Italy, and released in the USA by Ignatius Press. Young Italian actress Martina Pinto gives a luminous performance as St. Maria Goretti, the daughter of outstanding parents who struggle heroically to raise their children amidst the poverty and malaria infested swamps in Italy. She epitomizes that purity and goodness that have been strongly associated with this martyr and patroness of modern youth. Popular actor Flavio Insinna (St. John Bosco) stars as the brave parish priest standing up against the injustices to the poor who takes the Goretti family under his wing. Well-known glamorous Italian actress Claudia Koll, who has had a major spiritual conversion in her own personal life, starts as the Countess Mazzoleni.
  The powerful movie is beautifully filmed on location with outstanding cinematography. A real bonus in this film is the gorgeous music score by legendary Oscar winning film composer Ennio Morricone. Plus the DVD includes a very informative 16 page collector's booklet about Maria Goretti and the film, replete with numerous photos from the film.

2990466,5,B000WR4L5Q,"This 2003 film, only 105 minutes long, tells the real life story of St. Maria Goretti, a 12-year old Catholic girl who was killed in 1902 by a 19-year old neighbor boy named Alessandro who stabbed her 14 times after she resisted his rape attempts. The Catholic Church subsequently declared her a saint for one thing only: She forgave her would-be rapist and murderer on her deathbed, leading to his own conversion back to God. Maria's mother and murderer (who ultimately died in 1970 as a brother in a religious order) attended her canonization in 1950, when Pope Pius XII also declared Maria the patron saint of modern youth. Among all of the Italian saint movies released to the US market by Ignatius Press, this film is one of the best, and is full of beautiful music (by Andrea and Ennio Morricone) as well as scenery. The young Italian actress who plays Maria is surprisingly charismatic. To appreciate her performance, I strongly recommend viewing the film in its original Italian with English subtitles, rather than exercising the option of a poorly done English dubbed track on the DVD.

A Passionist priest who was Maria Goretti's pastor figures heavily into the plot, which movingly portrays the social and political winds that produced widespread poverty on the Italian farmlands, particularly the malaria outbreak that killed Maria's own dad when she was nine. The priest, Father Basilio, has some sharp exchanges with the local landowner, an Italian count who refused to pay for quinine to cure his workers of the malaria. An early exchange where the count accuses Father Basilio of being a socialist and Father Basilio responds by citing Pope Leo XIII's ""Rerum Novarum"" encyclical is sharply observed, witnessing to the controversial birth of Catholic social thought. The film spends a lot of time introducing us to the workers and their plight, while depicting the count as confident they will not rebel because both sides depend on the success of the land, owner and serfs alike. If all of this sounds episodic, it's actually quite relevant to Maria's story, as it sets out for us the desperate social setting that led her desperate neighbor to assault her. It's ultimately a sad movie about one girl's efforts to hold onto the ideals of her faith despite the crushing reality of poverty that puts her in greater danger than she knows.

As with most Ignatius Press films, there is a booklet of background information included with the disc, wherein the film is presented in widescreen without any special features on the disc other than language options. Despite the highly emotional subject matter of a 12-year old martyr who died resisting rape, melodramatic flourishes are kept to a (relative) minimum, and there's nothing cheesy in any of the plot points as one finds in many other films of this genre. If there's any downside to the film, it's the relentless sadness of the whole affair, which fails to be alleviated by the curt words of forgiveness and pealing bells that accompany Maria's saintly death. The movie's dominant mood is one of sadness, poverty, and despair. Stopping short of being truly inspirational or uplifting, ""Maria Goretti"" gives us the facts of an essentially sad story in an even sadder cultural context. It's a good film, but not great or exceptionally memorable. It is also not necessarily the best film about a saint to show young children in religious education, as kids of Maria's age may not be edified by all of the mature themes presented here.",1401494400,3,3498,4.9271186440677965
2990467,5,B000WR4L5Q,Maria Goretti was a young girl who loved Jesus so much she would rather be killed than to go against her committment to the Lord to be chaste her whole life.  She is now a saint.  Very good movie,1397088000,2,195,3.9743589743589745

2990475,3,B000WR4L5Q,"I didn't know about Maria Goretti until some years ago, when I read a story about her.  She was a young girl of 13 or 14, and one day, she had to make a choice. Being raped or stabbed to death.  She was a devoted Catholic, so she chose the latter, forgiving the young man before she died.  The film was good, but I thought it could have been better.  She was considered to be a beautiful child,(there are no photographs) and the actress who portrayed her did an excellent job. There was a lot of fear she had to live with, though she never told her mother the reason why. But this was a religious film, so I suppose they were limited by how intense it could be.",1365552000,3,661,4.10077519379845

Maria Goretti is the ideal role model for all young people today in this culture of sin. Before I purchased it, I was a bit discouraged by all of the negative reviews on Amazon.com. However, I was not dissapointed once I viewed this beautiful film. The whole thing is outstanding! The acting is excellent and the gorgeous soundtrack matches the emotions of each scene. (sad music for tragic scenes, suspenseful music for frightening scenes, etc.) I could compile a long list on why I love this movie! It is very much appropriate for teens and tweens.

2990482,4,B000WR4L5Q,"This movie shows the realism of living in poverty in Italy during her time.  The movie is dubbed from Italian, and the pacing is quite slow by US standards.  Knowing that she would be martyred in the end makes the movie almost exquisitely painful to watch, as the young actress who plays Maria is adorable, sunny and compelling.  I previewed this movie to decide whether my daughter, an 11-year-old Maria Goretti fan, could see it.  I decided it was too heart-wrenching for my daughter, and she has not yet seen it.  I am not certain whether a middle-schooler would be less bothered than I was, but I guess that would depend on how sensitive they are.  Certainly, the movie was compelling enough that it is easy to relate to the young girl, so I can imagine that the movie would be upsetting to some young people.  The difficult subject matter of the attempted rape was dealt with quite elegantly and without vulgarity.  Maria's deep faith and unwavering strength of character are clearly portrayed and inspirational.

I would suggest that this movie is appropriate for high school students if accompanied with a sensitive discussion of the subject matter.  More sheltered or sensitive middle schoolers might find this movie quite upsetting.",1355184000,6,1241,4.894736842105263

A poorly-written script that deflated quickly after the first ten minutes.  There were many inconsistencies where the writer took too many liberties with the actual story.  It seems that an Italian-made movie about an Italian saint would be a more accurate tribute.  It was a made-for-TV movie in Italy, and maybe that's the explanation, however, this had the potential to be a much finer presentation.",1247097600,17,626,5.1683168316831685

When he finally did murder her, not receiving from her what he most wanted, she forgave him and went to Heaven.
The acting in this video is superbly done; I had never heard of any of the actors; I went merely on the notion that this was a movie about one of my favorite Saints...and I was not disappointed.
Even tho' it is Italian, with English dubbed in, as I watched it this didn't bother me at all; I even forgot for the most part that I was watching a foreign film.

3224941,5,B000WR4L5Q,"The great Christian apologist GK Chesterton once remarked that the trouble with so much modern art and literature (he was thinking of Ibsen etc.) was that it had a great knowledge of hell but no knowledge of heaven - unlike writers of the past such as Dante. I think however that he would have approved this beautifully shot, well acted and inspiring film. Although Maria Goretti's life was tragically short and filled with so much pain and hardship, nevertheless, within it, she created a niche of light, a way towards redemption. This film captures this very well.

The young actress that plays Maria is convincing and enchanting. The young Italian saint serves as an inspiration to everyone of how we can find heaven in often hellish situations. I watched this film whilst I was sick in bed and felt refreshed at the end. It reminded me of the Ignatian principle of contemplating those things that are life giving - Ignatius himself learned this principle when he was recovering from the wounds of war.

Some of the best sorts of films and books are those that make you look at life anew and see what goodness you can bring to the world. This was one of the first films I watched this year and could well end up being the best.

I have tried to find more information on the actors but there is little.

Please read Allessandro Serenellis final letter which I did found.

""I'm nearly 80 years old. I'm about to depart.
Looking back at my past, I can see that in my early youth, I chose a bad path which led me to ruin myself.

My behavior was influenced by print, mass-media and bad examples which are followed by the majority of young people without even thinking. And I did the same. I was not worried.

There were a lot of generous and devoted people who surrounded me, but I paid no attention to them because a violent force blinded me and pushed me toward a wrong way of life.

When I was 20 years-old, I committed a crime of passion. Now, that memory represents something horrible for me. Maria Goretti, now a Saint, was my good Angel, sent to me through Providence to guide and save me.

I still have impressed upon my heart her words of rebuke and of pardon. She prayed for me, she interceded for her murderer. Thirty years of prison followed.
If I had been of age, I would have spent all my life in prison. I accepted to be condemned because it was my own fault.

Little Maria was really my light, my protectress; with her help, I behaved well during the 27 years of prison and tried to live honestly when I was again accepted among the members of society.

The Brothers of St. Francis, Capuchins from Marche, welcomed me with angelic charity into their monastery as a brother, not as a servant. I've been living with their community for 24 years, and now I am serenely waiting to witness the vision of God, to hug my loved ones again, and to be next to my Guardian Angel and her dear mother, Assunta.

I hope this letter that I wrote can teach others the happy lesson of avoiding evil and of always following the right path, like little children.
I feel that religion with its precepts is not something we can live without, but rather it is the real comfort, the real strength in life and the only safe way in every circumstance, even the most painful ones of life.""

3224946,4,B000WR4L5Q,"This was generally a good video to share with tweens and teens. The translation into English was a bit awkward. It would probably be best to watch it in Italian with English subtitles. We watched it in English with English subtitles (don't ask) and because the mouths did not necessarily move in sync with the translation we got a real ""Jackie Chan effect."" Also, I was surprised that Maria was pictured on her first Communion day wearing white when she is reportedly supposed to have worn red (the red was so much more significant). Anyhow, besides these two negative remarks the film was very good and the character Maria was excellent along with the supporting characters.",1198800000,16,675,4.827586206896552

Some films based on lives of Saints will take an unreal approach to its story and characters and I sort of expected it here, so I was really surprised by the strength of the writing, character development, and acting! Each member of the cast fully realizes his/her character. And even though you know and expect the ending, when it comes, you can't help but cry. It's a very touching and powerful portrait of Maria Goretti.",1195862400,36,587,4.547169811320755
3224949,5,B000WR4L5Q,"This is another very moving film in the growing group of inspiring, well made feature films on lives of saints produced in Italy, and released in the USA by Ignatius Press. Young Italian actress Martina Pinto gives a luminous performance as St. Maria Goretti, the daughter of outstanding parents who struggle heroically to raise their children amidst the poverty and malaria infested swamps in Italy. She epitomizes that purity and goodness that have been strongly associated with this martyr and patroness of modern youth. Popular actor Flavio Insinna (St. John Bosco) stars as the brave parish priest standing up against the injustices to the poor who takes the Goretti family under his wing. Well-known glamorous Italian actress Claudia Koll, who has had a major spiritual conversion in her own personal life, starts as the Countess Mazzoleni.
  The powerful movie is beautifully filmed on location with outstanding cinematography. A real bonus in this film is the gorgeous music score by legendary Oscar winning film composer Ennio Morricone. Plus the DVD includes a very informative 16 page collector's booklet about Maria Goretti and the film, replete with numerous photos from the film.

3224963,5,B000WR4L5Q,"This 2003 film, only 105 minutes long, tells the real life story of St. Maria Goretti, a 12-year old Catholic girl who was killed in 1902 by a 19-year old neighbor boy named Alessandro who stabbed her 14 times after she resisted his rape attempts. The Catholic Church subsequently declared her a saint for one thing only: She forgave her would-be rapist and murderer on her deathbed, leading to his own conversion back to God. Maria's mother and murderer (who ultimately died in 1970 as a brother in a religious order) attended her canonization in 1950, when Pope Pius XII also declared Maria the patron saint of modern youth. Among all of the Italian saint movies released to the US market by Ignatius Press, this film is one of the best, and is full of beautiful music (by Andrea and Ennio Morricone) as well as scenery. The young Italian actress who plays Maria is surprisingly charismatic. To appreciate her performance, I strongly recommend viewing the film in its original Italian with English subtitles, rather than exercising the option of a poorly done English dubbed track on the DVD.

A Passionist priest who was Maria Goretti's pastor figures heavily into the plot, which movingly portrays the social and political winds that produced widespread poverty on the Italian farmlands, particularly the malaria outbreak that killed Maria's own dad when she was nine. The priest, Father Basilio, has some sharp exchanges with the local landowner, an Italian count who refused to pay for quinine to cure his workers of the malaria. An early exchange where the count accuses Father Basilio of being a socialist and Father Basilio responds by citing Pope Leo XIII's ""Rerum Novarum"" encyclical is sharply observed, witnessing to the controversial birth of Catholic social thought. The film spends a lot of time introducing us to the workers and their plight, while depicting the count as confident they will not rebel because both sides depend on the success of the land, owner and serfs alike. If all of this sounds episodic, it's actually quite relevant to Maria's story, as it sets out for us the desperate social setting that led her desperate neighbor to assault her. It's ultimately a sad movie about one girl's efforts to hold onto the ideals of her faith despite the crushing reality of poverty that puts her in greater danger than she knows.

As with most Ignatius Press films, there is a booklet of background information included with the disc, wherein the film is presented in widescreen without any special features on the disc other than language options. Despite the highly emotional subject matter of a 12-year old martyr who died resisting rape, melodramatic flourishes are kept to a (relative) minimum, and there's nothing cheesy in any of the plot points as one finds in many other films of this genre. If there's any downside to the film, it's the relentless sadness of the whole affair, which fails to be alleviated by the curt words of forgiveness and pealing bells that accompany Maria's saintly death. The movie's dominant mood is one of sadness, poverty, and despair. Stopping short of being truly inspirational or uplifting, ""Maria Goretti"" gives us the facts of an essentially sad story in an even sadder cultural context. It's a good film, but not great or exceptionally memorable. It is also not necessarily the best film about a saint to show young children in religious education, as kids of Maria's age may not be edified by all of the mature themes presented here.",1401494400,3,3498,4.9271186440677965

Being raped or stabbed to death.  She was a devoted Catholic, so she chose the latter, forgiving the young man before she died.  The film was good, but I thought it could have been better.  She was considered to be a beautiful child,(there are no photographs) and the actress who portrayed her did an excellent job. There was a lot of fear she had to live with, though she never told her mother the reason why.

Knowing that she would be martyred in the end makes the movie almost exquisitely painful to watch, as the young actress who plays Maria is adorable, sunny and compelling.  I previewed this movie to decide whether my daughter, an 11-year-old Maria Goretti fan, could see it.  I decided it was too heart-wrenching for my daughter, and she has not yet seen it.  I am not certain whether a middle-schooler would be less bothered than I was, but I guess that would depend on how sensitive they are.  Certainly, the movie was compelling enough that it is easy to relate to the young girl, so I can imagine that the movie would be upsetting to some young people.  The difficult subject matter of the attempted rape was dealt with quite elegantly and without vulgarity.  Maria's deep faith and unwavering strength of character are clearly portrayed and inspirational.

I would suggest that this movie is appropriate for high school students if accompanied with a sensitive discussion of the subject matter.  More sheltered or sensitive middle schoolers might find this movie quite upsetting.",1355184000,6,1241,4.894736842105263
