8497332,3,B006G1WL22,"A slow moving movie with an uninteresting plot.
Some of the football team were not allowed to play on the team because they took and hid a backpack of
a new player.  This action was built up as a serious offense, when teens do such pranks on new football
players often.
I don't recommend this film.",1386288000,,298,4.321428571428571
