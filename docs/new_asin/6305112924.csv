966511,5,6305112924,This heart-warming film is great.  My friend's 5 year old daughter is the spittin' image of Savannah.  I wanted her to see the film while she still is...  But it isn't in the video rental stores anymore or for sale.  I'm  disappointed.  I'm learning a lesson about videos.  If you love it you  better buy it while it is out.,942710400,2,324,4.283333333333333

966763,3,6305112924,This is a very good family movie.  Bridgette Anderson is feeling unloved and runs away.  She hides out in a car that two criminals have stolen.  And the next thing you know they start caring and looking out for her.  I did not know until a few years ago that Bridgette Andersen died of an over dose.  She should have grown up and been a big name star.  But instead turned out to be a True Hollyood story.,1517788800,,404,4.115384615384615

There is only a grindy sound - old, old picture - the movie is unwatchable.  I wish I could return it, regardless of the window.  It was a family favorite when my kids grew up and I was excited to get it again.  VERY DISAPPOINTED the quality was poor, poor, poor - unwatchable.",1511654400,,424,4.0602409638554215

966833,5,6305112924,"Great little movie, darling child actress played by Bridgette Andersen... And Mark Miller and Donovan Scott, the Laurel and Hardy of the movie, will keep you in stitches!  But break out the Kleen-Xs at the end, it's precious.  The movie came out in 1982 and for some reason, never hit the TV re-runs... and so finally, after all this time, I broke down and bought the DVD...it's a great movie at twice the price!

966931,5,6305112924,I remember watching this movie in 1982 and it's a very heart warming tale about a little girl who runs away and ends up softening the hearts of 2 criminals who are on the run as well! It was shot in the Wasatch Mountain area of the old Bridal Veil Falls area in Utah. She ran away because her parents are too busy for her and she feels sad and ignored by them.,1492819200,,360,3.9452054794520546

967130,3,6305112924,"Back in 1982 I thought it was one of the greatest of movies.  I bought it now to show my granddaughters, but we all grew bored and stopped watching about a half-hour into it.  Sadly, today's viewers are addicted to non-stop action, and I've realized I have fallen that way too.  The ""bad"" cops are too over-the-top eager-to-kill-the-possible-bad-guys.  Yes, there are such cops, but it felt offensively comic here.  Yes, it's a comedy, but what was laughable 34 years ago doesn't always carry forward.  Maybe I'm more disappointed in our culture than I am of the movie.",1477267200,2,569,4.814432989690721

967210,5,6305112924,"I bought this dvd because my sister and I watched this movie a lot as kids.  We watched this movie so many times that we wore out the VHS copy that we had (and this movie was out of print for a long time, so I was happy to find it on dvd).

You have a cute little girl who isn't happy at home and decides to run away, and then there are some bumbling crooks who end up as reluctant kidnappers, but the girl sneaks into the backseat of their car and she just happens to end up with the GOOD criminals instead of bad ones.  Pure luck, I'm sure, but I'm glad we didn't try anything quite so dumb as kids.

This movie still has me teary-eyed at the ending.  It's that good.  Worth watching even today--no drugs, sex, or violence.",1474502400,,725,4.034965034965035

One time a mom of one of my friends videotaped the movie for us, so I was able to watch it more than once while growing up. Savannah is such a cutie and steals the screen with her lively personality. A few years ago I checked out the DVD of this movie from the library to watch with a friend. After not seeing it since my childhood, I didn't know if I'd still like the movie as much, but Savannah is such an adorable and heartwarming character and it still remains a favorite movie of mine. I searched online to find out about Bridgette Andersen who played Savannah and I was saddened to see that she passed away in 1997. One year I decided to purchase a copy of the movie on DVD. This weekend I watched it with my niece and nephews and they all enjoyed the movie. It's a movie that is still fun to watch despite it being a movie made over 30 years ago.",1463961600,4,918,4.105555555555555

968038,5,6305112924,"Like a lost well-loved worn out cuddly toy from childhood, you still smile with fondness when you see it once again. This is the original movie. Same super-cute sweetie, same bumbling but endearing crooks, same everything.

It looks like the one who put this out for instant video had a copy of the original VHS or reel and used it to make this one. And I sure am glad he did. This may be grainy. It may have lost some of its color, but it's not garbled or faded too terribly. I suppose if you put this instant video on a big HD flat screen then you'd be seeing pixels, but I just watched it on my iPad and it's just fine for me. See screenshots I added. When I first saw it, I watched it on a 20"" TV. It would still look fine on a smaller flat screen. I have yet to watch it on my big plasma. I may add to this when I have,but my opinion will be the same. If you find a home video that's seen better days, would you love it any less if it lost a bit of color or became a bit grainy?

If you're an HD MOVIE-viewer, please don't rate this poorly on that scale. You wouldn't rate the ""stereo"" quality of a gramophone disc based on the sound you get from an MP3. Instead, view it as you would an old friend you haven't seen in 30 or so years. There's some wear there, but it's the same old friend inside. (And you're no Burt Reynolds or Farrah Fawcett yourself anymore, anyway.)

As for me, it still makes me smile. I'm grateful to take it exactly as it is.",1446336000,6,1454,4.006896551724138

I want my kids who are all grown now to see it & my grand kids. I'm sure they will all like it as much as I do.  I started shopping from amazon about 2 years ago.

My wife is one of those--we got it and she just loved seeing it again.  My daughter and myself--not so much.  Some funny parts, but pretty boring overall.  The worst is that in this high definition world, this is one of the worst transfers I have ever seen.  It looks like someone taped the movie, then downloaded it to a computer, then uploaded it at a lower quality.  GRAINY.  The girl as Savannah is okay--I could barely understand her during her Brer Rabbit story, and the end is quite disappointing.

I was able to see it....but it was not clear....not even as clear as an old video...that I taped.  I know it was used but the seller said nothing about it being this way...in fact, it was 98% or  more good.  I do not call this good.  I have bought many used tapes with less percent of good to them, and they were better than this one.  Sorry!",1360972800,,552,3.831858407079646
970227,3,6305112924,"I originally bought Savannah Smiles when the orange cover was released.  It was a much better quality than this version of the movie.  The movie itself gets 4 1/2 to 5 stars, But this version of the movie was in a horrible full frame low res quality copy.  My VHS version which I bought at Sam Goody in the 1990's looked better of the movie before I sold it in a yard sale.  This does not reflect on movie mars at all.  They were quite courteous and offered my money back.  But I wanted my family to enjoy the movie.  It is cheesy flicks that poorly released it not Movie Mars.  It has an FBI warning, so it is legit.  But look for the orange case Savannah Smiles if you want the better Wide Screen Quality of the aspect ratio of 1.851.  The VHS was full screen and looked better than the cheesy flicks edition.

The movie is about a politician who cares more about his work than his family, and he needed his wife to make his image look good, to look like a family man.  Savannah has been neglected, and ran away in the park in two criminals car.  The writer of the movie, Mark miller also plays the main star criminal Alvie.  Donnovan Scott Plays Boots.  And Pat Morita is a father of the Catholic Faith.  Good cast, very heart warming.  The criminals want to give her back, she ended up in their car, and one line from the movie when Alvie chucks the ice cream cone out the window hitting the cop on a motorcycle.  When the cop said hello honey to Savannah hiding out in the back seat.  The two criminals asked him who he was referring to.  And he said he was saying hi to their kid.  They made up a story, and the cop was called to another more serious crime.  And Boots said, ""Alvie, we have a kid in the back seat."" To which Alvie said, ""yeah, one that will get us 25 years or more in the federal pen.""If I am not mistaken it has the white haired guy from Airplane, not Leslie Nielson.  Sad fact: Bridgette Anderson as Savannah died in her early 20's, very tragic.  She was another Dakota Fanning.  But in earlier years.  I recommend this movie to the whole family.",1360540800,,2071,4.206106870229007

970610,5,6305112924,"I thought i had rented this years ago from the local video store, but i guess not as i did not remember it after seeing it. It is so nice to own, tho. Bridgette Andersen is just a little doll. The cover i own has a stylized orange early 80's logo with a cut-out of Savannah behind it, i'm glad i bought it when i did as this cover is not currently available. There appear to be about 4 covers to choose from.

Savannah's snooty and image-obsessed parents (well, actually her dad) are absorbed in political affairs to the point of near neglect so she decides to run away. She leaves a hand written note (which we see not fully completed, and thus do not see her reason written for running away) on her parents' nightstand, but it blows under the bed and is not discovered til much later. Savannah is suppose to be spending the night with her cousins at her aunt's house. Her aunt takes the kids to the park, where Savannah, with her already packed suitcase, makes her getaway. Two petty criminals, lovable but bumbling Bootsie and his more hardened partner, Alvie, are at the park in a stolen station wagon into which Savannah slips. When discovered, Alvie & Bootsie are worried about unintentionally being framed for kidnapping charges and return Savannah to the playground, but she runs after the station wagon. One adventure and mishap after another happens, as the pair decide what to do with the little girl who is slowly softening Alvie's hardened heart and had already captured Bootsie's. Alvie reflects on his days during the depression as a country boy feeling left out, and the unlikely pair of a little girl and hardened man find something in common. Kids will especially enjoy the silly antics of Alvie & Bootsie as they try to rob a local drugstore, but adults will find this to be far fetched.

At Savannah's missing, a large scale search ensues with dad's political connections. Savannah's letter is found by the housekeeper, but dad burns it in the fireplace, fearing for his precious image and realizing that since it has been discovered she is a runaway, it was not a kidnapping as thought.

The movie features charming scenery and storyline and the talents of country music writer Ken Sutherland. This is a B-ish movie with a bit of language and grittiness, but more depth than you might think for its kind. I would give it a PG rating. It's a unique movie and hard to describe. Points and emotions of the storyline are well developed, and while Savannah and family are reunited at the end, the ending is kind of unclear. Disgusted by her husband's self absorption, Savannah's mom makes it sound like she is leaving him for good, or is it just on the way home? Somehow tho, that adds to the plot rather than detracting from it. The emotional development of the relationship between Alvie, Bootise and Savannah becomes so focused on that the role of Savannah's parents almost becomes a side story. The trio are seen having a picnic, flying a kite, getting icecream, and setting up house together. With the somewhat rural setting and the real life and fictional references, the movie appears to take place in Kentucky (as Bootsy's last name in the movie is McGaffee, the name McGaffee being prevalent in Kentucky in real life), but it it is later revealed to take place in Utah. Pat Morita (waiter Arnold from Happy Days) even shows up in the antics & search as a Catholic priest.

Bridgette Andersen was such a precocious and talented little doll; it was so sad to hear about her life being so troubled, spookily enough mirroring the life of Savannah herself.",1302825600,,3576,4.662440570522979

970704,4,6305112924,"This was not a high-dollar production with big stars, but look at the huge number of positive reviews posted here. Mark Miller, producer, writer and actor, somehow found a way to touch the emotions of the audience. A couple of bumbling minor-league non-violent felons end up in possession of a runaway daughter belonging to a high-profile Utah political power couple. They first want the reward, but since they did not actually stage a kidnapping, they don't want to risk the rap. On the other hand, they are buying the kid food and baby-sitting and cleaning their hideout for her, so they feel they are owed something. During the course of the movie, the irresistable child, supposed to be age six but portrayed by a charmer who was slightly older, changes the men for the better. Her absence changes at least her mother for the better as well. There are a number of big laughs here, a greater number of chuckles, and a few moments for happy tears. I have to highly recommend it. In real life, lead actor Miller went on to marry the woman who played Savannah's mom, while his sidekick got featured roles in the ""Police Academy"" films. The lovely girl who starred, however, met a tragic end after a short unhappy life. (DO NOT TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT HER FATE UNTIL THEY ARE TOO OLD TO WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE ANYMORE.

Upfront, ""Savannah Smiles"" is a classic.  It relies on a simple, humane story and gives a profound message emphasizing the need for compassion and love in life.

Starring Bridgette Andersen, Mark Miller and Donovan Scott, it tells the story of a young runaway girl named Savannah Driscoll who unknowingly hides in the backseat of the stolen car of two escaped convicts.  Alvie and Boots are very solidly played by Mark Miller and Donovan Scott as opposite sides of the same coin, with Miller's Alvie being the more hardened of the two.  There is an entire family backstory for Alvie that heightens the realistic tone of the storytelling.

Also starring Barbara Stanger and Chris Robinson as Savannah's politically connected parents, and featuring Pat Morita and Peter Graves, ""Savannah Smiles"" is excellent.",1274227200,,824,5.204545454545454

Savannah Smiles is one of my favorite movies. The scene where Savannah tells the story of Brer Rabbit to Bootsie and Alvie is one of the sweetest scenes ever caught on tape.

971022,5,6305112924,"I looked for this movie on DVD for ages. It was even hard to find on VHS. We had nearly worn out our 1980s video recording from cable.
When I had first read about the movie, I thought it would be a ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" sort of tale, but this was not the case.
""Savannah Smiles"" is an odd little story, and I hope it has never inspired a child to run away in order to punish a neglectful parent. Not every person who would find such a child would turn out to be as kind-hearted as Boots (Donovan) and Alvie (Miller). These two convicts (ex-con, in Boots' case) have led hard lives with a great deal of neglect and abuse, themselves. Yet getting to know Savannah (Andersen) and protecting her from the bad things of the world allows them both to learn they can be and are more than they ever thought possible. They tell Savannah that when she ran away, she did something very reckless and dangerous, and that not everyone out in the world would be nice to her. Her safety becomes very important to them.
We can't say as much for Savannah's father, a PR-hungry politician with no heart. (Ironically, he is portrayed by Chris Robinson, whom viewers might remember as Laura's beloved step-dad on General Hospital.)
I loved watching this movie with my kids. They are all grown now, but this movie still holds a special place in all our hearts.
Mark Miller seemed familiar to me. Besides being the actor who portrayed tough-guy Alvie, he was the man who wrote the story and the screenplay. He had also played the part of the dad on a 1960s TV show called ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies,"" which I adored as a kid. One of his real-life daughters is named Savannah.
Sadly, the story of Bridgette Andersen does not have a happy ending. She died from a drug overdose before her twenty-second birthday. What a waste of human life and talent!

You can't help but feel sympathy for Alvie(Miller) and Bootsie (Donovan) from the beginning of the movie.  And Savannah (Bridget Anderson) is captivating.  It is discernible from the beginning of the movie that all three characters have emotional needs.  Alvie wants someone to love him, Savannah needs attention, and Bootsie just wants to take care of someone.  When chance and circumstances put these three together, they become a perfect fit.  Savannah's parents are pretty much occcupied, however, you do see glimpses that mom is at least sublimnally aware of her shortcomings - dad is just an egotistical jerk. Peter Graves character is the epitome of ""stupid"", but it fits with the comedic timbre of the film.

The ending is a little somber and sad, but it is well fit into the overall flow of the movie.  Maybe not an oscar winner, but definitely a movie that deserves to be seen.

Bridgette ""Savannah"" was shown more love and respect with the bad guys then with or by her own parents.  To bad that Savannah never got to see her new friends ever again.

You can tell she loved them when she was taken away in a car with her mom.  Loved her telling them a bed time story, since neither of them new any. She was better off with the 2 guys than at home. I don't normally say that, but in this case I do.

Money can't buy you love and respect.  You have to earn it. Savannah had everything that money could buy her, but all she wanted was the love, respect and time of her parents.

Time spent with a child is worth more than any material thing you can or may buy them.

The police always jump to conclusions.....and the father was horrible to Savannah.  Her nanny found her run away letter, but her own father burned it in the fireplace.

Her father called police even when he promised not to.

Great movie, but very poor quality!  Bridgette, ""Savannah"" made the movie for me.  You can't help falling for this little adorable little girl.  So Cute.

It's about a little rich girl who's father is running for a big position in society, and has really no time for family. He is also a very self centered man. Anyway, to make a long story short, Savannah runs away while playing at the park with her Aunt. She jumps into a car that's parked in the lot, but little does she know they are recently escaped cons. The movie is about these two men that discover Savannah in their car, and then when they find out she's rich, they decide that they want the reward money. Savannah has a wonderful time with these cons (everything we tell our kids not to do with strangers), and I won't tell you anymore, so if you want the movie you'll have to buy it yourself. It is a kid friendly movie, that has a good, tear jerking ending, kind of cheesy, but still it's a sweet movie. My kids watch it over and over.",1167955200,5,1018,4.1206030150753765

There is very little foul language in it, so the PG rating is deserved; otherwise this has all the ingredients of a G movie that can keep an audience of all ages interested.
The PFE disc, however, is miserable.  I have seen better quality on Japanese region-free video CD's.  Can you say huge boxy pixels boys and girls?  The graininess of the disc is beyond grainy.  It's like a 4th or 5th generation VHS copy, or like satellite TV in snow or heavy rain.  The sound and washed-out color match the grain.  I strongly recommend a high quality DVD player if you wish to view the PFE disc without video hang-ups.  I tried several players before it actually cooperated with one.
This is a story that a high-dollar studio needs to buy rights to, then remaster in the best format available and ask whatever price they want.  From what I have seen on web auction sites, and what I have seen from PFE, the next authoring studio of Savannah Smiles could easily get their asking price, even if it is slightly beyond reason.",1071446400,25,1163,4.57487922705314

Liberty park (where Savannah hides in the crooks' car) is a familiar landmark - as it was in the movie, tho now much has changed. So the movie has this local appeal for me as well. I have to agree with the point about modern kidnappings changing the way we look at this story: Elizabeth Smart's disappearance and return (ironically in the very same area ""Savannah Smiles"" was filmed) has emphasized how (allegedly) running away can turn out very bad. Children watching this film should never be given the opportunity to consider Savannah's ""solution"" to unhappiness at home as a possibility. But the film is so well done; and the crooks do not get away with anything: there is no uncompromised ""happily ever after"" ending, but rather a mixed (tho good feeling) ending.

Mark Miller really put a lot of thought into the story; my guess is that he wrote it with his own daughter in mind (the one who plays Savannah's cousin Beth) but that she was too old for the part when it came time to make the film. Although the film is 20+ years old, ideas such as doing the right thing should never go out of style.

I had seen it, as a child loved it had to find it as an adult to show to my girls.  I searched far a wide for a copy and I'm pleased to see they've re-released it.  It took me a long time to acquire it but so happy with it.  You can get for 17.99 on Amazon.  I paid close to 40 dollars for it before the re-release and I'd pay that much for a used copy again in a heart beat.  It's just that good.

971583,5,6305112924,"This is an excellent family movie that didn't quite achieve the box-office success that it rightfully deserved.  It did make the rounds on cable TV,  especially on Showtime, where it became somewhat of a cult classic with not  only 5 year olds, but their parents as well.  I was one of those parents.  Although I do not want to encourage my little girl to jump into the back of  a car with two bumbling criminals, I was enchanted by this heart warming  tale.  Who can resist singing along with the lines, ""I was born and  raised in a briar patch! da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da!""  I, for one,  cannot.  Here I am, 15 years later, browsing through the new release DVD's  (I was actually looking for the adult film star Savannah, but don't tell  that to my kids!), and I saw that this film was being re-released!  Sold!  Although my kids are now in their teens, I'm sure that they'll want to show  this to their kids, and their kids' kids.  A movie that transcends  generations!",966470400,20,976,4.53757225433526
