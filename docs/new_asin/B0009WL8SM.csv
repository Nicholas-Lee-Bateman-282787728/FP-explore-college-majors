8247911,1,B0009WL8SM,"I received the DVD and intended to use it to teach my aikido class.  The DVD would not work in either of my 2 DVD players.  I played it in my desktop and laptop computer.  The DVD stuttered and had no sound.  In short, the DVD is completely unusable.  I returned the DVD and am looking for a different one.  IT is a shame, because I saw parts of this same DVD on Youtube and Dr. Ah Loi Lee is fantastic.  I would not waste my money on a DVD that demonstrates technique but the video quality is too poor to see the skills presented.",1306972800,,531,4.0
