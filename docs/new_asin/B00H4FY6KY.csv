8629845,5,B00H4FY6KY,Good stuff.  Amazing Rhythm Aces are standards in R&B/Americana with a hint of Country.  They never really got their due while they were on the circuit.  Well worth listening to.,1416528000,,178,4.866666666666666
8629846,5,B00H4FY6KY,"No its not the powerhouse Americana band of the 70s at the top of their skills, but until they come up with the video that matches ""Full House Aces High"" this will do quite well. Russell and the band still make great music, so every opportunity to hear or see them is a treasure. Small Venue, the video is OK, the sound is fine, and the band still has great licks.

Set List
1. (as always) The End ins Not in Sight
2. The King is in his Castle (from Russell's End is Not in Sight Solo CD)
3. Della's Long Brown Hair
4. Waitin on Sundown
5. The Rock
6. Mignight Communion
7. Ashes of Love
8. Dancing the Night Away
9. Amazing Grace (Use to be her favorite Song)
10. Randolph's General Store
11. Lipstick Traces
12. Fake it til you Make It
13. Out of the Blue
14. One Love
15. Love is on the Way
16. She Don't Know Her One Strength
17. Third Rate Romance

The band lineup is strong...and played together a lot in the last several years:

Fred James - Bass (looking frighteningly like Mitt Romney - Bluesland)
Kelvin Holly - Guitar (Muscle Shoals)
Mike Dillon Currington - (Muscle Shoals) Drums
Billy E and Russell

Well worth the $$ to see these guys rock out one more time.",1404086400,,1172,4.195555555555556
8629847,5,B00H4FY6KY,"Yes, it's not a highly technical DVD production and, yes, the boys are showing their age a bit (aren't we all), but none-the-less it's ""The Amazing Rhythm Aces!"" They sound wonderful, especially Russell Smith. I have all of their work as CDs and still have my original LPs from 30+ years ago. Happy to find this jewel and add it to my collection. It's in one of my DVD players right now.",1403568000,,387,4.388888888888889
8629848,5,B00H4FY6KY,"The Amazing Rhythm Aces are a huge secret which their hard-core fans share... They should have been huge... but perhaps if they had been, they wouldn't have retained the simple purity of heart and soul they consistently bring. In addition to this first DVD offering, recorded in Australia in 2011, their first two LPs from way back in the 70's, ""Stacked Deck"" and ""Too Stuffed to Jump"" have just been re-released, remastered from the original analog tapes, on a single CD. Both the DVD and the CD are well done and well worth having, either for the curious newbie or for the old fan. Like everything the Aces have ever released, the recording/mixing sound quality is excellent. The DVD was recorded in a small club with less than optimal lighting, so the video does not have the super sharp, brilliant HD showbiz look we are getting used to. But it is well done and it provides an opportunity to get a satisfying look at the Aces in action, recorded Aces style: simple and clean. The songs are a good mix of original songs from their catalog, with a couple of covers, ""Ashes of Love"" and ""Lipstick Traces"". It was delightful to see them playing again on this DVD. I hope they release more concert DVDs... The Aces make life better.",1387324800,5,1231,4.6
