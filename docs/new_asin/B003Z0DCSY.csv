8409879,2,B003Z0DCSY,"One of the key elements of any movie is pacing. Setting a scene is vital, but if you go into too much detail, or take too long to make your point, the audience begins to look elsewhere (their phones, the reflected light off of their watches, the lobby). Pacing is absolutely vital in horror. Yes, you want the audience to identify with your protagonists (and even your antagonists), but if you take too long to get to the titular mayhem, you might well have lost your viewers.
After watching this movie, I was left with two thoughts: (1) Man, it took forever to get to the vampire stuff, and (2) Hmm .. maybe this is like a prologue or something. In either event, a little tightening of the scenes would have helped. When it takes almost 90% of your film to get to the subject matter, that is not good.
The acting was good, as was the camera work. The dialogue in some scenes was a little amateurish to me (and the delivery matched this). Overall, not horrible, but if it is indeed the prologue, let's work on that pacing. The audience deserves better.",1452988800,,1052,4.427835051546392

8409883,5,B003Z0DCSY,"""Serena, A Vampire's Tale"" is an independent horror flick about a sad widow surrounded by people with questionable motives who (you guessed it) gets turned into a vampire and eats folks.  There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make a lot of sense but like I said, this is an independent film and those minor transgressions really don't hurt the film as a whole.  Besides, if you want perfection, rent Weekend at Bernies 2.  I don't see you making your own movie you judgemental cretin.

I know the star of this film (it's my review, I'll toot my horn if I wanna).  So while my review is almost certainly biased, I'll try my best to be objective.

Here's four things I need to see in a horror movie to feel like my time wasn't wasted:
1.  Blood
2.  Bomchicka Wowow
3.  Rahrr!
4.  WTF?

Unfortunately in ""Serena, A Vampire's Tale"" you can immediately scratch off number one.  Granted there's a little blood in one attack scene... but for the most part, this is a movie about some of the most hygienic vampires ever.  I excuse this lack of plasma because my mother taught me how to eat without making a mess when I was a child, and I just assume most vampires have figured out how to eat neatly.  And let's face it, most independent horror films just flood the set with gallons of irritatingly fake blood designed only to red-wash a script void of plot.  That's not the case here.

Ok, number two is difficult for me because I'm essentially an educated man-child incapable of commenting on the sex appeal of a friend without blushing.  So we'll just put a check next to the leading lady and move on.  Thanks for the shower scenes by the way.

It goes without saying that ""Cookie"" was definitely a sexy supporting character and while it was a shame to see her die, audiences will be waiting patiently for her vampyric return as a much more confident and forceful bi-curious vampire.

And man-child as I may be, I am definitely comfortable enough with my sexuality to say the male vampire was indeed an evil force of masculinity to be oggled.  But that's kinda the point, ain't it?  The male vampire is supposed to be seductive.  Serena wasn't just a victim, she was a nearly a willing sacrifice.  Having him double as a street musician was brilliant.  Chicks definitely dig a sensitive, good looking guy who can play an instrument.  A close second would be a big dude who does construction at a cemetery (hilarious character by the way).

Number three is pretty important.  I need to feel like there's something actually horrifying about a horror movie if I'm going to like it.  Where to begin...  As a former mental health patient I find it disturbing, offensive and all together irresponsible to portray a mental health professional as some sort of sick, deluded, murderous villain.  And since this is a horror movie, I say ""Bravo!""  This was Rahrr-tastic because it sets up Serena's vulnerability early on and blah blah blah HOLY CRAP THERE'S A CHICK TIED UP IN THE BASEMENT!  This random subplot wasn't nearly as fleshed out as it could have been and I definitely found myself more interested in the nutty psycho-psychologist than I was in Pierre... the French/Italian-Opera-singer-with-the-unrelated-accent-working-in-the-Mexican-named-""classy""-Restaurant-who-despite-being-a-vampire, still-needed-to-hold-down-a-job.  This really falls more into my ""WTF?"" category but it had to be said.

One of the scarier scenes was the vampire stalking the streets to a metal song looking for somebody to eat.  This scene was definitely worth its weight in awesome.  Now, I used to drink a lot.  Seriously, a lot.  And no matter how drunk I would get, no matter how belligerent I became, I'm confident that if I saw this guy walking towards me, I'd cross the street.  To be fair, I'd have crossed the street after the freaky kids in the mask harassed me from their vehicle.  I'd have crossed the street when I saw the victim carrying his guitar.  I probably would have stayed home that night.  Anyway, this scene was definitely about a big dude getting his bloody neck handed to him by a smaller (albeit way more evil) dude.  I thought of everyone who ever bullied me as a child (adult) and I applauded.  ...thinks he's so special with his facial hair and muscles... pfft enjoy death, indy-rock guy.

Moving on to number four.  Seriously, wtf?  What was the deal with Serena's dead husband?  That poor dead barely mentioned bastard, what's his story?  Who killed him?  This isn't a complaint.  I think there could have been a little more info on him, but to be honest, what do you really need to know about a dead guy?  He's dead, his wife is screwed up, and now she's vulnerable to vampire stuff as a result.  Cool plot device folks.  Cool plot device.

But since you used the same actor to portray the vampire and the husband (with a pretty classy nod to Superman/Clark Kent with the husband in glasses) I'd like to theorize that the dead husband was killed by another vampire (any vampire but Pierre) and turned into the vampire from the film.  My only problem with that theory is that Serena doesn't seem as stupid as Lois Lane and may have figured that out.

And again I wonder, who was the gagged chick in the therapist's basement?  How did she get there?  Was her husband murdered in a tub too?  Where did she go to the bathroom down there?  I bet that house smells.  How many people has the therapist killed?  What is she ""studying"" with these people?  So many unanswered questions.  Right up until the end I was really concerned... Right up until Serena just sort of resolved that issue for me by totally offing the bitch and silently declaring, ""Yeah, I'll go ahead and take the bad guy role, thanks.  Vampire and all that..."" Good recovery.

In short:  Buy this movie.  Fun for the whole dysfunctional family. Plus there's random musical breaks for your enjoyment too!  R.I.P.  Jake, you sad little appetizer.",1301961600,2,5906,4.714985308521058
