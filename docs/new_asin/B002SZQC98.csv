8379735,5,B002SZQC98,"This is a good collection for the price, all the stories included contain some Greek mythology elements.
It is a PAL format Region 2 release, Mono Audio, English subtitles, Audio Navigation and DVD 9 dual layer.
Three discs in individual standard size cases, boxed.
Released 2010.

Disc 1, The Time Monster (1972), features Jon Pertwee (1919-1996) as the third Doctor and Katy Manning as Jo Grant, his  companion as they battle their nemesis The Master.
This is an ambitious and fairly sophisticated story with decent production values, except for the time monster itself.
A person in a white bird suit & helmet just isn't very convincing.
Something  abstract would have been more impressive.
The lovely Ingrid Pitt (1937-2010) gives an interesting performance as the queen of Atlantis.
The documentary extra, Between Now...and Now is a fascinating look at the theories utilized in this story.
All the discs in this release are dual layer but The Time Monster is mastered from a lower quality source and it does show.
Ghosting and instability are obvious unfortunately.
Filmed scenes and all close up shots look very good.
I have the feeling the included extra, Restoration Comparison is something of an apology for the video.

Disc 2, Underworld (1978) features Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor and Louise Jameson as Leela, his companion.
This is a simple and slow paced story, the plot is easily predictable but it does have its own charm.
The extensive use of blue screen special effects for sets and locations was ambitious at the time but still experimental.
The technology had been around for some time prior to this production but few wanted to learn how to master it.
There really wasn't enough time to do that here but some of the scenes look great.
This story could be considered an art project, it is expressive very hands-on work.
The included documentary extra, Into The Unknown is an informative explanation for the blue screen process.
In the extra, In Studio, a time coded video document for this production we learn Tom Baker is a little mischievous and has the censored Potty Mouth.

Disc 3, The Horns Of Nimon (1980), again features Tom Baker as Doctor Who along with Lalla Ward as Romana for companionship.
This story is VERY open to interpretation.
Comedy, satire, drama, absurdity and absurdity.
As I began to watch this it got off to an uncharacteristically bad start.
Cliche after predictable cliche?
Absolute nonsense, offensively so.
I waited for it to get better.
It got worse.
Twaddle.
My mind began to wander....
I noticed the sets. Very nice.
The metal grate floors are horribly noisy.
Great Laser weapon effects.
Costumes are apparently from the House of Klaus Nomi with a 1930s Flash Gordon influence.
It's hard to believe a Tom Baker Who story could be this bad.
Ed Wood would have loved it.
I do like it to a degree, especially the minotaur-like Nimon aliens which are well done overall, but if you want Doctor Who comedy/satire go with The Invisible Enemy. It's a masterpiece.
For everything good I can say about The Horns Of Nimon there is something bad I can think of so it evens out.
Impasse.
Talk about a low point, the previous story to this one was Nightmare Of Eden, another 'worst of' fiasco.
I think it shows what happens when people become apathetic, and this happened towards the end of Graham Williams' and Douglas Adams' tenure.
Disappointing.
Apparently the only person willing to go onscreen for documentary purposes is the writer, Anthony Read.
He pretty much tries to apologize for about 6 minutes.
Poor guy, he seems a decent sort.

Myths And Legends is a very interesting collection overall.

A classic, a rarity and an oddity.

A happy purchase.
