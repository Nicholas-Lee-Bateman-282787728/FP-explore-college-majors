You have to kinda cut first- time filmakers some slack; they learn and get better as time goes on, trial and error. The acting wasn't bad, the overall story was good. The cinemetography is where things go bad, but, you gotta start somewhere. It'll be interesting to see what the director's next project will be.",1306454400,,414,4.684931506849315
7934271,1,B000059TP5,"I bought this movie believing that it had some potential, but unfortunately, it didn't.  It was awful.  I felt as though I were watching a bootleg tape.  Please don't waste your time on this one.",1010620800,,195,4.514285714285714
7934272,1,B000059TP5,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I could have done better with my home video camera.  The script is bad and the acting is even worse. These people need to take acting classes, and if they have they need a refund. I expected more of Todd Bridges and Faizon Love. Save your time and money. This movie is TERRIBLE.",1010534400,,327,4.109375
7934273,1,B000059TP5,"There's a serial killer on the lose in Dallas and Todd Bridges and Faizon Love are the detectives who have to find him.  You will never forgive yourself.  This movie has a poor script, a poor director, and poor actors.  If it was not for faizon Love the movie would be a complete waste, but his presence is only worth so much this time.  This film appears to me be homemade.  It was probably a schol project that some kids dad accidentally took to work a put in the production pile.  But be that as it may save your time dogs know more about police work than Todd Bridges and these actors need more practice.  The plot isn't bad but they blew it.  You know it is pathetic when the person playing the judge can't even say the courtrrom terms properly.",992304000,,750,4.2695035460992905
