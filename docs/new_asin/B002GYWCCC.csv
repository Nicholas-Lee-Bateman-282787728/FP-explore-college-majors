8370093,5,B002GYWCCC,"An great movie I would recommend it to all. There is no distinct groups that should or should not see this movie, it's a movie for everyone.",1400889600,,140,4.222222222222222
8370094,5,B002GYWCCC,"I first saw this show when it first aired years ago on A&E, and used to have it on tape.  Now that I have a DVD player, I wanted to buy the DVD.  It has a lot of interesting information about horses, and covers a wide range of topics.  My 6-year-old daughter enjoyed watching it (and she doesn't normally like anything other than cartoons), and my co-worker's 9-year-old daughter also enjoyed it (she's nuts about horses and horseback riding).  Definitely recommended if you love horses.",1400371200,,487,4.694117647058824

  This documentary showed various breeds of horses like the Icelandic horse and it's unique running walk called the tolt.  The Nez Perce's appaloosa and how their beloved horses were taken away by the US government.  They are now redeveloping their appaloosas into a new & unique breed.  The thoroughbred & horse racing, an American multi-million dollar industry.  The quarter horse and it's amazing ability to understand cow-sense.  The draft horse, in particular, the Suffolk Punch is a healthier way of selective logging for the land.  Our wild horses, the mustang and how Nevada's Storey County banded together to find the killers of their beloved herd of wild horses.

  The program also explored the medical development in the equine field, where medical advancements in the field has enabled many horse athletes to regain their health and performance.

 Horse breaking using the gentler method called ""starting"" by Monty Roberts revealed his language of Equus which enable a 2 year colt to accept the saddle and bridle in as little as 30 minutes!
 Horse training, rather dancing and playing with the horse was demonstrated by Pat Parelli where horses and their owners were shown how to communicate without the use of the bridle & saddle.

The training of California's police horses in preparation for a Halloween celebration revealed training using various crowd distractions before the actual day.  How these horses are so essential in crowd control as well as public relations.

I learned so much from this documentary!",1260057600,6,1666,5.103703703703704
