8429473,5,B004HE17D4,"Just a review of the show.

Full disclosure, I'm a fantasy/sci-fi fan.  This is one of the best examples of the genre I've found.  The writing and storytelling are excellent.  The casting is strange and superb.  Kase Ryo and Toda Erika have amazing chemistry.  I can't say enough how much I love this show and wish it were easier to find a well-translated copy of the DVDs.",1396569600,,373,4.492537313432836
