6255506,4,B00IA7O6KK,This faith-based film was very family-friendly. The collection of intertwining stories was thoughtful and uplifting. I also thought that the cinematography was done well.,1402531200,3,170,6.125
6255507,5,B00IA7O6KK,I absolutely loved this movie.  It covered so many layers in relationships and how fear can be transformed by love.  My favorite part was a scene where Tori is dancing with her precious dog!  I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever been in a romantic relationship of any sort.,1400457600,,282,4.490196078431373
6255508,4,B00IA7O6KK,"This movie was very inspiritional and funny. It deals with real life situations and real life responses to those situations. If you are a couple and are going through a storm right now, I recommend watching it!!!!",1400457600,2,213,4.783783783783784
6255519,3,B00IA7O6KK,"I Love the story line, and for an independent film is was great!  I love watching the actors get more comfortable with their roles as the movie progressed",1452470400,,154,4.5

6255521,1,B00IA7O6KK,Poor acting makes a poor movie. Turned it off after 1/2 hour of my life. Waisted,1436745600,2,80,4.0625
6255522,1,B00IA7O6KK,"Did not hold my interest. Characters were not good actors, more on the corney side. Probably has a good message",1433980800,,111,4.6
6255523,1,B00IA7O6KK,"Not realistic, not even true to the Bible!",1430006400,,42,4.375
6255524,1,B00IA7O6KK,Really bad acting.  Really bad script.  Videography is decent.  I could not sit through the entire movie it was so bad.,1427241600,,119,4.571428571428571
6255525,1,B00IA7O6KK,"Sorry, I love Christian themed movies but turned it off after a few minutes because the acting was so stiff and unnatural. The dialogue was painful to listen to!",1424131200,2,161,4.586206896551724
6255526,2,B00IA7O6KK,"Okay - I liked what was said by the characters about being truthful with oneself, being commited to oneself in order to receive commitment in return etc ... But the script was cliche and trite, the lines were spoken almost woodenly, and the acting was without depth.  One way you can tell amateurish acting is when the actor constantly fills and punctuates his/her lines with sighs.  There was quite a bit of sighing in this movie.",1423440000,2,431,4.657894736842105
6255527,1,B00IA7O6KK,"Faith based presentation which would anchor its premise on the acceptance of angels in existence.  For a very low budgeted and weakly staged production, I think this film demands first that one be of a religious mind-set,  accepting of the theory that an all encompassing ""Being"" controls and commands how our living and eventual demise shall play out. In and of itself, that nonsense is not aided by the wooden and stilted performances of a few relatively unknown, therefore untested community theatre hacks, as they attempt to ""help other mortals straighten out their problems"".  Silly and meaningless, there is no social message here, unless you are a member of the club, those who profess to lead and live with godly fervor. For the story to be beyond a few moments duration, this is more or less something that also is absolutely required.  It has been said that religion is the opiate of the masses, but a film which strains the imagination with even less than credible scripting is way too much for this viewer. I had to turn this off because of the stiff acting and annoying dialogue.  I cannot recommend this film simply because of the ridiculous screenplay theory. The soundtrack was good though.  Otherwise, this is a shipwreck just waiting to happen.",1423440000,2,1262,4.873831775700935
6255528,5,B00IA7O6KK,"This is a heartfelt movie about relationships of any kind and it is based on beautiful spiritual elements underlying our lives here on earth. I enjoyed watching it. Especially the part where one of the angels in-training  shares HU, an ancient name for God and a beautiful prayer with the characters.",1404086400,,300,4.882352941176471
8640317,3,B00IA7O6KK,Jack & Tanya have died in a car accident.  They go to heaven and are put in the angel training program.  Specifically they are to help couples find understanding with each other and have a better relationships.  It sort of reminds me of 'Touched by an Angel'.  There are 2 couples in this movie that are helped by the angels in training who in turn learn things about their relationship also.,1483488000,,392,4.47887323943662

8640321,1,B00IA7O6KK,Seriously watered down movie. No spiritual backing. Look elsewhere. How it got a Dove Award for bad acting is beyond me. No originality! I you like touched by an angel perhaps you'd like this one too.,1474588800,,200,4.583333333333333
8640322,5,B00IA7O6KK,It was awesome. I loved it. Thanks for having it available.,1473465600,,59,4.454545454545454

8640326,1,B00IA7O6KK,"This movie does not have objectionable content.
If you don't like it in the first 5 minutes, ditch it.  It doesn't get better.
I'm sure it is well intentioned; it's just bad film making.",1471305600,,186,4.470588235294118
