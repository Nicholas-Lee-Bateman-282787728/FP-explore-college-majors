This was a very beautiful but quite disturbing movie, based on real events which most in Sweden would probably just as soon forget; it was certainly a dark and unedifying aspect of their history. Stuff the Nazis did, but this time coming from a supposedly enlightened government. Set in 1951, it concerns the forced removal from their families of young women - girls from poor backgrounds, or the mentally deficient. At its heart, it was a program to root out the less than perfect elements of society, those elements which tended to ""breed more"" and which would ultimately be a burden on the nation. And Gertrud is taken away to live with the other such girls. The nursing staff are not at all unkind - the matron is wonderfully supportive actually - but they are there to fulfil the government's program and so their hands are pretty much tied. The only ways out are to undergo forced sterilisation, or be proven insane, but then you're taken to a mental institution. Toss the coin, you lose either way. I'm painting a very bleak picture here, and it certainly is, but the acting and casting are magnificent. Gertrud (Julia Hgberg) and the matron (Maria Lundqvist), sublime. There are elements of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and even Napola in some strange way. A sobering movie, but a significant one. And ultimately uplifting too. Stunning cinematography as you might expect, and Gertrud, such beatific innocence.",1362787200,,1518,4.838461538461538
