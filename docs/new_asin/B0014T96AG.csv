8256293,5,B0014T96AG,"Wonderful DVD, my 5 year old loves this DVD and so do I.  As a teacher I also work with handicapped children and the hearing impaired.  There is no language in this DVD it is all a visual story so it is easy for the very young or language impaired to understand.  I highly reccommend for 3-10 year olds or anyone who loves animals.",1269734400,,331,4.140625

8256296,5,B0014T96AG,I watched this on HBO on demand with my daughter. She LOVED it. It is really cute & the music is pleasant. The video has good messages for kids ex: It's what it on the inside that counts & things like that. I hope they make more of these they are just adorable.,1204329600,,261,3.943396226415094
8256297,5,B0014T96AG,"I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old boys based on a raving recommendation from a friend and they LOVE it.  When I pop it in they get mesmerized, you know the big eyes and sightly open mouth look?  What I didn't expect was that Penny, our terrier, loved it too.  She gets separation anxiety when we leave so we have been trying to figure out a solution.  Penny loves watching all the puppies in the show and it definitely calms her down.",1203897600,2,438,4.117647058823529
8256298,5,B0014T96AG,"I was fortunate enough to catch this program on HBO Family recently and my two children, 2 and 5, both LOVED it. Now that we have the DVD it's on non-stop, which is actually fine by me as the score is quite pleasant, and the puppies are simply adorable. What a fabulous way to introduce my children to classical music. We are all eager for the next batch of puppy fun!",1203897600,6,368,4.197183098591549
