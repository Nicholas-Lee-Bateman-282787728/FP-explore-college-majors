8347509,2,B001WB6NBQ,"While most of the territory here has already been covered by biographers, here you'll view some of the countryside and structures that were integral to Carroll's life. Using a pan-and-scan format, you'll see photos both by and of Carroll along with illustrations, artifacts, burial sites, statues, and plaques which commemorate the man and his literary legacy. It's narrated by an elderly British gent whose style of slow, almost lethargic speaking may induce drowsiness in some viewers.

Unfortunately, this documentary fails to capture the magical charm and witty genius that captivated the hearts and minds of his child friends. Instead, it feels like the heavy-handed film you may have had to watch in school. It hardly comes close to inducing any curiosity or satisfying anyone's appetite for Carroll. If you really want to find out more about the fascinating Carroll, seek out Morton Cohen's comprehensive and thrilling biography. If you can't find that, just about any other book on Carroll would be more interesting than this stodgy-dodgy program.",1430179200,,1055,5.317365269461078
8347510,5,B001WB6NBQ,Is a very beautiful and interesting documentary about the fascinating life of Lewis Carroll. It has very interesting images. To Recommend! No doubt!,1364688000,,148,5.478260869565218
8347511,2,B001WB6NBQ,"Drone, drone, buildings, rivers, drone, drone. Too much left out or minimized (e.g., Dodgson's work with math, logic, puzzles). Just the one guy talking. Very few examples shown (no family newsletters, very thin on non-Alice material). His rooms at Oxford not shown. The Alice shop at Oxford not mentioned or shown. Russian trip mentioned, but no views of Russia. There are quotations, but not many and not the best. Dodgson's massive guilt trip glossed over, hypochondria overemphasized. Justification of nude photography undermined by statement that he liked to go to the beach to see scantily clad children (haven't heard this anywhere else). Sorry. I was prepared to like and defend this video, but I just can't.",1313280000,,716,5.181034482758621
8347512,2,B001WB6NBQ,"While there IS quite a bit of info presented in this dvd, most of it is of the mundane variety and, to make matters worse, attempts are made to explain away Charles Dodgson's interest in young girls.  Also, as the other two reviewers have noted, this doc is quite boring (e.g there are no Carroll experts interviewed and only the narrator speaks - or should I say, drones on).

If one is very interested in Dodgson/Lewis Carroll, one wd be better off getting a copy of Morten Cohen's or Karoline Leach's bio of him (I recommend the former: though published 15 years ago, it's still the best and sticks pretty much to the facts, whereas Ms. Leach's book makes some wild speculations that are backed up by specious evidence - there's also a new bio by Jenny Woolf that is to be released in Feb. and has attracted some buzz).

Of course, if one has their heart set on a DVD or video, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-Books-Alice-in-Wonderland-VHS/dp/6304296878/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great Books:Alice in Wonderland [VHS</a>] installment from The Learning Channel's excellent series.  Although it's a bit dated and can only be found on videotape (occasionally, a used copy can be found here on Amazon), it's very informative and entertaining (Cohen appears on it and gives his two cents).  Indeed, becuz it's a videotape (I don't think that TLC put out any of the Great Books episodes on DVD), it can often be had pretty cheap.",1264291200,,1492,5.1234567901234565
8347513,2,B001WB6NBQ,"Sadly, this documentary is a mere slow moving attempt @ using visual fluff to beat around the bush. The viewer follows redundant scenery as the narrator drones on about Carroll's mundane life as a math professor until the film finally reaches its point. The narrator intermittently hints about Carroll's fascination & attachment to a real life friend named, ""Alice."" Alice is a child & Carroll is an adult who often photographs her naked. The disillusioning part is not the length of this boring film, but the fact that the narrator actually has the audacity to frame Carroll's practice in the context of a culturally appropriate pass time for that period in time. It's no wonder Carroll's character, ""Alice"" has to follow a path of confusion. I'm sure that little girl's life felt maddening @ times indeed. Today, Carroll would not be a legend. He would be a registered sex offender.",1262995200,,884,4.9
8347514,4,B001WB6NBQ,"Don't be deceived by the black and white photo on the cover.  This documentary is recently done, in color, and gives a good background on the life of ""Alice in Wonderland"" creator Lewis Carroll.  It runs 75 minutes in length, with no extras.  The program is narrated by one person, which gets a little dull.  Perhaps some interviews with Carroll experts would have helped break up the narration a bit.  On the whole, good, though.",1259884800,2,430,4.68
