5719109,4,B00CENWUWW,"I've seen this guy before on Shark Week and now on BBC , which I believe makes the best nature programming bar none. Unique footage of a GW ambush attack from the seabed to the surface not seen anywhere else.",1398643200,5,208,4.225
5719110,4,B00CENWUWW,Shark Week fans will enjoy this BBC documentary. It is not just another shark attack documentary. This video is intended to educate the viewers about the Great White Shark.,1381190400,8,172,4.9655172413793105
8580968,3,B00CENWUWW,There were a few minutes of extraordinary footage (chiefly the moments in which the photographer captures a great white's movement BELOW the surface before breaching). That might've made it worth the purchase. But I still wouldn't dare say this is the most thrilling piece on Great White Sharks. It's worth adding to a collection. But might not be the first and last film you'd expect to buy ON this subject.,1529280000,,408,4.8428571428571425
8580969,5,B00CENWUWW,"I saw this on TV and it is the best Shark video I have ever seen. I bought it for my Grandchildren who are fascinated with the species, loved it so much I ordered myself one. I highly recommend it to any shark lovers",1504396800,,216,3.9318181818181817

Mike Rutzen of the fishing town Gansbaai dives freely in an unprotected manner in the ocean with great white sharks in scenes that would have been unimaginable in past decades.  He has learned that curling his body into a ball can attract the shark and that stretching his body outward can repel the shark.  There are many excellent scenes of great white sharks swimming with fluid grace under the water.  When Mike and his crew pull a seal model through the ocean, there are tremendous action scenes of great white sharks explosively jumping out of the water to attack the model, some of which show the sharks rotating high in the air nearly 360 degrees before slamming back down into the water, and Mike dives under the water at these times at the end of the documentary to film the sharks' rapid accelerations to the surface.  The documentary also shows great white sharks feeding in a calm social manner on a whale carcass, and I remember reading that great white sharks have never been seen in a feeding frenzy; the sharks eat the whale's energy-rich blubber, which can sustain them for many weeks, and they use their pointed lower teeth to hold the blubber and their upper teeth to saw through it.  Great white sharks can live for 60 years, and they can keep their bodies warmer than the cold Cape Peninsula waters; they also have the most highly-developed sense of smell of any shark.  I appreciated the scenes of Mike on his boat Stan speeding over the water and of the winter winds whipping up the coastal waves.  The documentary also features southern right whales, giant stingrays, and the 60,000 Cape fur seals of Geyser Rock, who are favorite prey items for the great white sharks -- there are scenes of seals jumping out of the water in avoiding the jaws of the attacking sharks.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Great-White-Shark-A-Living-Legend-DVD/dp/B00CENXW8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Great White Shark:A Living Legend(DVD)</a>&nbsp;is a great filming achievement in showing great white sharks in various vigorous situations as well as human bravery and determination in such efforts.",1486771200,2,2426,5.627397260273972
