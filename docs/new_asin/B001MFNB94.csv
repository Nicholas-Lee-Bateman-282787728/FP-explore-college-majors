3697106,3,B001MFNB94,"I have been watching a lot of terrible horror movies lately, so I was hoping for something better here.  The movie is ok.  The budget appears to be larger than the movies I have been renting.

I love Kaley Cuoco from the Big Bang Theory TV show and she doesn't disappoint here.  The setting of North Dakota and the cast were all good.  You won't be disappointed, but it isn't anything special.",1242000000,2,393,4.402777777777778
3697107,3,B001MFNB94,"It looks like other reviewers here are probably involved with the film.  I am not; I just watched it.  This movie is the average slasher fare with a reality show spin on it.  Even though the storyline is not so original, I still found the movie likeable all the way to the end.  It has the cheesiness but doesn't look cheap, some humor, decent kill scenes, and good music scores.  Slasher movie fans would particularly find this film entertaining.",1233878400,39,447,4.6075949367088604
3697108,5,B001MFNB94,"Killer Movie, as the title foreshadows, is an intelligent, witty mix of horror and satire.  It's a movie within a movie, a dark and cuttingly humorous inside take on the world of reality TV, written and directed by Jeff Fisher, an actual reality TV director.  The horror is especially chilling, and the humor rings particularly true, because the reality TV material is based on the director's real life reality TV experience.  Thanks to the wicked, cutting edge, deliciously twisted imagination that inspired the script, you can't predict what's going to happen  -- and that's what makes Killer Movie a truly refreshing departure from all those horror movie cliches that have already been done to death.",1232841600,6,703,5.086956521739131
3697109,5,B001MFNB94,"I saw Killer Movie in a film festival a couple of months ago. It was so funny at times, and really creepy at others. The acting was great, and the characters were so interesting and multifaceted. The dialogue was witty and fresh, and Kaley Cuoco's one-liners had me laughing out loud. But even with all the humor, you never forget that you're watching a horror movie. The gory details are horrifying and the murders creative and original. I won't spoil anything, but it'll leave you thinking, ""I never would have thought to kill someone like that."" You really have to see for yourself. I strongly recommend this movie for any horror or comedy fan.",1229990400,19,647,4.684210526315789
3697110,5,B001MFNB94,"""Killer Movie"" succeeds because of three elements that are sorely missing for the majority of horror films these days: thrills, titillation, and wit. This is a little gem. A long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, the slasher genre was a reliable source of entertainment. Sadly it has devolved into a breeding ground for the most shallow, talentless people in the film industry. It seems there is no room to make a movie that's actually, well, GOOD, just profitable. Every ""creative"" decision is borne from the desire to make money. And of course, throngs of people flock to the theaters and eat it up. Against such a grim backdrop, it is a cause for celebration when a movie like ""Killer Movie"" comes out. Here's a slasher film that adheres to all of the conventions of the genre without pandering to the lowest common denominator. Horror fans will love this, and I predict it will do extremely well commercially. The story is of personal relevance to its director (a former reality TV director), and the results are funny and scary, often at the same time. The director had previously worked on shows like The Simple Life and Real World, and it's easy to see how the experience affected him. I guess the best way to segue from reality TV into the film industry is to make a film about a reality TV show crew being MURDERED. ""Killer Movie"" is impressive and fun.",1229299200,3,1366,4.602459016393443
3697141,5,B001MFNB94,"The main reason I bought this Film was because Kaley Cuoco was in it.  I was in no way disappointed as she has the knack of playing ""Blanca Champion"" (the Big Time Hollywood Celebrity starring in Killer Movie) funny while not being bitchy.......as the main babes in other movies of this type usually always are.  A perfect fit for Her Beautiful Talent at comedy while the film is not intended to be a comedy (at least I thought that was not its intention).  5*s for a different type of slasher movie!",1447891200,5,500,4.472527472527473

3697164,5,B001MFNB94,"Reality TV gone wrong could be a nightmare. This movie is about a possible nightmare from reality TV. Seaton Brookstone, a TV producer in this movie, has seen it all in the way of bad crews, bad actors, and unexpected expenses. Now, this particular cast in this movie finds itself stranded in a small, remote town with a serial killer. Paul Wesley(Vampire Diaries) plays the Director for this Reality TV nightmare that becomes very real for his cast and crew including an actress named Blanca Champion, played by Kaley Cuoco(Charmed, Big Bang Theory).

3697188,5,B001MFNB94,"I saw this movie and did not recognize many of the cast members, but I thought I would try it since it was a thriller. I was happily surprised to find how good it was. While some parts of the movie reveal that it was not made on as high dollar of a budget, the cast works well together, makes the movie interesting and brings the right touch of scare. The story line is one that is similar to many of the other thriller movies, but it has an interesting edge to it through the reality TV angle. As the movie ramps up into the scary parts with the killer, the movie still maintains its story line and develops its characters amongst the insanity which is quite impressive since many of the mainstream thrillers are incapable of doing this on there high dollar budgets. The other thing I liked about this movie is that from scene one, you know that you're watching a thriller and you get a piece of the action which doesn't stop until the resolution of the film. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys thriller movies or just wants a good scare.",1309132800,2,1085,4.349753694581281
3697189,2,B001MFNB94,"This wasn't the worst movie ever made but KILLER MOVIE is far from being any good. First off, the acting was not terrible it was just that the story was weak and they didn't have much to work with. The casting director nailed it with the girls they chose because all of them are hot but how are they going to cast JC Chasez? I tend to stay away from anything Nsync. The production level was okay, not bad editing, lighting was fine, it really was just a weak plot and I never jumped in my seat once. Screw White Plains, North Dakota, I have seen scarier things go down in White Plains, New York on a Tuesday night. It was like they were trying to do too much with this horror movie and the end was anticlimactic as I thought it would be. Jason London, what happened to Randy Pink Floyd and your glory days? Ouch that it has come to this. One more thing, what the hell is the guy from LOST doing in this flick? Isn't he still on the island? Sorry, that was lame but so is this slasher flick.

3697190,4,B001MFNB94,"I really liked this film. Characters you actually hate to see be killed off, really funny dialogue, and a self-awareness that manages to not come across as snide. No one is re-inventing the wheel here, but this is genuinely enjoyable b-movie fun, and not B because of acting or script. B because of budget. My only complaint is who they list as the lead actress, but no spoilers here!",1296432000,,384,4.579710144927536
3697201,4,B001MFNB94,"Although billed as a slasher movie satire I didn't seen any satire while watching it. This aside, it's actually not a bad movie. I enjoyed watching what turned out to be a well-played tale about small-town murder involving the hapless members of a reality TV crew and their accompanying Z-list hopefuls.

Despite the routine scenario and, with one or two exceptions, a cast made up of actors who aren't particularly well-known, they all produced entertaining work from an only average script. Although Leighton Meester has done quite a lot of film work, the best known name in the cast is probably Kaley Cuoco, who maybe took this on as a useful addition to her rsum. What other admirers of Kaley's characters in 8 Simple Rules and The Big Bang Theory make of her portrayal in this movie of an unpleasant, somewhat desperate wannabe, struggling on the fringes of recognition in the acting business, isn't for me to say, but I think she's made a professional job of it. On the strength of this movie I'd like to see what she does with a much bigger budget thriller.

Said maniac is an interesting fellow, w/ his own unique take on reality TV. KM has gallons of blood and several dismemberments, yet manages to remain fun and interesting.

I would recommend it to slasher fans.",1265587200,13,272,4.25
3697207,3,B001MFNB94,"Some stylistic editing, helps distinguish Killer Movie (2008) from most other slasher flicks.  Director/writer Jeff Fisher's film is pretty slick looking affair, that features a number of inserted interview type clips to give the film  a reality TV look, and also helps advance the story.  The presence of sitcom veteran Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory, 8 Simple Rules), adds some spice, and gives the film some balls, as her character, a foul mouthed diva type, is a switch from the 'good girl' roles she is more well known for.

A television crew arrives in White Plains, North Dakota, to shoot a piece about The Goldiggers, the local high school hockey team.  It seems pretty routine, but what producer Lee Tyson (Cyia Batten) instructs director Jake Tanner (Paul Wesley) to try to do, is also dig up some dirt about the death of a local teenage girl, who was mysteriously beheaded while riding on a scooter.  Awaiting the arrival of starlet Blanca Champion (Cuoco), the crew starts shooting interviews at the school.  A masked killer also begins to get very busy, arranging an accident for the cheerleading coach, offing the hockey coach, and then taking a pick to a production assistant.  A few murders don't seem to stir things up very much, and even as the bodies continue to pile up, the townsfolk and even law enforcement, remain completely unconcerned.  The killer is an enormous Blanca Champion fan, and is bent on proving it to her.  Although increasingly shorthanded, the crew pushes on, until there is a final confrontation at the school.

There are some nice gory bits, including a near decapitated head flopping, a body strung up on the wall of the gym, and a hanging via chain scene.  Almost everyone in the crew falls victim to the very active killer.  Much that happens, does not make a lot of sense, as the killer seems to be everywhere, pushing up the body count.

Kaley Cuoco seems to be having a blast playing a vamp, and swearing up a storm.  She is the best thing about this movie, and makes a seamless transition from being frightened, to a clear thinking and rational.  Paul Wesley (The Vampire Diaries) tries to take his role seriously, but it isn't easy, as his character Jake is pretty passive most of  the film, until the end, when he makes an impossible recovery from a serious injury, that should have left him incapable of walking.  Adriana DeMeo (Without a Trace), is funny and quirky, as a member of the crew, and Maitland McConnell (Ninja Cheerleaders) is amusing as an overemotional cheerleader.  The acting is a mixed bag, and no one will be willing any awards, but at least the cast features some attractive actors, and snappy aggressive dialog.

Attempting to live up to its name, Killer Movie does feature a lot of kills, and the level of violence ramps up with each successive kill, peaking in the final twenty minutes.  Not all the kills are graphic or that impressive though.  Suspense and tension could be built up if there were more pursuit, or interaction between the killer and his victims, instead of quick strike kills.  The killer may be a surprise, although the reason for the murderous spree is rather tenuous.

Killer Movie does not offer much that is really original, but if you have a fondness for slashers, and like a lot of victims, you may want to take a look.  The film is definitely recommended to Kaley Cuoco fans, as she is having fun with her role.  She does not appear until after the 31 minute mark, but that is when things really get started.  The feature is subtitled in Spanish only, contains the trailer, a photo gallery, a short behind the scenes featurette, and a digital copy of the movie in Windows and Mac formats.",1262908800,5,3691,4.7087227414330215

This is a movie within a movie so thats pretty different than most movies today. There is some gore in the movie but it's not overly done which I like. There are also some funny parts in the movie so you get horror and comedy in the same movie.

3697210,4,B001MFNB94,"A slasher movie called ""Killer Movie""? I did not expect
this to be good, and it wasn't - it was freaking great.
Killer Movie is a movie that will be loved by some and
hated by many because this is extremely unoriginal and
not everyone will get the humour in it but this hit home
for me. Just like ""Scream Bloody Murder"", Killer Movie
knows how to make me smile while still delivering all
the kills that one could want from a slasher flick. It's
gory, funny and even made me jump a couple of times.
Heck, I even enjoyed this more than My Bloody Valentine.
Killer Movie isn't constantly over the top so when the
gory scenes come, they're so unexpected that you can't
help but to cheer a little inside your head. This is
a slasher fan's dream.

Unlike many other reality-TV oriented slasher flicks,
Killer Movie doesn't really act like a reality-TV show,
it's just about a bunch of people shooting a reality-TV
show. This means that the movie doesn't look like it
was shot with a camcorder. In fact, the movie looks good
enough to be a theatrical horror flick. Anyway so these
people are shooting a reality-TV show in a small town,
unknowing of the fact that a masked serial killer is
on the prowl, following their every move. The movie starts
out quite slow so you don't really know what to expect
at first. We get to know all of the characters quite
thoroughly and the movie doesn't give away whether it's
a comedy or a horror flick at once. The jokes are all
very subtle which is why some people won't get it but
I just loved the sarcastic tone of it all. Then when
the horror hits, it hits hard and it increases by every
kill until it's finally a complete bloodbath.

Killer Movie is indeed an outrageously entertaining
slasher flick which pokes fun at the slasher genre while
still managing to stay humble and honour slasher fans
all over the world. Yes, I think all slasher fans out
there will agree with me on the fact that this is just
a brilliant horror flick. However, for those of you with
a more... complex mind, if you will, this may seem
generic and flat. I'm sure many of you will be outraged
by my extremely positive review but I have got to be
honest and I freaking loved every second of this slasher
film and I know that some of you out there will be able
to see the genius of it as well. If you're in the mood
for a good and fast-paced slasher flick, do not miss
out on Killer Movie. It's an awesome ride.",1251331200,2,2421,4.318681318681318
