8179054,5,B000NK6S2Q,"I bought the Valley of Light as a birthday present for my Mother and we found it to be quite pleasing.  It takes place in the 1940s in the rural South and has very  much the feel of a good novel.  It is very much a Hallmark movie as it is not an action based plot, but rather one with a more human experience emphasis.  It centers around how one soldier coming back from WWII, struggles to overcome his grief, and encounters great kindness from good-hearted people in a small town that he happens upon.  It is definitely pleasing and I do recommend it very much.",1200700800,,562,4.264150943396227
