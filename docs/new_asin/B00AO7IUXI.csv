My daughter's 4 floor walk up in Spanish Harlem had tent raised to $1400/mo. It's small enough to fit in my kitchen. But, the neighborhood is lovely and cohesive. People know & help each other. Now, gentrification is ruining it !",1409788800,4,264,4.520833333333333
5462930,4,B00AO7IUXI,This documentary goes a little deeper. It showed more of the economic and political history of the urban renewal trend. It really made me question my tendency to go after the next boom or trend instead of value my heritage and traditions.,1409616000,6,238,4.690476190476191

5462933,4,B00AO7IUXI,"Watching The Vanishing City, I have 2 opinions that seem to counter act each other. On the one hand I am against the use or even abuse of Eminent Domain. I don't feel that someone over the age of 50 should have to lose their home without help finding a new place. If the landlord wants to sell of if a buyer wants to buy, the people whose lives will be effected should be considered in the process. On the other hand is a feeling that these areas have been growth-less for the reasons that are pretty obvious for all to see. People living in poverty, or close to the poverty line, crime, drugs and just a general uncleanliness which points to a lack of genuine appreciation for their neighborhoods and community, should this impecuniousness destitution be allowed to continue after 30 years, how about 40 or 50 years?",1408320000,,817,4.489932885906041
5462934,5,B00AO7IUXI,"My name is Anita & as a previous NYC citizen for 7 years, the movie made me ask what the Frick happened? I love the beautiful city  and it should stay the multicultural melting pot that it was always known for. People flock here all the time to live out their dreams. Immigrants  MADE this city from  scratch and the ground up! They cannot toss them out like yesterday's garbage without the respect they need to be given after working so damn hard all these years. See this movie! It will open your eyes to what this beautifully diverse city has turned into. HELP!",1407974400,,564,4.403846153846154
5462935,4,B00AO7IUXI,This is a very well done documentary on the gentrification of New York and the resulting loss of the character and charm of various neighborhoods. It is another dismaying example of unregulated capitalism at its worst.,1407888000,9,218,5.083333333333333

5462937,5,B00AO7IUXI,"The Vanishing City (2010) is an hour-long documentary film, directed by Jen Senko and Fiore DeRosa, that hasn't yet received a commercial release. But it has been shown at many film festivals, and screened before innumerable church and community organizations.  The film explores how the city's housing policies have been skewed under our billionaire Mayor towards pro-development and the affluent (that famous 1%) by massive re-zonings, and anti-community initiatives. It's a housing policy that makes it harder and harder for the working and middle class to find decent, affordable places to live in the city, and immigrants to find jobs. Vanishing City is a powerful call to arms against those moneyed interests who want to destroy the fabric of the city, who want to turn it into a sea of luxury towers.
Watching it would stir the viewer to join one of the many community organizations to fight off those who want to destroy all that is left of a diverse and egaliatarian New York.",1356307200,4,985,4.96969696969697
5462956,3,B00AO7IUXI,"Interesting enough, but it concentrates on just one city - New York City - without really pulling examples from other cities.

Sadly, all our culturally diverse sections are being gobbled up for bull dozing to make room for 3 to 10k a month apartments, condos, and mansions. What about our Thai Town? China Town? Little Tokyo? Koreatown? Little Italy? The steel processing farm plant in the Bronx? So many good people and jobs are being chased out of their own communities. They been there for decades! And now watch and learn.",1429315200,5,506,4.633333333333334
5462959,2,B00AO7IUXI,"It seems to be a fine documentary,however it focuses solely on New York City. That is fine, but I was hoping for a broader picture.",1428019200,,131,4.28
5462960,5,B00AO7IUXI,"The posters who downrate this film argue that change happens, change is natural, change is inevitable, change is necessary. The point of this film is that many of the changes happening in NYC are not natural but are the result of deliberate governmental policies. Those policies were not inevitable and perhaps were short-sighted and ill-advised. From what I remember of NYC, where I grew up and practiced law for some years, they may also involve corruption. They certainly have resulted in a great deal of suffering. One does not have to be a flaming liberal to feel the pain of an old man forced to leave the apartment he has lived in for decades and find a new place to live. Cant empathizing with his plight be considered compassionate conservatism? One also does not have to be blind to the inevitability of some change to conclude from the evidence presented that there can be too much change, too fast change, bad change.

This is not, by the way, a phenomenon limited to NYC  Chinese money pouring into Seattle has put that city beyond the reach of many people who long called the area home  nor to the US. Foreign money flooding into London has put housing beyond the reach of many English people who have lived in London all their lives, like their parents and grandparents before them  a flat I rented in London years ago for 100/month now costs 200/day. The artists who used to flock to Paris and created an artistic nirvana there can no longer afford to live there  no chance for Puccinis Bohemians to rent a garret there today. The same fate befell the artists who gave Greenwich Village and Soho their personalities; and Berlin, which was affordable for some years after reunification, is moving in the same direction.

Can this juggernaut be stopped? Pushed back? Reversed? Those are the questions raised by this film, which does not endeavor to answer them because that requires a different skill set than its makers possess. A very valuable film, I think; now I wish people with the skills to find answers would make the necessary sequel. Or perhaps there are no answers and all the great cities of the world will soon be populated by the very rich and their chauffeurs, butlers, and a stable of retained lawyers and doctors who are allowed inside their employers apartments, but only via the tradesmens entrance. That may well happen, but I hope it is not inevitable, it isn't necessary, and it certainly isn't desirable.",1426204800,7,2441,4.745283018867925
5462961,4,B00AO7IUXI,"The politics of coming out of exile is in its last phase. We have ended segregation but in housing there are still neighborhoods that cling to this old obsolete standard. They want to live with ""their own kind"" and that in it self is a statement of hate and mistrust of the rest of the world. Breaking up these isolated ethnic areas is going to help end the politics of race. When integration into a mainstream society happens for these people they will not be able to cling to the old standards that "" white people"" are to blame for all their ills. It is not ""white"" people who have done anything. It is individuals who have abused others. When they claim whites are to blame- they collectively condemn all the good people who have helped them in thier emancipation. When these areas are transformed by mixing economic levels we will start to see the identity of ethnicity emerge as ""American"" first and not prefixed with ethnicity first. We are so divided with hate that to begin to see ourselves as Americans first is a step towards unity and peace in this society. This film is a lesson about learning to live with each other. The Post Katrina documentaries on Louisiana also demonstrate the changes coming for large city policy development.",1423094400,,1245,4.638009049773756
5462962,5,B00AO7IUXI,"I live in the city and see this going on every day.  All of us long-time residents talk about how horribly crushingly intense the development and gentrification is.  It's undeniable.  So many beloved institutions lost for a developer's profit.  This documentary gives an outsider a good look at what's going on.  Those cities who haven't yet caught the eye of the developers should take note and get ready to fight back from the first sign of their arrival. To all of us in NYC and other cities who have been under constant developer onslaught for awhile now, get involved and get others involved.",1419811200,9,597,4.757281553398058

5462964,5,B00AO7IUXI,"I really enjoyed watching The Vanishing City.  As a New Yorker who lives in Brooklyn in a neighborhood that has been going through rapid gentrification, this documentary puts it in perspective for me.  I live in an area in Brooklyn where the residents who have lived there most of their life can no longer afford to keep living there.  I am one of those residents.  I grew up in the area and have lived there for over 30 years. All of a sudden these outsiders with lots of money are moving in and the landscape has changed. Where there was affordable housing, now there's $1+ million dollar town homes and condos.  The Vanishing City provides people like me, who are experiencing the vanishing of their neighborhood an understanding of why it's happening.  Great documentary and well-worth watching by urban dwellers like me.",1417305600,10,825,4.774647887323944
5462965,1,B00AO7IUXI,"This is a very poorly-orchestrated documentary. I would imagine that most people watch documentaries for the same reason I do - to be informed - and this documentary does precious little of that.

The ideological bias and economic ignorance of the creators of this documentary are glaring from the start and take such a domineering role in the film as it progresses that I was stunned to have something that could have been genuinely informative and have led to a coalition-building message that might have some appeal outside the flock (eminent domain abuse under the Kelo v. City of New London decision) sidelined in favor of dogmatic preaching to the indoctrinated.

The eminent domain issue was addressed so sparingly and deferred until so far into the film that it appears almost deliberately calculated to obfuscate the extent to which the crusade that the filmmakers clearly sought to call is one demanded by the abuse of eminent domain as opposed to simple self-interested frustration of those whose use of property they do not own is demonstrably less valuable than those that the actual owners of the property wish to transition to. Whatever the facts are, this suggests to any viewer who is not already inclined to buy the story that the filmmakers wish to sell (and the political agenda along with it) that the substance behind the story is lacking.

One can readily come to one of two possible conclusions: (1) that a flimsy and purely dogmatic agenda has been coated in the veneer of a respectable argument (the eminent domain issue) for the sake of persuading the less attentive of the uninitiated to support the message or (2) that the filmmakers, in their ineptitude at their craft and/or eagerness to push their agenda did their own argument a disservice in failing so spectacularly to address the distinction and provide any concrete facts for those viewers not already inclined to lap up whatever is placed before them.

If you are already convinced of the intrinsic evil of profit and putting scarce resources to efficient use, this vapid documentary will only tell you what you already no and add nothing to your knowledge base, leaving you no more ready to address the subject matter than before you watched it.

If you are skeptical of the original sin of efficient use of scarce resources, you will find nothing informative in this farce of a documentary and only tired ideological preaching. There are much better uses of your time.",1410220800,8,2458,4.913253012048193

Gone are the days when a middle class honest man can expect to work AND LIVE in NYC.

Think about it ... when a community's own firemen, policemen, teachers, and the like can no longer afford to live there, they become nothing more than the 'hired help' with absolutely zero ability to invest in community. A textbook incubator to further grow the 'Haves and the Have Nots' culture.

8555236,5,B00AO7IUXI,"This documentary hits the nail right on the head. As a New Yorker it's nice to hear honestly and the true causes that is making this city a Luxury City- not just Manhattan but almost all of the other boroughs. This mentality is causing the Mayor, Governor, and all law makers to give the rich ALL THE BREAKS and are taking away everything they can from the middle class and the poor.
I'm a 48-year old male medical professional, and I could NEVER buy my own house. This was when I was married with a working wife or not. Real Estate prices in Queens have been insane even after the real estate collapse in 2006. Even renting is crazy, a one room apartment will cost you over $1,000 a month and you'd be lucky to find one for that price. Average 3-room apartments are $1,200-$1,500 a month now in Queens.
I'm now permanently physically disabled with a rare disease with most symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis AND Muscular Dystrophy, plus Degenerative Disk Disease and Fibromyalgia. You'd think it would be easy for me to get a Social Worker, legal help, or assistance when I NEED it. In fact it's the exact opposite especially since I have no family and my friends disappeared when they realized how sick I was. Once the city knows that, they do even less to help you because they know you can't fight and have no one to fight for you!
Every agency had their budgets cut so much that they either cannot take new clients or totally closed programs that thousands of New Yorkers relied on. I haven't had an increase in my Social Security Disability in 7-years. On paper they say I got a $30 or $40  increase, but then they LOWER my Food Stamps by $30 or $40, so where's the increase??? Bloomberg killed NYC and we all know it, those who watch this movie will know it now too. This is what has happened to NYC and this documentary describes it very well.",1436659200,6,1847,4.432352941176471
