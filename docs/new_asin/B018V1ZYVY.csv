7556219,5,B018V1ZYVY,"This second series widens the geographical frame and leads the Shelbys to London. The Irish are definitely on the back burner and Winston Churchill is quite obviously playing a game of his own against the new cop who came from Ireland and cannot think in other terms than the IRA. Winston Churchill must be seeing beyond the Irish problem and seeing that the inner English problem is more dangerous for the crown than the Irish rebellion to which anyway they yielded then.

Thats where moving to London and trying to start an export business the Shelbys came in full confrontation with two other organized shady and fuzzy business gangs in this field of entertainment, alcohol and tobacco. The Italians and the Jews. The Italians want to be over everyone, so the Shelbys who are identified as the Gypsies tie up an alliance with the Jews against the Italians who saw the danger and then tie up a new alliance with the Jews against the Gypsies. Three groups that are defined ethnically, culturally and religiously who try to take control of the entertainment business with the enormous US market presently shaken by prohibition and yet next door to Canada which is not concerned but is a marvelous entry gate.

Those three groups are in a struggle that looks more like a war but it is essential to understand modern England. England had a bill of rights and other more common law than constitutional basic civil rights but for a long time limited to the Protestants, the Catholics being excluded. When they had to move away from this segregation they introduced or maintained (since Italian and Gypsies are Catholics and Jews are not exactly Protestants) other discriminations against other communities essentially seen as non-English. The Italians are obvious since they are of foreign origin and Mussolini is going to come to power and Italian refugees, mostly communists, are going to increase in numbers. The Jews are less obvious but anti-Semite feelings in England have always been high in the past, Shakespeare being a good example there, or Dickens. And these Jews have strange customs that are kind of shocking to the English. Finally the Gypsies have always been some kind of social enemy and social marginal group that was always engaged in shady business with the reputation of practicing prostitution, drug dealing, illegal betting and illegal fights, and many other niceties of the type.

The most dangerous fact is that they are all back from the First World War where they learned how to use weapons and how to fight and they do not want to be downtrodden any more.

In this society the real danger is the possibility for the communists to conquer a vast influence based on discontentment. So the best way is to come to terms with some of the shady groups so that they will entertain the lower classes and prevent discontentment from becoming dangerous revolutionary enterprises or adventures. In this second series this communist danger is mostly marginalized and Winston Churchill wants to take the control of the entertainment business and he considers the gypsies are the least dangerous in that line.

So while the new cop from Ireland, who does not from my point of view deserve a name because he is not doing police work but civil war military action, is going on with his plan of getting rid of one higher up military officer who has in a way or another in the new cops mind betrayed his ideals in Ireland, and whats more he is going on with his secondary plan of using Thomas Shelby to fulfill the first, Winston Churchill plans saving Thomas Shelby from the hands of this new cop from Ireland and keeping him in store for some objective we cannot know.

This exploration of discriminatory and racist England is interesting because we would not think it was like that so little time back, and yet it is the lessons learned from this period that explains the policy with various communities who have their autonomy and their self governing powers in various fields like education. What others in the world call communitarianism is totally recognized in England and it works rather well when connections and relations are established between and among the communities within city councils and borough boundaries. We are here at the roots of English reformist conservatism which kills the left most of the time who wants to impose some principles that go against practical realism in social matters.

Of course this series has to get rid of a couple of people who are blocking the future and to save a couple more without whom there would be no future. In other words the next series is thus clearly prepared.

7556240,5,B018V1ZYVY,"Well, you'd be doing yourself a disservice not watching Punky Brewsters . . . I mean, Peaky Blinders Season 2, as Major Campbell would pontificate about. The series jumps two years forward to 1922 which is brilliant as slowly is revealed what has happened to our main protagonists in those past two years. There are sadly no extras on this season's DVD set but does it really matter when it's TV this good?

A few thoughts out of the box here:
--Britain is known even today as a nation with very strict gun laws and the police (bar the specialist few) do not carry guns. Having said that, apparently in post-WWI Birmingham and London's criminal elements seem to have no problem getting and using guns. Which also begs the question as to why in Season 1 was it so hard for the IRA to procure guns that they had to resort to dealing with the Blinders?
--Does Grace have a death wish? I get she still loves Thomas Shelby, but it does seem odd why she even returns to London as if America does not have fertility doctors.
--How many lives does Thomas have? The penultimate scene makes you wonder, if they're stretching his escapeability too much.
--Is it just me or is Polly's storyline of very little interest to anyone? Even on the Season 1 DVD cover the actress shares billing with Sam Neill and Gillian Murphy, but she's hardly the 3rd wheel then or even in this season.
--Loved the talking to Thomas gives Arthur Shelby about his out-of-control violent rages and being unable to get past his own PTSD from the War but maybe Arthur is just a plain nutter. I'm beginning to think that and the War is just an excuse he uses.
--Lastly, even though the gangsters (Gypsy, Jewish or Italian) are all obviously from working class backgrounds, none of them seem interested at all in the most working-class of leisure pursuits in '20s Britain--the football matches. I get the horse racing as there's money to be made from that but legalized betting in the UK covers all sports and when you have four teams in the Birmingham area (1922 average home attendance: Aston Villa 31,700, Birmingham City 26,875, West Bromwich Albion 22,490 and Wolverhampton Wanderers 13,605) that's a HUGE chunk of betting money out there. There was a big betting scandal in 1915 regarding Liverpool and Manchester United so maybe it was too far before the Blinders' time but even so do the lads not go to the football at all? It just seems odd that even in workingmen's pubs it's never discussed.

These are the odd things I do think about when watching the series, but they are minor compared to the overall excellence of the acting, cinematography, storylines and just plain fun seeing how all these play out.",1500422400,,2679,4.626050420168068
7556241,5,B018V1ZYVY,"This is just one more coup for the Brits.  The acting (Cillian Murphy is perfect), sets, story, etc., make a very compelling series.  After the second episode in Season 1, I was totally hooked.  Now, what I want to know is where the blazes is the DVD for Season 3 for the US?  A DVD for Season 3 that will play on a normal DVD player in the United States would be nice thank you very much.  Filming for Season 4 is already underway, so for pete's sake, get the DVD for Season 3 to those of us breathlessly waiting its arrival.",1494288000,,526,4.117647058823529

7556243,5,B018V1ZYVY,"Started watching this after Taboo ended and glad I did...another great period piece from Stephen Knight (creator/writer)...lots of great music, exceptional attention to detail, and a rarely seen era (polar opposite of Downton Abbey). Birmingham is the gritty, dark setting rather than London, but when London is shown be prepared for Tom Hardy to totally steal the show - he is brilliant as usual (wish he was featured more). Cillian Murphy is great, but my favorite character is Arthur Shelby (played by Paul Anderson...definitely one to watch).

I intended to slowly watch this but devoured in about a week. Wish Season 3 DVD was available in the States but I was able to get caught up with Netflix so now I'm waiting for BOTH Taboo and Pesky Blinders lol!",1491436800,,758,4.875968992248062

7556246,3,B018V1ZYVY,"The first series was interesting enough  antiheroes, villainous good guy, stoic spy-turned-rogue. Spots of brutality and iniquity, plunging into blared non-period music, really set the tone.

Series Two doubles down so much on this that there's hardly room for anything else. Plot developments and transitions are like a formality. Hey! We're in London, trashing a place. Hey! We're back in Birmingham, trashing a place. It's as if England exists as adjacent rooms.

All those savings on storytelling leave the show with plenty of time to draw out seedy scenes so much that it's not only awkward, it's boring.

Worse, characters can now apparently hear the non-period music, too. They strut in slow motion, all but winking at the Fourth Wall before hitting or setting fire to something. If you didn't come for the fan service, be warned.",1487462400,,837,5.087591240875913

7556248,3,B018V1ZYVY,"While I will admit the acting is very good, there is not one character in this show with any redeeming value as a human being. The Peaky Blinders kill and maim at any perceived slight. Every cop is corrupt and on the take. Inspector Campbell (Sam Neill) is further revealed as complete psychopath. Grace, now supposedly happily married in New York conveniently returns to London to do the nasty with Thomas. Even Churchill - the savior and voice of England in WWII is depicted as a complete scumbag (with Campbell doing his evil bidding). This show is a adult soap opera. Plot lines make for good drama but are totally unbelievable!

I also find the inserted non-era songs during key plot points very distracting and as others have mentioned the actors local dialect is sometimes difficult to understand. By the way this is currently free on that other video service.",1485475200,4,867,4.78

7556271,5,B018V1ZYVY,"Dark-despicable-raw-bloody-corruption-violent-but fully gripping. The Roaring 1920s; flapper fantastic period excellence. The Shelby family of Birmingham England are gypsies in the organized crime scene. Peaky Blinders make The Godfather look like a park walk. The action is fast, and a bizarre twist is always around the next corner. Excellent writing. The DVD box stems to offer no warning, but his series is definitely adult oriented. Every youth/family warning term used on other DVDs would be appropriate warning for Peaky Blinders. Season Two picks up where One ended with the family, a hint you should watch them in order.

The Shelby family includes Tommy (Cillian Murphy), Arthur (Paul Anderson Revenant) who turns from whisky to drugs, Ada (Sophie Rundle Bletchley Circle), John (Joe Cole), and Aunt Polly Gray (Helen McCrory Harry Potter). All are in every episode from day one, but don't turn your back on any of them. Season 2 adds Michael (Finn Cole).

7556274,5,B018V1ZYVY,"Season Two of Peaky Blinders starts off a lot like the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dallas/dp/B00028G7LG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dallas</a>&nbsp;many years ago.  The question of ""Who got shot?"" at the train station is answered.  To say now would be a sin to those who've yet to find out.  I'll leave it to those to look at the discs and either figure it out for themselves or watch the first episode of Season Two and figure out who made it out of Dodge.

Peaky Blinders just gets better and better with each episode.  John's wife, Esme (Welsh actress Aimee-Ffion Edwards) is introduced as is Polly's long lost son Michael Gray (Finn Cole).  Both add a nice bit of spice to the mix.  Tommy (Cillian Murphy) is still top of the heap with brothers Arthur and John (Paul Anderson and Joe Cole) still thumping and breaking heads.  Michael (Finn Cole, Joe's brother) begins work on the legitimate end of Shelby Brothers, LTD.

(The only thing that came close to BB was ""Hannibal"" but that fell apart in Season 3.)  PB has intrigue, murder, mayhem, love triangles, spies, gangs, coppers,  the IRA, Gypsies, bootleggers, gorgeous horses, fabulous cinematography, and a groundbreaking score. The writing is top-notch and often quite poetic. But it would not be nearly the same show without Cillian Murphy, who plays Tommy Shelby, the most memorable central character since Walter White. He is ruthless, haunted, protective, violent, tough, fragile, romantic, and mesmerising to watch. What amazes me about CM is that he in real life he is slight, boyish, and pretty.  I thought--how is this delicate-looking guy going to pull off being a gangster? But pull it off he does. He  bulked up his slight body for the role, but more than that--he uses his angelic looks to contrast his character's ruthless persona. He also lowers his voice an octave to play Tommy. The result? He doesn't become Tommy--he IS Tommy. Without his performance, this show would not be nearly what it is. At any rate, this is MUST-SEE TV!",1456704000,8,1254,4.900943396226415
