8715008,4,B00X4Z5WTC,"This is another example of how Australia can make great films on tiny budgets.

What you get is found footage spliced together with a number of interviews purporting to be a report on 'real' missing persons cases. It has been done before but this film works extremely well when a group of kids go to a farmhouse out in the Australian country to perform a ritual, to 'Beckon the Butcher'. The interviews break up the found footage and provide context to what the found footage is showing you.

Although thoroughly entertaining I have two issues with the film - firstly much of the found footage is so grainy that you can't always get a good sense of what is going on. Secondly, there really aren't enough scares. The scares are implied or you get fleeting glimpses but not enough to be really satisfying. The filmmakers seemed to have made this decision on purpose as there are three deleted scenes included on the disk that I thought would have worked better than what was actually used.

The film is extraordinarily short and clocks in at just under 70 minutes - great if you don't have a lot of time to spare and the film does get told satisfactorily in the time given, with a decent wrap-up at the end.",1468540800,,1205,4.518348623853211
