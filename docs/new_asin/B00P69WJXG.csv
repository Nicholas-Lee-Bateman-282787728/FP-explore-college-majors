6787687,5,B00P69WJXG,"Great movie if you like that kind of thing.  Has a heart, comedy, tragedy, and Will Smith...what else can you ask for?  I know, plenty.  But Jersey Girl is currently my favorite Kevin Smith movie.",1425945600,,196,4.542857142857143
6787708,5,B00P69WJXG,"Absolutely love this movie! Kevin Smith at his best! The movie was shunned by reviewers and media, and I really am not quite sure it is fairly deserved. Witty, funny, cute, and subtle romance mixed with some moments of tense drama. After seeing ""Dogma"" (another favorite!), and the Jay & Silent Bob series of films, this one is a refreshing break from the bonehead humor (don't misunderstand me, I LOVE me some bonehead humor! Just saying it's nice to take a short breather every now and then!). My 15 year-old stepdaughter asked to see a Ben Affleck movie. Rented this on Google Play and she LOVED it as well! By the end of the movie I had grabbed the Blu-Ray from Amazon. She's watched it a few times since. :)",1487808000,,712,4.484615384615385

8686489,3,B00P69WJXG,"I am very fond of this movie. However, there are no subtitles, which is highly irregular for a Blu-ray. This isn't the seller's fault, but it makes sharing this movie with some of my loved ones difficult.",1528502400,,204,4.54054054054054
