2393090,5,B000ATQYXI,"Having watched the show when it first aired on CBS, I was delighted when I saw a marathon on the Sci-fi channel a few years ago. I have been craving this short series on DVD ever since. On Oct 25th, I will get my wish. Smart, dark, and featuring a great cast, American Gothic seemed ahead of it's time.

The main star of the show is Gary Cole, who plays the mysterious and evil Sherrif Lucas Buck. Most people would know Gary Cole as Lumberg from Office Space, but that recognition would slowly drain away as they watched him portray Buck. If Jamey Sheridan couldn't have played Randall Flagg in Stephen King's The Stand, I would have preferred Cole take the role.

This show is great for any sci-fi drama fan.",1124755200,,710,4.412213740458015
2393091,5,B000ATQYXI,"As 'Bruce' said. This DVD series is looonng overdue. So many series that are actually worth watching are nowadays not even given a chance! How many times have you gotten into a series (as 'Firefly' or 'John Doe') and have it go down the drain? I am so glad that they finally decided to release this DVD.

Sheriff Buck is my favorite character. Although, I do love Caleb's accent! He's cute as well as a great actor and character. His sister's haunting appearances are certainly worth waiting for. When I was younger and I watched this series, I think I wanted watch her and see her, as much as her little brother in the series did!

I hope eventually TV will start making series like these again, and give them the chance to be enjoyed! This is a great series for anyone interested in Drama, Action, Horror, Sci-Fi. All around great series. Good actors, great characters!",1124582400,4,871,4.576923076923077
2393092,5,B000ATQYXI,"This DVD set is long overdue. Loooong overdue. In our recent move from DC to Colorado, I threw out all of our recorded VHS tapes--except for the ones with ""American Gothic"". Now I can get rid of those as well, but for the right reason.

Like ""Firefly"", ""American Gothic"" is a unique, outstanding series never given a chance by its network (CBS, in this case). It was also probably the most chilling and disturbing series ever to air, a stark morality tale with Gary Cole as the Devil incarnate (or a close kin), disguised as Sheriff Lucas Buck of the small town of Trinity, SC. Buck rules over his little kingdom with morbid humor and playfulness, setting up moral pitfalls and dilemmas for the town's inhabitants, and dispensing his own brand of justice or vengance or just plain meanness--which often involves ruin, insanity, dismemberment, or death.

Opposing Buck is young Caleb Temple (played by Lucas Black), an orphan who talks regularly to his dead sister Merlyn and who has powers of his own--and who may or may not be Buck's son. Buck wants Caleb to follow him; Merlyn wants Caleb to resist; and the rest of Trinity gets caught in the crossfire, so to speak.

The writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. You'll never look at Gary Cole the same way again. Or, for that matter, Shaun Cassidy--yes, the ""Hardy Boys"" teen heart-throb [thanks for the corrections, everyone!]--who conceived and produced the show, along with Sam Raimi (""Evil Dead"", ""Army of Darkness"", ""Spider-Man"").",1124150400,193,1499,4.893700787401575
2393113,5,B000ATQYXI,"This is by far one of my favorite series out there. You won't be disappointed. It's a must-have for everyone's DVD Library. Gary Cole is amazing. You want to hate him. Sometimes you do. He's very handsome and charming though.. his acting skills run from  beloved 2  devious. He's a very good actor. My daughters are, ""American Horror Story"" fans;  they love Merlin.  ""Fast and Furious"" fans will love the little boy. This is how he started.  I have loved this show since it came out on television many years ago. I was so happy to see it come out on.",1496448000,,550,4.405940594059406
2393114,5,B000ATQYXI,I think it is a very good show,1493596800,,30,2.875
2393115,5,B000ATQYXI,"Warning!  Episodes out of order!!  Look up the right order and watch accordingly or be sorely confused.  The show is amazing, with a mesmerizing bad guy versus the girl he murdered battling over the soul of a young boy.",1488844800,,219,4.564102564102564

2393118,5,B000ATQYXI,"DO NOT BUY THE DVDs!

They are notoriously bad: some work, some don't, and regardless the episodes were not aired in correct order (probably part of why it was cancelled, too hard for the average potato to follow), and therefore, of course they couldn't release them on DVD (or in the streaming version?) in correct order.

For those who want to know the PROPER order in which to view:
""Pilot""
""A Tree Grows in Trinity""
""Eye of the Beholder""
""Damned If You Don't""
""Potato Boy""
""Dead To The World""
""Meet the Beetles""
""Strong Arm of the Law""
""To Hell and Back""
""The Beast Within""
""Rebirth""
""Ring of Fire""
""Resurrector""
""Inhumanitas""
""The Plague Sower""
""Doctor Death Takes a Holiday""
""Learning to Crawl""
""Echo of Your Last Goodbye""
""Strangler""
""Triangle""
""The Buck Stops Here""
""Requiem""

If you DO buy the DVDs you will have to swap discs almost every single episode in order to view them in the proper order... Fair warning. Also:

SPOILERS FROM HERE DOWN.

So, this show is SUPER old, but I think it's amazing... Before True Blood tried to talk about the evils of a small town and the hidden devils, this show was literally remarking on these things without all the excessive nudity (I love TB, read the books and found them better but the show just lost it's mind... and even Emilia Clarke has said, nudity is no big but if it adds nothing to the story it's just gratuitous.)

It's interesting to see all the threads of possibility that sadly never got explored due to being cancelled... Is Gail Caleb's sister? How does Caleb turn out? What about Buck? Is he changed by the experiences at the end of the season?

Anyway. Highly recommended.",1485475200,6,1641,4.657439446366782

2393120,1,B000ATQYXI,"I had this set on my wish list. I received it from my brother for Christmas this year. The dvd's are the poorest quality of any I have ever had. The third disc is non playable, as it freezes every other frame. The episodes are completely out of order, and the list goes on. As I didn't purchase these I am unable to return them, and do not want to put my brother through the hassle. I would hope that these will be released again and be the quality they should be. I am disappointed that amazon still offers these when it's clear by the ratings they are such bad quality.

I streamed about two minutes of one of the old episodes, which turned off the return order button.  So I had to go through a video chat.  Hopefully the funds will be returned.

I suggest  to Amazon that they make it clearer that if you buy the season after watching the new pilot that you're getting a 16 year old version of the show.",1468022400,,441,4.253012048192771

2393188,4,B000ATQYXI,"The good news is that this release (currently also being offered at Wally World for $13) is single sided dvd discs.  Not the cruddy dual sided discs of the earlier release.  The bad news is the episodes are still in the air date order.  So to watch them in the correct order, you'll have to keep swapping discs.  Not sure if the quality of the picture is any better than the previous release, it doesn't look like anything was cleaned up, but using a player that provides up conversion gives a fair picture.",1466380800,2,507,4.419354838709677

2393192,4,B000ATQYXI,Terrific series with an unbeatable cast. They're making so many of these kind of shows now but none of them compare to this. This rerelease is in a regular size case and probably still on double sided discs and with episodes in the wrong order. It would require so little effort by Universal to fix these problems.,1464825600,,314,4.526315789473684
2393193,3,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic is a 20 year old tv series. It is interesting, scary, chilling, well-written and very well-acted, so it effectively stands the test of time. However, since the advent of graphic dramas such as American Horror Story, The Walking Dead, Sons of Anarchy, etc. any show from the 90's does seem tame. Yet, American Gothic 1995 is has a chilling plot and very scary moments and definitely worth the viewers time.",1464566400,,421,4.861111111111111

2393195,4,B000ATQYXI,I remember watching this show as a elementary schoolil kid with my mother way back when. It was so mysterious and mystical and had an aspect that for some reason I have always loved....bad guys being bad...and getting ahead because of it! I remember that one day it just wasn't on anymore and it stuck with me so much that I remembered it so many years later and found it on Prime! These days if this show was being aired for the first time? It would probably be on season 16 by now lol. But alas it only made it through one season.    The one negative thing I have to say is that I will never understand why if networks are planning to END a show why not at the very LEAST tie up the major questions raised tougfhout its run?

2393240,1,B000ATQYXI,"I loved this series. It was spooky, creepy and atmospheric.  All the things a good scary movie should be, rolled into a series.  Shaun Cassidy did a great job with it, but it got cancelled after only one season, like his SciFi ""Invasion,"" another great show.

I'm not crazy about this set, though. There are only a few episodes on each side of each disc, and the discs aren't clearly labeled!  The disc only has a small ring telling you which side you're playing.  And, I'm never sure if I've seen ALL the episodes on each side, since it sometimes shows the menu before all episodes are played.  The case isn't much help there, either.  It lists all the episodes on the disc, but doesn't say which episodes are on which side.

Some episodes are rather grainy, too. Noticeably grainy, and distracting.

But, I still love the series, and I'm glad to have it in my collection.

Update:  My discs are defective.  I am returning them for a new set.  So far 3 episodes have stuck and got my player sounding like its having a breakdown!  I'm making like Santa, only MY list is of the defective episodes on the discs!  I'm sending them back for a replacement set.",1456358400,,1155,4.45933014354067

At any rate, I love this show and but was disappointed with the poor resolution.  I wasn't expecting HD quality but neither was I expecting such poor resolution, It was blurry and dark in some spots and a few episodes froze then skipped forward.  Target wouldn't exchange the defective item because it was beyond the 30 days, which I believed to be 90 days, so, it was my fault in not checking return policy, nonetheless, after speaking to a few reps they agreed to exchange the item considering it was defective.  I never received the replacement and when calling back I was told that they changed their mind.  I will no longer purchase DVDs from Target.

I then contacted Universal via email to hopefully secure an exchange through them, no reply.  So, I'm stuck with useless discs that I cannot watch, but the cover is very well made and just lovely.  If only they had put such effort into the discs.",1424822400,2,1181,4.684466019417476

It is great to have the complete series on DVD in spite of the fact that the episodes are not in the order intended by the creators.

I started watching it because I am a big fan of American Horror Story and I found this while Wikipedia-ing one day. Sarah Paulson is just as great in American Gothic as she is in Season 2 of American Horror story. The plot is exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The main character, Lucas Black, who stares at the child Caleb, is a well developed character and gives an extremely convincing performance.

For those who are a big fan of V C Andrews, this plot line has a lot of the same themes as her novels. Family betrayal, deception, fear, and of course, a bad guy you love to hate. Highly highly recommend!",1356739200,,748,4.267605633802817
2393434,3,B000ATQYXI,"I have absolutely no problem with the series, except that it could have gone on longer!  It was very captivating, if you're familiar with such ""gothic"" (ghost stories) tales eminating from the south (US), then this series might be of interest to you.  Well staged, well shot, great acting, including Lucas Black's stellar performance as but a young boy, caught-up in all the trauma and drama of a small town's haunting!

All well and good!  But the package I received contained 2 copies of the first disc (episodes 1-7), and one copy of the third disc (episodes 16-22), but NO copy of the second DVD (episodes 8-15)!  Now reading other reviews of this particular set and I see that the episodes are not even featured in the correct order on the DVD's!  It's a disgrace!  Why offer a product which is faulty and expect fans to enjoy it closed-mouthed, regardless of the quality and erroneous content?

I am returning my set because they do not offer a way to receive a replacement DVD (where I could trade-in one of the extra copies I have of the first DVD) for the second, missing DVD!  And it doesn't make any difference whether I go through Amazon.com (which only offers a refund for the return of the whole set), or through Universal's ""[...]"" online TV store!  And this is true even though with the latter, I didn't ask for a replacement; but merely asked if there was a way I could obtain a copy of that second DVD, as in, I would pay separately for it!  NOPE!  Forget it!

I have had good success buying items through Amazon, and do not hold this problem against them.  But somewhere along the line this product is NOT being supported or delivered as advertized!  I just want the complete set as advertized!  Is that too much to ask???

Sincerely!

2393438,4,B000ATQYXI,"I loved this show back in the 90's when it originally aired. So much so, that I waited years to see the last episode, after it was released on DVD, since the show's air time was moved around so many times by the network and sometimes wasn't aired at all. The episodes on the DVDs were out of order, entered by air date and not in chronological order. But that was easily fixed by manually selecting each episode I wanted to watch. I'm not sure if the download version has addressed this problem yet, as I'm only three episodes in.

I was hoping the download would be better than the DVD, but sadly, the first episode was really dark and grainy and I had to ""Pop Out"" to another screen to see it at all. By the way, my laptop is only a few months old, so I know that isn't the problem. Besides, I haven't had this problem  streaming anything else. The quality of the second and third episodes was better, but I also ""Popped"" them out, too. I'm also disappointed that there isn't a Closed Captioning option. Maybe there is, but I haven't found it yet. I stream on NETFLIX all the time. Their options are easy to find and use and the video and sound quality are great. This is my first streaming experience on Amazon and there are some problems that really should be simple to fix.  For example, it should automatically play the next episode of any show. I don't like that I have to go back to the library to choose the next episode. There should be a way to set this feature to auto-play all the episodes back to back.

I don't know if the quality issue is unique to this show, since it predates most of the digital age, or if this is an indication of Amazon's general download video quality. I was thinking of signing up for Prime, but now I'm having second thoughts. Then again, maybe this problem is unique and other people who buy this show won't have the problems I'm having. It's a great show. I've always wished there were more episodes. And I will watch all of the episodes I have now, despite the quality issue. So if you've missed it and wanted to see it again try it out. Maybe you won't notice the tech issues. Or maybe you won't care.",1347062400,4,2145,4.288888888888889

2393470,5,B000ATQYXI,"Wondering what Lucas Black was doing before ""Legion""?  I'd have to classify him as one of my favorite child actors.  Between Sling Blade and American Gothic, I think you'll get a good sense of what I'm talking about.  The only complaint I have of the series is that it doesn't really end.  But the story is great and compelling.  Sit down with a snack and have yourself an American Gothic marathon.  You won't be disappointed.",1344038400,,426,4.613333333333333
2393471,5,B000ATQYXI,"This ill-fated series contains some of the best-written (and delivered) dialogue you will ever hear on a TV show. It brings to mind some of the most literate scripts from 1940s movies (especially of the more Noirish kind) it's so witty, sophisticated, and unpredictable. A bon mot comes along every few lines or so; in fact it's worthy of ""All About Eve"" at its best. I've been bored by the mundane scripts of pretty well every modern TV show and this came as the most refreshing antidote.

What's more, the actors' delivery of these lines is nigh on perfect, especially Gary Cole as the enigmatic Sheriff Lucas Buck and Brenda Bakke as the schoolteacher cum smalltown femme fatale. Cole's timing is about as good as I've ever heard from any actor and I kept on wondering why Bakke isn't more of a name she has so much presence.

Still, there is a problem. Dramatically, this series is a bit of a mess. It sets things up nicely but then doesn't appear to know how to proceed. There are lots of half-digested ideas but not (until near the end when most of the original viewers were already lost) a satisfying meal. Threads are left hanging, episodes peter out, it's as if the writers are making it up as they go along. Then, with about six episodes to go it all starts to come together and you're left wishing the series could've gone on to a second season.

One last thing: if you're looking for horror this probably won't please you. It's more black humour than fright night. Sheriff Buck is supposed to be evil incarnate according to some accounts but in many ways he's the hero of the story; he's the one who keeps the town together despite the odd body or two. AND he has most of the best lines. A pity he couldn't have survived for another series or two to keep on delivering more.",1320105600,3,1786,4.47239263803681
2393472,5,B000ATQYXI,"And one of the best TV shows ever. A gothic drama mixing many genres, often masterfully, with performances both brilliant and haunting as to stay with you forever. More than stay with you, they have an inspired impact on you, whether Gary Cole or Jake Weber or, amazingly, Lucas Black who turned in, IMHO, one of the best, fanfreakingtastic performances on screen. This kid is beyond words.

The show's story is original and uncompromising. It makes you laugh, cringe, think, afraid, mad and mostly want more.

The story of this show's sabotage is better explained by others than me on the internet. Google the facts. Why would they kill a show like this? What I do know is that art & entertainment loses out. If you're the kind of person who love the gothic, horror genre, look up fanfic continuation of this cult classic that died horrifically before its time.

A proper review would go on in praises for actors, writers, directors, producers, creators and so on for pages.

One I will mention is Shaun Cassidy. I tip my hat off to you, sir. You are wonderful, as a storyteller, creator, writer. As is also seen in your recent show, also sadly killed, Invasion. Keep it up, you are a bright light so keep shining. And thank you for ""American Gothic"".

I say that because I haven't finished it, but like most people on here, I'm wondering why it didn't get a second season.
As for the intended order of viewing it, I'm trying to take each episode on its own terms, in other words, as seperate stories. I do however wish Dr. Crower could've stayed in longer. Kudos to Gary Cole for his subtly menacing role as the obviously evil Sherrif of Trinity. I do look forward to seeing how they wrap this up, hopefully some loose ends will be explained, we'll see.",1307318400,,677,4.424

It had a great cast and one of my personal all time favorite villians in a tv seriese in sherieff Lucas Buck. So I was extremly pleased to find one of my favorite tv shows from the past at such an reasonable price. This show is a must have for anyone who loves shows with a supernatural story them, such as Supernatural, Twin peaks and so on. The shows themselves were great but this set had a few annoyances to them, one of them being that the episodes are not listed on the disc in the correct order, which really shouldn't suprise as seeing how when they were first aired they weren't in order as well. You'd think that considering it had been I think 15 years since the show first aired they could have at least gotten the episodes in the correct order for the dvd release, and the only other complain I have is that they're on those darn dual sided disc and I personally can't stand them, but overal the set is definitly worth picking up.",1299110400,2,1118,4.2046511627906975
2393475,5,B000ATQYXI,"I don't normally write product reviews, but I just finished American Gothic and enjoyed it so thoroughly that I decided to do so.

Novels and television series are my two favorite hobbies, and I pursue both extensively. Thus, I feel that my experience will be of help to similarly minded individuals who are wondering whether or not to take this series seriously and invest time and money into it, both because of its commercial appeal and hokey packaging (which is, in a word, terrible). I can safely say that you should not be deterred, as American Gothic represents one of those rare works that manages to hold the attention of both the passive viewer and the attentive, high brow consumer. Basically, it's a captivating series for those who just want to watch, but it also holds a world more than that.

Really, American Gothic was what I was hoping to get out of Carnivale. That's not to take away from Carnivale, which I thought was great, but was a show that really wasn't able to blossom in the brevity it incurred by being cut short. American Gothic, however, still pulls it off. The elements of thematic darkness in the show are executed to near perfection, subtle enough to feel truly haunting but present enough that you don't necessarily feel comfortable watching it past midnight. And, as with many shows, this comes on the strongest in the earliest episodes, which are heavily nuanced and introduce a number of phrases and motifs that recur throughout the show. Furthermore, the influence of William Faulkner on the writers is extremely evident, as each character seems to be searching for recognition and validation of their identity by others, usually as it is defined by family circumstances. Oftentimes people doubt how intentional such references may be, but anyone who's read Faulkner will see all the riffing almost immediately, especially when a character by the name of Wash Sutpen, who kills a man over his behavior towards his daughter, is introduced.

Additionally, Lucas Black's performance as 10 year old Caleb Temple is absolutely stunning. He is perhaps the best actor in the entire show, behind only Gary Cole, who really succeeds in filling out the character of Lucas Buck. It seems almost that the role was written for him, and that he had been born to play it.

In the end, what the show amounts to is the tale of epic struggle between good and evil, on more and more extrapolated levels. Generally, within each episode, main characters as well as secondary characters struggle with that same theme as it relates to some aspect of their own lives, usually in grappling with a deal they've previously made with Cole's character. Deals with the devil run rampant, but it's bigger than that as well. The entire series focus on Caleb's formative experience in drifting between the two sides, at times resisting Buck's influence and at times embracing it, and the early termination of the show does actually contribute in a positive, if minute, manner, resisting resolution and instead leaving open the question of which side eventually will come out on top. And, as in the works of Faulkner, it's often surprising who's responsible for what. Sometimes the lowliest characters, as with the case of Ben and his son's abusive stepfather, are capable of the most heroic acts, in an inversion that is truly inspiring. At others, some of the dearest and most kindly-hearted characters, even the guardian angel Merlyn herself, disappoint and let us down. The show always pulls it off too, with that irresistible combination of subtlety and inversion that allows for resonance within the viewer, chiefly from their own mental involvement with the development of the plot and characters.

For the serious consumer of media, literature both southern gothic and otherwise, and avid television fan, this is a show not to be missed. In a phrase, it views like a diluted and more straightforward David Lynch meets a modern day Faulkner writing for TV and, perhaps most importantly, can be watched alongside any other sort of viewer, even those who don't care to dig deeper and who are jumping in in the middle. This is a keeper, do not hesitate!",1293580800,8,4162,4.90625
2393476,1,B000ATQYXI,"I watched the first few episodes of this and had to give it up.  In the immortal words of Popeye, ""I can't stands no more.""  Other viewers have pointed out that the episodes are out of order, implying that everything would be jake if we just watched this in sequence.  But that's not the entire difficulty from my viewpoint.  ""Pulp Fiction"" was intentionally jumbled but could be pieced together.

Let's start with the writing and plot.  These make no sense, regardless of how one arranges things, and I lost patience with the whole mess.  Weird music and sound effects are used in a futile attempt to make the viewer think a scene is dramatic and scary.  The camera quivers, which I suspect is to imply eerieness.  Blood runs up walls to spell out messages presaging doom--from where? by whom?

The acting is laughably and falsely intense.  The only one I remotely believed was the boy.  At least he had a believable accent.

I fully realize that some viewers have hypnotized themselves into believing this was a scary and dramatic series, but it is on a level with ""The Blair Witch Project,"" which was the worst piece of nonsense ever foisted on the viewing public.",1290643200,3,1167,4.661764705882353

2393499,5,B000ATQYXI,My 71 yr old Mom is OBSSESED with American Gothic. She started watching the reruns on cable and will watch all day if it plays all day. She loves loves loves Gary Cole. Since the cable company doesnt show it daily I surprised her and bought the series. She does not go a day without watching it on DVD and cable. I was forced to sit and watch and I have to agree the show was great and it left way before it's time. My biggest complaint is reading the other reviews and finding out sadly that some of the episodes are out of order. It was hard to explain the order to her especially since she has them all in her head. Plus it is difficult and was confusing to her to switch the DVDs around(side a side b)so to now tell her the episodes are not right. Not Good. Good thing is its out of order she doesnt care(we always seem to care more than them) so this ended up being one of the best gifts I could ever buy her. Thanks,1274313600,4,921,4.010869565217392

2393502,5,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic is set in the rural south lands of America, and brings to life the Hoodoo Voodoo atmosphere associated with that locale (much in the likeness of ""Skeleton Key"").  The main threat is one Sheriff Buck, who we learn is more than human - perhaps a demon or at the very least, under the control of one?  His main opponent is one of his own making - the spirit of an innocent girl who he, himself, brutally murdered.  The prize being fought over is the soul of the girl's younger brother, who, also, just happens to be Sheriff Buck's son.

This battle of good vs. evil is anything but typical.  There are a number of twists and turns to keep one guessing.  And, along the way, we discover that no one is purely good or purely evil - that we always have both options at our command but, we don't always choose wisely.  Then, again, sometimes we do!

American Gothic is just dark enough to be spooky, and still balanced enough to give faith more than even chance at victory.  This would be a great TV night contribution throughout October leading up to Halloween.  I'd recommend it for mature teens and adults.

Others have rightly complained about the poor recording quality of the disks - that they stick, etc., and that the episodes are out of order - and they are right on both counts.  My set works but the episodes are out of order.  Even so, I'm giving the series 5 stars and  2 thumbs up because creative genius shouldn't be denied because of the blunders of a ""manufacturing-challenged"" corporation.",1258934400,3,1516,4.525735294117647
2393503,5,B000ATQYXI,This series was awesome when it was on tv and then to actually own it and watch it now is great! I wish Shawn Cassidy would bring back a sequel!,1252713600,,144,3.8333333333333335
2393504,5,B000ATQYXI,"Back in 1995, horror maestro Sam Raimi and newbie writer/producer Shaun Cassidy combined their talents to bring this single-season Southern Gothic chiller to life.  Set in the fictional small town of Trinity, South Carolina, ""American Gothic"" follows the diabolical, charismatic local sheriff Lucas Buck (Gary Cole), as he destroys lives, works to compromise the handful of Trinity residents bold or foolhardy enough to resist him, and attempts to corrupt his estranged ten-year-old son, Caleb (Lucas Black).  Facing off against Buck are a tough reporter from out of town (Paige Turco), a depressive doctor (Jake Weber), and a literally avenging angel (Sarah Paulson); ambiguously allied with him are a smokin'-hot sadomasochistic schoolteacher (Brenda Bakke) and the easily bullied deputy sheriff (Nick Searcy).

Though ""American Gothic"" was marketed as a horror thriller, most of its scares are of the metaphysical kind.  In a subversive twist on the ""Touched By an Angel"" model, most episodes see the ambiguously supernatural Sheriff Buck wreaking ruin in the lives of Trinity's residents.  For the good sheriff, leading hapless, greedy, and/or unlucky townspeople to their damnation is all in a day's work: he'll offer down-on-their luck, desperate, or ambitious townsfolk what they want... just so long as they promise to return the favor down the line. And when the sheriff comes to collect, inevitably in a way his debtors don't anticipate... well, then there's be hell to pay. Literally.

Though ""American Gothic"" does have recurring themes and a few developing plot threads, it's mostly episodic, and strikingly unformulaic in its execution.  One episode follows an investigation by reporter Gail into a long-forgotten crime (""Dead to the World""); another focuses on a family who futilely tries to defy Buck (""Damned If You Don't""); another has Buck teaching Caleb twisted life lessons while both are held hostage by desperate criminals (""Learning to Crawl"").  Viewers who love ambiguity and variety in their storytelling will be in heaven.  Those who expect straightforward plot progression, which is suggested by the first few episodes, will probably be frustrated.  The lack of clear development for many of the characters can be off-putting-- in one episode, for example, deputy Ben has a breakthrough (the standout ""Echo of Your Last Goodbye""), but seems to revert back to his old self in the next.

Still, what some will see as the show's main weakness (its constant flitting between characters and storylines) is also one of its strengths-- it's continually exploring different sides of the unusually multifaceted characters. Buck may act like a flat-out villain in one story, but in the next he's restoring order to Trinity by bringing criminals into line or meting out his particular brand of justice to the town's most selfish and depraved citizens.  Viewers will have plenty to think about: do they find themselves rooting for Buck, in spite of the fact that he's undeniably evil?  Are the heroes' lapses forgivable, or should the audience feel vindicated when their bad decisions catch up with them?  How can anyone maintain their integrity and make the right choices in a place where evil has so much sway?

Supported by uniformly strong, intelligent writing, and featuring memorable, well rounded characters and great acting, ""American Gothic"" makes for absolutely compelling viewing.  Very highly recommended.

One important note: in this DVD set, the episodes are presented in the mixed-up original broadcast order rather than the correct viewing order.  Since the network seriously jumbled the chronology of the episodes, it's definitely worth the hassle to watch them in the intended order.  The correct order is listed at imdb.com: [...]",1246147200,5,3765,5.350847457627118

2393519,4,B000ATQYXI,"As another reviewer mentioned, this show should have been as hot as the X-files- the writing was better right from the start and the acting cannot be beat.

Gary Cole gives the performance of a lifetime as a devil incarnate- so seductive and yet so evil- he manages to manipulate the audience so adroitly you don't even realize how much you've been manipulated til the credits role. Lucas Black is unmatched in talent especially for one so young.

A dvd of this show should serve up some incredible commentary and loads of extras. After all, the fans that this show still has, 10+ years later, is a tell-tale sign that a dvd release would be met with success.

Well, we fans finally have what we've been waiting for, but its served up with some flaws.  Namely, as other reviewers have mentioned, the episodes are out of order.  Why????  How hard would it have been to put them in order? And how confused will newbies be because of this?  Not cool.

Also, there are a few welcomed extras but not enough.  They could have done so much more! I mean, the calibre of people involved with this show just screams for multiple commentaries and perhaps a little featurette at least!  At least there's some commentary from the mastermind behind the show, the multi-talented Shaun Cassidy.

That said, it is a real treat to see this show on DVD FINALLY after all these years, so its worth buying.  I just wish Universal had gotten their act together and done the show justice.",1230595200,,1465,4.592307692307692

2393521,5,B000ATQYXI,"Every single genre fan knows what it is like to suffer that terrible sense of loss you can only undergo when one of your favorite television series has been cancelled, because it happens to us all the time! Its infinitely worse than a death in the family because shows of this calibre are a rarity and relatives are a dime a dozen--mine are at any rate. I'll bet that every one of you could sit down right now (well, you're probably sitting already, so scratch that) and make a list of ten shows that you loved with all your heart that never made it out of their first season. Am I right? Sure I am. My own list would include some real obscure shows like QUARK (about intergalactic garbage collectors), WIZARDS AND WARRIORS (it lasted 8 whole episodes!), STRANGE DAYS, EERIE INDIANA, WONDERFALLS, THE ADVENTURES OF BRISCO COUNTY JR., which is the only one that comes close to qualifying as a big success story, and last but not least AMERICAN GOTHIC. Now THERE was a real winner!

AMERICAN GOTHIC  which aired in 1995 was the brain-child of Shaun Cassidy,(yes, that Shaun Cassidy) and was produced by Sam Raimi's Renaissance Pictures company. It was set in the fictional town of Trinity, South Carolina, and for 22 episodes it exposed the unsuspecting American public to more Evil and nasty goings on than they had any right to hope for. The town was aptly named for no matter what smaller stories seemed to be going on from week to week, there was always a greater story being played out in Trinity; Stories that involved Sheriff Lucas Buck played by Gary Cole with just the right amount of restrained leer and sneer. It was the  Sheriff was at the heart of everything the happened in Trinity. Did he just have the devil in him, or was he really The Devil? And where you found the Sheriff most often was hanging around young Caleb Temple (Lucas Black, from SLING BLADE), because it turned out that the Sheriff might actually be the orphaned boy's real father--and Buck just wanted to bring the boy into the family business. And where Caleb went you frequently found his sister Merlyn--even though she was murdered in the series' first episode, she was an angelic presence who still liked to hang around and try and guide Caleb down the right path. So Trinity literally has its very own version of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. Only in this case they were usually at each other's throats--in a genteel  sothern kind of satanic way. But make no mistake about it, if you have an appetite for the weird, the eerie, or a more plausible version of TWIN PEAKS, then this is the show for you.

From the beginning AMERICAN GOTHIC was plagued by problems and found itself the center of controversy. In the first episode for instance Merlyn's murder was deemed too graphic and a long battle with network censor's ended in having the SOUND of her neck being broken removed from the soundtrack. Censors are strange animals, aren't they? You can see it, but you can't hear it. When they weren't battling the censor's they were having problems with scheduling, the series was constantly being bumped for this reason or that--furthermore episodes were being shown out of order. It was a mess. Four episodes were never shown period. The fact that the series managed to build up any fan base at all is nothing short of miraculous. But miracles do happen, and nearly everyone who watched this series became hooked on it and lived for the day when the DVDs would be released and they could finally see it the way it should be seen--in order and in its entirity!

Of course, nothing is perfect. THE EPISODES ON THE DVD ARE NOT PRESENTED IN THE PROPER ORDER! They should be viewed as follows: 1. PILOT 2. A TREE GROWS IN TRINITY 3. EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 4. DAMNED IF YOU DO 5. POTATO BOY 6. DEAD TO THE WORLD 7. MEET THE BEETLES 8. STRONG ARM OF THE LAW 9. TO HELL AND BACK  10. THE BEAST WITHIN 11. REBIRTH 12. RING OF FIRE 13. RESURRECTION
14. INHUMANITAS 15. THE PLAGUE SOWER 16. DOCTOR DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY 17. LEARNING TO CRAWL 18. ECHO OF YOUR LAST GOODBYE 19. STRANGLER 20. TRIANGLE  21. THE BUCK STOPS HERE  22. REQUIEM

Episodes of interest from a fannish perspective are #2 ""A Tree Grows in Trinity"" which features Arnold Vosloo who starred in Raimi's direct to video DARKMAN 2&3, as well as in HARD TARGET which Raimi produced for John Woo as his first American flick. #7 ""Meet the Beetles"" which stars Bruce Campbell as a cop who could never be able to come back for a sequel. And #19 ""Learning to Crawl"" in which Sam's brother Ted Raimi has a rather large part as a semi-vicious criminal who serves as an object lesson for young Caleb.

AMERICAN GOTHIC'S current dvd release has discs with episodes on both sides. There is precious little in the was of special features--a few deleted scenes and some commentary from Cassidy on the pilot episode. Nonetheless its worth having because for the first time all 22 episodes are here, commercial free just waiting for you to discover them. Perhaps they are a bit heavy handed in some places, perhaps they are hindered by the limitations of tv special effects in the mid '90s, but none of that changes the fact that this series was an earth shaker was a sly, wicked sense of humor. Perfect for Halloween.",1224201600,9,5249,4.5615711252653925
2393522,4,B000ATQYXI,"""Lucas Buck. That's Buck, with a B."" And indeed, Gary Cole is terrific as the sheriff of a seemingly quiet, southern town, but where strange and unexplained occurrences make it ""just another day in Trinity,"" as one of the characters says.

American Gothic is a great show, and I was happy to find it on DVD ... however, the person or persons who put the episodes together was NOT paying attention! As several of the other reviewers have said, this DVD set is not in order, so if you buy it please watch it in the order that was intended:

1. Pilot
2. A Tree Grows in Trinity
3. Eye of the Beholder
4. Damned if You Don't
5. Potato Boy
6. Dead to the World
7. Meet the Beetles
8. Strong Arm of the Law
9. To Hell and Back
10. The Beast Within
11. Rebirth
12. Ring of Fire
13. Resurrector
14. Inhumanitas
15. The Plague Sower
16. Doctor Death Takes a Holiday
17. Learning to Crawl
18. Echo of Your Last Goodbye
19. Strangler
20. Triangle
21. The Buck Stops Here
22. Requiem

My favorite episode is ""Meet The Beetles,"" guest starring Sam Raimi favorite, Bruce Campbell. What strikes me most about this whole collection is how good the actors were (Lucas Black as the young Caleb Temple is a standout), and it's not surprising that several of the cast members have graduated to other great television and movie roles.

It would have been nice to have more episode commentaries, especially on the 4 episodes that were never shown on television. But given that the commentary on the pilot episode was uneven and sporadic (although I can understand Shaun Cassidy wanting to watch his creation after 10 years, rather than comment on it), perhaps the one commentary is enough.

I haven't had any problems with sound or picture (yet), and watching the entire series was a pleasure ... besides arriving in time for Halloween, I got to find out how the series ended. And yes, the creators did have enough time to bring the show to a conclusion, although they do leave it somewhat open-eneded.  The phrase ""the illusion of free will ..."" hangs over the final episode, although the way it ends isn't the cliff-hanger it could have been. In the end, it's all about the choices that we make, as Sheriff Buck hints at throughout the series.

Bottom Line: 4 stars for the show (definitely worth checking out)
2 stars for the idiots who ""prepared"" the episodes",1224115200,3,2341,4.533175355450237
2393523,3,B000ATQYXI,"I am only giving this DVD release three stars due to the whole thing being played out of order of the story line.  I thought the acting was good.  You can't go wrong with Gary Cole.  However, would it have killed them to put the episodes in the correct order on the DVD release.  Joss Whedon made sure the same was done for Serenity...would it have killed em to do it?  By the time I made it to Requiem I had gone online and read that the DVD was being shown in TV airing order and not in the order that told the story...I think that had a lot to with the show getting cancelled the way it did.  I did not even want to watch the last three episodes that were on the disc...I was like, ""eh...well I know how it all works out, so whats the point.""

2393525,4,B000ATQYXI,"This show is like putting Twin Peaks, the Stand, Picket Fences and Omen in a blender. Each episode is almost a story in it's own. The evil Sheriff Lucas Buck (Gary Cole) is evil incarnate, while his bastard son Caleb Temple (Lucas Black of Sling Blade) has to choose between him and his murdered sister Merilyn (Sarah Paulson), a ghost of good or a angel. It is the story of the struggle of good and evil within all of us, and it also shows that not everything is completely black or white, yet there is individuals more evil than good and vice versa, but even the bad have a little good in them. The show deals in folklore, myth, the supernatural, and it is very dark. Most people will not like this show as evidenced by it's cancellation. To many the last episode will be a major let down, no resolution but that wasn't the creator of the shows fault, it was the network CBS that canceled it not only that, when it was shown on TV it was constantly shuffled around and shown out of order with episodes that weren't even aired that even confused me as a viewer. They had plans to do another season that is why it seems there is no closure, one can only imagine what could've happened as endless fan fiction web sites have shown. There is commentary from the show's creator which is a bit lack luster and the episodes are out of order like on TV. The show seemed to come on at a time that Twin Peaks was going out on a low ebb but still influential and X Files the bastard child of the just mentioned show was on the rise, it seemed they tried to capitalize on the ""weird show"" craze. In my opinion they did a pretty good job of it, but they let the show die too early of a death and were very unfair in the way the treated it, it was as if they wanted the show too die. Too many networks back then and now let shows die instead of trying to find it a audience and let it grow, one season is not enough. If you like the otherworldly and weird this show is right up your alley but if your like the majority of Americans, this show will not appeal to you, you have to have imagination which most people lack. Aside from a ill advised character change out I think was out of their control, this show is a keeper and like Carnivale it makes you wish they had done more and if the show had been allowed to grow what potential it would've reached. Highly recommended for the imaginative, not recommended for the squeamish or happy ending Disney set.",1212969600,3,2443,4.211087420042644

It wasn't long before I started watching it because *I* enjoyed it, and I became addicted to the series.

The only thing I didn't like about it was the last episode.  The plot seemed rushed (and the end scene, with the battle between Caleb and Sheriff Buck seemed a bit hokey).  As others have pointed out, this was because the show was canceled, and the writers needed to quickly tie up the loose ends.

2393539,4,B000ATQYXI,"Where do I start? I remember this Shaun Cassidy driven drama from the mid-90's, and was glad to get it last year to finally see what happened in Trinity, S.C.. Well, as mentioned by many, the order of the episodes made it a nearly impossible to keep it straight. I was smart enough to go online and copy the correct order. I was at the point of not knowing which episode was next, which side of the disk was the episode on (front or back) and so on. I made a point to always be right in front of the DVD player because I knew I had to struggle with the mess Universal gave us fans. Onto the show itself, was a great spooky drama! Gary Cole is maginifcent as Sheriff Buck - "" that's Buck ... with a B"". The writers gave him excellent material to spin in his own sinister way. The rest of the cast is stellar as well. I will admit towards the middle of the series I thought it was getting a little ""long in the tooth,"" but the next episode I'd watch would draw me back in. The main characters, towns people and visitors of Trinity kept me intersted in the evil Sheriff Buck had controlled for years. Shows like this are rare, and to be reviewing this over 10 years after its release states that. Well written, acted and directed, American Gothic was a great show that CBS gave up on. Of course then Universal slaughtered it with it's inept sequencing and packaging. Buy this if you don't own it. I also loved the Hardy Boys reference toward the end of the series. Take the time (it took me a couple of months) to really analyze each episode and ENJOY. Gotta' go - there's ""someone at the door!""",1203033600,2,1592,4.222950819672131

2393563,3,B000ATQYXI,"Someone has started a petition to get Universal to make a NEW Special Edition dvd set for ""American Gothic"".

[...]

Shaun Cassidy's TV series ""American Gothic"" was released on dvd in October, 2005. The ""Complete Series"" dvd box set was anxiously purchased by fans who had been waiting 10 years since the show first aired.

While fans were grateful to have this set, there were some complaints. The episodes were double-sided and not of the greatest quality. The episodes were put on out of the intended order making it confusing for new fans to really know what was going on, and making it over-all a pain to have to keep switching discs/sides to see them in the proper order.

While it DID include some deleted/extended scenes, and a commentary with Shaun Cassidy and David Eick for the Pilot episode, that is hardly enough to satisfy true AG fans! We need more!

Please take a moment to sign this petition to tell Universal to make a new ""Special Edition"" set and to get it right this time!
The petition will run until January 24th, 2008.",1185580800,5,1041,4.635869565217392

2393567,3,B000ATQYXI,"This was a brilliant, dark, and disturbing series.  While as a fan I was very disappointed this show only lasted one season.  From an objective perspective I'm surprised it actually ever saw the light of day at all, on CBS no less.  That to me shows just good this controversial show was. Gary Cole as always was fantastic as the malevolent Sheriff Lucas Buck.  I expect no less from him.  The surprise to me was the acting of a young Lucas Black.  He brought a depth and range to character Caleb Temple.  He could ably portray Caleb as just a normal kid, enjoying the activities any 10 year old would enjoy.  Also the intense melancholy to a boy that has so much inner pain and turmoil for the loss of sister Merlyn.  When young Lucas Black has to act dark, he becomes one scary young lad.  I wonder why he hasn't had more prominent acting roles nowadays.  It is not often I am impressed with child actors, but his performance really left a mark on me, even a decade later.  This was one of my all time favorite TV shows.
So why only three stars for a five star series?  Well as others have stated DVD compilation was horribly mishandled.  What with the episodes out of order.  The source material wasn't remastered in anyway.  That is unforgivable in this high def world we now live in.  Also double-sided discs are the worst.  I had no problems with any kind of skipping or freezing, as is commonplace with some double-sided DVDs.  But it shows to me how Universal cut costs any way they could in bringing this series to DVD.
Do not let those drawbacks dissuade you from checking out a groundbreaking, excellent series.  If you, the potential customer, can look past these flaws, I guarantee you this will be a show that will stick in your mind long after you are done viewing.",1182470400,3,1780,4.452012383900929

2393569,5,B000ATQYXI,"Fantastic cast, from Gary Cole to Lucas Black & everyone in between. Too bad Shawn Cassidy didn't pitch this series to HBO instead of the networks, it might have actually gotten its run for the money. The series was moved around, episodes shown out of order, sometimes pre-empted for weeks at a time, even the loyalist of fans had trouble finding it from week to week (especially since it aired back in those pre-Tivo days). It's also sad that when it finally made it to DVD they did the same hatchet job on the episode order as the network did when it first ran the series. Thanks to everyone out there who gave us lists showing the correct order to view the episodes even if it does mean going from disk to disk/side to side just to see them in the correct sequence. As for quality, the picture is sometimes grainy & the scene endings where commercial breaks were to be inserted are painfully obvious, but  having said all that, and even though you can catch it right now on the Chiller network if you have DirecTV like we do, it was fun to do a weekend marathon of the entire series in the correct episode order & without commercial interuptions.

For me it was well worth the buy but of course the series ended too soon and you're left wanting more, after all, the battle for Caleb's soul was just getting interesting.",1179014400,6,1322,4.436213991769547

2393573,5,B000ATQYXI,"`American Gothic', a TV series, is a supernatural drama consisting of 22 episodes, some of which where not aired during the original run. It ran on CBS for one year between 1995 and 1996. Its creator Sam Raimi had already worked on southern horror projects such as `Evil Dead I & II' and would later go on to direct the southern horror thriller `The Gift' before breaking box office records with his `Spider-man' series success. Southern horror is nothing new as Stephen King attests using some of his best works as an example, such as `The Stand'. We also have the `Children of the Corn' series (nobody said all southern horror was great), the works of David Lynch and `Frailty' to name a few of what is a whole DVD section unto itself. Apart from the modern `Carnivale' TV series it is hard to find southern horror outside of some `X Files' or `Twilight Zone' episodes. The most obvious parallel though is to Lynch and `Twin Peaks', and for those who enjoyed Peaks, then Gothic offers a slightly less satisfying but equally as interesting plot type.

Gothic is about the town of Trinity, Deep South southern Carolina, that is home to what seems to be the devil himself in the guise of Sheriff Lucas Buck, who in the view of his deputies has never done an honest days police work in his life. Buck is creating illegitimate sons in order to sire his successor. Caleb Temple, an orphan, finds himself caught between his murdered sister's ghost pleas for revenge while a plot is hatched by Buck to turn Caleb to the dark side. Caleb's cousin, Gail Emory and local doctor Matt Crower, are determined to ensure that Caleb doesn't fall into the clutches of Buck's psychopathic fatherly lessons. The scene is set for explosive tension between this world and the next.

American Gothic was aired out of the directors intended sequence by the instances of CBS who also refused to air some episodes.  The episodes ""Echo of Your Last Goodbye"" and ""Strangler"" where not aired. ""Potato Boy"" and ""Ring of Fire"" were aired out of sequence. This same inconsistent sequence is presented in the DVD box set. For this reason you need to know the intended viewing order before you watch the DVD. The intended viewing is - ""Pilot"", ""A Tree Grows in Trinity"", ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""Damned if You Don't"", ""Potato Boy"", ""Dead to the World"", ""Meet the Beetles"", ""Strong Arm of the Law"", ""To Hell and Back"", ""The Beast Within"", ""Rebirth"", ""Ring of Fire"", ""Resurrector"", ""Inhumanitas"", ""The Plague Sower"", ""Doctor Death Takes a Holiday"", ""Learning to Crawl"", ""Echo of Your Last Goodbye"", ""Strangler"", ""Triangle"", ""The Buck Stops Here"" and ""Requiem"".

Compared to Peaks, Gothic is far more supernatural and slowly burned its way to a specific cult following that didn't generate any ground breaking ratings. A second season of Gothic did not appear, however when other stations aired Gothic in its intended order the ratings improved. The DVD series is also very popular. There are many reasons to believe that Gothic could have been made for extra seasons (what produ$er would not?) as there are some loose ends, but that is not to say that American Gothic does not stand alone as this mini-series, it does and it can. The only real onion is that one of the leads Dr. Crow (Jake Weber) left the show, or was written out, only a few episodes from the end. Apart from these minor production drawbacks American Gothic builds slowly but gains a lot of momentum towards the concluding episodes for a mind-blowing supernatural Abrahamic type finale on a staircase. If you like a good supernatural TV series and if you like originality with some of the best wit ever scripted and some serious dead pan sarcasm every split second, then look no further. And for those who boil at `CBS butchery' they can now own all of the Gothic episodes and watch it in the order it was meant to be viewed.",1170979200,13,3858,4.728083209509658

2393576,3,B000ATQYXI,"I remember watching this show when it aired 10 years ago and thinking it was thoughtfully creepy and suspenseful.  After watching the DVDs, I realized that the show is quite dated by today's standards.  The show relies on a lot of quick camera cuts and skewed camera angles for scare effects.  The special effects look very fake, and some of the sound effects and music transitions are too distracting.  The show improves in those areas as the season progresses, but there is still an emphasis on characters turning around and being surprised by another character who was not there with them before.  There is excellent acting from Gary Cole and Lucas Black, who play Sherrif Buck and Caleb Temple respectively, but most of the characters within the show have inconsistent character development.

As far as the DVD set itself, some of the episode descriptions written on the boxes are incorrect; they use the wrong character's name.  They are dual-sided discs, which gave me a couple of playback problems.  And most importantly, the episodes order is very off (an actor will leave the show and yet appear in the following episode).  Be sure to have the correct order when you watch the show.",1168214400,8,1191,4.856435643564357

He's great, and the stories were eerie and creepy, but I felt the show lacked suspense. To me, it needed a strong character to oppose Cole's Satanic sheriff. Watching him get his way each week got boring and predictable with no one trying to thwart him.

For those who have never seen this series, it's about a small town in the South called Trinity, where every resident lives by the law of Sheriff Buck, who asks for favors from all of the residents ( and they owe him, as long ago Buck did a 'favor' for them, so they are kind of forced to, unless they want to die...). Caleb Temple and his sister Merlyn ( who was killed by Buck) attempt to do good as Buck tries his best to sway them and get custody of Caleb (SPOILER: He's his real father).

2393605,5,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic is a well made thiller that will keep you locked to the TV until the last episode.  The characters and storyline keeps you interested and spellbound.

The main character, Sheriff Lucas Buck, does things that will make your skin crawl.  He can be very charming while seducing you into evil.  Gary Cole is an incredible actor, making this character all TOO real.  I love the scenes between Sheriff Lucas Buck and Ben, his deputy (played very well by Nick Searcy). Overall, the acting is great.  Every character comes to life. Even those that come back from death-like the Boston Strangler.

The tone of this show is also well done.  Even with the dark turn throughout each episode, the lighting, scenery and sound often gives an air of lightness. An example of this is in the pilot when Sheriff Buck is walking back to the jail cells, whistling the theme of ""The Andy Griffith Show"".

I loved this show when it first aired and I am pleased to have it in my collection.  It can be very addicting and you will not want it to end. Watching this series disturbed me at times but I wouldn't want it any other way.  The last two episodes, ""The Buck Stops Here"" and ""Requem"" will keep you on the edge of your seats.

Buying this DVD set is worth the price. My only complaint would be the disorder of the episodes-it would have been nice to have the unaired episodes placed in order.  Other than that, it is a great series to own.",1155686400,8,1436,4.4559386973180075

Especially Lucas Buck.  Now there's an interesting villain!  He almost reminds me of a Randal Flaggish villain though.  But those are the types of bad guys who are the most interesting.  And Buck certainly delivers!  I only wish this series had aired longer than a mere 22 episodes.  The series has such a dark ending and it would have been nice if more closure had come to pass.  Maybe I can find some fanfics or something to satisfy me.  But I think this series is fantastic nonetheless.

(Stop reading here if you don't want some plotpoints spoiled for you)  I wish Lucas Buck had finally gotten what was coming to him, though.  To end the series with Caleb's sister seemingly destroyed and with Caleb seemingly in Buck's care?  How depressing!  But I still enjoyed every episode, though.  I just wish more had been produced.

2393608,5,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic is a superb series for the myriad reasons given by the other reviewers (Gary Cole in particular is perfect in  the role of the sinister Sheriff Lucas Buck).

For those American viewers who have a multi-region capable DVD player, I'd strongly recommend getting the UK release (region 2) of the series instead of the American release (assuming you don't mind paying almost twice as much for it). Although the UK release has the same incorrect episode order as the American release, it consists of 6 single sided discs instead of 3 double sided discs (which avoids many of those scratch problems, and all that ""which side of the disc"" confusion, although you'll still have a lot of disc changing to do if you want to watch the series in order). Just search for ""American Gothic"" on amazon.co.uk instead of amazon.com.

If you want the correct episode order (which has been mentioned in a few other reviews) you can find it on the Wikipedia article for the series (just Google for ""American Gothic TV Series Wikipedia"" without the quotes and you should find it at the top of the list).

Overall: 5 stars for the *content* of the series, but Universal deserve a good kick for making such a mess of the DVD release.",1154217600,8,1225,4.683720930232558

He is so seductively sexy while being insanely sinister AT THE SAME TIME! Selina was awesome in this role also, but I have not seen her since. This show show was far beyond its time when it aired on CBS and was cancelled way too soon (WHY??!!).

Everyone in Trinity owes Lucas Buck (Gary) a favor and when it is time to pay up, boy... do you pay!!!!  His son Caleb (Lucas Black) who will either be like his father (the devil incarnate) or his mother - the classic story of good battling to overcome evil - exhibits superior acting skills in this series.  Who am I kidding, the entire cast was great and complemented each other well.

I would have given this DVD 10 starts, but again, the series is COMPLETELY out of order and that is no way to watch this intelligently witty show. And like other reviewers have stated, it is two-sided.  Imagine trying to watch the show in order, watching a episode, then having to get another disk watch an episode, then having to turn that disk over to continue watching the show in order, then having to get another disk, etc... you get the picture!!! Then why doesn't Universal???!!  I haven't had any skipping issues like other commenters, however. My set plays fine.

Overall, this is a great collection to have, just annoying to watch!! The deleted scenes are great to watch, but the quality of them are AWFUL.

2393613,3,B000ATQYXI,"I have to agree with several other reviewers regarding the quality of the DVDs (stalling or stuttering during first-time play) and the efforts made to present this series appropriately.  The most confusing part is the episode order, which was done based on when the episode aired but not in what order the episode was written.  This is extremely unhelpful to anyone not highly familiar with the series.  While many episodes can stand on their own there is also a continuing storyline with the major characters which requires proper viewing order to be understood.

It's a real shame as I have been waiting 10 years to see this series again as well as finally see the never aired episodes.  The deleted scenes rarely add anything to the episode that wasn't already there (in some cases adding only a few lines of dialogue) , and the commentary is unfortunately not a great addition either.  Co-producers Cassidy and Eick view the pilot for the first time since it was done and Cassidy spends most of it telling Eick to be quiet so he can watch the show.  It's a pity Eick wasn't doing it alone as he goes into more detail about locations, CGI use, wardrobe choices, network interference in the show, and casting choices but is constantly interrupted.

Given the time it has taken to bring this to DVD, it may be worth taking a chance on this purchase (and make note above of the proper viewing order).  It's an interesting series with some fascinating characters and some really stellar episodes.  It's a shame we never got to spend more time with them.",1151452800,3,1552,4.693726937269373
2393614,4,B000ATQYXI,"Shaun Cassidy, former star of the Hardy Boys and singer of such pop hits as ""Da Doo Run Run"" and ""That's Rock And Roll"" grows up to be a writer/producer. He overcame the critics of the 70s who tried to pass him off as a clone of his brother, David and carved a niche of his own in the pop world, rather successfully, I may add. Unfortunately, though through no fault of his own, Shaun has never had a bonafide hit in the television field with his written masterpieces. American Gothic was one of these gems. Invasion was the most recent casualty of a network's mishandling of the sci-fi or horror fantasy genre.

American Gothic was the tale of Trinity, South Carolina and its strange happenings. Run by Sheriff Lucas Buck (Gary Cole), the Devil incarnate, it is the tale of his coming to terms with his illegitimate son, Caleb Temple (Lucas Black) whom he wants to follow in his footsteps with the interference of returning prodigal cousin, reporter Gail Emory (Rescue Me's Paige Turco) and the town doctor Matt Crower (Medium's Jake Weber)as well as the supernatural influence of Caleb's dead sister, Merlyn. Produced by Shaun Cassidy and Evil Dead's Sam Raimi, American Gothic is a veritable classic tale of good vs. evil it's release marking it's 10th anniversary of broadcast including all 22 episodes, four of which were only broadcast on the Sci-Fi network. Trinity is a town, once visited, you will never forget....a town where there are skeletons in every closet. Sad to say, but Universal screwed up the true order of the episodes, but they are all here, and as one great reviewer here noted already, the true order as they should be viewed. This is the only thing that prevents me from giving this great set the five stars the package richly deserves.",1150416000,5,1762,4.720779220779221

To keep it simple, like many of the above reviews, love the series to death, think Buck is the sexiest man ever - (what is with evil men huh!) but we have found  the skipping, the lack of chronological order and the bizarre scratches completely annoying. We live in Australia and so the idea of waiting another five weeks to receive more Dual layered discs that may have the same issues (as the other reviews suggest) was certainly not an option - particularly when like most, we have all waited nearly ten years for this.

I adored this series when it was aired on British TV.  I think we were luckier than the American audience in that the shows were shown on a regular slot & I think we saw more episodes & in a more rational order.

Most of the episodes are fabulous - mixing black humour, steamy romance, gory murders & creepy sub-plots.  Gary Cole is gorgeous & his relationship with the incredibly sexy Selina is just great.

We seem to be luckier in the UK with the quality of the DVDs too.  I've read the reviews & see you've had lots of problems.  It is now released on 6 DVDs & mine only froze once.  The episodes are still not in order & I wish I'd seen this site before watching, as some people have very helpfully written out the correct order for us.

It's been a long 10 years wait.  I have some episodes on Video, but they have frequent commercial breaks & I have partially recorded over some.

Fabulous series, sadly cut short.  I don't agree with some reviewers regarding the ending.  I think it was rounded off a little, but without a completely satisfactory resolution & we never really found it who Buck is supposed to represent.  He is not powerful enough to be the Devil, as some people have suggested he is meant to be.

The twist is this. Sheriff Lucas Buck runs the town with an iron fist. He can make you or break you, literally. He is admired and/or feared by all. All except Caleb, that is. For Caleb, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, but one still needs to prove their worth to him. The most amazing thing about this show is the high level of courtesy all the characters show one another, after the initial tragedy sets the stage.

The show could be called ""Sympathy for the Devil"" or simply ""Trinity"" but the syndicated title says it best. It's a cult classic, with unstoppable twists and turns that make you want to watch it and only it until you've seen every episode.",1140652800,7,740,4.474074074074074

2393638,3,B000ATQYXI,"I had attempted to follow this series when it was on broadcast TV during the 1996-1997 season.  For some reason the network chose to remove it during early 1997, then show about four episodes during the summer of 1997.

This CD set contains all 22 of the completed episodes.  Unfortunately they are not presented chronologically in such a way that the viewer can watch the story unfold from start to finish.  As an example, the original doctor is confined to an asylum but is in one episode about four episodes later, then the other doctor is in the next one. This is just one example.

As far as the series itself, I feel the creators had a good idea, but did not know what to do with it.  You are never quite sure if Sheriff Buck is the devil, an channel for evil influences, or a devil's disciple.  Then, here's Gail (Paige Turco) believing Buck was responsible for her parents' death, yet sleeping with Buck.  These are just two of the most obvious descrepancies in the series.

The best thing about the series is Gary Cole as Sheriff Buck.  As a person who has followed the career of this most versitile of actors, I feel he deserves better star status.  I have yet to see an actor who is both convincing as the hero of a story and who is able to project the evil he did as Sheriff Buck.",1138752000,7,1292,4.341666666666667
2393649,3,B000ATQYXI,"This show isn't for everyone.  It takes place in a small southern town with all the pros and cons that tiny southern towns have.  The plots are often more subtle (though there are definitely exceptions) than the average viewer would like in their T.V. these days.  The southern accents can get annoying, and the sometimes bizarre cuts of Sam Raimi and his chosen directors are likely to throw off the average viewer.  There's a reason the show's a 'cult classic'.

That being said, as I've been watching these DVD's over the past week, it's remarkable how incredibly subtle and entertaining the morality plays are in this series.  The show is, for lack of better terminology, the tale of a demon (or devil) taken human form as a sheriff in a small town named Lucas Buck.  The sheriff bore a child named Caleb, and in the premiere, that child's parents and sister die when he's around age 8.

  From that point on, the entire show becomes a struggle ensues between the child's cousin Gail, and favorite doctor Matt, versus Sheriff Buck for the child's very future.  While Lucas attempts to subtly influence the child's decisions towards selfishness, pride, and victory at *all* costs, Gail and Matt try to show him that there are other ways to win, and all the while, the ghost of Caleb's sister works behind the scenes subtly coaxing Caleb to shun the quick and easy path for the somewhat tougher road of honesty and compassion.  While the plots of each episode often lack a subtlety (Lucas's manipulation of events and people was rarely subtle in the short run, while his larger goals were always getting closer in the process), the actual events of each episode are only a means to what Lucas wishes to be Caleb's end: individual lessons on a long and spanning road of what he hopes will alter Caleb's entire way of thinking.  And that long view is what makes the show so special and interesting, though certain episodes were certainly not well-thought-out nor well written, you could see how each one mounted Lucas's defense for a life of power and seflishness.

The series only lasted a paltry season, but the writers were apparently given a heads up, because there is a definite resolution of a sort to the show before it ends, so you don't have to worry about being disappointed by a lack of an end.

Taken in the long view, the show is remarkable in it's subtlety and intrigue, despite certain poor episodes.  That being said, something in the episodes is lost because CBS and Universal ignored the creator's demands that certain episodes air in a certain order, and the DVD collection is no exception there.  There is a preferred viewing order written by Sam Raimi that you can find on the web if you look, but it's very disruptive to switch DVD's and switch sides constantly to get to it.

If you buy this, buy it knowing it'll be a little troublesome to watch, but that subtle morality plays in today's TV and Cinema are becoming harder and harder to find.  If you can overlook the southernness of it all and the strange camera tricks, this is a tale worth weaving - and watching.",1137283200,7,3090,4.647058823529412

2393651,5,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic was a great and innovative series that was never given the chance to develop by the suits of CBS. Which was a real shame because this show had so much potential. While the show was filmed in Wilmington,NC. The story itself takes place in South Carolina in a small town known as Trinity. Gary Cole gives us his best performance to date as he plays the devilish but handsome Sheriff Lucas Buck who seems to have supernatural or occult type powers in which he uses to keep control of the people of Trinity. Lucas Black stars as Caleb Temple who is Lucas Buck's
illegitimate son who seems to have powers of his own.
Sarah Paulson stars as Merlyn Temple Caleb's deceased sister who returns as ghost or Gothic type avenging angel. Paige Turco stars as Gail Emory Caleb's cousin who comes to Trinity to help Caleb and catches the attention of Sheriff Buck and eventually falls under his charm. Also rounding out the cast is Jake Weber as Dr. Matt Crower, Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs, Nick Searcy as Ben Healy and John Mese as Dr. Billy Peele.

American Gothic only lasted for one season but developed a huge fan base that to this day is still seems to grow. Fans wanted more and now 10 years later the entire season was released on DVD. The DVD Set included all uncut 22 episodes, four of which were never shown in the USA or Canada, 15 Deleted or Extended Scenes, and commentary by series creator Shaun Cassidy.

Even now with the release of the DVD Set fans of American Gothic still yearn for more and still hold out hope that one day they will get to return to Trinity in a movie or a series resurrection.

Are the last four episodes (the unaired episodes) out of order? They sure seem to be. Does anyone know why this show was cancelled? Thanks.

PS: I live in Washington now, not Arizona. How do I change that on my amazon.com account? :)

2. Manufacturer and model number of your player.
3. Chapter and time code where the defect occurs.
4. Your shipping address (not P.O. Box; U.S. and U.S. Territories).

6. Daytime telephone number.
7. A copy of your receipt for original purchase.

2393654,1,B000ATQYXI,"Just one more person chiming in here that I have gone through many of these sets, so I did my share of having defective sets returned back to Universal.  I had two defective sets thru Amazon, then Amazon said this problem is widespread, that they will not replace another set but will just refund me, which they did.  Then I went through Best Buy and bought two more sets.  Best Buy is not supposed to refund but replace, but after two bad sets, I went up the ranks of management until one agreed to give me a full cash refund.  She agreed that this must be a bad batch and was understanding.  Even the people I spoke to before her at least offered a store credit, which would be good too, and you can buy working DVDs put out by another company.  As another poster said, I agree that we should demand our money back and let Univeral feel the hurt in their bank books.  Yes, I appreciate that this show was even released at all.  It is a brilliant show with brilliant acting, yet a very unknown show, so I was thrilled to see it would be released.  You can't find a bigger fan than me of this show.  But these defective skipping and freezing discs are a total insult.  It makes me sick that Universal, as people have posted, continuously has this problem yet continues to take our money for poor product.  I think it's a good idea for us to post a complaint to the Better Business Bureau about Universal, and I will do so online as soon as I post this review.  It's sad that every review here states how much they loved the show, yet most complain about this defective release.  If we complain, maybe there's a chance Universal will shape up.  At least demand your money back after viewing your defective disks...

I also recommend buying this set, viewing it the best you can (to at least be able to see this great show), and then return it for your cash.  That way you can see it (annoying as it can get with the freezing up in certain episodes), and also when it's returned due to being defective, Universal will get one more set returned back to them.  Why should defective product be out there?  And if you're truly lucky, maybe you'll happen upon a good set.",1135814400,25,2164,4.325062034739454
2393655,3,B000ATQYXI,"I agree with nearly all other reviewers: American Gothic is brilliant. I remember when the show debuted on TV. I was hooked from the first few episodes. But then I lost track of it (now I know why -- the network kept switching the airing days). So I was very pleased to see that it was released on DVD.

My wife and I recently bought and watched the entire set within a couple of week's time -- but only after taking it back to the store twice because of faulty discs. These double sided DVDs are crap. They skip, freeze and have a habit of getting stuck at the most inopportune times. We're now on our third set. So far, so good. It skips less, but still isn't skip-free.

Universal ought to be charged with some kind of crime for releasing such defective merchandise. Shouldn't we be contacting the Better Business Bureau about this? Shouldn't everyone who bought (and re-bought and re-bought) this DVD set lodge complaints against Universal?

Moreover, shouldn't we as consumers stop buying anything released by Universal no matter what it is? If Amazon gets the idea that no one will buy Universal products from them maybe they'll demand higher quality before placing massive orders. That would definitely hit Universal where it hurts: in the pocketbook.

Ultimately, it's not Universal's fault that they release crap. It's ours. We buy it, regardless. Amazon sells it, regardless. If Amazon and all of the consumers stopped buying Universal's defective garbage, they'd have to change its quality to be able to sell it. It's that simple.

The only consolation I can take in all of this is that Universal must have received a flood of returns from all over the U.S. Serves them right.

That said, I have to comment on the show itself. The acting is fantastic. The dialog is witty, often wry. Always very crisp. Although Gary Cole has gone on to bigger and better things in his career, I still like him best as Sheriff Lucas Buck. In this role, he is sublime.

American Gothic is a very strange slice of television. It's spooky, quirky, funny and completely engrossing. Others have described the show in greater detail. I'll let you read their reviews to discover what the show is about.

Even though I love the show, I hesitate to recommend the DVDs. If you do buy them, be prepared to return them endlessly until you chance upon a set that works.

Let's start an anti-Unversal campaign to get them to release better merchandise! (Incidentally, I had the same problems with Universal's Kolchak: The Night Stalker. Double-sided DVDs, like double-sided CDs, simply don't work.)",1135728000,16,2578,4.775280898876405
2393656,5,B000ATQYXI,"Let me make it clear that my rating is for the show ONLY.  I agree with others here that the dvd release is terrible - constantly having to switch disks to view the episodes in the correct order and having problems with skipping (although mine weren't as bad as others have had, but they were still annoying).  This was an excellent show and it should have been afforded a good dvd release.  The price for AG wasn't any less than for other one season releases, so Universal shouldn't have cut corners the way they did - that was a rip-off.  The show itself, however...  well, that's another story.  I'd have to say that of all the ""scary"" tv shows I've ever watched, this was the only one that actually scared me.  Most other such shows usually end up making me laugh because of their hokiness - not a problem with AG.  Plus, the combination of Paige Turco, Brenda Bakke and Sarah Paulson make Charlie's Angels look ugly.  This was an excellent, excellent show that shouldn't have been cancelled.  The one complaint about the show I would have (and it's also mentioned by the producers in their commentary) is that they had to rush the ending after they found out they weren't coming back the next year - not their fault, but I'm sure it would have been better if they had been given an earlier warning that they weren't being renewed.  Bottom line - great show, worth buying if you are willing to put up with the horrible dvd release.  Special thanks to those who posted the correct episode order in their reviews here.

2393657,2,B000ATQYXI,"Ten years ago CBS aired what would be the pilot for a terrifying new series called American Gothic.  The show starred Gary Cole as the sheriff of a small town called Trinity in South Carolina.  One might think, at first, this show is just a drama set in a small town but Sheriff Buck is more than meets the eye.  Soon, terrible things being happening.  What makes this show so intriguing is the mix of drama and horror.  The first time I heard ""Someone's at the door"" I was scared out of my mind.  This show was truly terrifying, but nonetheless intriguing.  Comparisons of this show could be made to the cancelled FOX series ""Point Pleasant"".  Both shows featured a teen who is the offspring of the devil.  Both shows were considered big gambles for their networks due to the supernatural nature of each series.  And both series were cancelled far too soon.
  Being such a fan of this show as I was when I was younger, I was thrilled when I heard it was being released on DVD.  I went to the video store the day it came out and immediately picked up my copy.  I loved the embossed, blood-red writing of the title.  The brown box was absolutely beautiful.  I had high hopes for the DVD set.
  My enthusiasm for the release quickly disappeared once I got home and popped this show in my DVD player....Not only were the episodes out of order so it was hard to follow the storyline unless I switched between disks, the episodes also skipped FREQUENTLY.  I would expect more in a DVD release for the price I paid.
  Universal truly saddened me with this set.  How can they expect to please their viewers if they put out sets such as this?  I have already contacted them and I would encourage anyone else who reads this and agrees with me to do the same.  If enough of us band together we should be able to get the quality DVDs we deserve.  As the saying goes, ""You get what you paid for"".  Well, I paid good money for this, I should get GOOD QUALITY.

***UPDATE***  I have contacted Universal Studios about these DVDs and they wrote me back apologizing for the sets but they have NO plans of putting out better quality sets at this time.  They have just agreed to issue another copy of the DVD-18s to anyone who sends in what they currently have.  My advice would be to bring your sets back to the store where you purchased it and demand your money back.  Show the people at Universal we will NOT stand for this kind of shotty craftsmanship and DESERVE GOOD QUALITY DVDS.

For one things its on double sided discs, which are always a bit ish, because they tend to scratch easily.

Now that all the bad points are out of the way, let me tell you why this boxset is still worth 5 stars, AMERICAN GOTHIC IS A WORK OF GENIUS! So good, in fact that I have been waiting 10 long years, for a copy on DVD.

The main reason to watch is of course, Sheriff Lucas Buck (played to perfection by Gary Cole).  He is sort of devil's representative on earth and his charm and razor sharp dark humour is brilliant and personally speaking, I think he's gorgeous.  Anyone who has already seen the show will have realised that the title of this review is a nod towards when he first meets Gail Emory and introduces himself as 'Sheriff Buck, with a B', so that she spells it right when she writes about him.

What is most enticing about the show, are the grey areas.  The Sheriff seems to only punish sinners, yet he is supposed to represent evil (could this mean that the town of 'Trinity' is hell) and the so called heavenly being (Caleb's dead sister, Merlyn) does some really awful stuff, which she says is 'in the name of God'. It turns out that it is for her own selfish reasons, which in my opinion makes her worse than Buck, at least with him it's 'what you see, is what you get'.  I think that it is maybe, the blurred boundaries and the fact that the wicked character was most appealing that got this show cancelled far too early.  Some viewers might not have grasped the point of the show, the fact that everything is not always black and white.

I could ramble on forever about the merits of this show, but I won't, since everything is always a matter of personal taste, I urge any fan of contempory gothic horror and good plots to BUY THIS SERIES AND TRY IT FOR YOURSELF. It is 'well worth the money', despite its bog standard packaging. DON'T BE PUT OFF!",1133827200,5,2215,4.471464019851116
2393672,5,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic is one of my favourite television series of all time.  Unfortunately, like others who have posted a review, the disks I received were in poor condition (skipping/freezing).  It is clear that Universal has thought so little of this series that they have put no effort into the packaging.

If you have never seen American Gothic it's definitely worth watching.  It was a very unique show that had some great acting from Gary Cole and Lucas Black.",1133740800,10,460,4.858974358974359
2393673,3,B000ATQYXI,"I had to knock a couple stars off because of the DVD skip/freeze problems, though it should have been knocked down to 1 star since this problem is so inexcusable with the good money we pay.  But the show itself is a definite 5 stars.  This show has haunted me for years, and I'm happy to see my teenage taste was great, and now with being ten years older, I enjoy the show even more.  I would say American Gothic would appeal to those 13+ years that have an interest in well-written, well-acted shows with eerie plots with the forces of good vs. evil (though sometimes I wondered if anyone in this show is 100% good or evil) especially because of the young boy Caleb.  But adults will benefit even more from the complexity of the characters, and the interesting dynamics.  Lucas Buck, the small town's evil and controlling sheriff, makes the show as great as it is.  I cannot imagine anyone matching Gary Cole's job.  He was amazing as the calm and collect yet evil sheriff whose ego occationally needed to be reminded who he was when someone didn't show him respect.  The main story thoughout the series was if Buck was ever going to get Caleb, who was really his son, to be on his side.  It is sickly unfortunate that such a great show was cancelled, but at least the final two episodes were made into a conclusion so we were left with a full story.  But believe me, I cannot help but wonder what would have become of the characters in this brilliant show that was way ahead of its time.

This show is so good that I'd be tempted to recommend it even to strangers in the street except for the fact that I cannot recommend people spend their money on a DVD set that is likely to be so flawed as this one with the dual-sided DVDs and all the skip/freeze problems.  Too bad for us fans, and too bad for the people who wanted to put this great show out there for us to enjoy, and even too bad for those who just wanted to make money off this.  Because we all lose with this poor release.  Oh, and on top of dual-sided DVDs that skip/freeze, the episodes aren't in order.  And because of all of these problems, I know not many other than the hardcore fan would have the patience to view this brilliant series.  But you will know from reading what this show is about if you will be one of the hardcore fans.  You know who you are who likes shows like this, so buy it and hopefully you'll get a good set-- but regardless, you'll love the show.",1133049600,17,2438,4.276688453159041
2393674,5,B000ATQYXI,"Shaun Cassidy has a hit series on his hands right now with the alien-thriller Invasion, but ten years ago it was a harder row to hoe with his demonically-inspired weekly show American Gothic. At the time, CBS didn't give the series its due - they not only dropped entire episodes out from the middle of the story-line without ever airing them, they often preempted the show for weeks on end. After slapping the viewers' faces time and time again, CBS found that fans turned their TV attentions elsewhere.

When it was airing, American Gothic was one of my favorite shows. And I've never quite forgotten it; it's one of those series like Twin Peaks or Carnivale - it's flawed but so compelling it haunts the memory for years. The story takes place in darkly wooded Trinity, South Carolina and centers on the imposing Sheriff Buck (Gary Cole) and his orphaned, (secret) illegitimate son, Caleb Temple (Lucas Black). The story-line is not especially unique but everything just gelled so perfectly with the actors and their characters, American Gothic qualifies as a classic.

But how does it hold up? Despite some rather dodgy special effects and the occasional heavy-handedness, American Gothic holds up very well. It's much bolder and far more addictive than Cassidy's current Invasion, as a matter of fact. Some of the greatest little signature touches about the show include the catchphrase, ""Someone's at the door""; or the way Sheriff Buck always just shows up out of the blue as if dropping from the sky (or maybe coming up from someplace else); and Caleb's ever-furrowed brow and the way he said ""Daay-dy"".

One of the best shows early on in the DVD is ""Meet the Beetles"" - it's a standalone episode and will remind many of an X-Files episode. The opener of the show is a bone-rattling bang when Caleb and his friend Boone are looking through the charred ruins of what was once Caleb's family home - a skeletal hand seemingly latches onto the boys' ankle and tries to pull him underground. Throughout the episode, Caleb is haunted by visions of his own grave.

It turns out the remains belong to Hack Weller and that, even though he's been reduced to bones, the philandering husband has been dead for only two or three days. Much to the pithy Sheriff Buck's consternation, the State Police send square-jawed Lt. Drey (Bruce Campbell) in to solve the mysterious and potentially deadly case. It's an episode that will keep on ""bugging"" you even after the final fade.

The actors would later go on to do other remarkable roles - Cole in Office Space; Black in Sling Blade; and Jake Weber in TV's Medium - but it's the genre-blending American Gothic that discerning horror fans will always remember them for.

The DVD features deleted scenes and commentary on pilot episode from Cassidy and producer David Eick. Cassidy admits he hasn't seen the series since it aired 10 years ago, and too often it shows - there are some rather unfortunate long lapses of silence as he watches the show. There are a very interesting tidbits revealed; for example, Cassidy reveals that the ""Someone's at the door"" scene sold the pilot as he acted it out for CBS execs.

The pair jokes about the prominent Elvis pillowcase shown in the pilot, and they complain about the stock music they were forced to resort to in certain sequences. They also mention wannabe Prez Bob Dole's then-ongoing anti-violence-on-TV campaign a few times, then they never utter a word about Dole during a scene in a which a certain character is found dead with an expensive writing instrument thrust into his windpipe (remember Dole's trademark pen?).

Eick and Cassidy also talk about how producer Sam Raimi came in with a lot of visual ideas, and how he gleefully said that yes, Buck is the Devil (while Eick and Cassidy say they wished to keep the Sheriff's identity more ambiguous - however, one of them does laughingly say during the commentary, ""This is not Touched By An Angel - it's Touched By Satan!"").

They don't go into too much detail about the show's cancellation, but Eick does say, ""We knew we were dead early enough to be able to plan our own funeral,"" in regards to being able to wrap up the loose ends in the series finale.

It's absolutely wonderful to the have the American Gothic series on DVD, finally. However - be warned that the order of the episodes is not sequential and that there is nothing on the DVD package to indicate this. The four unaired episodes are piled on the last disc, but actually the show should be viewed in this order:

Pilot

A Tree Grows in Trinity

Eye of the Beholder

Damned if You Don't

POTATO BOY

Dead to the World

Meet the Beetles

2393675,5,B000ATQYXI,"I have had some skipping problems like the other reviewers discussed, but I didn't let that distract me from the show!  I was a little worried that this show would seem dated after not seeing it for 10 years, but it wasn't at all except for the over-sized wireless phones people were using.  This show is similiar in some ways to Carnivale and I think if you like that show you will like this show.  I actually like this show better than Carnivale because it has a sense of humor and you actually care about the characters.  Also, the characters in this show just seem more 3 dimensional than the Carnivale characters with no one being purely good or purely evil.  Lucas Buck is likable villian, with a sense of humor and even a sense of justice, if somewhat twisted.  All of the acting is great and the show is well written.  It's very irritating that CBS didn't have the faith to keep this show on the air and now Universal didn't have the faith to put the show on quality dvds.  Still, you shouldn't let that stop you from enjoying this great show.",1132444800,8,1051,4.381443298969073
2393676,5,B000ATQYXI,"This is such a brilliant program! I was only 12 when this show first aired in Australia so I barely rememeber any details except how SCARED I was watching the few episodes I saw. So obviously now I'm all grown up I was dying to see it all again. I've watched half the season over the weekend and am totally hooked, Sheriff Buck is so creepy but sexy at the same time and Lucas Black's acting as the charactor of Caleb is amazing for his age. I've had no problem with the discs or packaging, no glitches at all on the DVD and the quality is fine in my opinion.

My only complaint is that the episodes have been put on the discs out of sequence in order to follow the intended story correctly. I found the correct episode listing online and watched them in the order meant by the writers, not the order of airing in the USA on CBS. Such a shame there was only one season.",1132099200,7,869,4.1420118343195265
2393677,1,B000ATQYXI,"I cannot believe the difficulties I'm having getting throught these cheaply manufactured DVDs! :o(

It starts with disc 1 side 2, and goes down hill from there. I just finished watching disc 2 side 1 and the skipping begins on the 3rd episode. Given the other complaints I see on here about this exact same issue, I'm really thinking this is going to be a losing proposition. It's really a shame as the series was excellent. And its not as if they're giving it away for free, so why did they go so cheap on the DVDs???

I now actually wish I could order this on VHS because at least then I would be able to SEE it all.

I'll give disc 2 side 2 a try tomorrow. If that proves frustrating, then I'm probably just going to return them for a refund.

:o(

Follow-up to my above review ... Nov 20, 5005:

I've given up. After attempting unsuccessfully to get through the rest of the DVDs this weekend, I'm returning the set for a refund. It's impossible to get through side B of any of the disks with the skipping, jumping back to the beginning and freezing.

How completely disappointing that Universal would use such cheap materials and still expect us to pay full price. I'm really sorry that I won't get to see the rest of the series. But this is way too aggravating.",1131667200,15,1266,4.338983050847458

You just have to tell your machinery that you're in Europe while you watch it.

----
I'm about to exchange my second copy of this set because it is unwatchable.  It doesn't just skip, it freezes--I actually had to turn my machine off to stop it at one point.  I've spent way too much time restarting the discs over and over--this is no way to watch a collection I've waited eagerly for 10 years to enjoy!  The first three episodes ran just fine; the problems start with the second side of the first disc and don't stop.  I'll keep exchanging till I get a copy that plays till I tell it to stop--that's not having high expectations, that's the very least I'm paying for.  It's too bad Amazon is stuck with all the shipping, but maybe they'll complain to Universal, which will carry more weight than my letter will.",1131667200,7,1046,4.38860103626943
2393689,5,B000ATQYXI,"First of all...this is good stuff. I loved it when it was on CBS....when it was on, not being interrupted or moved or pre-empted. I don't know how I found it, because it was poorly promoted, but I loved it.

For years, it has haunted me. I bought a bootleg copy of it, not realizing until I watched it what it was, (it actually was packaged much more professionally than this REAL release) and then, while reporting that, I heard about this release, at last!

What struck me the most, besides all the stuff that was ""left out"" when it was on air, was the deep appeal of the Gary Cole character. The key to this, in case anyone is wondering, is classic dominance. Buck is dominant, Selena is submissive (for the most part) and there is something primal about it that exceeds the bounds of good and evil. I didn't really recognise this 10 years ago. I do now...it is not an ordinary run-of-the-mill ""sexy"", it is something darker and wilder, folks!

..and so when I found out -sheerly by chance- that Cassidy's pen was behind Invasion, I tried to watch it. Sadly, the Bad Timing Witch seems to have put a spell on this one, too. Maybe I can catch it in re-runs or something.

Meanwhile, for classy TV horror, this ranks right up there with Stephen King's mini-series, The Shining. I am dreading all the horror involved in the DVD set itself...skipping, out of sequence, etc....but I am still wanting this. Give it a try. The Lucas/Selena/Caleb scene in the cabin alone is worth the price of admission!",1131408000,5,1499,4.520295202952029

I have returned my set hoping for the next one to operate better but with the discs actually using both sides it just doesn't look good. I actually went on line and complained to Universal. I would think for the price they could have delivered a quality set.",1131062400,8,480,4.454545454545454

However, I'm now on my fourth copy of the set. All the problems I've had have been with both sides of disc two, where it skips, freezes and jumps from chapter to chapter. I've not made it to the third disc yet as I keep having to exchange it with the hope that I'll find one that isn't trashed. I have high expectations of my media, be they books, CDs or DVDs, and such poor-quality craftsmanship is annoying in the extreme.

If you love the show as I do, go for it, but be warned that you may wind up having to send it back because of poor workmanship.",1131062400,9,771,4.133333333333334
2393692,4,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic was the victim of lousy timing. When it debuted on network TV in 1995, it arrived too late to ride on the coattails of Twin Peaks' success and too early to ride the wave of popularity of shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. It also faced fierce competition from The X-Files which ultimately won out sending American Gothic and the underrated X-Files wannabe Dark Skies into pre-mature cancellation.

Gothic was the brainchild of `70s pop icon Shaun Cassidy who was clearly influenced by David Lynch when he made this show as evident by the opening credits of small-town America accompanied by `50s era rock `n' roll music. However, as much as Cassidy is influenced by Lynch his show is also steeped in the rich tradition of southern gothic horror in the vein of William Faulkner's prose.

Like Lynch did with Twin Peaks, Cassidy explores the incestuous-like secrets that plague a small-town. In an amusing running joke, it seems that almost everyone owes Sheriff Buck a favour in what were probably some kinds of Faustian pacts. The show never spells out what these were but only presents them as little asides when Buck greets a passerby on his way to somewhere else.

When American Gothic aired the network had no idea how to market its funky blend of horror and magic realism and moved it around, showed episodes out of order and basically insured that no one but the dedicated few would stick with it. At the time people only wanted to see cop shows (NYPD Blue), sitcoms (Seinfeld) or medical shows (ER) and so it died an early death. But Cassidy has persisted and surfaced this year with a new genre show called Invasion, a modern take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It too focuses on a small-town filled with dark secrets. So far, this show has been a success so at least Cassidy's timing has improved.

Each disc features a variety of deleted and extended scenes for various episodes.

A real treat for fans is an audio commentary for the ""Pilot"" episode by Shaun Cassidy and producer David Eick. It's been ten years since they have seen this episode so it's a trip down memory lane for both of men. They point out all the cast who have since gone on to greater success and joke (sort of) about the troubles they had and the pressures imposed on them by the network who clearly did not understand what they were trying to do.",1130889600,5,2362,4.627684964200477

Lo and behold it came out on DVD just a few days ago and I was sooooooo happy.  I promptly bought the set here and plan to keep it forever in my library.  One of the DVD's skips the first 10 minutes but not enough to return it.  Yes it is alittle out of order but I could watch Lucas Buck ""That's Buck with a ""B"", Caleb, Merlie Ann, Ms. Coombs and Dr. Matt several dozen times without getting sick of it.  It is one of those shows that was ahead of it's time and should be resurrected somehow.  They also cancelled Brimstone which had the same intelligence, but hands down American Gothic is my favorite of all time.  I guess Dr. Matt is busy being Alison Dubois's husband on Medium which is another one of my #1 shows to watch.  Anyway, if you have never watched this show, buy it NOW, it will be worth every penny!

2393695,1,B000ATQYXI,"American Gothic is a terrific television series, canceled far too soon, and sadly mishandled by the CBS network during its run (episodes aired out of order, entire episodes unaired, etc). Now Universal has repeated CBS's mistakes with this DVD release. Sure, we should be happy to see American Gothic on DVD at *all*, but this series deserves far better.

Most offensive: the episodes on these discs are *completely* out of order. (Shouldn't the series finale be the last episode on the set? It's not. It's episode eighteen on the DVDs. Was anyone at Universal thinking when they put this set together?) American Gothic fans (Gothniks) contacted Universal prior to the release of these DVDs. They said: MAKE SURE YOU GET THE ORDER CORRECT. Universal didn't listen. Now, first time viewers of this brilliant series will likely be left *bewildered* instead of impressed.

Universal also continues to release their television programs on those absurd dual-sided DVD-18 discs, which are quite prone to damage. They easily scratch, then sputter and freeze-up. Compare Universal to Fox's releases of Angel, Millennium, etc. Fox does a far better job with the video/audio transfers, and they put the episodes on single-sided DVD-9 discs with nice artwork. (The American Gothic DVD box cover is UGLY too.) Universal can really take a lesson from companies like Fox and Shout Factory!. Good programs like American Gothic deserve better, *especially* when fans have waited so long to see their favorite programs hit DVD. Sheriff Buck would not tolerate this mess.

Unforutantely Universal have chosen to release the shows on 3 double sided DVD-18s. (think it of 2 dual layered DVDs stuck back to back). What this means is that DVDs have no ""printed side"" and therefore are more prone to damage when handled. In additon these types of Discs are far more likely to suffer from defects during the manufacturing process. Another problem is that the episodes have been ordered on the DVDs in the same order as they were broadcast....not so strange until you consider that this wasn't the directors intended order and therefore results in the continuing storyline not making a whole lot of sense. At least they got one thing right and there is a great audio commentry by Saun Cassidy on the Pilot episode.

American Gothic was absolutely one of the best dramas that's ever been on any television network, cable or broadcast.

What initially interested me was that I'm a big Gary Cole fan, but what I got was so much more.

It was a perfect combination of horror, the supernatural, a morality play, a romance, dark comedy and sometimes just a good old fashioned ""whodunit"" in the classic sense.

Cole pulled off the perfect antihero: a Sheriff you love to hate and is most likely the Devil incarnate, but who is sexy, funny, and  occasionally shows a glimmer of humanity;  Nick Searcy (The Fugitive, Nell) as the Devil's perfect Renfield, Lucas Black as the Innocent represetative of the Good battling the Evil; and the rest of the supporting cast falls into perfectly into line as characters who fill up this  small southern town with some pretty strange goings-on.

Excellently acted, perfectly filmed and great writing; if you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to invest the time in watching it.

You'll never again think ""Someone's at the Door"" the same way.",1127952000,6,1096,4.818181818181818

Perhaps this series was too revolutionary for its time, or perhaps the TV executives would rather stuff mindless dribble down our throats. Either way, it's unfortunate that this series only lasted one season.... But then again maybe that is what made it great. Buy it, watch it, love it. An easy 5 stars.

I would also recommend HBO's series Carnivale in addition to American Gothic.",1127865600,4,457,5.0131578947368425
2393725,5,B000ATQYXI,"this is one of the best shows ever, great character, great story.. overall very well handled.. everyone gets the chance to shine in it's first and only season..

the good news is even though there is only one season.. the story arc is complete and there is a great resolution...

if you missed it on TV.. you won't be dissapointed with this purchase.. and if you're an original fan.. a great one to re-live

Then a few years later the Sci Fi Channel started running all the episodes in chronological order and I finally got to see everything from the beginning. I became a Gary Cole fan then and there, and my obsession with this show continues to this day.  Yay! At last at last it's here!  I already have a night set aside to just sit and watch and enjoy, as I'm sure do all the other American Gothic fans.  There is a God....and the Devil too, and he's living in Trinity, South Carolina and goes by the name of Sheriff Buck...that's Buck with a ""B"".  Whoo hoo!!",1126656000,2,695,4.282442748091603
2393727,5,B000ATQYXI,"I am writing a pre-review, because although it's not available until November, I watched every episode that was aired, and know it doesn't get any better.  I agree with all the other reviews in that this was one of the most unique, chilling, sexy, and masterfully done series on TV, which was why it was not appreciated by the mainstream.  The character development was exceptional, and of course, Gary Cole as the sexy Sheriff/Satan was perfectly cast. I think it would be a cult hit if it were done again today. Maybe the ""suits"" will take note of the sale of this DVD and give it another season.  Although Gary Cole has another show (""Wanted""), this would appeal to today's market, and I would love to see a come-back.  This is what I love about Amazon.  I just thought of the show recently after seeing ""Wanted,"" but thought I'd never find this obscure series on DVD.  I put in a search, and there it is-the whole series in one package, reasonably priced, and free shipping.  I don't mind waiting, knowing it's available, and soon I'll be mesmerized watching it all over again.

THANK YOU AMAZON!

2393728,5,B000ATQYXI,"Hard to believe that Shaun Cassidy created this series.  It's dark, subtle, fascinating and exciting.  Gary Cole, who has NOT been one of my favorite actors, is absolutely brilliant as Sheriff Lucas Buck (who may or may not be human) and Brenda Bakke really steams up the screen as the sexy schoolteacher, Selina.  The rest of the cast is also great, especially the creepy Merlyn.  I am so happy to see this series coming out, finally.  Now, if the studios would only release Brisco County on DVD.",1126396800,4,497,4.666666666666667
2393729,4,B000ATQYXI,"Created by Shaun Cassidy with help from Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi, American Gothic was never given the time it needed to become something really special, but for those who followed the show upon it's premiere on CBS, it already was.  Taking place in the small South Carolina town of Trinity, American Gothic focuses around young Caleb (Lucas Black, who appeared opposite Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, and more recently in Friday Night Lights) who has a mysterious connection to the supernatural world and receives frequent visits from his dead sister Merlyn (Sarah Paulson).  The sheriff of Trinity, Lucas Buck (the teriffic Gary Cole) has set his sights on Caleb for his own reasons, as the viewer is shown how much control Buck has over the town and it's inhabitants.  Among the mix are a reporter (Paige Turco) and a doctor (Jake Weber) who are pawns in Buck's game, as the viewer is shown more and more that Buck may be either the most evil man walking the earth, or the devil himself.  Were it not for it's all too brief run, viewers could have seen that Buck is simply one of the most mesmerizing TV villains of all time, and the eerie settings and the great cast only make American Gothic all the sweeter.  It's not for everyone, and it's a unique show for a unique audience, but for fans of the series who were hoping for a DVD release, you can now rejoice.",1126310400,4,1366,4.559183673469388
2393730,5,B000ATQYXI,"Any time a TV series appeals to a higher intellect, you can bet it will be short-lived, thanks to the networks.  (i.e., Twin Peaks)  I'm glad they made this series available to us on DVD.  The writing was excellent, as was the acting.  The series title speaks for itself:  it's definitely American Gothic.

(One thing I have to add, however:  another reviewer confused the series creator, Shaun Cassidy, with his half-brother,David, and made the Partridge Family connection.  Shaun is definitely a heart-throb in his own right; but, as this series evidences, his talents expand beyond the pink satin pants he wore at his concerts, as well as his days as ""Joe"" on ""The Hardy Boys."")",1125792000,5,681,4.860869565217391
2393731,5,B000ATQYXI,"Hoorah!  I'm not sure why they list Rod Steiger (he had a film of the same title from 1988) as this series played in the mid 90's on CBS, then later on the Sci-fi channel and somewhere off in Great Britain.

Starred Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck, Paige Turco as Gail Emory, Jake Weber as Dr. Matt Crower, John Mese as Dr. Billy Peale, Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs, Lucas Black as Caleb Temple, Sarah Paulson as Merlyn Temple and Nick Searcy as Deputy Ben Healy.

Fans of Horror and Fantasy/Sci-Fi will love it. It's creepy but not gorey (hey, it was on CBS). Classic battle between good and evil, and the human souls in between. Despite the short life of the series, they manage to tell you a complete, well-written story.",1125273600,4,725,4.43609022556391

2393733,5,B000ATQYXI,"At LAST!  Sings its praises!  American Gothic was one of the trippiest, most unusual shows of the last 20 years, IMHO.  Gary Cole found the soul of that character and played it perfectly.  He was evil, funny, cruel and intelligent, sometimes all at once and never in a way you'd expect.

While some episodes are definitely better than others, the thread of the story is compelling and strongly rendered.  All the actors seemed to relish being part of it and their care shows.  It was by turns thought-provoking, captivating and utterly spooky.

Word is that they are trying to restart American Gothic and the entire cast (sadly, minus Lucas Black who is now too old to play Caleb) has agreed to return, if they get the green light.

BUY THIS COLLECTION.  If we show the studios how much people care about American Gothic, there is a chance we will be rewarded with more of this unique vision.",1124841600,8,892,4.624203821656051
2393734,1,B000ATQYXI,"What's worse-- to hope that one of your favorite shows will one day be on DVD and hold on to that hope, or to have that show on DVD, flawed discs that freeze and skip so badly you give up after multiple sets, get your money back and aren't even willing to own the show?

First off, my Sony DVD player has never had a DVD skip or freeze, and I get much use out of it, have played many different DVDs on it, but this series is the first and has been the last problem on my DVD player-- and my discs weren't even scratched (it's not our players-- this is just a bad DVD release).  I went through two sets through Amazon and got my money back, then went through two sets at best buy and was able to persuade a manager to give me my money back.  In the process of temporarily owning all these sets, I watched the entire series, though some episodes skipped so poorly it was hard to continue watching, and the final episode had the entire first half cut off because the skipping was so horrible.  This release is pathetic.  No excuse.  Great show I'd love to own, but not this pathetic release.  This show could have been a huge DVD hit like Firefly ended up to be, a big profit for the powers that put it out, but they won't see that success because even suckers like me aren't going to invest in this set.  It was tempting to hold onto a flawed set, but I am hoping another run will be released, and I'll be able to grab a good set (but my hope is low this will ever happen).  I'd glady pay twice this price for a decent set.  I can handle out of order episodes (pathetic as that is that they'd release it this way), but I can't stomach all the

freezing.

If you want some ideas for DVD sets to look into, look up Freaks and Geeks (far different genre, but well worth the money), The Shield (violent and intense, but I got so hooked), and Roswell (a fun series to watch).  Unfortunately I'd put American Gothic at the top of this list, but not with these insultingly flawed discs.",1124755200,9,1977,4.143979057591623
