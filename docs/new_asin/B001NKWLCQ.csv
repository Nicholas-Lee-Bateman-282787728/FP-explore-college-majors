3719631,5,B001NKWLCQ,The Easter Bunny put these in my son's Easter basket when he was four years old.  They were a huge hit.  He is now six and still watches them from time to time.  The stories are great and they really hold a childs interest.  I would not hesitate to recommend this series. (Watch out for duplication between some of the box sets available.),1330732800,,339,4.333333333333333
3719632,5,B001NKWLCQ,"I am very choosy about what my children (ages 9 and 2) watch on the television.  We don't subscribe to cable or satellite tv for that very reason.  However, this particular type of video programming is totally awesome!  These stories follow the books exactly as they are written, and my children know these stories word for word, so they would know if any artistic liberties had been taken.  After watching these videos, my children are inspired to act them out or read the story books again and again.  I find that very rewarding because, unlike other types of media, what they are acting out is wholesome and pure, child-appropriate behavior.  Also, there are quite a few stories on each dvd, so you're getting a good value.",1317340800,3,726,4.722222222222222
3719633,5,B001NKWLCQ,"My son received one of the individual dvds in this collection as a gift, and promptly cracked the disc trying to remove it the first time.  He was heartbroken, so I went looking for a replacement and found this treasury for a much better price than the original.  We love these stories, you cannot beat Scholastic.  And, This is such a nice ""boy"" collection.  They are very well done, in fact our preschool uses these dvds sometimes to reinforce the reading of the books.",1306281600,,471,4.571428571428571
3719634,5,B001NKWLCQ,"Very pleased, recv'd sooner than expected. Great variety of DVD storybook collection for any boy. Ours loves it, especially ""I Stink"" since he is in love w/ garbage trucks!",1305504000,,172,4.9655172413793105
3719635,5,B001NKWLCQ,"I purchased this DVD set fo my 3 year old.  I had purchased a Scholastic DVD for him in the past that he really liked so I decided to roll the dice & hoped he would like these too.  I have too say when I put the movies in and saw that they were read along and stories straight out of the 70's & 80's I -1) had a flashback to elementary school & -2) thought for sure my son would hate them!
I was surprised to see him so interested in the cheesey filmstrip like movie but he really likes them!! I guess there is something to be said about a good story!!",1293926400,2,552,3.8333333333333335
3719636,3,B001NKWLCQ,The movies are exact to the books that have been around forever. My son is only 2 but enjoys watching them.  They are short and just the right  duration for his attention span.  I am also a teacher and think that having books brought to life in this manner is ideal.,1293840000,2,266,4.176470588235294

8327341,5,B001NKWLCQ,"Always get your children Scholastic stories on dvd.  These are definitely talented often well known actors narrating the stories and the visuals are moving animated images designed from the original book illustrations.  I love them as and adult.  No boring long over the head plots from a 2 hour movie your child plays through part of or snooze through.  These stories are timely, found in hard copy too...which your chikd will be excited to read...quality visuals and storues...collect all...i found buying the larger collections was cost effecrive.  And we can exchange the collections between my 2 grand children's families.  Great night time viewing to wind down little minds.",1483315200,,680,5.25
8327342,4,B001NKWLCQ,"These are GREAT! ""Trashy Town"" ""Mike Mulligan..."" and all the dinosaur stories. Awesome. My only issue is there are some wonderful, well done stories mixed with some really poorly done and meh stories. You really have to pick and choose the movie you play. For example ""Trashy Town"" is AWESOME, following by a story about a doughnut that is not well done and a bit creepy. I would just be advised to pick and choose your stories from this wisely. Otherwise, a great scholastic pick.",1473379200,,482,4.682352941176471
