7028119,1,B00U2YNMLS,"I am reluctant to rate this because I only got through the first 15 minutes into it so if you can get through it, let me know and how you rated it. Good luck. If you choose to watch it. Nuff said.",1438905600,,196,3.6904761904761907
7028120,1,B00U2YNMLS,Started out slow and then picked up and got stupid after that.  Could follow here and there and the movie lost all contact with the beginning.,1438041600,2,142,4.461538461538462
7028121,3,B00U2YNMLS,"All Sinners Night has a pretty cool story concept that stumbles some hurtles as it attempts to complete a very complex story arc. With a mix of psychological thriller and extreme gore, the film brings out some strong subject matter as well as brain matter. The acting is hit-and-miss with the unfortunate miss coming from the main characters that are to drive the emotional connection to the victimized. Lines are delivered with awkwardness as the two actors stumble over heightened emotions to give us dialog. There is some nice character deliveries in this film, mostly from the victimizers who gives early Bressack style driven cruelty to their characters. An almost to real feel, which is awesome.

The scenes are staged in a nice, somewhat surreal, nightmare-obscura way that is also nice to see from Easleys cinematography, and his own guidance of course. There is a heavy, sinister atmosphere that really brings the horror to All Sinners Night. Unfortunately a lot of the acting is either over-kill, or muddled with bad line-delivery. Except from the afore mentioned cast members. The notable stand out is the twisted preacher man. He looks and feels as evil as any that can come from a horror setting such as this.

Now the special effects in All Sinners Night kicks some major ass on indie, low budget scale. The scenes and practical effects own this beast from start to finish. There is brutality that feels like real life crimes taking place, blood splatter and gore a plenty throughout the film. And it isn't that off screen suggestive stuff that most low budget films use, often successfully, but this is full frontal assault mayhem that shows the faith placed in the FX departments hands. The soundtrack and effects are a blend of punk rock, rock-a-billy, spook show stuff that keep the energy up for a lot of the film. Just know that the pesky flaws with the main characters acting kills a lot of the awesomeness that can be found in All Sinners Night.",1431216000,,1967,4.833827893175074
7028122,4,B00U2YNMLS,"This is a non stop edge of your seat terrifying ride into mayhem & terror, With plenty of good old fashion gore , I loved this film & would recommend to anyone, along the lines of something like a purge but much much better with a really cool satanic twist trust me you don't wanna let this one pass you by.",1429833600,,307,4.049180327868853
7028123,1,B00U2YNMLS,"The worst sound effects I have ever encountered in a movie. Not the best story, but not the worst. This movie would and could've been better with totally different actors, and a I do mean all of them. The sounds during all of the major scenes, particularly the murder scenes was terrible. Everything should have been better to make this a dvd worth buying, but it wasn't. I would like to give this movie one and a half star, but there is no way it deserves a two. Don't rent or buy this movie. Borrow a copy. The scenery was probably the best thing about this movie, but then I have the National Geographic Channel for that.",1429315200,,624,4.3418803418803416

Whatever guestar57 was on when they watched this steaming pile of stool, I want some of that! Acting is terrible, plot is subpar, and to top it of it looks like it was shot with an out of focus handy cam.",1426809600,,270,4.0
7028125,4,B00U2YNMLS,"Stars : Sammy Terry,John Dugan,Sal Lizard and Harry Levin.

A Bobby Easley flick.

So this is a terrifying flick made in Indiana USA ?

Great set-up with two surviving victims that have lost someone close to a cult,A bloody cult bent on taking 5 more victims in its wake on Halloween !

The two survivors witness and chronicle links to cult lead by a satanic pastor.

The cast is amazing and can act,The effects are gruesome and not off  handed additions to a wild ride of a horror film.

So, A great poster, Good acting which goes with a nice script and All Sinners Night is just a cool movie to watch.",1426464000,,603,4.330357142857143
8704152,1,B00U2YNMLS,"Unwatchable.  We started this movie with some hope, but it is a terrible failure.  The dialogue is totally middle-school, stringing one cliche after another, and the director seems to think that holding the camera four inches from the faces of his actors creates, I dunno, drama? suspense?  The opening sequence features two characters driving their cars, with some heavy metal background.  The camera is just an inch from either's face, and the scene goes on forever.  Who are they?  Where are they going?  I've been watching this movie for four minutes, do I have to watch more?",1496016000,,580,4.917525773195877
8704153,4,B00U2YNMLS,"This is a horrible movie.  I wanted to see what was included with prime.  That's why I enjoyed it.  It's like watching a home movie.  The acting and pacing is way off, but the film quality has a gritty, real-world feeling, despite the premise.  It captures a scary Halloween movie with the masked villains.  It's like listening to a black metal album; it's poorly made and sucks by conventional standards, but I watched it because it was different and of a tasteless nature.  The flaw-amongst-flaws of this film is that I don't know how Amazon came up with a description of the film, because other than Satanists having ""church"" and killing townspeople.  I don't know what's going on in-between.",1489968000,,695,4.781512605042017
