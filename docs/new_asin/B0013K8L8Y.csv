8251558,3,B0013K8L8Y,"Very interesting if you are a fan of Bukowski's work. Though a few words, most of it is him insulting the audience and drinking, the camera is just a basic camcorder from the early 80's so it lacks quality, and sometimes the filmmaker focuses on the audience instead of Bukowski.

Overall though, it's good, but have to be a fan of his work to truly appreciate it.",1366934400,2,364,4.432835820895522
