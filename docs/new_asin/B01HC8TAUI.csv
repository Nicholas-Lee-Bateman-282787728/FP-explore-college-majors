7785562,5,B01HC8TAUI,"Paul Owens is amazing.  I'm a teacher, so prior to bringing home my puppy, I went full-tilt nerd, and I read about every book I could get my hands on regarding puppy training and burned through a not insignificant amount of highlighters in the process. Owens is the best. He makes everything that seems nebulous (and, therefore, intimidating) about the puppy training process and systematizes it into actionable steps that are easy to follow and effective. As a first time puppy owner, I have to say there is near nothing as cool as seeing my now 10-week-old puppy ""get it"" and begin offering the desired behaviors and listening. Beyond just being super cool, I really feel like it's helping me to build a foundation of communication. I bought this DVD as a supplement to his book The Puppy Whisperer, which was the best training and care book I read. The book is incredibly comprehensive and very accessible for the new pet owner. And the video helps you to see it all in action. Totally recommend the book and the video as a combo. Hope this helps!",1489968000,7,1050,4.645161290322581

7785566,2,B01HC8TAUI,"I was able to watch part of this DVD and it did give some good basic information on how to train your dog without harsh corrections. However, the DVD was defective, and kept skipping parts of the information (cutting out of one technique and jumping to the next chapter). So I returned it and continue to search for another training DVD.",1484524800,,337,4.540983606557377
7785567,1,B01HC8TAUI,"I love that his approach is positive, but I did not take away much of anything from this DVD.  I wasted my time and money.",1476748800,,122,3.88
7785568,5,B01HC8TAUI,"This DVD is a bundle of joy. Not only do these methods work, Paul's style is infectious and a true example of how powerful laughter can be - the end credits alone are worth the price.",1468454400,8,183,4.111111111111111
7785569,5,B01HC8TAUI,"Paul's amazing! This DVD has all the important stuff to get your dog or puppy off to a great start in your home. His positive approach is both dog and people friendly. The quick start guide has a schedule that is easy to adapt to your home routine. It makes dog training so approachable.
This is a tool that can make the whole process of bringing a dog or puppy into your home seem less overwhelming.
I recommend it highly!",1468454400,,423,4.3
7785570,5,B01HC8TAUI,This is just what I needed. I've raised dogs my whole life and there was a lot of information in this DVD that I never knew. It was incredibly helpful. Most of all it's easy and fun to use.,1468281600,,189,3.871794871794872
7785571,5,B01HC8TAUI,"Paul Owens' DVD is the perfect gift for new dog and puppy owners and is one of the most useful, sensible, practical, and easy to digest informative DVDs out there. He gets it, and it shows. Just watch this video and learn from THE pro. There is nothing difficult or intimidating about the step by step process of learning the basics, as he teaches them, and this DVD is as FUN to watch as it is well produced. This is not your typical boring training video.

These lessons are easy to follow, the puppies are adorable, Paul is thoughtful and clear in his presentation of how to master, really, introducing a dog or puppy to your family with POSITIVITY!

I've met Paul in person, taken classes from him,  and I can tell you that the person on the DVD is the same person in reality and practice. He is an affable fellow, he's kind, he's perfected dog training after decades of being in the trade and learning about every breed type (and every owner type) and temperament. If I didn't say it before (oh yeah I did) HE GETS IT.

And dogs love him!

I keep copies of this DVD on hand and give the out as gifts for friends when they get new dogs, and sometimes even when I see my friends having issues with dogs they've owned for some time. Hey, we all need reminders from time to time and this DVD is not only good for learning how to train your pup for the first time, but it's good to go back to for a refresher from time to time (we bi-peds need the training as much as out beloved four legged do).

Paul's extensive knowledge of animal behavior, temperament, breed specifics, problem solving (and avoiding) will help you get on, and stay on the right track with your pup.

This DVD is a must have.",1467763200,11,1696,4.297805642633229
8764968,5,B01HC8TAUI,Fantastic insight and easy to understand,1537747200,,40,5.833333333333333
8764969,5,B01HC8TAUI,"After watching this dvd, I was so impressed with how Paul Owens trains dogs with kindness and not the scary ""alpha"" attitude, that I tracked him down in LA for private classes for my dogs. He IS the original dog whisperer, and he whispers to my dogs gently and doesn't bark! Highly recommend the dvd and Paul. Another lucky strike when looking for solutions while shopping on Amazon!",1512950400,2,383,4.647058823529412
8764970,5,B01HC8TAUI,Very helpful,1512259200,,12,5.5
8764971,5,B01HC8TAUI,"I love that this video is directed toward pets which have been adopted.  I bought it for our Grandson to train our recently rescued pup, but haven't had an opportunity to try it out yet.  I'm sure it's just perfect for a young boy to learn to train a dog.",1508371200,,255,4.08
8764972,4,B01HC8TAUI,"I found this DVD to be very helpful to train my new puppy. Paul Owens demonstrates his methods and shows what he's found to work best with puppies. I learned a ton and my entire family has watched so that we are all on the same page. I liked his personality and how he genuinely adores the dogs he trains. Lots of take always I never knew like having the dog find a treat instead of jump on guests is super helpful.  Overall, I'm happy with this DVD.",1506902400,2,450,4.113636363636363
8764973,5,B01HC8TAUI,What a great DVD with positive training.  Paul Owens shows step by step.,1504569600,,72,4.538461538461538
8764974,5,B01HC8TAUI,I got it as a gift for a family member that got a puppy. I have kids and wanted to make sure the puppy didn't become aggressive or not listen. The new owner has been watching the dvd and following the direction and I'm very happy with the progress the puppy has made and how well behaved the puppy is becoming. He has had pets before that have not been trained well so I give this dvd a lot of credit!,1499731200,,401,3.962962962962963
8764975,2,B01HC8TAUI,I can't recommend this training.  I have trained 5 golden retrievers over the years... all successful.  Treats are the main motivation here and the dog expects this all the time.  Praise is better.,1499385600,,197,4.909090909090909
8764976,2,B01HC8TAUI,"The DVD is defective.  The training techniques seem to be helpful, but they aren't if you can't play the DVD.  We got to see about half of it and then it started refusing to navigate properly, and then finally wouldn't leave the menu page.  Bad dog!",1498694400,2,249,4.369565217391305
8764977,5,B01HC8TAUI,"I bought this as a gift for a friend with a new - large, very active - puppy.  She loved it. That's all I care about. Thanks!",1493942400,,125,3.6296296296296298
