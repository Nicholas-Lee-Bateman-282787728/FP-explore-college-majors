4261395,5,B0044LYRK0,The singing in this show makes it super fun and my 19 month old can't get enough of it. This is his favorite DVD. There is one episode and then a normal episode. I wish there were more singing episodes. My son would love that.,1305158400,2,226,4.044444444444444
4261396,5,B0044LYRK0,"My sons love Sid the Science Kid and this DVD is great because it contains two episodes, one of which is lots of singing!  The first episode entails a school holiday so Sid has all his friends and even teacher Suzy over to perform a mini-concert for mom, dad, and Zeke!  Each kid sings a song about their favorite science activity - weather, charts, wheels, and more!  The songs are simple for kids to understand and fun to listen to.  I love that my sons think they are watching a fun cartoon not realizing that they are learning from it.  The whole episode has so much singing and it is different since the whole episode takes place in Sid's house and not school.  The second episode is all about the weather and temperatures which is great now to watch with our crazy weather we are having!  It is a typical Sid the Science kid episode at school.  This DVD is very cute and I still cannot believe it is less than $7.00!",1296345600,22,922,4.319767441860465

4261398,5,B0044LYRK0,"I few months ago a family member of mine gave us a stack of DVD's since there were no longer children to watch them at their home. Among the dvds was a tv show called Sid the Science Kid that I have never heard of before. The episodes originally aired on PBS kids before my children were even born. Just as the intro began my kids jumped up and started dancing and there ya go, they had a new favorite kids show to watch. I decided to do a search to see what episodes were out there and came across the Sid's Sing Along dvd. They like to sing and dance so I knew this would be great for them. It run for approximately 60 minutes featuring all my children's favorite songs and a bonus episode. It starts off with Sid wondering what he can do on his day off from school and has his friends over for a playdate. They pull together a show in the back yard and sing their favorite science songs. My girls are ages 2 and 4 and they both loved each and every second.",1467849600,,959,4.052631578947368

4261421,5,B0044LYRK0,"Okay,this is my daughter's favorite episode of all time, however it is the least educational in terms of science, but we watch it every now and then for a review. The children act like very realistic children, May is all shy and scared to sing and then gets way too overenthusiastic just like every shy child that realizes singing in crowds is fun. But wow, Susie's dedication! She shows up at the sing along on her day off!",1374192000,,424,4.448717948717949

4261426,5,B0044LYRK0,The songs are adorable and help the kids learn without even knowing it.  Pleasant singing rather than the annoying voices that tend to be on kid shows/cds.,1363910400,2,155,4.7407407407407405
4261427,5,B0044LYRK0,My granddaughter loves this DVD. I could not find any of the Sid DVD's in the store. I am so glad I purchased these. She watches them all the time.,1357603200,,147,3.933333333333333
4261428,1,B0044LYRK0,"Not a fan of this, even though there are a lot of people out there who are. I just don't get it. Pretty much everything JHC has done has been brilliant... until this.

One of the things I dislike about this show is how Sid talks like someone with a developmental disorder. I know there will be overly sensitive people out there who will call me ""rude"", ""insensitive"", whatever, but that's really what it sounds like to me, folks. I really put my foot down when my toddler, who had very well developed verbal skills, started talking like Sid, with the stutters and inflections, and all - just like Sid. Made me cringe. So, yes, IMO the vocal talent is terrible.

The animation is probably the worst part of the show, however (once again, IMO). Remember when JHC pioneered in puppetry? Long before the days of incessant CGI, we had one lonely crusader in Hollywood who kept the torch lit brightly on how to make live-action characters, instead of falling back on cheap computer graphics. I was floored when I realized this was JHC. Without knowing what's going on, it seems to me the current owners of JHC are merely cashing in on the companies name while putting out sub-par product that pales in comparison to the creative genius it used to be.

Once again, that's just MY opinion folks. Don't get all bent out of shape over it! I know there are many rabid die-hard Sid fans out there who can't help picking fights with people who have anything bad to say about this show. But you need to get over it. Maybe you should all watch the episode about respecting other people's opinions, eh?",1356048000,,1586,4.538461538461538
4261429,5,B0044LYRK0,"I purchased this as a gift. My son used to love it, and I know plenty of children who do. Very educational. I however, find Sid and the rest of the characters to be unpleasant in appearance, and the voices are annoying. I used to beg my son to watch Word World instead. Great show for kids....not the whole family....unless you're really just so bored that you want to fill your day with hideous cartoon kids with man voices.",1355356800,,425,4.3924050632911396

4261431,5,B0044LYRK0,"My daughter loves Sid the Science kid and she is bearly 3!  It doesn't have a ton of songs, but it is thoroughly enjoyable.  She loves it!  I also love the science experiments they do.  I'm starting my daughter early in loving science!",1352764800,4,235,4.395348837209302
4261432,5,B0044LYRK0,"We watch ""Sid"" as the babies call him, everyday on PBS here in Houston. The movie helps me on the weekends when he doesn't come on. It is great because the young babies know all the characters and sing with then, YES we have the microphone that goes with the movie. Great buys!",1331510400,,277,4.245283018867925
4261433,5,B0044LYRK0,"This is a cute DVD, my kid likes it and I am not annoyed with it in the least. My kid loves music and sing a longs, although you should know there are no follow the bouncing ball sing along here. The sing along, is more like a pageant that the kids throw on a day off school where they sing their favorite songs from school.

The only thing is there seems to be an exceptional amount of trailers or commercials for other cartoons on it. The longest I have ever experienced in any movie.",1327536000,3,486,4.11578947368421
4261434,5,B0044LYRK0,"My son loves it! He plays it pretty much nonstop all day everyday!  As a parent I can get annoyed with this, but I know if I need to get something done around the house I can pop this in and he will be ok and I can do what I have to do.",1325548800,,236,3.3703703703703702
4261435,5,B0044LYRK0,This is a fantastic movie.  My (almost) 4-year old daughter loves it and it has become one of her favorites.  The substance of the movie is very educational yet it is presented in a fun manner.  It is comprised of lots of singing and dancing - fun for every child.  The songs are simple enough that my daughter has learned most of the words and can sing along.  I truly enjoy Gabriella's song about charts and what a handy dandy scientific tool they are and Sid's parents singing the song about estimating.,1320105600,2,506,4.456521739130435
4261436,5,B0044LYRK0,This video has my son's favorite episode on it - Holiday Sing Along Special.  The music is fun and it is educational!,1309824000,2,117,4.318181818181818

8416190,3,B0044LYRK0,I'll have to save this dvd for later for my child as they are a little too young to appreciate it right now as a toddler. My child enjoyed 1 of the songs on this dvd but was soon bored.,1480377600,,185,3.65
8416191,5,B0044LYRK0,Educational and my daughter love it:-),1478563200,,38,5.5
8416192,5,B0044LYRK0,"My three year old daughter borrowed a Sid the Science Kid Dvd from our local library. I reluctantly put it in for us to watch and was surprised that I actually liked the program too. I thought it might be annoying, but the songs were catchy and my daughter picked up on a lot of the material and we had good discussions. I caught us singing a long to the songs. This series reminds me of the love they I had for Fraggle Rock and the Muppets as a child. After we returned the DVR to the library I went to Amazon to see what Sid the Science Kid DVDs might be available. I think my daughter will be excited to receive this dvd.",1477094400,,624,4.040322580645161
8416193,5,B0044LYRK0,"This is a great DVD for kids. There are a lot of songs if your little one is musical, but they are songs about science, which gets your kids thinking and asking questions (as opposed to a lot of kids' songs which are non-sensical). The episodes are not too long or too short, and the topics change frequently enough to keep kiddo's attention. I have a 3 year old son, and this is one of his favorites!",1474329600,,401,4.220779220779221
