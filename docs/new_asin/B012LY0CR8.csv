7352643,1,B012LY0CR8,Unnecessary drama and exaggerated scenes too ridiculous to make sense. The movie felt like it was mashed up. It would swing from slapstick comedy to shallow serious drama with no continuity. I kept expecting the story to recover till the end but nothing changed.,1504915200,,262,4.9772727272727275

7352645,5,B012LY0CR8,Joo Won is such a great actor. I actually hated that the movie was so short. This is a great story about determination and self acceptance wrapped in fashion. Definitely worth the watch!,1502496000,,186,4.666666666666667

8726258,3,B012LY0CR8,"This film was a little hard to follow because it starts off with a scene, a character intro, then a totally different scene in terms of setting, characters, tone/mood etc. Its hard to understand the flow of the film and the opening scene doesnt end up connecting to the rest of the story until much later in the film. I thought that the film was entertaining and had an American Pie type of vibe. I liked the films concept since it reflects the importance of fashion and face value in regards to how a person is treated by their peers. All of the characters in the film have respect for brand names and directly relate a persons physical appeal to their value, reflecting how society values the superficial. Its somewhat of a coming of age film that likes doing over the top special effects to make it more comedic. Its something you should watch when you have spare time, want to laugh, and aren't really looking for much substance.",1521936000,,933,4.5266272189349115
8726259,5,B012LY0CR8,This was defiantly one of the quirkiest movies I've watched. It was fun to watch and see actors and actresses I know from other shows playing different character types then what I usually see them in. I hope they had a lot of fun filming this movie.,1520294400,,249,4.319148936170213
8726260,4,B012LY0CR8,This movie is exactly what you'd expect. A silly fun movie. Good guys sometimes win. :D,1519689600,,87,4.5
8726261,3,B012LY0CR8,a little hard to follow at first & very silly. Kid that everyone picks on keeps changing schools till he finally decides he's tired of running away from bullies. The end was a bit too much. There didn't see to be a reason for him to have such a spectacular achievement . The fact that he had friends & accepted Himself really should have been enough of a win for him. For a free movie it was OK,1516060800,,394,4.064102564102564

8726265,4,B012LY0CR8,"This was a surprisingly funny and heartwarming movie! Some parts were a bit childish and the ending did not provide a satisfying resolution of a few story lines, however, I enjoyed the movie overall and would consider watching it again.",1505001600,2,236,4.925
