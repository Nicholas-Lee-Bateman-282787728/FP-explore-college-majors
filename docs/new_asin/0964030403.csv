And he does it all so quietly and sanely, so gently. There is no arrogance in the man, just assurance, clarity and genius. I wish there were more interviews with others of Mr. Wright's status, like Orson Welles, Bertrand Russell, Picasso, all kinds of REAL people who are REALLY interesting, but alas, there are not! Thoroughly enjoyable and inspirational.",1453939200,,533,4.741935483870968

Whatever men or women may say about Frank Lloyd Wright, history has declared him the greatest architect of the 20th century. Some say he is the greatest architect in the world. But what does Frank Lloyd Wright have to say about himself?
  We are privileged to get to hear what Wright thinks and says about a vast number of subjects in this series of interviews produced in 1957. At 90 years old, Frank Lloyd Wright speaks his mind in the two part series of interview with a young Mike Wallace ( Of 60 Minutes fame.). Young Mike throws out questions challenging Wright and attempts to pin him down on every single detail. Highly individualistic Wright takes up the challenge and spars gracefully with his young interviewer and knocks down his opponent.
  What you see and hear in these interview is a man who is unrepentent about his personal life, believes that he could rebuild America, hates the mob mentality and is still highly motivated to build more structures to complement the natural landscape. Frank Lloyd Wright is reflective, intelligent and confident of his place in history and doesn't mind telling one so. The interviews don't deal with his architectural achievements as such but enables you to get a glimpse of the man, how his mind works and an appreciation of his contributions to the American scene beyond his creations.
  Frank Lloyd Wright is enjoyable and wise in his presentation of himself before the camera. What you see is what you get. In many cases he is far ahead of his time than Wallace. Enjoy this engaging interview with one of America's great icons.",971654400,17,1713,4.809523809523809
