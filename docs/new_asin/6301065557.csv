311256,5,6301065557,"I am lucky enough to own all of the Firm videos. This tape Low Impact Aerobics (formerly called Vol. 2) with Janet Jones Gretzky is one of the toughest for me! Do not be misled by the title. Though both feet stay on  the floor throughout the workout, its intense! It doesnt help that Ms.  Gretzky looking absolutely stunning in a white leotard, barely breaks a  sweat while lifting heavy weights. When I first got the tape I could barely  get through it. However with, determination and desire I can now do the  tape using the size weights Janet uses. But its still challenging! Thats  part of the charm of the Firm. The lavish set, beautiful music and  outstanding instructors inspire you to achieve your best! If you are  beginner just do what you can and eventually you will work up to completing  the entire tape. I have really increased my cardiovascular endurance and  improved my physique as a result of these tapes. Warm up is 6minutes.  Aerobics 25minutes. Hip/Thigh work 18minutes. Ab work 7minutes and final  strech 9minutes. You will need dumbbells ankle weights and lots of  determination to do this workout. Its GREAT!",956880000,52,1132,4.743589743589744

311258,5,6301065557,"This is currently my favorite Firm tape. I became curious to try it after seeing a part of it on a Firm Parts aerobic workout tape. There are no ""step"" exercises involved in this workout as there are on some of  the other Firm tapes, but it doesn't matter. This is a very strenuous,  60-minute workout tape that really provides an excellent aerobic and  lower-body workout with weights. But as previous reviewers have warned:  THIS IS NOT A LOW-IMPACT WORKOUT!. I don't know why they called it that.  You will really get a challenging workout using this tape. It's too early to  say that I've seen results yet. But I definitely FEEL the results. It's  worth every dime.",954288000,19,669,4.61864406779661
311259,4,6301065557,"I am starting to excercise after having a baby, this was a good video to build muscle and endurance with weights.

People who are  dooming themselves to failure will not enjoy these tapes because you have  to really work. There is none of that prissy aerobics where you can't even  get your heart rate up.

311261,5,6301065557,"I am a college student in reasonably good shape.  My mother has always bought exercise videos trying to lose weight and I have always tried them.  Most are a joke; I can do the entire thing without being winded.
The Firm  was different.  This one I couldn't do the max and finish.  It is based on  how heavy the weight you're using.  My mom and I can do the same workout  but I'll use heavier weights and will both be spent when it is over.
I  have watched all of those TV infomercials advertising workout plans.  This  video is not a gimmie like most of the ads on TV offer but is a real  workout that is both challenging and doable by everyone.

It was the first FIRM video I bought and has remained my  favorite.  As a result of this great workout, I have since bought 6 more  FIRM tapes.  As with all FIRM tapes, there is NO cheating.  You really  sweat!!  And, you feel GREAT when you are done.  Stop ""thinking""  about buying this one and just do it.  You won't regret it.",915408000,4,490,3.9791666666666665
311263,5,6301065557,"I'm a fan of all of the FIRM videos--they've made a big impact on my health and my overall outlook on life, as cheesy as that sounds.  This is my favorite of the ""total body workout"" series, because it gives  me the hardest workout for my time invested.  A good combo of weights and  aerobics, with just the right degree of difficulty (which you can modify by  using different weights).  I think this is a must-buy, but of course (as  with all FIRM videos)there are some caveats--the main one being to get  ready for MAJOR arm/ upper body work.  Don't be misled by the  ""Low-Impact Aerobics"" subtitle, as this is more than just jumping  around and yelling ""feel the burn!""  Yes, you'll be at an aerobic  heart rate for a good long time, but it's maintained by a near-exhausting  (but very fulfilling) series of presses and squats.  Also, if you want a  major leg/bun workout, look elsewhere (Total Body Vol. 1 is good).  And the  ""guest instructor,"" Janet Jones-Gretzky, doesn't cue very well  and tends to get the whole right/left thing (it's reversed for the  instructor) mixed up a few times.  But these are small quibbles about a  tape that really is an excellent addition to your video library--I own 10  FIRM tapes and this is the one I return to more than any other.  Give it a  try and see.",913420800,55,1298,4.515151515151516

311383,5,6301065557,"Bought this back in January of this year and have been doing it ever since in rotation with Jane Fonda's Original Workout (1982), New Workout (1985), and The Firm Workout (1986). I do each DVD for 5 days every week so that I can change it up and I also do all of them to make sure that my body is exposed to different kinds of workouts. So far doing this specific Firm workout has been a pretty good experience. It's one of my favorite workout dvds and I do see the results. My body is more toned compared to a year ago especially in my butt, hip, thigh, and leg areas. The standing cardio is pretty tedious but that's necessary so that you can see results. The leg, thigh, and hips segment is much lighter than the one in the first Firm dvd. The abdominal and butt segments aren't too tedious but they still do the job. I would say this dvd is kind of lighter than the original as far as the exercises go but it's not really low impact because it's still pretty hard.  I think the original Firm dvd from 1986 is harder than this one especially because it has a lot more squats and lunges but this low impact workout isn't a cake walk either. As far as it saying that it takes 10 workouts for you to start seeing results I would say that is partially true. I think it can take people a little bit more than the 10 workouts before they start seeing results. Once again that depends on your body type and diet. For me I would say it took me about a month but then again I'm not the world's healthiest eater and from time to time I like my chocolate and my desserts. Just being completely honest even though I have maintained a huge amount of weight loss for about 6 years now. At 19 in 2010 I was a borderline diabetic and didn't start exercising until a month before my 20th birthday. 6 months later I had lost about 20 pounds and no longer found myself at risk for diabetes. It was hard for me but I did it. At the time I would go to the gym and do the bicycle, elliptical, and rowing machines. I did spin classes for 2 years when I was 21-23 years old and some light power lifting classes at my gym.  I then got into workout dvds when I went to another city for college at 23 and didn't have time to go the gym. I've been doing them ever since. Now I'm 26 going on 27 in October and I started doing the Firm workout dvds 2 months after my 26th birthday. I want to clarify once again that some people may think that this workout is light or easy just because it says low impact aerobics. Especially people who are new to the Firm or new to exercising. I think you should try to do some lighter workout dvds or less grueling ones like Jane Fonda's collection because she does have the option of doing a beginner or advanced workout. The Firm does not offer that so right off the bat you're doing a very advanced workout which I don't recommend for beginners or people who don't have too much experience with weights. Overall this workout is pretty relaxing and it's always fun to do. Janet Jones is an amazing instructor just like Susan Harris is in the other Firm workouts. The fancy set is also the same with some minor changes. I love the statues and artwork on the walls. I feel like I am really there with the cast members. Id also like to add that if you're going up in weight it obviously will be harder when you're lifting especially in this workout because you're moving around a lot during the first half of it. On the contrary, during the 1986 dvds first segment you're pretty much standing in place, doing squats, and lunging while lifting which isn't as hard but I still think that that workout as a whole is tough from start to finish compared to this 1988 version. This dvd is still great for almost being 30 years old.",1498780800,5,3733,4.212290502793296

This workout  hits every muscle with gusto and you feel so strong afterwards. It strips the fat off. So very effective and doesn't waste your time. I can say the same for the other volumes. Also the info  on which exercise works a certain muscle and what shape you'll end up with is great. I hate the newer workouts something is missing.,1484179200,,489,4.293478260869565

I used it when it was on VHS if that tells you how long I've used it. I have used many firm tapes in the past and I always come back and love to do this one. It's low impact and great on your knees and joints. Plus you can use hand weights so as we ladies get older, we can exercise and do weight bearing exercises as well to strengthen bones. You can use small 2# weights and work your way up to 8# and more if you like. You won't bulk up but you will have stronger arms and you will feel your back strengthening also as you strengthen your arms and core. It's a great DVD!",1475884800,5,711,3.8767123287671232

311450,5,6301065557,"I used to do The Firm workouts all the time. I have forgotten how hard they were. I used to have all of the volume 1 workouts, and I love this one because it doesn't require the box. I've known people to do this video with nothing but a set of 5 pound weights. Her stand up routine is a more repetitive that I remember, but I didn't find it quite boring. Before this I tried the Crunch Time Working with Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun. The use of the box in that one hurt my knees, so I got this one, and I love it.",1459900800,5,515,3.8679245283018866
311501,5,6301065557,"I have tried every type of workout there is over the years--everything from Pilates to Callanetics to Bodyflex to muscle building and core training, Jillian Michaels, you name it. Believe me, I have tried it all. Trust me when I tell you that this is the best workout there is. Not only is The Firm the best, but this particular one with Janet Jones is the very best one of The Firm workouts I have every tried.
This is the perfect blend of cardio, muscle toning, stretching, abs, thighs, hips, and arms. I mean it, she gets into every single area of the body like no other workout I have every done. This one has a great thigh and butt sequence that is probably the best sequence out there, especially given that it is integrated into muscle and cardio so well. If the hip and thigh sequence is done with adequate ankle weights, that really kicks it up a notch.
This is simply the most thorough workout that will sculpt your body the way you want it. And it does it all in 65 minutes. The reason this is such a complete workout in only 65 minutes is because of the way it combines movements. For example, you are not just doing cardio, you are doing it while lifting weights. Most workouts do one or the other.
The first half of the workout is an excellent toning and overall cardio workout. You get a good arm workout in this, which is unlike other arm toning workouts I have done that tend to build large muscles faster. She works everything from the shoulder blades to the triceps to the back shoulder blades. This really trims the arms and makes them lovely and toned, but not bulky. All of this is being done while a fantastic cardio workout is taking place.
The second half of the video focuses on specific areas, and this works everything from abs to the waist to the legs.
I continue to be impressed with this workout, because no workouts since this have even come close to getting in the proper stretching, spot toning, cardio, and weight training in 65 minutes and has sculpted my body the way this one has. I try to do this 3 times a week, and I alternate with something else the other days. The search is over, people!
I paid full price for this item. All opinions are my own.",1459209600,22,2189,4.367647058823529

311505,5,6301065557,"Just gotta say, people, RELAX. The original FIRM Classic tapes are designed around the concept of PROGRESSION - which means, they will be hard if you try to do them with weights and full steam ahead on the very first day. MODIFY. If you can't do jumping jacks now, or your knees start to hurt, MARCH IN PLACE. As the muscles around your joints get stronger, you find you WILL be able to keep up and your sore knees and arthritic joints will show improvement. If the cuing is confusing, try doing the moves with no weights until you get it down. I've been doing the FIRM CLASSICS 1-6 since the late 80's when the VHS tapes were $50 EACH because they will give you RESULTS. As you get stronger, add more weights, add more intensity in the cardio section and you will have your BEST BODY ever. I've tried them all - Cathe Freidrich, Insanity, P90X, PiYo, etc. etc. etc. and NOTHING will give you the results that Vol. 1-6 and the FIRM Cross-Trainers do. I've had men tell me I have the body of a 30 year old, and I'm over 50.

I also love Volumes 1&3 and found that I enjoyed this one even more then those 2!I am so glad I gave this a chance and despite being an old workout,my whole body felt worked and unlike many current workouts,this did not have a lot of jumping or high impact moves.

I credit this work out with giving me great, sculpted arms that are ""the"" body part on me that both men and women comment on.  Over the years I have always gone back to this workout to ""get the job done.""  It whips me into shape and I love the cardio, pace, and of course, the amazing results from using 3 & 5 pound weights.  No need to go to a gym or use equipment to get fit and toned.

I no longer own a VCR, and I got tired of listening to a 22 year old cassette tape, so I ordered this DVD.  The picture certainly isn't HD, but it's not poor, either.  The breakdown of the workout allows you to pick which portions of the workout you want to do, if you don't want to do the whole 65 minutes.  I think the first 35 minutes are the best and most productive, so that's all I usually do, and that's what gave me, and continues to give me, toned, solid biceps and triceps, sculpted shoulders, and some back muscles.  I am NOT ""ripped"" or bulky, but I have great arms.  The lower body workout is great for legs, abs & butt, but I don't always have an hour to work out, so I focus on upper body.

311704,5,6301065557,"I considered this rating because I absolutely loved this low impact aerobic workout!  THE BEST of the FIRM Aerobic workouts.  Janet Jones is GREAT!

Janet Jones doesn't push you too hard, just hard enough.  She was trained by the late Anna Benson.  I was fortunate enough to have known Anna and her sister Cynthia Benson when they had two locations in Columbia, SC.  I worked out with both of them.  There is only one location in my area now and it's in Lexington, SC.  I didn't realize it when I ordered this DVD, however, I already had a copy, so now I have two copies.  So if you're interested, I have one in it's original wrapping, never been opened.  Just leave a message below.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone, and I do mean anyone.  It's easy to follow and as I stated above, Janet doesn't push you too hard.  This one isn't a difficult DVD to follow.  Just make sure you've done aerobics before and you're in reasonably good physical shape.  If not, do a little at a time, it  won't take you very long to catch up and in no time at all you'll be a pro!",1397088000,3,1066,4.255

311706,5,6301065557,"This ""vintage"" Firm workout is one of the best ever.  I am 59 years old and have been doing this workout somewhat regularly for over 20 years.  What is great about it is you can start out with no weights and then gradually increase the size of your weights as you work your way up to the most effective level for you.  The movements and instructors are very easy to understand and follow--no complicated, fancy footwork to learn.  I have not found any better workout videos than the early Firm series.  This  includes the Susan Harris video, the Janet Jones video, the LaRenne Chabut video and the compilation video called Firm Parts/5 Day Abs.  These workouts are like the fountain of youth.  They keep you strong and flexible, and are great for your overall sense of well-being.  I love the style of the videos because, with the exception of the compilation video, they are neatly divided in half.  The first half is standing, the second half is floor.  I do half of each video every day and rotate my way through the series.  I also add a 20-30 minute walk or stationary bike ride to the workout.  All in all it's about one hour of my time every day, an investment that continues to pay off.  The nice thing is, I don't have to leave home, I can roll out of bed, have my coffee, and get right to it before I start the rest of my day.  A nice starter weight set would be a pair each of 3, 5, and 7 or 8 pound dumbbells.  For the LaRenne Chabut and compilation workouts you will also need a step.  This can be any kind of step that is solid and sturdy--I got mine used for very little money.  Don't feel bad if you can't do it all the first 10 times through.  Do your best and it WILL pay off!  You will feel so much better and you will see results and find muscles you never even knew you had.  Highly recommend this early Firm series (except the third one, lady in orange leotard, is user unfriendly IMHO).  I noticed another reviewer said she thought the moves were jerky and dangerous in these early videos.  I disagree.  They CAN be dangerous if you use weights that are too heavy for you to handle smoothly, but there is a disclaimer that states as much at the beginning of the video.  Start SLOWLY until you build your strength--I believe that is a direct quote from one of the instructors.  Check around on Amazon for the DVD version of these early tapes.  I just ordered the Janet Jones DVD.",1396137600,6,2401,4.313199105145414

The music - nice, rhythmic jazzy pieces with those famous 80's drum patterns, the outfits- hilarious, the moves- honestly, I felt like I was taking a dance class and doing auditions for some 80's dance movie because although the moves were easy she, Janet, moved at a swift pace.

The instructor (Janet Jones-Gretzky) is phenomenal, the exercises come together to utilize all your large muscle groups in a comprehensive manner, there is no needless dialogue, the camera work is effective and helpful, and the music is perfectly cued to each movement.  I have read the negative comments about The Firm Vol. 2 and I find them rather lame.  Even if they have merit (out-of-date with nothing but ""perfect"" people in the video), the production value of this video puts it head & shoulders above the rest.  I used Volumes 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 of the Firm series and Volume 2 is the best.  Personally, I wish I could find an up-to-date video that would duplicate what the Firm Volume 2 did.  If anyone knows of a current video that stands up to the competition of the Firm, Volume 2, please let me know.  The Firm, Volume 2 ROCKS.",1379721600,6,941,4.436046511627907
311741,5,6301065557,"I first did the FIRM workouts in the early 90s and started back with them about a year and a half ago. But instead of getting the classics  (volumes 1- 6) I was purchasing the newer ones  (with the pink covers).  These newer ones did help me reach my fitness goals-  but in hindsight I think it took much longer than if I had used the classics.
The ""pinks"" are great for cardio, but the FIRM seems to have lost it's focus on educating their customers.  The classics were very focused on form, and making sure you worked smarter not just harder.  The pinks do not do this and in fact, sometimes they move dangerously fast with poor form.

I also noticed that I had hit a plateau-  but since working in the classics, I am feeling stronger and looking more toned.  Highly recommend that you get these classics.  Here's a quick blurb about 1-4  (never did 5 & 6- but plan to!)

Volume 1- Susan Harris.  Susan is a terrific lead- she cues well and motivates you to grind out those last few reps.  Susan likes to go heavy on the weights and leads a very challenging floor segment.  This is my favorite one.
Volume 2-  Janet Jones-Gretsky.  Janet is not the motivator that Susan is and she does not cue well, but her workout is still fun and effective.  The choreography of this workout is easy to follow and I feel more graceful when doing this workout.  More focus on upper body and cardio than Volume 1.
Volume 3-  Sandahl Bergman.  This is a perfect blend of the first 2 volumes- both upper and lower body are worked well.  She is a good motivator and makes this tough workout look easy.  I think this volume was the FIRMs introduction of their ""tall"" box.
Volume 4-  Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun .  A shortened version (42 min) that is jam-packed.  This workout includes both heavy sculpting and cardio (with short step box).  Susan is awesome again, and Kai is a fun addition.  My rear ALWAYS hurts after this one . :)

However, the pace is too quick and often the instructor doesn't cue fully between moves and the pace is often too quick in shifting from one exercise to another, particularly if weight adjustments are necessary. Some of the exercises are very strenuous and may create unnecessary potential for injury, particularly with the fast pace (and I'm not one to easily criticize strenuous exercises, as I LOVE volumes 1, 3, and 4 and have been using these for 20 years). I will continue to do this workout occasionally as a break from Firm Classic Volumes 1, 3, and 4 because it's so very effective, but it's just not very enjoyable because of the pace and the length (it's only 5 minutes longer technically, but I often have to stop the cd to catch up/adjust weights in a way I don't have to do with other volumes, which stretches out the length of the workout for me). It seems that Jones-Gretzky is less of an experienced instructor than Harris (Vol. 1 & 4) or Bergman(Vol 3).",1356912000,,1089,4.589743589743589
311790,5,6301065557,"I had bought this as a VHS in 1991 and just fell in love with it. I am now buying the DVD as my VCR finally died.

I recommend this DVD to anyone who is serious about getting or staying in shape. I will warn that every time I start this workout again (last time after a few years) I WAS SORE. I swim and do kickboxing pretty regular but will still get sore after using this.

Janet Jones motivates me with her dancer's body, cool demeanor, and smooth actions. The moves are challenging especially the leg segment of lunges and squats. The transitions are clearly stated. Within about 5 workouts I saw a difference in my body.

What I didn't like was sometimes she gave a safety instruction e.i. ""foot above the knee"" when she had already finished with one side of the body and working on the other side, or modifications with her second set ""if this is too hard just bring the weight to your shoulders"".

For safety:

If you are just starting, use lighter weights (my son started with soup cans - 16 oz) and work up slowly. For squats and lunges start shallow with strength and time you will be able to go deeper down making sure you can see your toes at all times as not to hurt your knees. Lastly keep your abs tight as one can hyper extend the lower back in the standing overhead arms moves.

311811,4,6301065557,"I have been a longtime fan of the Firm, but the only Firm classic I owned was Volume 1 with Susan Harris.  Now that many of the Classic Firms have been remastered to DVD, I decided to give a couple others a try.  One of them was Volume 2.

I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this workout.  I have heard great things about it over the years, but really took a gamble purchasing it because honestly I can take or leave most of the classics, effective as they are.

I find this is a great complement to Volume 1, with an emphasis on upper body.  Lighter weights are more suitable for this workout because there are a lot of reps!  The whole body is covered though, you have upper body work which much of it is done 4 limb style with some sort of lower body movement.  But you will also see some isolation exercises such as one arm rows for back, pushups for chest, and I even saw pullovers which are one of my favorite exercises for the back.

Like Volume 1 and many of the classics, there is a floorwork section as well which covers the legs well, inner and outer thigh work, table work, bridge work and there is a good ab section as well.  I also really like the stretch at the end.  As mentioned earlier, all you need for this workout are some dumbells and ankle weights.  I found lighter weights to be more suitable, using a range of 3-8 pounders for much of the upper body work, but having a 10 and 12 pounder close by for the back and chest work.  Ankle weights are used for the lower body work, but you can do the exercises without them.  Toe weights are also used here as weight, they were sold by the Firm back in the day.  They are not needed though.

One thing I don't particularly care for with many of the classics is the high impact aerobics, and this workout should not have been titled ""Low Impact Aerobics"".  Yes, there are some low impact aerobics, but there is plenty of high impact also.  Fortunately for me, I have learned how to modify to low impact so I adjust accordingly to suit me.

Say what you want about Janet Jones-Gretzky, but I enjoyed her as a lead.  I wasn't sure I would to be honest, but I thought she did a nice job.  I will admit that I like most of the Firm leads but there are a couple that were just okay.  Janet has quite an enviable shape, and it's evident that she is very fit.

Overall, I am glad that I picked this up. Even though by now this workout is almost 25 years old.  It does appear dated, but it's no doubt effective.  I give this one 4 stars.",1356393600,4,2506,4.16008316008316

I will alternate with my cardio more now. I have tried Tae Bo, dance and other newer FIRM videos. Never got the results I got with this video, ever.
I tried to get it before on DVD and I could not find it so I bought a couple of new FIRM videos. Could not get into them, not at all, so I wasted my money. I am SO happy this is back in DVD I just ordered it and I can't wait to use it. So what if it's 80's, if you want results that is not important...I actually like it, it takes me back!
Just FYI, I did get it cheaper at Collage video.",1345161600,,701,3.7114093959731544

Good old fashioned floor work! I used 3 & 5 & 10 lbs during this workout. You will also need a towel for the stretch. I bought this tape when it first came out and I was 24, 2 yrs after my second child, and I must say I was proud of myself today (now 48) that I could still do 95% of it!",1342051200,,480,3.81

311816,5,6301065557,I started using this video VHS back in 1990. I pulled it out of storage Last December 2011. I lost 15 pounds and got toned in a couple of months. I thought I would try something new this spring. Everyone was raving about insanity. I hated it and it was making me bulky. I'm going back to the firm. I am replacing all my VHS with DVD's.,1338163200,5,335,4.014925373134329
311817,5,6301065557,"I used this video frequently all through my 30s, and my figure was better and I felt stronger then than at any time during my teenage years when I swam and biked a lot.  Having been on a hiatus from vigorous exercise for several years due to medical issues, I bought the DVD and Wow!  I recall the burn AND the benefits!  I'm so excited to be doing it again.  Being 50+ I worked up slowly.  Using this and other Firm DVDs (the classics are the best), in a few months my muscles have become toned, fat has melted away and I feel fantastic.  In addition to exercise I've cleaned up my diet and lost nearly 20 pounds, and my clothes fit well with my new 27"" waist, down 3"" from just 2.5 months ago.

I'm SO glad this particular DVD is available as it is my favorite.  Janet Jones is a pleasant personality and exercise ""buddy.""  She explains the moves well and the cast is all very together and shows the correct form.  There is really no place for flab to hide if you follow this routine 2-3 times/week.

This DVD is advanced aerobics and weight/resistance training, so unless you're already doing advanced workouts, start with no weights.  As someone else said, do not push your knees past the ankles during lunges.  There is a short sequence that includes running in place and jumping jacks, but it's easy to modify this if need be.  The music is cheesy 80s-era stuff, but when I used to do this tape, once I had the sequences down I'd play some old school tunes (eg Earth Wind & Fire) while working out.",1332028800,2,1504,4.344086021505376

I'm really into Low-Impact workouts, and parts of this were probably a little higher impact than I wanted, but again, I just modified it to do what I wanted for my own purposes.

This is an excellent workout! Also, the information given in the little lecture about building muscles and burning fat, etc., is great. It has stuck with me all these years. It was well done.",1308268800,,536,4.203883495145631

This one is one of my favorites, although as someone else said, it isn't really all that much of a low-impact workout. I don't do high-impact so I modified it for my own needs. I don't do jumping jacks, etc.

After taking out anything that I really don't like, because if I force myself to do exercises that I really don't like, I won't do them, it still was highly effective. If you like more high-impact than I do, you're going to be even happier with it than I was.

All-in-all, this is an excellent workout! I expect nothing else from The Firm. I also enjoy the discussion about building muscle, fat burning, etc., and have watched that part over and over, learning more from it every time.",1308268800,,831,4.490066225165563
311838,5,6301065557,"I purchased this workout on VHS when it first came out, back in 1988, based on a positive review I read in PEOPLE magazine.  I had just given birth to my second child. It whipped my figure back into shape, and tightened up every square inch of my body.  Fantastic workout!  I have babied that VHS along through the years, doing my best to maintain its usability, because I could not find it again for purchase (VHS or DVD) until a few years ago.  How thrilling it was to find it on DVD on Amazon!  What a relief! I purchased one DVD, and am about to purchase another copy just to be safe, in case something should happen to the first - that is how amazing this workout is - once you try it, you don't want to lose it!  I use it three times per week, and alternate it every other day with cardio-based workouts 3X per week as well (1 day of rest per week) like the elliptical, the treadmill, etc.  Honestly, it firms every section of your body up. Of course the outfits are dated, and the music is old-school, but that is superficial - what counts in what this workout does to your body. I personally find the music inspiring and motivating.
For beginners, I recommend watching it once through, then starting with no weights the first 3 workouts; then use 1 lb. dumbbells for the next 3 workouts, then move up to 2 lbs. for the next three workouts, then 3 lbs., etc. until you reach whatever weight levels you are comfortable with.  You will see some results after 5 workouts, but if not, do your body and self-esteem a favor and try it for 10 full workouts and then decide if you don't like it.  I have 4 children and was able to get back to a size 6, even after the 4th pregnancy. Yes, some parts are hard on the knees, but you can modify the moves without losing fitness benefits.

311840,5,6301065557,"I've worked out to dozens of exercise videos throughout the last 20+ years since I was a teen, and this is still my favorite one of them all. It moves fast, but once you've done it a few times it's easy to maintain good form while keeping up the pace.  In turn you work every part of your body with light to medium/heavy weights, and when you finish you feel like you just completed a tough class at the gym.  There are some real high-impact aerobics and jumping mixed in that aren't alluded to in the title, but not much, and you can easily keep your feet on the floor and do a low-impact version if that's what you need. I think the Amazon reviewer was unfair to give it such a negative review and deem it too ""unsafe"" to recommend.  This hour-plus video features an extensive warm-up and cool-down stretch, and while it is definitely challenging, it's pretty doubtful it would cause injury to anyone that is half-way fit.  Yes,it's a bit dated: a super-slim Janet Jones Gretzky is sporting an 80's gold chain and scrunchy, and yes, her cueing is so scripted as to sound practically automated, but once you get past it, this workout ROCKS!",1294704000,8,1141,4.471153846153846

The classic aerobic workout with using heavy dumbells with great easy to follow aerobics but intense. The Firm offers you start out with no weights at all for when you first start out,learning the moves of the aerobics and weight moves. Mrs Gretzky janet Jones is a great instructor,going through the 25 minute aerobic segment then you take off your shoes and sock to do concentrated hip and thigh work with dumbells and ankle weight with a optional board to put under your feet during bridge work and working the abdominal as well as the glutes,using great heavy dumbell moves to make your arm burn making them sleek and slender. I have worn out my videos for this great 65 minute workout,now I have the DVD with great picture and sound. I highly suggest this great classic 1988 The Firm workout volume 2 with a very great and beautiful and informative instructor Janet Jones-Gretzky.

311867,5,6301065557,"I've owned almost every single Firm video workout--from the Classics--to the WAVE.

LET ME TELL YOU...out of ALL of them--THIS one is FAR more effective then the newest ones. Although I do love the new ones...I cannot for some reason find ANY other workout on the market as effective as the FIRM classics!

I also use CATHE FREDRICHS (she is GOOD and for advanced people only)..but I find I keep coming back to the wonderful beloved Firm classics..

This one--is a GREAT upper body..

In my opinion, all you need for a perfect body is these videos/dvds:

-FIRM Classic #2 (this one)

-FIRM Classic #1--we all know how wonderful Susan Harris is!!! :)

-FIRM Classic #3 (great interval training)

-FIRM Cardio -Maximum Cardio (WITH CARISSA FOSTER ONLY!!)--that one is hard to find on DVD!! Simply another BEST!!

-FIRM-Tough Tape--with Tracy Long--the BEST.

-Any Cathe Fredrich Step/Drill dvd workout--she is the best for Cardio--she will work your butt off!!

Anyhow, THIS workout is just ""immortal""..and I don't give a hoot about the 80's style, music..etc..(well the music IS a bit cheesy.lol)..BUT..DO NOT BE FOOLED...this workout is HARD and EFFECTIVE..will give you AMAZING results!

The floor runtine is tough--but as most FIRM lovers all know--Classic #1 with Susan Harris is probably THE most toughest floor workout on video..and THAT one is superb as well!

Listen..all you need to do is alternate this video with classic #1 and 3, and PLEASE do find Maximum Cardio with Carissa Foster, and you will just ADORE that one too!! Very fun, good music and NEVER BORING(like most FIRMS ARE), along with Tracy Long's Tough Tape, and a few Cathe step aerobics..and I promiss you--you will have that bikini body..

Of course we cannot forget that eating right (and clean) is 70% of your results..so DO eat healthy..and you will be sooooo happy you invested in this oldie--but VERY GOOD GOODIE!!",1266192000,85,1894,4.990445859872612
311868,5,6301065557,"I used these videos back in the 90s to get in rockin' good shape.  They were dated even then -- the workout wear is hilarious, all bubblegum colors and the men are in SHORTY shorts and muscle tees, but this workout is just incredibly effective.  The synthesizer music, while funny at first, gets to be catchy and soon you'll find it circling around in your head at the oddest times.
I was so excited to see these Firm classics come out on DVD because my VHS copies finally bit the dust a year or so ago.  I've been doing the workout now for a few weeks, I can already tell a difference.  Buyer beware, this workout contains one segment of decidedly high impact aerobics (considering it's called ""Low Impact Aerobics"").  It will prove quite challenging for beginners, but keep at it and you'll soon be able to do all the moves with low weights.  Even when I was in fantastic shape, however, I never got to the point where I was using more than 3 or 5 lb. weights for most of it (10 pound weights only for just a tiny section of the workout at the end).  And TWO sets of ankle weights really aren't necessary.  Work your way up to one set and you'll be good.  The breakdown is thus:  1 minute talking about equipment, 3 minutes ""hot warmup,"" 4 minutes stretching, 25 minutes aerobics (most of it with weights), 28 minutes of hips, abs, and chest work (most with weights, also mostly on the floor), 8 minutes of stretching (my favorite part).  If you do the whole workout, it's 65 mins total.
I also have the ""Boomers"" workout, which is also quite challenging and not really for old folks, as advertised.  There's lots of squats and work on the Firm ""box"" in that one.",1265068800,10,1665,4.387622149837133

Well Im 23 now and of course alot has changed including my weight and all I can seem to think about is getting this workout on DVD. If you are really trying to FIRM up and get into shape this is it! You will fall in love with this workout just don't give up and complete the entire 65 mins of it...you will feel very proud of yourself.

At first I wasn't able to do the full workout or use all of the weights but my strength and stamina built up quickly and in 4 months I lost that 40 pounds and achieved the best body I've ever had in my life.

311874,4,6301065557,"I'll say a few words about the DVD itself, but first, the workout...

My mom did the classic Firm workouts when they first came out, I remember volumes 1-3 specifically getting heavy rotation.  This volume was always my favorite.  A good amount of time is spent on the warm-up, and beginning and ending stretches.  I've always liked the pace of this workout, as well.  Beware, those of weak knees, in this, and any classic Firm workout, you will be doing lunges, and lots of them.  If your knees are a problem spot for you, this might not be your cup of tea.  Also, you'll notice on the video that when doing squats, lots of knees are going out past the toes.  We know better now, so this doesn't really bother me, I correct the form without even thinking about it.  That's the only real adjustment I make in form when doing the workout.  As always, watch the workout first before trying to perform it, so you get a feel for the flow and proper execution of the moves.

Low impact... no.  It's not low impact.  During the cardio sections of the workout you will be bouncing and jumping and taking both feet off the floor at the same time.  Be prepared for this.  You will be moving.  Ladies, I highly recommend a sports bra with proper support!!

A lot of people complain about how 80's the classic Firm workouts are.  Well, yes.  They were made in the 80's.  I find it rather amusing, the hair, the massive amounts of make-up, the pastel and neon colored workout clothes... but it doesn't bother me.  The music, in my opinion, isn't any worse than the music on the other workout videos I own.  This may be because I am so familiar with this video from my younger days that it makes me feel nostalgic.  Either way, it's not distracting or  ridiculous so I'm okay with it.

I like Janet Jones as the instructor on this video.  She looks great and she's got great execution.  You can see the sheen of sweat on her, and hear her getting out of breath when giving instruction, so you know she's working just as hard as you are.  Some people complain about breathiness in an instructor's voice, but doesn't that mean they're doing it properly?  If they're not out of breath, then something's wrong with either the workout, their execution of it, or both.  I personally like the instructor to be as out of breath as I am.

Unless you're in great shape, don't expect to keep up completely and use the full weight regimen when first doing this workout.  Ease into it.  I remember being in high school and this thing completely kicking my @ss.  Trust me, you'll feel like a god the first time you complete the whole thing, using all the proper weight.  It is a true rush.

I love the classic Firm workouts because you don't need any special equipment that costs an arm and a leg.  All you need is floor space, weights, and motivation.  There are some exercises on this workout that have a 2x4 under the heels of the feet, but I go without because I can keep on the balls of my feet during those routines without needing a prop.

Now, on to the DVD specifically.  It has a menu which breaks down the workout to its individual sections, and tells you on the menu how long each section is.  The picture quality is pretty good, considering how old the original recording is.  However, when I put on the DVD, during the opening credits, it randomly jumps to a mid-sentence clip from '20 Questions about Fitness', plays that for a few minutes, then goes back to the credits just in time for the workout to start.  That got me thinking, where is 20 Questions?  Guess what- it's not on the DVD.  That is what kept me from giving it five stars.  It really is a rip-off that they didn't include it.  I wish they had, it was most informative.  It would have been a great bonus feature on the DVD.  For those who never had the VHS, 20 Questions was an informational segment at the end of the tapes on the classic Firm workouts that gave great information and did some myth-busting on things commonly misconstrued about aerobics and weight-training.

Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who seriously wants to get fit.  Even without 20 Questions, it is still worth the money.  Ten workouts will give results!",1248739200,36,4193,4.457180500658762
311875,5,6301065557,I really like this work-out!. You can really feel it. I always get a good sweat. It works all areas of the body. The  aerobics are easy to follow. I highly  recommend this.,1247356800,,172,4.181818181818182

This one is fantastic if you want quick results.  It is a very challenging workout and you have to grow into it, but you will see results after doing it 10 times, even if you don't do the whole thing in the beginning.  I use 3,5,and 10lb. dumbells, just like they recommend.  In the beginning, I couldn't do most of it because it was too much.  I did what I could, and eventually I got to where I did everything.  By that time, I had lost a lot of weight, and was getting complements about my body left and right.  It is worth the money.  I like the music, and I really like the fact that it is very 80's.  Looking at the hairstyles is so hilarious.  Did I really look like that?:0)  The beginning and ending stretches are the best I have ever seen, period.  Don't skip them- they reduce soreness.  If they still have the ""20 questions about fitness"" at the end, then you get a lot of value for the 28 bucks.  It packs a lot of fitness and nutrition info in 30 min.  I learned a LOT from it.  The free weights you need are at any sports store and they are cheap.  The gloves are cheap too, and you need them to keep from getting calluses.

Janet Jones is an awesome and charming instructor who makes working out with weights a pleasureable experience instead of a burdensome one! The mixture of weight work with aerobics and floor work really does produce visible results quickly just as The Firm claims!

I used it so much that it stopped working, and I had to replace it with another VHS about 7 years ago.  I still have a VCR and still use these VHS tapes. They are rather expensive to replace with DVD's when you consider the cost of other workout programs. So the only reason I even keep a VCR around is for my FIRM tapes.  As we get older, our bodies change, and I now mix some harder workouts in with my Firm workouts. I now also own Insanity, P90X1 & 2 as well as some other intense but short cardio programs. But this really is an intense full body workout that combines strength training with some cardio. It's about a half hour of strength training that includes a 5-7 minute blast of cardio exercise, then about a half hour of floor work-abs, hips, buttocks, pecs/chest.  For years, this was my only workout program. I wasn't educated on muscle confusion and the need for changing your workouts. I did only this routine every day for probably 10 years and got great results doing it,  I would get complements while out at the clubs, etc. Now I'm older. Still thin but I won't wear the half tops any more. I would highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have time to sit down and come up with a weekly work out plan where you are trying to hit all of your body parts on your weekly rotation and still get some cardio. This Vol 2 mixed with the other volumes is, in my opinion, perfect for that. The Firm Body Sculpting Basics w Susan Harris (I think this is volume 3) is another favorite and a good complement to this one.",1214524800,4,1687,4.1656441717791415

I did it so often I know it by heart. I also own most of the FIRM videos, and this one is definitely the most difficult of all my exercise tapes.  I actually tape recorded it, and when I travel I take my ipod with me and do it to that (since I know the routine).

You should see my body, thanks to this tape. It takes an hour and you will sweat! The ab work could be a bit tougher, and you have to stretch your pecs a lot more after you're done, otherwise you feel them hurt too much the next day (stretching helps ease pain and elongates your muscles - something you want!)

It's tough as heck, and Janet can do 32 pushups (full plank man style) as if its nothing... that's the one exercise I have the most trouble with. She's in amazing shape. She's charming and interacts with the others just enough not to be corny.

My fiance' laughed at me when I was doing this... I told him do it once, and then laugh.  Heh, he did, and he shut up ever since. Now when I'm doing it he just gulps and leaves the room!

I believe this video was produced in 1988, so you're going to have to get past the 80's music and cheesy leotards.  Janet is a good instructor, but like a previous reviewer has mentioned, she seems almost like a porn star at times-- just the way she presents herself and the way she talks. Her cueing isn't the best, but I find that's one of the fun parts of a new video, that it takes multiple times to master the routine.  It claims to be low-impact, and for the most part it is.  However, I don't call jogging in place and jumping jacks ""low impact"". At the same time, these moves are very reasonable if you're doing them on a soft surface with proper shoes.  Very little equipment is required: you'll need 3 sets of weights, some ankle weights, a short towel for stretching and an optional 2x4 block of wood to rest your feet on. I didn't have the 2x4 and I did just fine. Got a great total body workout, and I was sore the next day-- it hurt to sneeze, but it was a good kind of soreness!",1130198400,8,1103,4.183962264150943

The instructor is (well she sounds like a porn star) but she doesnt annoy me.  The aerobics section is mixed with some high impact (running, jacks, etc) and some aerobics with weights which will make you drip with sweat.

311943,4,6301065557,"This was the first Firm workout I bought about two years ago.  I've gone on to buy eight or nine more, but this one remains one of the toughest of the bunch.  I still reach for it on days when I need a very tough 65-minute workout that will hit almost all my major muscles in both upper and lower body (inner thighs and the upper back don't get much attention here).
I agree with other reviewers about having to get past the eighties muzak and leotards, but this was a very minor point for me.  Note that this is NOT a step workout, like some of the other Firm tapes, and the only equipment you'll need is three sets of weights (3, 5, and 8 pounds for beginners is what they recommend) and a board or something to elevate your heels during bridge work.  Space requirements are reasonable -- I do this tape in a small living room.  There are a fair amount of jogging/jumping jacks intervals, though, so apartment-dwellers may want to keep that in mind.
I only have two real gripes about this workout.  First, the instructor moves VERY quickly, and doesn't talk at all about form.  For example, she'll have you doing standing rows, militaries, and curls with heavy weight very, very quickly, which I suspect leads to extremely poor form.  Most of the arm work is at that fast tempo, in fact, so if you use the heavy weight she calls for, pay very close attention to form.  Beginning lifters should get another tape first, maybe one of the Firm tapes with Tracey Long, who gives excellent instruction without slowing the workout.
My second gripe is that the instructor's cuing could be better.  She'll often forget to cue, or give a slightly confusing cue.  This is only a problem for me during the abs work, when I can't see the TV, and she has you switch sides during oblique twists without actually telling you to.  The other miscues are easy to just watch and adapt to.
Beyond those two things, this is a great workout.  If you're a Firm believer, this one won't disappoint you.",1051488000,21,1979,4.463888888888889

1) A VERY efficient workout: 1 hour will give you weight training, cardio and stretching.
2) Emphasis on upper body weight training, which I loved. You really see results in your sholders, more than with other Firm tapes.
3) Nothing beats the Firm's high quality music. It's made for the workout, and perfectly complements it. It actually reduces your need to look at the screen, a plus when you're doing the floor section.
4) PERFECT for weight loss, because you get your cardio AND weight training in just 1 hour, and YOU WILL SEE RESULTS IN 10 WORKOUTS!!",1033430400,12,681,4.73109243697479

Our bodies' needs have not changed in the last 10-15 years and this work-out gets the job done! I LOVE this work-out but it is not for everyone. To help decide if this is for you, here are some points:
It may not the best choice for you IF:
- you typically hate working out and is looking for something short and fun and easy just to get your body moving.
- you are a beginner who has not worked out ever or in a long time
- you like instructors who entertain you with jokes and/or motivate you with promising results every few minutes of the work out
- you dislike looking at perfect bodies who hardly break a sweat through a long and killer work out - this could be seen as motivational, but if you find it intimidating, this tape is not for you
- you do not have the time in a day for a total 65 minute work-out (you can forward and skip some parts for a shorter work-out but this may not be the best choice for you)
- you have a medical condition that prohibits you from lifting weights or jumping
- you don't like to get down on the floor and do all the classic floor exercises
This IS a GREAT choice for you IF:
- you are serious about getting fit and being in tip-top shape, and you realize and know what it takes and are willing to do it
- you want to see a pleasant (gorgeous!) and no-nonsense instructor who will be there to lead you in a sensational work-out in a calm and professional manner
- you want a work-out that works your whole body and all the muscle groups as well as gives you a great cardio work-out
- you have been exercising for a while and all your basic/beginners work-outs have become a breeze and you yawn while you do them. This tape will give you a new challenge!
- you are already in good shape and would like to maintain your level of fitness in a compact one hour work-out that works every part of your body
- you want to see results - FAST!
On a final note, you will need a set of dumbells for this work-out (3,5 and 8 pounds recommended for women and 5-10-15 for men). Ankle weights are also optionally used, and definitely recommended as you get stronger. You may also want a floor mat for the floor exercises.",1024444800,23,2286,4.116331096196868
311959,5,6301065557,"I purchased this video from a commercial advertisement in 1992 - since then I have worn out two tapes and just ordered a third.  This video helped me go from a size 16 to a size 8 in 9 months (along with eating NORMAL food portions).  Caution should be used.  View the entire tape - even the 20 questions and advise on changing the moves to low impact for the first few weeks of use.  I used no weights when I started until I got all the moves down pat and my form correct.  Then I started to add weights.  Month 2 - I used no weights and 3# weights.  Month 3 - I used no weights, 3# and 5# weights.  That is my max - I wanted to slim, not build.  I do recommend for the advanced user an 8# or greater weight on the trapezius workout for the back (just before the push ups).  A little common sense and patience is all you need to get the body you should have.  I just love it when a man turns his head to look at what I made....besides, what pride I had when I showed up at my 20 year high school reunion looking better than ever - I was the only female who didn't gain weight!

It gives a full body work-out in about an hour along with continuous aerobics.  When I don't have the time to do lower one day, or upper the next, or I miss a day, I can do this tape and not feel as though I have I have been lazy.

As you increase the weights, go double time on the bicep, delt fly reps.  As a matter of fact, I will do the sequence just biceps first (even though Janet switches to delts), then rewind the tape and do the complete set of delts, since I'm using 8 - 10 lb for these, there is no way I'm gonna do half time as she does.  But, that is also the beauty of these tapes, you can modify along the way.  The technique here is to pre-exhaust your muscle, keep you in an aerobic mode while giving the just worked muscle it's rest as your work a second muscle (ex. delts, then biceps and back again).  Back to the beauty part - as I said, you can modify, on days you want more of an aerobics session, use the 3 - 5 lb. weights.

It isn't really much in the aerobics, pulse raising, arena either.  There is only about 20 minutes to get your heart pulsing.  I would alternate this video with one that gets you into that fat-burning heart rate for a longer period of time if you are trying to lose weight.

I found the video to be a little  more focused on the upper body than on the lower body, but you will work  all parts.  Unlike most of the other Firm videos, this tape did very little  cueing for the appropriate range of weights to use.  Personally, I find  that this can be detrimental to a workout because if you choose weights  that are heavier than you should use, it can cause you to use up your  energy and strength prematurely and cause struggling for the remainder of  the video, not to mention that this can increase the risk of injury.  To be  safe, choose lighter weights until you are very familiar with all of the  exercises in the tape.  This tape will provide you with a good, long  workout.",961027200,36,974,4.351955307262569

I've also had severe tennis elbow pain that I've just decided to live with, but found that the workout fixed that problem, too. When that happened, I decided that I would spread the word. If you can stand the music, you can really do your muscular-skeletal system some good by doing this workout. Do the sitting stretches lying on your back to protect your spine if you have back pain.
