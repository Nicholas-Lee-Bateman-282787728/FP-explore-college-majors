8146339,5,B000IMVERS,"I am a huge fan of both Zidane and Mogwai so I knew this movie was made for me. I was totally surprised however by the arc of the action and the way the film captures the rawest human emotions. I could go on and on, but I don't want to ruin the climax.  If it sounds at all appealing to you, get this movie, it is an incredibly rich viewing experience.",1399593600,,352,3.888888888888889
8146340,3,B000IMVERS,The video didn't meet my expectations.  It didn't give enough details about the player or the team.  Not worth the $12 price.,1380758400,,125,4.636363636363637
8146341,1,B000IMVERS,"This so called documentary was a waste of my money and time. As a fan, I have to say this is an insult to Zizou's legacy. Even the picture and sound is extremely poor. I am so disappointed and embarrassed that i got it as a gift for a Zizou fan.",1375056000,,245,3.823529411764706
8146342,1,B000IMVERS,"Ok, maybe I'm a bit early in posting, but I am 30 minutes in and I am really upset by this.  It literally is just camera's following Zidane around the field, he doesn't talk during play which makes it boring, there isn't commentary.  Hopefully at some point this picks up and I am forced to edit this rating, but as for now, I wasted my money.",1301875200,,343,4.181818181818182
8146343,5,B000IMVERS,"This is a very well conceived re-make of an earlier film made about George Best during a Manchester United v Coventry match called ""Fuball wie noch nie"" (Football as Never Before) by Hellmuth Costard.  In the original film only 6 or 8 cameras follow just Georgie around exclusively but still gives the viewer the ambience and the sense of the environment around the player and the match.  This modern re-encarnation takes the match a little further and shows how the world can operate in conjunction with the event as well as seperately from it.  Zidane as a player not only has an effect on the 90,000+ in the Santiago Bernabeu but also on fans across the world.  His every word and his every move exemplifies the influence of the sport on the audience.  Beyond that it's a very true and honest portrayal of the game itself, the beauty, the intricicies, the ugliness, and ultimately it's objectivity.  The game exists regardless of the actors and the audience, and this movie shows exactly that premis.",1279584000,4,1003,4.76878612716763
8146344,4,B000IMVERS,"Missed a chance to see this at the National Gallery in Ottawa, so bought it instead. It will be a present for a huge Zidane fan, and I know he'll be impressed. Very impressive what I've seen so far.",1273968000,3,198,4.102564102564102

8146346,5,B000IMVERS,"This is one of the best docs about football (soccer) ever made and one of the best films detailing a man at his workplace. The filmmakers pick one of the best footballers of his generation in his last season of his career with Real Madrid. Beckham and Ronaldo makes a few cameos but make no doubt about it Zinedine Zidane is the star.
I should warn viewers that this is not a biography of Zizou's life and career but an artist's documentary that follows Zidane around the pitch (with 18 cameras) in a La Liga game at the Bernabeau against Villareal. It is an amazing portrait of a athlete at work as any film ever created.
And the ending is incredible (and no I will not give it away)
Zidane's career, since this film was made, has been clouded by his actions in the 2006 World Cup final, but make no doubt about it he was one of the greats who ever put on a pair of cleats and kicked the ball around, and this film proves it!",1201219200,24,926,4.207865168539326
