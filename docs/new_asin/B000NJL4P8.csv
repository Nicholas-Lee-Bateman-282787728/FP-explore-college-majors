8178321,3,B000NJL4P8,"Here's the 4th box set of 4 disks (two 2-sided disks) from WEW.
It is better than the other three, but it still has some issues.
Still, the best women's troupe out right now is Shimmer.

Here are the positives:
1. A lot fewer of the matches include men.
2. These events take place in a small arena, not a sportsbar.
3. There are no ""repeats"" of matches from previous sets.
4. If you like the ""nurse dances"" they have some of that.
Here are the negatives:
1. Still have a lot of junk you want to fast forward through,
like tirades by the Smoke, and from this idiot named ""T-Barr"".
2. Cameras on the interview segments zoom in and out and may
cause nausea if you watch.
3. They still sometimes skip in-ring action (when you'd rather
they deleted the between-match garbage).
4. Some of the matches are rip-offs, such as a match involving
a 4-foot tall man, and a ""BP"" match that doesn't actually occur.
5. Papa Mae and the stupid Mae family still show up.

Disk 1: From Virginia, features classic WEW matches.
1. Ellie and Jeannie Mae vs. Wildfire
2. Tai Weed vs. Pussy Willow
3. Tara vs. Candie
4. Ellie and Jeannie Mae vs. GI Ho
5. Jeannie Mae vs. Little Louie (crap)
6. Kitten vs. Rebecca Wild (doesn't take place because of Smoke)
7. Heather Faith vs. Wildfire vs. Jazz (tables, but they screw
it up badly at the end)

Disk 2: A tag team tournament (seven matches, but one is a forfeit)
Teams are...
Davey Mae and Cristol, Dawn Mae and Crystal Carmichael,
Angel Williams and Tracy Brooks, ODB and Christie Ricci
Mercedes and Shelley Martinez, Persephone and Vanessa Harding
Tara and Candie, Angel Orsini and Simply Luscious
(losing teams will face each other on next event)

Disk 3: From Philadelphia
1. Tracy Brooks vs. Angel Williams
2. Shelly Martinez vs. Mercedes Martinez
3. ODB vs. Christie Ricci
4. Persephone vs. Vanessa Harding
5. Candie vs. Tara
6. Angel Orsini and Simply Luscious vs. Talia and Tiffany Madison
(for tag team championship)
7. Tai Weed vs. Amy Lee

Disk 4: From Philadelphia
1. Amy Lee vs. Summer
2. Mercedes Martinez vs. Italian Stallion (actually a girl)
vs. April Hunter vs. Sumei Sekai (loser is ""deported"")
3. Talia and Tiffany Madison vs. Becky Bayless and Baby Phat
4. Dawn Mae vs. Tai Weed
5. Dawn Mae vs. GI Ho (this GI Ho is not really the original one)

I would have given it four stars for its enjoyability, but the
action still is not as good as Shimmer, and they need to eliminate
the mistakes that I have listed above.",1187308800,20,2460,4.504484304932736
