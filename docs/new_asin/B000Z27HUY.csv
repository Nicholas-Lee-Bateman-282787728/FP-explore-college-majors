8234629,1,B000Z27HUY,"Amazon: NOVA: Master of the Killer Ants (2007)

Usually NOVA can be relied upon to get the science right and leave viewers with a strong sense of the science side of mixed practices. Unfortunately, this video has the aroma of cultural relativism. While the science is not derided, it remains contaminated.

The setting is the Cameroon and the Mofu people. They depend on millet/sorghum which in turn depends on rain.

Black ants and termites both eat the millet. The army ant named ""jaglavak"" is the biocontrol. But this narrative is mixed with local legends. The termites also cause substantial house damage. These tropical termites are sizeable and good photography explores the mounds and tunnels to expose soldiers, workers and the queen in a useful 5 minute segment. In the village schools, schoolchildren study ""invertebrates"" and termite castes in French. The drought is considered due to human offenses, leading to rituals with ""rain stones,"" clearing of land, rains, and appeal to the sacred mountain spirit. Children hunt for the jaglavak ant. They collect ants and introduce them to the termite mound. Eventually there is a battle between ants and termites but the storyline is obviously contrived, which is easily detected by young students and a problem for the usually reliable NOVA Series.",1369008000,2,1304,5.170616113744076
8234630,3,B000Z27HUY,"This is a very good video if you're looking for a cultural, anthropological piece about the tribe showcased.  That is not what I was looking for.  I was looking for an amazing video about killer ants.  I had seen one such video years ago, and have been trying to find it ever since.  Apparently it is not in circulation.  So this was good, but it wasn't a documentary about killer ants",1362182400,,385,4.366197183098592
8234631,5,B000Z27HUY,"I am not here to judge religion,people, film producers, or politics. I am here to review what is one of the best, most wonderfull PBS productions I've seen in quite a while. They should have been selling this film during the membership drive this spring break!

I won't have the money for it for a few weeks but I plan on purchasing it, for sure!!

NOVA stuck to their guns and showed the life style as it probably really is, which is scraping survival out of the bleak existence of Western African Cameroon. They did the best they could, I imagine it is hard to film in conflict countries without maintaining some political correctness with the authorities, or you will not be allowed to film again.

I'm sure folks are intelligent enough to filter this out. It was very heart warming to see the kids enjoying nature on their food hunt and recon for the infamous red army ants mentioned in the introduction. Everything leading up to this was very interesting to me. As only the third generation to escape the mud huts on the prairie, I can identify with these folks. The only real difference was we lived in modern homes and used machinery,motorized irrigation, and pesticides. But this only during the last 50 years. Much of our spare time was spent harvesting the orchards and gardens, which still involved heavy manual labor just like these folks. I'd say 60% of our time a day was spent on food recovery and preparation. Way more than anyone would tolerate now days in the USA anyway.

We also had our war with pests, and not all of them could be dealt with by pesticides. Bull snakes were encourage to move into our farmyards to keep the rattlesnakes away, and red/black prairie ants to keep the fire ants at bay, just to name a few instances.

But straight to the jist of why I recommend this movie is the remarkable achievment in preserving a history of what is hopefully a hard life dissappearing like it did for us, at the turn of the last century. The story line was beautifly executed and filmed, and you just had to fall in love with the cute grandfather who had the wise woodcraft(or witchcraft if you insist) to use bio-specie warfare against the terrible termites plaguing the village.

I can't understand the vitriol from some reviewers for the sciences used in this assesment. After all Anthropology is as important as the entomology shown in this film, at a time when human and natural cooperation was closer and more finely tuned than we have now. Woodcraft is a 6th sense that we have lost in this modern society. It is sad too, as it helped my beloved uncle survive Iwo Jima.

The music was straight from African traditions and used sparingly and with only original African cultural instrumentation. The filming was fantastic, and the macro-filmography of the insects spellbinding!

I highly recommend this film, although I hope it is remastered as a blu-ray; as this belongs in any thinking person's library. And any compassionate person's heart as well!! Truely a piece of art!",1269043200,2,3001,4.681214421252372
8234632,5,B000Z27HUY,"A wonderful film about Mofu life with insects; particularly, termites, ants, and a unique bird.  Viewers will see a real sense of community life amongst villagers and their relationship with mother earth.

Perhaps, negative reviewers of this film should one day be responsible for going into a non-English village and shooting/writing/filming/marketing/networking/airing a beautiful story like, ""Master of the Killer Ants.""  It is always easy to criticize than it is to create a masterpiece; especially an entertaining-educational program with a perfect beginning, middle, and end.  In fact, more of the world should celebrate rain or water, and have more harmonious relationships with their environments, as this film cleverly pictured.",1218844800,5,737,5.796296296296297
8234633,3,B000Z27HUY,"This film is not really about an ant king, or ant overlord, or ant wizard.

There is certainly no human ""master"" depicted here as the humans worship & pray to the ants and beg the ants for help & intervention against the termites.

The show is really only marginally about ants at all.  It is how humans can keep their own hands clean by making other species fight to the death.

The humans play a game of ""let's you and them fight"" by causing ants to attack termites.  NOVA films this grisly battle and you have to wonder if human chemicals wouldn't have provided a cleaner and more ""humane"" death.",1207785600,5,599,4.409090909090909
8234634,2,B000Z27HUY,"This film is a glorification of the Mofu, a tribe living in the former French colony of Cameroon. PBS describes this program as a study of how the Mofu relate social insects to their own politico-religious beliefs as well as to their systems of kinship and social relations. In fact, the French made program is a celebration of primitive communism.

  The basic theme is that a villager's share of an admittedly unique communal village structure is being attacked by termites. Rather than effectively deal with the problem by applying a common commercial (read ""evil capitalist"") pesticide, a killer ant, the jaglavak is sought. A village shaman is brought in to pray that the ant, which appears only after the onset of the rainy season, may be found.

  The villagers are shown as always happy, content with their lives as subsistence farmers. There is not a road to be seen. No electricity. No mechanical or electrical appliances. No running water. No bicycles or automobiles. No stores. Lots of raggedy clothes and children with the protruding bellies indicative of malnutrition.

  It is clear from the narrative that the villagers are dependent on a single crop and entirely at the mercy of nature from year to year.

  While there is a single scene showing a school in session, everything else celebrates primitivism. Shamans pray to bring rain and, presumably, recovery from illness. A robe clad hereditary chief may or may not listen a village council of elders.

  The village children are sent out to find the jaglavak and bring it back to exterminate the termites. In this brief sequence, we are informed that insects make up a part of the local diet, indicating a shortage of protein sources.

  There is then a harvest sequence that is heavily reminiscent of the many fine Soviet propaganda films of the 1920s and 30s. The grain is harvested by hand, threshed by hand, processed by hand. No mention is made of the fact that this indicates a purely subsistence level of life. The Soviet films at least featured a tractor or two.

  In fact, my reaction was one of shock and sadness. Shock that the billions of US and European foreign aid dollars have made no impact on life in this village. Shock at the level of ignorance. Shock and sadness at the filmmaker's celebration of the primitive communism that provides misery for most with a bit of plenty for those who are ""more equal than others"".

  In all, ""Master of the Killer Ants"" is propaganda. It is frightening to think that it will probably be shown in public schools as a lesson in ""diversity"" and furthering the ""it takes a village"" myth.

  Cameroon is not a pleasant place to live. Life is short, nasty and brutish. Cameroon has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Infectious diseases are rife. Almost half the nation lives below the poverty line. A third of the population is entirely illiterate.

  You would know none of this from ""Master of the Killer Ants"". This is propaganda celebrating the politically correct idea that communism and living with nature is just fine. Perhaps, if you think insects should be a primary source of protein, it is.
