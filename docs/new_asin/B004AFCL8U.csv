8420132,2,B004AFCL8U,"I'm a huge fan of progressive rock, and was looking forward to this DVD arriving. Sadly it's mostly stuff that Hudson music repackaged from previously released DVD's. If you have the 2008 Modern drummer festival you already own a good majority of the stuff on this DVD. There's really no need to buy it. Although, my biggest compliant about this DVD is that the title is ""Ultimate Drum Lessons: Progressive rock."" The DVD contains very little in the way of instructional material.",1291766400,10,480,4.865853658536586
