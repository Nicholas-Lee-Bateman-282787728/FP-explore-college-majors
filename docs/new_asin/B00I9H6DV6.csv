6254498,5,B00I9H6DV6,"I have been following the REFIT trio for over two years.  Imagine how excited I became when they released their first DVD! I danced, praised, sweated, and lost inches! This DVD is appropriate for kids as much as adults!  Bring it into your home, work, and churches!  If you're a fan, like I am, of Toby Mac, Mandisa, and Mary Mary then get this DVD and dance your heart out.  And believe me, you will sweat!  As a REFIT instructor, their routines are brought into class with class approval! This will become your number one fitness DVD of 2014.  It's never too late to start your own revolution!!  #lovemesomerefit",1396742400,,614,4.577981651376147

You will have so much fun dancing that you won't feel like you're working out (although you will know it by how much you will sweat!). Order both REFIT Dance Fitness DVD Volume 1 and REFIT Dance Fitness DVD Volume 2!",1396742400,2,477,4.3

8640163,5,B00I9H6DV6,One day I was working out to some dance videos on You Tube. I felt really guilty because dancing is my favorite form of exercise but the music was really inappropriate and the dance moves were too provacative. Then Refit Revolution came up as one of the recommended videos on the side of the video. I clicked on it and I've been hooked ever since. I would definitely recommend both DVDs. The music is great and the dance moves are fun. God is good. <3 :),1403654400,8,454,4.290697674418604
